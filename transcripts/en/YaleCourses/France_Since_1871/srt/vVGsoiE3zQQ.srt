1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,780
I'm going to talk about anarchism today.
And especially,

2
00:00:04,781 --> 00:00:08,290
I'm gonna talk about the
life and death of a one guy.

3
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:11,140
Somebody I don't admire I on me,

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,650
but in a way he represents some aspects
of the origin of modern terrorism in,

5
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:20,110
in late 19th century Paris.

6
00:00:20,111 --> 00:00:21,940
And I guess if you're gonna
write a book about somebody,

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,290
it's not a bad idea to pick someone
who only lived to be age 21, uh,

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,240
can make for a shorter book, uh, cause
he was getting, uh, as you'll see,

9
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:36,130
uh, in 1894. Um,

10
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,330
so, uh, there we go. Um, first of all,

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,220
no anarchists.
I'm like,

12
00:00:42,221 --> 00:00:47,221
socialists did not want to capture
the state seize control of the state.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,770
They wanted to destroy the state.
They wanted to abolish the state. Uh,

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,960
they viewed a political participation.
And in this way,

15
00:00:55,961 --> 00:01:00,961
there are other like to syndicates as
are propping up a capitalism and its army

16
00:01:01,901 --> 00:01:05,710
defending the interests of wealthy people.
Um,

17
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,550
the first anarchist was
a man called a poodle.

18
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:15,130
A who's influenced really a
is in the 1850s and 1860s,

19
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:20,350
uh, and put on, was from, from the east
of France. He was from Bezos Song, uh,

20
00:01:20,351 --> 00:01:21,340
in the east,

21
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,720
and he once wrote a pamphlet
called property is theft.

22
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,940
Uh, in 1841, uh, he met too much
property or unearned property,

23
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:35,300
was theft. Uh, but it was a
provocative kind of title and he wants,

24
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,540
wrote the following to
be governed is to watch,

25
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:43,300
inspected to be watched, inspected,
spied upon directed, law-driven,

26
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,200
numbered, regulated, enrolled,
indoctrinated, preached at controlled,

27
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,630
checked, estimated, valued, censored,

28
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:55,550
commanded by creatures who have neither
the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue

29
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,540
to do so.

30
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,820
To be governed is to be at every
operation that every transaction noted.

31
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:06,740
Registered, counted, taxed, stamped,
measured, numbered, assessed the license,

32
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,000
authorize, admonish, prevented,
forbidden, a reformed,

33
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,680
a corrected,
punished,

34
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,730
and on the pretext of public utility
and the name of the general interest to

35
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:20,960
replaced under contribution,
drilled, fleeced, exploited,

36
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:24,710
monopolized, extorted from
squeezed, hoaxed robbed.

37
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,690
And then at the slightest resistance,

38
00:02:26,691 --> 00:02:31,550
the first word of complaint to be
repressed, fired upon vilified, harassed,

39
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,780
hunted down, abused
club, disarmed bound. Um,

40
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,880
check in prison, imprisoned,
uh, judged, condemn, shot,

41
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:45,620
deported sacrifice, sold,
betrayed, and to Crown, all mocked,

42
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:48,400
ridiculed, a derided, outraged,

43
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:51,110
dishonored that is government debt.
It's,

44
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:56,111
it's justice that is hits it's morality
now predominant followed by two

45
00:02:56,941 --> 00:03:01,570
important Russian, uh, anarchists,
both of whom I won't talk about,

46
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,980
but who extremely interesting.

47
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:07,480
And both of whom were Noble's a one as
a guy called Peter Kropotkin and the

48
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:12,160
other, the terrifying, quite
terrifying. Uh, Mikhail Bakunin.

49
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,310
Um, and they become a quite
important, um, Kropotkin, uh,

50
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,930
who was a gentleman, a geographer, and
once toasted by the, by the king of,

51
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,870
of England, uh, and in the end, uh,
was horrified by the Bolshevik, uh, uh,

52
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,030
a revolution.

53
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,890
He was among those who came up with
the term propaganda by the deed.

54
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,720
That is the belief that, that the
masters were potentially revolutionary.

55
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,800
And it took a single spark,
a single assassination,

56
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,360
a single bomb to start revolution rolling.

57
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,840
And our kiss a assassinated,
depending on how you count it,

58
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,900
five or six or seven heads of state,
uh,

59
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:55,690
in the late decades of the 19th century,

60
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,960
including a President Mckinley of the
United States who was a shot or stabbed,

61
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:04,060
I can't remember which in, um, in Buffalo,

62
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:08,320
New York in 1901,
uh,

63
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,820
that number included as we'll see
in a while, a Saudi council, c, O,

64
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:17,270
s t a r n o t, uh, who
was the president of,

65
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:22,000
of France. So I want to
begin with, with a bomb.

66
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,600
And I've had, because of this
bomb years and years afterward,

67
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,580
I've had the rather odd, a
feeling of twice having eaten, uh,

68
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,940
in the cafe restaurant that
my book's subject blew up. Uh,

69
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,320
the cafe a terminus, and it
is a turning point in, uh,

70
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,610
the origins of modern terrorism.
On February 12th,

71
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:47,620
the 1894 a pale seeing young
man called [inaudible],

72
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,790
prepared a bomb in his room in Paris.

73
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,320
He hid it in his closing along with a
loaded pistol in a knife and he headed

74
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:59,860
toward the elegant boulevards
near the Paris opera,

75
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,590
which had been completed 20 years earlier.

76
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,260
He wanted to throw the bomb and kill
as many people as possible on restock

77
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,690
before the opera itself,
which as you can see,

78
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:13,840
resembles a giant golden wedding cake.

79
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,220
There was a fancy ball going on and he
knew he could not get past the guards to

80
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:22,420
get close enough to claim any victims.
He then checked out the restaurant,

81
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:27,040
be no followed by the cafe America
and then the most chic of the mall,

82
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,180
the Cafe Dilla pay in the Garland hotel,
which is still there.

83
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,780
He was in some way a flaneur
and intellectual who had
briefly in his life and

84
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:38,890
something of a dandy,
but if so,

85
00:05:38,891 --> 00:05:43,390
he was an impoverished Flender who lived
on the margins of urban life and who

86
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:45,010
now came to the grand boulevard,

87
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,570
not just to observe what detached
distance as the flood or did,

88
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,110
but to hate and now to kill.

89
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,550
He moved on finding each place
was not crowded. A crowded enough.

90
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,270
At 8:00 PM,
he reached the cafe Termi nous

91
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,740
right next to the golf Santa, the czar
around the corner from the guard Salazar,

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,690
and it's, the cafe was slowly filling
up. He ordered a beer and soon, uh,

93
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,290
another and then a cigar.

94
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,130
And in a rather an anarchist like gesture,

95
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,630
he paid for them is the
small orchestra played on.

96
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:29,060
About an hour later, he
walked to the doorway, turned,
lit the fuse with a cigar.

97
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,500
He sued the bomb back into the cafe,
which was now very crowded,

98
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,320
already famous for its great expositions.

99
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:40,580
Paris more than ever identified with
ledger and with consumerism had become a

100
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:44,630
permanent exposition in itself.
It's boulevards, the staging ground,

101
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:47,180
as you'll see later in
the course for the belly.

102
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:51,670
PUK department stores welcome clients
with Dazzling Electric Lights and arrange

103
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,060
shop windows, inspiring Zola to call
them that cathedrals of modernity.

104
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,330
The isles of the department stores were,
as has been argued,

105
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,290
a continuation of the great
boulevards themselves.

106
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,020
In contrast, the poor workers lived along
the narrow grey streets of the calc ta.

107
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,430
Popu there. Uh, this is not a county
pope you there, this is, uh, the,

108
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,640
the terminus that will be in
neighborhoods of eastern Paris.

109
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,780
We're cholera had killed
a as late as 1884.

110
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,430
The rebuilding of Paris by mine in the
fifties and sixties had chased thousands

111
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:30,230
of ordinary people, uh, by
higher rents to the exterior,

112
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,380
a neighborhoods of northern Paris,
northeastern Paris,

113
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,500
and to their working class suburbs.

114
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,270
But the capital of the world that is
Paris was no longer the capital of

115
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:42,104
revolution.

116
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:47,000
Soldiers and Paris seem to be police
and soldiers seem to be everywhere.

117
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,850
And there were indeed many
more of them for that matter.

118
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:54,490
Ost Mons boulevards were too
wide for barricades to August.

119
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,670
And Wow. The impression is painting
the new boulevards that line, the, the,

120
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,880
that the buildings that lined
the boulevards were cold in,

121
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,760
lined up like soldiers at review.

122
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:10,060
A nice description of the consolidation
of state power in 19th century France on

123
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:15,641
May Day 1891 troops fired on demonstrators
killing women and children in the

124
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:19,250
small industrial town in the north of me.
Uh,

125
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:23,510
woolens town France may not then have
had strong executive authority because of

126
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:26,390
the fear of Caesar Ism
after two Napoleon's,

127
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,450
but no other state was so centralized.

128
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,760
And so in the early 1890s did anarchist,
uh,

129
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:38,930
begin to create small
organizations along the move,

130
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,760
which is the room move tab behind the
Ponti Y'all where a guy calls you on Gob

131
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:48,910
published one of the anarchist newspapers
at number one 40 here and there in the

132
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,230
Latin quarter, but above
all in Mamacita, uh,

133
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:57,250
and in these northern industrial
regions and beyond in,

134
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,740
uh, uh, suburbs. Now
the 1880s and nineties,

135
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,920
will as you, you may
already know, uh, we're,

136
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:06,720
will be remembered as a time of scandal.

137
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:10,260
The sleazy Panama Canal
scandal and lots of other ones.

138
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:14,700
The president's son in law is selling
the ledge own donor, uh, et cetera.

139
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,070
And the memory of the Paris commune
loomed large for anarchists.

140
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,690
More than 25,000 people
had been gunned down.

141
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,420
And now from the heights of Moma
and from Bellville, uh, another, uh,

142
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,050
peripheral neighborhood anarchist looked
down on the flashing lights of the

143
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:35,590
Capitol, and they hated many,
admired the Russian anarchists,

144
00:09:35,591 --> 00:09:40,560
Michael Bakunin, uh, the, uh, who for
whom destruction was quote unquote,

145
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,690
a creative passion that would bring
about the end of the state. Capitalism,

146
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,620
uh, and private property,
uh, the modern state, but,

147
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,010
and wrote with all its terrible means
of action given to them by modern

148
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:56,280
centralization was becoming
an immense crushing,

149
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:01,370
threatening reality as those slaughtered
Komi now saw ops close in May of 1871.

150
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:10,130
And so a wave of anarchist bombings swept
the capital between 1892 in 1894 they

151
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:15,450
ended with the assassination
of a Saudi council, uh,

152
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,430
in June of that year in Lino,
um,

153
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,590
after two attempts on his life,
King Umberto,

154
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:27,150
the first of Italy noted
that assassination was
quote, a professional risk,

155
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,450
and indeed he was later
assassinated himself.

156
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:36,090
Yet many of the anarchists were,
were people of peace. Uh, indeed,

157
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:41,130
uh, and, and women of peace.
In the case of Louisa Michelle,
about whom you, you can,

158
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,390
uh, uh, can read, uh, for, uh,

159
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,720
for core Plotkin and before Him who'd
all, uh, the goal was the primitive,

160
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:52,890
the goal was sort of communities that
would exist without the state. Uh,

161
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:56,700
Kropotkin they had lived in the French
is Johan Mountains in the east and also

162
00:10:56,701 --> 00:10:58,080
in Switzerland.
Uh,

163
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:02,560
and they're watchmakers seem to get
along fine without the intrusion, uh,

164
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,540
of, uh, of the state. But
yet, as I said before,

165
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:11,630
it was a Kropotkin who accept it and may
have created the phrase propaganda by

166
00:11:12,181 --> 00:11:16,380
the deed. Uh, sometimes,
uh, attributed to, uh,

167
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,090
the Italian anarchists, Mala Testa,
who had lots of influence in, um,

168
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,043
in Spain,

169
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,340
in Italy and in Argentina who doesn't
look like such a terrifying guy himself,

170
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,310
uh, when you see him there. But again,

171
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:33,300
the belief that a single act of violence
would be the spark that would bring

172
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,460
social revolution.
Now,

173
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,790
Kropotkin later had doubts about
this and he said, personally,

174
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,290
I hate these explosions,

175
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,670
but I cannot stand as a judge to
condemn those who are driven to despair.

176
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,751
It can.

177
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:50,751
He had after all an 1880 describe the
importance of permanent revolt by oral and

178
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:54,850
written propaganda by the knife,
the rifle and dynamite.

179
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:59,290
Everything that is not
legal is good for us.

180
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,480
Now, dynamite was invented by
that man of the peace prize,

181
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,500
Alfred Nobel in 1868.

182
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,360
And what it seemed to do was
level the playing field. Uh,

183
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,870
it seemed to represent a modern
revolutionary alchemy, uh,

184
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,090
and as a compensation of for many evils,

185
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:23,980
for humiliation and weakness
for discrimination and
frustration and anger at

186
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:26,740
social exploitation and injustice.

187
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:31,640
The German anarchist Johan most who
came to the United States, um, he,

188
00:12:31,641 --> 00:12:35,890
we had written in his newspaper freedom
that it was within the power of dynamite

189
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:39,390
to destroy capitalism.
Justin had been within the power of,

190
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:43,720
of gunpowder and the rifle to white
feudalism from the face of the earth.

191
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,830
And American anarchist crowed
before being hung in Chicago,

192
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,610
Haymarket 1886, uh, in given,

193
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,540
given given dynamite to the downtrodden,
millions of the globe,

194
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:00,670
science has truly done its best work.
The famous

195
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,940
Robert Shoal,
Francois [inaudible] took this to heart.

196
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,630
He had been born in, in non poverty
near Santa tn in 59, his father,

197
00:13:11,631 --> 00:13:16,630
a Dutch mill hand who abandoned his wife
and four children in primary school and

198
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:17,410
it mass.

199
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,220
He was embarrassed by having closed
shows so shabby that they resembled those

200
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,070
worn by beggars.
He worked here and there,

201
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,410
but periods of unemployment became longer.

202
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,160
He turned toward anarchism
also to grave robbing,

203
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:35,460
counterfeiting and finally
murder strangling a strange
old hermit who had a lot

204
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:41,761
of money stashed away in his
house in the hills near Santa Tn.

205
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,240
He was arrested,

206
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:48,040
managed to escape the police wagon and
went to Paris living under an assumed

207
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:52,540
name in 1891 police fired on
demonstrators on the boulevard,

208
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,690
p sheep in Paris on the edge of Paris.

209
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:58,300
Three were hauled to a police
station and they were beaten up,

210
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,620
put on trial and co two condemned
to long prison sentences.

211
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,560
Ravish shoals,
two deeds followed.

212
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,790
He bombed the houses have two of the
magistrates on the boulevard, Sandra math,

213
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,260
very elegant neighborhood. And on
the route of clichy. Uh, what, uh,

214
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,970
on the way home he stopped
in a restaurant called Le v,

215
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,560
v e r y with an accent
on the boulevard Magenta.

216
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:27,520
A way to remember to scar he had
on his left hand. Three days later,

217
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:31,180
he went back to the same place
to eat because he'd eaten well.

218
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,440
It took 10 policemen to subdue them.
See this hand,

219
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:40,650
he told judge and jurors it is killed
as many bourgeois as it has fingers.

220
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,930
He was teen on the 11th of July, 1892, uh,

221
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:50,740
in the Luau.
And when Brazil several days later,

222
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,940
a destroyed the restaurant.

223
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,030
He killing the pots hall,

224
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:01,090
the owner leading to the ghoulish punned
that served as an anarchist signature.

225
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,270
Viv Costume,
Ravish Shul.

226
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:10,300
So terrified contemporaries that for a
time his name became a French verb to

227
00:15:11,281 --> 00:15:14,660
revel show eight [inaudible]
somebody was to dynamite them.

228
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,380
And after his death,
the anarchists of Paris and they're,

229
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:21,830
they're exiled friends in London
from all over the continent, uh,

230
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:26,090
debated long into the night.
The wisdom of such attacks would print.

231
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,290
Here, you can see it by
the artists. Charlotte.

232
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:32,480
Mohan reproduced in a widely read
anarchist newspaper portrayed.

233
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,950
Ravi shoal is a martyr,

234
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,090
his defiant heroic face set
within the frame of a guillotine.

235
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:43,220
Some sympathizers began to compare
their martyr Robert Shoal to sort of a

236
00:15:43,221 --> 00:15:47,040
violent Jesus Christ,
both Christ and Robert Shoal.

237
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,400
We're 33 when they were executed and out.

238
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,920
An anarchist song sang a song called
La Rava showed that is the song of Rev,

239
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,790
a show to uh,
uh,

240
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:03,020
the tune of ha a song from the French
Revolution in the great city of Paris

241
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:08,490
live, the well fed bourgeois
and the destitute who have
empty stomachs but they,

242
00:16:08,491 --> 00:16:11,770
they have long teeth,
long live rava shoal.

243
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:16,400
Let's dance the robber shoal a
long live the sound of explosions.

244
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,740
So it will be so,
it will be [inaudible]

245
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,930
in his eulogy for a robber Shawl and
anarchist critic art critic Paul, a. Dot.

246
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,040
And literary critic Paul,

247
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:33,041
a dom warned that the real murderer
robber shul will open an era and it did,

248
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,720
uh,
an anarchist writer outrage.

249
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,720
Public opinion by provocatively stating
what do the victims matter if the

250
00:16:41,151 --> 00:16:43,720
gesture is beautiful.
Bull.

251
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,940
Just a vertical psychosis took hold of
Paris with people of means afraid to go

252
00:16:49,581 --> 00:16:53,300
to red, good restaurants or the
theater and in Nice neighborhoods,

253
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,680
people fearing to rent two
magistrates for fear of lay.

254
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,940
Dina Meteye,

255
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,360
the dynamites hours near
nearly 20 Parisian dailies
carried each installment of

256
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:09,880
anarchist attack. This is a bomb.
This is a cold meat. It's a,

257
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,540
it's a, it's a, it's a pan. It's
a casserole. Uh, but it's a bomb.

258
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,860
Hundreds of scrawled we, and here's
the first, you know, they, they,

259
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:22,520
they advantage of this time that the
wagons that did come to, to, to detonate,

260
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,810
uh, and to make safe as best they can,
these objects. And they kept filing,

261
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:30,350
finding joke bombs and sardine
cans and stuff like that.

262
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,890
And so here's the municipal chemist,
the Guy Calls Ya,

263
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,950
who's checking this out.
Uh,

264
00:17:36,951 --> 00:17:39,950
hundreds of scrawled threats and
which I read, I might, you know,

265
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,850
they're in the archives there,
uh,

266
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,890
arrived to a property owners
and the concierge, uh, uh,

267
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,840
to people of means, uh, uh,

268
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:53,940
by the Avengers of Robert Shoal a or
an anarchist from the neighborhood,

269
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,210
uh, address to an exploiter
of the proletarian. Finally,

270
00:17:57,211 --> 00:18:02,040
the day when a social justice will
arrive next Sunday, the 1st of May,

271
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,090
you will be blown up,

272
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:08,510
signed Ladina meat and in Monaca a
benefit dance for anarchist played the

273
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,720
dynamite Polka, uh, as one of the dances,

274
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:18,240
the well known next act
on the 9th of December,

275
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,410
1893 August of [inaudible],

276
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,830
an unemployed worker distraught and
being unable to feed his family,

277
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:28,010
tossed a small bomb filled with tax
thumbtacks into the Chamber of Deputies.

278
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:32,910
His goal was not to kill. There were
several scratches on the deputies,

279
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,690
but to call attention to the plight
of the poor who situations seem to be

280
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:39,630
getting worse and worse.
He was captured on the spot.

281
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:44,190
The get your immediately,
instantaneously after a,

282
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:48,240
a brief trial severed his
head as he defiantly shouted,

283
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:52,350
the obligatory long live anarchy a meal.

284
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:54,030
On Ray's father,

285
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:57,570
a militant Republican who wrote poetry.

286
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:00,570
He had been elected to the commune
from the 10th, or only small,

287
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:04,410
and was a member of the central committee
of the Federated National Guard.

288
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:07,750
And the Paris commune.
He fled under the, uh,

289
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:12,390
a sentence of death to
Spain. Um, and in Catalonia,

290
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:14,050
he worked in the mines,
uh,

291
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:18,240
turning from socialism to anarchism
cause the anarchists were terribly

292
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:21,800
influential, uh, in Spain, right
through the Spanish civil war. I,

293
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:26,310
particularly in Barcelona, uh, and
also in under the Sia in the south.

294
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,410
And Meta was born in 1872, uh,
in a suburb of, of Barcelona,

295
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:36,270
uh, dominated by the textile factories.
He had two brothers fought Shanae,

296
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,850
uh, who, uh, was older, who had the
same name as his father and Judah,

297
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,700
who was 15 in 1894 following
his father's death, uh,

298
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:50,340
in 1882 from what appear to be
mercury poisoning a madam, he,

299
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:54,620
uh, returned to Paris with her
children, and it's the region, uh,

300
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,110
in mule became a pupil
of the city of Paris, uh,

301
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:02,460
receiving the equivalent of a
scholarship, uh, to, uh, school,

302
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,520
uh, outside of Paris. Uh,

303
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,410
his mother bought or had a little bit
of land that had been in the family,

304
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:15,270
uh, and found, uh, started up in Obash,
uh, right down the street from this.

305
00:20:15,271 --> 00:20:16,650
I was actually an end.

306
00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:20,250
I was actually able to find it to go out
to this place called Braven, which now,

307
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,790
you know, strangely enough is not
all that far from you. Oh, Disney,

308
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,890
but then was truly, uh, in,
uh, in, in the countryside. So,

309
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,490
uh, I mean it only becomes a
scholarship student. Uh, he, uh,

310
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,620
he's very smart.

311
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,970
He gets a certificates of merits in all
the schools he goes to and he gets his

312
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:42,740
box, his baccalaureate exam,
you passed us as the age 16, uh,

313
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,710
which was a pretty tough to do.
Um, he was examined in physics,

314
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,820
math and chemistry, and he
would put some of the later, uh,

315
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,380
to use as we shall see the last
report on his scholarship red.

316
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,680
He will begin studies next year
at the Ecole polytechnique,

317
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:02,140
which is one of the grounds
they call the big, you know,

318
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:05,080
military engineering school.
Extraordinarily hard to get in.

319
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,950
He was classified as Adam deceived
that as he could be admitted.

320
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:13,180
But after passing one part of the exam,
he failed the oral exam,

321
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,920
but he could have taken it again.

322
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:19,300
He claimed that one of his friends threw
a stink bomb into the room when he was

323
00:21:19,301 --> 00:21:22,440
taking the exam. Uh, and, uh, you know,

324
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,020
said later that he vowed vengeance on
bourgeois society, blah, blah, blah. Uh,

325
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,530
that wasn't the case. Um, he
took a position with an uncle,

326
00:21:29,531 --> 00:21:32,500
an engineer working on a
water project in Venice,

327
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,140
but he precipitously returned to France.

328
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:40,150
He dabbled in spiritism trying to
contact, uh, the sole of his dead father.

329
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,430
And that's where we try to move
tables around and, and, and,

330
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,770
and all of that is anarchist friend,

331
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:48,100
a shot Amato total claim that he lost
his footing and fell into the abyss of

332
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:53,101
spiritual spiritism even becoming a medium
of incarnation and wasted his health

333
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,180
in such exhausting experience experiments
because he longed for knowledge,

334
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,230
but he left it all behind.
Uh, and, uh, in Paris,

335
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:06,070
he worked here and there while
living on the margins of urban life.

336
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,540
His brother a false to ne,
uh,

337
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:14,910
became an anarchist and was a prominent
orchard at the meetings and debates held

338
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:19,090
in smokey, smokey halls and
cafes on the edge of Paris,

339
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,390
principally more math,
uh, and the full bull, uh,

340
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:25,030
do tops and in the Latin quarter.

341
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:30,270
And he went to jail in 1894 for
things that he'd written immediately.

342
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,200
Now,
20 years of old,

343
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:37,060
20 years of age of what La [inaudible] Mu,
uh,

344
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:42,061
he was called microbe by his classmates
because it was relatively small a size.

345
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,200
He was Pale,

346
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:48,100
deep set black eyes as you saw and sport
at the beginnings of a blonde beard on

347
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:50,290
his chin to go with chestnut hair.

348
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:55,470
He was devoted to his mother and
would walk or take the train out to a,

349
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,880
not a really nearby station,
uh, to go and, and, uh,

350
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,270
and visit her, uh, and there with a bar,

351
00:23:04,271 --> 00:23:07,720
several tables with workers
drinking wine, the inevitable, uh,

352
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:11,700
checkered tablecloth, green
shutters, and a red brick roof, uh,

353
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,310
and chickens a poking around. And, um,

354
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,190
laundry hanging out to dry. Uh, as I said,

355
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:23,280
it was a village and the other 120
francs that a immunotherapy you earned a

356
00:23:24,701 --> 00:23:29,530
month, he gave about a third of his
mother to his, uh, to his mother.

357
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,310
Um, here she is, uh,

358
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:37,420
down below and there she is up
above on the left, prematurely aged.

359
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,240
Uh, and that is one of
the places that he, uh,

360
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,390
that he lived that we'll
see later where I've,

361
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,810
I've been to everywhere that he lived,

362
00:23:43,811 --> 00:23:47,210
I've got managed to get into the buildings
I've everywhere. He lived a sort of,

363
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,850
you kind of walk around and follow them.
I don't admire him,

364
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:50,870
but it's interesting to try to,

365
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,030
to try to see what he saw and that's what
I really love about history. Uh, anyway,

366
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:59,540
so he, he began meeting with
some of the anarchist groups.

367
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:01,160
He read Kropotkin his great book,

368
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:06,161
the Conquest of bread as well as
works by Mala Testa and various French

369
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:07,820
counterparts.

370
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:12,560
His two targets were private property
and authority to vicious germs,

371
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,790
as he called them.

372
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:17,570
That formed the base of contemporary
societies that he wrote have to be

373
00:24:17,571 --> 00:24:21,320
destroyed,
eradicated from social life.

374
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,680
He remained an intellectual,
somewhat detached,

375
00:24:24,681 --> 00:24:29,210
arguably from those people who crowded
into these anarchist meetings or who came

376
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,960
to get for once a bite to eat in the
various lectures where soup was served to

377
00:24:35,571 --> 00:24:37,790
the poor afterward.
Um,

378
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:42,290
in contrast to y'all who loved the
people by almost the guy executed for

379
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:47,180
throwing the TAC bomb, a Mulatto
remembered immediate, only loved the idea.

380
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:52,540
He felt a mark estrangement from the
ignorant and survival plebs Plebeians,

381
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,340
uh, a feeling distinctive, uh,

382
00:24:55,341 --> 00:25:00,341
also have a number of literary and
artistic anarchist by whom he met.

383
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,030
Uh, no, no, uh, uh, less, uh,
a painter then can be, uh, uh,

384
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,860
[inaudible] Ho who was a Pizarro
who, who was, uh, an anarchist. Uh,

385
00:25:09,861 --> 00:25:10,161
and,

386
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:14,600
and mark also was the center of this
sort of literary and cultural anarchism,

387
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:18,350
uh, the, the anarchism of the
sort of intellectual elite, uh,

388
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,410
who lived in [inaudible] because
it was cheaper and they're,

389
00:25:21,411 --> 00:25:25,490
they're the next generation removed
down to, uh, uh, Montparnasse.

390
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:28,760
And then when math would already become
the sort of tourist trap it is now

391
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:33,450
though, it's still has, uh, it's,
uh, it's charms. Um, I mean all,

392
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,910
he was a loner.

393
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,650
He never spoke in public
as far as we know though.

394
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:43,130
He didn't shout out some things
at one it meeting once. Uh,

395
00:25:43,131 --> 00:25:47,690
he was described later after his
death is the sounds used of anarchy.

396
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,270
Uh,
sounds use was one of them was a cold,

397
00:25:50,271 --> 00:25:53,420
steely guy who had ripped off
his mother's silver during the,

398
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,920
before the French revolution,

399
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:58,640
who became a member of the
committee of public safety. And uh,

400
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,270
he and Robespierre where
sort of main men of,

401
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:06,790
of the committee of public safety. Uh,
so he didn't speak like false Janae,

402
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,670
who was a really gifted
orator. Um, and in March, uh,

403
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:13,670
1893 fortunate gave a speech,
uh,

404
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:18,080
at this one place where they met over
and over again denouncing the government

405
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,480
class, uh, and the bourgeoisie.

406
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:24,260
And he appeared to pull a
dynamite cartridge from, he said,

407
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:29,240
this is our arms. These are our arms and
appear, deploy, pull a dynamite cartridge,

408
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,470
uh, from his pocket. Uh,

409
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:35,600
it actually was nothing
but a pen or a pen case.

410
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,440
But he was arrested and so was a mean.
Uh,

411
00:26:39,441 --> 00:26:44,240
and m immediately lost his job.
Uh, at that point he worked in,

412
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,390
in the garment industry.
I love this cause here's the,

413
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:51,370
the root of a song ta in the center
of Paris. And that's still, you know,

414
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,900
the finest, so beautiful from the
1890s that they left it there.

415
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:57,350
That company hasn't been
there since World War One. Uh,

416
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,220
but that's where
immediately, uh, uh, worked.

417
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:04,620
But he lost his job after he was
arrested and then, and then released.

418
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,090
He bounced between, um, uh,

419
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:11,091
between bad jobs once working
as an apprentice and unpaid
watchmaker in order to

420
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:15,780
perhaps work on timing
mechanisms, uh, for, uh,

421
00:27:15,781 --> 00:27:20,170
for bombs in 1892.
And he always got very good employers,

422
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,370
loved him because he was very smart. He
was, he served as a, as an accountant.

423
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,210
He penned letters and that
kind of stuff. Um, but in 1882,

424
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:31,110
he briefly served as the manager
for the anarchist literary, uh,

425
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:36,120
a newspaper. Uh, in the meantime, he
was gathering materials to make bombs.

426
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:39,150
And learning how to
prepare them that July,

427
00:27:39,151 --> 00:27:44,151
he and he and his brother may have gone
to Santa tn and mom result with the

428
00:27:45,091 --> 00:27:50,091
intention of blowing up the house of the
magistrate in Robichaud is trial down

429
00:27:50,341 --> 00:27:54,090
there. But, and I, I went to
Santa and to try to, uh, you know,

430
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:56,280
find that if he actually went
there and the police think he did,

431
00:27:56,281 --> 00:28:01,170
but I have no positive proof
of that. Um, anyway, he, um,

432
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,050
he, uh, the police informants
and the police were everywhere.

433
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:05,620
If you want to see this,
it'll,

434
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:09,330
Joseph Conrad has a wonderful
novel called the secret agent. Uh,

435
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,260
and GK Chesterton has another one called
a man who would be Thursday in which

436
00:28:13,261 --> 00:28:17,130
all seven anarchist in this antithesis
anarchist group turned out to be policed

437
00:28:17,131 --> 00:28:20,910
spies. And Lennon was just riddled
with police spies, uh, you know,

438
00:28:20,911 --> 00:28:25,911
watching the Dutch and Spanish and French
and Russian and Czech anarchists and

439
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:29,400
all the others. But anyway, uh,
he was overheard telling somebody,

440
00:28:29,401 --> 00:28:33,180
I didn't put enough nitroglycerin
into this one, uh, and it didn't work,

441
00:28:33,181 --> 00:28:36,120
but I'm gonna put a little more acid
next time and we'll see what happens.

442
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,290
And the police report,

443
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:41,910
which I've seen assigned him
to the number 318,532, uh,

444
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:46,320
and so he had a police existence,
which was good for, uh, uh, for me.

445
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:51,090
Um, the police, as I said, it
infiltrated these groups. Uh,

446
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,980
one of the, the, uh, the,

447
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:57,981
the police spies who is known as x number
for a reported that the old ways of

448
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:04,041
the anarchist no longer seem to
be in play that were anarchists,

449
00:29:05,671 --> 00:29:10,320
hadn't used to go to these big halls
where the police were scribbling notes and

450
00:29:10,321 --> 00:29:13,530
identifying everybody was there.
That the ones who had to worry about,

451
00:29:13,531 --> 00:29:16,650
we're not the ones who were
in the hall giving speeches,

452
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:21,590
but as the one who are looking in the
shadows looking for other people with, uh,

453
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,850
you know, with evil
deeds, uh, as it were, uh,

454
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,540
in mine, they were the ones who
would show up and then leave quickly.

455
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:34,560
These were the most violent and one is
the ones who are capable of carrying out

456
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:38,790
propaganda by, uh, the deeds. Uh,

457
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:43,480
they were not the ob,
the posers, um, or, uh,

458
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,200
the boasters,
uh,

459
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:50,220
they were off by themselves and they
reflected a debate with an anarchist

460
00:29:50,411 --> 00:29:55,300
circles between the association analysts
who had ended up being cynical lists

461
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,600
and those who believed in the individual
autonomy in individual autonomy that

462
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:05,320
the single anarchist making
his decision to go out and,

463
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,030
and kill individual autonomy.
And thus,

464
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:14,380
you know, I use the, the uh,
the description of, of, of,

465
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:18,070
of this lecture for better
for worse as dynamite club,

466
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:23,440
but dynamite club was the
perception of our, not the police,

467
00:30:23,441 --> 00:30:27,100
cause they knew better, but of the
public that imagined that, that,

468
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:29,350
that behind every incident,

469
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:34,650
every sardine can was in there for various
plot to destroy organized a society.

470
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,140
There was no club,

471
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:43,270
but there were some violent individuals
capable of minorities within anarchist

472
00:30:43,271 --> 00:30:47,440
movement of doing deeds on the 11th,

473
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:51,790
backing up one year for reasons we'll
see. The 11th of November, 1892,

474
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:56,140
an employee of this, uh, of
the mine company of cow Mo,

475
00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:01,510
those mining strikes that John
had catapulted jr has to fame, um,

476
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,250
found a suspicious looking package on
the floor outside the company door at 11

477
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:10,570
avenue. Uh, Dillup. Aha,
they're 11 up on the left.

478
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,950
This is 1900. This picture I've gotten
into that building to my son and I did,

479
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,550
I would showed him where that he put the
bomb. It's still a very elegant, uh, uh,

480
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,930
uh, elegant building. Um, and
they carried it downstairs,

481
00:31:22,931 --> 00:31:26,740
rather stupidly, place it on the
sidewalk. It's a back entrance.

482
00:31:26,741 --> 00:31:28,240
And a policeman came along and said,
well,

483
00:31:28,241 --> 00:31:29,830
you better take it to the police station.

484
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:34,750
I'm not noticing that there were a little
powder that seem to be coming out of

485
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:39,700
this, uh, uh, this, uh, machine is, they
used to call them in those days. Um,

486
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:44,910
it was a reversible bomb.
It was a bomb not made by a fuse,

487
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:48,010
but by chemicals. And when they came
together with blow up. And so these,

488
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:51,610
these poor policemen are carrying
it to the nearest police station,

489
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,780
which is there, no, that's the f the
building now. Uh, you can get into,

490
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:58,690
it's on the first floor. I love
stuff like that. I just love it.

491
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,300
That's the police station,
which is still there also.

492
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:05,830
And so they carry it into the, through
the course first courtyard. One guy says,

493
00:32:05,831 --> 00:32:10,710
hurry up, it's heavy. I was a heavy thing.
They put it in, put it down on the table.

494
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,860
Boom. Arms, legs everywhere. Gone.

495
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,650
Five people killed in
the most horrible way.

496
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,460
The bomb had been wrapped in a newspaper.
Uh,

497
00:32:21,461 --> 00:32:26,440
the issue of Luton from June 1st,

498
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,440
1892 which related the story of the arrest
of a meet Ari and his brother and me.

499
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,320
Then when we left Paris the next day
for London, sending along his apologies,

500
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:43,430
he was a list on a list of 130 suspects.
He hangs around Fitzroy Square,

501
00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:48,020
which now is so expensive. So Charlotte
Street just full of one fancy,

502
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,480
uh,
an affordable restaurant after another.

503
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,600
He hangs around with the anarchists there.
Um,

504
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,480
a friend of Oscar Wilde's
remembered meeting him there.

505
00:32:56,481 --> 00:33:00,590
He spoke some English but not
terribly well once he told people,

506
00:33:00,591 --> 00:33:05,090
today is the anniversary of the dancing
lesson by which he meant bodies jumping

507
00:33:05,091 --> 00:33:09,050
up and down in their
last final agony, uh, in,

508
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:13,460
in the police station. He was proud
he had exterminated six enemies.

509
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,710
Mulatto said he grew in his own eyes.

510
00:33:15,711 --> 00:33:20,711
He said to himself that his role as
a destroying angel had just begun.

511
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,880
But why didn't they think he
was a serious suspect? Well,

512
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,660
because the policemen that particular day,

513
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:35,090
that day in November eight, 1892,
he'd gone to work near the Gal,

514
00:33:35,091 --> 00:33:38,360
do know the station of the north.
He had two errands to do.

515
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,670
One was near the Church of the Madeline,

516
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:44,420
the second with way up by
near the Arc de Triomphe,

517
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:50,290
his boss gave him some money to do these
errands and policemen tried to do the

518
00:33:50,991 --> 00:33:55,991
same thing and said that he could not
have gone back to his house in Moscow to

519
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:59,870
the fifth floor roof at home. It
doesn't matter. I love this stuff.

520
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:04,150
And got the bomb gone all the way
back down to the avenue local Aha.

521
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,130
And then finished his errands and got
back in two hours and 15 minutes pop. Oh.

522
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,760
So I did it.

523
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:15,050
I replaced a tram way and
only booths with, you know,

524
00:34:15,051 --> 00:34:18,260
buses and Metros.
And I replaced a carriage.

525
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,690
I never take cabs with a cab and my cab
couldn't turn left on the avenue loop

526
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,120
high. So I subtracted
11 minutes. I paused,

527
00:34:26,121 --> 00:34:30,530
I couldn't get that day into the one of
his houses where we put the bomb. Um,

528
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,620
and I came back in about two
hours and 15 or 16 minutes.

529
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:39,250
Somebody did the same thing in 1894 and
said he certainly could have done it

530
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:45,290
anywhere anyway.
Old immediately is off in London now.

531
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,430
Um, let, I'm just trying to now
to imagine what he imagined,

532
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:54,530
what converts them to anarchism was the
appalling a gap between the wealthy and

533
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,560
the poor in Paris and other places.
Uh, the heritage of his father, uh,

534
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,490
of course with some,
had something to do with it.

535
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:05,090
Never had people lived it
up and such flamboyant, uh,

536
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:08,660
want to get even say egregious
ways, uh, as in Paris,

537
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,590
in the belly book,
the so called gay nineties.

538
00:35:12,591 --> 00:35:14,720
Now that the nostalgia for that is,

539
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:18,830
is a creation really of how horrible
things would be later with world war one.

540
00:35:18,831 --> 00:35:22,490
But, but still the, the belly pope
was not bell for very many people,

541
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,640
but what leads him to anarchism is,
uh,

542
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,880
is that everywhere he lived.
And that was the only place,

543
00:35:28,881 --> 00:35:29,810
the exception in a minute ago,

544
00:35:29,811 --> 00:35:33,530
which was near the busty everywhere
he lived was on the edge of Paris.

545
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,760
And everywhere he lived,

546
00:35:34,761 --> 00:35:39,290
the facades of the buildings are still
the same is one that's near a Momar.

547
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,600
Ah,
and they're building sock recur.

548
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:47,330
This is from that same time the hadn't
been completed yet, but it's, it,

549
00:35:47,331 --> 00:35:51,690
it's big bell drowning out.
The whole city hadn't been put in there,

550
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,930
but this soccer career was built where,
uh,

551
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,430
where the commune had been,
had started and it was a,

552
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,760
it was seen as a monument of penance
for the government of the moral order.

553
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:07,000
And so that they hated this and
they refer constantly to this. Uh,

554
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:10,350
they have fantasies a as all,
I wrote a novel called Paris,

555
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,880
but he in 1898 a,
which is modeled after a meal,

556
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:16,380
Henri and some of these other people.
And,

557
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,570
and the brother of this
priest who liked it, you know,

558
00:36:18,571 --> 00:36:21,210
rem record is losing his religion.

559
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,300
He has these fantasies about blowing up,

560
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:29,340
sock recur and Emilio and relived near
there, he lived in the Ruby at home,

561
00:36:29,341 --> 00:36:31,740
which is now fairly sheikh.
He live in the top floor up there.

562
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:36,570
That's where he went to get the bomb. And
then he moves into this place. It says,

563
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:41,520
Vila full share hasn't flow for sure.
And that's not fancy at all. Uh, but,

564
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:44,870
and this is the same facade. He
lived on the inside there, uh,

565
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,600
in 1894 and I went up there cause I, you
know, I gotta see, I gotta, I gotta See,

566
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:53,140
and this is a pretty, uh,
a sketchy neighborhood and
there are a lot of d there,

567
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,690
a drug deals going on here. And I didn't
want to look like, uh, uh, seek on CV.

568
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:00,660
You know, I'm a plainclothes
cop and I don't want it to last.

569
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:04,440
I don't wanna look like a wealthy
tourist either. And so, you know,

570
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:08,070
I kind of hid behind the truck and
took pictures and I walked in and said

571
00:37:08,071 --> 00:37:12,330
something like, so seller Liga and
uh, you know, every day I had to see,

572
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,780
but when you walk out of this,
that's how you got in.

573
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,920
That's 1894.
When you walk out of this,

574
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,510
you turn right and there is the park of,
of,

575
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:26,570
of bevy and down below
the plus lateral cat,

576
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,130
when he would lose his
head and he looked out,

577
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:33,000
he was lucky he couldn't see the tour
Montparnasse uh, which didn't even exist,

578
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,830
but he could see symbols that he hated.

579
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,800
There was a tool he fell that had
only been there for the Eiffel Tower,

580
00:37:37,801 --> 00:37:38,910
been there for five years.

581
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:43,530
There was the Ponti on where that the
State is commemorated its heroes and there

582
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:46,140
was no true dom,
which he hated as well.

583
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:51,470
And so he once wrote that
love can lead you to hate.

584
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,370
He wrote that before.
He's gay teens and he hated,

585
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,660
he loved humanity in the abstract.
He loved his mom too.

586
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:06,690
But he, he loved humanity and he
hated the state. And so he sent out,

587
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,910
he set out to kill. So these are, uh,

588
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:13,920
these are sort of visual signifiers,
I guess in the new cultural history.

589
00:38:13,921 --> 00:38:17,610
They would call them these buildings
upon which are these monuments that he

590
00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:22,430
looked down, uh, and uh, and
hated. If you've read, uh,

591
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,120
Balzac's old Gfi,
oh,

592
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,600
ever in your reading career that
at the very end of the story,

593
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:31,980
Rosti neck is up at perilous as cemetery.
And in the poor parallel,

594
00:38:31,981 --> 00:38:34,200
she has not poor but,
but the area around it is,

595
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:37,480
and he gestures down to western Paris,
the fancy Paris,

596
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,540
and he says the equivalent of its
war between you and me. Now Baby.

597
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:45,040
But he wanted to make the big time.
He wanted to sleep with the right people.

598
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:49,330
He wanted to,
to just do better and better for himself.

599
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:52,480
Immediate already says that, points down
in those neighborhoods. And he says,

600
00:38:52,481 --> 00:38:57,130
this war between you and me now baby.
And he meant it and he built bombs.

601
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:00,530
And he went out to,
uh,

602
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,620
to kill a,

603
00:39:02,621 --> 00:39:07,621
at a time when anarchist deeds
were being celebrated by some,

604
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:12,820
uh, anarchists. The explosive device
that he threw into the cafe. Termi News.

605
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:16,330
February, uh, 1894, hit a chandelier,

606
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,930
then a marble table and fell
to the ground, exploding.

607
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:24,010
20 people were wounded of
whom won. The, uh, later died,

608
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:28,780
broken glass paces of pieces of, of tables
and chairs, blood and injured people.

609
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,450
Fear was everywhere.
Uh,

610
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,900
and our architect had five wounds,
a draftsman,

611
00:39:34,901 --> 00:39:39,280
17 Ari had seen,
I had been seen.

612
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:44,260
He did after all sip just his second
beer first also. Uh, and at one point,

613
00:39:44,261 --> 00:39:49,000
not, not, so he wouldn't be caught. Let's,
so we can rule out indirect suicide,

614
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,730
uh, which I'll talk about just
briefly in a minute. He said, Oh,

615
00:39:51,731 --> 00:39:55,840
where's the scoundrel that
did this, uh, and runs away.

616
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,550
And he's chased by policemen,
by an apprentice barber, by, uh,

617
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,710
a controller from the,
from, uh, the trauma way.

618
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,690
And they finally catch him,
uh, around the corner from, uh,

619
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,570
from the Garth's, none
of those are, and the,

620
00:40:09,571 --> 00:40:13,240
and he fires point blank with his pistol.
He also had his knife,

621
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:16,650
had that poison on it as well. Uh, uh,

622
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:21,510
one policeman called [inaudible], uh,
is, was very lucky to have escaped, uh,

623
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:26,620
uh, with his life because his big
wallet with was hit by, uh, by one of,

624
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,910
of these shots.

625
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,140
And so he's put in prison
here in the Cosia Gov,

626
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,980
and that cell no longer exists that he
was in now don tall and Robespierre and

627
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:42,880
Marie Antoinette and, and, uh, Louis
the 16th, we're also in this prison.

628
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:45,940
And one of the great sources
about this guy's life was, uh,

629
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,820
the prison guards because they're trying
to get information out of him and he

630
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:52,420
tries to convert them to anarchism. And,
and you know, they have very interesting,

631
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:56,980
uh, kind of, uh, of relationship.
Um, the first night he was in prison,

632
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:01,620
a friends of his broke into his
room and took out enough, uh,

633
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,930
dynamite to make 14 or 15 other bombs.

634
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:09,760
And so Paris is to say the
least on a high alert. Um,

635
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:14,260
and so, um, on the, uh, is,

636
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:19,090
was put on a trial, uh, and in, uh,

637
00:41:19,091 --> 00:41:21,760
flourish. Uh, he, uh,

638
00:41:21,761 --> 00:41:26,710
I saluted anarchism and gave a
declaration, a four anarchism, uh,

639
00:41:26,711 --> 00:41:31,390
that, uh, was red. Uh, and
it's still red, uh, today.

640
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:35,390
Um, where he says, you have Gary to
deaths in Spain. You have a hung us,

641
00:41:35,391 --> 00:41:39,800
and in Germany you have shot us,
uh, here and there you have, uh, uh,

642
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:43,370
you let you have a,
a guillotine destined France.

643
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:48,320
But what you can never do as extinguished
and are key because it's, uh,

644
00:41:48,321 --> 00:41:52,730
it's, um, it's roots are too deep.

645
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:57,500
Uh, not surprisingly, he was
condemned to, uh, to be executed.

646
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:02,630
Um, and that he was on
the 21st of May, 1894,

647
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:07,550
uh, and an early morning at
4:00 AM four in the morning.

648
00:42:07,551 --> 00:42:08,270
And the,
the,

649
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:12,000
the executioners all come from the same
family in this guy called [inaudible]

650
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:16,290
was, it was the execution. I got to
go back to that woman in a minute. Um,

651
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:21,430
this is DBA who was called Mr [inaudible],
who was the chief executioner.

652
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,040
And for him, one where execution was
just, you know, just one more execution.

653
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:30,080
The last public execution and France
was 1936. The last execution in France,

654
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:30,471
uh,

655
00:42:30,471 --> 00:42:35,471
using a gay teen of course
come WTF was 1972 or 1973,

656
00:42:36,111 --> 00:42:38,840
I can't remember what date.
And you know,

657
00:42:38,841 --> 00:42:43,150
in the chill of that morning where
people paid for paid for, uh, uh,

658
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,630
seats on the roof.
And there were,

659
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:48,830
there were little children whose parents
bought them seats as if they were on

660
00:42:48,831 --> 00:42:52,070
the roof as if you're outside Wrigley
field in watching the cubs from a,

661
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:54,980
from a roof far away, uh, uh,

662
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,010
executions were festive
events for those people.

663
00:42:58,011 --> 00:43:02,450
Also finishing there other nights.
And there was always sort of, uh,

664
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,170
uh, uh, some speculation about
when this is going to happen,

665
00:43:06,171 --> 00:43:07,880
when is he finally going to be executed?

666
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,490
And the scene which I've tried
to recreate in this book of,

667
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:14,630
of deep layer of the wagons with
the wood of justice showing up and,

668
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:19,630
and with the apprentices doing their
work and putting up this guillotine, uh,

669
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,170
as if you're putting together this,

670
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:26,570
this basically perfect toy that didn't
need any nails because everything fit

671
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:29,000
together so well. Uh,
you know, they're really,

672
00:43:29,001 --> 00:43:32,630
this guillotine scenes were so important
for anarchist also because it's part of

673
00:43:32,631 --> 00:43:36,140
the idea of martyrdom,
a revolutionary immortality.

674
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,350
And now this comes from a Christian
religion also, doesn't it?

675
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,750
The execution scenes. Uh, you
know, I, again, I mean, I, you, I,

676
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:46,580
you see what I'm saying in
that, but, but, but the,

677
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,760
the scenes of the martyrdom and the use
that anarchist put to this are still,

678
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,930
uh, uh, are still rather, um,
rather important. Now, uh,

679
00:43:56,931 --> 00:43:59,630
was this a form of indirect suicide?

680
00:43:59,631 --> 00:44:03,320
He'd fall in love with the wife of an
anarchist and her building is still there

681
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:07,010
too, ironically, not far away from
the place where he was executed.

682
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:12,370
And he hit on her and they would go out
with the husband to his obash and he per

683
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,990
word reclaim as love and, and
she kind of blew them off. Um,

684
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,430
it was an indirect suicide.
No,

685
00:44:19,431 --> 00:44:23,360
obviously not because he tries to escape
at the end and then she tell you no.

686
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:25,460
And real anticipation of the modern life,

687
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:30,590
she is out giving interviews to the
journalists after his execution. Uh,

688
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:34,380
she's saying, oh, he loved me so much
and, and, and one can well understand why.

689
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,790
You know, I, the whole thing was
just, just, uh, incredible though,

690
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:42,780
but it was not any kind of indirect,
a suicide at all.

691
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:47,580
But what do I mean about the origins of
modern terrorism? What was new about it?

692
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:52,400
Well, a couple things. Rava Shul vial,

693
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:58,140
we're very poor. Robert Shaw was a
pullover tip, a sad sack. Viola was not,

694
00:44:58,141 --> 00:45:02,910
he was very honorable person.
Most of the people in Western Europe,

695
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:07,170
there are some exceptions in, in, in the
Russian case, but these were an anarchist.

696
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:11,700
It's a group called Neuro Novo
People's will. Um, we're, uh,

697
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:14,520
we're ordinary workers and me,
don't worry with an intellectual,

698
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:18,060
he was an intellectual.
That's new.

699
00:45:18,061 --> 00:45:19,890
But that's not as important
as what else was new.

700
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:24,600
Instead of targeting a head
of state or a uniform person,

701
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,900
as other anarchists had done,
he just picked people who
were having a beer, petty,

702
00:45:30,901 --> 00:45:31,351
bourgeois,

703
00:45:31,351 --> 00:45:35,310
the hated because they propped up
capitalism and through the bomb at them

704
00:45:35,311 --> 00:45:38,550
knowing he was gonna kill a lot of them,
he sat there and looked at them.

705
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:42,070
There's a very amazing scene in battle
of Algiers and the movie metal jurists

706
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:45,000
where this woman's going to place a bomb
and she's looking at people that are

707
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:48,390
going to die because of
what she is doing there.

708
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:53,220
And he looked at these people and
he said, uh, I'm gonna kill you.

709
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:57,840
I'm going to kill you because I love,
I hate.

710
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,940
And that's really new about it.

711
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:05,450
Is it worth at all musing
about what this has to do with,

712
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:10,860
uh, with, uh, modern
terrorism? I don't know,

713
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:14,930
just a, a few, uh, uh, reflections. Uh,

714
00:46:14,931 --> 00:46:18,930
there is no doubt about that, that
there are some connections. If you take,

715
00:46:18,931 --> 00:46:20,520
you know, a psalm of
enlightened, for example,

716
00:46:20,521 --> 00:46:24,030
he announced for it as everybody knows
and the late nineties that he'll attack

717
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:28,440
civilians, American civil billions,
just like American military people.

718
00:46:28,441 --> 00:46:32,310
That's perfectly obvious.
Um, that, uh, another, uh,

719
00:46:32,311 --> 00:46:35,350
another connection is within modern
terrorism. I mean, you have this,

720
00:46:35,351 --> 00:46:39,240
the of alliance between intellectuals,
students and, and, and, uh, uh,

721
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,230
people who are simply a down and out.
I mean, there are big differences also.

722
00:46:43,231 --> 00:46:46,420
I mean the suicide bombers is something,
you know, it's very different but,

723
00:46:46,421 --> 00:46:49,830
but still there are things that are,
we're thinking about third. And you know,

724
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:53,580
there's the whole idea of revolutionary
in mortality that you kill people.

725
00:46:53,581 --> 00:46:56,670
You die and you have
revolutionary immortality. Uh,

726
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,310
for many a fundamentalist
terrorist you pass into,

727
00:46:59,311 --> 00:47:03,230
into this immediately into
this nirvana fourth, uh,

728
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:05,610
both set of terrorist target,
a powerful enemy,

729
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:10,980
a structure they set out to destroy a
tariff and tried to kill one warrant,

730
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:15,210
a thousand goes in old Chinese, uh, uh,

731
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:19,110
a proper and they want to
tack the state and capitalism.

732
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:22,740
I in the case of the anarchists and the
targets are perfectly obvious in the

733
00:47:22,741 --> 00:47:26,670
case of uh, uh, of contemporary
terrorists as well.

734
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:32,030
Sif dynamite like bombs are seen
as leveling the playing field.

735
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:38,290
You attack, you can prove that you are
strong. When in reality you are our weak.

736
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:42,100
They demonstrate the powerful states
are vulnerable even to small groups of

737
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:45,580
determine, uh, determined,
uh, uh, anarchists.

738
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,280
Next also these groups,
as I said,

739
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:52,750
their tendency is always to try to
find one person running the whole show.

740
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:56,110
It's absolutely not the case in the case
of the anarchist, as I already said,

741
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:59,050
nor is it the case now, uh, as well.

742
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,590
So the French government then and
officials now have a tendency to look for

743
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:05,440
centrally organized,
massive conspiracy and salvage,

744
00:48:05,441 --> 00:48:10,390
acknowledging this role of small groups
or even isolated individuals undertaking

745
00:48:10,391 --> 00:48:13,180
locally organized or freelance, uh, uh,

746
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:18,181
operations and our kids to repeat always
emphasize the full autonomy of the

747
00:48:18,191 --> 00:48:23,050
individual. Indeed the potential and
murderous individual as the case,

748
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:25,530
as I've said, and you
know, I obviously, uh, uh,

749
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:28,600
to test everything that the
medial Henri, uh, stood for,

750
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:32,240
but I've tried to
understand his, his, um, uh,

751
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:35,550
hatred yet.
There's one more other,

752
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:38,530
there's one more thing
that could be added to,

753
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,630
is that when you think
of the word terrorism,

754
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:45,990
the word terrorism was originally
applied to actions taken by the state to

755
00:48:46,691 --> 00:48:47,590
terrorize.

756
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:52,540
The terror was terrorizing
opponents in the French revolution.

757
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:58,020
And it's often forgotten that the vast
majority of victims of terror are victims

758
00:48:59,141 --> 00:49:00,220
of state terrorism.

759
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:04,930
And the anarchist hated the state
because they'd seen up close what state

760
00:49:04,931 --> 00:49:09,770
terrorism did in the wake of the Commun.
And the beating up of the police, uh,

761
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:13,480
clichy, uh, the massacre of
the innocence of these women,

762
00:49:13,481 --> 00:49:15,290
young women gunned down,
uh,

763
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:20,550
during the strike in the north or man
demonstration in the north in 1891,

764
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,120
uh, must be remembered, uh, during
the 1890s, anarchists attacks,

765
00:49:25,121 --> 00:49:29,500
which were terrible, killed a maximum
of 60 people. Tragic wounding more than,

766
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:34,600
than 200. But if you look at non,
if you look at state terrorism, uh,

767
00:49:34,601 --> 00:49:39,550
the ratio of somebody has figured
out stands at approximately 262, one,

768
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:44,940
260 victims of state terrorism as opposed
to one victim of this horrible thing.

769
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,970
Terrorism has become part
of the political process,

770
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,740
what has been called a adults
macabre or sort of macabre dance, uh,

771
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:57,400
uh, between states and
their fiercest opponents.

772
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:00,310
The two interact dynamically
and need each other.

773
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:04,870
The hatred of dissidents is only foot
further stoke by the overreaction of

774
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:09,820
authorities. Uh, it's simply,
uh, uh, encourages attacks.

775
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:12,700
And certainly this is not, of course I'm
political science, but there are over.

776
00:50:12,701 --> 00:50:17,140
But the reaction of the United
States government and other
governments, uh, to, uh,

777
00:50:17,141 --> 00:50:17,891
the,
the horrible,

778
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:22,720
horrible tax and September 11th
are a pretty good example of that.

779
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:26,110
When, uh, when states take tactics,

780
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:30,890
swell the hatred of their opponents
by, uh, by abusing prisoners,

781
00:50:30,891 --> 00:50:33,860
by torturing prisoners and
by that sort of thing. Uh,

782
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,960
that line between that goes all the
way back to two Spain of the 1890,

783
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:42,290
the first decade of the 20th century, back
to the Paris commune before that. And,

784
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:46,070
uh,
unfortunately to are very day.

785
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:49,700
That is a story of [inaudible]
see you on Wednesday.
