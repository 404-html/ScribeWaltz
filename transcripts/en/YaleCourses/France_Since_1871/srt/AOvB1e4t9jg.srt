1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:02,220
Let's go.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:02,311
Oh,

3
00:00:02,311 --> 00:00:03,001
Charles rocks.

4
00:00:03,001 --> 00:00:03,930
Wasn't that good the other day.

5
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,690
Charles Keith,

6
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:05,523
you liked that lecture?

7
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:06,511
He's very,

8
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:06,991
he's excellent.

9
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:08,700
He did a seminar on an imperialism,

10
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:09,331
uh,

11
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:09,751
last year,

12
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:10,470
which is very good.

13
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,490
Before I start,

14
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,600
I just wanted to,

15
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:13,090
uh,

16
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:13,450
just,

17
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:13,740
just,

18
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:13,921
just,

19
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:14,100
just,

20
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,030
just to give you,

21
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:15,610
uh,

22
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,000
uh,

23
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,191
you know,

24
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:18,180
a visual idea of,

25
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,043
um,

26
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,250
of the new imperialism that is the
period he was talking about from the mid

27
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:24,360
1880s,

28
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,920
let's say 1884,

29
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:27,630
1885 to 1914.

30
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:32,130
So what to focus on is just when you're
looking at this thing is there's Africa.

31
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,331
Okay.

32
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:34,021
There's Africa.

33
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:34,860
So you've got a few little,

34
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:35,690
you know,

35
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,200
a few little splotches.

36
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,250
And they weren't even,

37
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,430
they weren't even maps so much
of the internal part of Africa.

38
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:41,681
So that,

39
00:00:41,681 --> 00:00:42,990
that's 1880.

40
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,430
And I'll look at this.

41
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,700
That's 1914.

42
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,730
So something has happened in between,

43
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,880
which is that the scramble for colonies
has literally eaten up the entire

44
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,653
continent.

45
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,381
Uh,

46
00:00:58,381 --> 00:00:59,540
and the places that,

47
00:00:59,541 --> 00:00:59,971
that,

48
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:00,580
uh,

49
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:00,990
you know,

50
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,020
th the Charles were talking
about was obviously west Africa,

51
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:04,801
basically here,

52
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:07,980
west Africa and now Mali and Senegal.

53
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:08,141
And,

54
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:08,671
and you know,

55
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:09,121
Algeria,

56
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:10,240
obviously Morocco and,

57
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:10,531
and,

58
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:11,280
uh,

59
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,090
um,

60
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:12,923
uh,

61
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:13,441
uh,

62
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:13,621
you know,

63
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:14,580
Indonesia and,

64
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,541
and that sort of thing.

65
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:16,680
And then the rest you just see,

66
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,280
uh,

67
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,581
but that,

68
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:17,780
that,

69
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,750
but it's an extraordinary,

70
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,221
extraordinary,

71
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:21,030
uh,

72
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,863
um,

73
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,670
contrast in there.

74
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:25,970
And there's flush Shota which
is where the [inaudible] the,

75
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,120
the two,

76
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,940
a Expeditionary Force stumble
into each other and there,

77
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,290
and there was a thought of,

78
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:31,800
of,

79
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,880
of war and,

80
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,580
uh,

81
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:33,810
uh,

82
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,430
they settled it there with a few drinks,

83
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:35,941
but then,

84
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:36,061
uh,

85
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:36,894
that the,

86
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:37,410
uh,

87
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,240
foreign ministers go wild.

88
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:40,010
And it's a,

89
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:40,843
it's all that.

90
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:41,963
Uh,

91
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,730
so just to remind you of the context.

92
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:45,870
So that's what I'm going
to talk about today.

93
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:46,950
I don't know if are you recording yet,

94
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:47,101
but,

95
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:47,341
but,

96
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:47,850
uh,

97
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,180
we can.

98
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:48,450
Yup.

99
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,283
Okay.

100
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,250
Um,

101
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,090
so just to put this in context of,

102
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:54,961
you know,

103
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:57,420
the diplomatic origins of,

104
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:57,920
uh,

105
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,030
of world war one,

106
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,571
because I mean,

107
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:03,180
the traditional image of
all this isn't a bad one.

108
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:04,860
It's the entangling alliances,

109
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,830
uh,

110
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,070
that create this kind of house of cards,

111
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:08,651
uh,

112
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:11,130
that when a war Br,

113
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,180
if first breaks out a or for that
matter when the Russian empire declares

114
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:18,990
mobilization of its armies,

115
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,601
uh,

116
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:21,750
that the house of cards will collapse.

117
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,410
And,

118
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:22,591
uh,

119
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:24,840
the great powers minus,

120
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,151
uh,

121
00:02:25,151 --> 00:02:25,651
Italy,

122
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:28,320
which we'll wait for the
highest bidder in 1915,

123
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,160
uh,

124
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,030
go to war.

125
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,020
So how did this,

126
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:31,310
I mean,

127
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:31,500
how,

128
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,980
how does this all happen
briefly in 45 minutes?

129
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:35,814
How does this happen?

130
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,043
Um,

131
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,431
first of all,

132
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:39,340
I mean the old and,

133
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:39,441
and,

134
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:39,601
and,

135
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:40,750
and towards the end of the,

136
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,461
of the hour,

137
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,930
I'll have towards the
end of the 45 minutes,

138
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:44,970
I'll talk a little bit about one specific,

139
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,460
uh,

140
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,820
affair that kind of demonstrates the,

141
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,330
uh,

142
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,440
the intensity of what,

143
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:50,460
what had happened.

144
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,040
Uh,

145
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,361
and,

146
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:51,640
and,

147
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,620
and the shift of from away from England
being perceived as is arguably Francis

148
00:02:55,621 --> 00:03:00,621
greatest enemy despite SSRN to that of
Germany and the dissolver and affairs is

149
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:01,680

N.

162
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:08,980
Um,

163
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,341
but,

164
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:10,180
but of course,

165
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,223
lots of,

166
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,640
lots of the diplomatic,

167
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:12,911
you know,

168
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:13,411
history of,

169
00:03:13,411 --> 00:03:14,620
of this period.

170
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,610
Um,

171
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,390
uh,

172
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,350
and at first revolves around the
MTT between France and Germany.

173
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:23,110
And specifically as you've
heard over and over again,

174
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:23,940
uh,

175
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,930
Alsace a law man.

176
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:26,860
Um,

177
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,281
and,

178
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:27,341
uh,

179
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:27,521
you know,

180
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:28,540
one can debate,

181
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:28,741
uh,

182
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:32,440
as historians have to what extent revenge,

183
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,400
uh,

184
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,390
permeated,

185
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,770
uh,

186
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,780
the ranks of French society,

187
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:39,430
thoughts of taking back Ssrn,

188
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:39,970
uh,

189
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,200
through the whole period.

190
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:42,400
And as I said a few minutes ago,

191
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,030
if you'd ask people in 1890s,

192
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,900
who France would go to war against,

193
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:47,241
uh,

194
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:47,591
you know,

195
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:49,390
if they had poles in those days,

196
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:52,120
most people would've said Britain
more about that in a while.

197
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:52,810
Uh,

198
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,280
but it was always there.

199
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,530
It was always there for Otto von Bismarck,

200
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,190
uh,

201
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,220
as he's trying to assure that,

202
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:00,670
that,

203
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,090
uh,

204
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,710
if Germany does go to war,

205
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:04,870
it won't have to fight
his worst nightmare.

206
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:07,360
That is a war on two fronts.

207
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:12,460
And that's exactly what happens
when the French and the Russians,

208
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,121
uh,

209
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:14,260
a get together.

210
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,220
Um,

211
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,190
and so I mean that,

212
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:17,731
that's the,

213
00:04:17,731 --> 00:04:20,980
that's a major issue in,

214
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,900
in western Europe is obviously
the relationship between
these folks and El Sauce

215
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:27,220
and the parts of Lauryn,

216
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:27,670
uh,

217
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,250
that had been a next into,

218
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:30,910
uh,

219
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,691
the German empire.

220
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:32,411
And next rather,

221
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:37,411
and comfortably as we'll see a in a while
and the other may I just have to dodge

222
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:38,380
these peripherally.

223
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:38,800
Uh,

224
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,071
but,

225
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,660
but it's important to
at least you and you,

226
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:42,040
I'm sure you know about them anyway.

227
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:42,550
But,

228
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:42,970
uh,

229
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:43,211
you know,

230
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:46,300
the other thing that is
going to hinge on is the,

231
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,170
uh,

232
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,680
really the hatred between Russia and,

233
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,621
and Austria,

234
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:51,454
Hungary.

235
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:51,880
Um,

236
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,211
and,

237
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:53,140
and the fact that,

238
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:56,200
that the Russians see themselves
as the protector of the,

239
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,970
of the Slavic peoples,

240
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:58,660
uh,

241
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,051
in,

242
00:04:59,051 --> 00:04:59,321
in,

243
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:00,520
in the Balkans.

244
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,720
And the fact that the Austrian
Hungarian empire is a polyglot empire.

245
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,111
That is,

246
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:06,310
you've got at least,

247
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:07,390
depending on how you count them,

248
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:10,360
15 major nationalities when the empire,

249
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,141
uh,

250
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:11,974
and that,

251
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,371
uh,

252
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:13,150
although,

253
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:13,540
uh,

254
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,170
Germany,

255
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,010
German is the language of,

256
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,620
of the Empire that Austria,

257
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:18,400
Hungary,

258
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:18,700
uh,

259
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,290
these ethnic minorities and their
claims for national independence,

260
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:23,890
uh,

261
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,000
exists as a,

262
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:29,890
as a perpetual destabilizing factor
in Austrian Hungarian politics,

263
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,510
particularly when Russia,

264
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,630
which is always dreamt of Constantinople
and controlling the access to the Black

265
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,820
Sea is fanning the flames of,

266
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,320
of nationalism,

267
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,363
of Slavic,

268
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:42,930
uh,

269
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,460
of Pan Slava Islam,

270
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,700
but also of nationalism
within these various states,

271
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,530
which destabilizes,

272
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,050
uh,

273
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,460
uh,

274
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,480
potentially the Austro-hungarian Empire
and the Austrian Hungarian Empire became

275
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:58,040
the dual monarchy before
this course starts.

276
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,873
But in 18,

277
00:05:58,970 --> 00:05:59,420
I,

278
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,290
67,

279
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,030
it's run out of Vienna,

280
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:05,900
which is that city which has left by
the treaty of Versailles and the other

281
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:06,734
treaties,

282
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,270
uh,

283
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,400
uh,

284
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,260
after war one is this enormous,

285
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:10,130
the capital,

286
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:10,600
uh,

287
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,330
uh,

288
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:16,070
of a tiny country when the
empire empire disappears.

289
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:16,401
A,

290
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:17,234
but that is,

291
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:17,740
uh,

292
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,050
uh,

293
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,130
rushing a,

294
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,090
of the story,

295
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,730
you know,

296
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,990
a rushing to,

297
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,290
to the end of the story,

298
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,480
but by a 1900,

299
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:26,901
uh,

300
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:27,740
Russia is,

301
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:30,770
is a fanning the flames of pen,

302
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,030
a Slav,

303
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,043
a fervor,

304
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,381
uh,

305
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:34,070
in,

306
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,640
uh,

307
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,450
in,

308
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:35,790
um,

309
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:35,940
the,

310
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,290
the mountain is a territories
of Bosnia Herzegovina,

311
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:39,681
uh,

312
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:40,401
which include is,

313
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:40,731
you know,

314
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:41,990
from the tragedies of,

315
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:42,740
of the,

316
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:42,950
you know,

317
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,071
the,

318
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:43,251
the,

319
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:46,010
the ethnic cleansing of the 1990 serves,

320
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:46,491
uh,

321
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:47,840
Muslims and,

322
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,111
uh,

323
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:48,944
and Catholic,

324
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,490
uh,

325
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:49,820
uh,

326
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,670
Croats.

327
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:55,370
Now the alliance system
of the late 19th century,

328
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,350
which in its own way help,

329
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:57,681
uh,

330
00:06:57,681 --> 00:06:59,780
is one of the causes of World War One.

331
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,660
There are others too that
I'll discuss in a while.

332
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,201
Uh,

333
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:08,030
but it hinges on German and
French antagonism and it,

334
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,540
and it hinges on the competing
interests of Austria,

335
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:12,080
Hungary,

336
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,420
and Russia in the Balkans.

337
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,710
And I hear,

338
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:20,711
I'm summarizing a Germany's fear of
being attacked from both east and west by

339
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,690
Russia and France.

340
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,390
So at the beginning you've got,

341
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:27,200
those are three,

342
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,790
there are five big powers.

343
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,290
And,

344
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,860
and at Bismarck once said,

345
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,430
you know,

346
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,660
and it uses a French phrase,

347
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,690
which is interesting because France,

348
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,450
France was always the
language of diplomacy,

349
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,630
says the most important thing
is to be Artois to be three.

350
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,740
If they're five,

351
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:40,730
you want to be three.

352
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:41,440
But,

353
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:41,780
uh,

354
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,290
what you have basically is
to potential free agents.

355
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,340
Um,

356
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,510
a free agent,

357
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,470
uh,

358
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,970
with a big appetite,

359
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:52,160
been very bad teeth as some wag ones,

360
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:54,350
put it Italy here,

361
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:54,711
uh,

362
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:55,910
which would go to the highest bidder,

363
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,970
1915 and Great Britain.

364
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,261
Now Great Britain.

365
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:03,620
It's not a natural given that
Great Britain was going to,

366
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:03,960
you know,

367
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,390
ally with France,

368
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,140
you know,

369
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,320
it's great enemy for centuries,

370
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:09,920
uh,

371
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,920
or ally with Russia because Britain and
Russia have been fighting for very long

372
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:17,300
time.

373
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,051
What some,

374
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:19,460
another wag one's called the,

375
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:19,791
you know,

376
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,020
the great game,

377
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,820
which is for control a long place.

378
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:22,941
It's,

379
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:24,830
we hear much about these days,

380
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:25,220
uh,

381
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,570
such as northern India,

382
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,770
Pakistan,

383
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,070
you know,

384
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,350
all the way along into South Asia.

385
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,070
So,

386
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,280
you know,

387
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,540
they are rivals,

388
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:32,840
uh,

389
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,620
for,

390
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,190
uh,

391
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:34,371
you know,

392
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:37,800
for influence in all sorts
of different parts of,

393
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,740
of this huge mass of,

394
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,031
of,

395
00:08:40,031 --> 00:08:40,910
of Asia,

396
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:41,720
uh,

397
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,580
in the largest sense of the world.

398
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:44,270
So word.

399
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:44,781
So it's a,

400
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:45,171
one of the thing,

401
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:45,381
you know,

402
00:08:45,381 --> 00:08:47,870
you have to ask if you're just thinking
about it from a point of Frances,

403
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,390
how does it happen that in 1914,

404
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,160
that,

405
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,350
uh,

406
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,320
France finds itself,

407
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:52,520
uh,

408
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,050
allied with Great Britain
and with Great Britain,

409
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:57,540
sometimes enemy,

410
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,931
uh,

411
00:08:57,931 --> 00:08:58,860
that is Russia.

412
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,360
And also from the point of view,

413
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:03,330
if you were a French republican
or you're a French socialist,

414
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:04,770
who is a believer in the Republican,

415
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:05,604
most of them,

416
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,930
most of them were,

417
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,231
uh,

418
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:12,231
how do you explain how a republican
state is allied with the czar,

419
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:12,880
uh,

420
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,880
czarist regime and autocracy a
repressor of all of the peoples and,

421
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:19,161
uh,

422
00:09:19,161 --> 00:09:20,010
among other things,

423
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:20,844
orchestrator,

424
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,390
uh,

425
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,440
encourage your facilitator
enabler of a vicious pogrom,

426
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,120
a pogroms against,

427
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:27,301
uh,

428
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:28,320
against the Jews.

429
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,180
So how this happens,

430
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:30,451
you know,

431
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:30,810
is it,

432
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,450
it's extremely interesting
and it means that,

433
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:33,720
you know,

434
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,100
these powers are on the
search for allies who are,

435
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:38,700
um,

436
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,540
going to,

437
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,050
uh,

438
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,040
give them,

439
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,053
uh,

440
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:42,721
uh,

441
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:43,070
you know,

442
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:43,330
uh,

443
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,730
give them an advantage.

444
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,250
Should Europe go to war?

445
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,570
Now later on,

446
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,270
uh,

447
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,400
I will make the case,

448
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:51,930
and it's the obvious one to make is that,

449
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,340
that most people who followed such
wing things expected a war in their

450
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:57,174
lifetimes.

451
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,800
There had not been a major,

452
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:01,380
Major Kline for conference
[inaudible] for,

453
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,450
so Gracian since ninth,

454
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:03,720
10th,

455
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,500
Waterloo,

456
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:04,951
basically,

457
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:06,000
you'd had wars.

458
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:06,600
Uh,

459
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,230
you have,

460
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:07,500
you know,

461
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,260
fighting after the 1848 revolutions,

462
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:11,670
the intervention of the Russian army,

463
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:12,810
you have the Crimean war,

464
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:13,650
often Crimea,

465
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:14,520
appropriately enough,

466
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,750
1853,

467
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:17,580
1856,

468
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:18,540
you have Russia.

469
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:18,871
I mean,

470
00:10:18,871 --> 00:10:21,090
but Prussia fighting Austria in 1866,

471
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,770
you have the Franco Prussian war,

472
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:23,490
as you know,

473
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,390
in 1870,

474
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:25,224
71.

475
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,590
But basically this period is
sometimes referred to in textbooks.

476
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,300
I don't know if in mind it is or not,

477
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:30,740
but it's the,

478
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,160
it's the Pax Britannica,

479
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:32,910
uh,

480
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,481
because,

481
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:33,691
you know,

482
00:10:33,691 --> 00:10:35,070
England rules the waves,

483
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:35,581
et cetera,

484
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:36,090
et cetera.

485
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,970
But most people thought
there would be a war,

486
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,540
uh,

487
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,540
in their lifetime because of these
antagonisms more than that many people,

488
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,481
how many,

489
00:10:45,481 --> 00:10:49,560
it's difficult to say wanted
a war more about that later.

490
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,060
They expected a war,

491
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:55,260
but nobody expected award that
would carry away four empires,

492
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:55,660
uh,

493
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,970
and millions of lives and will
last way over four years and would,

494
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:00,990
as I've said before,

495
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,740
unleash the demons of the 20th century.

496
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,930
So in 1879,

497
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:10,380
Bismarck for just the
cornerstone alliance,

498
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,130
um,

499
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,950
between Germany and Austria,

500
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:14,963
Hungary,

501
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,370
and it's predicated on German,

502
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,413
um,

503
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:18,660
uh,

504
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,370
support for Austria,

505
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:25,371
Hungary and resistant Hungarian resistance
against Russia's activities in the

506
00:11:26,191 --> 00:11:27,090
Balkans.

507
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:27,900
Uh,

508
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,500
and,

509
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:28,890
uh,

510
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,530
so that,

511
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:30,020
that,

512
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,890
that is a key alliance.

513
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:37,070
And one of the continuity's of this
entire period from 1879 to 1914 is this

514
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,451
alliance,

515
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:41,280
which will become more formalized later.

516
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:46,580
And this explains why it was in July of
1914 the Germans give the famous blank

517
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,930
check and that's a good way of putting it.

518
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:53,950
A blank check to Austria,

519
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:58,951
Hungary after the assassination of the
archduke Franz Ferdinand and Sarah Navel

520
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,910
on the 28th of June,

521
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:02,500
1914 and they say,

522
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,680
you can do whatever you want to Serbia
and we will back you all the way and back

523
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:09,071
you all.

524
00:12:09,071 --> 00:12:09,990
The way is,

525
00:12:09,991 --> 00:12:10,240
is,

526
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,810
that's a big statement because that
means we will back you even in involves

527
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:16,480
eventually going to war with these guys.

528
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,350
You know,

529
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,183
with uh,

530
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,300
the Russian army,

531
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,650
the Russian masses,

532
00:12:20,651 --> 00:12:22,090
the Russian nationalities,

533
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,261
and nobody really knew.

534
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:23,441
I mean,

535
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:26,950
the Russian army had been
defeated and navy as well.

536
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,120
It had been humiliated by the Japanese
in the Russian Japanese war of 1904 1905.

537
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,330
So nobody really knows what,

538
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:35,650
you know what this is going to be like,

539
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:40,150
but they all know it's going to take
two weeks for Russia to mobilize its

540
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:40,601
armies.

541
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:42,400
How do you get all these
people from here to there,

542
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:44,860
yet one railroad line running,

543
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,450
which would cost them in 1904,

544
00:12:46,451 --> 00:12:50,050
1905 running the Vladivostok the port,

545
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,441
you know,

546
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:50,711
on the,

547
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:51,011
on the,

548
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:52,990
on the Pacific Ocean or,

549
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:53,310
well,

550
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,420
I don't know if it's on the
yellow Sierra Pacific Ocean,

551
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:55,691
but it's,

552
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:55,870
you know,

553
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,380
way,

554
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,161
way far away.

555
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:58,240
I've never been to Vladivostok.

556
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,020
Um,

557
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,860
but anyway,

558
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:00,880
this is the key,

559
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,560
uh,

560
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:01,750
you know,

561
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:06,750
the first chip or the first part or
the first block of this alliance and,

562
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,450
and it's,

563
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,060
it's 1879 now a year later,

564
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,280
Italy ally's itself also with,

565
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:12,971
with Austria,

566
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:13,690
Hungary,

567
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,040
and,

568
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,700
and,

569
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,100
um,

570
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,340
with,

571
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,240
with Germany.

572
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:16,900
Um,

573
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,580
but there are all sorts of,

574
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:18,711
of,

575
00:13:18,711 --> 00:13:19,690
of what if,

576
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:20,111
what if,

577
00:13:20,111 --> 00:13:20,621
but if,

578
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:21,454
but if,

579
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:21,910
uh,

580
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,181
you know,

581
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:24,640
attached to that alliance
in Italy basically is,

582
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:25,240
is a,

583
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,073
um,

584
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,160
a free,

585
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,330
a free lance,

586
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:28,840
uh,

587
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,860
a loose cannon,

588
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,670
uh,

589
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,390
during,

590
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:31,601
uh,

591
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:32,500
the entire,

592
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,221
uh,

593
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:34,300
the entire period.

594
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,061
Now,

595
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:35,894
um,

596
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,360
the last thing that Bismarck once
remember Bismark's out of there,

597
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,021
you may not know this,

598
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,270
but he's out of there in about 1894.

599
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:43,691
Isn't that a,

600
00:13:43,691 --> 00:13:45,310
he dies I think in 1894,

601
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:46,144
if I remember right.

602
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:46,811
So He's,

603
00:13:46,811 --> 00:13:48,130
he's not around but,

604
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,540
but his nightmare is
Germany being encircled.

605
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,580
And the last thing that he wanted to
see happen in his lifetime or in the

606
00:13:56,621 --> 00:13:57,700
lifetimes of his,

607
00:13:57,701 --> 00:13:58,060
uh,

608
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,950
somewhat hapless successors,

609
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:00,750
uh,

610
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:00,921
you know,

611
00:14:00,921 --> 00:14:04,870
with the very end that did the demand
with the so much of a authority over or a

612
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:09,871
foreign policy is this is this lagoon
bruhs sad man called Beckman Holdaway

613
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,073
whose name you can,

614
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,700
you can forget who was convinced he
wants tell us his son don't plan a lot of

615
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:17,020
trees on our,

616
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,130
on our estates because the
Russians eventually will
come and take these estates

617
00:14:21,131 --> 00:14:22,150
and they won't do any good.

618
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,170
And he had this sort of fatalism that,

619
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:24,880
that uh,

620
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,240
uh,

621
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,270
he was convinced,

622
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:26,950
uh,

623
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,300
that there will have to be a war.

624
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,190
And he went and says that necessity,

625
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,280
a chilling phrase that that
is echoed in our own time,

626
00:14:33,281 --> 00:14:34,270
in need in our own country.

627
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:37,900
Sometimes necessity knows no law.

628
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,480
Uh,

629
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:38,620
uh,

630
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,340
but anyway,

631
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,330
all of the successors of Bismarck with
the last thing they want to do with is to

632
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:43,930
see,

633
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:44,260
uh,

634
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,230
France ally with these guys here.

635
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,460
Now,

636
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,720
how does that happen?

637
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,823
I mean the,

638
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:51,441
uh,

639
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:51,771
if you,

640
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:53,150
if you go to Paris and you go to the,

641
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:53,420
uh,

642
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,720
one of the more beautiful bridges of
Paris from the end of the 19th century is

643
00:14:56,721 --> 00:15:00,350
the Po Alexon Twat the bridge
of Alexander the third,

644
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,990
which is sort of beautiful
at his art nouveau touches.

645
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:03,410
And,

646
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:07,460
and here with this odd scene of the
czar repressor of all of the peoples,

647
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,060
uh,

648
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,271
you know,

649
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:10,730
showing up and they having to teach the,

650
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:10,911
the,

651
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:11,111
the,

652
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:14,390
the French marine band how to
play the theme song of the czar,

653
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:15,380
whatever that is.

654
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,010
Uh,

655
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,570
and the Russian military ban
learning there must say yes.

656
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:18,990
How,

657
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,030
how in Congress,

658
00:15:20,031 --> 00:15:21,620
since the last thing
that the Russians are,

659
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,890
would ever contemplate was the
kind of government that France has.

660
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,270
How does that happen?

661
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,010
That is really extraordinary.

662
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,371
Well,

663
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:29,990
it has to do with,

664
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,310
uh,

665
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:30,530
you know,

666
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,970
with fear of Germany.

667
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,510
But there are other things that,

668
00:15:33,511 --> 00:15:35,660
that I should mention just briefly that,

669
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,810
that drive these too
improbable powers together.

670
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:39,740
Um,

671
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,161
and,

672
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:40,310
uh,

673
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,020
besides the cultural factor because,

674
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:42,220
uh,

675
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,441
you know,

676
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,274
lots of people,

677
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,390
lots of the Russian elite,

678
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:44,700
uh,

679
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,600
some spoke German depending on where
they live and Koenigsberg and places like

680
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:47,781
that.

681
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:48,441
They spoke German,

682
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:48,870
but,

683
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,430
um,

684
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,101
lots of,

685
00:15:50,101 --> 00:15:50,391
of,

686
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:51,800
of of them spoke French.

687
00:15:51,801 --> 00:15:53,240
And you had these sort of cultural ties.

688
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:54,020
My mother,

689
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,650
uh,

690
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,790
who grew up in Battle Creek,

691
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,260
Michigan of all places,

692
00:15:57,261 --> 00:15:58,790
Kellogg's of Battle Creek,

693
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,720
she was taught French.

694
00:15:59,721 --> 00:16:01,610
They're not very well by a Russian,

695
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,380
um,

696
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,250
a member of the Russian royal family,

697
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:04,461
you know,

698
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:04,761
who are the,

699
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:05,481
all these people when they,

700
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:06,350
and they have to go after,

701
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,480
after the Russian of the
Bolshevik revolution,

702
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:08,811
you know,

703
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:10,580
they come to the United
States and lots of them.

704
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,690
I have a student working on this now and
being taxi drivers in Paris and some of

705
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:15,890
them come to the United States and,

706
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,800
and uh,

707
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,100
and,

708
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,790
and the more he well heeled ones,

709
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:19,700
some of them getting jobs,

710
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:20,091
teaching,

711
00:16:20,091 --> 00:16:20,450
uh,

712
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:20,571
uh,

713
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:20,931
French.

714
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:21,680
But that enough,

715
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,390
it's the old cultural connection is,

716
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:23,601
you know,

717
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:28,130
isn't all that important and that's not
going to drive them together at all.

718
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,260
But there are other forces besides,

719
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,010
uh,

720
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:31,843
you know,

721
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,200
after 1879,

722
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,730
a potential common enemy,

723
00:16:34,731 --> 00:16:36,260
particular this one a,

724
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:41,000
and one of them is economic investment
is that one of those things I mentioned

725
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,940
before about French investors is that,

726
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:44,511
uh,

727
00:16:44,511 --> 00:16:49,511
those with capital to invest
are frequently investing
outside of France and they

728
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:52,220
invest heavily in Russia.

729
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,820
There is still some suits
somewhere in which some,

730
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,430
a French company is trying to get from,

731
00:16:58,431 --> 00:16:59,370
from the Russia of,

732
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,253
of Putin.

733
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:00,960
Uh,

734
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,560
money bat lost in 1917.

735
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,760
It is still going on.

736
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,840
And so lots of money was invested in um,

737
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,200
uh,

738
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,280
in Russia,

739
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:11,660
particularly in Russian railroads.

740
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:12,331
They invest in,

741
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:16,070
in Spanish railroads and an Italian
railroads and in other things as well.

742
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,120
But there is,

743
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,940
this is this conduit and money,

744
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:20,121
you know,

745
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:22,610
money has a big influence
in diplomatic matters.

746
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,250
And if you're trying to explain why it,

747
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,870
why it is that,

748
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,081
uh,

749
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:29,340
the French ambassador forget,

750
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:29,810
uh,

751
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,140
totally forgettable guy
called the [inaudible] pain.

752
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,360
Paleo log is chasing around in the garden,

753
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,490
representatives of the,

754
00:17:36,491 --> 00:17:37,370
of the czar,

755
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:37,880
uh,

756
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,001
uh,

757
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:39,370
trying to firm up the,

758
00:17:39,371 --> 00:17:39,561
the,

759
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:39,980
the,

760
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,330
uh,

761
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:40,500
uh,

762
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,740
the details that,

763
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:41,971
that,

764
00:17:41,971 --> 00:17:43,160
that Russia will,

765
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:44,930
if Francis invaded by Germany,

766
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,800
uh,

767
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,160
you know,

768
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,440
move its armies in this
direction and an attack Russia,

769
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,060
you have to go back to,

770
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:51,930
um,

771
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:52,231
uh,

772
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:53,340
to that,

773
00:17:53,341 --> 00:17:55,800
that fundamental fact is that,

774
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,220
uh,

775
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,610
these economic ties helps solidify,

776
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,180
uh,

777
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,860
the sort of great power,

778
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:02,290
uh,

779
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,123
uh,

780
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,530
uh,

781
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,500
arrangements,

782
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,070
uh,

783
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,420
that are being,

784
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,350
that there are being,

785
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:07,820
um,

786
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:07,981
uh,

787
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:08,460
a made.

788
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,080
And so in 1889,

789
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:15,081
the year of the centenary of the French
Revolution here is the czar of Russia,

790
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,020
uh,

791
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,530
showing up in Paris and,

792
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,970
and being welcomed enthusiastically.

793
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:21,720
Uh,

794
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,201
and,

795
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:22,710
uh,

796
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:22,981
of course,

797
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:24,540
the Socialists don't like it at all.

798
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:24,870
Uh,

799
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,800
because of,

800
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,370
uh,

801
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:26,791
you know,

802
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:27,001
a,

803
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:27,780
and this wasn't even,

804
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,360
this was before the pogrom in,

805
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:29,880
in,

806
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,050
in 1905,

807
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,261
uh,

808
00:18:31,261 --> 00:18:31,461
in,

809
00:18:31,461 --> 00:18:31,770
in,

810
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,210
in particularly in Crimea,

811
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:34,140
but in other places,

812
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:34,870
uh,

813
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,120
as well.

814
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:36,840
Um,

815
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,250
and so in 1892,

816
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:41,070
France and Russia sign a military,

817
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:41,933
a treaty,

818
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:42,361
uh,

819
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:46,620
by which each pledge of military response
if the other were attacked by Germany

820
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,620
or by one or more of its allies.

821
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,430
And there's a formal alliance in 1894.

822
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:53,940
Now,

823
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,870
formal alliances are not published
in figure out Ho or in Utah,

824
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,980
in newspapers,

825
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,410
but everybody knows the
rough outlines of this.

826
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,430
Everybody knows,

827
00:19:02,431 --> 00:19:04,680
nobody has any illusions in London,

828
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:05,040
uh,

829
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,873
in Vienna,

830
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:06,973
in Berlin,

831
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,100
about what,

832
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:08,371
you know,

833
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:09,150
what this,

834
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:09,860
this,

835
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,050
uh,

836
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:10,950
a treaty,

837
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,180
a means.

838
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:17,330
And what this does is it ends what
Bismarck had intended the economic,

839
00:19:17,551 --> 00:19:17,941
I mean that,

840
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:21,930
that diplomatic isolation of France.

841
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:22,950
Um,

842
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,560
and now these guys are,

843
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,573
are surrounded.

844
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:30,870
Now how does Britain
get into this briefly?

845
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:31,741
Well,

846
00:19:31,741 --> 00:19:33,240
Britain gets into this,

847
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,140
um,

848
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,100
in the following way,

849
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,300
uh,

850
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,110
that,

851
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,740
uh,

852
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,740
Germany basically becomes a much
bigger economic rival than anyone else,

853
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:43,700
uh,

854
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,210
that the German economy,

855
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:45,690
uh,

856
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,450
particularly industrial
economy grows rapidly.

857
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,200
Uh,

858
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,381
uh,

859
00:19:49,381 --> 00:19:49,950
they,

860
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,071
uh,

861
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:54,000
virtually they're nipping at the British
heels in terms of steel production.

862
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,610
They're cranking out huge battleships,

863
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,870
which are called dreadnought.

864
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,660
Battleships are the,

865
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,590
that's just the size of the ship.

866
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,041
I,

867
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,200
and has an advantage in
military things to be,

868
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,190
have the latest guns and the latest
ships as opposed to ones made older,

869
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:08,970
uh,

870
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,200
and that sort of thing.

871
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:12,660
So there are nipping at their
heels and then some aspects,

872
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:15,030
even steel production increasing and they,

873
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:15,480
they,

874
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,850
they go way ahead in chemistry.

875
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,830
The Germans are without any question,

876
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,221
you know,

877
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:21,450
the leading power,

878
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:21,960
uh,

879
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,231
uh,

880
00:20:22,231 --> 00:20:23,670
in chemical production account,

881
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,920
chemical expert experimentation,

882
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:28,020
and the universities play a major,

883
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,310
major role in that.

884
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,150
Um,

885
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:30,840
so,

886
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:30,961
uh,

887
00:20:30,961 --> 00:20:31,560
and that,

888
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:31,830
uh,

889
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,360
with his economic rivalry,

890
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,170
uh,

891
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:34,631
uh,

892
00:20:34,631 --> 00:20:35,041
is,

893
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:35,700
which has,

894
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:35,971
you know,

895
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:38,310
has things evolved in Africa,

896
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:38,820
uh,

897
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,001
you know,

898
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:40,200
imperial rivalry there,

899
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:40,741
et Cetera,

900
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:41,574
et Cetera,

901
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,090
uh,

902
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,780
goes the naval rivalry that heats up,

903
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:46,350
uh,

904
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,130
after the of the century.

905
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:48,701
Uh,

906
00:20:48,701 --> 00:20:49,240
and,

907
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,481
uh,

908
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,550
in both Germany and in,

909
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,120
uh,

910
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,331
in,

911
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:53,710
in Britain as in France,

912
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:54,520
you've got these navy,

913
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,540
Naval Leagues,

914
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,220
you've got these groups of citizens,

915
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:57,581
you know,

916
00:20:57,581 --> 00:21:01,870
invite admirals to dinner to give
thundering speeches about defeating,

917
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,470
you know,

918
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,130
the perfidious Albion are
defeating and I'm whomever,

919
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:05,380
you know,

920
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:05,980
they all,

921
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,401
they want.

922
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:08,020
But what they really want to do is to get,

923
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:09,520
to get their countries to build more,

924
00:21:09,521 --> 00:21:09,990
uh,

925
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,150
uh,

926
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,170
more big ships.

927
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:11,561
And of course,

928
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,150
industrialists just love that.

929
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:13,870
Uh,

930
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:14,380
and,

931
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:14,561
uh,

932
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:14,751
the,

933
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:14,990
the,

934
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,840
the stuff that Charles was
talking about the other day,

935
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:17,081
I mean,

936
00:21:17,081 --> 00:21:17,710
you bring,

937
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:17,921
you know,

938
00:21:17,921 --> 00:21:18,520
bring a,

939
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,850
and explored a lunch and have
him talk about how awful the,

940
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,201
you know,

941
00:21:22,201 --> 00:21:23,350
the horrible huns are.

942
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:24,250
That is the Germans,

943
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:27,280
the bullsh and all that effort
in the French case and it all.

944
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,510
And so they have this big,

945
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:33,070
big rivalry going on because Britain's
control of the C's is basically,

946
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:33,520
uh,

947
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:33,851
Ben.

948
00:21:33,851 --> 00:21:35,890
For centuries in world war one,

949
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:38,290
there was only one naval
battle of any consequence,

950
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,760
which is basically a draw,

951
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,300
uh,

952
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,070
but in which,

953
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,380
uh,

954
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:41,830
the Brit,

955
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,380
British navy forces the Germans back,

956
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:44,910
uh,

957
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,220
uh,

958
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:45,850
this is,

959
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,061
you know,

960
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:50,650
in the next war will force the Germans
back into port of battle up here.

961
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,410
So the last thing they do that the,

962
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:53,244
that the British,

963
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:53,501
uh,

964
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:55,270
think that they can do is lose control.

965
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:59,750
The seas and all these big German ships
in the kind of aggressive way that there

966
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:00,880
are not graded by this,

967
00:22:00,881 --> 00:22:01,230
you know,

968
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:01,600
uh,

969
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,890
Nicholas or via,

970
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:03,520
uh,

971
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:03,910
uh,

972
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:04,061
uh,

973
00:22:04,061 --> 00:22:04,990
the Kaiser Wilhelm,

974
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:05,471
the second,

975
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:05,621
you know,

976
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:06,640
banging bottles of,

977
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:07,060
uh,

978
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,361
of,

979
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:07,690
uh,

980
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:07,900
uh,

981
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,060
German champagne over
the ships and giving it,

982
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:10,271
you know,

983
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:10,631
more,

984
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:11,080
uh,

985
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,620
uh,

986
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,460
heated speeches about Germany's
destiny in place in the world,

987
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,181
et Cetera,

988
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:16,930
et cetera.

989
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,570
And so what happens is that
basically the British government,

990
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,320
uh,

991
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,910
which is to say,

992
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,161
you know,

993
00:22:21,161 --> 00:22:22,180
for a long time it said,

994
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:22,301
well,

995
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:22,750
we're not gonna.

996
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,700
We don't need to make an
alliance with anyone else,

997
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,450
uh,

998
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:25,781
uh,

999
00:22:25,781 --> 00:22:26,860
with anyone at all.

1000
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,550
Uh,

1001
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,151
now,

1002
00:22:28,151 --> 00:22:28,984
um,

1003
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:29,981
as tension,

1004
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:34,270
economic tension followed by political
enabled tension of between Germany and,

1005
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:34,750
uh,

1006
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,583
uh,

1007
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,700
and Britain,

1008
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,010
uh,

1009
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,590
increased,

1010
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,211
they increased,

1011
00:22:38,211 --> 00:22:42,880
they begin looking to across
the channel to z French.

1012
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,050
Um,

1013
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:44,883
and,

1014
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,833
um,

1015
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:46,961
I said,

1016
00:22:46,961 --> 00:22:47,820
I said earlier that in,

1017
00:22:47,821 --> 00:22:49,420
in the eighties and nineties,

1018
00:22:49,421 --> 00:22:51,100
and the full Shota incident is in what,

1019
00:22:51,101 --> 00:22:51,934
1890,

1020
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,350
1898 or 99.

1021
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,183
I can't remember.

1022
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,720
It doesn't matter if you ask people in
Paris or Leon or some big city or Boldo,

1023
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,171
uh,

1024
00:22:59,171 --> 00:22:59,531
it were,

1025
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:00,600
the next war was going to be,

1026
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,930
they would say it's against the British.

1027
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:03,880
And let me give you an example of that.

1028
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,450
Uh,

1029
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,700
there were lots of people expected wars.

1030
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,031
You know,

1031
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:11,110
there are these folks that are writing
future war novels and it's just that,

1032
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:11,231
you know,

1033
00:23:11,231 --> 00:23:12,550
as you and val and all of that,

1034
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:13,990
and there were these sort of science,

1035
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:14,800
uh,

1036
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,970
inspired novels and writing that
reflected Eq electricity and,

1037
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,400
and it's our space wars kind of stuff.

1038
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,110
But there were also future war novels.

1039
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:23,790
And,

1040
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,190
um,

1041
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,570
one of the more ridiculous ones,

1042
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,291
the author of,

1043
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:26,670
of,

1044
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,760
of which escapes me,

1045
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:28,191
uh,

1046
00:23:28,191 --> 00:23:30,910
was a novel published that had
some success in England in,

1047
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:32,830
in the 1890s.

1048
00:23:32,831 --> 00:23:34,710
And it involves a future war against whom,

1049
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,560
not the Germans,

1050
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,550
but against the French.

1051
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,020
And the novel goes something like this.

1052
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:38,231
I mean,

1053
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:39,460
would never want to read such a thing.

1054
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:39,911
Uh,

1055
00:23:39,911 --> 00:23:41,050
is that the people in,

1056
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,500
uh,

1057
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:41,771
you know,

1058
00:23:41,771 --> 00:23:43,090
Dover down here,

1059
00:23:43,091 --> 00:23:44,350
the white cliffs of Dover,

1060
00:23:44,351 --> 00:23:47,540
one day they wake up on
Sunday morning and my God,

1061
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:47,650
the,

1062
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:47,910
the,

1063
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,310
the French have arrived,

1064
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,360
uh,

1065
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,130
and in there a sneaky ways they have
been digging a tunnel under the English

1066
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:55,760
Channel.

1067
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,700
Now Napoleon wanted to dig a
tunnel under the English Channel.

1068
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,160
We now have a tunnel under
the English Channel was,

1069
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:03,740
and there again about four to
five weeks ago or six weeks ago.

1070
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:04,430
Um,

1071
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,230
ray rapidly,

1072
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:05,390
the,

1073
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:05,621
the,

1074
00:24:05,621 --> 00:24:05,781
the,

1075
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:06,021
you know,

1076
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:08,600
the fast train that finally
after all these years,

1077
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:11,600
the British finally did their part and
now at the train actually runs fairly

1078
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:12,610
fast after rice,

1079
00:24:12,611 --> 00:24:13,610
a Dover instead of just,

1080
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,240
you know,

1081
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,610
slinking along in the mud
until it gets to London.

1082
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,250
But,

1083
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:17,480
uh,

1084
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,070
so these folks go out to have their,

1085
00:24:19,071 --> 00:24:19,281
you know,

1086
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:19,710
their,

1087
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,210
uh,

1088
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:23,570
greasy eggs and chips and all this kind
of stuff and on a Sunday morning and

1089
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:26,960
they suddenly see z French
are there and they are armed.

1090
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,033
And you know,

1091
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,970
they have been,

1092
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:32,870
they have snuck through this tunnel
that's been being built underneath and

1093
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:36,410
they're sneaky ways and then
they pop up with their guns.

1094
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,390
And the thing that's a ludicrous,

1095
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:41,540
I mean talk about national
stereotypes is that in this novel,

1096
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,321
the soldiers,

1097
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:43,430
at least the avant garde,

1098
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:46,670
the first people arriving are
dressed as French waiters,

1099
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,390
uh,

1100
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,740
and under their large,

1101
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:48,990
you know,

1102
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,060
dirty napkins.

1103
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:50,301
Again,

1104
00:24:50,301 --> 00:24:52,480
this is the British image
of the French as large are,

1105
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,500
are sneaky weapons that they have been,

1106
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:54,980
you know,

1107
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,690
they have been,

1108
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:56,050
uh,

1109
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,980
a building and then the hiding.

1110
00:24:57,981 --> 00:24:59,180
And of course they rush out,

1111
00:24:59,181 --> 00:25:00,200
they seized over,

1112
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,040
and then the,

1113
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,400
uh,

1114
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,630
the British people,

1115
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:03,020
you know,

1116
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,370
rally and of course a,

1117
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:07,970
they call out the constables and they
drive them back into the tunnel and plug

1118
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:08,541
up the tunnel.

1119
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:09,374
And that's the end of that.

1120
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:10,011
Of course,

1121
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:10,880
it's a call for,

1122
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,211
you know,

1123
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:12,740
for more military preparation,

1124
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:13,490
etc.

1125
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:13,701
You know,

1126
00:25:13,701 --> 00:25:15,140
there's another similar novel,

1127
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:15,621
uh,

1128
00:25:15,621 --> 00:25:16,361
written in a,

1129
00:25:16,361 --> 00:25:16,640
you know,

1130
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,500
about 1904 and 1805.

1131
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,340
And it's simply,

1132
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,680
it doesn't involve people in
Dover involves people up in,

1133
00:25:21,681 --> 00:25:21,880
you know,

1134
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,360
Whitby Scarborough and the northeastern
coast where the wind is always

1135
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,800
horizontal and the rain is pounding on
you from every conceivable direction and

1136
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:34,490
they wake up and what they see are these
huge dreadnought battleships lobbing

1137
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:38,420
enormous shells and destroying
British homes in British people,

1138
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,290
uh,

1139
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:39,471
uh,

1140
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,490
with big guns.

1141
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:42,130
And the point of the novel outside of,

1142
00:25:42,131 --> 00:25:42,290
you know,

1143
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,310
putting people to sleep,

1144
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:43,910
uh,

1145
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,930
was to get,

1146
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:45,200
uh,

1147
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,050
to encourage yet more military
preparations to fight a war,

1148
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:50,270
not against the French anymore,

1149
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:54,950
but against the Germans
and events in 1905,

1150
00:25:54,951 --> 00:25:56,600
the first Moroccan crisis,

1151
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:58,520
which you can read about
in chip star wines,

1152
00:25:58,521 --> 00:26:03,521
book followed inevitably in 1911
by the second to Moroccan crisis.

1153
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,820
What this has to do with
German Saber rattling in,

1154
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,541
uh,

1155
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:09,374
in Morocco,

1156
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,130
I into untold shaves.

1157
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,590
Tangiers specifically in the
second case in which the czar,

1158
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,400
those are the Kaiser himself,

1159
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:16,970
uh,

1160
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:17,091
uh,

1161
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:17,990
shows up.

1162
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,300
And what this does is it convinces the,

1163
00:26:21,301 --> 00:26:21,511
the,

1164
00:26:21,511 --> 00:26:22,590
the British that maybe,

1165
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:22,911
you know,

1166
00:26:22,911 --> 00:26:27,200
allying with the French isn't
such a dumb idea after all.

1167
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:32,240
And so they begin to have informal
military talks that become formal military

1168
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:34,730
talks that become an entente,

1169
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,960
same word in English.

1170
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,480
And understanding that's a formal
understanding where they're sitting down

1171
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,750
saying the obvious things.

1172
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,231
You,

1173
00:26:42,231 --> 00:26:43,130
the British navy,

1174
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,060
we'll take care of the English Channel.

1175
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,950
You'll take care of the North Sea.

1176
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,670
Uh,

1177
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,120
we,

1178
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,010
the French navy in tunnel,

1179
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,610
uh,

1180
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,540
down here,

1181
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,110
we will be responsible for the defense of,

1182
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:55,561
uh,

1183
00:26:55,561 --> 00:26:57,090
of the Mediterranean.

1184
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,060
And this is of course,

1185
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,720
more this isn't because of
the influence of Germany,

1186
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:01,430
uh,

1187
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:01,730
in,

1188
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,460
in,

1189
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:02,630
uh,

1190
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,391
in Turkey.

1191
00:27:03,391 --> 00:27:05,250
And Turkey will find
the come in as you know,

1192
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:06,960
in the war on the German side,

1193
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,820
thus Gallipoli's where the British
officers send all the Australians and New

1194
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,510
Zealanders to,

1195
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,930
to die this certain death up a heel
that couldn't possibly be conquered.

1196
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:16,970
Ah,

1197
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:17,190
ah,

1198
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,710
this what they sent in
British soldiers to,

1199
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:19,563
they sent everybody.

1200
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,160
Uh,

1201
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,611
but anyway,

1202
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:21,151
so it's more,

1203
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:21,421
you know,

1204
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:23,190
there is a reason also because Austria,

1205
00:27:23,191 --> 00:27:24,930
Hungary then did have a port.

1206
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:25,920
Uh,

1207
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,191
uh,

1208
00:27:26,191 --> 00:27:26,700
so,

1209
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:26,911
uh,

1210
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:29,370
this is no mere gesture toward the French,

1211
00:27:29,371 --> 00:27:30,390
but this explains hot.

1212
00:27:30,391 --> 00:27:31,011
Was that these,

1213
00:27:31,011 --> 00:27:31,351
these,

1214
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:31,860
uh,

1215
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,340
uh,

1216
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,160
these two also fairly unlikely powers,

1217
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:35,550
uh,

1218
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,420
come together more ever.

1219
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,110
Moreover,

1220
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,960
remember what I've come
back to two or three times.

1221
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,260
Uh,

1222
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,220
the birth rate.

1223
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:41,850
Uh,

1224
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,031
you know,

1225
00:27:42,031 --> 00:27:42,720
the French,

1226
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,260
uh,

1227
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,280
realize that the,

1228
00:27:44,281 --> 00:27:44,790
that you know,

1229
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,930
they're there if the ward,

1230
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,920
if it's more than just a short encounter
and Lord knows who had become VAD,

1231
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:50,730
uh,

1232
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,230
more about this during World War One,

1233
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:52,860
uh,

1234
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,251
that the,

1235
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:53,551
that the,

1236
00:27:53,551 --> 00:27:54,480
their birth rate is,

1237
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:59,481
is so minuscule compared to the rest of
Europe that you better have allies if

1238
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:01,470
you're going to be fighting the Germans,

1239
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,340
you better have allies.

1240
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,960
And everybody knew what
the birth rates were.

1241
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,290
Here,

1242
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,071
just some example,

1243
00:28:05,071 --> 00:28:07,410
this is live birth per
a thousand inhabitants,

1244
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,550
1908,

1245
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:09,570
1913.

1246
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,740
So key period,

1247
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:11,923
um,

1248
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:12,960
France,

1249
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,580
19.5,

1250
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,180
England 24.9.

1251
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:20,960
Okay.

1252
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,830
Germany,

1253
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,290
29.5.

1254
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:25,990
Okay.

1255
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,681
European,

1256
00:28:26,681 --> 00:28:27,131
Russia,

1257
00:28:27,131 --> 00:28:31,240
45.6 in Italy,

1258
00:28:31,241 --> 00:28:32,710
32.4.

1259
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,310
So military planners know this stuff.

1260
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,350
They know that exactly.

1261
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,860
And that means it's all that more
important for the French if they're

1262
00:28:41,861 --> 00:28:45,970
contemplating this war
to take that space back,

1263
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,510
to count on all of these people.

1264
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,700
But it will take these people,

1265
00:28:51,701 --> 00:28:52,181
as I said,

1266
00:28:52,181 --> 00:28:53,770
two weeks to mobilize.

1267
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,320
And that's why the declaration,

1268
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:56,831
the mobile,

1269
00:28:56,831 --> 00:28:58,540
the act of mobilization,

1270
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:03,430
the decree of the czar is
tantamount to an act of war.

1271
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:08,740
Because what this does is this is
leaping ahead and I'll come back to it,

1272
00:29:08,741 --> 00:29:12,790
but it's important enough that it's
worth coming back to what this tells the

1273
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:13,331
Germans.

1274
00:29:13,331 --> 00:29:17,560
They have two weeks in
order to defeat France.

1275
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:23,770
They're sure they can do it and then
you better stop because this big bear,

1276
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,900
it's going to have mobilized all of these
people in Central Asia and other parts

1277
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:34,350
and they're going to be lumbering
towards you so you better stop him in two

1278
00:29:35,771 --> 00:29:36,604
weeks.

1279
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,200
How are you going to do that?

1280
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:43,570
French have big forts all along here,

1281
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,430
here and there and everywhere.

1282
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:49,360
The way your and you know they're going
to want move immediately into Alsace.

1283
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:52,270
Sohan more about this again later.

1284
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:55,960
So the way to do it and
not for the last time,

1285
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,130
they are willing to
violate Belgian neutrality,

1286
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,200
induction neutrality.

1287
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:05,500
So that disappears from the
plan to Schlieffen plan,

1288
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:06,340
which I'll come back to.

1289
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:11,320
A Nike written in 1905 is predicated on
the fact that the French are going to

1290
00:30:11,321 --> 00:30:16,321
invade SSRN and so you just
sweep into a neutral country,

1291
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:21,870
Belgium since 19 neutral since
1831 now what does that do?

1292
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:26,890
That guarantees that
without any question at all

1293
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,720
guarantees that the
British will go to war.

1294
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:37,890
Why for the British it seems bad enough
to have the French across the channel,

1295
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:42,400
but what did you have the
Germans in Belgium in Austan,

1296
00:30:42,401 --> 00:30:45,370
which this is a short
hop across the channel

1297
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,520
and really is the shortest way or one
of the two shortest ways to get across.

1298
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,770
So that's impossible.

1299
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,090
You can't have that.

1300
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,680
So you're going to go to war.

1301
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,173
Now,

1302
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,380
was that a risk that your,

1303
00:30:59,381 --> 00:31:01,720
why was that a risk that
Germans were willing to take?

1304
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,150
Because the English,

1305
00:31:04,151 --> 00:31:06,220
the British do not have a conscript army.

1306
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,930
They have a tiny army,

1307
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:12,790
it's called an expeditionary force
and we'll take them a long time,

1308
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:17,791
months and maybe longer to raise the kind
of army that could make any difference

1309
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:23,890
in the long run here in
France and in Belgium.

1310
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,863
So these deck,

1311
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,430
these cards is house of cards,

1312
00:31:27,431 --> 00:31:28,210
is there.

1313
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,130
These entangling alliances are there.

1314
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,650
And so that's basically what happens in,

1315
00:31:32,651 --> 00:31:32,831
in,

1316
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:33,071
you know,

1317
00:31:33,071 --> 00:31:38,071
in 1914 is when I remember we're going
to Sarajevo before it was destroyed in

1318
00:31:40,571 --> 00:31:41,111
the nineties.

1319
00:31:41,111 --> 00:31:42,460
And I remember putting my seat word,

1320
00:31:42,461 --> 00:31:44,350
the 16 year old gunner,

1321
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:44,741
uh,

1322
00:31:44,741 --> 00:31:45,574
principally,

1323
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:46,743
uh,

1324
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:51,180
put his feet as he and when the archduke
Franz Ferdinand driver had the data.

1325
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,280
Do you have backing up after having missed
a turn after they tried to kill them

1326
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:57,370
once and then prince of suddenly finds
himself with the arch bishop or the

1327
00:31:57,371 --> 00:31:57,761
Archbishop,

1328
00:31:57,761 --> 00:32:02,080
the archduke and his wife there
and he blows them away right there.

1329
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,800
This leads to the blank check and it,

1330
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:06,634
it's going to what,

1331
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,720
and you can read about this.

1332
00:32:07,721 --> 00:32:09,820
You already know it from
high school history.

1333
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:10,803
It brings,

1334
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,750
it brings Europe into this,

1335
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,410
uh,

1336
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,340
this dreadful war.

1337
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:16,623
Now,

1338
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,430
some more things,

1339
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,180
uh,

1340
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,140
some more things.

1341
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,573
Um,

1342
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:22,830
first,

1343
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,230
uh,

1344
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,070
let me just give you,

1345
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,170
do I have time for that?

1346
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,140
Yeah.

1347
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:28,973
Let,

1348
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,840
let me give you an example of,

1349
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,610
of how the stakes get,

1350
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:34,270
uh,

1351
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,860
the tension gets heated up.

1352
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:36,791
Now again,

1353
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:37,930
like revolutions,

1354
00:32:37,931 --> 00:32:40,500
wars don't necessarily break out of,

1355
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:40,841
uh,

1356
00:32:40,841 --> 00:32:45,230
according to the hydraulic model where
things are awful in 1910 and 1911,

1357
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:47,240
that's even more tans 1912,

1358
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:47,780
oh my God.

1359
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,381
1913,

1360
00:32:48,381 --> 00:32:49,214
1914.

1361
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,113
It's got to come.

1362
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,530
It doesn't work like that.

1363
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:52,520
Um,

1364
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:52,770
you know,

1365
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,120
[inaudible] you have the
Balkan wars going on,

1366
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:55,520
uh,

1367
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:55,971
a dominant,

1368
00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:57,140
the Balkans appropriately enough,

1369
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:57,411
you know,

1370
00:32:57,411 --> 00:32:57,830
and,

1371
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,330
and,

1372
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:58,930
uh,

1373
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:02,540
a couple of years before
World War One and all of that.

1374
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,590
But there are these,

1375
00:33:03,591 --> 00:33:05,420
these moments like 1905,

1376
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:07,370
the first Moroccan affair in 1911,

1377
00:33:07,371 --> 00:33:08,690
the second Moroccan affair,

1378
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,110
uh,

1379
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:13,100
that raise the tensions between these
countries and make it possible for the

1380
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:13,280
kid,

1381
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:17,950
for the popular press and sort of the
culture of war to target the enemy that

1382
00:33:17,951 --> 00:33:18,130
you know,

1383
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,430
the enemy for the future war.

1384
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,720
And in this incident,

1385
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,310
uh,

1386
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,143
[inaudible],

1387
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:22,730
uh,

1388
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,770
is at least interesting enough to

1389
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,310
Ah,

1390
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:31,820
no,

1391
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,653
in German,

1392
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:33,943
in France,

1393
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:34,320
uh,

1394
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,350
to discuss because it,

1395
00:33:35,351 --> 00:33:35,511
you know,

1396
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:36,690
it leads to this,

1397
00:33:36,691 --> 00:33:37,920
this increase in tension.

1398
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:41,530
And this is his 1913 now el sauce.

1399
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,240
Um,

1400
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:42,451
uh,

1401
00:33:42,451 --> 00:33:45,690
LCFF and parts of Lauren
are annexed in 1871,

1402
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,820
but the German high co,

1403
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:47,450
the German,

1404
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:47,800
uh,

1405
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,180
uh,

1406
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,940
government doesn't
really trust El Stations.

1407
00:33:50,941 --> 00:33:51,331
In fact,

1408
00:33:51,331 --> 00:33:54,900
they don't have the same statute
within the empire as the other parts of

1409
00:33:54,901 --> 00:33:55,291
Germany,

1410
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:56,090
such as Bavaria,

1411
00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:00,330
Vertin Berg or Hanover that they have are
Pomerania or Brandenburg or any of the

1412
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:01,164
other states.

1413
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:01,790
Um,

1414
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,010
they,

1415
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:02,700
they are,

1416
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,360
uh,

1417
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,141
they are part of the,

1418
00:34:04,141 --> 00:34:04,801
of the empire,

1419
00:34:04,801 --> 00:34:08,180
but they don't have all the rights as a
matter of fact that the representatives

1420
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:12,540
in the right stock from Alsace and
Lauryn cannot vote on certain key,

1421
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,050
you know,

1422
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,790
foreign policy matters and,

1423
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:15,031
and,

1424
00:34:15,031 --> 00:34:15,870
and all of that.

1425
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,700
So there's a lot of tension there.

1426
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:18,743
But again,

1427
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,061
showing the,

1428
00:34:20,061 --> 00:34:20,250
the,

1429
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:20,581
the,

1430
00:34:20,581 --> 00:34:23,010
the sort of people can
have multiple identities,

1431
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:23,550
you know,

1432
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:26,330
to be sure many people
left El Sauce and uh,

1433
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:26,641
and,

1434
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:29,300
and the hen and move
to Paris and move to a,

1435
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:29,980
uh,

1436
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:30,200
uh,

1437
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,290
move to bell fark and all sorts of Naafi
and all sorts of places after 1871,

1438
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:35,430
because they didn't want to be German.

1439
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,080
But El Sauce,

1440
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,540
it is basically an end.

1441
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:44,250
Lorenn is basically
German speaking in 1913,

1442
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:44,850
uh,

1443
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:45,683
the total,

1444
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:45,901
uh,

1445
00:34:45,901 --> 00:34:47,400
just to give you an example,

1446
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:47,810
uh,

1447
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,470
of the number of communes in,

1448
00:34:49,471 --> 00:34:50,100
um,

1449
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:50,610
uh,

1450
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:52,830
administrative units in 1913,

1451
00:34:52,831 --> 00:34:57,831
385 spoke French refreshes
the majority language in 385,

1452
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,970
1000,

1453
00:34:59,971 --> 00:35:04,971
225 our German speaking and 86,

1454
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:05,401
uh,

1455
00:35:05,401 --> 00:35:06,480
no one has a majority.

1456
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:06,961
So in other words,

1457
00:35:06,961 --> 00:35:10,140
77% of the communes in,

1458
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,660
in El Sauce and,

1459
00:35:11,661 --> 00:35:16,661
and the parts of Lauren that were annexed
our German speaking yet many people

1460
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,391
and not all,

1461
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:19,290
but many people.

1462
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,430
And we don't know how many,

1463
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:20,611
uh,

1464
00:35:20,611 --> 00:35:23,790
consider themselves French
even though they spoke German.

1465
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:23,971
Well,

1466
00:35:23,971 --> 00:35:24,600
why not?

1467
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,690
There are lots of people
who had multiple identities,

1468
00:35:27,691 --> 00:35:31,430
we've talked about her boss to field
that their fracture or Gospel or Provence

1469
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,760
style or or Flemish,

1470
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:33,181
et cetera,

1471
00:35:33,181 --> 00:35:33,900
et cetera.

1472
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,430
So,

1473
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,010
um,

1474
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,020
you've got this sort of,

1475
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:37,681
that situation.

1476
00:35:37,681 --> 00:35:39,690
But Alsace is terribly
important because what,

1477
00:35:39,691 --> 00:35:42,600
when you go up to the
border between Alsace,

1478
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,200
a old franchise off in Germany,

1479
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:45,601
Alsace,

1480
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:46,410
you've got this,

1481
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,730
this cracks are these,

1482
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,250
uh,

1483
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:48,630
what'd he say?

1484
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,170
Catholic.

1485
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:49,690
Anyway,

1486
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,523
it is in English.

1487
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:51,443
You have these,

1488
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,383
you know,

1489
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:53,700
these mountains,

1490
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:54,120
these,

1491
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,040
these summit's really,

1492
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,210
and you've got this road,

1493
00:35:57,211 --> 00:35:59,160
a military road all along the top.

1494
00:35:59,420 --> 00:35:59,700
Uh,

1495
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,920
and so it's an important frontier point.

1496
00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:04,950
And so for the point of view of
the German military in particular,

1497
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:06,160
they don't trust the trustee.

1498
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,003
All stations,

1499
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,530
even though they speak German,

1500
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,280
they speak the same German that is spoke,

1501
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:11,900
uh,

1502
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,200
uh,

1503
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,560
spoken across the,

1504
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:14,760
uh,

1505
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,350
across the Rhine River,

1506
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:16,861
uh,

1507
00:36:16,861 --> 00:36:17,171
in,

1508
00:36:17,171 --> 00:36:17,381
in,

1509
00:36:17,381 --> 00:36:18,240
in Fribourg,

1510
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:18,900
uh,

1511
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,111
uh,

1512
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:20,010
for example.

1513
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:25,250
And what this incident takes place in
1913 does is it confirms the image of

1514
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,500
German aggressiveness,

1515
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,280
uh,

1516
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,830
and,

1517
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:30,380
um,

1518
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,213
um,

1519
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,890
it,

1520
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,620
there's a chance that
could have brought war.

1521
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:34,951
I mean,

1522
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:35,311
it doesn't,

1523
00:36:35,311 --> 00:36:36,320
but there are other reasons too.

1524
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:36,750
Why,

1525
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,060
why Berlin does not trust,

1526
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:39,600
uh,

1527
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,220
Alsatians why?

1528
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,270
One reason is that,

1529
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:42,571
remember,

1530
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:44,400
Bismarck is totally anti Catholic.

1531
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:44,910
You know,

1532
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:45,161
any,

1533
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,240
he wages this war on the Catholics
called the couture comp for the,

1534
00:36:48,241 --> 00:36:48,750
or the,

1535
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,100
uh,

1536
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,470
the,

1537
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,630
the cultural war against the Catholics.

1538
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,430
And within the German empire,

1539
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:54,990
you've got Catholics in the Rhineland,

1540
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,790
you've got Catholics dominant in,

1541
00:36:56,791 --> 00:36:57,840
in Bavaria,

1542
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:58,260
uh,

1543
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,630
and you've got Catholics were in El Sauce,

1544
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,280
and this is part of the problem too.

1545
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:03,114
So you've got to,

1546
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:03,690
uh,

1547
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:04,021
uh,

1548
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:04,290
this,

1549
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,580
these tensions between,

1550
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:06,090
uh,

1551
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,490
between German officers and,

1552
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,240
uh,

1553
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:09,690
uh,

1554
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:09,981
and,

1555
00:37:09,981 --> 00:37:11,220
and Alsatian,

1556
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,030
uh,

1557
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,050
citizens.

1558
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:13,770
Uh,

1559
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:14,790
and finally,

1560
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:15,481
1911,

1561
00:37:15,481 --> 00:37:15,871
Alsace,

1562
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:17,130
Lorraine is recognized as,

1563
00:37:17,131 --> 00:37:17,730
as a,

1564
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,020
as a federal state,

1565
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,400
but they still have to abstain on issues
of war treaties and constitutional

1566
00:37:23,401 --> 00:37:24,120
amendments.

1567
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,060
So you've got this little
town called Xavi on,

1568
00:37:26,061 --> 00:37:27,550
which is very pretty place eight,

1569
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,150
8,000 people with a
canal running through it.

1570
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:30,750
Uh,

1571
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:35,430
you've got your basic German officers
where they're dueling scars and lots of

1572
00:37:35,431 --> 00:37:36,170
tension,

1573
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:36,330
uh,

1574
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,020
between,

1575
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,410
uh,

1576
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:38,940
civilians and soldiers.

1577
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,510
Um,

1578
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,090
and the tension was made
worse when a German officer,

1579
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:42,680
uh,

1580
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:42,900
uh,

1581
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,270
and,

1582
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:44,103
uh,

1583
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:47,490
indeed speaking to some Alsatian
soldiers who were there,

1584
00:37:47,491 --> 00:37:49,550
they tried to being soldiers
from other parts of,

1585
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,000
of,

1586
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,791
of the empire,

1587
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:53,550
to be soldiers in there the
way that you would never find,

1588
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:54,160
uh,

1589
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:54,390
you know,

1590
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:57,180
Castilian or you'll never
find a cat that last soldiers,

1591
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:57,800
uh,

1592
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,380
you know,

1593
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:58,591
uh,

1594
00:37:58,591 --> 00:37:59,280
guarding,

1595
00:37:59,280 --> 00:37:59,960
uh,

1596
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,793
uh,

1597
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:01,501
Barcelona,

1598
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:03,000
you'd find Castilian soldiers.

1599
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:03,480
Uh,

1600
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:03,741
he,

1601
00:38:03,741 --> 00:38:04,170
he,

1602
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:07,470
he refers to all El
stations in extraordinarily,

1603
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:08,150
uh,

1604
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:08,280
uh,

1605
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,050
scatological and pejorative term,

1606
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,580
a in German slang.

1607
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,930
And people don't like that.

1608
00:38:12,931 --> 00:38:14,970
There's a lot of tension
and that word spreads.

1609
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:15,450
Uh,

1610
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,260
and then,

1611
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:16,710
uh,

1612
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:16,891
uh,

1613
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:17,940
an officer says,

1614
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,570
you know,

1615
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,970
I don't care if you kill these bastards.

1616
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:21,331
You know,

1617
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:22,380
what a good thing that would be,

1618
00:38:22,381 --> 00:38:23,310
or something like that.

1619
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,930
And so word spreads.

1620
00:38:24,931 --> 00:38:26,100
And it turned out there was a,

1621
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:26,341
you know,

1622
00:38:26,341 --> 00:38:29,060
a junior officer who had
had the very bad idea of,

1623
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,160
uh,

1624
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,930
of sleeping with a 14 year old,

1625
00:38:30,931 --> 00:38:31,380
uh,

1626
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,400
Alsatian woman.

1627
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,900
And so some of the l station,

1628
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:34,560
uh,

1629
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,600
guys get a little drunk and then they
pull them out of the room and beat the

1630
00:38:37,601 --> 00:38:38,430
hell out of him.

1631
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:38,860
Uh,

1632
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,480
and so things get get,

1633
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:40,830
uh,

1634
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:41,140
you know,

1635
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:41,980
which probably a good idea,

1636
00:38:41,981 --> 00:38:42,371
but I mean,

1637
00:38:42,371 --> 00:38:43,001
they shouldn't have done that,

1638
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:43,271
but it,

1639
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:43,411
it,

1640
00:38:43,411 --> 00:38:43,900
it,

1641
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,540
uh,

1642
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:44,900
it,

1643
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,100
it,

1644
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:45,970
it goes from there.

1645
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,860
It going from there,

1646
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:52,240
and then the German high command and
the newspapers get involved in this,

1647
00:38:52,241 --> 00:38:55,870
and they make it seem like there'd been
insults to the German flag to the German

1648
00:38:55,871 --> 00:39:00,871
emperor by these people who cannot be
trusted because they are who they are,

1649
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,690
et cetera.

1650
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:02,081
And of course,

1651
00:39:02,081 --> 00:39:02,914
the French says,

1652
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,460
say,

1653
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:03,641
well,

1654
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:07,600
these are real French people who are
being attacked and indeed molested in one

1655
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:08,380
case,

1656
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:08,950
uh,

1657
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:09,370
you know,

1658
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:10,203
child rape,

1659
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:10,930
uh,

1660
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:11,141
uh,

1661
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:11,974
essentially,

1662
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,910
at least legally,

1663
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:13,480
uh,

1664
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,660
by these horrible huns and everything,

1665
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,561
it just,

1666
00:39:17,561 --> 00:39:17,800
right.

1667
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,150
The tension level goes out.

1668
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,870
Now they don't go to war but,

1669
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,550
but it confirms these kinds of
stereotypes that you would see by the way,

1670
00:39:24,551 --> 00:39:27,670
in the first year of the
war two where the images of,

1671
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:28,001
you know,

1672
00:39:28,001 --> 00:39:28,840
the Rudel,

1673
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:29,470
uh,

1674
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:29,621
uh,

1675
00:39:29,621 --> 00:39:31,690
German and there were atrocities.

1676
00:39:31,691 --> 00:39:31,931
There were,

1677
00:39:31,931 --> 00:39:34,720
there were atrocities committed by
Germans more than were committed by other

1678
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,490
people on the western front.

1679
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:37,540
That's without question.

1680
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,560
And all these rumors,

1681
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,011
you know,

1682
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:40,390
that kind of confirm this,

1683
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:43,330
this image that is in many ways faults,

1684
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,750
but there was enough of a grain of truth
in it that goes back to this incident.

1685
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,070
So this minor incident,

1686
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:48,940
you know,

1687
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:53,940
essentially a shouting match and a fight
in a small town in El sauce has huge

1688
00:39:54,011 --> 00:39:54,850
implications.

1689
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,200
And what it does is it helps confirm
not only the image of the other,

1690
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,880
but it confirms,

1691
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:01,211
you know,

1692
00:40:01,211 --> 00:40:01,690
these milk,

1693
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,100
these military plans,

1694
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:03,760
uh,

1695
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,760
that from the franchise can be
very important for the home front,

1696
00:40:06,761 --> 00:40:08,710
particularly that you
better when the war starts,

1697
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,980
get your self into Alsace and
Lauryn and take Alsace Lauren back.

1698
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:14,861
You know,

1699
00:40:14,861 --> 00:40:15,461
some of them think,

1700
00:40:15,461 --> 00:40:15,701
well,

1701
00:40:15,701 --> 00:40:16,280
we can't really be,

1702
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,930
are they not going to
really go through Belgium?

1703
00:40:17,931 --> 00:40:18,221
Are they,

1704
00:40:18,221 --> 00:40:20,050
they think that maybe they're
going to be fighting them here.

1705
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:20,531
Of course,

1706
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:22,180
that all will happen,

1707
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:22,520
uh,

1708
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,353
a later.

1709
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:23,920
But,

1710
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,430
um,

1711
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:26,170
so in 1914,

1712
00:40:26,171 --> 00:40:28,360
there really aren't any
surprises the way it,

1713
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,100
and the people who tried to stop the war,

1714
00:40:30,101 --> 00:40:31,360
like Sir Edward Gray,

1715
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,910
who sends that said the lights
are going out all over Europe.

1716
00:40:33,911 --> 00:40:35,860
They will not be lit
against in our lifetime.

1717
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:36,311
Man,

1718
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:37,390
did he ever have that right?

1719
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:37,810
You know,

1720
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,501
absolutely.

1721
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:38,771
Right.

1722
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:39,604
Because the war,

1723
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:43,960
1914 to 1944 is basically
one continuous poisonous war,

1724
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:44,561
a new,

1725
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:45,970
terrible 30 years' war.

1726
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:46,900
Uh,

1727
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,420
but once this had all been set up,

1728
00:40:49,421 --> 00:40:51,070
there wasn't much could happen.

1729
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:51,761
I mean,

1730
00:40:51,761 --> 00:40:53,320
the stop it and the way the war,

1731
00:40:53,321 --> 00:40:57,160
the way the military planning
it goes is it helps explain,

1732
00:40:57,161 --> 00:41:01,600
and I will explain next Monday how it
was that this war that was supposed to be

1733
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:04,420
over before the leaves
fall over before Christmas,

1734
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:04,751
home,

1735
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:05,501
before Christmas,

1736
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:05,971
et Cetera,

1737
00:41:05,971 --> 00:41:06,760
et Cetera,

1738
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,920
and knock Berlin and knock puppies.

1739
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,380
Uh,

1740
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:09,800
uh,

1741
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,290
uh,

1742
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:10,960
Auburn.

1743
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,290
You know,

1744
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:15,100
it goes on for years and years and carries
away an entire generation of people,

1745
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:15,963
of young men,

1746
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:16,720
um,

1747
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,650
an entire generation.

1748
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:18,161
Uh,

1749
00:41:18,161 --> 00:41:21,010
it's built in to the planning
and we will see how that happens.

1750
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:21,910
It's a terribly important,

1751
00:41:21,911 --> 00:41:22,900
so a story.

1752
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,900
And then certainly there is
no event in the 20th century,

1753
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:26,560
uh,

1754
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,770
in which there were so
much been written on this,

1755
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,270
on how the war started.

1756
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,291
I remember my uncle,

1757
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:33,750
my great uncle who fought in,

1758
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:33,920
you know,

1759
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,753
for American,

1760
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,150
he was an American and
he fought in the 1917,

1761
00:41:38,151 --> 00:41:40,120
1918 and all that I
remember and I just didn't,

1762
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,690
I was a little teeny guy when he,

1763
00:41:41,691 --> 00:41:42,350
when he died,

1764
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:42,830
but you know,

1765
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:43,461
they gave me,

1766
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:47,270
they had all the book of the documents
showing that the Germans started at all

1767
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,740
with the Germans didn't start at all.

1768
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:52,700
And that would have a huge impact on what
happens in Germany in 20s and 30s and

1769
00:41:52,701 --> 00:41:54,020
thus be very important.

1770
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:54,590
But,

1771
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,600
but that's why this is
an important subject.

1772
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:58,010
And just in conclusion,

1773
00:41:58,011 --> 00:42:00,140
what else can we say
when obviously it's not,

1774
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:05,500
it's not only these diplomatic factors
and not only this military planning that

1775
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:10,190
brings about this war,

1776
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,390
there's more to it than that.

1777
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,040
And Charles alluded to,

1778
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:13,520
uh,

1779
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,020
uh,

1780
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:14,571
a very,

1781
00:42:14,571 --> 00:42:14,751
uh,

1782
00:42:14,751 --> 00:42:15,501
very effectively,

1783
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:16,334
very cleverly,

1784
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:16,730
uh,

1785
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:18,530
to some of the other
factors the other day.

1786
00:42:18,531 --> 00:42:18,751
And I,

1787
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,540
I barely need to repeat them,

1788
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,700
but that,

1789
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:21,951
uh,

1790
00:42:21,951 --> 00:42:26,930
the imperial rivalry helps create
this culture of popular imperialism,

1791
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:30,920
which feeds in to this culture of popular,

1792
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:35,060
aggressive nationalism
that in which the other,

1793
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:35,810
uh,

1794
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:35,991
uh,

1795
00:42:35,991 --> 00:42:40,190
whether it be an indigenous person
who dare stand up for his or her,

1796
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:40,550
you know,

1797
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,361
rights in,

1798
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:41,710
in,

1799
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:41,920
uh,

1800
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,370
in,

1801
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:42,530
uh,

1802
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,060
Malia or somewhere like that.

1803
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:44,800
Uh,

1804
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,080
it,

1805
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,810
the next stage is
identifying if the other,

1806
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,060
the dangerous other as being ones,

1807
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:50,750
uh,

1808
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:51,440
enemy,

1809
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:51,920
uh,

1810
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,040
traditional enemy in some,

1811
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,520
in the case of Germany and,

1812
00:42:54,521 --> 00:42:54,770
and,

1813
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:55,160
and,

1814
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:55,640
uh,

1815
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,061
uh,

1816
00:42:56,061 --> 00:42:57,110
and France,

1817
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:57,740
uh,

1818
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:58,340
on,

1819
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,173
on the continent.

1820
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,980
And we call this jingoism,

1821
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:01,551
uh,

1822
00:43:01,551 --> 00:43:02,121
from a,

1823
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:02,231
uh,

1824
00:43:02,231 --> 00:43:02,541
from a,

1825
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:03,650
from a poem that was in a,

1826
00:43:03,651 --> 00:43:05,060
in a British newspaper.

1827
00:43:05,061 --> 00:43:07,340
I think that's where it started
by Jingo we'll get them,

1828
00:43:07,341 --> 00:43:07,731
et cetera,

1829
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:08,091
et cetera.

1830
00:43:08,091 --> 00:43:08,551
By Jingo,

1831
00:43:08,551 --> 00:43:09,260
we get them.

1832
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,890
And jingoism basically means
aggressive nationalism.

1833
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,170
And it's this expectation,

1834
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:15,970
uh,

1835
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:16,160
uh,

1836
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,390
that war will come.

1837
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:17,841
Uh,

1838
00:43:17,841 --> 00:43:19,010
which not only,

1839
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:19,340
you know,

1840
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,240
the military,

1841
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:20,640
uh,

1842
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,770
Joseph said to one of the
high commanded in France,

1843
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:25,101
he said,

1844
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:27,890
he anticipate every day
he dreamt of the next war.

1845
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,350
And what it would be like
that it would be wonderful,

1846
00:43:30,351 --> 00:43:31,184
thrilling,

1847
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,640
and the whole light in social and PR,

1848
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,300
the social Darwinist idea that you know,

1849
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,310
that you've got the
survival of the fittest,

1850
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,450
but you know,

1851
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,800
if you're going to show
you are the fittest,

1852
00:43:39,801 --> 00:43:40,970
what a better way to do it.

1853
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:43,310
Then instead of just dueling with some,

1854
00:43:43,311 --> 00:43:43,641
you know,

1855
00:43:43,641 --> 00:43:46,160
some guy in your own national team,

1856
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:46,700
you know,

1857
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,580
getting in dueling scar on some general
that you core with over a woman in a,

1858
00:43:50,581 --> 00:43:50,811
in a,

1859
00:43:50,811 --> 00:43:51,290
in a,

1860
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:54,630
in a tavern sometime now
you're going to show that you,

1861
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,270
you feel a nationality.

1862
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,530
The British,

1863
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:58,363
the French,

1864
00:43:58,490 --> 00:43:59,360
the Germans,

1865
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:00,440
the Russians,

1866
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:00,890
uh,

1867
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:01,723
you name it,

1868
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,220
that you're the best and
you're going to show them,

1869
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,000
uh,

1870
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,980
and you're going to show
them on the battlefield.

1871
00:44:06,981 --> 00:44:08,120
And so the point of view of the French,

1872
00:44:08,121 --> 00:44:08,301
I mean,

1873
00:44:08,301 --> 00:44:08,481
when,

1874
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:08,810
when,

1875
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:11,210
when it has to keep in mind
is the French war invaded.

1876
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:11,631
You know,

1877
00:44:11,631 --> 00:44:13,160
the French did not invade Germany.

1878
00:44:13,161 --> 00:44:14,960
The Germans invaded France say too.

1879
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:15,590
Wow.

1880
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:16,040
But,

1881
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:16,550
uh,

1882
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:16,731
the,

1883
00:44:16,731 --> 00:44:17,570
but nonetheless,

1884
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:20,420
it was this expectation
of war and it wait,

1885
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,530
fits into,

1886
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:22,011
you know,

1887
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:26,750
into these equivalent and boy's life
magazines and popular novels about the

1888
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,670
future war painting,

1889
00:44:28,671 --> 00:44:30,020
the map of the world,

1890
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,590
the color of your particular country,

1891
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,660
red in the case of of Britain,

1892
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:34,321
et Cetera,

1893
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:35,010
et cetera.

1894
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:36,660
All of this comes together and,

1895
00:44:36,661 --> 00:44:37,090
and,

1896
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,970
and it helps us try to explain this,

1897
00:44:38,971 --> 00:44:40,410
this great enthusiasm,

1898
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:43,010
at least in the big
cities at told Bahnhof in,

1899
00:44:43,011 --> 00:44:45,810
in Berlin or at the Gal de last in Paris,

1900
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:46,320
uh,

1901
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,400
for this war.

1902
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,353
Now,

1903
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,690
whether people in other parts of France
and Germany and other places were

1904
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:53,010
enthusiastic about the war,

1905
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:53,980
you know,

1906
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,300
it's a very moot question.

1907
00:44:55,301 --> 00:44:57,390
That's been not been a hotly
debated in many places.

1908
00:44:57,391 --> 00:45:00,090
Obviously they had better things
to do there to get the harvest in,

1909
00:45:00,091 --> 00:45:01,110
which would be one problem,

1910
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:01,770
uh,

1911
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:04,320
on the home front and every place
cause the war starts in the,

1912
00:45:04,321 --> 00:45:04,510
in,

1913
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:05,343
in the summer.

1914
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:05,671
But,

1915
00:45:05,671 --> 00:45:08,220
but the expectation of war
and the culture of war,

1916
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:08,700
uh,

1917
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:09,810
closely tied to,

1918
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:10,590
to,

1919
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:10,720
uh,

1920
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,940
the culture of,

1921
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,150
uh,

1922
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:13,680
of nationalism,

1923
00:45:13,681 --> 00:45:17,550
aggressive nationalism tied to imperialism
and economic rivalry and everything

1924
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:21,240
else helps explain how
this war came about.

1925
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:21,990
Uh,

1926
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:22,410
and the,

1927
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:26,150
the idea of how people accepted the
wars more complicated depending on it,

1928
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:26,910
dependent on,

1929
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:27,091
you know,

1930
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:27,891
where the army is,

1931
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:28,451
war and,

1932
00:45:28,451 --> 00:45:29,284
and all of this.

1933
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,810
And that's a remarkable story.

1934
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:31,710
And instead that,

1935
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:33,720
that all turned in the
second lecture next week,

1936
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:34,051
uh,

1937
00:45:34,051 --> 00:45:34,884
the home front,

1938
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,150
the first lecture next week will be how
we ended up with this trench warfare

1939
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:43,080
that has been so dominant in the visual
images of the war in the museums about

1940
00:45:43,081 --> 00:45:43,860
the war.

1941
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,310
Uh,

1942
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:46,830
and in that great
literature about the war,

1943
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:49,290
some which you'll be reading
when you read Bob Loose,

1944
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:50,500
are they.
