1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,190
Okay.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,023
Um,

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:04,561
by the way,

4
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:06,360
there were big trouble over the weekend,

5
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:06,970
uh,

6
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:07,321
in a,

7
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:08,460
in a suburb next week.

8
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:11,070
The last day I'm going to
talk about the problem.

9
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,330
So called problem of,

10
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,251
of the suburbs.

11
00:00:13,251 --> 00:00:18,251
There's a big problem the other night
and when the policeman ran down,

12
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:18,900
um,

13
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,460
two kids on a scooter,

14
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,413
a screw town,

15
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,280
and they were both killed apparently.

16
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,290
And so there's a lot of
riots again going on.

17
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,011
So you can again,

18
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:29,500
you can follow us if you
know French on a f on false,

19
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:31,840
do TFL and um,

20
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,520
or in the restroom.

21
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,500
But this is a,

22
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,421
but this will probably,

23
00:00:35,421 --> 00:00:38,370
this will probably be in
the newspapers anyway.

24
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,230
So what I want to talk about today,

25
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,280
uh,

26
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,140
it's hard to do both of them in one day,

27
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:44,280
but let's go,

28
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:45,960
is to compliment your reading on,

29
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:48,240
on a decolonization,

30
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:48,570
uh,

31
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,160
and talk about Vietnam and Algeria.

32
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,230
Uh,

33
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,150
and the subtext,

34
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,040
obviously it's not,

35
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,920
it texted intended in the,

36
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:58,321
you know,

37
00:00:58,321 --> 00:00:59,011
in this course,

38
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:00,990
but is that the Americans
never learned the mistakes,

39
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:01,460
uh,

40
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:01,850
uh,

41
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,140
from which the French finally learned.

42
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,440
I next week I,

43
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,350
or next Wednesday,

44
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:09,180
I'll talk about about Charles de Gaulle,

45
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,070
but mostly about after he
comes to power in 1958.

46
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:15,390
But he's obviously important,

47
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:15,990
uh,

48
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,280
in this,

49
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,293
um,

50
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,261
you know,

51
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:24,261
from the beginning that it's after
World War Two that most of the colonies,

52
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,003
uh,

53
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:31,010
in the world became independent
in a process that took a decades.

54
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:31,801
Uh,

55
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:32,634
and of course,

56
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,570
the 1960s pick,

57
00:01:34,571 --> 00:01:35,830
the beginning of the 1960s,

58
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,410
it's a very,

59
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,340
very crucial for,

60
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:37,980
uh,

61
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,910
in the case of,

62
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,773
of um,

63
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,570
uh,

64
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,670
of Africa.

65
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,013
Um,

66
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,853
and this,

67
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,960
despite,

68
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:45,390
uh,

69
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,140
uh,

70
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,330
despite the insistence of a,

71
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,910
of a Winston Churchill for one,

72
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:53,820
that the British empire
would not be a dismembered,

73
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,021
uh,

74
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:56,040
in Britain.

75
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,080
This transition,

76
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,710
uh,

77
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,160
from colony to independent state,

78
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,840
uh,

79
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,690
state often replete full of,

80
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:09,691
of problems came without
violence came generally,

81
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,141
uh,

82
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:10,890
without,

83
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:11,700
uh,

84
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,110
without insurrection.

85
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,340
Uh,

86
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,700
this was not the case with France,

87
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,140
nor as you know,

88
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:19,980
some of you,

89
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,813
not the case.

90
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,520
I was in Portuguese from
Portuguese colonies.

91
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,060
Uh,

92
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,211
uh,

93
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,200
as well.

94
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,101
Uh,

95
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:29,130
the Netherlands and Britain both resisted,

96
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,700
um,

97
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,860
independence movements before,

98
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,401
uh,

99
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:33,900
before a caving in.

100
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,990
And by 1980 a year that
I can even remember,

101
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:37,770
uh,

102
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,270
not with pleasure because
I was married that year.

103
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:39,670
Um,

104
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,370
more than half of the hundred and
54 members of the United Nations,

105
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:44,851
uh,

106
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:48,510
had been admitted to membership since 19,

107
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,020
uh,

108
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,490
56.

109
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,541
Now,

110
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:56,541
one obvious point is that part
of the dismantling of empires,

111
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,303
uh,

112
00:02:59,330 --> 00:02:59,770
the,

113
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:04,270
one of the important theme in
this is that Britain and France,

114
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:04,490
uh,

115
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,130
in the postwar period,

116
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:06,700
uh,

117
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,570
became a less important
powers than they had,

118
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,810
uh,

119
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,643
before,

120
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,131
uh,

121
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:12,964
is that,

122
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,151
uh,

123
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,200
as you know,

124
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:14,920
uh,

125
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,161
uh,

126
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:15,831
France and,

127
00:03:15,831 --> 00:03:19,870
and this was the essential and the goals
view of themself and view of the world,

128
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,530
uh,

129
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,010
uh,

130
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,220
uh,

131
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,830
seeks to retain its role as a great power.

132
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:28,831
But the world had basically been divided
up in the cold war between the Soviet

133
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,370
Union,

134
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:29,650
uh,

135
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,370
and,

136
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:30,581
uh,

137
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:32,080
the United States.

138
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:32,621
Uh,

139
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:34,660
and that both of those powers are,

140
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:38,680
we're competing aggressively for
these newly independent states,

141
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,341
uh,

142
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:40,570
in Africa,

143
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,100
in Asia,

144
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,450
and indeed in,

145
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,020
uh,

146
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,510
north Africa as well.

147
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,381
Um,

148
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:50,560
and so World War Two accentuated,

149
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,161
uh,

150
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:53,260
the independence movements that developed,

151
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:53,531
uh,

152
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:54,450
after World War One.

153
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,810
The case of Vietnam is of course,

154
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:56,740
just classic,

155
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,131
uh,

156
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:57,850
in that,

157
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,510
uh,

158
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:58,991
uh,

159
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:01,000
and you had a well organized,

160
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,720
uh,

161
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,021
uh,

162
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:06,980
nationalist communist movement
ready to assume the mantle of,

163
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:09,580
of yet the Movement for a Vietnamese,

164
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,430
um,

165
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,130
independence.

166
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,120
Um,

167
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,690
and,

168
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:13,901
uh,

169
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:14,800
as you will know that,

170
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:15,071
you know,

171
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:16,000
will Woodrow Wilson,

172
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:20,920
the spouse nationalism as ways that we
determine to determining the existence or

173
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:22,570
the creation of states.

174
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,600
And so Wilson and his American
successors were kind of caught in a,

175
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,450
uh,

176
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:28,691
you know,

177
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:30,700
caught in a trap because
on one hand they're saying,

178
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:30,950
oh,

179
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,150
yeah,

180
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,000
we need to,

181
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:32,530
uh,

182
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:32,891
uh,

183
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:37,240
we need to recognize
independence movements and
people to see themselves as a

184
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:39,820
single nation ought to have the
right to have their own state.

185
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,480
Uh,

186
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,250
but then because of the domain of,

187
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,780
of him,

188
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,720
because of the Cold War,

189
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:45,280
the Americans often found themselves,

190
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:45,900
uh,

191
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,090
uh,

192
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,260
acting in ways that,

193
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:48,011
that they,

194
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:48,700
um,

195
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,533
uh,

196
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,670
did not match a match.

197
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:52,540
Their rhetoric.

198
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,763
Um,

199
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:54,461
the,

200
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:59,461
the French left Syria and Lebanon by
agreement made with United States and

201
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:01,470
Britain,

202
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:01,670
uh,

203
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,340
after the war.

204
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,851
Uh,

205
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:07,180
but the problem of Vietnam and
the problem of North Africa,

206
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:07,361
uh,

207
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:07,841
as you know,

208
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,100
where the French had been since,

209
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:09,251
uh,

210
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:09,880
18,

211
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,180
uh,

212
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,410
30 would be a much thornier now ho ci men.

213
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:14,591
I mean,

214
00:05:14,591 --> 00:05:14,950
I can,

215
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,131
you know,

216
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:15,640
I can remember,

217
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,720
I can remember this,

218
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,440
uh,

219
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,700
sort of a time warp for someone like me
cause I can remember all the marches and

220
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:23,080
was in all the marches against,

221
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,591
uh,

222
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:24,880
against the war.

223
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:25,451
You know,

224
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:26,030
back when I,

225
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,210
when I was your age and you know,

226
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:31,230
the chance of [inaudible] men NLF is,

227
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,380
is going to win.

228
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:33,550
Um,

229
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,110
he had become president of the Democratic
Republic of Vietnam after the war.

230
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,380
A hoochie men's,

231
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,150
uh,

232
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,950
father was an official under,

233
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,530
uh,

234
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,770
under the French under French rule.

235
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,080
And he had resigned from his
position because he had become a,

236
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,000
a Vietnamese,

237
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:49,450
uh,

238
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,340
a nationalist and Holcim men.

239
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,720
And there were other nationals of,

240
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:53,261
by the way,

241
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:55,000
I mean was one has a tendency to say,

242
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:55,211
well,

243
00:05:55,211 --> 00:05:55,361
you know,

244
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:58,400
they get the communist party
representative nationalism,

245
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,590
but there are other nationalists to who,

246
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,150
who,

247
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,900
who weren't communists but
the war because the war end,

248
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,670
the war where the work comes out.

249
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,830
[inaudible] one ends
up talking a lot about,

250
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,550
uh,

251
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,001
uh,

252
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:08,780
about,

253
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,410
um,

254
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,550
communists nationalism.

255
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:14,930
But he had been working on a kitchen
helper on a French passenger aligner,

256
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,560
a crossing the oceans before
becoming a communist activist.

257
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:23,270
And he founded in 1929 the Ho
the Indo Chinese Communist Party,

258
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:28,271
which he founded in Hong Kong in 1929 in
1930 unified three groups of Vietnamese

259
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:30,740
communists around his leadership.

260
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,430
He was condemned to death in absentia,

261
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,490
uh,

262
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,630
by the French government.

263
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,080
And he was saved by the refusal of the
British government in Hong Kong to turn

264
00:06:40,081 --> 00:06:42,350
them over to the French
because he would have been,

265
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,120
he would have been executed,

266
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:45,290
but that without any question.

267
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,070
Uh,

268
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,810
but he was arrested by the British in
1931 and he remained in prison in Hong

269
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,790
Kong until 1933.

270
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:53,451
Uh,

271
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:55,730
and during World War Two,

272
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:57,560
he led the Viet men have yet.

273
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:58,341
And then m I,

274
00:06:58,341 --> 00:07:02,180
N H A in organization of
Vietnamese nationalists,

275
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,230
some of whom,

276
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,130
but as I said before,

277
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:06,680
not all of whom were communists.

278
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,830
Now I'm the French attack,

279
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:11,510
the port of high flying and he's got,

280
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:12,290
these are names,

281
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:12,501
you know,

282
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:13,370
out of my past.

283
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,420
I wasn't,

284
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:14,840
you know,

285
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,970
did not know about Haiphong.

286
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,150
I was a couple of years old then,

287
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,930
uh,

288
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:18,531
not even that,

289
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:19,070
I guess,

290
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,430
uh,

291
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,050
killing 6,000 Vietnamese.

292
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:25,160
And they captured a annoyed
the Vietnamese capital a and a,

293
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:26,150
this is after the war.

294
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,680
And so France restored,

295
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,251
uh,

296
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:30,740
the nominal authority
of a playboy emperor.

297
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,790
Uh,

298
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,241
and,

299
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:34,910
but the whole Holcim is Vietnamese army.

300
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,560
I held most of the countryside
rather like Mousay tongs army,

301
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:39,861
uh,

302
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:40,700
in China.

303
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,810
I've had begun,

304
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,110
uh,

305
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,950
during the war against climate and
Dong A to carve out huge sections of,

306
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,431
of,

307
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:47,681
of,

308
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:49,610
of Chinese territory as well.

309
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,330
And Ho was supported by
the Chinese communists.

310
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,050
Um,

311
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,810
and he prophesies you
will kill 10 of our men.

312
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:57,501
Uh,

313
00:07:57,501 --> 00:07:59,540
but we will kill one of yours.

314
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,591
And in the end,

315
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:02,900
we will end up by wearing you out.

316
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:03,711
Now,

317
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:04,221
this was,

318
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:05,510
this was the origins of,

319
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,770
of at least in the modern
era of a guerrilla warfare,

320
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,090
uh,

321
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:11,181
uh,

322
00:08:11,181 --> 00:08:13,560
French intellectual who still
live in called [inaudible].

323
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:17,990
Hey wrote a very important book that I
remember I had to read in the seminar on

324
00:08:17,991 --> 00:08:22,190
revolutionary elites with Arthur Mendel
at the University of Michigan called

325
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,410
high evolutional dorms.

326
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,880
I to shown a revolution in the revolution,

327
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:26,070
uh,

328
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,620
about a gorilla fighting.

329
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:27,771
Now,

330
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:30,950
if you go back those that go
back to before 1871 and 70,

331
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:31,784
71,

332
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,390
uh,

333
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:32,691
uh,

334
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:33,511
you remember what,

335
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:34,050
what the,

336
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:34,883
the Spanish,

337
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,783
um,

338
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,170
uh,

339
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,430
patriots were able to do in a,

340
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,050
in Spain against Napoleon's
occupying forces,

341
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,210
which was to pick them off one by one.

342
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:48,710
And the French retaliated by shooting
down civilians as they did in Calabria in

343
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:50,300
the south of Italy and other places.

344
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,140
Uh,

345
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,060
but you know,

346
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:52,400
we will,

347
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,160
you will kill 10 of ours and we will kill,

348
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:55,650
uh,

349
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,000
one of yours and Annette.

350
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,620
And eventually what happens in,

351
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,060
in the Vietnam case,

352
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,410
I is that,

353
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,130
uh,

354
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,600
as in the Algerian case is that the
pressure to pull out of the war becomes so

355
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:07,434
enormous,

356
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,010
uh,

357
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,730
that that strategy wins and
that the costs of continuing,

358
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,330
uh,

359
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,163
to,

360
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:13,920
to,

361
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,521
to fight,

362
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:15,091
to battle,

363
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:15,781
to repress,

364
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:17,640
depending on your view of the matter,

365
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,270
uh,

366
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,740
will affect the home
front and the Home Front,

367
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,171
uh,

368
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:22,740
will,

369
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,130
uh,

370
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:23,910
demand,

371
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,061
uh,

372
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:25,140
the end of,

373
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:25,561
uh,

374
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:26,280
of the,

375
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,850
of,

376
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,683
uh,

377
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,670
of the fighting and indeed of,

378
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,230
of the empire.

379
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:31,740
Uh,

380
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,570
early in 1954,

381
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:38,760
the French army suffered a major defeat
at the hands of the Vietnamese at a

382
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:41,360
place called den Bn Ph.

383
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,540
You at the end,

384
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:42,901
uh,

385
00:09:42,901 --> 00:09:43,440
which,

386
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:43,800
uh,

387
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,140
is now a tourist site for
lots of French go there.

388
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:47,160
I've never been there.

389
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,760
Uh,

390
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,270
uh,

391
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:48,481
you know,

392
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:48,721
there,

393
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,850
there is just as Vietnam has become,

394
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,241
you know,

395
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:52,074
the major,

396
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,471
Major,

397
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:52,890
sort of,

398
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:53,101
uh,

399
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:55,080
of tourist center and for,

400
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:55,501
you know,

401
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:55,891
oddly,

402
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:56,641
not oddly enough,

403
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:59,610
but I suppose it's good and bringing
these things to an end for lots of

404
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,410
Americans who fought over there.

405
00:10:01,411 --> 00:10:02,244
Uh,

406
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,610
and some of them lost your loss
limit over there to go back.

407
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:05,871
And,

408
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,940
and to put at least
closure on all of that.

409
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,330
Pr Mendez Foss,

410
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,720
who was the new socialist premier,

411
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,380
uh,

412
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,460
succeeded in,

413
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:18,480
in taking France out
of the war in Vietnam.

414
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:18,961
And as you know,

415
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:21,690
he would be successful with a very
less successful and try to convince the

416
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:24,090
French to direct milk as opposed to wine,

417
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,650
a hopeless task.

418
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:25,830
And,

419
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,400
and,

420
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:26,611
uh,

421
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:27,121
he,

422
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:27,540
uh,

423
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,100
without question became the most,

424
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,353
uh,

425
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,220
you know,

426
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:31,410
the,

427
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,080
the most eminent French politician,

428
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,471
uh,

429
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:35,310
not to,

430
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:35,491
uh,

431
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:36,030
hold,

432
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,630
uh,

433
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,470
not to hold,

434
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,304
um,

435
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:38,880
uh,

436
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,601
power as,

437
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:39,961
as,

438
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:40,794
as president,

439
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,000
uh,

440
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,833
in France.

441
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,620
Did you a convention that year,

442
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,150
a frantic green to divide Vietnam
into two states on North Vietnam,

443
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,570
uh,

444
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,180
became a communist regime led by hace men.

445
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:51,990
Uh,

446
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,460
the capital of Hanoi and South Vietnam
became a republic run by a success

447
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,271
succession.

448
00:10:57,271 --> 00:10:59,310
I think it's fair to say
a pretty corrupt leaders,

449
00:10:59,550 --> 00:10:59,701
uh,

450
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,190
who carried out a u s,

451
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:01,710
uh,

452
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,543
policy,

453
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:02,911
uh,

454
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:04,890
in exchange for,

455
00:11:04,891 --> 00:11:05,724
um,

456
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,170
for a free hand,

457
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,010
uh,

458
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:08,843
in,

459
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,480
uh,

460
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:09,810
in,

461
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,950
in all of that.

462
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,143
Now,

463
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,320
one thing that was going
on behind all of that,

464
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:16,800
uh,

465
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,800
is the dissatisfaction of the army,

466
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,210
uh,

467
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:25,800
with what happened in
Vietnam now because the army,

468
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:26,963
which had been,

469
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,073
uh,

470
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,000
emerged from World War One,

471
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,280
victorious,

472
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:37,020
but ultimately France was less
powerful than Germany in defeat.

473
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,810
Germany had been in defeat
France and victory was less,

474
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,830
less powerful.

475
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,550
Uh,

476
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,730
had been defeated and many officers,

477
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,450
uh,

478
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:45,931
uh,

479
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:49,440
argued that it was the
collapse of the homefront that,

480
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,313
uh,

481
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,960
federal brought this about.

482
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,920
And if they had been,

483
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:53,991
uh,

484
00:11:53,991 --> 00:11:56,770
actively by a over the long run,

485
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:59,200
if enough resources had been thrown in,

486
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,010
then,

487
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:00,250
uh,

488
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,510
victory could be achieved.

489
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,140
Now,

490
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:07,140
if that doesn't sound like Vietnam in
the late 1960s and early 1970s a time

491
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:07,991
that,

492
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:08,261
that,

493
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:08,770
uh,

494
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,540
nobody in this room except two of us,

495
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:10,980
uh,

496
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,813
I remember,

497
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:12,550
uh,

498
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:17,140
cause that's exactly the same scenario
and it's exactly the same scenario now,

499
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:17,530
but that,

500
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,221
that's another,

501
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:18,820
uh,

502
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,360
uh,

503
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,530
that's another matter.

504
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,280
Um,

505
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,120
and so,

506
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:22,954
um,

507
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,700
therefore a France gets out of Vietnam.

508
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,450
And,

509
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:28,840
uh,

510
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,860
one of the things that happened,

511
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:30,520
by the way,

512
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,390
my friend Mark Lawrence,

513
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:32,620
it's an excellent book on this,

514
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:35,080
is that already that the French and the,

515
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:35,820
and,

516
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,870
and the British and the late 1940s,

517
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:39,320
we're getting the IC.

518
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:39,850
Uh,

519
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,720
we're getting the,

520
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,650
uh,

521
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,590
getting the Americans to
kind of do what they wanted.

522
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:45,670
But what happens then is,

523
00:12:45,671 --> 00:12:46,504
is that when,

524
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:46,751
you know,

525
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:47,830
when the French are gone,

526
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,290
uh,

527
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:48,940
then,

528
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,130
uh,

529
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,060
the communist insurgency in the north and,

530
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:51,241
and,

531
00:12:51,241 --> 00:12:52,960
and the Viet Cong in the south,

532
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:53,680
uh,

533
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,640
lead to,

534
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:54,941
uh,

535
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,670
this bloody a series of,

536
00:12:57,671 --> 00:12:58,020
of,

537
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,630
uh,

538
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,740
of just horrible years in which so many
Americans and so many Vietnamese died.

539
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:05,380
And they are a commemorated by my,

540
00:13:05,381 --> 00:13:06,650
I Mulind some islands,

541
00:13:06,651 --> 00:13:07,060
uh,

542
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,470
uh,

543
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,380
a wall in,

544
00:13:08,381 --> 00:13:08,831
in,

545
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:09,664
um,

546
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:10,301
uh,

547
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:10,471
in,

548
00:13:10,471 --> 00:13:11,350
in Washington,

549
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,131
uh,

550
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:13,240
with their names on it.

551
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,440
And,

552
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,273
um,

553
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,301
that,

554
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:20,650
I mean that you can remember
those scenes of the frantic,

555
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,401
frantic,

556
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,151
and when the,

557
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:22,451
you know,

558
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:24,170
the healer copters or are,

559
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,560
are pulling off the,

560
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:26,231
the well,

561
00:13:26,231 --> 00:13:26,850
uh,

562
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:26,980
uh,

563
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,320
the well healed and the
well connected from,

564
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:29,800
uh,

565
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:29,891
uh,

566
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:31,150
from Saigon and the,

567
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:31,381
in the,

568
00:13:31,381 --> 00:13:32,380
in the very end.

569
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,840
And it was a lesson that was,

570
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,840
uh,

571
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,860
that was not,

572
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:36,611
there was not,

573
00:13:36,611 --> 00:13:37,540
that was not learned.

574
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,051
And,

575
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:38,710
uh,

576
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,560
sometimes that's the way that things go,

577
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,500
but that was nothing compared to,

578
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,490
uh,

579
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,200
to,

580
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,650
uh,

581
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:46,900
uh,

582
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,733
Algeria.

583
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,060
Um,

584
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,230
that was nothing at all.

585
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,350
And one of the big differences why,

586
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:58,950
what happened in North Africa to above
all in Algeria occurred is that Vietnam

587
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,070
for all of the residuals
of French architecture,

588
00:14:05,071 --> 00:14:05,470
uh,

589
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:05,651
you know,

590
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:06,580
building a,

591
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:10,960
a cathedrals and opera houses
along French architectural lines.

592
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:12,720
There's a wonderful book
by a woman called Winland,

593
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,130
right about imperial architecture.

594
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:15,821
I,

595
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,260
and there were a good
number of French living in,

596
00:14:18,261 --> 00:14:19,120
in Vietnam,

597
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,260
uh,

598
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,093
but that,

599
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,933
uh,

600
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,420
Vietnam was not a settlement colony.

601
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:25,871
Uh,

602
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:26,531
the way that,

603
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:27,011
for example,

604
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:29,320
Australia and New Zealand had been in the,

605
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:30,610
in the British empire.

606
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:31,840
Um,

607
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,600
but Algeria was,

608
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,560
and so was,

609
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,090
uh,

610
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:36,340
uh,

611
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,140
Morocco and North Africa,

612
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,610
uh,

613
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:38,931
and,

614
00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:39,100
uh,

615
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,200
Tunisia where settlement colonies,

616
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,530
all sorts of people
live there from France.

617
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,480
And they were called cool.

618
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,970
We're settlers basically.

619
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,750
And their nicknames were the PM.

620
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,603
Why Pa?

621
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,360
Wow.

622
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,200
The Blackfeet.

623
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,020
And there are several interpretations.

624
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:57,710
Uh,

625
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,590
maybe Brian can a illuminated us,

626
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,520
but sometimes they're called black feet.

627
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:01,970
Uh,

628
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,170
because of the boots,

629
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:03,690
uh,

630
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:08,690
that the army soldiers a war or because
it was thought that if they walked over

631
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:10,490
the burning sands of,

632
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,210
of,

633
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,170
of the Sahara,

634
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:12,770
uh,

635
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:12,981
you know,

636
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:16,880
that their feet would be burned
and therefore become a newer,

637
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,020
uh,

638
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,030
but they were settlers.

639
00:15:20,031 --> 00:15:23,540
They were people who had been there
in many cases for generations and

640
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,374
generations.

641
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:24,771
Now,

642
00:15:24,771 --> 00:15:25,520
Algeria,

643
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,720
as Charles told you,

644
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,770
and you already know,

645
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,191
uh,

646
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:30,590
was first conquered in 1830,

647
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:31,310
uh,

648
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:31,840
uh,

649
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,340
uh,

650
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,040
Jay Algiers falls,

651
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,371
uh,

652
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:34,780
in,

653
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,090
uh,

654
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:35,901
in June,

655
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,250
end of June or early July,

656
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:38,084
I can't remember which,

657
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,541
18,

658
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,230
30.

659
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:39,531
Uh,

660
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:40,940
and it's pacified.

661
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,511
That is,

662
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:41,750
you know,

663
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,010
lots of people are slaughtered,

664
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,341
uh,

665
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:44,210
over the next,

666
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:44,580
uh,

667
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:44,931
uh,

668
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:45,764
decades,

669
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:46,580
uh,

670
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,640
in 1851 after the insurgency,

671
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,000
uh,

672
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,833
to defend,

673
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:51,231
uh,

674
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:54,530
the democratic and social republic
against this and before this course.

675
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,400
But it's still important,

676
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,130
uh,

677
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,460
against the coup d'etat of,

678
00:15:58,461 --> 00:15:59,930
of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte,

679
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:01,340
who became Napoleon third.

680
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,750
Many of the people who were arrested
and put on trial court martialled

681
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:10,730
essentially before what they call mixed
commissions were sent to Algeria either,

682
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,270
uh,

683
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,520
as prisoners in Algeria,

684
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:14,570
uh,

685
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,170
uh,

686
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,300
or just simply kicked out.

687
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:22,330
And then in a whole variety of ways where
a essentially allowed to take lands to

688
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:25,920
be gay that belonged to,

689
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,500
uh,

690
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:26,900
uh,

691
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,090
the Arab and Berber populations.

692
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:29,900
Uh,

693
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,531
and,

694
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:30,891
uh,

695
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:32,210
therefore they are there.

696
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,290
Um,

697
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:38,120
and one of the things about imperialism
is that this sort of social imperialism

698
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:38,270
that,

699
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,970
that Algeria was sort
of a safety valve that,

700
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,181
you know,

701
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:45,080
people who couldn't find work
or couldn't survive often,

702
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:45,590
you know,

703
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,850
when to Algeria because there,

704
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,290
it was sort of like the far west,

705
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,210
the image of the far west and the u acids.

706
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,830
There is a place you can get land,

707
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,221
you know,

708
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:52,731
you can get,

709
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:53,120
uh,

710
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,630
you know,

711
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:53,871
uh,

712
00:16:53,871 --> 00:16:54,530
you can,

713
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,190
uh,

714
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:55,970
uh,

715
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,320
plant vineyards.

716
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:57,511
Uh,

717
00:16:57,511 --> 00:16:59,330
you can plant fruit and,

718
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,650
and you will have a life,

719
00:17:00,651 --> 00:17:03,980
you could buy a cafe and
you will have a life.

720
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,400
And so it was much easier to get out of
Vietnam because you didn't have a lot of

721
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,020
French people living in Vietnam.

722
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,430
And many of the people,

723
00:17:10,431 --> 00:17:10,940
uh,

724
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,181
uh,

725
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:11,720
in,

726
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,290
uh,

727
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,220
in Algeria,

728
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:16,090
I did not want the French to pull out a,

729
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,560
they associated the
empire with their lives.

730
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:20,000
They were French in Algeria,

731
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:20,391
as you know,

732
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:21,224
from reading chips,

733
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:21,621
uh,

734
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:22,071
books.

735
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:22,701
How or why this book,

736
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:23,301
who's retiring,

737
00:17:23,301 --> 00:17:24,560
he's just retiring as a party for him,

738
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:26,000
I think today at the
University of Melbourne,

739
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,133
um,

740
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:27,820
uh,

741
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,280
that,

742
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,760
that,

743
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:28,971
you know,

744
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:29,211
they,

745
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:29,781
they were,

746
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:30,860
I lost my sentence there,

747
00:17:30,861 --> 00:17:31,790
but they were,

748
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:32,624
uh,

749
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,210
they were there and their
empire was their lives.

750
00:17:35,211 --> 00:17:36,620
The French empire was,

751
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,160
uh,

752
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,390
was their lives.

753
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,110
Um,

754
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,980
and so,

755
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:40,221
uh,

756
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:44,120
you got a 1 million French,

757
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,930
uh,

758
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,100
originally French,

759
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:46,700
uh,

760
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,450
people,

761
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:47,780
uh,

762
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,500
living in Algeria.

763
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:54,360
You have 200,000 in Tunisia and
you have 300,000 in Morocco.

764
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:55,440
Um,

765
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,820
and so they poured

766
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,690
money into their cafes,

767
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:01,090
uh,

768
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,840
in an LG I in Algiers,

769
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,520
um,

770
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:04,650
uh,

771
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,460
into,

772
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:05,970
uh,

773
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:10,230
their farms into their
economic activities.

774
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,840
And they were there,

775
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,430
some of them were very wealthy,

776
00:18:14,431 --> 00:18:15,570
big land owners.

777
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:17,100
They were called the goalpost tall,

778
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:17,461
you know,

779
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:18,211
the big guys,

780
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:19,020
sort of,

781
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,620
uh,

782
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,850
and they,

783
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:21,570
uh,

784
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,381
were determined that,

785
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:24,030
that France would stay in Algeria.

786
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,730
Algeria was France French,

787
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,350
or they were opposed by the fl and the
frog deliberate [inaudible] Nasional,

788
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,010
uh,

789
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:32,940
which was,

790
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,893
uh,

791
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,210
very similar to the Viet Cong,

792
00:18:35,211 --> 00:18:36,170
the Viet men,

793
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:36,421
uh,

794
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:36,970
in,

795
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:37,800
um,

796
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,580
uh,

797
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,870
in Vietnam.

798
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,283
Um,

799
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,290
and the resistance was also very,

800
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:43,860
uh,

801
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,780
as one would reasonably expect,

802
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,470
uh,

803
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,610
with Islam,

804
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,340
with,

805
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:48,510
uh,

806
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,340
the Muslim,

807
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:49,680
uh,

808
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,513
world.

809
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:50,970
Um,

810
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,970
three events in 1956 harden the lines
between the [inaudible] that is the

811
00:18:57,241 --> 00:18:58,074
settlers,

812
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:58,651
uh,

813
00:18:58,651 --> 00:18:59,430
and,

814
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,100
uh,

815
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,670
[inaudible] fighting for independence.

816
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,000
On the February 6th,

817
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:08,310
the mob in Algiers and greeted the
French premiere who's called Muhly,

818
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,320
uh,

819
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:09,550
m,

820
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:09,661
O,

821
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:09,841
l,

822
00:19:09,841 --> 00:19:10,021
l,

823
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:10,920
e t a,

824
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:11,790
and his choice,

825
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,211
uh,

826
00:19:12,211 --> 00:19:12,850
for,

827
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:13,340
uh,

828
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:13,560
uh,

829
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,820
Governor General,

830
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:15,450
uh,

831
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:20,070
who was considered by the
Colo to be to pro Arab,

832
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,840
and they greet him with rotten eggs,

833
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,470
uh,

834
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,550
and with,

835
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:23,931
uh,

836
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:24,121
uh,

837
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:24,990
tomatoes.

838
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:25,500
Uh,

839
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,500
and it's a very nasty scene and moldy
capitulates and appoints a socialist,

840
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:31,660
uh,

841
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:31,921
uh,

842
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:32,420
more,

843
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:32,880
uh,

844
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,740
strident on,

845
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:35,630
on the issue of holding onto Algeria,

846
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,360
uh,

847
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,040
as governor general.

848
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,353
Um,

849
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,980
in October,

850
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:41,441
uh,

851
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:42,570
in 1956,

852
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:47,210
there's a conference between the Saltin
of Morocco and the leader of the Flna

853
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,660
leader of the FLN.

854
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,980
In Tunisia.

855
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:50,340
There's,

856
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:50,820
there's,

857
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,240
uh,

858
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,320
outrage in,

859
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:52,950
uh,

860
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,240
the French right wing,

861
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,200
a press.

862
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,020
And so a French authorities had,

863
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:58,411
uh,

864
00:19:58,411 --> 00:20:00,410
the most important
delegate at this meeting.

865
00:20:00,411 --> 00:20:01,590
A guy called Ben Bella,

866
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:02,550
who is still alive.

867
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:03,384
B E N,

868
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:03,751
B,

869
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:03,961
e,

870
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:04,170
l.

871
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:04,381
L,

872
00:20:04,381 --> 00:20:04,561
a.

873
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:06,150
I just looked the other day to see a,

874
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:07,620
and I think he's still alive.

875
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:08,880
He was born in something like 19,

876
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:09,661
19,

877
00:20:09,661 --> 00:20:10,980
if I remember correctly.

878
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,110
They have him kidnapped,

879
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:13,890
uh,

880
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,560
and put in a jail near Paris.

881
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:16,921
Uh,

882
00:20:16,921 --> 00:20:17,250
it,

883
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:17,850
the,

884
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:18,211
uh,

885
00:20:18,211 --> 00:20:22,890
they began to repress critics of this
rather bold and totally illegal act,

886
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,640
uh,

887
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,850
and launch a and C's books that are,

888
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:27,121
uh,

889
00:20:27,121 --> 00:20:27,880
against,

890
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,490
um,

891
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,790
against this movement.

892
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,270
And then in November,

893
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,340
as some of you know,

894
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,150
uh,

895
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:37,050
the French government
participates in the whole,

896
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,740
um,

897
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:37,861
uh,

898
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,170
Suez Canal mess,

899
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:40,500
uh,

900
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,910
in part because,

901
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:42,271
uh,

902
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:43,051
Egypt,

903
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:45,270
and we'll see this in a minute,

904
00:20:45,271 --> 00:20:46,260
at least briefly,

905
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:46,900
uh,

906
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,640
was an important part of,

907
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:49,120
of,

908
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,511
of,

909
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:50,200
uh,

910
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,850
of,

911
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,160
uh,

912
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,980
generating a sympathy for,

913
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,220
uh,

914
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,120
the Algerian,

915
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,690
uh,

916
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,523
national,

917
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:56,681
uh,

918
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:57,514
resistance,

919
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,180
uh,

920
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,013
movements.

921
00:20:59,230 --> 00:20:59,800
Um,

922
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,440
and,

923
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:00,580
uh,

924
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,810
the British and the French and bay.

925
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,920
There's a cease fire that's,

926
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:03,580
that's for,

927
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,320
that's a forced by,

928
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:05,710
um,

929
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:05,831
uh,

930
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,350
Russia when the Soviet
Union with the aid of,

931
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:08,860
of,

932
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,221
uh,

933
00:21:09,221 --> 00:21:10,720
of the United States.

934
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,171
Uh,

935
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:12,460
and this seems to be another,

936
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,600
a humiliation and what this does
as it begins to harden the lines.

937
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,600
Now the problem with,

938
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:19,901
you know,

939
00:21:19,901 --> 00:21:20,800
with all of this is,

940
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:21,611
is as again,

941
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:22,444
as the army,

942
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,470
um,

943
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:26,200
is that now it looks again
from the point of view of the,

944
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:26,620
of the,

945
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:26,880
the,

946
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,410
the,

947
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:31,690
the high command in the
army that that again,

948
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,290
uh,

949
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,890
the civilians are going to capitulate
and there'll be some humiliating

950
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,580
withdrawal from Algeria as
there had been from Vietnam.

951
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,590
But it's a very different cost,

952
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:41,951
isn't it?

953
00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:46,000
Because you've got a million Frenchmen
in quotes as they see themselves.

954
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:46,210
They know.

955
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,110
They didn't accept the,

956
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:47,411
you know,

957
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:48,370
the Frenchness of,

958
00:21:48,371 --> 00:21:48,531
of,

959
00:21:48,531 --> 00:21:49,390
of the other.

960
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,224
As they saw the,

961
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,390
unfortunately I saw the,

962
00:21:51,391 --> 00:21:51,621
the,

963
00:21:51,621 --> 00:21:56,560
the Arab population is the army
going to be disgraced again now,

964
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,070
um,

965
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,340
the,

966
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:57,760
again,

967
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,200
World War Two and the defeat in
1940 and people could remember that,

968
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:07,290
has to be seen as a background and
the defeat in Vietnam in eight,

969
00:22:07,501 --> 00:22:08,620
in 1958,

970
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:13,621
the average military officer had spent
at least one 30 months tour of duty in

971
00:22:14,111 --> 00:22:15,160
Indochina.

972
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:20,430
And the average military officer had
spent two to four years now Juriah along

973
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:24,610
with a small tour of the occupying,

974
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:24,911
you know,

975
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:28,030
garrisons in West Germany.

976
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,171
But,

977
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:31,180
but support was wavering for the war.

978
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:36,270
Citations for wounded soldiers stopped
appearing in the official journal is

979
00:22:37,391 --> 00:22:38,770
you're now with CCL.

980
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,050
20,000 French soldiers
had died in Vietnam.

981
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:44,860
Uh,

982
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,693
that's a lot.

983
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,840
Um,

984
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,040
9,000,

985
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,720
I had died,

986
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,110
uh,

987
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,900
by 1958 in Algeria.

988
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:58,290
And so there are charges of abandonment
and hatred of the officers of the French

989
00:22:59,410 --> 00:22:59,620
Communist Party,

990
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,870
which seemed to be orchestrating
among other people,

991
00:23:01,871 --> 00:23:03,550
orchestrating and along
with the intellectuals,

992
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,680
opposition to the war.

993
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:10,240
And then there was the issue of torture,

994
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,220
how topical again,

995
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:12,521
uh,

996
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:13,320
in our,

997
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:13,540
uh,

998
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,171
contemporary,

999
00:23:14,171 --> 00:23:16,480
the world in which we lived,

1000
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:17,650
um,

1001
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,570
the army had raised,

1002
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:23,620
revived an old concept of what they
consider to be the real country,

1003
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,510
the true country,

1004
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:26,530
the true France,

1005
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:27,364
if you will,

1006
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,970
representing the real interests of France.

1007
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,010
That is the army.

1008
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:33,850
Uh,

1009
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,683
and,

1010
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,470
uh,

1011
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,303
the,

1012
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,750
the legal country,

1013
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:38,584
which was,

1014
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:38,801
you know,

1015
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:41,080
included some of those people who,

1016
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:41,650
uh,

1017
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:41,921
who,

1018
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:42,880
who opposed them.

1019
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:43,751
Um,

1020
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:44,590
and so,

1021
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,350
um,

1022
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:50,350
within the army and there
begin to be not only a discord,

1023
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,340
but attempts to organize,

1024
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:52,970
uh,

1025
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:56,420
a right wing groups that
became known as the OAS,

1026
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,600
the secret army that eventually tries
to kill Charles de Gaulle himself and

1027
00:24:02,451 --> 00:24:05,150
launches a campaign of terror in France.

1028
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:05,960
Uh,

1029
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,420
and things that,

1030
00:24:07,421 --> 00:24:08,300
that you can read about.

1031
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:09,170
They try a pooch,

1032
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:09,830
uh,

1033
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,340
in,

1034
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:10,720
uh,

1035
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:10,950
in,

1036
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:11,261
in,

1037
00:24:11,261 --> 00:24:12,710
in 1961.

1038
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,500
Sometimes I used to
show this film in here,

1039
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:20,330
but it's the torture scene is too
hard to see and people used to leave.

1040
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:20,931
Uh,

1041
00:24:20,931 --> 00:24:21,651
it's horrible,

1042
00:24:21,651 --> 00:24:24,530
but it's one of the great movies made in,

1043
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,070
uh,

1044
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,341
you know,

1045
00:24:25,341 --> 00:24:26,210
in our lifetimes.

1046
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:28,460
It's the battle of Algiers,

1047
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,780
the battle of Algiers.

1048
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,310
Absolutely fantastic.

1049
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:37,040
The scene where the woman with a bomb
goes into a cafe and places the bomb and

1050
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:42,041
looks at families who personally she
has nothing against and she knows that

1051
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:45,770
they're going to blow up and be killed.

1052
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,710
It's one of the great scenes in,

1053
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,390
uh,

1054
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:48,840
in,

1055
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,673
in film,

1056
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:50,481
uh,

1057
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:50,840
and it,

1058
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,370
you think it's a documentary,

1059
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,533
but it's not.

1060
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,160
And this is about the French
war against the Cosby,

1061
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,373
against the,

1062
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,850
the Algerian quarters.

1063
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,271
Uh,

1064
00:24:59,271 --> 00:25:00,590
and these two worlds,

1065
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,580
the French Cologne worlds
and the cafes of the Cologne,

1066
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:06,050
their extension would
be the port of mouth,

1067
00:25:06,051 --> 00:25:08,360
say the old port of Maasais and,

1068
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,170
uh,

1069
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,060
and the world of people,

1070
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:11,391
uh,

1071
00:25:11,391 --> 00:25:12,720
in the casbah.

1072
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,480
And so what the military wants
to do is they want to break,

1073
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,500
uh,

1074
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,680
the pair of the Political
Military Organization of,

1075
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:22,970
of the insurgence.

1076
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:27,350
And they want to do this
through state terror.

1077
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:31,430
So you have the terror of those who
are accused of being terrorists,

1078
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:36,110
who are blowing up cafes as the
independence movement did in,

1079
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,340
in Vietnam.

1080
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,810
And the state,

1081
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:39,630
uh,

1082
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:39,770
uh,

1083
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:42,860
terror involving a systematic torture,

1084
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,760
the murder,

1085
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,230
the slaughter of,

1086
00:25:45,231 --> 00:25:45,740
of,

1087
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,131
uh,

1088
00:25:46,131 --> 00:25:46,964
a very,

1089
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,150
uh,

1090
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,080
ordinary people,

1091
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:49,760
many of whom had nothing
to do with anything.

1092
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,640
And their response is repression

1093
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:54,950
first,

1094
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:55,820
second.

1095
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,910
This is from a book by Chillner,

1096
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,251
I think.

1097
00:25:58,251 --> 00:25:58,971
I can't remember.

1098
00:25:58,971 --> 00:26:00,050
He lists these things,

1099
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,740
uh,

1100
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,573
on the army.

1101
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,510
Uh,

1102
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,670
a totalitarian,

1103
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,720
a technique of organization,

1104
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,651
a promising,

1105
00:26:06,651 --> 00:26:08,000
some reform,

1106
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,710
but basically just organizing,

1107
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,250
uh,

1108
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:10,420
uh,

1109
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,170
a basically a military state,

1110
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:12,890
uh,

1111
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:15,440
the political activism of the army,

1112
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:16,110
thus,

1113
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:16,730
uh,

1114
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,140
the Oh Aas,

1115
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,010
uh,

1116
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:24,010
and working on the French population
as a whole to argue that those who are

1117
00:26:24,861 --> 00:26:29,861
against these measures being taken by
the French army in the name of France are

1118
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,450
disloyal and do not represent,

1119
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:32,980
uh,

1120
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,180
the,

1121
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,400
the true France,

1122
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,950
the real France as they,

1123
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:37,250
uh,

1124
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,083
they see it.

1125
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:38,870
Um,

1126
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:42,350
and so the cycle of violence,

1127
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:42,920
uh,

1128
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,590
is,

1129
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:43,920
uh,

1130
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,753
totally,

1131
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:45,440
uh,

1132
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,640
I is totally untenable.

1133
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,570
And,

1134
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,280
um,

1135
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:49,830
oh,

1136
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,071
you know,

1137
00:26:50,071 --> 00:26:50,280
what?

1138
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,480
The intellectuals,

1139
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:51,901
uh,

1140
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:52,590
get,

1141
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:52,830
uh,

1142
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,663
involved,

1143
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:54,840
um,

1144
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:54,991
uh,

1145
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:56,640
come to add about outcome.

1146
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,181
You and,

1147
00:26:57,181 --> 00:26:58,140
and lots of others,

1148
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,080
uh,

1149
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,100
organized opposition to the torture.

1150
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:02,840
Ah,

1151
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,090
AH,

1152
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:03,601
the two,

1153
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:06,180
this repression to these mass murderers,

1154
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:06,781
I,

1155
00:27:06,781 --> 00:27:07,380
and,

1156
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:07,970
uh,

1157
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:08,100
uh,

1158
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,933
the stakes,

1159
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,211
uh,

1160
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,080
increase,

1161
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:10,560
uh,

1162
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,430
dramatically.

1163
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,590
I N it is,

1164
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,220
um,

1165
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:14,461
yeah,

1166
00:27:14,461 --> 00:27:14,791
it,

1167
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:15,400
it is,

1168
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:15,770
uh,

1169
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:16,603
a total,

1170
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,430
uh,

1171
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,180
total,

1172
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:18,271
uh,

1173
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:18,870
chaos.

1174
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:19,590
Can you,

1175
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,390
who was born in Algeria,

1176
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:22,643
um,

1177
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:27,390
described the difficult choices for
French families who lived in Algeria.

1178
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,070
Uh,

1179
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,231
you know,

1180
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:33,231
the vast majority were not in
favor of mass murder and torture.

1181
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,260
Uh,

1182
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:38,250
he said if he was given the choice
between justice and his mother,

1183
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,530
he would take his mother.

1184
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,940
But lots of people,

1185
00:27:44,941 --> 00:27:45,810
there were again,

1186
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:49,980
these cafe owners where people of
modest means who are simply caught,

1187
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:50,670
uh,

1188
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,330
in,

1189
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:51,930
uh,

1190
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:52,350
you know,

1191
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,710
in the middle of all of this now,

1192
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,943
ah,

1193
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,660
in on March 13th,

1194
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,170
1958,

1195
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:05,870
a protest demonstration
by French settlers,

1196
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:10,930
the Cola in Algiers turned into a
military red led insurrection against the

1197
00:28:12,321 --> 00:28:13,220
French government,

1198
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,990
a committee of public safety,

1199
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,340
but not a left wing one,

1200
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,720
but a right wing one,

1201
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,430
uh,

1202
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,263
of rightest,

1203
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:19,611
uh,

1204
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:21,050
seized power.

1205
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,130
Ah,

1206
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:22,550
Eh,

1207
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,810
this is in Algeria.

1208
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,080
And there was a distinct possibility
of a military coup d'etat in France.

1209
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:32,210
I have a friend called Murray scalp
down who's been in the ministry.

1210
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:32,991
He's now retired,

1211
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:34,670
but as an academic.

1212
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,410
And when he was in the
army back in those days,

1213
00:28:36,411 --> 00:28:38,060
he was in Dijon and they had,

1214
00:28:38,061 --> 00:28:40,430
or he was in the air
force and he had that,

1215
00:28:40,431 --> 00:28:43,960
they were told to park planes
on the runways in digital.

1216
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:44,350
Uh,

1217
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:47,270
and this happened in very many
places in France because it was,

1218
00:28:47,271 --> 00:28:51,680
it seemed quite likely that the Aha that
is the French paratroopers were going

1219
00:28:51,681 --> 00:28:54,860
to be landing and that there
would be civil war in France,

1220
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:55,130
uh,

1221
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,210
between the army.

1222
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:56,900
Uh,

1223
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,960
and those army elements that
didn't go along with all of this.

1224
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,250
And those,

1225
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:01,750
uh,

1226
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:01,970
you know,

1227
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,050
intellectuals and the,

1228
00:29:03,051 --> 00:29:05,660
and the communists and the Socialists
and all these other people,

1229
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:09,410
though a lot of the socialists were
quite ambivalent about all of this.

1230
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,100
No.

1231
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:15,100
Charles de Gaulle who had gone off to
his small house in a place called Colon

1232
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:15,841
Bay,

1233
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:16,960
and they do a Zig Lee's,

1234
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:17,150
uh,

1235
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,230
after he didn't get his way,

1236
00:29:18,231 --> 00:29:19,064
as you know,

1237
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:19,730
uh,

1238
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,061
uh,

1239
00:29:20,061 --> 00:29:22,450
right after a world war two,

1240
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:26,510
I announced that he was
ready to serve France again.

1241
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:27,740
Uh,

1242
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,740
many politicians who had real reasons
to fear a seizure of power by the

1243
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:34,184
military.

1244
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:34,700
Uh,

1245
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:39,700
they believe that only the towering
figure of Charles de Gaulle could save

1246
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:40,723
France.

1247
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,410
And on May 29th,

1248
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:49,410
1958 present [inaudible] c o t y
perfume appointed to Gaul premier,

1249
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,370
uh,

1250
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,020
moved,

1251
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,180
uh,

1252
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:52,600
point,

1253
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:52,751
uh,

1254
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:55,120
approved by the National
Assembly in early June.

1255
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,710
He accepted,

1256
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,150
uh,

1257
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:03,150
but on condition that he could rule for
by emergency to cre for six months and

1258
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:06,760
then ask the nation to
approve a new constitution.

1259
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:07,691
Now,

1260
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:12,040
de Gaulle had always insisted that France
needed a stronger executive authority

1261
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,870
that the third republic I had
fallen basically because no,

1262
00:30:16,871 --> 00:30:21,280
there weren't any strong leaders to make
what he considered the right decisions

1263
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:22,720
in the 1930s.

1264
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,080
But because of the fear of
Caesar Ism of Napoleon's,

1265
00:30:26,081 --> 00:30:27,010
of boodle and Jay,

1266
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:32,160
and have these kinds of strong types
or a Vichy for that matter of Peyto,

1267
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:32,920
uh,

1268
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,670
the president of France
had very little power.

1269
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,593
Power remained,

1270
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,430
remained in the chamber,

1271
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,060
uh,

1272
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,241
uh,

1273
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:42,160
in the Chamber of Deputies.

1274
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,390
Now the right,

1275
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:47,680
including the army was
delighted to have de Gaulle,

1276
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,640
the big guy,

1277
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:49,360
uh,

1278
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,360
serving in what they assumed would be
a more or less permanent or lengthy

1279
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:00,240
capacity until a new constitution with
a strong executive authority could be

1280
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:00,850
written.

1281
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,500
He was one of theirs.

1282
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,310
He was wounded on a bridge and
[inaudible] not the two French denom,

1283
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:07,780
but dino in a,

1284
00:31:07,781 --> 00:31:08,620
with a t in,

1285
00:31:08,621 --> 00:31:09,454
in Belgium,

1286
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,270
uh,

1287
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,640
at the very beginning of war war two,

1288
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,480
uh,

1289
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,181
he was born,

1290
00:31:14,181 --> 00:31:16,480
had been born in the
fortress town of Lean,

1291
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,340
not too far away from,

1292
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:18,860
uh,

1293
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,000
uh,

1294
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
the big garrisons and the big fort there
and surely to Gaul would want Algeria

1295
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,660
to remain,

1296
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,410
uh,

1297
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:26,920
uh,

1298
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,920
to remain French would need now the new
constitution increase the authority of

1299
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:33,850
the president.

1300
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,080
It was written by Michelle deploy.

1301
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:35,261
Hey,

1302
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:35,741
by the way,

1303
00:31:35,741 --> 00:31:37,090
whose son is a very important,

1304
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:37,780
uh,

1305
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,230
uh,

1306
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,080
gall is oil,

1307
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,360
no stone called Gaullist anymore,

1308
00:31:40,361 --> 00:31:40,721
but,

1309
00:31:40,721 --> 00:31:41,420
um,

1310
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:41,680
uh,

1311
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,720
on paid leader in,

1312
00:31:42,721 --> 00:31:43,181
in France.

1313
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:46,190
Now what it did is it set it,

1314
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:50,410
set the term of the
presidency at seven years,

1315
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,970
it's gone back to five now and
ended the revolving door ministries,

1316
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,073
uh,

1317
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,160
and presence under the
Fifth Republic could,

1318
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:58,630
uh,

1319
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,050
now,

1320
00:31:59,050 --> 00:31:59,231
you know,

1321
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:00,700
conduct foreign policy.

1322
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:04,780
They appoint prime ministers and
they can dissolve parliament.

1323
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:05,381
Uh,

1324
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,730
in September,

1325
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:06,731
1958,

1326
00:32:06,731 --> 00:32:11,170
80% of the population approve the
constitution of the fifth republic.

1327
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,450
But what about Algeria?

1328
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:18,640
Now the Algerian situation was different
than any other war of independence that

1329
00:32:18,641 --> 00:32:19,780
had been fought before.

1330
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,200
And there was an internationalization of
that war is a brilliant book on this by

1331
00:32:25,301 --> 00:32:26,590
a guy called Matthew Connolly,

1332
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:27,041
who was a,

1333
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:27,970
who teaches at Columbia,

1334
00:32:27,971 --> 00:32:29,650
who was a graduate student here.

1335
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:30,980
And what the,

1336
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:31,341
the,

1337
00:32:31,341 --> 00:32:31,710
the,

1338
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:34,540
the National Liberation Front
in Algeria was able to do,

1339
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,910
was to mobilize newspapers,

1340
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,260
uh,

1341
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,280
of the left end of the center.

1342
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:39,950
Uh,

1343
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:44,950
and to use the sort of publicity
machine to excite worldwide attention,

1344
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:46,371
uh,

1345
00:32:46,371 --> 00:32:47,210
against,

1346
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,433
uh,

1347
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,400
against torture,

1348
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,560
against the abuses of civilian.

1349
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:57,190
There was an internet nationalization
of that war and this goes a long way to

1350
00:32:57,261 --> 00:32:58,094
try to,

1351
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:58,340
uh,

1352
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,710
help the situation of the,

1353
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:03,170
of the rebels of the surgeons in,

1354
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:03,800
uh,

1355
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,940
in Algeria.

1356
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:05,920
Now.

1357
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,753
Um,

1358
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,930
so what's he going to do?

1359
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,280
And so on the 4th of June,

1360
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,540
1958,

1361
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,850
he goes to LGS and he's welcomed by,

1362
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,110
by the throngs,

1363
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,550
not the Algerians,

1364
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,381
but the cone.

1365
00:33:17,381 --> 00:33:17,590
Oh,

1366
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,423
by the way,

1367
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,650
the Harkema the,

1368
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:20,720
the hockey two names.

1369
00:33:20,721 --> 00:33:25,610
I need to explain the hierarchy where
the Algerians who fought for the French

1370
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:29,030
and if they stayed in
Algeria after the war,

1371
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,080
they are toast.

1372
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,380
And so they,

1373
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,001
and then the French,

1374
00:33:32,001 --> 00:33:35,600
what they did is they brought them back
and put them in a not really internment

1375
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:35,991
camps,

1376
00:33:35,991 --> 00:33:38,300
but sort of they put them into uh,

1377
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,280
into areas,

1378
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:42,020
can reserved areas for them.

1379
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,690
And of course their relations with
other Algerians are not very good.

1380
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:45,081
Uh,

1381
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:47,120
and it's a very awkward situation.

1382
00:33:47,121 --> 00:33:48,490
The other name here is my sue,

1383
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,360
who is one of the chief torturers,

1384
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:50,960
uh,

1385
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,940
in the who just died a couple years ago,

1386
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:53,600
uh,

1387
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,433
in the army.

1388
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:59,060
So he goes to Algeria and he says he
gives his classic speech of noncommittal.

1389
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,980
He told the settlers on the 4th of June,

1390
00:34:00,981 --> 00:34:04,250
1958 I have understood you,

1391
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,950
I know what you have tried to do here,

1392
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:13,010
but he had already decided that the
cost of France continuing the war was to

1393
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:13,191
grow,

1394
00:34:13,191 --> 00:34:14,024
were too great,

1395
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,280
that the war was to decisive.

1396
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:21,410
And he removed many of the generals
responsible for the coup d'etat in Algeria

1397
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:24,350
from their post for somebody
for whom nationalism,

1398
00:34:24,351 --> 00:34:25,550
as we'll see on Wednesday,

1399
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:29,120
underlie underlay his
basic philosophy of life.

1400
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,520
This seemed to be an
astonishing turnaround,

1401
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,240
a stab in the back by a military man.

1402
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,260
And as the Dreyfus affair had revealed,

1403
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:42,670
had revealed in the 1890s and the Vichy
years had confirmed a right wing anti

1404
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:46,730
democratic tradition survived
in the officer Corps Corps.

1405
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,860
And so they felt absolutely betrayed.

1406
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,510
And so the OAS,

1407
00:34:50,511 --> 00:34:51,231
which had already,

1408
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:53,540
but we're already existed in reality,

1409
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,890
they try to kill the gall.

1410
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:59,510
The closest they get a is at
a place called [inaudible]
clay come out outside of

1411
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:01,580
Paris where they machine gun,

1412
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,180
uh,

1413
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,720
his big limousine and they're,

1414
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:04,160
you know,

1415
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,840
20 or 30 bullet holes in there.

1416
00:35:05,841 --> 00:35:08,570
And it's hard to miss a guy
who was her power forward size.

1417
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,290
Uh,

1418
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:09,501
you know,

1419
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:09,891
six,

1420
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:10,311
seven,

1421
00:35:10,311 --> 00:35:10,821
huge,

1422
00:35:10,821 --> 00:35:11,361
huge man,

1423
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:12,950
but he emerges unscathed.

1424
00:35:12,951 --> 00:35:14,540
There was absolutely incredible.

1425
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,640
And the plant bombs in Paris,

1426
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:21,320
this is terrorism to blow up
and to terrorize the population.

1427
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:22,610
The goal assumes,

1428
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,270
uh,

1429
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:23,571
uh,

1430
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:24,380
assumes,

1431
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:24,840
uh,

1432
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,460
uh,

1433
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:28,550
emergency powers again
this time for a year,

1434
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,560
but not in the interest of the army.

1435
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,810
His interest is to pull France.

1436
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,340
This is the ultimate in reality.

1437
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,183
Politique,

1438
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:35,361
uh,

1439
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:40,200
is to pull France out of Algeria and
there's a volt for Algerian independence

1440
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:45,201
held in 1961 in July and 15 million
vote week and 5 million vote no,

1441
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,650
and there's a new attempt in Algeria
by army officers to organize an

1442
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:56,010
insurrection and as soon put put down,

1443
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:56,970
uh,

1444
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,220
and um,

1445
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:58,841
uh,

1446
00:35:58,841 --> 00:36:00,780
Algeria becomes free.

1447
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,730
Now in the last minute.

1448
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,300
That remains me to me that I have left.

1449
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:11,630
One of the things that is interesting
now in the last 20 years is that when the

1450
00:36:12,331 --> 00:36:13,620
national front,

1451
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,230
the right wing party of John,

1452
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,050
now he looked Penn who had
demisse dismissed by the way,

1453
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:22,530
the death camps and the
Holocaust is a minor detail.

1454
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,300
I'm quoting him exactly.

1455
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:29,310
And who applauded the drowning of
immigrants in the San River by his thugs.

1456
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,240
Uh,

1457
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:30,870
when he,

1458
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:35,870
when he first came to the attention
of the world with a see a series of

1459
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:41,961
astonishing electoral victories or at
least a good showings in various places in

1460
00:36:42,151 --> 00:36:42,990
France.

1461
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,590
One of the things that people first
who followed at first noted is that he

1462
00:36:46,591 --> 00:36:51,180
didn't do that well and the tradition
anymore than anywhere else in the more

1463
00:36:51,181 --> 00:36:53,970
traditionally Catholic parts of France.

1464
00:36:53,971 --> 00:36:58,050
That is Brittany or one of the departments
where we had his first big success,

1465
00:36:58,051 --> 00:37:00,080
a near shot two in a
place called [inaudible],

1466
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:03,960
but the places that he
did astoundingly well,

1467
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,560
we're on the Mediterranean
and in the volt clues.

1468
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:10,560
That is where avenue is and our launch.

1469
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,560
Why it's not the,

1470
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:17,370
the large immigrant populations from
North Africa who are voting for somebody

1471
00:37:17,371 --> 00:37:22,290
that wants to drown them or send
them back to where they came from.

1472
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,030
They're not voting for him.

1473
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,260
The people that voted for him
massively are the Cologne,

1474
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,371
the PN.

1475
00:37:29,371 --> 00:37:30,204
Wow.

1476
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,350
Not all of them,

1477
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:36,620
but it was they who had to leave in
1960 and 61 and 62 in many cases,

1478
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:38,101
getting out,

1479
00:37:38,101 --> 00:37:41,520
quick packing up photos,

1480
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,560
whatever they could take
with them in some cases,

1481
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:47,640
extreme cases and going to
France where they bought cafes,

1482
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,170
orange groves,

1483
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:50,203
et cetera.

1484
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,580
And they remembered and they hate it.

1485
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:57,690
And that's what changes did change the
inner dramatic way in area that had

1486
00:37:57,691 --> 00:37:58,770
always been left wing,

1487
00:37:58,771 --> 00:38:00,600
at least since the middle
of the 19th century.

1488
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:04,950
And turns it into the bastion of
for awhile of the National Front.

1489
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,110
And then things got more complicated.

1490
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:10,020
But it went back to these events in,

1491
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:10,411
uh,

1492
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:11,400
in Algeria.

1493
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:15,180
And what happened there
that shaped not only France,

1494
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,040
but movements in other countries.

1495
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,420
See you on Wednesday.
