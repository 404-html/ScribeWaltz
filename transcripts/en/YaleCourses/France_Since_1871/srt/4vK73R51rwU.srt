1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,810
This is a I history of France,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,081
uh,

3
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:06,740
1871 to the present and I'm,

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,540
my name's Mirman and uh,

5
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:13,080
we meet Monday and Wednesday in this room,

6
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:14,130
which is a pretty good room.

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,320
And we the third,

8
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:21,321
the famous third hour to be arranged as
a section a at the moment we have been

9
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,520
assigned 40 aes.

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,301
They'll looking around,

11
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:25,740
we won't need for case,

12
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:26,574
but at the moment,

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,180
uh,

14
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,230
we have [inaudible],

15
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,490
we have Michael [inaudible],

16
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,230
we have a on today,

17
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,880
Yvonne Yvonne level.

18
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,570
And we have a Brian Riley and um,

19
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,090
knowledge of,

20
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,250
of Francher or anything at all about
France is not required in this class at

21
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:44,030
all.

22
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,870
Somebody who had my introductory class,

23
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,920
lots of you haven't,

24
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,610
a couple of you who had the,

25
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:49,980
the first half of this course.

26
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,380
I'm,

27
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,213
most of you haven't.

28
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,310
I'm going of you won't
be here the next day.

29
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:53,851
Uh,

30
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:54,341
that's the,

31
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:54,610
the,

32
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,040
what happens with shopping period.

33
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,040
And then the third day we
see how many folks we have.

34
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,280
We do have for those people who want to
take it a total deletional Fonsi don't

35
00:01:04,561 --> 00:01:04,920
go,

36
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,960
we have a section that's French speaking.

37
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,800
It's an idea that the Chris Miller and
the French department and I came up with

38
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:11,880
in the late nineties,

39
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:13,410
and my old dear friend,

40
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:15,360
Dick broadhead provided the funding.

41
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,740
And what this is,

42
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,830
is that if you want to
take the section in French,

43
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:20,820
uh,

44
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,391
I,

45
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:21,691
you know,

46
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:24,810
you should have about a
equivalent of one 30 I,

47
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:27,330
and the discussions in France
and a couple of the books,

48
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:28,320
I'll talk about them in a minute.

49
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,030
You can read in French,

50
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,190
others you read in English and it's not,

51
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:32,521
you know,

52
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:33,241
it's not a lot.

53
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:34,650
He does a thing where we're,

54
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:34,831
I mean,

55
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:35,061
I'll tell,

56
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:35,551
I'll tell you once,

57
00:01:35,551 --> 00:01:37,620
there was a student in there
who had really fantastic,

58
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:37,980
uh,

59
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,401
French,

60
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:38,731
and I said,

61
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:39,900
why is your French so good?

62
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,250
And the person looked at me and said,

63
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:41,461
well,

64
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:42,690
the maid was from digital,

65
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,040
you know,

66
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,720
and another time somebody
French's are good.

67
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:45,961
And I said,

68
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:46,860
why is your French so good?

69
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:47,071
Well,

70
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:47,400
you know,

71
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,040
mummy used to take us
to Shamani for the pool,

72
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,430
uh,

73
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,520
leave a constant Devad and it's,

74
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,490
you know,

75
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,031
or you know,

76
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,910
our apartment next to the
Turkey feather that was a,

77
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,770
gave me contact with different people.

78
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,730
Um,

79
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,541
and so,

80
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:00,930
uh,

81
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,100
it's not like that.

82
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,620
I assure you it's truly
isn't and you're not,

83
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,690
you're not counted off for,

84
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:07,140
uh,

85
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,321
you know,

86
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:08,850
for errors that you make.

87
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:10,050
And in writing either.

88
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:10,561
I,

89
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:12,720
if you're writing in
French and it really rocks.

90
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,441
Trust me,

91
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:17,280
we've done this for year after year one
year we actually had something like 42

92
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:19,440
people signed up on the
course was much bigger.

93
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,221
Uh,

94
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:22,830
and we thought they all thought they were
getting a free prize or something for

95
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:23,340
signing up.

96
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,031
There were so many of them.

97
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:25,290
We end up with about 32.

98
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,880
We've had a few as eight.

99
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,200
As long as we have five,

100
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:29,034
it will,

101
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,030
it will go.

102
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:30,864
But it's a lot.

103
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,980
It's really fun.

104
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:32,310
And a,

105
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,600
you'll know people around here,

106
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,830
if you're a above a first year student
who have taken this and it really rocks,

107
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,693
it's really great.

108
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,281
Uh,

109
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:41,640
and Brian Riley's going
to going to do this.

110
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:42,960
He's from the French department.

111
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,400
So I would encourage you if you
have a as that kind of interest to,

112
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,210
uh,

113
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:48,810
uh,

114
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,643
to do that,

115
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,503
um,

116
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,660
and you won't regret it.

117
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,850
There's never been anybody
who regretted doing it.

118
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:54,960
Um,

119
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,611
and it's,

120
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:56,640
it's just a lot of fun.

121
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,710
The other sections we'll meet in English,

122
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,670
uh,

123
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,361
and uh,

124
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:01,661
you know,

125
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:04,930
usually what we do in this course as
we offer some nights sections because

126
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:05,950
people are kind of busy.

127
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,151
And so we,

128
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:09,490
there'll be certainly a
section on Wednesday at seven,

129
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,980
certainly one Wednesday at eight.

130
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,090
Uh,

131
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,300
there'll be certainly a,

132
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:14,461
uh,

133
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,294
sections,

134
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:15,520
uh,

135
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,370
Thursday at one 30 and two 30.

136
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,300
And the French section is
tentatively scheduled for,

137
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,723
what did we say?

138
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,120
We said Wednesday at one 30.

139
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,130
It wasn't that it or something like that.

140
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,770
It all shakes down and it is fun.

141
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,071
Now,

142
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:30,340
what,

143
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:30,770
what,

144
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,530
what are you going to do
in the course will be,

145
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:34,960
we have to come with good humor
and that I hope you'll have,

146
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,033
um,

147
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,500
it come to the lectures
and do the reading,

148
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,580
see the films,

149
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,400
which I'll talk about in a
while and go to sections,

150
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,301
uh,

151
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:44,134
and uh,

152
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,990
hopefully participate in sections
and the sections tend to be fun,

153
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,531
uh,

154
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:49,270
in this course.

155
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,201
So,

156
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:50,570
um,

157
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:55,060
so far I know you're dying to know
about midterm and final and those direct

158
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,953
wretched things.

159
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,290
I wouldn't give a midterm because I think
it's a waste of time except we have to

160
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,400
um,

161
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,240
have some sort of,

162
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,450
it gives you an indication how
you're doing in the course.

163
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:05,231
If you screw it up,

164
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:07,300
we don't count it as
much as if you do well.

165
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,320
Um,

166
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,970
and the final is we will give you on the
last day of class the questions for the

167
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:13,804
final,

168
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,960
we give you six questions and we will ask
you on the day of the final to respond

169
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:20,290
to three of those.

170
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:20,981
Our choice,

171
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:23,110
it would be hardly sporting if
you've got to pick the three.

172
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:23,980
Um,

173
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,700
and we also give you an
oral exam option that,

174
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:27,880
uh,

175
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,120
if you want to say not be
here on a Christmas morning,

176
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,810
uh,

177
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,140
taking your last final because
they tend to go to the 23rd,

178
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,070
you can just blow off those days and go
off to Bermuda or go home or do whatever

179
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,440
you do a and take the oral final,

180
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,630
which we used to cheat and
have it during reading period,

181
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:45,580
but they caught onto me
and you can't do that.

182
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,361
So,

183
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:46,691
uh,

184
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:47,830
they frequently catch onto me.

185
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:50,350
But so now we have it on
the first two days of,

186
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:50,651
of,

187
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:51,130
uh,

188
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:51,581
of,

189
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:51,940
uh,

190
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,170
the final exam period.

191
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:54,970
And you sign up for a,

192
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:56,290
it is not an interrogation.

193
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,020
It is a friendly exchange
about the themes of the course.

194
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,310
Most people,

195
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:02,290
particularly in this course do that,

196
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,750
but it's not necessarily
advantage to do it.

197
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:05,584
People who,

198
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,530
this is not the core.

199
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:08,530
If they're doing working
hard on this course,

200
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:09,520
as in the one out of five,

201
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:10,360
they're blowing off,

202
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,200
uh,

203
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,850
then they tend to do that.

204
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,100
And,

205
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,000
and instead of writing for three and a
half hours and getting writing and cramp,

206
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:18,820
and inevitably our final exam
was in that horrible place,

207
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,320
Osborn Hall,

208
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,850
where you're sort of tilting like this,

209
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:25,090
like you're leading out of an airplane
and you sit up there for three and a half

210
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:25,924
damn hours,

211
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,320
you know,

212
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,400
writing your brains out and,

213
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,180
and you can have a sporty
conversation of 25 minutes with,

214
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:31,531
with,

215
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:31,990
uh,

216
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,111
uh,

217
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:34,990
one of the teaching assistants
and you're out of there.

218
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,621
So,

219
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:35,980
uh,

220
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,480
that's what a lot of people do.

221
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:37,950
Fact,

222
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,470
about two thirds of the folks do that
as a very funny stories about those.

223
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:42,760
But now's not the time to do that,

224
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:43,960
especially cause we're being silly.

225
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,170
But most people do.

226
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:45,551
Do,

227
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:45,791
do,

228
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:46,091
do,

229
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:46,560
uh,

230
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:46,920
uh,

231
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,950
a deveer well,

232
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,720
um,

233
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,080
let me tell you little
bit about the reading.

234
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,750
The books are available at,

235
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:53,111
at,

236
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:53,710
uh,

237
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,970
the Yale Bookstore,

238
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:55,481
the store,

239
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:56,261
Barnes and noble.

240
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:56,861
Here you guys,

241
00:05:56,861 --> 00:05:58,380
here's some of the east.

242
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,660
Um,

243
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,140
and the textbook is a good textbook.

244
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:03,651
It's really good.

245
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:04,730
And cultural history.

246
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,430
A guy called a chips sour wine.

247
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,980
Charles sour wine is a buddy of mine from,

248
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:10,280
uh,

249
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,350
lives in Melbourne and Australia.

250
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,370
Um,

251
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:13,910
and,

252
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,330
um,

253
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,163
it's a good book.

254
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,940
And the other books are in their own way,

255
00:06:17,941 --> 00:06:19,760
sort of classics that you'll enjoy.

256
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:20,480
Now,

257
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,111
many of you,

258
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:21,891
if you had French,

259
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:22,431
anything,

260
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:25,460
have read a germy now and if
you haven't read your me now,

261
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,090
uh,

262
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,260
now's your chance to read it.

263
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,100
Uh,

264
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,890
Zola was one of the first
great naturalist writers,

265
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,180
and he would go up to the north,

266
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,470
to the Amazon,

267
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,710
to the minds of Anzac up
here in the north of France.

268
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,611
Uh,

269
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:40,730
and he would go down in the
minds and see how people work.

270
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,650
He would see how 15 year old girls
worked in the mine Katrine who grows up,

271
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,520
uh,

272
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:46,731
uh,

273
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:48,200
rather quickly in the mines.

274
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,430
And it's a,

275
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:50,061
as your me now,

276
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:51,260
it means the budding,

277
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,771
it's a,

278
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:56,240
it's a reference to a calendar of the
French revolution and also kind of implies

279
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:57,074
hope.

280
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,770
And it's about what happens when
people try to mobilize these,

281
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,060
these broad guy.

282
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,370
Come on,

283
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:02,650
hey,

284
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:02,811
you know,

285
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:03,051
these,

286
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:04,040
these workers in,

287
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:04,311
in,

288
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:04,641
in,

289
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:05,090
uh,

290
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:05,241
uh,

291
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:05,461
in,

292
00:07:05,461 --> 00:07:05,630
in,

293
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,441
in the minds.

294
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:07,550
And if you've never read it,

295
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:07,701
I mean,

296
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:08,121
it's a great,

297
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:08,450
great,

298
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:08,960
uh,

299
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,081
uh,

300
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:09,850
novel.

301
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,310
Um,

302
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,880
a life of her own is a book that
I became obsessed with about,

303
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:14,714
uh,

304
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,850
all about five or six years ago.

305
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:17,763
Um,

306
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,960
Emily Carr was born in abject poverty
in the High Alps and the oats out,

307
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:23,810
uh,

308
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,330
near,

309
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:24,480
uh,

310
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,730
the pop them all of a
and the oils out there,

311
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,870
a GAAP up really high
in the mountains here.

312
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:30,920
And,

313
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,430
um,

314
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,610
she became a school teacher as a common,

315
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:38,630
sort of a means of social ascension
for poor person from a village.

316
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:40,280
He was born right near the Italian border,

317
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:41,540
but just an abject poverty.

318
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:45,320
She married an anarchist
from the department of the
l Dash where we happen to

319
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:48,890
live or at least be legally residents
and spend much of our time down here.

320
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,890
And she moved from one school to the next.

321
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,600
And when she was a very old lady,

322
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:54,381
um,

323
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:56,840
she led a demonstration to try to protect,

324
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:57,830
uh,

325
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,130
the,

326
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,780
the her part little part of France and
the Italian border from being exploited

327
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:03,614
by tourism.

328
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,120
More about that at the end.

329
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,620
And with her tractor,

330
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:07,970
she led this demonstration.

331
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:09,140
It was a phenomenal thing.

332
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,760
And she ended up on this very famous
French television show called [inaudible].

333
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,490
Uh,

334
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,760
we've been not people who said that she
was one of the most interesting people

335
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:17,960
that he'd ever had on the show.

336
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:20,630
And she died in 1977 so,

337
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,650
and she published her,

338
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,670
her memoirs.

339
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:24,590
It was called a soup made of,

340
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:26,030
of wild herbs.

341
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:30,380
And of course it was translated in English
with that title and then they changed

342
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:31,214
it to a,

343
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:31,520
uh,

344
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,271
what did they change it to?

345
00:08:32,271 --> 00:08:32,751
An English,

346
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:33,830
a life of her own.

347
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,740
And it's about being a
young girl and a woman.

348
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,730
Uh,

349
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,720
but it's an extraordinary thing.

350
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:40,100
I became so obsessed with it that,

351
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:40,391
that,

352
00:08:40,391 --> 00:08:40,790
uh,

353
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,031
uh,

354
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:45,380
we drove up there so I could visit every
school that what she had taught and we

355
00:08:45,381 --> 00:08:48,320
actually found somebody that
we knew he wouldn't like her,

356
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:49,610
cause he was sweeping up the church.

357
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,070
He worked for one of the churches
and she was very anti clerical.

358
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,940
So we actually met somebody who knew
her and the school is now named after,

359
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,940
but it's a wonderful,

360
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,140
wonderful read.

361
00:08:58,141 --> 00:08:59,640
It's just a great,

362
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:01,680
my family got a little
tired of this and say,

363
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:02,071
do we have to,

364
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:04,950
how many more of these places do we
have to see in which this woman taught?

365
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:05,641
But,

366
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:05,890
uh,

367
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:06,220
uh,

368
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:06,631
anyway,

369
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:07,800
so we saw most of them.

370
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,690
And then I'll read about Moose,

371
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,290
uh,

372
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,850
who was a communist,

373
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,060
uh,

374
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:17,060
became a communist who was a writer in
a World War One and who served in World

375
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:17,760
War One.

376
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,900
And he wrote a great book,

377
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:22,500
which is called under fire that my
dear friend and colleague Jay Winter,

378
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:25,650
it's just written a new introduction for,

379
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,010
and that's about the,

380
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,400
the horrors of the trenches.

381
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:29,890
It's just,

382
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:30,270
you know,

383
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:30,951
it's just the,

384
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:31,784
the sheer,

385
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:32,701
it's just,

386
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:33,360
it's amazing.

387
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,380
It's amazing read too.

388
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,270
And then Mark Block.

389
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,990
And once I had the pleasure when I was
giving a talk at the University of Straws

390
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,820
Book and sitting in Mark Blocks office,

391
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,030
Mark Block,

392
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,530
uh,

393
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,180
taught people like me and,

394
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:45,900
uh,

395
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,970
the way to do history.

396
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:48,451
I mean,

397
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:51,990
there were people like me grew up on
reading mark block though I sure he was

398
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:52,950
much older than me.

399
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:53,491
Uh,

400
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:57,870
and he created a way of doing
history called the announced school.

401
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,430
And He,

402
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:00,180
um,

403
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,800
his first book actually was called,

404
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,270
uh,

405
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:02,530
uh,

406
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:07,410
the healing kings because in medieval
French times and medieval English times

407
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:08,710
when a king was crown,

408
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:13,560
there was this sense that if the
king could cure you by touching,

409
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:13,981
excuse me,

410
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:14,790
for touching you.

411
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,930
If you had [inaudible],

412
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,600
which is one which was sort
of a degenerative disease,

413
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:20,490
it's hard to find people that
have scratch feel anymore,

414
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,550
that king could touch
the person in and curate.

415
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,860
And it became part of sort of the,

416
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,030
of the popular culture of royalty.

417
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:27,211
And they,

418
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,290
and they try this in 18,

419
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,420
25 with disastrous results.

420
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,170
Uh,

421
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:31,650
but,

422
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,570
but this was his first great book.

423
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,580
And at the age of about 55,

424
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:39,690
the war came along and he wrote a book
called strange to feed explaining why in

425
00:10:39,691 --> 00:10:40,590
1940,

426
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,230
France fell so rapidly.

427
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,431
And then he'd been,

428
00:10:44,431 --> 00:10:49,200
he was Jewish and he was fired from
his post and straws Zboo under Vishi.

429
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:51,480
That is the collaboration
government and World War Two,

430
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:52,314
because he was Jewish.

431
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,720
And then he caught out
at University of mobile.

432
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:55,554
Yay.

433
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,450
And then they realized that he was a Jew,

434
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,100
so he was gone.

435
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,180
Then he went back to a
farm that he owned in the,

436
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:05,730
the Muzak in the codes up
here in near a boring place.

437
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,050
I used to work called gay,

438
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,500
and he sat around and thought,

439
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:10,621
well,

440
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:11,454
I'm gonna,

441
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,570
I'm gonna do something.

442
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,300
So not at a horribly advanced age,

443
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:16,620
I would like to think he,

444
00:11:16,621 --> 00:11:17,100
uh,

445
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,020
went to [inaudible],

446
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,060
which was a capital of the resistance
because they have all these things called

447
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:25,710
taboo in Leon was one reason they're
passageways where you'd keep the silk raw

448
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:26,790
silk dry.

449
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:27,930
And so he,

450
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,150
but he got set up by
somebody by French person,

451
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:31,140
more about this in a minute.

452
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,590
And he was supposed to meet somebody on
a bridge over looking at the Sun River.

453
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,290
The [inaudible] Leon was
at the confluence of the,

454
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,820
of the home and the song,

455
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,140
you'll learn a lot about France in here,

456
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:41,400
but we don't ask you questions like that.

457
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,520
What two rivers meet in Lille.

458
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:44,370
Uh,

459
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:49,320
but he was set up and he was
hitting Easley tortured here.

460
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,563
It was killed.

461
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,230
So Mark Bloch taught us in
a way how to do history,

462
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,680
but he also writing this book taught
us how to think about the past and more

463
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:02,740
about that in a minute.

464
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:08,250
And how to think about what happened
in France between 1940 in 1945.

465
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,030
I do a seminar on that,

466
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,650
uh,

467
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:10,780
uh,

468
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,120
next semester and then,

469
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,320
and then what?

470
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,250
And then I forgot one.

471
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,300
I forgot to put one in.

472
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:16,481
No,

473
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:16,631
no,

474
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:17,230
here it is.

475
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,800
Sarah Farmer who sat in the same class
room literally went before it was

476
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:21,634
remodeled.

477
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,350
I had wrote,

478
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,380
written a wonderful book called martyred
village was first appeared shade

479
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,253
Garima,

480
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,500
uh,

481
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,281
in France.

482
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:29,990
And it's about a village they know
very well because they used to live in,

483
00:12:29,991 --> 00:12:32,770
in Lemoshe I that in which,

484
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,580
uh,

485
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,540
on the 10th of June,

486
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,770
1944,

487
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,430
uh,

488
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,570
the SS German troops came and
simply slaughtered everybody.

489
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,900
They shot the man and they put the women
and the children in the church and they

490
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:46,804
killed them.

491
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:51,730
But what's interesting about that is
why this particular village became the

492
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:55,990
symbol for martyrdom in France.

493
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:56,891
Why?

494
00:12:56,891 --> 00:12:58,240
Because it was thought to be virgin.

495
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,400
There weren't resistors,

496
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,620
there weren't collaborators.

497
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,850
It was there,

498
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,683
it was martyred.

499
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,480
And,

500
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:06,620
uh,

501
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,630
so she wrote this book,

502
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:12,631
but with more interesting than that is
that the people who did the massacre in

503
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,210
the SS,

504
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,810
and many of them were l station.

505
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,510
Now stations were French,

506
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,760
even though many of them
spoke German dialect.

507
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,050
And so after war,

508
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,501
the war,

509
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:23,861
they said,

510
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:24,581
we are the medical,

511
00:13:24,581 --> 00:13:27,520
they knew we were put on trial because,

512
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:27,791
I mean,

513
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:31,090
we were in the army cause we were
forced to be because Alsace was a next

514
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:33,370
directly into Hitler's Reich.

515
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,720
And,

516
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,170
um,

517
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,430
when they were acquitted,

518
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:40,000
only two people who were
condemned from those forces,

519
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,200
uh,

520
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,970
they had joined voluntarily.

521
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:43,981
And the other,

522
00:13:43,981 --> 00:13:45,550
the amount of Gary knew where the,

523
00:13:45,551 --> 00:13:46,840
in spite of ourselves,

524
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,471
we're,

525
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:47,950
um,

526
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,700
we're,

527
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,180
uh,

528
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,631
pardon.

529
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:51,670
There were riots in the most
that they were pardoned.

530
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,700
There were riots in
Chordoma and in straws,

531
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:58,300
book in El Sauce that
they had been condemned,

532
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:58,811
uh,

533
00:13:58,811 --> 00:13:59,644
at all.

534
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,300
So identity national identity is very
complex and we talk about the war.

535
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,111
Uh,

536
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:05,501
this is,

537
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:05,640
uh,

538
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:05,831
you know,

539
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:08,710
it's a sparkling sparkling account.

540
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,860
And what they did with this
village ghoulish you might
say is they left at just

541
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:15,190
the way it is.

542
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,490
It was on the 10th of June,

543
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:23,290
1944 they left all the buildings blown
up or caught on fire and have crosses

544
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,340
where people were shot.

545
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,320
And there was a,

546
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,960
used to be a ghoulish museum with a
knife opened up that indicated that they

547
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:32,460
tried to defend themselves and then
now they put in assaulted demand.

548
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:32,880
Wow.

549
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,900
Cause her memory site there,

550
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:35,681
this kind of slick,

551
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:36,131
but it's fine.

552
00:14:36,131 --> 00:14:38,950
A friend of mine who was a senator
as the president of it there,

553
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,660
but they kept that village just the way
it was and they'd built one next to it

554
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,600
and about 1950 to some
people about your age.

555
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,290
I started to party and somebody
came up with a gun and said,

556
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,010
we don't party in order,

557
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:52,250
sir.

558
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,083
Gone.

559
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:58,150
So imagine growing up in a place like
that where the past was so was written not

560
00:14:58,491 --> 00:15:00,170
only in the death of people that you knew,

561
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:01,580
because everybody you knew who died,

562
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:03,680
basically one woman got out,

563
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:04,331
she went through the,

564
00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:04,610
the,

565
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,180
the,

566
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:05,361
uh,

567
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:05,561
the,

568
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:05,811
the,

569
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:06,800
there was a veto,

570
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:09,530
a window behind the altar
and she was able to get out.

571
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:09,981
Anyway.

572
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:10,640
So those are the,

573
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,600
the reading is great.

574
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,081
So what,

575
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:12,591
what can I say?

576
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:13,341
I'm slightly biased,

577
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:15,980
but the reading is great.

578
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,990
The reading rocks.

579
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,820
Now what about the films as movies?

580
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,253
Um,

581
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,420
inevitably there's paths of glory.

582
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,700
They associate a lot.

583
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:29,534
Grier,

584
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,730
if you've never seen it
as a Kirk Douglas movie,

585
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:32,660
that's a good movie.

586
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,680
Uh,

587
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,860
and it's about the mutinies
on the western front,

588
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,031
and it's very,

589
00:15:38,031 --> 00:15:38,720
very good.

590
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,291
We used to say,

591
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:39,591
well,

592
00:15:39,591 --> 00:15:43,060
come to one on one and it
will be filmed that at a,

593
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,080
we've shown it at 8:00 PM or something,

594
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:45,920
but nobody ever does that.

595
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:47,720
They all watch it in the
privacy of their rooms.

596
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,410
Uh,

597
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,490
or you can go watch it.

598
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:50,330
We'll figure it out.

599
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:50,730
But the,

600
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,820
it's a really a wonderful movie.

601
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,421
Uh,

602
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:54,254
and then,

603
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,130
uh,

604
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,360
you'll see a film called Oh,

605
00:15:56,361 --> 00:15:56,810
Voila.

606
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:57,643
Lays on phone,

607
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,320
sort of Sia children,

608
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:01,610
you by children.

609
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,460
How many have seen Louie
miles of Wiley's on farm?

610
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,690
Wow.

611
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,010
Many of you seen it's a great film.

612
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,121
It's a true story.

613
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:09,090
It's about Fontainebleau,

614
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:09,901
which is south of,

615
00:16:09,901 --> 00:16:10,430
uh,

616
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:10,641
uh,

617
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:11,750
southeast of Paris.

618
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:12,980
Sort of a fancy place.

619
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,920
And it's about his childhood
when he was in collage.

620
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,330
Collage is middle school.

621
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,620
You learn about French schools.

622
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,180
My kids have been friends
schools for many years.

623
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:20,710
So there,

624
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,160
so I know about these places.

625
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:22,970
Um,

626
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:23,691
and he,

627
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,690
there was a Sunday one day this
boy showed up in the class.

628
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:27,730
This is during Vishi.

629
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,360
It's about 1943.

630
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,500
Maybe it's 44.

631
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,150
And he's new and he's,

632
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,141
he's not different.

633
00:16:33,141 --> 00:16:35,120
He's just not from there.

634
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,613
He's obviously from,

635
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,060
from Paris.

636
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,583
And he was Jewish.

637
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,660
And it's about the attempt to,

638
00:16:41,661 --> 00:16:42,200
I mean,

639
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,710
the role of the Catholic
Church and in Vichy is not a,

640
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,420
a very savory one.

641
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,680
The French hierarchy,

642
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,331
uh,

643
00:16:49,331 --> 00:16:50,061
in many priests,

644
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:51,530
but many priests were very heroic.

645
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:55,430
And when this particular priest who was
a real live guy called a [inaudible]

646
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:55,791
father,

647
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:56,580
John,

648
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,050
uh,

649
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,130
tried to hide this boy in,

650
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:03,110
in the school so he wouldn't be
arrested and set off to the camps,

651
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,930
but he was denounced by
somebody who was in the militia,

652
00:17:05,931 --> 00:17:07,040
the released what's called,

653
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,340
which is sort of a of military
thugs that worked for Vishi.

654
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,440
And of course it does not have a happy,

655
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,423
happy ending.

656
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,750
And then the last film,

657
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,320
uh,

658
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,071
most of you won't,

659
00:17:16,071 --> 00:17:16,821
won't have seen it,

660
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:20,540
a call a lot in hate.

661
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,830
I guess you translate that as
hate or hatred and it's up.

662
00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:27,530
I'm very interested in what happened
in the fringe suburbs two years ago.

663
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:27,780
In fact,

664
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,560
I wrote a instant article on
it for an encyclopedia because,

665
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:31,190
uh,

666
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,550
uh,

667
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,600
some of the work I had earlier done,

668
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:37,370
it was about the y fringe suburbs in
a European suburbs are different than

669
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:38,600
American suburbs,

670
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,830
American suburban.

671
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:41,690
Many of you come from Hillsborough,

672
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:42,650
California,

673
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,521
uh,

674
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:44,061
Darien,

675
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:44,894
Connecticut,

676
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:45,741
Gross Pointe,

677
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:46,574
Michigan,

678
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,780
places like that.

679
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,580
That's not what the are in Europe.

680
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:54,030
Suburbs where people
unwanted by the center go.

681
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,860
And the fear of the suburbs has been
something that by the price per center has

682
00:17:58,861 --> 00:17:59,940
been a very long,

683
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:01,500
important theme in French history,

684
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,090
particularly written in Paris.

685
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:04,590
And I'll talk more about that.

686
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,240
And La in,

687
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:07,800
which was a small budget movie,

688
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:09,300
became this great success.

689
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:10,590
And it's a tough movie to watch.

690
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,933
It's tough.

691
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,470
It's verbally tough to watch
and it'll have subtitles,

692
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:20,160
but as it was done in 1996 or 97,

693
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,120
but it's,

694
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,953
uh,

695
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,150
uh,

696
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,760
it's really superb.

697
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,780
So what kind of,

698
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,890
don't want to give everything away,

699
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:27,950
but what kind of themes
do we have in [inaudible]?

700
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,681
And of course,

701
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:29,310
uh,

702
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:29,880
uh,

703
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,330
Eh,

704
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,890
in a course like this,

705
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:33,300
what have I forgotten about?

706
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:33,960
Oh,

707
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,390
me,

708
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:34,980
uh,

709
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,490
um,

710
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,220
I'm married and I said
that I still am actually.

711
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:38,540
Uh,

712
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:38,880
and,

713
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,271
and at some,

714
00:18:39,271 --> 00:18:41,540
sometimes I feel today
like yesterday that I,

715
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:41,751
I've,

716
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:42,490
I'm sort of,

717
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,201
I'm not,

718
00:18:43,201 --> 00:18:43,920
but anyway,

719
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,440
uh,

720
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:44,720
I have,

721
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,900
my office hours are,

722
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:46,734
um,

723
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,693
one of my officers,

724
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,150
uh,

725
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:53,150
Monday one to three in Branford
college where it was master long ago,

726
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,920
k 13 Branford College.

727
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,840
And I'm also like everybody else on
emails and I'll get your emails panicked

728
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:05,010
emails at three 10 in the morning
and I'll reply at four 45.

729
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,220
So it goes like,

730
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,110
it goes like that.

731
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,850
What kind of seems,

732
00:19:08,851 --> 00:19:09,091
I mean,

733
00:19:09,091 --> 00:19:10,980
talk a little bit about some of them.

734
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,180
Let me just talk about,

735
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:13,681
oh,

736
00:19:13,681 --> 00:19:15,270
about three or four of them,

737
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:18,060
just so you can see what hopefully
you were getting yourself into.

738
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,111
And you'll have fun.

739
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:21,360
You'll learn a lot about
France and tell you that.

740
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:21,931
Okay.

741
00:19:21,931 --> 00:19:24,240
One theme I'm interested in is,

742
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,870
uh,

743
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,920
well let me tell you about lectures.

744
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:26,580
First of all,

745
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,950
I do not do chronological lectures.

746
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:29,521
Well,

747
00:19:29,521 --> 00:19:33,870
an eight in 1882 and then
it was followed by 1883.

748
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:34,861
I don't do that.

749
00:19:34,861 --> 00:19:35,850
I lecture about what I'm,

750
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,140
what I like to talk about.

751
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:41,130
What's interesting that will hopefully
make you understand what the big issues

752
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,203
are,

753
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:42,841
uh,

754
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:43,920
in all of this.

755
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:45,270
So that's why it's a good thing to,

756
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:45,841
uh,

757
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:48,150
to come to lecture and
also to read the books.

758
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,760
But one of the things I'm
interested in is national identity.

759
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,630
And in fact,

760
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:53,880
because we kind of have complex,

761
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:54,540
uh,

762
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,140
uh,

763
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:55,321
you know,

764
00:19:55,321 --> 00:19:56,700
attitudes toward our own identity,

765
00:19:56,701 --> 00:19:57,390
I suppose.

766
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,410
I mean in my family,

767
00:19:58,770 --> 00:19:59,041
but,

768
00:19:59,041 --> 00:19:59,700
um,

769
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,660
if you took an,

770
00:20:00,661 --> 00:20:01,950
a few of you have heard
me say this before,

771
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:02,784
so forgive me.

772
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,091
Uh,

773
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:04,740
in 1789,

774
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:07,560
if you tried to guess
how many people spoke,

775
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:08,021
uh,

776
00:20:08,021 --> 00:20:10,380
French in France,

777
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,070
you might come up with
80% as a guests are 90 or,

778
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,241
or whatever it was,

779
00:20:15,241 --> 00:20:16,440
about 50%.

780
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,180
Some people were bilingual.

781
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:19,140
So what did they speak?

782
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:19,890
Uh,

783
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:20,340
uh,

784
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:20,610
well,

785
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:20,791
I mean,

786
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:21,450
if you want to remit,

787
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,160
we'll start anywhere you want it.

788
00:20:23,161 --> 00:20:23,611
Breton,

789
00:20:23,611 --> 00:20:26,640
which is a language has nothing to do
with French at all here or I've got a

790
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:27,331
really funny story about,

791
00:20:27,331 --> 00:20:27,841
it was hard to tell you,

792
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:29,860
but tell me about Breton priest in,

793
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,260
in a French speaking Breton priests,

794
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,940
but that's another for another day anyway.

795
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,953
Uh,

796
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,460
they spoke Breton here.

797
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:37,830
Now not isn't considered
technically part of Britain,

798
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,191
Brittany,

799
00:20:38,191 --> 00:20:39,510
but they spoke Raton there,

800
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:39,961
uh,

801
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:42,270
which is basically a Gaelic language.

802
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,130
And then if you go up,

803
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:44,461
you think,

804
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:44,611
well,

805
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:45,900
they spoke French there,

806
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,200
uh,

807
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,220
certainly in Normandy,

808
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,580
but they spoke in many parts of it,

809
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,660
parts of a Patois.

810
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,400
And about 1844,

811
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:55,780
this kind of crazy guy took a big knife
and he slit the throat of his mother and

812
00:20:55,781 --> 00:21:00,010
his two sisters and they were
the police looking for him.

813
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,480
And he was from Normandy.

814
00:21:01,481 --> 00:21:03,220
He lived near call in,

815
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:03,530
uh,

816
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:03,761
you know,

817
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:04,594
in Normandy.

818
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,920
And they found him eating clams and
things for survival on the beach.

819
00:21:08,921 --> 00:21:10,600
And they had to bring in a translator,

820
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,110
somebody to translate it
before he was getting,

821
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:14,440
uh,

822
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:14,890
he,

823
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,270
he dictated his life.

824
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,060
The book,

825
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,540
uh,

826
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,190
uh,

827
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,240
Michelle from coal,

828
00:21:19,241 --> 00:21:23,650
a famous philosopher got ahold of I
and wrote a preface for it in French.

829
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,150
It was [inaudible] the Ai,

830
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:25,401
you know,

831
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:26,290
I call shame.

832
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:26,621
I May,

833
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:30,730
I may do a cer media PR riviere
having slit the throat of my,

834
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,470
my mother and my two sisters,

835
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,030
I'm going to tell it like it was,

836
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,013
and he did.

837
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,470
Uh,

838
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,061
but they had them.

839
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:38,290
The important thing is that they
had to have a translated for him.

840
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,430
And the 1840s,

841
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,060
uh,

842
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,030
when Bernadette [inaudible] in 1856,

843
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,860
I believe that she saw the Virgin Mary,

844
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:45,341
of course,

845
00:21:45,341 --> 00:21:47,590
they had to have somebody
come and translate their,

846
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,041
uh,

847
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:51,730
what was a mountain patois influenced by,

848
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,160
uh,

849
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,290
by,

850
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,260
by Spanish.

851
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:53,591
Uh,

852
00:21:53,591 --> 00:21:55,240
but if we'll move north here,

853
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:55,931
up here,

854
00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:58,300
and there were a lot of
the people I spoke Flemish,

855
00:21:58,301 --> 00:21:59,134
very few.

856
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,790
Now you don't have said no,

857
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:01,960
this is just kind of fun.

858
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:02,501
Uh,

859
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:02,831
I mean,

860
00:22:02,831 --> 00:22:03,251
I love it.

861
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:03,850
But anyway,

862
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,210
uh,

863
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:07,720
and then in parts of the van they spoke
a German dialect is very much like

864
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:10,300
what's spoken in Fribourg in Alsace.

865
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,350
Almost everybody,

866
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,820
as you will see later,

867
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,920
US spoke German dialect.

868
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,510
But it didn't mean if you ask somebody,

869
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,441
are you French?

870
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:18,910
And they were the reply in German.

871
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:19,151
Yes,

872
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:19,950
I'm French.

873
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:20,350
You know,

874
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:20,861
that doesn't,

875
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:25,000
language isn't necessarily tell you
how people feel about their identity.

876
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,220
Some sage once said,

877
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,031
I don't know who it was,

878
00:22:28,031 --> 00:22:29,470
but I love this expression,

879
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,640
um,

880
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,560
that a language is a dialect
with a powerful army.

881
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,450
Look at Spain.

882
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:43,260
Why was cut to not illegal to publish
until Frankel Croaked in 1975 clutching

883
00:22:44,171 --> 00:22:49,171
the left elbow Santra as of something
rather because custie Spanish speaking

884
00:22:51,191 --> 00:22:56,191
custody with his command economy had
conquered the bosques and conquered a

885
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,430
conquered the catalog.

886
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,530
And so,

887
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,790
um,

888
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,193
uh,

889
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,071
all of this,

890
00:23:03,071 --> 00:23:04,680
what will change and you know,

891
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,550
during this period or if
you move further down,

892
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,680
you get into [inaudible] which
was a US voice of what's,

893
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:11,381
of why he said,

894
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:11,650
well,

895
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:12,760
which were were a,

896
00:23:12,761 --> 00:23:14,590
a next in 1860.

897
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,540
And they spoke in essentially Piedmontese,

898
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:17,590
they spoken Italian,

899
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:18,051
uh,

900
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:18,884
a language.

901
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,980
If you go to provost,

902
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,620
then provost sal is a written language.

903
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,430
Uh,

904
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:24,641
you know,

905
00:23:24,641 --> 00:23:25,361
you get a sense of that.

906
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:26,350
If you see a really great movie,

907
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:27,310
like you want to flow hat,

908
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:27,491
you know,

909
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:28,870
with the inevitable as you are,

910
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:31,600
they probably do is in every
single film made this side,

911
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,400
this side of Disneyland.

912
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,263
He Disney,

913
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,560
he is there.

914
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,160
Uh,

915
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,911
but with Danielle,

916
00:23:36,911 --> 00:23:37,331
oh toy,

917
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:38,260
who was fantastic,

918
00:23:38,261 --> 00:23:40,840
he had to put one of those things that
Dennis put in your mouth when they're

919
00:23:40,841 --> 00:23:41,760
going to give you a,

920
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:42,280
uh,

921
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,250
an x ray to make you feel uncomfortable
in order to pronounce perfectly.

922
00:23:46,251 --> 00:23:46,491
This,

923
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:46,761
this,

924
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:47,571
this Provence,

925
00:23:47,571 --> 00:23:48,810
sal language it,

926
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,710
and it's not just the accident of anger,

927
00:23:50,711 --> 00:23:50,841
you know,

928
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:51,260
you know,

929
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,920
cuts Vanga or all Fang instead of on five.

930
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,610
Uh,

931
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:55,931
it's,

932
00:23:55,931 --> 00:23:56,480
it was,

933
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,770
it's a whole language.

934
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,030
And moving along here,

935
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:00,200
you get down to Catalonia.

936
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:02,210
This French Catalonia speaks the same.

937
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,810
We still own old ladies down there
who speaks that same language,

938
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,340
spoke down all the way to Valencia,

939
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,690
at least along the coast.

940
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,711
You move in here,

941
00:24:09,711 --> 00:24:11,120
you go to Bosc country.

942
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,590
Besides all the Patois,

943
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:13,221
you go to the boss.

944
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:15,410
Country Bosc is only remotely related,

945
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:17,960
the finish and the Magyar Hungarian.

946
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:18,920
Uh,

947
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,661
and then you,

948
00:24:19,661 --> 00:24:19,840
uh,

949
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,031
you know,

950
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:20,450
we've got to,

951
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,240
you got over in the Patois here
you've got Leemoo is an plot.

952
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,080
Patois.

953
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,220
You've got all these languages.

954
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:30,430
So the only point of interest about this
is that when new people start thinking

955
00:24:31,131 --> 00:24:34,070
that they're French as opposed
to from a certain family,

956
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,080
from a certain village,

957
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,060
from a certain region,

958
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:38,990
uh,

959
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,670
when did they start seeing
themselves as French?

960
00:24:40,671 --> 00:24:44,750
And this is being hotly debated in
the literature for a very long time.

961
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,020
There are still people
now that live there.

962
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,870
There's a woman who lives near our
village and she's lived in our village.

963
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:51,141
I mean,

964
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:55,430
she was born in the next village and
she's lived in our village for 40 years

965
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,640
because she married a guy from the
village and she's from the next village,

966
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,430
about 20 foot ball throws away or more,

967
00:25:01,431 --> 00:25:02,264
a little more than that.

968
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,231
And uh,

969
00:25:03,231 --> 00:25:04,700
somebody as a joke once asked her,

970
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:04,971
how to,

971
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:07,850
how do you feel living in this
village after all these years?

972
00:25:07,851 --> 00:25:08,684
And she said,

973
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,021
oh,

974
00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:10,400
sometimes I get homesick.

975
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,120
Uh,

976
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,160
there was a sense that she's,

977
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,490
she'll never be from the village.

978
00:25:13,491 --> 00:25:14,480
He's from somewhere else.

979
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:19,570
But sometime between 1750 and maybe 1990,

980
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:27,020
most almost everybody in France
began seeing themselves as French.

981
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,530
And the schools play a major role in this.

982
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:35,960
And thus all these kids who
grew up speaking Patois or
Provence sal or Gaskell,

983
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,580
I'm forgotten.

984
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,710
Gaskell uh,

985
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,780
around Boldo,

986
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:39,680
uh,

987
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,300
they,

988
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:40,670
uh,

989
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,280
can sing the mousy as
an acceptable franchise.

990
00:25:43,281 --> 00:25:46,610
They marked you off to be
slaughtered a when do people,

991
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:47,300
and it's,

992
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,630
when do parents become
freshmen as someone posed?

993
00:25:50,631 --> 00:25:53,030
And it's interesting question
because it tells you a lot about,

994
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:53,570
you know,

995
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:53,711
uh,

996
00:25:53,711 --> 00:25:54,290
about,

997
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:54,920
uh,

998
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,221
uh,

999
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:59,010
regional identity and about national
identity and the role they were,

1000
00:25:59,011 --> 00:26:03,740
all the schools is important in that
because what happens is that the Virgin

1001
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,800
Mary gets elbowed off
the walls by Marianne,

1002
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,440
the female image of the republic.

1003
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,680
And that's that it starts
with the French revolution,

1004
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,010
but it's a very long process
and we'll talk some about that,

1005
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,990
but not that much.

1006
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:19,520
Um,

1007
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,261
I guess the,

1008
00:26:20,261 --> 00:26:20,371
the,

1009
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:24,650
the other two themes I want to
discuss a and not in great detail,

1010
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,460
uh,

1011
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:25,970
but,

1012
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:26,300
uh,

1013
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:26,451
you know,

1014
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:27,284
are the wars.

1015
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:28,341
I mean,

1016
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:33,341
obviously world war one is unleashes
the demons of the 20th century.

1017
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:38,090
Nobody could have anticipated that
all these empires would collapse.

1018
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:42,300
Antisemitism was out there before
that in Germany and France,

1019
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:43,830
as you'll see with the Dreyfus affair,

1020
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,120
all sorts of places.

1021
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:45,960
But,

1022
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,410
uh,

1023
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,630
we're all one transformed Hitler,

1024
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:49,740
uh,

1025
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,740
from a man who hated Social Democrats
who hated socialists into a man,

1026
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,380
obsessed with killing Jews were a,

1027
00:26:58,381 --> 00:27:00,900
one has an enormous impact on,

1028
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:04,260
on the way people viewed themselves in,

1029
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:04,680
uh,

1030
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,510
France and in everywhere.

1031
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,200
Everybody knew people who died in the war.

1032
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,900
It was the defining experience
for the 20th century.

1033
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,730
And the violence of the war continues
into the 1920s and thirties.

1034
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,180
So you can see the whole period
until 1945 is it even more horrible,

1035
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:25,080
30 years' war than that
of the 17th century.

1036
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,730
There are 35,000,

1037
00:27:26,731 --> 00:27:31,731
36,000 communes in France
that is administrative units.

1038
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,090
Paris is a commune,

1039
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,240
but so as a village of 12 people is
a commun 36,000 in World War One.

1040
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,690
Only 12 didn't have somebody killed.

1041
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:48,270
France in the 1920s was a
country of widows dressed in,

1042
00:27:48,271 --> 00:27:48,810
in,

1043
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:53,810
in black of people missing
limbs or coughing their
lungs out from the poison gas

1044
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:55,770
if they were lucky enough to survive.

1045
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,480
Putting huge strains,

1046
00:27:57,481 --> 00:27:57,710
which,

1047
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,140
uh,

1048
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:58,321
you know,

1049
00:27:58,321 --> 00:27:58,690
I'm,

1050
00:27:58,690 --> 00:27:59,970
I'm welfare systems.

1051
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:03,360
Obviously it was very important that they
be taken care of in a country in which

1052
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:07,840
the birth rate had stopped in most of
the country in the mid 19th century,

1053
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,630
unique in the world.

1054
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:10,590
Uh,

1055
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,740
there weren't enough men to go round.

1056
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,510
They were dead.

1057
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,260
You can go into villages
and towns almost anywhere,

1058
00:28:19,261 --> 00:28:23,040
particularly in the lower
must've song trial down here.

1059
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,190
And you can find a in towns of,

1060
00:28:26,191 --> 00:28:27,300
of just tiny,

1061
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,230
tiny towns,

1062
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,280
74.

1063
00:28:29,281 --> 00:28:30,300
I am a counter.

1064
00:28:30,301 --> 00:28:31,560
I count things all the time,

1065
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:32,400
drives me crazy.

1066
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,360
Uh,

1067
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:33,720
uh,

1068
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:33,901
you know,

1069
00:28:33,901 --> 00:28:38,370
I'll count up the number of people killed
and every church that I go to visit to

1070
00:28:38,371 --> 00:28:40,030
look at it,

1071
00:28:40,031 --> 00:28:41,340
it's simply extraordinary.

1072
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,160
We can't even imagine what that's like.

1073
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:46,710
There are only three people left in
Britain who fought in world war one,

1074
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:47,281
only three.

1075
00:28:47,281 --> 00:28:50,100
And there are about 110 years
old or something like that.

1076
00:28:50,101 --> 00:28:51,450
But it's difficult to,

1077
00:28:51,451 --> 00:28:52,030
to,

1078
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,010
to understand,

1079
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:53,520
uh,

1080
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,480
what the impact was and the poisoning
of the political atmosphere.

1081
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,090
Uh,

1082
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:58,240
the,

1083
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,560
uh,

1084
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,270
we'll talk about the battle of the Somme.

1085
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:03,660
S O m m e in the battle of the Somme.

1086
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:04,501
Uh,

1087
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:07,560
in the first day of the
battle of the Somme,

1088
00:29:07,561 --> 00:29:11,640
the 1st of July,

1089
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:11,910
1916,

1090
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:16,910
there were 20,000 British soldiers
killed in the first three days,

1091
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,020
just counting the British.

1092
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,980
There were more British soldiers
killed and seriously wounded.

1093
00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:25,140
And there were Americans
killed in world war one,

1094
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:30,830
Korea and Vietnam combined in three days,

1095
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,760
comparable chilling effects in Russia,

1096
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:36,601
uh,

1097
00:29:36,601 --> 00:29:38,460
and in Britain and in Austria,

1098
00:29:38,461 --> 00:29:40,230
Hungary as well,

1099
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:45,470
where with the flower of English youth
is used to say whether were hung up on

1100
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,050
that old barbed wire,

1101
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:47,980
they were dead.

1102
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,290
And your life expectancy wasn't very
good because the foolish military,

1103
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,010
uh,

1104
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:54,221
uh,

1105
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:58,360
decisions because of a war that ended
up being the war fought in which no one

1106
00:29:58,361 --> 00:30:01,600
outside of a few people who had seen the
Russell Japanese war around mucked and

1107
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,100
could have ever imagined.

1108
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,030
Uh,

1109
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:04,270
we,

1110
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:04,780
you know,

1111
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,710
the finest,

1112
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:09,160
some of the finest books
on any topic are those,

1113
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:09,410
uh,

1114
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,230
of history or those on world war one.

1115
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,270
The Great War and modern memory,

1116
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:13,921
uh,

1117
00:30:13,921 --> 00:30:18,340
of the British have Siegfried SAS
soon about Siegfried SAS SAS soon.

1118
00:30:18,341 --> 00:30:19,270
And Wilfred Owen,

1119
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:19,601
who's,

1120
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:20,050
uh,

1121
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:24,580
who's mother got the news that he'd
been killed on the day of the armistice.

1122
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:25,730
Uh,

1123
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:25,971
you know,

1124
00:30:25,971 --> 00:30:27,130
there's an extraordinary literature.

1125
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,760
The close come Kohona they're
close to a competition for that.

1126
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:31,570
Uh,

1127
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:34,880
richest literature would be the Spanish
civil war with Orwell and Bork and,

1128
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:35,540
and,

1129
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,373
and Brennan.

1130
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,080
But we'll talk a lot about world war one,

1131
00:30:38,081 --> 00:30:39,130
how it started,

1132
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:42,100
what it meant and what the impact was.

1133
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,640
And there's nowhere you can go in northern
France where you're not just a wash

1134
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:46,450
with,

1135
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:46,900
uh,

1136
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,380
with,

1137
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,213
uh,

1138
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,130
with military cemeteries around Ras.

1139
00:30:51,131 --> 00:30:51,781
There any,

1140
00:30:51,781 --> 00:30:54,310
we're up in the end near
the showman did dom,

1141
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,070
these are battlefields in which,

1142
00:30:56,071 --> 00:30:57,480
which every day in fact,

1143
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:57,590
the,

1144
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:57,881
the bottle,

1145
00:30:57,881 --> 00:30:58,571
the battle of Somme,

1146
00:30:58,571 --> 00:31:02,840
there's one casualty for every
meter of the entire front of,

1147
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,790
of the war.

1148
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:04,421
I mean,

1149
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:04,501
a,

1150
00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:05,440
of that particular battle.

1151
00:31:05,441 --> 00:31:05,591
I mean,

1152
00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:06,430
it's really extraordinary,

1153
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:06,910
man.

1154
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,710
It goes on and on and on and on.

1155
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,370
And we'll talk about the impact of what,

1156
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:10,521
what,

1157
00:31:10,521 --> 00:31:11,740
what this happened.

1158
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:12,940
I mean obviously impacts,

1159
00:31:12,941 --> 00:31:13,751
but what happened on,

1160
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:14,020
on,

1161
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,460
uh,

1162
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:19,330
an on civil society and on politics where
we're the leaders of the 20s and the

1163
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,163
30s,

1164
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,100
they were dead.

1165
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,210
They were dead healed at 18 killed at 19.

1166
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,560
I was in the British war museum,

1167
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,970
Imperial War Museum the other day,

1168
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,730
and I'd been there four or five times,

1169
00:31:29,731 --> 00:31:30,131
and I went,

1170
00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:30,911
and it's a hell of what they have,

1171
00:31:30,911 --> 00:31:32,440
a thing where you can look up dead people.

1172
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:33,520
Uh,

1173
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,091
and so I said,

1174
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:34,181
well,

1175
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:36,040
I wonder if there's somebody
with my name was killed.

1176
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:36,820
And there was,

1177
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,200
and my uncle had an extremely odd,

1178
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:41,710
my grandfather had extremely odd name
and there was somebody of his name too

1179
00:31:41,711 --> 00:31:42,544
that was killed.

1180
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:43,563
They all died.

1181
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,290
Uh,

1182
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,580
and it was not everybody,

1183
00:31:45,581 --> 00:31:45,850
but,

1184
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:46,200
uh,

1185
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,751
in France,

1186
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:48,640
1,000,500 thousand people died.

1187
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:50,530
And that's a huge demographic chunk.

1188
00:31:50,531 --> 00:31:51,550
It's like a big shark.

1189
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:55,690
Took a big bite out of your basic
pyramid or your demographic,

1190
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,580
a tree and someone like Hitler.

1191
00:31:57,581 --> 00:31:57,731
I mean,

1192
00:31:57,731 --> 00:31:58,870
this isn't a course on Hitler,

1193
00:31:58,871 --> 00:32:00,550
but it's from the other course.

1194
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:01,090
But,

1195
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:01,540
uh,

1196
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,630
you know why this guy who had
no friends who was just a pain,

1197
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,801
just a pain,

1198
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:06,531
he was so pain.

1199
00:32:06,531 --> 00:32:07,630
He believes such a pain.

1200
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,910
And he had the one guy
that he used to bore with,

1201
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:10,091
you know,

1202
00:32:10,091 --> 00:32:12,900
his stories about
architecture and painting and,

1203
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:17,240
and Wagner who we love dearly and in it,

1204
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,740
you could never imagine that he
would be somebody that people would,

1205
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:23,380
would listen to on the
radio of hour after hour.

1206
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,590
Cause that's how long he talked or that
when Stauffenberg tries to kill him in

1207
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:27,490
1944,

1208
00:32:27,491 --> 00:32:32,080
the Germans would pour out of the end of
the street to thank God for saving the

1209
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:32,321
fuel.

1210
00:32:32,321 --> 00:32:33,154
Her.

1211
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:36,040
Why did he become somebody Sieg Heil?

1212
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,450
He was one of the guys.

1213
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,973
He's one of the guy,

1214
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:43,340
he's one of the guys had been wounded
three times and he was a runner that he

1215
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:44,174
carried,

1216
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,340
carried messages.

1217
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,620
The trenches from the generals were all
drinking champagne and her ass to the

1218
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:49,430
front.

1219
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:49,641
I,

1220
00:32:49,641 --> 00:32:51,920
and he was wounded three
times and he was one of them.

1221
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,090
He had that,

1222
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:53,930
that,

1223
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,560
uh,

1224
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,400
that stamp of having been one of the
guys and the violence keeps going.

1225
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:02,420
You have to explain why all of this has
happened and you have to find people

1226
00:33:02,421 --> 00:33:03,380
that made it happen.

1227
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:06,890
And it was the Jews and it was a socialist
and it was the communist and it was a

1228
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,900
homosexuals and we'll kill them all.

1229
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:10,730
And that's what he did.

1230
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,740
And for the point of view of France,

1231
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:17,810
they emerged from the war with the
reality that they are in victory,

1232
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:20,090
a weaker nation than Germany is in defeat.

1233
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:24,440
And so it's a big shadow
over the whole damn thing.

1234
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,600
The incredible and Mark Block,

1235
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:28,010
when you read the collapse of France,

1236
00:33:28,011 --> 00:33:28,161
it's,

1237
00:33:28,161 --> 00:33:28,311
you know,

1238
00:33:28,311 --> 00:33:29,144
it's very interesting,

1239
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,253
interesting stuff.

1240
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,850
World work too.

1241
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,013
You know what I mean?

1242
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,810
I'll give you two stories.

1243
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:36,831
When I was in,

1244
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:37,664
um,

1245
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,290
working in a place called [inaudible],

1246
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:39,891
which is down here,

1247
00:33:39,891 --> 00:33:41,630
t u l l e not to have but to,

1248
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:42,770
um,

1249
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:46,640
I knew vaguely that there
had been a massacre there in,

1250
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,210
uh,

1251
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:47,870
uh,

1252
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:48,680
June six,

1253
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,760
1944.

1254
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:50,970
And then a lot of people had been hung.

1255
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,980
I didn't have any money,

1256
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:52,551
you know,

1257
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:53,390
my kids would say,

1258
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:53,960
Oh dad,

1259
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,730
not that I don't have
any money story again,

1260
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:56,870
but I didn't have any money.

1261
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:57,631
And so I would have,

1262
00:33:57,631 --> 00:33:57,980
uh,

1263
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,371
uh,

1264
00:33:58,371 --> 00:33:58,671
you know,

1265
00:33:58,671 --> 00:33:58,960
I,

1266
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,450
I would be eating ice cream and I got
to know this guy with my not very good

1267
00:34:02,451 --> 00:34:03,710
French then,

1268
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:04,370
uh,

1269
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,030
and uh,

1270
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,470
we talked and I said,

1271
00:34:06,471 --> 00:34:06,860
where are you?

1272
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:11,630
You remember the day the Germans
came back and hung all those people?

1273
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,111
And he said,

1274
00:34:12,111 --> 00:34:12,710
yeah.

1275
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:12,981
I said,

1276
00:34:12,981 --> 00:34:13,731
well how did you get away?

1277
00:34:13,731 --> 00:34:14,061
And he said,

1278
00:34:14,061 --> 00:34:14,241
well,

1279
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:15,074
it's a tool on,

1280
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,340
it was a big valleys,

1281
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:19,600
real long town and these
houses have balconies.

1282
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:20,091
So like this.

1283
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,140
So he went up and he hid.

1284
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:21,891
He was 12.

1285
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:24,110
He had been killed for Keenan didn't care,

1286
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,863
they didn't care.

1287
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:26,461
And,

1288
00:34:26,461 --> 00:34:26,720
um,

1289
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,141
one day,

1290
00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:29,650
so I was eating my ice cream cause
the archives were closed and this,

1291
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:33,290
this woman came up and she was probably
about 50 or something like that and she

1292
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:34,250
ordered an ice cream.

1293
00:34:34,251 --> 00:34:35,120
And so this guy says,

1294
00:34:35,121 --> 00:34:35,301
well,

1295
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:35,870
you know,

1296
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,470
uh,

1297
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:37,070
but on whatever,

1298
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:37,280
madame,

1299
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,820
if we a,

1300
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,110
you remember that day,

1301
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:39,860
don't you?

1302
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,450
When the Germans came back and she said,

1303
00:34:41,451 --> 00:34:41,571
oh,

1304
00:34:41,571 --> 00:34:41,991
I sure do.

1305
00:34:41,991 --> 00:34:44,000
They hung my husband from that poll.

1306
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,370
And that poll was right next to,

1307
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:47,060
uh,

1308
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,241
uh,

1309
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:50,510
next to this ice cream stand in
front of the theater in tune.

1310
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:51,591
And that,

1311
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:54,620
that was 1970 more about that in a second.

1312
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:58,070
And I have a friend is [inaudible] lawyer
who works in that worked in Africa a

1313
00:34:58,071 --> 00:34:58,850
lot.

1314
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,140
And when he was a little boy,

1315
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,040
um,

1316
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,510
the Germans came to get his father who
was a Greek Jew and he was taken away and

1317
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:06,344
kill the course.

1318
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,450
And one shouldn't forget
that the people who rent,

1319
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,680
who rounded up the Jewish
children and the Ma,

1320
00:35:12,681 --> 00:35:13,220
hey,

1321
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:13,551
we were,

1322
00:35:13,551 --> 00:35:14,241
lots of Jews,

1323
00:35:14,241 --> 00:35:15,074
lived,

1324
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:15,351
uh,

1325
00:35:15,351 --> 00:35:16,130
were French.

1326
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,120
The Germans wouldn't be happy to do it.

1327
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,200
We're French police,

1328
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,520
they're French police.

1329
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:23,720
And his father was
denounced by a policeman.

1330
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:25,243
Why policemen?

1331
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,750
And after the war that policemen directed
traffic at the market every Saturday,

1332
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:34,580
and the widow walked by and saw this
man knowing he had denounced her husband

1333
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:36,020
who had been taken away and killed.

1334
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,130
Now in 1970,

1335
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:41,820
there were still this
collective amnesia in France.

1336
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,550
The myth perpetuated by de Gaulle,

1337
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,930
the big guy,

1338
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:47,610
was it in France?

1339
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,190
Everybody had resisted
except for a few elites.

1340
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:55,650
And then France had risen up to follow
his great shadow and it's thrown off the

1341
00:35:55,651 --> 00:35:57,900
oppressor and found a republic.

1342
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:04,250
In 1953 there was a documentary made
about the deportation of Jews from Paris.

1343
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,800
And there was a film I made about this.

1344
00:36:07,801 --> 00:36:07,921
They,

1345
00:36:07,921 --> 00:36:08,220
this,

1346
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,930
they put together a documentary and the,

1347
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:11,000
in one of the f,

1348
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,260
the,

1349
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,290
the one of the scenes,

1350
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:14,820
it's a camp place called General C,

1351
00:36:14,821 --> 00:36:15,930
which is out near the airport,

1352
00:36:15,931 --> 00:36:18,120
halfway to the airport to Yc airport.

1353
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,560
And there was a German,

1354
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,610
I mean a French gendarme
who is guarding the German.

1355
00:36:23,611 --> 00:36:24,780
I mean the French Jews,

1356
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,850
French gendarme guarding the French Jews.

1357
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,440
And they lifted him out of the movie.

1358
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,840
They literally took him off the screen.

1359
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:33,510
So if you see it Iain there,

1360
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,261
why?

1361
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:35,860
Because the image was nobody collaborator,

1362
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,713
hardly anybody.

1363
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,160
And everybody resisted.

1364
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:39,930
Now that Amnesia,

1365
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,230
which had Pardot is the gold,

1366
00:36:41,231 --> 00:36:45,510
didn't want to give the communists credit
because they were the party of 75,000

1367
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:48,300
martyrs cause they were
organized and they resisted.

1368
00:36:48,301 --> 00:36:49,081
Other people did too.

1369
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,340
There was a Catholic resistance.

1370
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:50,700
Uh,

1371
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,890
there was your golf basic
gaullist resistance.

1372
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,360
I'm going to gall died.

1373
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:55,051
I was in Paris,

1374
00:36:55,051 --> 00:36:59,190
I was the only person frisk going into
notice ultra dom literally that I saw

1375
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,390
that threw me up against the wall.

1376
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:02,240
I'm checking me out
cause I was a kid and I,

1377
00:37:02,241 --> 00:37:02,670
and I,

1378
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,500
I wanted to go there and see this,

1379
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,041
you know,

1380
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:07,680
just for the purpose of
history of being there,

1381
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,890
but to go all perpetuated this
myth about the resistance.

1382
00:37:10,891 --> 00:37:13,320
And then there were cracks in the myth.

1383
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:17,860
And the first crack was a movie that is
so long that it used to be the janitors

1384
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:20,910
who people who clean these very
nice people who clean these rooms,

1385
00:37:20,911 --> 00:37:23,610
used to call it a two six pack
movie because it was so long.

1386
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,241
It was,

1387
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:24,510
uh,

1388
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,220
it was forced on us was
to say that we're filling,

1389
00:37:26,221 --> 00:37:26,371
but,

1390
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:26,710
but,

1391
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,020
uh,

1392
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,581
there was for you,

1393
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:28,830
you just cut that baby out of there.

1394
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:28,971
But,

1395
00:37:28,971 --> 00:37:29,190
but,

1396
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:29,640
uh,

1397
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,120
uh,

1398
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:34,020
that is about a for a film and it's
called the sorrow and the pity in,

1399
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:36,030
it's about a Claremont fit hall,

1400
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,250
which is in the Macias on trial here.

1401
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,510
And there's some amazing scenes in
it where they shaved their heads of,

1402
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:41,810
of,

1403
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,560
of horizontal collaborators,

1404
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,840
which is sort of a crude
way of talking about,

1405
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,111
you know,

1406
00:37:46,111 --> 00:37:48,000
French women who slept
with German officers,

1407
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,350
horizontal collaboration.

1408
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,160
Uh,

1409
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,410
and at the end of the movie there was a,

1410
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,190
there was a,

1411
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:52,440
uh,

1412
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,221
Maritia Chevelle,

1413
00:37:53,221 --> 00:37:53,760
Yay.

1414
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,230
Risha by Aa was a crooner.

1415
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,064
He was a singer.

1416
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:56,700
He was a,

1417
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,050
if your parents knew about France,

1418
00:37:58,051 --> 00:38:01,410
he was the person that your
grandparents even had heard about.

1419
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:04,350
And he was somebody from a poor
part of Paris and for many,

1420
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,193
multiple.

1421
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,900
And he had a straw hat and he sung tunes
and value good my boys and all of this

1422
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:10,500
stuff.

1423
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,360
And at the end of the movie he says,

1424
00:38:12,361 --> 00:38:12,721
you know,

1425
00:38:12,721 --> 00:38:17,280
there are these very bad rumors about
the me and a that I sang for the German

1426
00:38:17,281 --> 00:38:17,671
troops.

1427
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:18,630
And I want to tell you,

1428
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:20,400
I only sang for z boys.

1429
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,450
That is the French,

1430
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,320
uh,

1431
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,830
that has for the French
intern soldiers in,

1432
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,420
in,

1433
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:25,890
in,

1434
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:26,161
in,

1435
00:38:26,161 --> 00:38:26,520
in,

1436
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,540
in Germany.

1437
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:28,230
Then,

1438
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:28,471
you know,

1439
00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:29,610
it may have been true or May,

1440
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,241
maybe not,

1441
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,610
but it made people start
looking at the past.

1442
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:37,670
What really happened between
1940 and 1945 or 44 to 44.

1443
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:40,810
What really happened?

1444
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,550
There was a trial of a very old
man in 1998 about called Merissa.

1445
00:38:45,551 --> 00:38:50,200
Poppo tried in bold doll and
he did very well after the war.

1446
00:38:50,201 --> 00:38:51,430
He had signed during the war,

1447
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:55,720
all sorts of slips that sent Jews off
to the station and the gas national and

1448
00:38:55,721 --> 00:38:58,390
Boldo to the train station to
be shipped off to the east.

1449
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,470
But he did very well.

1450
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:03,820
He became a minor Gaullist official and
he did very well and they finally caught

1451
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:05,170
up with him and he said,

1452
00:39:05,171 --> 00:39:06,190
I'm a good bureaucrat.

1453
00:39:06,191 --> 00:39:06,790
I did.

1454
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,230
They were pleased with my work.

1455
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,640
I signed those fees,

1456
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:09,910
those,

1457
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,140
those formulas.

1458
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:15,700
And if I hadn't been there to save the
hundreds and they all would've died and

1459
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:16,240
he was converted,

1460
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,860
you can't put somebody 90 years old,

1461
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:18,221
uh,

1462
00:39:18,221 --> 00:39:18,630
in,

1463
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,770
in the slam air.

1464
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,970
And so he was in kind of this very,

1465
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,500
very minimum security.

1466
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,880
And he finally just croaked,

1467
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:25,400
uh,

1468
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:25,560
uh,

1469
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,180
a while ago,

1470
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,060
one point that he tried to,

1471
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,920
he escaped actually with help with some
friends and they found him dining and an

1472
00:39:29,921 --> 00:39:31,180
elegant Swiss restaurant.

1473
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:31,871
It was too,

1474
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:32,770
it was a total bull.

1475
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:33,520
But anyway,

1476
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:33,970
um,

1477
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:36,580
so the other thing that
happened was a friend of mine,

1478
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:37,661
I'm very proud to say,

1479
00:39:37,661 --> 00:39:41,590
called Robert Paxton wrote
a book called Vichy France.

1480
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:46,420
And he had used captured German documents
because the French documents weren't

1481
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,050
open.

1482
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:51,670
They were not available because the big
secret of collaboration should not be

1483
00:39:51,671 --> 00:39:52,504
known.

1484
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,291
And we're going through,

1485
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:53,840
and Francis,

1486
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,240
same thing now with,

1487
00:39:55,241 --> 00:39:55,930
um,

1488
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:56,291
uh,

1489
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:57,880
with war of Algeria too,

1490
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,590
but more about that later.

1491
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:00,851
So,

1492
00:40:00,851 --> 00:40:02,170
give me two more minutes.

1493
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,120
I'm going to end in a few of you.

1494
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:04,830
Uh,

1495
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,490
the faces have heard this before.

1496
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,350
People that I know,

1497
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,160
but,

1498
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:09,460
um,

1499
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,260
I guess one reason why I'm in history,

1500
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:12,521
um,

1501
00:40:12,521 --> 00:40:13,780
well because I read a book a long time,

1502
00:40:13,781 --> 00:40:14,950
but I didn't know what else to do.

1503
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:15,851
Uh,

1504
00:40:15,851 --> 00:40:16,451
and uh,

1505
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:19,600
I'd read what we read one book that
really influenced me but also read a poem.

1506
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,310
And this is kind of a,

1507
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:21,880
uh,

1508
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,091
you know,

1509
00:40:22,091 --> 00:40:24,520
a signature and not my signature,

1510
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:24,761
but,

1511
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:27,280
but the kind of course it is
because you're going to hear about,

1512
00:40:27,281 --> 00:40:28,390
but the gall,

1513
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,460
and you're going to
hear about fancy people,

1514
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:31,270
uh,

1515
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,103
and you know,

1516
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:32,680
Eh,

1517
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,910
but you're also gonna hear about very
ordinary people who were caught up in kind

1518
00:40:36,911 --> 00:40:39,400
of the torrent of the 20th century,

1519
00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:40,960
in the late 19th century.

1520
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,240
So let me just read you this poem.

1521
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:48,330
It is short and it's a Brecht poem
and his called a worker reads history.

1522
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:54,190
Then you can go home or go shop
shop til you drop whatever.

1523
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:57,660
Who built the seven gates of seeds?

1524
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,730
The books are filled
with the names of kings.

1525
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:06,120
Was it kings who hold the craggy blocks
of stone and Babylon so many times

1526
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:07,720
destroyed?

1527
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,960
Who built the city up each time in which
of Lima's houses the city glittering

1528
00:41:13,661 --> 00:41:15,250
with gold live.

1529
00:41:15,251 --> 00:41:20,251
Those who built it in the evening
when the Chinese wall was finished,

1530
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:22,360
where did the masons go?

1531
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:25,930
Imperial Rome is full of Arcs of triumph.

1532
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:30,880
Who reared them up over whom
did the Caesar's triumph?

1533
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,640
Byzantium lives in song.

1534
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:36,050
We're all her dwellings,

1535
00:41:36,051 --> 00:41:36,950
palaces.

1536
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:41,630
And even in Atlantis of the legend,

1537
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:47,110
the night the CS rushed in the drowning
men still bellowed for their slaves.

1538
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,250
Young Alexander conquered India.

1539
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:53,720
He alone,

1540
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:58,580
Caesar beat the Gauls was there
not even a cook in his army.

1541
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,350
Philip of Spain wept as his
fleet was sunk and destroyed.

1542
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:05,450
Were there no other tiers?

1543
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:09,350
Frederick the great triumphed
in the seven years war.

1544
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,180
Who triumphed with him?

1545
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,860
Each page a victory at whose expense?

1546
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:19,250
The victory ball every 10 years.

1547
00:42:19,251 --> 00:42:22,880
A great man who paid the Piper.

1548
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,100
So many particulars.

1549
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,770
So many questions.

1550
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,630
And if you hang around,

1551
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,190
which I hope you will,

1552
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,470
we'll get to the bottom of some of this.

1553
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:34,970
Have a good weekend.
