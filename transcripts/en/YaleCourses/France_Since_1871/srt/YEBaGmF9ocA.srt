1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:05,430
Okay. I'm going to do two things
today, but I know I'm going to,

2
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:08,670
I know I'm going to do, I'm going to
end up talking about what I want to, um,

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,260
and that schools in the role
of schools in identity, but,

4
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:14,370
but uh,
uh,

5
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:18,450
first of all I want to talk a little
bit about the question of one and it's a

6
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:22,260
big historical debate, uh,
when, uh, people in, uh,

7
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:27,261
France began thinking of themselves as
French and then I'm going to specifically

8
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:30,420
look at the role of schools in that.

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,800
And I guess I've got to talk a little
bit about schools today too because you

10
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:34,891
know,

11
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:38,570
identity is something in an age of mass
tourism is a little hard to hold onto.

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,470
So, um, I think I'm going to talk
about that as well at the end.

13
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:46,840
I know, I know I am because
I love talking about it. Um,

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,880
and so I will be repeating just a
couple things that I said the first day,

15
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:54,380
but many of you were shopping or the
things the first day. Um, so the,

16
00:00:54,381 --> 00:00:57,690
the sort of the podium antique or the,
or the question to be resolved is,

17
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,780
you know,
when do did people in France,

18
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:04,170
the majority of the population
or all the population, uh,

19
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:08,820
began thinking themselves as French as
opposed to as opposed to something else?

20
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,160
As I said, the first time,
uh, uh, that in 1789,

21
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:19,161
about half the population of France spoke
French in 1871 about a quarter of the

22
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:25,020
population, uh, spoke French. Um, and so,

23
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:29,760
um, it's, it's a leap of
faith to think that, uh,

24
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:32,900
that what the language you speak,
uh,

25
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,260
in totally informed your identity
or who you think you are. I mean,

26
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:40,530
I gave the case of Alsatians
who spoke, uh, a German who,

27
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:43,440
many of whom consider themselves
French after Alsace. And,

28
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,430
and much of the hand we're, we're,
uh, we're, uh, next, uh, uh,

29
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:51,540
to Germany in 1871.
Now,

30
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:56,430
there was a book published in
a long time ago, uh, uh, uh,

31
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,620
um, by a friend of mine who unfortunately
recently died from an Oam to lack a

32
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,730
wonderful writer called Eugen Weber.
Uh,

33
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,290
that put forward a view that some people
find a convincing in which I don't find

34
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,360
convincing at all. Um, but it is,

35
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,470
it became sort of the Canon or
the accepted assume truth about,

36
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,720
about national identity in France.

37
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,990
Was that a hit in his view until about
1880 until the republic became rooted,

38
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,740
uh,
that you had in a provincial France,

39
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:30,030
and particularly in rural France and
particularly in the south of France,

40
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:35,190
you had, um, a, almost a total
unawareness of, of, of what it was like,

41
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,760
uh, uh, uh, uh, French identity. Um,

42
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,900
somebody in about 1864,
if I remember right, uh,

43
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:44,700
went into a school and the lows as a,

44
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:48,930
which is the Frances least populated
department with only about 77,000 people

45
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:53,520
now live in the Lozier and ask them
what France was. Uh, and the, the,

46
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:57,480
the students in the, in the school,
I had absolutely no idea. Um,

47
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,750
and this particular book marshaled
all sorts of evidence about, uh,

48
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,250
if they're savage beliefs, it's even
put it that, that people believed in it.

49
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,960
It was just a superstitious,
uh, uh, isolated, uh,

50
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,620
rural France,
uh,

51
00:03:12,621 --> 00:03:16,480
in which civilization
honored Vma or in quotes, uh,

52
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:19,270
could only come through,
um,

53
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,580
along with national identity through
these sort of agencies of change.

54
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:28,240
And this is what sociologists used
to call modernization theory, uh,

55
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,880
almost at its worst. And I say this would
be considerable affection for my, uh, uh,

56
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,740
late friend.
I Eugen Weber and we've debated,

57
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,040
had debated this before and the three
big agencies have changed some of what

58
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:42,580
you've already heard a little bit
about. Uh, according to Weber, uh,

59
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:46,870
that transform peasants into Frenchmen
were railroads. That is again,

60
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:50,470
the trunk lines reaching
out from Paris, um, uh,

61
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,790
all railroads leading eventually
to Paris. Um, secondly,

62
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,470
military conscription
teaching people, uh, you know,

63
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:03,610
brought tall, uh, or people
from a gas, can he or, or, uh,

64
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,100
even Leemoo Zap people
from the center of France,

65
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,800
a good French by males anyway,

66
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:13,270
by forcing them to speak
French and serve schools.

67
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,580
That is, uh, the increase in
literacy and France, a dramatic,

68
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,240
uh, in the course of the 19th century, uh,

69
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,250
there was always a big gap
between male literacy literacy.

70
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:28,240
And female literacy and this
gap is, is, is closed, uh,

71
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:33,220
such as by 1900. The vast majority
of people in France can, uh,

72
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:37,330
read, uh, and, and right. How do
we know that by the way? Well,

73
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:40,960
one of the ways that historians have tried
to assess those things in the past is

74
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:44,410
looking at military conscription
records. Uh, or for example,

75
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:48,730
looking at the people who are
witnesses to life's great ceremonies,

76
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,650
births,
marriages,

77
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,800
deaths where they can sign their name
or whether they just simply write an ex,

78
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,260
uh, that they can't,
that they can't sign. Um,

79
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:01,580
and of course there are other ways
of knowing this too, you know,

80
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,810
studying school records and this
sort of thing. So this is the,

81
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,310
the basic kind of interpretation
that became for many people, uh,

82
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:13,970
quite compelling, as I said the other
day. So by 1914, you have these what tall.

83
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,470
Uh, and you know, Britain is a language
has nothing to do with French at all. Uh,

84
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,310
being able to go off to die in
1914 or subsequent years, uh,

85
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,640
seeing than Masias.
Uh,

86
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,700
now the role of language in the
military is an interesting subject.

87
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:29,410
If you take the Austria Hungarian empire,

88
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:31,390
which had at least depending
on how you count it,

89
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,120
12 major national groups or nationalities,
uh,

90
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,720
to get anywhere in the army.

91
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:40,840
And the army was as a kind of social
promotion to become an officer,

92
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:45,400
you had to know German in order to become
a bureaucrat or to become a, you know,

93
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:49,070
a teacher in most parts of the or gear
and empire you need that you needed to

94
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,620
German. And so the argument has
been about Francis. Well, uh,

95
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:57,100
that's the traditional view is that
these, the school teachers, uh,

96
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,250
graduate Lou,

97
00:05:58,251 --> 00:06:02,120
why there's her forcing the Virgin Mary
out of the walls of pub off the walls of

98
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:04,810
public schools,
replacing her with Marianne.

99
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,820
The female image of the republic are
also bringing French to all of the little

100
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:16,250
kids and therefore
civilizing France and uh,

101
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:21,310
turning French peasants into
French men and women or,

102
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:25,580
so that is a conventional view.
Well,

103
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:29,270
I don't agree with that view and I want
it. What I want to do is nuance it.

104
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:34,250
And then a drawing on some of the research
of my friend Joel Francois Shanae. Uh,

105
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,690
talk a little bit about
the role of schools, uh,

106
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:39,110
in the last half of the 19th century.

107
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,290
And then talk a little bit
about the roles of schools now,

108
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,830
because I said I find it interesting
now the whole question of, of,

109
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,360
of timing is essential
in, uh, in, in trying to,

110
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,530
to understand when we can at least,
and this may be sort of a leap of faith,

111
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,000
assume that a French national
identity had prim peer mediated,

112
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,360
all of the did thoughts mall in
France. And of course they could, is a,

113
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,250
is a case apart this even more
complicated. So the question is timing,

114
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,220
but again, simply to repeat
what I said the very first day,

115
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,820
if you look around the map of France,
what did people speak in 1871,

116
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:17,990
what do they speak in 1789? Uh, they
don't always speak those same things. Now,

117
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:19,250
in most cases they don't.

118
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,850
And so that's adjusted to the timing is
crucial in all of this. But just again,

119
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:24,620
I did this the other day, but
what the hell, let's do it again.

120
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,600
Up here in Flanders, uh, many, uh, spoke
Flemish. If you're moving into an Ohioan,

121
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,800
uh, amputated Lohan and, and,
and Alsace Wa, uh, most people,

122
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,930
the vast majority will be
more specific about this.

123
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:39,170
When we talk about the origins of
World War One spoke a German dialect.

124
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:44,171
It's very similar to that spoken in
Fribourg a savoir was a next in 1860.

125
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,470
They spoke a several, yeah.
Uh, language or dialect.

126
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:53,270
It's very much a like a Piedmontese.
Uh, uh, in the case of Italy, I mean,

127
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:54,670
language is fascinating at the time,

128
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:59,000
the unification of Italy at the time of
the unification of Italy and the 1860s

129
00:07:59,001 --> 00:07:59,834
and seventies,

130
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,590
remembering that Medtronic once said
that Italy was a geographic expression,

131
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,440
the percentage of the Italian
population that it spoke.

132
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:09,680
Now what we consider to
be Italian was about 5%.

133
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,000
That is what people spoke Tuscan or
what they speak around around Florence.

134
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,960
So if you move down here and they spoke
Provence Sol, which is a real, you know,

135
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,290
written language and had a revival
with various poets, uh, you know, uh,

136
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,920
in the place called they bull a here,

137
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:29,000
which just turned into kind
of a equivalent of Disney's
sort of a tourist trap.

138
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:32,960
I like so many places in the south,
uh, moving into long door, long dope.

139
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,460
They spoke language of Auc, they spoke
Latin Dosha, uh, and we'll all the,

140
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:42,230
it's Patois, a variance spoken language,
variants and ovarian. They spoken in over.

141
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:43,440
Now Patois,
uh,

142
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,930
down here they spoke [inaudible] I
hear they spoke a patois influenced by

143
00:08:47,931 --> 00:08:49,750
Spanish.
Here they spoke Bosc,

144
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,240
which has nothing to do with anything
outside of a little bit. Oh, Hungarian.

145
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,130
And finish up here. They
spoke, gas gone. Uh, and I,

146
00:08:57,131 --> 00:09:01,240
I gave cases before, people speaking
Patois and even in Normandy and, and,

147
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,720
and even for that matter in, in the valley
of the war. And here they spoke. Uh,

148
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,870
we got tall. I, there's a wonderful book
if you want to, here's a good paper topic.

149
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,350
Uh, take a book called
the Horse of pride, uh,

150
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:16,560
written by a man called Ileus.
He wrote it in that tall,

151
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,740
it was translated into
French and then the English,

152
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:23,970
and it's about growing up in the 1920s
and thirties in, in Phinney staff,

153
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,110
which is the most, the furthest, most
Breton of all that it did pop them all.

154
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,610
And it's about what happens when, you
know, the, uh, the, the outsiders,

155
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:36,070
that is the French speaking to come and
they start calling the French Kodak,

156
00:09:36,071 --> 00:09:40,320
hers because they come with Kodak Cameras.
And so they become the Kodak.

157
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,240
And so the church says,
you got it.

158
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:45,120
We have to stop all these crazy
superstitions in Brittany.

159
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:48,960
People rubbing statues to cure
themselves from various ailments. I mean,

160
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,880
the most ludicrous was probably a saint
imaginary saint called Saint Saint p sue

161
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,080
Sam piece too. So if you rubbed her,
said prayers to Sam [inaudible],

162
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,340
you probably already got it. You cured
yourself of urinary tract infections,

163
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,920
San P sue. So they send in these, these,

164
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:09,420
these priests who were supposed to
preach in, uh, in, in, in, in French,

165
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,680
in Brittany. This is the 1920s. So
again, the question of timing is crucial.

166
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,600
And at one point he tells us
hilarious story where the priest, uh,

167
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,880
I guess I can remember this when I
was a little tiny boy, uh, you know,

168
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:22,140
the priest would turn around and say,

169
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:27,141
at some point in the mass curiae Eleison
I guess that means Christ has mercy and

170
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:30,060
he would turn around and
all of these Breton's,

171
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,730
particularly all their Breton kids,
he turned around and say, curiae lace.

172
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,330
And then he,

173
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:38,330
he was greeted with gales of laughter
because Curiae Leyson means in Breck tall,

174
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:42,120
purely by coincidence
there are many wagons.

175
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,860
And then they would all laugh at him.

176
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:47,610
And so there was a failure
to understand each other. Uh,

177
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:49,680
and the idea that somehow
these breath tall,

178
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:54,510
we're all kind of plucks where
bumpkins were, were uneducated, uh, uh,

179
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,140
you know,

180
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:00,140
people who could never become part of
the true France because they didn't know

181
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:03,900
French very well. And of course, what the,
what tone do is they moved to Paris in,

182
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:06,800
in large numbers.
And the first thing you see in the garden,

183
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:09,660
we'll Parnoss Parnassus the assistance
still today. It's the social,

184
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,260
the office of social
assistance for Brett Tall. Uh,

185
00:11:12,261 --> 00:11:14,580
and they all live around
the Gome Garmo Montparnasse,

186
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:18,240
which is why so many cafes around the
garment Parnass in Paris are named after

187
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,310
Bretton towns, although the, the
Samburu, uh, [inaudible], you know,

188
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,720
Dino and all that, all
this kind of stuff. Okay.

189
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,130
So what about timing and all
of this? So I mean, it is,

190
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,770
it was Weber completely wrong? No, I mean,
depends on what you're talking about.

191
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,030
If you wanted to talk about when people
in the [inaudible] begin thinking of

192
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:37,650
themselves as French,
uh,

193
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:42,690
the answer is really in the 17th
century or in the 18th century,

194
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,440
and certainly the French revolution,
which precipitates is enormous.

195
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:50,130
Civil war in the West was
basically a war between,

196
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,310
between a jackal band that has Paris
centralizing French and people speaking

197
00:11:56,021 --> 00:11:58,420
Patois, who resisted, uh,

198
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,830
in the name of religion and in their
name of their nobles who resisted, uh,

199
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,520
the influence of the French state.
And if you're going to take, I mean,

200
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:08,830
Alsace and Lorraine
were conquered by Louis,

201
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,430
the 14th would have conquered
to Wyoming if he could have, uh,

202
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:17,500
and they become France in a French
in the 17th century. So there is,

203
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,770
there was a shared identity there.
You can have more than one identity.

204
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:22,840
You have more than one identity
in your lives yourself.

205
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:27,841
So it's kind of silly to look for this
one national identity that emerges if you

206
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:33,460
wanted to. Uh, one of the,
the, the historical facts,

207
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,660
it's bad news for this kind of
general oversimplified, uh, uh,

208
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:42,270
interpretation is a series of events that
doesn't concern you in this course. Um,

209
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,470
and that is the revolution of 1848.

210
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:49,120
There's a big revolution in 1848 it would
begins as an urban revolution in Paris.

211
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:52,960
And then Raul and, and limos and
Leone and all sorts of places, uh,

212
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:57,961
becomes basically a rural movement of
people on the left in this much of the

213
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:02,710
center. But, but on a much, even
more of the south of France.

214
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,630
And it ends in 1851 when, uh, Louis, uh,

215
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,850
when Louis Napoleon, the prince, uh,

216
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,170
who had guy who would become
a prince president who'll be,

217
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,290
will become Napoleon the third,
uh,

218
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,150
when he has a coup d'etat on
the 2nd of December, 1851. Um,

219
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,020
and people in Paris work wake up with
pill boxes. But what happens next,

220
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,090
and don't write this down,
but it's good to know,

221
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:30,010
is that it gives rise to the
largest national insurrection
in France in the 19th

222
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:32,260
century to defend the republic.

223
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:36,850
And most the secret societies that
were formed have a lot to do with this.

224
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:40,330
Um, I once read the interrogation
of great, great, great,

225
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:42,400
great uncle of our neighbor who had,

226
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:44,510
was arrested for trying
to defend the Republican.

227
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,480
His interrogation had to be translated
from Patois into French. And so,

228
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,340
uh, in departments I will go to the
mall, but from the periods OIM towel to,

229
00:13:54,341 --> 00:13:58,870
to the Ode to, to the, to the
gap, the whole of the gap, uh,

230
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:04,120
the, the buzz ALP or now it's called the,
the, the, the provost, uh, the dog home,

231
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:09,040
the all dash and all these
places, uh, they rise up to
try to defend the republic.

232
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:13,900
And the vast majority of those people
that did were peasants and many of them do

233
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:16,210
not speak French.
Now,

234
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:19,750
political action is a form of
establishing one's own national identity.

235
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,290
They were fighting for a French republic.
One of the ironies is that people,

236
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:27,340
for example, in Catalonia, we're fighting,

237
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,620
we're fighting in Katella in the cats
that language for, for a jackal, Bam,

238
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:36,430
view a of the left held by the
left, that would, that would,

239
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,610
would view their own language as
something antithetical to progress of the

240
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:46,390
civilization that people thought was
represented by, by the French language.

241
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:51,110
So the, so the question of timing here,
you could argue that for this area here,

242
00:14:51,111 --> 00:14:54,110
which was extremely backward,
do I hate that word? Uh,

243
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,470
the Leemoo Zap these departments here and
you don't have to know that it did pop

244
00:14:57,471 --> 00:14:58,304
them all, but, but the,

245
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,990
the coaches the co has and the old van
or I used to live in, in the old VN,

246
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,500
I don't have much affection for it
actually, but, but, uh, that the,

247
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:07,460
that these areas,

248
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,470
the timing is much earlier than 1880s
and they didn't have to wait for trains.

249
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:17,690
I'm military conscription or even to be
able to know the French language visa vi

250
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,940
this school.
Um,

251
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,450
and so there's some more things that
it could be said also in terms of

252
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:28,100
explaining the, how complicated this
whole question of identity, uh, is.

253
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,500
Um,
and that we have a tendency,

254
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,200
people who believe in modernization
and everything has to pass through

255
00:15:33,201 --> 00:15:36,980
modernization. You know, believe
that history runs on railroad tracks.

256
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:41,560
And all you have to know is when the
train arrives in the station and the,

257
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:44,420
that you forget people along the
way. A friend of mine once said, is,

258
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:48,290
it's bitter hard to write
the history of remainders.

259
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,780
That's something that has
always haunted me, that phrase,

260
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,810
people who weren't modern.
And therefore, you know,

261
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,070
aren't interesting and shouldn't
be studied. But in fact, uh,

262
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,190
the roads,
the,

263
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,170
the increase in roads in the 18th century,

264
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,090
the improvements in roads in the 18th
and the first half of the 19th century

265
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:13,270
were more important than railroads were
in achieving in many parts of France.

266
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,760
This kind of integration,
a peak. And furthermore,

267
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,020
if you look at the expansion of
the French economy, and again,

268
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,660
the only where we're thinking about is
timing, don't worry about these details,

269
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,010
just to having you think about
national identity. Um, it,

270
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:35,130
the French economy expanded rapidly in
the 1820s and thirties and forties and

271
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:39,890
again in the 1850s and sixties when
railroads at something to do with the 50s

272
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:44,770
and 60s. But it expands with
the improvement of, of, uh,

273
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:49,490
of roads that bring
people into towns that,

274
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,330
uh,

275
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:55,330
make them aware of the foss and make
them aware of politics and what these,

276
00:16:55,671 --> 00:16:56,720
all these departments,

277
00:16:56,721 --> 00:17:01,660
they're 18 of them that rose up
in 1851 that rural people before,

278
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:05,550
you know, as a drop there and run across
the fields and dumped their pitchforks.

279
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,710
And there were hunting rifles
as the troops come. But
you know, all of, you know,

280
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:12,500
all every one of these people,
you know,

281
00:17:12,501 --> 00:17:16,160
what they really had in common was that,
that they,

282
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,700
they were in areas in which
the market had expanded, uh,

283
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:24,701
in the 1820s and the 1830s
through better roads.

284
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,350
So again, I mean,
railroads were important.

285
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,560
The first railroad ride that
many people took in France.

286
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,800
We're pilgrimage sites to
[inaudible] and things like that.

287
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:37,310
More about that another time.
But that's not all that's important.

288
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,290
And if you just look for what is modern,

289
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,700
that is like the Tj VA or the godawful
trains going to New York, uh, you know,

290
00:17:43,701 --> 00:17:48,020
from here, uh, then you miss a lot of
the action. So the timing is important.

291
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:53,340
But what about, you know, 1914 did
these Breton's who were conscripted,

292
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,383
do they really,

293
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:58,830
really know much about France that they're
going off to fight for and to die for?

294
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:00,930
Well,
that's a leap of faith is as well.

295
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,400
Certainly it's true that the French
language spreads among breath tall,

296
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,760
uh,
through the war experience.

297
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:13,530
Those people lucky enough to have survive
there weren't in the 1,500,000 dead.

298
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:14,400
Uh,

299
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,260
but that's coming during the war is not
necessarily coming before the war at

300
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,200
all.
Furthermore,

301
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,820
just because one didn't speak
French, did that, you know,

302
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:31,410
condemn people to, to uh, you
know, eternal backwardness.

303
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:36,420
You know, I've studied strikes in
the motion 1905, and before that,

304
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,600
in which the workers who were striking
against big companies against Havilland

305
00:18:41,811 --> 00:18:46,710
the porcelain, oh, that's another story.
The Havilland American porcelain company,

306
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,790
they were chanting long live. The
social republic, not in French,

307
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:55,710
but in Patois, but in Patois,
uh, in a was amp Antoine,

308
00:18:55,711 --> 00:18:58,530
not in French. Does this mean they
don't, they're not French. No.

309
00:18:58,531 --> 00:19:01,340
Doesn't mean that at all. It, but
it just means that the, you know,

310
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,250
part of their identity is being from that
particular part of France and you can

311
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:07,410
have multiple identities.
Uh,

312
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,220
and so the sort of simplistic view of
when these people start seeing themselves

313
00:19:11,221 --> 00:19:15,930
as, as French is extraordinary
complicated. What about Corsica? You know,

314
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:19,570
you still got about seven or 8% of
the population. That's just a guess.

315
00:19:19,571 --> 00:19:22,410
Who Don't want to be French at all.
You still a people blowing up.

316
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:27,360
Occasionally these, uh, you know, a high
rise apartments, condominiums, you know,

317
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:31,830
uh, in coursing, cause they don't
want tourists there, uh, in, uh,

318
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,700
in August. And, uh, you know,
to extent, I mean, you know,

319
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:37,440
I'm not for blowing up anything
but who can blame them,

320
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:41,460
not wanting tourists there in August. And
we were just blighted by, by tourists,

321
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,000
um, you know, uh, in the
south. Um, so I mean,

322
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:47,820
it just is terribly
complicated. And, and of course,

323
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,430
in the case of Brittany is
classic, um, you know, it's, uh,

324
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:56,220
gradually the French language
moves in this direction. Uh,

325
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,520
and,
but still in the 1920s and thirties,

326
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,700
the overwhelming percentage
of the population still
speak [inaudible] in daily

327
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:09,270
life. I mean, what about just an aside,
one of thousands of asides, but, but what,

328
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:13,270
you know, what about, what about
time since World War Two, uh,

329
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:17,370
before I get to schools, what
is, people speak, when do,

330
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,920
when does patois disappear?
Well,

331
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:23,280
I've always been interested in that
because we live in a village of about 339

332
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:26,810
people. Uh, the very old population,

333
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,670
the church bell rings
slowly, very, very often.

334
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:33,330
And another of us has been snatched away,
uh,

335
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:38,360
sadly in the south and this part of
France and the, and the owl dash in,

336
00:20:38,361 --> 00:20:41,710
in what you call the viva. Hey, the
[inaudible], it doesn't matter. Um,

337
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:46,230
people spoke Patois in daily life.
I in,

338
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,780
uh,
the 1920s and 1930s,

339
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:55,000
and then people who were old, I
would speak at, among themselves,

340
00:20:55,390 --> 00:21:00,040
uh, in the 1940s, 1950s. But
people that I know that are old,

341
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,120
including my boule
partner, you know, boom,

342
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,660
we played Wu and we direct a little
Sheldon a, aren't I supposed to say that?

343
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:08,240
But we did a little chardonnay on the
cider or posties calcap pasties to Tom on

344
00:21:08,241 --> 00:21:11,500
Thong, uh, by the talks. I don't
want to have the autonomy, you know,

345
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:15,610
the pay people there. They're playing my
friend who was 80, uh, he could under,

346
00:21:15,611 --> 00:21:20,350
he can understand Patois, but he can,
he can't read it and he can't write it.

347
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:22,130
When I asked him to correct,
uh,

348
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,130
some sentences that I
had copied in Patois, uh,

349
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,280
in a book that I did for the French
translation, he couldn't do it.

350
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,350
So that's disappeared. But say on, over
in, Oh, van, you, I mean, you know,

351
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,750
Varner or these departments here,
uh, w going to go through them all,

352
00:21:37,751 --> 00:21:40,190
but have you all come towel
o'dwyer, you know, et Cetera.

353
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,090
Quita dome up here maybe will
be a, uh, a little bit in that,

354
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,880
in the 1960s and early 1970s,

355
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:53,140
Patois was still spoken
in many households.

356
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:57,670
And when the classic kind of eternal
triangle that is the parents,

357
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,290
the school kid and the
teacher was often then,

358
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:06,400
and it had something to do with language
because the parents felt themselves at

359
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:09,670
a disadvantage because they're French
wasn't as good as their patois.

360
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:13,690
This isn't the 1860s,
this is the 1960s. Um,

361
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,040
and in Corsica, you know,
there's still people to speak,
you know, a can, a language,

362
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,870
but basically almost everybody now speaks,
speaks French. And even in the movie,

363
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:24,760
I mentioned this the other
day, but you want enough, uh,

364
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:29,880
to flow hat and all of that. I mean,
there they had to equip the, the, the,

365
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,160
the main one of the main
actors, uh, uh, Daniel a toy.

366
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,210
They had to train him even though he's
from Avi know how to speak with a real

367
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:41,260
Provence style, uh, uh, accent.
But that, but that, but that,

368
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,290
that's false because in
the, in the, in the 1920s,

369
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,440
when he comes back from World War One,
uh,

370
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,330
they're going to be speaking or they're
going to be speaking a Provence saw.

371
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:56,170
They're not going to be speaking
French. Now what about, well,

372
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,230
I don't even have time to get into
this, but about universities, uh,

373
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:03,050
one of the things that's been good
in the last 20 years in France, uh,

374
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,020
is that before, I mean, as I said,

375
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:09,730
the goal wanted to crush regional
languages and cultures like grapes. Uh,

376
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:13,630
but one of the things has happened is
that now universities are very active in

377
00:23:13,631 --> 00:23:18,631
teaching these languages that are part
of the regional identity that is not a

378
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:23,230
necessarily antithetical at all to
the sense of being French. I mean,

379
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:27,590
University of, of, of naught,
which is horribly right
wing. But then, uh, you know,

380
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,990
the event in particular
teaches, uh, uh, teachers, uh,

381
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,490
tall and there's been a revival.
There are Pepin y'all very,

382
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,390
very strong and Kathleen
last studies and to lose,

383
00:23:37,391 --> 00:23:40,570
which is a very good university
there though, it's, uh,
the, the city is wonderful,

384
00:23:40,571 --> 00:23:43,960
but the university has a dump. And also
when we had the big explosion there, uh,

385
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:48,320
that we were there when that all happened
in the fall of 2001 where, you know,

386
00:23:48,321 --> 00:23:51,560
there were some even more
horrible explosions in this
country, as you well know.

387
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,470
Uh,
you know,

388
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:57,320
the whole campus was sort of moved by
this ignore a huge explosion when this

389
00:23:57,321 --> 00:24:00,170
chemical factory, uh,
uh, blew up. But there,

390
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:04,850
there's been a revival in the
teaching of, of oxy town. Uh,

391
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,360
you know, these sort of lone
duck languages that were, uh,

392
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,140
soon to disappear, et
Cetera, et cetera. Now,

393
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:16,340
so be a little cautious in assuming that,
well,

394
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:21,260
everybody in 1914 felt themselves French
or thinking that these are agencies of

395
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:25,460
modernization are what,
what created this,

396
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:30,380
what we'd have to admit is, is a
strong French, uh, uh, French identity.

397
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,350
But also one of the things
I'm able to see, you know,

398
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:34,300
I'll probably be in tears by the end,

399
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,170
the lecture because I'm so
afraid that these regional
identities, uh, uh, you know,

400
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:42,000
are, are going to disappear and
that tourism may, may, uh, you know,

401
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,510
have something to do with that as well.

402
00:24:44,511 --> 00:24:47,540
And that would be too bad with the end
of these license plates and things like

403
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:52,430
that. That, that, that I, I mentioned,
uh, uh, before, uh, that's not impossible.

404
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,130
Ironically, those of you, anyone
who's been to France or been anywhere,

405
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,340
I know that the Greek, the, the,

406
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:01,580
the green guid Mishnah in a
way that may have even had,

407
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:06,581
along with the gastronomy guides as a
way of at least making people think about

408
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:07,760
regional culture,

409
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,980
tying it closely to what is unique
about a region and presenting it to,

410
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,840
to tourists. And what's unique
about cuisine. Uh, and some of it,

411
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,680
none of them really famous. And now you
know, if you want to spend disown 12, uh,

412
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:24,320
saint [inaudible] for one person to eat
in these places is $250 per person. Uh,

413
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:28,670
some of them even a emphasize,
so emphasize their local
origins of what their,

414
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:33,470
uh, what they're preparing that this
may have. This may work against the,

415
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:38,570
this sort of onslaught of, of this, uh,
single, uh, French of culture. And so,

416
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:43,430
well, let this, all these flowers
continue to bloom. Now what about schools?

417
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,430
I mean, certainly Weber,
like anyone else's, right?

418
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,880
The schools make a huge difference.
And the history of,

419
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
of school houses is very interesting
now basically until 1833 until 1833.

420
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,440
And I'll explain why 1833 and a manner.
Um,

421
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,890
there are two things that
can be said about, uh,

422
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:10,030
the teaching of anything or three things.
One is that girls were,

423
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,760
were much likely less likely
to go to school. Uh, then, uh,

424
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:18,750
boys a second that many school
teachers were [inaudible], which were,

425
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,770
um, you know, mobile, the,

426
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:25,280
there are people who simply would go
from town to town teaching for a month or

427
00:26:25,281 --> 00:26:29,010
two. Um, and that villages, uh,

428
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,410
some are very resourceful and we would
start schools taking advantage of one of

429
00:26:33,411 --> 00:26:34,850
these people.
Uh,

430
00:26:34,851 --> 00:26:39,851
but that the church education
was primarily dominated
by the Catholic Church,

431
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,480
uh, and education in the
informal sense as well. Now,

432
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:48,090
to be sure 5% of the French
population were Protestants.

433
00:26:48,091 --> 00:26:51,810
More about that when we get to
the Dreyfus affair. Uh, but, uh,

434
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,000
the priest was often in
the 18th century, uh, uh,

435
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:01,010
the only person who could read in many
villages and his reading knowledge would

436
00:27:01,771 --> 00:27:06,020
be basically limited to the
Bible or repeating things
that he'd been trained, uh,

437
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:11,010
to say. Uh, but the church and
the teaching sisters, the nuns,

438
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,020
uh, uh, really, uh,

439
00:27:13,021 --> 00:27:17,040
dominate in many parts of France
and places that were practicing,

440
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:20,490
still practicing that old time religion,
dominant education.

441
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:23,220
Now in 1833 a law comes,

442
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:26,420
a law comes along called the Gisele La.

443
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:31,030
He's all was a protestant from neem. He
was not what the French would call real.

444
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,490
No, he was not. Uh, uh,

445
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:36,990
he was not a very happy go lucky guy is
you want to have a couple of beers with

446
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:40,650
are a couple of seven ups with
um, but he, and he was Protestant.

447
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:45,330
And so what he wanted to do was to rest
education away from the clutches of the

448
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:49,230
Catholic churches. He sought.
So through his inspiration,

449
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:54,030
they pass a law that says that
in every village in France,

450
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,600
in every one of Francis 36,000 communes,

451
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,070
you had to have a school.

452
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,900
Now the reality was that many were so
poor that they couldn't in our particular

453
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:06,090
village. And I'll have to make
reference to this cause I've, I've,

454
00:28:06,091 --> 00:28:07,920
I've studied a little bit, you know, they,

455
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:11,760
the school moves from rented
place to rented place,

456
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,940
but 1833 matters because the school
teacher now has the stamp of official

457
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:23,300
authority. He is supposed to teach
in French. Now how do you know that?

458
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:27,540
When I say he has a stamp of official
authority, what does that mean?

459
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,760
So I got curious as to what that means
and to see what difference he made.

460
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:37,850
I did the following Wa, which is
that, as I said before, the, the,

461
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:41,160
the, the big rights of life, birth

462
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,740
bet. Well, baptism, marriage,
death have to be witnessed.

463
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:52,230
And since the French revolution, this is
kept by the state, not by the parishes.

464
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,890
So you have to have people who
witnessed it, who say, I see this baby,

465
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,510
I sign on the dotted line.

466
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,150
Now usually what you do in a small
village is you would take, uh,

467
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,530
some notable person who
knew how to read or write,

468
00:29:04,531 --> 00:29:08,880
perhaps your rear wealthy uncle
or somebody wealthy uncle.

469
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:13,530
And then you'd cause a person who can
sign his name. And then you'd take, uh,

470
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,341
you know, your, your,

471
00:29:14,341 --> 00:29:18,240
your cousin who may probably couldn't
sign his name but can make a pretty good

472
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:22,260
acts when push comes to shop with 1833,

473
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,080
I started looking at all
these registers, uh, you know,

474
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:27,370
just for a day that'll do it. But, uh,

475
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,730
I look at all the birth and all
the baptisms and all the day,

476
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,100
I mean all the Baptisms, all, all
the marriages and all the deaths.

477
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,930
And what happens is this proud
signature of the schoolteacher.

478
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:42,170
He becomes this sort of that obligatory
but the chosen person to say,

479
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,420
I have seen this baby.
I have seen this couple,

480
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:51,150
I have seen this corpse. And so,
and does that tell you something?

481
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:55,330
Was French school teachers still have this
wonderful signature that my kids were,

482
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,710
you know who right. Terribly of terrible
signatures like mine were never able to,

483
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,980
to pick up. But that tells
you something because he has,

484
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,340
he's supposed to get a
minimum salary of 200 francs,

485
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:10,180
which is virtually nothing because some
people are paying them an in asparaguses,

486
00:30:10,181 --> 00:30:15,100
depending on, or are on end dives or an
apples are not pairing it with paying it.

487
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,810
All families that were too
poor were exonerated, uh,
from having to pay anything.

488
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,860
Uh, and he's just barely scraping
by, but he doesn't have a red,

489
00:30:23,861 --> 00:30:26,830
white and blue sash like the mayor does.

490
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:32,490
But he represents the state
and the authority and above
all the prestige of the

491
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:39,610
state. And he's a challenge
in his very existence to,

492
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,970
uh, the Virgin Mary being on the wall, uh,

493
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:47,140
of these public schools.
These are public schools.

494
00:30:47,141 --> 00:30:49,450
So now in 1850,
this is before the course,

495
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:51,220
it doesn't matter that there's
a law called the fall Lula,

496
00:30:51,221 --> 00:30:55,240
which you can forget as soon as I
said it. Um, uh, and in the flu law,

497
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,110
a really,
it's a compromise with the church and,

498
00:30:58,111 --> 00:31:02,620
and Louis Napoleon hands back control
over local committees to the church.

499
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:06,620
And in parts of France, which
people still, uh, you know,

500
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,680
still practice religion.

501
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:13,730
Religion still mattered in private and
public life to the Greta always had been,

502
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:19,240
you still have people that want to have
church schools and the north of France,

503
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,340
you know, when you're reading
Jeremy now you have to also map,

504
00:31:21,341 --> 00:31:24,070
you've got these Belgian nuns
with these wild, you know,

505
00:31:24,071 --> 00:31:27,100
hats that they used to have
still teaching in the schools.

506
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:31,330
You have convent people coming down the
ignore little literacy, not very much.

507
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,760
And they're teaching,
they're doing the best they can.

508
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,860
The quality of the clergy and France
was never higher than in, in the,

509
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:41,410
in the 18th century. It was pretty low
in the 19th century. But still, you know,

510
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:46,500
you have these competing sources
to educate the young people.

511
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:51,820
Dell parents often resist
their kids going to school.

512
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,010
Why would they want to do that?
Well,

513
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:56,560
mothers are responsible
for the household economy.

514
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,490
You have to have enough money
to keep the household going.

515
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,960
And for very many people and not
just workers and peasants. Uh,

516
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,950
it was difficult to explain
what difference in the long
run it mattered if their

517
00:32:08,951 --> 00:32:13,870
child learned how to do more than the
very minimum of learning how to read and

518
00:32:13,871 --> 00:32:17,830
write. So I got ahold of some
statistics on truancy for example.

519
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,720
And that was pretty interesting to see,
you know,

520
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:24,070
and it's quite clear that whenever
there was a harvest, uh, uh, soap,

521
00:32:24,071 --> 00:32:26,620
warm harvest and much of
the southeast of France,

522
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,560
a wine harvest in champagne or,

523
00:32:29,561 --> 00:32:34,270
or in burgundy are involved or are long
dork almost anywhere or the various

524
00:32:34,271 --> 00:32:37,660
harvest, uh, you know, the beginning
July, usually with the grain,

525
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:40,520
I mean the kids just didn't go to school
because they weren't needed there.

526
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,360
But there's always this tension
because parents said, you know,

527
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:47,000
my little girl should be in say pay or
my little boy should it be in state pay,

528
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:48,530
which is the equivalent of first grade,

529
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,820
but I need her or I need him
to watch the small animals.

530
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:55,970
The big kids watched the big animals.
That's the way it is.

531
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,230
The big kids go on the trumps who malls.

532
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,190
That is when you take the sheep up
into the mountains. We still have,

533
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,440
we still have that every year.
We still,

534
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:06,380
my kids go on the tour or at least one
I'm going to have the transfer moss with

535
00:33:06,381 --> 00:33:09,260
the sheep going up in the mountains
and they would say there's no way I'm

536
00:33:09,261 --> 00:33:13,520
sending my kid to school. But in Francis
you'll read from chips, our wines book,

537
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:17,810
they put in laws as they do in Italy
as they do in Germany and as they do in

538
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:22,280
Britain that says you don't have any
choice but to Schwab you have to go to

539
00:33:22,281 --> 00:33:27,281
school and you have to be there until
the age of 11 or the age of 12 so the

540
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:34,541
assumption is in this kind of view of
how this all works is that these guys,

541
00:33:36,051 --> 00:33:40,610
these teachers, male teachers,
increasingly women teachers later,

542
00:33:40,611 --> 00:33:43,480
but only later it becomes
a job along with the,

543
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:46,280
we'll talk about some other time along
with department store clerks and,

544
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,400
and when clerks becoming more
female as opposed to mail.

545
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:54,470
It becomes a way for peasant
girls and working class
girls or young women, uh, uh,

546
00:33:54,471 --> 00:33:56,140
to get jobs.
But the view is that,

547
00:33:56,141 --> 00:34:00,440
that these teachers who are called
as steeped in French assay to tour,

548
00:34:00,441 --> 00:34:02,990
but just teachers,
these primary school teachers,

549
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,540
virtually nobody went to [inaudible].
It goes to high school.

550
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:08,390
Hardly anyone goes to
at least say, uh, uh,

551
00:34:08,391 --> 00:34:12,320
until really until the second half of
the 19th century that these people are

552
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:16,730
teaching the French language and that
this is how you're going to learn it.

553
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,380
And there's always a story told
almost every place. How in school,

554
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,830
even during recess,
recreation recess,

555
00:34:24,831 --> 00:34:29,831
the last person who says a word in Patois
has to clutch for the remainder of the

556
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:30,741
period.

557
00:34:30,741 --> 00:34:35,741
Some oddly shaped rock or coin until
somebody else screws up and says,

558
00:34:36,081 --> 00:34:38,810
award in Patois.
Are you kidding me?

559
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:42,470
That doesn't work like that at all.
And uh,

560
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:47,330
John Francois Shanay started,
he went out to study in the 18,

561
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:47,670
uh,

562
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:52,670
a 50s and 60s and 1870s
school teachers and schools.

563
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,040
And he begins with surveys,

564
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:58,310
some of which have I read that they
asked sexual teachers what you want for

565
00:34:58,311 --> 00:35:01,660
yourself, what you want
for your village, uh,

566
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,540
for your school and what
do you want for your kids,

567
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:09,710
what you want for your kids. And they
would reply. But you know, these guys,

568
00:35:09,711 --> 00:35:14,190
they're filling out forms that their
superiors in this hierarchical centralized

569
00:35:14,191 --> 00:35:17,570
society are going to look at.
And if they write, you know,

570
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,370
basically they don't understand French.

571
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,330
We talk about the great battles of
Napoleon, but we do it in over and yeah,

572
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:28,000
you know, in Patois or we do an in
line dossiya or we do it in cat to La,

573
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,100
you know, then they're going to get
themselves in trouble. So you have to,

574
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,420
you have to sort of sneak around a little
bit these sources and the more Shanae

575
00:35:35,421 --> 00:35:36,530
looked at these places,

576
00:35:36,531 --> 00:35:41,430
it's clear that regional identity
is still very important. You know,

577
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:46,431
the famous map of France or the famous
map of the world that had in the 1890s

578
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:49,140
after the big period of new imperialism,

579
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:54,170
you're the color of France in its colonies
in Senegal. Or when that was Molly or,

580
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:57,210
or, or, or, or union or anywhere. Um,

581
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:00,660
but you have to begin with a region.
And so they're beginning with a region.

582
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:04,560
If they're from the alf it from
[inaudible] or from around won't pell Yay.

583
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,740
You know, that is their frame
of identity. And so it's,

584
00:36:07,741 --> 00:36:12,390
it's absurd to think that they weren't
actually teaching in these languages,

585
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,700
uh,
local languages and dialects.

586
00:36:14,701 --> 00:36:19,620
And patois justice is absurd to think
that people who didn't master French

587
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:24,360
perfectly or even very well at all didn't
have some, depending on the timing,

588
00:36:24,361 --> 00:36:26,850
some sense of being French.
Uh,

589
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,630
so these schools are terribly important
and they could be teaching about,

590
00:36:30,631 --> 00:36:33,240
you know, all of this stuff they
had to learn about, you know,

591
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:37,320
the kings of France and all this crap
that they still learn over and over again.

592
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:37,711
And you know,

593
00:36:37,711 --> 00:36:41,460
they're teaching that stuff in Patois
and in dialect and maybe in the north of

594
00:36:41,461 --> 00:36:42,660
France. I mean, you have to,

595
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,630
everybody's always talking about this
imaginary lines from some are low to

596
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:50,200
Jeanette here and is mostly in the south
of France where these languages, uh,

597
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,001
persist.

598
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:55,410
And I don't mean persist in a derogatory
sense where they continue to thrive,

599
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:00,180
but, but so, but this
bilingualism will, uh,

600
00:37:00,181 --> 00:37:05,070
continue. Uh, and also, I mean a
lot of the lot of the views of,

601
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:10,080
of the sort of backward provinces are
written by regions or by military officers

602
00:37:11,161 --> 00:37:11,641
for example,

603
00:37:11,641 --> 00:37:15,590
who show up and they find some peasant
walking down the street and say, Hey, you,

604
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,760
you know,
can you give me this information?

605
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:21,270
And that the person understands
perfectly well what they want,

606
00:37:21,271 --> 00:37:25,860
but they identify some person coming with
speaking French is a tax collector or

607
00:37:25,861 --> 00:37:28,620
a military guy or something like that.
And your APP,

608
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:32,070
just to give that secret smile and
pretend like you don't understand a damn

609
00:37:32,071 --> 00:37:35,730
thing just to secret smile and then
they go back then and right. Boy,

610
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:38,970
I've never done people here. They can't
speak French at all. They are hopeless.

611
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:43,770
They are out of date. They are
prueck, they are, you know,
bumpkins and all of that.

612
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:44,903
Uh,
so,

613
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:48,960
but I mean eventually as I said that you
have these school houses that they will

614
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:53,700
improve over time. They
get more resources. They're
made to have more resources.

615
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:58,560
Uh, the towns do more and more for
them. A girl's school start up, uh,

616
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,070
uh, a girls' education increases rapidly.
And thus it's quite, you know, these,

617
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:07,080
if you're another Zola, a novel,
which is a great one called Obama. Oh,

618
00:38:07,081 --> 00:38:09,930
Buena I did dom,
which is about department stores,

619
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,990
about the departments are
Beaumarchais in Paris. I mean,

620
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:15,930
for these young women get
really miserable jobs.

621
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:17,480
And what they're doing is
they're, they're, you know,

622
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:21,870
they're sleeping in dormitories and under
horrible sort of draconian regulations

623
00:38:21,871 --> 00:38:24,300
about what they can do.
But for them to get those kinds of jobs,

624
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:26,220
they have to be able to count.
They have to be able to read,

625
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:31,020
they have to be able to write. And so,
uh, women's education increases, uh,

626
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:36,160
dramatically, uh, during this
whole time. Uh, and, but, but what,

627
00:38:36,161 --> 00:38:37,550
what does not,
you know,

628
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:42,570
it does not change is the prestige
that the school teachers have that they

629
00:38:43,211 --> 00:38:47,140
maintained as, as representing
not only national identity,

630
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:50,270
but also regional possibilities.
Uh,

631
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:55,390
and in teaching the youth of France,
how to,

632
00:38:55,660 --> 00:39:00,190
uh, how to, uh, read and write. Um, no,

633
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:02,170
I thought just because, you
know, maybe it might be,

634
00:39:02,171 --> 00:39:06,280
you'll find it interesting for the last
10 minutes since I did what I basically

635
00:39:06,281 --> 00:39:10,610
wanted to do and held myself down and
not given countless and countless of

636
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:15,230
examples is talk a little bit about now,
uh,

637
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,320
because one of the things that I
became interested in is how, you know,

638
00:39:20,321 --> 00:39:25,321
if these areas in the south
particularly that are tourist infested,

639
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:29,200
uh, during the year, if
they are going to remain,

640
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:34,320
remain more than simply sites
for tourists from the north,

641
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:37,960
from Belgium and from Germany and from,
uh,

642
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:43,050
the Netherlands and literally from the
north of France to come and visit schools

643
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,600
have to maintain their traditional role
in representing the identity of these

644
00:39:50,171 --> 00:39:52,180
communities.
And those of you who are,

645
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:56,980
if there any people here from Nebraska
where my wife is from a or from Idaho or

646
00:39:56,981 --> 00:39:57,970
from Oregon,
where I'm from,

647
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,450
from eastern Oregon or from
Wyoming and places like that,

648
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:05,930
we'll know the process by which
schools are closing down, uh,

649
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,290
because they're not enough kids left.

650
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:13,360
France had in 1939, uh, excuse me,

651
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:14,590
an 1851,

652
00:40:14,591 --> 00:40:19,591
two thirds of the departments in France
in 1851 were larger than they were in

653
00:40:20,441 --> 00:40:25,060
1939 because of two things.
One,

654
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,370
the collapsing birth rate,

655
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,640
which I will talk about
another time in much of France,

656
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:35,710
people stop having babies Twan period.
Or they'll have,

657
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,850
you know, 2.1 babies or 1.8 babies.
That's kind of hard, but you know,

658
00:40:39,851 --> 00:40:44,851
in the statistically and second is that
what in French a gone they buy or the

659
00:40:45,731 --> 00:40:50,350
big departure starts as people who
have lost access to common resources,

660
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:50,831
for example,

661
00:40:50,831 --> 00:40:55,450
in the mountains or the silk industry
collapse or the wine industry co collapses

662
00:40:55,451 --> 00:40:57,760
more about that. When I talk
about flocks, red disease,

663
00:40:57,761 --> 00:41:02,170
don't write that down or even tried to
spell it now. Um, there's this huge,

664
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:03,131
uh,
uh,

665
00:41:03,131 --> 00:41:08,131
withdrawal from the countryside toward
more urbanized departments and because

666
00:41:08,351 --> 00:41:12,580
the population has stopped growing,
uh, basically by the, by 1900,

667
00:41:12,581 --> 00:41:13,690
if it wasn't for the arrival of,

668
00:41:13,691 --> 00:41:16,210
of people from Italy and
other places and from Spain,

669
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:20,440
the French population wouldn't
even, uh, uh, reproduce itself.

670
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:23,530
It wouldn't even stay, stay constant. Um,

671
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,610
in much of France. And indeed, uh,

672
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:31,960
I would argue of 36,000 communes.
Uh,

673
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:36,990
let me say that perhaps in 10 or
12,000 Commons after World War Two,

674
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:44,600
there were one room, school houses
and a one room school house. You know,

675
00:41:44,601 --> 00:41:47,540
you've seen movies involving them.
They have them in the United States too.

676
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,110
In a one room school house,

677
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,090
you'll have all the kids have all the
grades being taught by one person.

678
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,680
Our kids for several years in a one room
school house is a great way to grow up.

679
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:01,640
You have in France, you have grades
from first through fifth grade.

680
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,240
They're calling to say, say why, you
know, et cetera. And the oldest kids,

681
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:08,510
if the kid,
if he's he or she is remotely intelligent,

682
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:13,610
will help with the younger ones. Uh, but
everybody's together in the same school.

683
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,110
And with the depopulation population,

684
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:18,560
what they did is they tried
to have single sex schools.

685
00:42:18,561 --> 00:42:20,990
You have a boys' school
and a girls school,

686
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,980
but that becomes too expensive because
the state is paying for all this, uh,

687
00:42:24,981 --> 00:42:27,530
and the communes are paying part of
it. So what they do is they say, okay,

688
00:42:27,531 --> 00:42:31,100
we're going to have one school, it's
called in French, a class unique.

689
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,910
And it's a wonderful way to
grow up, uh, in, you know,

690
00:42:34,911 --> 00:42:37,970
where you've got cats and you have
dogs and you have a, you know,

691
00:42:37,971 --> 00:42:41,900
the older kids are trying to get ready
for their exams, uh, you know, uh,

692
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,330
where they don't have any
more, but we'll have a, uh,

693
00:42:44,331 --> 00:42:47,660
to show that their certificate that
they have been in class through, uh,

694
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,600
your are equivalent here in America of
the fifth grade. And you might have,

695
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,760
if they have a kindergarten,

696
00:42:52,761 --> 00:42:56,140
you might have a little boy or girl
painting in the corner. Literally, uh,

697
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,750
while all this other stuff is going
on. And you know, in our class,

698
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:04,710
a dog gave birth during the middle of
mass, uh, in, in, in our class, in,

699
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,020
in the, in the, in this school.

700
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:11,030
And all of the tests that people have
have had showed that kids with who come

701
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:13,520
out of that environment do just as well.
In fact,

702
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:16,700
even a little better then
people in your normal class,

703
00:43:16,701 --> 00:43:18,710
we've got everybody in the
first grade there, they all are.

704
00:43:18,711 --> 00:43:19,880
And here's the second grade.

705
00:43:19,881 --> 00:43:23,150
And then you've got sort of elite class
for those people who have parents are

706
00:43:23,151 --> 00:43:25,130
pushing enough to get them in that,
you know,

707
00:43:25,131 --> 00:43:27,290
and you've got all that stuff
and some of what you've seen.

708
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:30,080
But what as all of this is expensive?

709
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,440
What's happened over time is that these
one room school houses are closing down

710
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:39,370
and between 1975 about and about night,

711
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:45,340
let's say 1990 10,001 room
school houses in France closed.

712
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:50,240
And what this does is it causes
unemployment for school teachers.

713
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:53,030
But many of them, you know, I
can stay on in other capacities,

714
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,610
but it means that they're long bus rides.
Uh,

715
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:58,190
they're already long bus rides because
many depart, they pop them all,

716
00:43:58,191 --> 00:43:59,390
don't have that many high schools.

717
00:43:59,391 --> 00:44:01,940
And you've got to take buses in
order to get to the high schools.

718
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:04,760
And that sort of thing.
And you know, and, and,

719
00:44:04,761 --> 00:44:09,640
and that is sad because that's a
wonderful way to uh, grow up, uh, in,

720
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:12,140
in, in these schools. And that's part of,

721
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:15,650
of regional identity and village
identity that's going to disappear.

722
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,770
And let me give you an example again
from our village cause it's interesting.

723
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:24,170
We were faced with uh, uh, with uh, the
fact that the school was going to be,

724
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:28,910
uh, either grouped with another
village, detested, rival, uh,

725
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,220
or be shut down.
So what do our kids are supposed to do?

726
00:44:32,221 --> 00:44:35,100
Where are they supposed
to go to school? And, um,

727
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:38,860
one day we were convoked
to the town hall to the Ma.

728
00:44:38,861 --> 00:44:42,970
He by our school teacher and
our, most of our parents, uh,

729
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,900
meetings with the school teacher
ended with a bottle of ARMAGNAC.

730
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,470
I'm pleased to say,
and we're all dear friends,

731
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:52,410
even the people that you're not your
friends with, you got along with fine.

732
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:54,660
But remember what I said
about the role of the school.

733
00:44:54,661 --> 00:44:57,290
The school represented from the,

734
00:44:57,291 --> 00:45:02,291
the outside France looking into the
village in principal teaching French,

735
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:05,730
providing opportunities for people
to get educated and get a school,

736
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:09,720
get a job in the post office or the
train station or in a department store in

737
00:45:09,721 --> 00:45:13,020
Paris avenue to lose or wherever.

738
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,220
And one day we were Convult by the mayor
and the mayor then wasn't a friend of

739
00:45:17,221 --> 00:45:21,280
ours is somebody we knew and
he had a sash on and he said,

740
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:23,880
Woo instead of two,
you know,

741
00:45:23,881 --> 00:45:28,020
he spoke to us formally and this teacher
was nervous. He said, God, he said,

742
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:31,780
we have the great pleasure, hey and a
man and we're all looking at it and say,

743
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:35,130
wow, you know, kids go, you know
Mr of the mayor is going to hear,

744
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,450
he's going to be here to talk
to us and we're all nervous.

745
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:39,720
Get quote where our school
is maybe going to close down.

746
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:44,930
We'd started a semi illegal canteen to
feed the kids lunch room so the parents

747
00:45:45,271 --> 00:45:46,800
wouldn't put their kids
in the other school.

748
00:45:46,801 --> 00:45:49,290
At one point we only had
nine kids left in the school.

749
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:53,030
We can get close down and were a little
nervous and the, and the guy says, uh,

750
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,460
my friends, which he's
not a, we're not, he said,

751
00:45:56,461 --> 00:46:01,461
we're gathered here together so that we
can best see how we can cheat the state.

752
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,450
And the minute he said, cheat the
state, we had an alliance, all of us,

753
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,800
because how are we going to keep us some
illegal lunchroom going so that we can

754
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:14,790
keep a couple more little kids in our
school? How are we going to do that?

755
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:17,460
And I realized then that the
relationship had totally changed,

756
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:20,520
that the school still represents France.

757
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:25,050
It's a cruel system where you'll be in
the fourth grade and their teachers will

758
00:46:25,051 --> 00:46:26,530
call your parents and say,
you know,

759
00:46:26,531 --> 00:46:29,730
votes with fee at a noon that happened
to one of my daughter's friends,

760
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:31,170
your daughter,
she's nothing.

761
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:35,220
She has to go off and do this menial job
because she's never going to make it to

762
00:46:35,221 --> 00:46:38,250
the next level. There's always tension.
There's parents meetings. I mean,

763
00:46:38,251 --> 00:46:41,520
it's a cruel system, but, but
it was the outside looking in,

764
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:45,120
it represented the possibilities
of France and the French language,

765
00:46:45,121 --> 00:46:47,160
which we've already exists.
We've exaggerated.

766
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:50,880
And I suddenly realized that now it's
very different. And then if our village,

767
00:46:50,881 --> 00:46:55,881
it's like all of these other villages
are good to remain living v Wall and more

768
00:46:56,971 --> 00:46:57,660
than just a,

769
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:02,660
a Michelin Infuse Spec on the dot where
people will come along with their,

770
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:06,990
their, their green guides.
Because it's so beautiful.

771
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,000
And this is true of all of these places.

772
00:47:09,001 --> 00:47:13,020
They're not all equally beautiful that
our school has to survive because even

773
00:47:13,021 --> 00:47:18,021
people whose families have hated each
other's guts for generations who detest

774
00:47:18,121 --> 00:47:18,954
each other,

775
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:23,760
all agree that since the church is
now just a voluntary association,

776
00:47:23,761 --> 00:47:28,500
like any other, like the, like the, you
know, the podunk club, the boom club, uh,

777
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:32,000
or the food club soccer club,
uh,

778
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:37,170
that the only thing that arguably will
hold the village together is the identity

779
00:47:37,211 --> 00:47:41,080
that comes to this school,
the school of this particular village,

780
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:45,580
which is called Bazooka.
So just simply in conclusion,

781
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:50,590
you know, let's not exaggerate
this one national identity,

782
00:47:50,591 --> 00:47:54,600
nor assume that modernization has
come crashing along. Let us realize,

783
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:58,960
realize that complexity of
national and regional identities,

784
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:02,350
which can become intertwined,
which are intertwined,

785
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:07,830
and let us realize that these schools
have a remarkable role still in these

786
00:48:08,561 --> 00:48:09,640
communities.

787
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:13,960
It terribly important
at the most basic level,

788
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:18,250
and that remains in France
neighborhood and village.

789
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,320
See you on Wednesday.
