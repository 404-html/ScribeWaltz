WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.580
All right.
I want it to do,
they talk about 1968,
which I can even remember.

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.700
So I wasn't in France in 1968.
Um,

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.830
first of all,

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.480
1968 has to be put in the context of,

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.460
uh,
of a mobilization across western Europe.

6
00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:25.461
And indeed in some places in the United States that had more to do with,

7
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.530
um,
uh,
then simply a reform in universities.

8
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.060
But he had a lot to do with,

9
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.980
with the world as people like me saw in 1968,
uh,

10
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:41.400
it was a time when the Americans were,
uh,
were,
uh,

11
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:43.830
at war in Vietnam.

12
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:48.770
And the student protests had a begin begin to,
um,

13
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.240
I began to expand,
uh,
the first teaching against the war in Vietnam,

14
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:58.130
which was in the University of Michigan in Haven Hall,
uh,

15
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.490
and about 1966 or maybe 65 or 66.

16
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.150
Um,
and,
and,
and the movement spread a spread of the United States.

17
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.790
And,
and of course,
uh,
uh,

18
00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:16.750
you've read about a 1970 a Yale when people,
uh,
uh,

19
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.630
exams did never happen.
And it was a time of the Bobby Seale trial.

20
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.100
Uh,
and so it,
that sort of generation,

21
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:27.660
this our baby boom generation,

22
00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:32.400
whether it was in Rome or in Athens or in the Berlin or,
or,
uh,
Russell or,

23
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.210
or in a,
um,
you in Munich a well,
let's throw in Munich or,

24
00:01:37.211 --> 00:01:41.730
or in Madison,
Wisconsin or in,
uh,
Berkeley,

25
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:42.481
California,

26
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:47.100
where the free speech movement had started a couple years before that.

27
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.290
It was all sort of linked together as people thought about what had,

28
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.960
what the downsides of,
of,

29
00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:59.700
of the new prosperity that had come in France and other countries.

30
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.960
Uh,
and the expansion of the university system,
uh,
to,
uh,

31
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.070
to include more people.
Um,
and so,
uh,

32
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:12.720
this sort of waves of,
of,
of,
of,
of protest,
you know,
were linked.

33
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.540
And in the case of France,
if this is what we're talking about,
uh,

34
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.940
there were really two aspects of it.

35
00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:22.500
There were the strikes a more about that in a minute.
And then there were the,
uh,

36
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.910
were,
were the,
the,
the student demonstrations,
uh,

37
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:31.100
the riots,
uh,
the aggressive,
a reaction by a,

38
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.280
the so called forces of water,
which is what they liked to call themselves.
Um,

39
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.030
and,
uh,
leading eventually to the resignation of,
of,
um,
of,
uh,

40
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.470
of Charles de Gaulle.
So,
um,
it was at a time,

41
00:02:44.471 --> 00:02:47.640
I'd rather like 1936 when everything seemed possible,

42
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.930
and it was full of a time of,
of great optimism.

43
00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:53.070
And there all sorts of books published of,
uh,

44
00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:57.390
of the graffiti of 1968 a as students,
uh,

45
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.830
most of whom smoked in those days.
One and two,

46
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:04.630
the Odi all theater and unfortunately burned,
uh,
with their cigarettes.
Uh,
uh,

47
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:06.490
the beautiful chairs of the audio on theater.

48
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.660
And when speeches went on and on and the solve button,
uh,
uh,

49
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.160
the war of words was,
was written on the walls,
uh,
of,
uh,

50
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.850
uh,
of the subways as I guess I'm in a Garfunkel one sang,
but,
uh,
uh,
of,

51
00:03:19.851 --> 00:03:23.140
of the metal in Paris and on the walls of,
of the,

52
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.530
the [inaudible] a long live communication down with telecommunication,

53
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.270
you know,
reflected the,
uh,

54
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:36.271
the great uncertainty that technology and push button or remote controls.

55
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:40.270
And all of this was not enough in life.
Uh,
the more I make love,

56
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.380
the more I make the revolution.
Uh,
the more I make the revolution,

57
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.520
the more I make love every,
every view of things,

58
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:51.250
which is not strange.
His faults,

59
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.090
Amnesty and acts or which sovereigns forgive the injustices they have committed.

60
00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.930
That's not a bad one.

61
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.630
A mankind will not live free until the last capitalist has been hanged in the

62
00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:08.290
end.
Trails of the last bureaucrat,
not a very nice one.

63
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:12.360
That nor very original because that came from,
uh,
from,
uh,

64
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.460
the French revolution,
the radical phase of the French revolution,

65
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:19.630
that we will all be safe only even the last priest has been hung in the end

66
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:24.631
trails are strangled in the end trails of the last noble.

67
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.560
And so there was,
there was,
you know,
as they quarreled and they debated and they,

68
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.890
uh,
you know,
they battled a,
you know,

69
00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:36.910
everybody didn't agree on everything and it was like the Paris commune.
Uh,
uh,

70
00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:40.810
and there were a lot of childish aspects to it.
It was a,

71
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.840
it was a youthful resonance,
uh,
people my age,
so they're,

72
00:04:45.841 --> 00:04:50.260
most of them are older than me,
uh,
that,
uh,
you know,
in those days,

73
00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:54.610
professors you are old was one.
Uh,
and when I can remember,

74
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.930
and I believed it,
uh,
at the time,
never trust anybody over 30.

75
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.270
Uh,
I,
I,
you know,
30 seems awfully young to me now.

76
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.850
Um,
it was in the wake of,
of the consumer revolution.

77
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:14.530
It was in the wake of the 30 glorious years of the French economy expanding.

78
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:19.270
And the same thing happened.
They west German economic miracle as well.
It was,

79
00:05:19.271 --> 00:05:24.040
um,
a reaction to the kind of technocratic society,
uh,

80
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:28.390
that seemed unfulfilling,
that seemed to have turned capitalism in the state,

81
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:33.190
that dynamic duo loose on ordinary people.
And here it is,

82
00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:38.140
tell it was tied to the war in Vietnam and,
and,
and,
uh,
uh,
you know,
uh,

83
00:05:38.141 --> 00:05:42.040
uh,
verbally rhetorically violent reaction against,
uh,

84
00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:44.780
against American,
uh,
uh,

85
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.520
American way of sort of splitting up the world with,
with the,

86
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:52.960
with the Soviet Union.
And it has to be seen them in all of that.

87
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.160
And in it generated resistance.
I mean,
at the end,
uh,
you know,
uh,

88
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.540
we'll come into this in a while,
but there was a huge,

89
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:04.130
a huge march down the Sean's for these a and the of the,
of the,
the,
the,

90
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:08.600
the prosperous people.
And you could see them from the 16th or on the small,

91
00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:12.530
and there were ladies in their fur coats and they're flashing rings and they

92
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:17.360
were there to give their,
expressed their solidarity,
uh,
with the general,
uh,

93
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.720
to whom all of this seems something just strange from another planet that he

94
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:24.410
couldn't comprehend.
I didn't want to deal with,
uh,
uh,

95
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.970
just wished it was all going to go away.
Um,

96
00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.670
in,
in,
in terms of,
I mean,
also you have to put it,
you know,
you know,

97
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:36.940
it is linked to America's,
you have to remember an end.

98
00:06:36.941 --> 00:06:40.700
You weren't even born then.
One of you was in this room and the iPad besides me,

99
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.850
uh,
you know,
Martin Luther King had just been murdered in Memphis,
Tennessee and,

100
00:06:45.851 --> 00:06:50.270
and,
and,
uh,
you know,
th th that was,
uh,
that was an enormous,
enormous event,

101
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.180
uh,
for,
you know,
for people of my generation.
And,
and it seemed that if you,

102
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.340
the harder you worked for social justice and,
you know,

103
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.740
people believed in,

104
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:05.741
in social justice and we believed in associations and organizations and the,

105
00:07:05.851 --> 00:07:08.480
and then when people went out and up down in Mississippi,
you know,

106
00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:12.150
to work in the civil rights,
uh,
March,
then they got murdered.
And,
and,
uh,

107
00:07:12.151 --> 00:07:15.360
I remember going with a couple of friends of mine from Jesuit high school and we

108
00:07:15.361 --> 00:07:19.550
join,
went out to north Portland and joined the Naacp.

109
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.960
And,
and you know,
we're,
we were 16 years old.
We could do.

110
00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:28.330
We just learned how to drive and,
and,
and if you believe in social justice and,

111
00:07:28.331 --> 00:07:32.040
and,
and,
and we weren't,
you know,
big Milton.
So certainly during the war we,

112
00:07:32.041 --> 00:07:35.600
you know,
we,
we were,
we all were,
are many of us were,
but,

113
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:39.440
but then every time he thinks to be,
you know,
you took a big step forward,

114
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.400
then it just seemed like we were confronted with,
with,
uh,
the,

115
00:07:42.401 --> 00:07:46.130
the Lyndon Johnson's and the,
and the,
and the Richard Nixon's of the world,

116
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.980
and with the [inaudible] and with the murder of Martha Martin Luther King.
And,

117
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.400
and so the,
these things did reflect a globalization,
uh,
it just,

118
00:07:55.401 --> 00:07:57.590
as the Algerian war,
one of the arguments that I made,

119
00:07:57.591 --> 00:07:59.690
which is Matt Connolly's argument is,

120
00:07:59.691 --> 00:08:02.740
is that the Algerian war afflicted the globalization of,
you know,

121
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.050
technology in newspapers and,
and,
uh,
the,

122
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.260
the rebels getting the newspapers on their side about French torture.
Well,

123
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:12.560
the globalization of,
of,
of,
of News,
uh,
you know,

124
00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:17.561
with the God live from Vietnam and all of this business method issue.

125
00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:20.190
So the,
the,
the murder of Martin Luther King and,

126
00:08:20.191 --> 00:08:24.750
and the Americans plunging more and more money and more and more bodies into,
uh,

127
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.750
into wars,
uh,

128
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.830
in other places had ramifications from [inaudible],

129
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.690
which I'll talk about in a minute,
which is the university to the West,

130
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.000
one of them,
to the west of Paris.
And the,
and the swab been,
uh,
which is,
uh,

131
00:08:39.001 --> 00:08:39.200
you know,

132
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.320
had been there for centuries and centuries and centuries since the medieval

133
00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:47.180
period in the Latin quarter.
So,
you know,
the problems seemed,

134
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:52.430
did generate simplistic answers that if you thought hard and you would on an

135
00:08:53.001 --> 00:08:55.680
work that you could abolish the excesses of capitalism,

136
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.970
you could abolish the excesses of the state and that there would be a more

137
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:03.140
reasonable world,
wouldn't it?
That the Lyndon Johnson's,
uh,

138
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:08.070
am I remember March 31st,
1968 announced he would not run for office.

139
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.610
And the Richard Nixon's that,
that,
you know,
people power,

140
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:15.750
that was a phrase that was used in France and the United States and Berkeley at

141
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:20.190
Columbia,
you know,
in Anarbor all sorts of places.
But specifically in France,

142
00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:23.580
it had to do with,
um,
a crisis of education,

143
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.200
a crisis in education,
uh,

144
00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.680
that education in a society that was still class based and to an extent is still

145
00:09:32.941 --> 00:09:33.990
class based.

146
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:39.410
I had remained the privilege of the upper classes even as the numbers of people.

147
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:42.510
Uh,
uh,

148
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:47.460
in the university system in France had increased dramatically as all,
uh,

149
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:52.080
all across Europe had this had happened.
Um,
in 1938,

150
00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:57.081
there were 79,000 university students in France in 1958,

151
00:09:57.391 --> 00:10:01.800
59,
there were 192,000 in the same buildings.

152
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.390
In 1968,
1967,
68,

153
00:10:06.391 --> 00:10:09.820
there were 478,000.
Uh,

154
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.050
that is a huge number.
And,
and,
uh,

155
00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:16.560
in 1968 just since 1967,

156
00:10:16.561 --> 00:10:21.561
the number had increased by 50,000 more in one year.

157
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:27.480
Now this is the baby boom.
I mean,
if you go back 18,

158
00:10:27.481 --> 00:10:31.050
20 years before that,
you have the know of the family again.
I mean,

159
00:10:31.051 --> 00:10:33.830
at the end of World War II.
So you've got all these,
these,
you know,

160
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.400
little babies who had grown up,
uh,
you know,
uh,
like me and you know,

161
00:10:38.401 --> 00:10:42.750
we're in,
we're in universities,
but the university structure,
uh,

162
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:47.460
could not possibly welcome all of these,
all of these folks.
Um,

163
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:51.140
you know,
I have these really good friends in Leon.

164
00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.370
It actually does not live in Paris and are they,

165
00:10:53.371 --> 00:10:57.500
I met a Greek professor long time ago and she was teaching a,
in one of these,

166
00:10:57.501 --> 00:11:02.501
a huge great university's in Athens where she had 1000 students in her class,

167
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.970
1000 and no tas,

168
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:11.640
you better come up with a question that you can grade 1000 answers to,

169
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.380
uh,
you know,
name three people,
uh,
name three,

170
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.100
19th century Greeks.
Uh,
you better come up with,
I mean,

171
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.300
it was an impossible situation for students and,
and,
and for a,
and for faculty.

172
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.380
And as now as in the issues now,
uh,

173
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:32.070
there wasn't light at the end of the tunnel because compounding the fact that

174
00:11:32.071 --> 00:11:34.560
there weren't jobs unless you were in one of the grounds they caught,

175
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.810
that is the big fancy schools.

176
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.410
Unless you were in now one of these people in the administration school who was

177
00:11:40.411 --> 00:11:45.030
going to just slide into some party post in a godless government,

178
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.300
uh,
and what was there at the end.
And you also had this,

179
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.360
this extraordinary ambiguity,
uh,
you know,

180
00:11:51.361 --> 00:11:54.550
in thinking about there's their ambivalence because if you were basically

181
00:11:54.551 --> 00:11:58.600
against the sort of technological super powered society of,
of,
of,

182
00:11:58.601 --> 00:12:02.950
of fast cars,
uh,
and,
uh,
the Americanization of,

183
00:12:02.951 --> 00:12:07.090
of a European culture,
if you believe strongly against that,
you know,

184
00:12:07.091 --> 00:12:09.010
what kind of job is there going to be at the end of the tunnel for you?

185
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.890
You can't be a professional militant,
you know,
your entire life.

186
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:15.010
What are you going to do?
And the people,
by the way,
who were,

187
00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:19.690
who invested their careers or lost their careers in this mobilization,

188
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:24.560
uh,
we're toast because they refuse to sit for their exams.
Uh,

189
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.360
and they committed professional suicide right on stage cause they did it.

190
00:12:28.361 --> 00:12:31.420
And it all starts with a lot of it.
When Daniel,
Danielle,
Danielle,
the cone bendy,

191
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:36.040
who was a militant when he was expelled from the University of,
of [inaudible],

192
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:41.200
uh,
uh,
because of,
of,
of his militancy.
So there was a lack of jobs,

193
00:12:41.201 --> 00:12:45.940
particularly for those people studying the life of the mind,
uh,
studying,

194
00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:50.560
uh,
art,
literature,
history,
uh,

195
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.610
and the structure had changed very little since Napoleon home bragged that when

196
00:12:54.611 --> 00:12:58.890
he created,
you know,
the academy,
that he knew what everybody was studying at any,

197
00:12:58.891 --> 00:13:02.380
any given time,
it had not changed.
And to some extent,
it still hasn't changed.

198
00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:05.050
Now,
a more about that,
maybe in a minute.

199
00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:10.051
The structures of the universities were extremely rigid in 1964.

200
00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.490
Um,

201
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:17.490
2% of this university students were sons or daughters of workers and peasants.

202
00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:23.260
2% in 1964.

203
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.990
This is what's called a class society.

204
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:30.770
And it had not changed very much by 1968.
Um,

205
00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.300
and people blame the state for the rigidity.
I have a friend in effect,

206
00:13:34.301 --> 00:13:39.100
the Gaullist with whom I waited in line to get into noto dom for the,
uh,
uh,

207
00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:43.060
the Charles de Gaulle affair,
uh,
who I was supposed to take a,

208
00:13:43.061 --> 00:13:45.890
he's a lawyer and he was taking an advanced degree and he,
uh,

209
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:50.200
he lived in the suburbs and he stayed in a prosperous suburb,
fairly prosperous,

210
00:13:50.201 --> 00:13:54.550
but he stayed in Paris one night because the metro is closed and buses closed,

211
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.450
you know,
as if you didn't make the 1232,
then,
you know,
you had a long walk.

212
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.140
And I walked back to that suburban hitchhiked back and all of that,

213
00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:06.010
some funny stories about that,
but not at the time.
Uh,
and he got,

214
00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:10.030
he got back on a,
on Saturday to find,
uh,
a Matisse,

215
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:14.230
which was a way of communicating these little things that shot around and then

216
00:14:14.231 --> 00:14:17.320
were delivered to your in tubes and they're delivered your house saying that he

217
00:14:17.321 --> 00:14:20.650
was supposed to show up for the examiner to arrive on Friday when he was at work

218
00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:22.510
and was supposed to take his exam on Saturday.

219
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:27.130
And of course he got it on Saturday at about noon when he got home after as long

220
00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:30.250
night in Paris.
And that was the end of that,
you know,
then you just simply say,

221
00:14:30.251 --> 00:14:33.280
well,
you know,
I guess I'll take it next time around if I happen to be here.

222
00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:37.380
It was a rigid system,
uh,
that was unforgiving and,

223
00:14:37.381 --> 00:14:42.381
and seem to seem to be perpetuating the kind of elite Ism and the kind of unfair

224
00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:49.060
in a sociopolitical world,
uh,
against which,
uh,
people,
uh,

225
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.050
people struggled.

226
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:54.700
And a 1967 and the worst economic year of the sixties says,

227
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:58.100
I just said,
you know,
the Gauls response was typically said,
well,

228
00:14:58.101 --> 00:15:00.730
we need to have more participation.
Kiss Cassava,
Dia,

229
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.250
what does this mean to have more participation?
You know,

230
00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:08.210
what do you mean by that?
Well,
he meant nothing by that.
Uh,
he,
uh,
um,

231
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:12.470
you know,
in October,
1966,
his workers were,
we're getting increasingly Milton.

232
00:15:12.471 --> 00:15:13.700
He said,
you know,

233
00:15:13.701 --> 00:15:17.520
that the changes that we must bring to the working class condition as the active

234
00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:22.320
association of work and the Active Association of the economy,
uh,

235
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:26.930
which we are all want to,
uh,
uh,
we want to accomplish all of us.

236
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.590
What does this mean?
It means nothing.
It means nothing.

237
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:35.870
And so phrases like that census like that are reassuring for,

238
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:36.560
you know,

239
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.550
for the upper classes in Paris who were Leo and the sixth are on these more of

240
00:15:40.551 --> 00:15:43.670
the arm or wherever,
who don't want to be Bruce Good Aa.

241
00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.090
They don't want to be bothered by,
uh,
they,

242
00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:49.190
they don't want to be bothered by the militancy of,
of,
of,
uh,

243
00:15:49.191 --> 00:15:52.130
students and of workers.
They want the Metros to run.

244
00:15:52.131 --> 00:15:53.950
They want the buses to run a,

245
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.480
they don't want the students building barricades and all of this stuff.

246
00:15:56.481 --> 00:15:59.390
So it's reassuring to them,
but it didn't mean anything.
Uh,

247
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.810
and what the goal was so completely out of it.
He said,
it's just to be Coop Bay.

248
00:16:02.811 --> 00:16:06.110
They fall,
say,
you know,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm a drift from the French.

249
00:16:06.111 --> 00:16:09.300
I'm cut off from the French,
you know,
uh,
because he,
he,
he,
uh,

250
00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:12.850
he had no understanding it for,
for that the,
that,

251
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.160
the nationalism of French should be enough that the mystical body of himself

252
00:16:16.161 --> 00:16:18.800
should certainly be enough.
But of course it wasn't.

253
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.180
And the demonstrations that many of them organized by the National Union of

254
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:27.920
Students,
um,
which had be done,
uh,
you know,
which was militant.

255
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:32.160
I had began in the 1950s,
or maybe the forties.
I don't,
I don't remember,
uh,

256
00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.730
is Milton's,
he had declined after the Algerian war,
but then I,
it,
uh,

257
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.990
um,
you had this,
you have,
uh,
the student leaders,

258
00:16:41.991 --> 00:16:44.890
I mean,
whose names you don't remember,
but,
uh,
they were young,

259
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:49.070
often young sociologists or one was in physics,
allows us with the names,

260
00:16:49.071 --> 00:16:51.560
don't matter what they did to them.
And they did the people in my generation,

261
00:16:51.561 --> 00:16:55.010
but they don't necessarily do you,
um,
they,
uh,
you know,

262
00:16:55.011 --> 00:16:59.850
they were in sociology or an or it mostly in the,
in literature and history and,

263
00:16:59.851 --> 00:17:04.850
and they all committed together,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
professional,

264
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.030
uh,
suicide.
And so it begins with demonstrations and knocked out.

265
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:13.550
Now the French university system,
uh,
began with,
uh,
uh,

266
00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:15.540
you know,
it began with a saw been,
um,

267
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:18.200
and the Latin quarter is so-called as you know,

268
00:17:18.201 --> 00:17:21.980
because that's what people spoke in the Middle Ages.
Students conversed in Latin,

269
00:17:21.981 --> 00:17:25.250
Latin was a living language.
Um,
and the first medical school,

270
00:17:25.251 --> 00:17:28.970
Second Medical School in Europe,
his moped,
Yay.
The first was Polonia.
Uh,

271
00:17:28.971 --> 00:17:33.690
and there was already a very strong university in Leon.
Uh,
and uh,
there,

272
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.560
there are the act,
there was axe and there were other universities,
but the,

273
00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:40.190
the big expansion of even the para system,
uh,
and of,

274
00:17:40.191 --> 00:17:45.191
of provincial universities has come in response in part to a,

275
00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.440
these big events,
uh,
in this heady time,

276
00:17:48.441 --> 00:17:50.980
but they haven't necessarily brought,
uh,

277
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:55.110
brought many changes is as we'll see,
um,
uh,
see later.

278
00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:59.670
And so I know that there's also a lack of a campus.
I mean,
if he was going,

279
00:17:59.671 --> 00:18:04.620
I've taught in Leon and Leon do,
and I teach in a wall sometimes,
um,

280
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.940
and theirs,
with the exception of [inaudible],
which has a fairly nice campus,

281
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.920
um,
maybe we won't put the a little bit,
uh,
most of these places,
uh,
you know,

282
00:18:13.921 --> 00:18:18.330
students don't,
most of them don't,
don't live in dormitories.
Uh,

283
00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:20.370
and so they're just places where they go.

284
00:18:20.371 --> 00:18:22.380
They're essentially all commuter colleges.
If you,

285
00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:25.530
if you go to [inaudible] University of was,
you know,
one,
two or three,

286
00:18:25.531 --> 00:18:28.560
there are also named in such a,
uh,
uh,
not terribly poetic way.

287
00:18:28.561 --> 00:18:32.970
University of Paris is one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven,
eight,
nine,
10,
11,
12,
13,

288
00:18:32.971 --> 00:18:36.530
14.
So you say,
where,
where are you a student when let's just be a bout,

289
00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.660
he reads once just to be a body.
Got To us.
Good luck if you're a pal.

290
00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:44.180
He got tossed a,
that's a really tough news.
And Oh my God,
uh,

291
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:48.000
it's just unbelievable.
These are buildings that were built already,

292
00:18:48.001 --> 00:18:52.230
falling apart and are just out there and there's solace and,
and,
and,
uh,
it's,
uh,

293
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.420
you know,
you're privileged.
Uh,

294
00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:57.630
you've worked very hard to be privileged and Michigan,
we were privileged,

295
00:18:57.631 --> 00:19:01.680
but you can't,
there's no sense of solidarity.
There's nothing to do.

296
00:19:01.681 --> 00:19:05.070
There's no s sports really.
Basically there's equivalent of club sports.

297
00:19:05.071 --> 00:19:08.330
There's just,
they would just sit around and smoke cigarettes and,
and,
uh,

298
00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.090
there's just not much to do.
There's no,
there's no sense of esprit de Corps.

299
00:19:12.091 --> 00:19:15.870
There's no sense of being in a former student of that place.
It's just you,

300
00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:18.700
it's part of your existence for three years,
uh,

301
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.770
unless you're one of the grounds they call or the fancy folks and all that.
And,

302
00:19:22.771 --> 00:19:23.250
um,

303
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:28.250
so even trying to get people to mobilize against the structure is in very easy,

304
00:19:28.771 --> 00:19:32.040
but,
but the conditions,
they started out with these demonstrations against these,

305
00:19:32.041 --> 00:19:36.340
uh,
uh,
against these conditions.
This is also tied,
and this is the point I,

306
00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:40.140
I for,
for a stupidly forgot to mention earlier that,
you know,

307
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:44.760
the women's movement,
uh,
the,
although not terribly,
um,
uh,

308
00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:47.150
uh,
dominant in France,
I mean,

309
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:52.110
it's still essentially a limited,
uh,
and this is probably an exaggeration,

310
00:19:52.111 --> 00:19:55.800
but,
but to,
to the middle class feminists,
uh,
uh,

311
00:19:55.801 --> 00:19:59.580
influenced by Simone de Beauvoir,
uh,
the women's movement also meant that,

312
00:19:59.581 --> 00:20:03.210
that lots of women who were put four for their claims.
And again,
as I said,

313
00:20:03.211 --> 00:20:06.360
that the vast majority of the students are,
are bourgeois students.
I mean,

314
00:20:06.361 --> 00:20:10.110
they're upperclass students.
And so,
but,
but that,
that still was part of it.

315
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:14.370
And the way society is structured in United States,
then we're,
we're,
uh,
you know,

316
00:20:14.371 --> 00:20:18.690
sexism was,
was even more endemic than,
than,
than it is that it is now,
uh,

317
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.640
that this,
this for,
for,
for Milliken,

318
00:20:20.641 --> 00:20:23.910
females said this was part of the problem too.
I mean,
there's,
there was so much,

319
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.900
uh,
that seem to be having to be changed,
that it was very,
very frustrating.

320
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.230
And so,
uh,
there are occupations,

321
00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:35.340
people in United States occupied administrative buildings.
Uh,

322
00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.920
and fortunately they did often destroyed books.
Uh,

323
00:20:37.921 --> 00:20:41.340
it happened to Columbia and places like that.
Uh,

324
00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:44.550
but there was lots of student occupations,
you know,
Yale,
there were two,
I mean,

325
00:20:44.551 --> 00:20:47.350
I wasn't around a bit,
but there were two in the national guard,

326
00:20:47.351 --> 00:20:50.770
if you can imagine the,
the national guard tanks coming up.

327
00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:54.400
John Blum has told me about that.
My form,
my colleague,
former colleague,

328
00:20:54.401 --> 00:20:58.250
now long retired,
but he,
uh,
you know,
uh,
Branford College was Luca Ledger,

329
00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.900
who's Ya?
Uh,
and the,
um,
the,
you know,

330
00:21:01.901 --> 00:21:04.750
I guess it had a red flag up or something and tanks were coming down.

331
00:21:04.751 --> 00:21:08.500
If you could imagine tanks coming down or up York street,
between,
uh,

332
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:13.340
between JDE and Pearson there,
between Davenport and,
and Branford and,

333
00:21:13.341 --> 00:21:14.081
and,
and,
you know,

334
00:21:14.081 --> 00:21:18.580
they were setting up little welcome centers and possible places to treat people

335
00:21:18.581 --> 00:21:21.970
that are injured by the national guard who wanted nothing above of militant

336
00:21:21.971 --> 00:21:25.510
privileged students,
you know,
in the night.
And May 4th,
1970,

337
00:21:25.511 --> 00:21:29.110
done them down at Ken State with great pleasure.
Uh,
you know,
the,

338
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:32.420
these were different times,
but anyway,
so in France,
they started occupying up,
uh,

339
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:36.820
uh,
buildings.
And on May,
uh,
this Arbonne has closed down,
uh,
on,

340
00:21:36.821 --> 00:21:41.230
on May set,
on May 2nd,
I,
and on May 3rd,
the police,
uh,

341
00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:46.030
the police move in and now the police,
uh,
the crs,

342
00:21:46.031 --> 00:21:49.750
we're hated.
We're hated the crs,
crs.
Uh,

343
00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.510
many of them were southerners and rumors.

344
00:21:52.511 --> 00:21:56.210
And I can remember these rumors that they were,
you know,
kept in their,
uh,
uh,

345
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.680
kept in their barracks and not fed enough.
And,
and,
and,
uh,

346
00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:04.810
given special sections on why,
you know,
why Milton workers and Milton students,

347
00:22:04.811 --> 00:22:08.440
a representative,
the end of civilization as they had known it and,
you know,

348
00:22:08.441 --> 00:22:10.750
they had their big,
you can still see this now cause they have,

349
00:22:10.751 --> 00:22:13.810
they've made them feel they have free reign.
I Will Sarcozi uh,
you know,

350
00:22:13.811 --> 00:22:17.700
there are big shields and their big helmets and what you call in French,

351
00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.070
you know,
penny a salad,
these,
these,
uh,
big trucks that,

352
00:22:21.071 --> 00:22:25.850
that have grills on them,
you know,
and,
and like if you're shaking lettuce and,

353
00:22:25.851 --> 00:22:26.770
and,
you know,

354
00:22:26.771 --> 00:22:30.100
they would suddenly come Taryn along the place and it wasn't just circulate,

355
00:22:30.101 --> 00:22:32.800
like move along,
move along,
and they just beat the hell out of you.

356
00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:35.590
And there's still more,
still not sure how many people died in all of this,

357
00:22:35.591 --> 00:22:38.470
how many people were battered by these folks.
But you can tell,
I mean,

358
00:22:38.471 --> 00:22:42.640
I grew up just hating these people,
just hating them.
You know,
you'd walk along a,

359
00:22:42.641 --> 00:22:43.990
you know,
in the 70s even,
you know,

360
00:22:43.991 --> 00:22:48.300
they'd be down in their trucks and blue are central man,
you know,
or,
uh,
your,

361
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.320
there'd be clustered around the Otis of the v.
Let me,

362
00:22:50.321 --> 00:22:53.140
there's still a very contentious agent.
You just grew up,
you know,

363
00:22:53.141 --> 00:22:55.780
if you're my generation,
I guess my politics,
uh,
you just,

364
00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:59.530
you just just hated these people and nobody hated them ahead had reasoned more

365
00:22:59.531 --> 00:23:02.950
to hate them.
And this may be unfair,
but,
but it's not an unfair,
uh,

366
00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:07.210
than minorities,
uh,
because those are the ones that,
that,
that these white,
uh,

367
00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:10.510
many of them,
of course it can,
but it's not just Corsicans,
but,
uh,
uh,

368
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:14.900
white people from the south who were moved into northern posts and,
and,
and,
uh,

369
00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:15.700
they,
they want,

370
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.860
didn't want to see North Africans or west Africans and folks like that around.

371
00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:22.780
But anyway,
they move in.
Um,
they vacuum with this,
our bond and,
uh,

372
00:23:22.781 --> 00:23:24.490
things get spin out of control.

373
00:23:24.491 --> 00:23:28.990
And the May 10th to May 11th or the is the night of the barricades and the

374
00:23:28.991 --> 00:23:33.991
barricades go up in streets that had not had to Oakmont is boulevards plowed

375
00:23:34.181 --> 00:23:37.420
through them.
It was harder.
They,
where they do make some attempts than they do.

376
00:23:37.421 --> 00:23:39.130
I guess if I remember right across the,

377
00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.680
that that was the only year I wasn't there.
I said,
odd,
isn't it?
But,
uh,

378
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:44.320
as I first started going to France when I was a kid,

379
00:23:44.321 --> 00:23:47.270
1967 and I'd been there at least four months every year since then,

380
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:52.580
and I wasn't there in 1968.
Uh,
but there were barricades built,
uh,

381
00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.720
uh,
between Woolworth's,
Sandra,
who,
Sanjay Rock in the boulevard,
San Michelle,

382
00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.470
you know,
in that sort of now touristy overrun with Mcdonald's quarter.
Uh,

383
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:05.150
there are tourist corridor and all around the room is still a price and all

384
00:24:05.151 --> 00:24:09.170
around the ODL.
And,
uh,
the,
the barricades were built,
unfortunately,

385
00:24:09.171 --> 00:24:12.410
many of them with trees that were,
that were ripped down on the,
on the,

386
00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.650
on the boulevard side,
San Michelle,
they did a lot of damage there.

387
00:24:15.651 --> 00:24:19.310
And they ripped up cobblestones.
Were streets,
still had cobblestones.
And they,

388
00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:24.050
you know,
do shovel where these little,
uh,
a little,
very unsafe,

389
00:24:24.051 --> 00:24:25.730
flimsy cars that you could,
I mean,

390
00:24:25.731 --> 00:24:29.330
I wear this friend of mine picked up the front of a Douche,
a vote to move,

391
00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.970
you know,
to park.
You can just pick,
literally,
you know,

392
00:24:31.971 --> 00:24:34.520
this guy that you can pick it up and kind of move the front along.

393
00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:39.400
And these things were easily transformed into barricades and,
and,
uh,
uh,

394
00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:42.380
this was the night of the barricades and there was a lot of violence.
I mean,

395
00:24:42.381 --> 00:24:45.730
these were real barricades.
And,
um,
and this was,
um,

396
00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.130
a want rather one sided violence,
but still a,

397
00:24:49.131 --> 00:24:53.750
so there are 367 wounded,
several killed.
We still don't know how many,

398
00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:58.160
uh,
and about 460 arrests.
Um,

399
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:03.710
before that,
even on May 6th,
during the fighting,
they were 1,422 arrests,

400
00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:08.870
uh,
a et Cetera,
et cetera.
And the middleclass would,
was,
you know,

401
00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.200
was shocked by the,
you know,
by the brutality of the fighting.

402
00:25:12.201 --> 00:25:16.190
But they were more shocked by the fact that,
that you had workers and,
and,
and,

403
00:25:16.191 --> 00:25:20.960
and students,
uh,
uh,
who had not yet really coalesced,
uh,
that were,

404
00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.780
uh,
defying the state.
And one of the obvious,
uh,
say,
uh,

405
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:28.690
s s s say,
uh,
say ais,

406
00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.880
s s you know,
that as the SS,
as in the,
you know,

407
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.700
Hitler's a organization and,
and,
uh,
this is what a w w was,
uh,

408
00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:41.150
uh,
chanted and,
uh,
um,
it was,
um,

409
00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.990
uh,
you know,
uh,
all the way up to the jar,
Dah,
Dah,
Luke,

410
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:50.540
some more from which they could get materials also for,
uh,
these barricades.

411
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:55.520
Um,
how,
how did the government react?
The,
the,
the prime minister was,

412
00:25:55.521 --> 00:25:58.360
so Georgia pump,
you do,
um,
you know,

413
00:25:58.361 --> 00:26:02.900
a pure kind of gall us to who,
uh,
whose only resistance in World War II.

414
00:26:02.901 --> 00:26:05.030
Incidentally,
this is a bit mean to say,
but he wants,

415
00:26:05.031 --> 00:26:08.900
refused to sit next to a gestapo officer at a I in the opera,

416
00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:11.540
in a Lowe's at the opera,
but plumpy do a,

417
00:26:11.541 --> 00:26:15.770
had been in Afghanistan and he came back,
uh,
on,
uh,
May 11th and,

418
00:26:15.771 --> 00:26:20.250
and orders the university reopening without the police.
Um,

419
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:25.340
and then he went off to Romania as planned,
and then he came back and found,

420
00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:30.550
uh,
that,
um,
that that strikes had,
um,
uh,

421
00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.580
that,
that,
that strikes had a,
uh,
had spread.

422
00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:39.790
Now the strikes themselves,
uh,
you know,
we're,
uh,
both to separate but,

423
00:26:39.791 --> 00:26:44.690
but related movement and the strikes came in the large and the reno plants in,

424
00:26:44.691 --> 00:26:46.720
in,
uh,
[inaudible],
uh,

425
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:52.080
the same kinds of occupations that had happened in 19,
uh,
36,

426
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:57.360
uh,
in a way rather festival op,
uh,
uh,
festive occupations,

427
00:26:57.361 --> 00:27:02.130
uh,
as Lenin Lennon.
One said with considerable reason about,
uh,
uh,
the commune,

428
00:27:02.131 --> 00:27:04.910
he'd called it a festival of the oppressed and,
and,
and there was a,
you know,

429
00:27:04.911 --> 00:27:08.520
a good humor in these occupations.
Again,
the same kind of guerrilla theater and,

430
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:12.660
and all of this great attention not to destroy the machinery that the workers,

431
00:27:12.661 --> 00:27:17.280
when this all would settled,
uh,
would,
uh,
uh,
w w would come back.

432
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:22.020
Um,
but,
um,
uh,
on May 14th,
um,

433
00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:24.870
uh,
and May 14th,

434
00:27:24.871 --> 00:27:27.780
they're an aircraft plant near north was occupied.

435
00:27:27.781 --> 00:27:31.560
And then the sit downs PR a strike spread as in 1936,

436
00:27:31.561 --> 00:27:36.450
I May 16th workers occupy the gigantic Reno belong cool.
Uh,
uh,

437
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.030
who an old plant,
uh,
uh,
there.

438
00:27:39.031 --> 00:27:43.320
And then it spread to two other ideas.
It was the largest,
I mean,

439
00:27:43.321 --> 00:27:48.120
to other areas.
It was the largest mobilization of workers in French history.
Um,

440
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:53.040
without any question.
Even more than 19,
uh,
36 and rather like 1936,

441
00:27:53.041 --> 00:27:57.060
it left the communist party confused and uncertain because once again,

442
00:27:57.061 --> 00:27:59.910
it seemed to be that the tail was wagging the dog.
You know,

443
00:27:59.911 --> 00:28:03.540
workers are striking on their own and they had slogans that weren't really big

444
00:28:03.541 --> 00:28:05.960
communist slogans.
One was auteurs yes,

445
00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:08.940
y'all that is workers self management.

446
00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:13.110
The workers would run their own factories.
Now in the Soviet Union,
uh,

447
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.640
after the Russian revolution,

448
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:19.500
the Bolshevik and the communist party had crushed like grapes workers who

449
00:28:19.501 --> 00:28:23.220
attempted to run their own factories and who wanted to have strikes and,
and,
and,

450
00:28:23.221 --> 00:28:27.660
and working the power of the proletariat,
uh,
in,
in the Soviet Union of,

451
00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:28.680
of to an extent of Lenin.

452
00:28:28.681 --> 00:28:32.880
But above all the stolen became the dictatorship of the communist party.
Uh,

453
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.350
work herself.
Management,
uh,
had,
was simply didn't exist.

454
00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:40.620
It was run by the party,
uh,
in,
in,
in,

455
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:44.910
in theory it existed and the Communist Party was supposed to represent the

456
00:28:44.911 --> 00:28:47.620
Russian and the Soviet working class.
But in fact,
you know,

457
00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.150
the Communist Party had his existence of its own.
I,

458
00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.160
and so suddenly they're confused cause here's our workers saying we want to run

459
00:28:53.161 --> 00:28:56.340
the,
you know,
we,
we want to squat and strike now and said,
well wait and wait.

460
00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:59.520
It was the same thing as I think there are six,
everything is not possible.

461
00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:03.360
Everything is not possible.
Uh,
but for workers occupying their plants,

462
00:29:03.361 --> 00:29:06.600
it seem to be,
this seem to be the moment that a w to do it.

463
00:29:06.601 --> 00:29:10.290
And there's a strong link between big strike movements and political opportunity

464
00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:15.450
as in 1936.
So it's a very,
very good comparison to make.
Taunt sees as six 30,

465
00:29:15.451 --> 00:29:18.720
six and a 60 and 68.

466
00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:22.550
And the workers want to participation in industrial decision making.

467
00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.740
They want to control over the pace of work.
Again,

468
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.290
they were against Taylorism that they're being measured,

469
00:29:28.291 --> 00:29:31.980
their performance that's being measured by the number of units of whatever car

470
00:29:31.981 --> 00:29:35.730
handles,
whatever they're making a that they do,
they want to have the right,

471
00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:39.690
which they eventually wanted to have a union office in the factory and to

472
00:29:39.691 --> 00:29:43.960
collect,
to collect fees from workers for the Union and,

473
00:29:43.961 --> 00:29:47.100
and make collect,
get,
collect.
So,
you know,
uh,
uh,

474
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:50.470
the pass the hat and union,
uh,

475
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:55.270
on behalf of the Union and on behalf of workers in the Union at,
uh,
uh,

476
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.570
during,
um,
uh,
at work.

477
00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:03.130
And so the political goals can't really be separated from the workers movement

478
00:30:03.131 --> 00:30:07.880
was all part of this,
this huge,
uh,
uh,
mobilization and workers and,
and,

479
00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:11.260
and students had,
had really had a lot more in common and they're,
they,
uh,

480
00:30:11.261 --> 00:30:12.970
then they didn't the United States,
cause I mean,

481
00:30:12.971 --> 00:30:15.730
people of my generation can remember,
uh,
you know,

482
00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:19.330
students at University of Michigan going down to the Ford plants in Ypsilanti,

483
00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:24.470
uh,
at and other places and up in Flint.
And,
and,
uh,
the,

484
00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.570
the workers there,
they didn't want it to hear anything about,

485
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:30.310
about these privileged white students opposing the war in Vietnam.

486
00:30:30.311 --> 00:30:34.560
They wanted to,
you know,
have a boat and go out and Lake Michigan,
Lake Huron,
uh,

487
00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:37.040
and they,
and they,
they were,
you know,
the wolf,

488
00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:39.190
the United States government is fighting a war in Vietnam.

489
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:42.030
And I must be United States government knows what it's doing.
A,

490
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:43.150
and they didn't want any part of it.

491
00:30:43.151 --> 00:30:47.760
And so it was a total of talk about a failure to,
to,
uh,
to comprehend a,
it,

492
00:30:47.761 --> 00:30:52.450
it just,
it,
it,
it,
it,
it did,
it didn't work.
And to an extent,

493
00:30:52.451 --> 00:30:55.990
this isn't probably not a fair comparison,
but it would rather be be like,
uh,

494
00:30:56.190 --> 00:31:00.920
you know,
Milson and Columbia and Yale and Harvard and Michigan and w Madison,
uh,

495
00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:01.850
activists,

496
00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:07.120
some white and some black going down to Alabama and Mississippi.
Uh,
and,

497
00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:10.270
and trying to talk to people down there because it just,
it didn't work.

498
00:31:10.271 --> 00:31:14.860
But in France,
uh,
because the,
the state structure seem to be,
uh,

499
00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:18.130
in a very centralized structure,
not a federalized structure,

500
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:21.220
so you could find time common cause,
uh,

501
00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:25.770
because you're the factory worker who was occupying a factory,
his enemies,

502
00:31:25.771 --> 00:31:28.670
the crs,
uh,
and the students,
uh,

503
00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.940
who are afraid they're going to get gunned down by it,
by the crs.
Uh,
they,

504
00:31:32.941 --> 00:31:34.680
they have things that they're,
um,

505
00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:39.690
they had in common and they were both fighting against the brutality that

506
00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:43.900
brutalization as they would have put it of human relations is that capitalism

507
00:31:43.901 --> 00:31:44.970
seem to be,
uh,

508
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:48.820
simply perpetuating this favored society in which the rich do very,
very well.

509
00:31:48.821 --> 00:31:50.460
Thank you very much.
And the grounds,

510
00:31:50.461 --> 00:31:53.620
they call our full of only people who are well connected.
Basically.

511
00:31:53.621 --> 00:31:54.760
That was always the case,

512
00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:59.440
the big fancy schools and the brutalization of human relations on the shop floor

513
00:31:59.441 --> 00:32:03.910
with,
uh,
you know,
the bosses are dictating the rhythm of work.
So it seemed to be,

514
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:07.150
you know,
there seems to be this sort of moment where,
where some,
you know,

515
00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:12.160
progress,
um,
uh,
uh,
uh,
could be made.
Um,

516
00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.490
and then the sense that you're powerless within the system and the French

517
00:32:15.491 --> 00:32:18.580
educational system you were in to an extent still are powerless.

518
00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:22.080
And in the factory you were powerless.
And eight,

519
00:32:22.081 --> 00:32:24.740
you're probably arguably more powerless,
not because the role of the unions has,

520
00:32:24.741 --> 00:32:27.800
has declined,
uh,
uh,
in the United States,
I mean,

521
00:32:27.801 --> 00:32:32.440
in France as a United States.
And in the end,
um,
uh,
you know,

522
00:32:32.441 --> 00:32:36.490
the government had to pass laws,
uh,
giving,
uh,
legal,
uh,
status,
uh,

523
00:32:36.491 --> 00:32:40.670
within each factory to the union that they could,
could collect funds.
Uh,

524
00:32:40.671 --> 00:32:45.660
as I said,
I guess I already said that,
and,
uh,
could,
uh,
could had an office,
uh,

525
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:48.920
there,
uh,
but the education reforms,
uh,

526
00:32:48.921 --> 00:32:53.810
basically a scratch the surface,
the,
the,
the,
uh,
beginning,

527
00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:58.430
uh,
creating new,
uh,
a new universities.
Uh,

528
00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.530
uh,
all,
all over the places.

529
00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:04.280
And now there's only a couple of day pop them all in France that don't have at

530
00:33:04.281 --> 00:33:07.850
least branches of universities.
The most recently created real our shell,

531
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:12.980
which is going very nicely and to [inaudible] in a Haas.
Uh,

532
00:33:12.981 --> 00:33:16.790
but even these,
the,
even the,
these lead to problems because of,
for example,

533
00:33:16.791 --> 00:33:20.100
when they create a university in La Rochelle,
uh,
then you're particularly,
you,

534
00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:24.110
you are hurting an old established university Poitier,
you know,

535
00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:28.130
which becomes a sort of instant rival La Rochelle does for students from the

536
00:33:28.131 --> 00:33:32.720
area around La Rochelle and the Patek La,
uh,
that is up,
you know,
in a Haas,

537
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:37.810
uh,
uh,
you know,
what does that hurt?
Well,
that that is resisted by Leela,

538
00:33:37.811 --> 00:33:42.290
obviously in leader three universities in the leads,
a big student center.
Um,

539
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.920
so,
uh,
even in places that are major university towns,

540
00:33:45.921 --> 00:33:47.870
and to lose a is a good example.
I mean,

541
00:33:47.871 --> 00:33:51.470
they create more universities or they expand the University of,
of Toulouse.

542
00:33:51.471 --> 00:33:53.930
I mean more branches and stuff like that.
And,
and,
and,
uh,

543
00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:57.470
but does this solve the problem?
It really doesn't because,
um,

544
00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.760
because French universities remain woefully underfunded.

545
00:34:01.761 --> 00:34:06.170
And that's why this issue of this law that's been proposed in the past,

546
00:34:06.171 --> 00:34:10.610
I guess the law,
the pet krass law,
Pec,
r,
e,
s,
s,
e,

547
00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:15.320
which is to make these budgets autonomous of universities represents the kind of

548
00:34:15.321 --> 00:34:20.230
an Americanization of the French,
a system where,
uh,
uh,
the,
the,

549
00:34:20.231 --> 00:34:22.220
the favored will be do even better.
You know,

550
00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:26.540
Bahia [inaudible] which are very different,
very Paris.
One is,
uh,
you know,

551
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:29.800
associated more left wing university,
more progressive.
Uh,

552
00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:34.480
Perry of Paki for four category is,
is a more right wing,
uh,

553
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:36.190
university,
uh,
Leon.

554
00:34:36.191 --> 00:34:39.130
Do you know a place like Leon do as opposed to if you have a one in the old

555
00:34:39.131 --> 00:34:40.550
three,
you know,
is going to do very,

556
00:34:40.551 --> 00:34:43.220
very well to lose as can do very well under the system,

557
00:34:43.221 --> 00:34:47.300
won't Pva will do very well.
Maybe they'll be able to raise money from,
from,
uh,

558
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:48.920
uh,
alumni and they're not even,

559
00:34:48.921 --> 00:34:51.830
it doesn't even exist in an alumni association for these places.

560
00:34:51.831 --> 00:34:55.700
They don't even exist.
Uh,
you know,
it's just totally different.
I mean,

561
00:34:56.060 --> 00:35:01.010
even a PR,
a public university in United States like w Michigan,

562
00:35:01.011 --> 00:35:01.940
even in hard times.

563
00:35:01.941 --> 00:35:04.910
And we just are so very well because the University of Michigan is so identified

564
00:35:04.911 --> 00:35:06.010
with,
I'm a little proud of it,

565
00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:10.490
but identified with the state of Michigan or Wisconsin or Berkeley.

566
00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:12.320
I mean Berkeley might have hard times,
but,
but you know,

567
00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:16.640
the California system has so part of the state of California,
but you know,

568
00:35:16.641 --> 00:35:18.680
you're not,
it doesn't do much good to argue to the business.

569
00:35:18.681 --> 00:35:22.010
Whole University is associated with the Department of the dew,

570
00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.520
which is the approximal business song because,
you know,

571
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:27.800
unless the state gives the money there can give me any money coming in.
And so,

572
00:35:27.801 --> 00:35:31.340
uh,
uh,
you have more and more people and uh,

573
00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:37.560
has anybody here been to a French University?
Yeah.
Where were you?
Barclay.

574
00:35:37.561 --> 00:35:38.810
You were in Paris,
weren't you

575
00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.840
when you went to the lectures and all that and stuff like that were they're

576
00:35:42.841 --> 00:35:43.830
enormous numbers of people.

577
00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:47.760
<v 1>Um,
so,
so I feel like</v>

578
00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:50.970
we have a TD is

579
00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.890
<v 0>it totally did whichever sections and things like that.
But the,
the,
I mean,</v>

580
00:35:54.891 --> 00:35:57.260
the way that these are done,
as you would have these huge lectures,

581
00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:00.140
you don't want it.
Why I taught him that I shouldn't,
I get back to the goal,

582
00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:03.770
but in seminary,
but when I taught at the Leon Do,
uh,
I was supposed to,

583
00:36:03.771 --> 00:36:05.030
I didn't pick my courses here.

584
00:36:05.031 --> 00:36:07.760
I'm lucky enough for you all to be able to pick my courses.
They said,
well,

585
00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:12.080
you can do history of urban France cause I've written books on urban France and

586
00:36:12.081 --> 00:36:16.280
then you can do,
um,
uh,
the 1920s and thirties.
And I thought,
aw man,

587
00:36:16.281 --> 00:36:20.630
I don't do that.
And then you can do,
because we live part time in North America,

588
00:36:20.631 --> 00:36:24.140
you can do a history of North America.
And No,
I don't think about that.

589
00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:28.250
And so I'm calling my friends like David Davis and I'm calling my editors Upi in

590
00:36:28.251 --> 00:36:31.750
Norton saying,
please send me all your books on American history.
And,
you know,

591
00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:33.760
and so I'm sitting,
I'm the night before,
you know,
I'm,

592
00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:36.500
I did ridiculous lectures on Quebec.
I don't think about that.

593
00:36:36.501 --> 00:36:38.270
I must have repeated three times by Louis,

594
00:36:38.271 --> 00:36:42.020
the 14th setting boatload of prostitutes because that's about all that I could

595
00:36:42.021 --> 00:36:45.260
remember when I get up there in front of 250 people,
uh,
you know,

596
00:36:45.261 --> 00:36:47.960
speaking about history of North America,
I don't know a damn thing about it.

597
00:36:47.961 --> 00:36:50.600
I might know a little bit about it,
but not to teach it effectively.

598
00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:53.180
But that's just that.
And then also because of the politics,
my,

599
00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:57.530
the person that the dean,
I was at war with my friends there,

600
00:36:57.531 --> 00:37:00.380
so they gave me the worst conceivable schedule where I had to go all the way up

601
00:37:00.381 --> 00:37:02.180
on Friday for an afternoon class.

602
00:37:02.181 --> 00:37:05.540
And my other classes are on Monday and Wednesday and all of this.
But,
but you're,

603
00:37:05.541 --> 00:37:09.650
you're teaching these people and there were three courses on the 1920s and

604
00:37:09.651 --> 00:37:12.080
thirties,
three lecture courses.
And we would get together and say,

605
00:37:12.081 --> 00:37:14.110
what are you going to do?
And we were smart enough to say,
well,

606
00:37:14.111 --> 00:37:16.670
I'll tell you what,
you do the economy stuff and I'll do the,
you know,

607
00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:20.150
political stuff and I will kind of help each other out.
And uh,

608
00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:23.600
you put down a reading list of books that you might hope that they would read

609
00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:28.610
and maybe 10 m eight books maybe or something like that.
A reasonable amount.
And,

610
00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:30.770
but there,
there are bookstores,
but there are no,

611
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:32.390
it's not your thing as course readings.

612
00:37:32.391 --> 00:37:34.610
And what they used to do it at the Sorbonne is they would,

613
00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:40.070
the professors would print out their lectures and you could buy at one of these

614
00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.810
bookstores,
their lecture.
So he said,
well,
hell would,

615
00:37:42.811 --> 00:37:45.410
I'm not going to go to the lecture if they're going to do that,
but,

616
00:37:45.411 --> 00:37:46.610
but what we took it more seriously.

617
00:37:46.611 --> 00:37:48.910
And so we put out these books and now it's to,

618
00:37:48.911 --> 00:37:53.530
as trans students don't have any money,
they have no money.
I mean,
no money.
Uh,

619
00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:56.540
most of them,
unless we had a fancy grounds,
they call it their,

620
00:37:56.570 --> 00:38:00.770
their checkbooks had like Kleenex boxes,
ah,
that,
that they have no money.

621
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:02.410
They can't afford to buy the books.
No.

622
00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:06.940
W in our three classes on the 1920s and thirties,
there were um,

623
00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:12.470
400 students and you know how many copies of the books there were available?

624
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.863
<v 1>One</v>

625
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:19.590
<v 0>in the library and there was another one in the municipal library in Lee Hall.</v>

626
00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.850
So how are you going to read the box?
You're not going to read the books.

627
00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:28.300
How are you going to do on the tests?
Not very well.
I be,

628
00:38:28.301 --> 00:38:31.560
cause you hadn't read the box and the whole course can't be built on the lecture

629
00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:36.520
and then the,
you know,
and then it's,
you know,
but yeah,
it's good.

630
00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:39.400
But I mean it's bad because you have,
they don't do it very good.

631
00:38:39.401 --> 00:38:42.010
So I had students who were comparable to you,
nice people,

632
00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:44.920
but then some of them were just totally clueless and they used to do things
like,

633
00:38:44.921 --> 00:38:46.360
uh,
they were there.
One would bring,

634
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.360
a couple of them would bring these little stars that you have used to put on in,

635
00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:51.560
haven't Catholic first grade,
we'll stars.

636
00:38:51.561 --> 00:38:55.420
You'd put on the big points you want to have and they bring these little stars

637
00:38:55.421 --> 00:38:58.660
and they thought there was still in high school and,
and,
and,
and they'd say,

638
00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:02.680
can I borrow the glue of my neighbor or can I buy that but borrow the eraser of

639
00:39:02.681 --> 00:39:06.160
my neighbor.
And then everything in France has to be three.
So you'd have one,

640
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:08.050
you give them a question and say one,
two,
three.

641
00:39:08.051 --> 00:39:10.480
And some of them would have three points and never made any sense at all.

642
00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:11.890
But there were always three points,

643
00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.190
but in some are just brilliant and some were terrible.

644
00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:17.440
The thing was so sad about this whole system,
and this is really got me,

645
00:39:17.441 --> 00:39:20.560
is that I had to do the travel of DOJ also have one of the courses.

646
00:39:20.561 --> 00:39:23.470
And so somebody wouldn't be there and you'd say,
well,
Modena that met them,

647
00:39:23.471 --> 00:39:26.590
you couldn't to trois them.
And uh,
so I finally end up doing it.

648
00:39:26.591 --> 00:39:29.530
I mean hell with that.
And,
and,
uh,
you'd say whatever happened to my demos,

649
00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.450
they'll eat,
where's met them?

650
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:36.220
Eat mademoiselle x Schipol was,
she's not here anymore.
No,

651
00:39:36.221 --> 00:39:40.260
I guess not.
And you never know.
There'd be a nurse available for,
for,
uh,
you know,

652
00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:44.800
for,
for,
for 20 minutes a week.
And so if somebody was having serious problems,

653
00:39:44.801 --> 00:39:45.491
you would never know.

654
00:39:45.491 --> 00:39:48.220
No one ever followed it up and they just would disappear into the night.

655
00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:52.870
And there was no structure.
I mean,
here,
if you get the sniffles,
we know about it.

656
00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:56.410
Uh,
and you're taking very care of.
But I mean,

657
00:39:56.411 --> 00:39:59.560
even it places that aren't fancy like this,
that's the way it is.

658
00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:03.550
And so the system has never been reformed.
I mean,
even for simple tasks that,
oh,

659
00:40:03.551 --> 00:40:06.340
here I go away,
this,
I'm getting it.
Ah,
what happened?
My lecture hell with it.
But,

660
00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:09.430
uh,
uh,
you know,
waiting in line to Xerox something,

661
00:40:09.431 --> 00:40:13.620
when you've ever waited line be behind that,
you know,
10 geographers all uh,

662
00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:18.460
all xeroxing,
the 14 biggest volcanoes and the tweeter dome.

663
00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:21.070
I mean,
it's just,
it's just mind boggling.

664
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:24.310
And then you're looking at your bell and then use to struggle through the

665
00:40:24.311 --> 00:40:26.980
cigarette smoke.
You know,
hopefully you will see you,

666
00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:30.310
you will see your amphitheater be,
will be,
you know,

667
00:40:30.311 --> 00:40:35.311
somewhere through there and you sort of stagger along through the smoke and then

668
00:40:35.501 --> 00:40:37.000
you,
you know,
and then people talk to,

669
00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:40.090
the other thing is people talk and they used to drive him nuts and they all,

670
00:40:40.091 --> 00:40:41.830
I mean the job too.
I mean,
they're all,
you know,

671
00:40:41.831 --> 00:40:43.730
these guys are always hitting on these women and,
and,

672
00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:47.950
and in your class and stuff is going on.
I once got so mad,
you know,

673
00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:51.340
I gotta to of go to control myself.
I doubled it.
This an amphitheater be,

674
00:40:51.341 --> 00:40:53.440
is this called?
So poetically,
I,

675
00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:57.730
I wa was talking about some damn thing about Nouvelle Foss.
I mean,

676
00:40:57.731 --> 00:41:01.750
I didn't know what I was talking about.
I mean,
Z o z o and I,
you know,

677
00:41:01.751 --> 00:41:05.740
I'm going on anyway,
it doesn't stop me.
And I walked up the,
uh,

678
00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.010
I walk up the stairs and these people are talking a,
they're just talking.

679
00:41:09.011 --> 00:41:11.080
And I stood right in front of him and then they said,
oh,
excuse me.

680
00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:13.600
And then I left and went back down and they start talking again.

681
00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:17.620
Or sometimes you have to be talking to is to ask you if you want to talk.

682
00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:19.650
And they say,
oh no,
no,
excuse me.
And then,

683
00:41:19.651 --> 00:41:22.530
then they go back to their email or they go back to their,
you know,

684
00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:25.090
hitting on their neighbor or whatever.
I mean,
it just,
it was mind blowing,

685
00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:30.550
but the very good students,
but,
but the way that you teach and a Diane has been,

686
00:41:30.551 --> 00:41:32.480
knows a lot about the system to him.
You should ask her,
but,

687
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:35.850
but she was in Britain,
you know,
very,
uh,
uh,
you know,

688
00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:40.020
very good schools and all that there.
But,
but,
uh,
I,
it,
it just is,
it,

689
00:41:40.021 --> 00:41:41.210
it's an incredible thing,
but it's,
so,

690
00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:43.370
it didn't really change very much from after the gall.

691
00:41:43.371 --> 00:41:47.990
So what happened all Charles de Gaulle,
uh,
back to 1968.
What happens to him?

692
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:52.350
Well,
he takes a mysterious,
his trip,
he first,
he goes to Columbia music,

693
00:41:52.351 --> 00:41:57.270
Lee's probably to finish those fully tall,
those,
uh,
cereal's on TV,
uh,

694
00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.313
that he was watching.

695
00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:02.240
And then he disappears and he goes to a button button in Germany.

696
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:06.560
Why did he go to button button in Germany when nobody really knows?

697
00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:11.030
Probably the best explanation as he wanted to make sure that he had the support

698
00:42:11.031 --> 00:42:15.410
of the French army.
Why is the French Army in Boston,
Boston?
Well,

699
00:42:15.411 --> 00:42:19.430
the French armies and bottom bottom because that's part of French territory,
uh,

700
00:42:19.431 --> 00:42:24.200
in the,
the opera opera gear and they're still occupying.

701
00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:29.070
And so he announces that they're going to have a,
a,
that they're going to have a,

702
00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:29.720
uh,

703
00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:34.720
participation and this necessity of a participation in overcoming this crisis.

704
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:38.750
That's the word he uses participation.
He comes back.
And so in the meantime,

705
00:42:38.751 --> 00:42:42.170
there's this huge march down the Sean sleazy to support him.
Uh,

706
00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:44.030
the upper classes,
uh,
uh,

707
00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:49.090
are clear that they will support the Gaullist a response no matter what it is.

708
00:42:49.161 --> 00:42:51.180
That if,
as the army just shooting down students,
but they were,

709
00:42:51.181 --> 00:42:53.990
aren't going to ever do.
But you know,
the brutality of the repression,

710
00:42:53.991 --> 00:42:55.170
they will support that.
Uh,

711
00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:58.370
they're quite happy to see people like Colin Bendy and the others who,
uh,

712
00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:03.260
committed professional suicide go.
Uh,
and,
um,
uh,

713
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:07.910
uh,
basically,
you know,
basically things a calm down.

714
00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:11.290
But the point is that the reforms were never a,

715
00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:14.150
were never really a meaningful reforms.

716
00:43:14.151 --> 00:43:19.151
I think it's safe to say really don't come to the French a university system.

717
00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.960
Uh,
now the French university system,
uh,

718
00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:25.650
is more open to people who are not just,
you know,

719
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:29.090
following their parents along in the university structure.

720
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:33.920
There are more workers,
uh,
sons and daughters and daughters above all now,

721
00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:38.590
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
daughters of,
of uh,
and sons of,
of uh,

722
00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:41.980
a very ordinary people.
We know a good number of,

723
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:46.610
of of people your age or a little older who are university now,

724
00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:50.240
uh,
who are the first people in their,

725
00:43:50.241 --> 00:43:52.640
in the whole history of their families to go to,
uh,

726
00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:56.270
to a university in and happily still at Yale and other places.

727
00:43:56.271 --> 00:44:00.410
One can of thanks to,
to various changes at Yale and these other places,

728
00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:04.580
we can find that.
Now this has changed.
But the problem is that,
uh,

729
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:06.410
as long as the,
uh,

730
00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:11.770
as long as the economy is not able to absorb all these young people when they

731
00:44:12.411 --> 00:44:15.530
get done,
uh,
there is no sense that,

732
00:44:15.531 --> 00:44:18.820
that they're going to be able to go anywhere anyway,

733
00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:22.160
particularly if they want to stay in the region where we live in which there's

734
00:44:22.161 --> 00:44:24.740
not a lot of economic activity.
Thus,

735
00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:29.920
we have one friend who got her master's had gone over and the only job that she

736
00:44:30.531 --> 00:44:35.010
could find,
uh,
for the next two years was working at a Mcdonald's,

737
00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:40.140
uh,
in nobler near Canola.
And now she's working for her parents.
Uh,

738
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:41.063
so I mean,

739
00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:45.750
university the two to make universities more open to all kinds of people.

740
00:44:45.751 --> 00:44:48.360
There's not necessarily solve the problem of what's going to happen to them in

741
00:44:48.361 --> 00:44:52.050
the,
in the long run.
Now,
one of the things that has done that as of course,

742
00:44:52.051 --> 00:44:55.200
it's the box itself and you know,
uh,
that,

743
00:44:55.201 --> 00:45:00.060
that in France you take the baccalaureate exam,
I,
you take the,

744
00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.860
what they call the block,
uh,

745
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:06.060
at about blog after the equivalent of your junior year in high school,

746
00:45:06.061 --> 00:45:08.220
which includes the,
the French Bach,

747
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:12.060
and then you take the real bock at the end.
Now back,

748
00:45:12.061 --> 00:45:13.430
I can't tell you what the number,

749
00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:16.800
the percentage of the people who pass the BOC in 1968 is,

750
00:45:16.801 --> 00:45:21.360
I don't know that it's probably,
was it probably about half,
um,
eh,

751
00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:25.970
or maybe even less.
Of course it's steamed upwards over the last,
uh,

752
00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:30.990
uh,
the last 15 years and it's now approaches 80%.
I mean,

753
00:45:30.991 --> 00:45:34.590
that is still big pressure because you're,
you know,
one exam and it's,

754
00:45:34.591 --> 00:45:38.580
you bet your life because then you can't go to the university if you don't pass

755
00:45:38.581 --> 00:45:41.190
the BOC.
And there's big,
big pressure.

756
00:45:41.191 --> 00:45:45.030
And if you get pretty close by a couple points,
then you know,

757
00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:47.430
you can do it again.

758
00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:51.060
You know that there's a possibility of doing it again within the next couple of

759
00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:51.990
weeks if you're very,
very close.

760
00:45:51.991 --> 00:45:56.240
We had a friend whose mother died and she was obviously very upset and you know,

761
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:59.430
she just barely made missed it.
And so they let her do it again.

762
00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:03.140
So this puts a lot of pressure.
But also,
as I've said before,
that they'll,

763
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:05.070
you guys have streaming,
there are lots of people,

764
00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:09.000
kids who are taken out of the University of the line toward university and

765
00:46:09.001 --> 00:46:10.530
toward passing the buck,
you know,

766
00:46:10.531 --> 00:46:13.680
quite early on because her teachers will invoke the parents and say,

767
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:18.750
your daughter and son,
you know,
has no business being in a school just like that.

768
00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:22.380
I mean,
cruelty of it all.
And then,
you know,
they go off into a different,

769
00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:24.420
different line.
And there are no,
sir,
I've said this before,

770
00:46:24.421 --> 00:46:27.270
but there are no second chances in this system,
which can be a very,

771
00:46:27.271 --> 00:46:32.160
very cruel system.
And not everybody pays,
pack passes the buck.
My,
my,

772
00:46:32.161 --> 00:46:34.970
um,
my son,
uh,
has,
has a,

773
00:46:34.971 --> 00:46:39.750
a buddy who managed to get a one on the Bach,
which is very difficult,

774
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:43.860
uh,
because it's graded from zero to 20.
Uh,

775
00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:48.840
and he managed to get a zero,
uh,
comma,
25 and one thing,

776
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:52.800
uh,
earlier on.
And as well of a,
which is an earlier exam.

777
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:56.910
And so the University of life isn't cut out for everybody.
But,
uh,
I,
I couldn't,

778
00:46:56.911 --> 00:46:59.850
I couldn't,
in all honesty,
as much as I loved teaching in France.
And I do.

779
00:46:59.851 --> 00:47:02.480
And it's not just because of the,
you know,
uh,
I mean,

780
00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:06.480
I love the [inaudible] in French universities.
I,
I really do.
And I feel useful.

781
00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:11.190
Uh,
and,
and it just,
it's,
it's,
it's a lot of fun,
but it's not,

782
00:47:11.191 --> 00:47:15.120
and we've had chances to,
you know,
be there forever,
uh,
you know,
teaching there,

783
00:47:15.121 --> 00:47:17.160
but it's just the conditions,
you know,
they're tough.

784
00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:20.400
They're challenging conditions and,
and basically,
uh,
uh,

785
00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:22.140
it wasn't enough for the gall to say,

786
00:47:22.141 --> 00:47:26.280
we want more participation and to announce an election,
a referendum on,

787
00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:29.460
on regional decentralization.

788
00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:33.880
And that's how we walked off the stage.
And,
uh,
in 1969,

789
00:47:33.881 --> 00:47:36.730
he just goes back to stomps off to Columbia.

790
00:47:36.731 --> 00:47:40.420
They do is at least cause it's a referendum on his,
his leadership.

791
00:47:40.421 --> 00:47:45.190
And that participation isn't enough.
That his,
this big gap between,

792
00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:45.790
uh,

793
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:49.480
talking a good game about grand urine and all of that and not following through

794
00:47:49.481 --> 00:47:54.320
with any kind of meaningful reforms helped generate this crisis.
And,
you know,

795
00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:58.390
one cannot,
I mean it's,
it's pointless.
It's silly.
Look back and say this was,
uh,

796
00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:00.140
the revolution revolution.

797
00:48:00.141 --> 00:48:03.820
Monquet this was the mist revolution that like in 1936,

798
00:48:03.821 --> 00:48:08.680
if Leon Blum and said,
workers of the world take over your factories,
all of them,

799
00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.880
uh,
peasants occupy the fields that you work,
you know,
and it also,

800
00:48:12.881 --> 00:48:14.800
maybe this wasn't going to happen and who knows,

801
00:48:14.801 --> 00:48:17.830
if nothing probably good would've come out that are that anyway.

802
00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:20.470
But a 1968,
uh,

803
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:24.700
was not a revolution that was going to be a meaningful revolution in the end.

804
00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:27.760
I mean,
that generation was right.
I would like to say,
you know,

805
00:48:27.761 --> 00:48:30.110
in opposing US policies,
uh,

806
00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:34.780
in trying to create or insist on a more human world humane world,
uh,

807
00:48:34.781 --> 00:48:38.290
in industrial relations,
uh,
and in the university,
I mean,

808
00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:43.320
but be professors and administrators learn something after all of that,

809
00:48:43.361 --> 00:48:44.670
but in a very centralized,

810
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:47.980
a state where more and more people have because they pass the block,

811
00:48:47.981 --> 00:48:51.940
have back of access to universities that,
that,

812
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:54.310
that isn't necessarily going to solve the problem,
which,

813
00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:58.830
which fundamentally comes down to,
uh,
uh,
uh,

814
00:48:58.831 --> 00:49:02.740
the fact that there are not enough,
uh,
uh,
that there's a real crisis of,

815
00:49:02.741 --> 00:49:06.760
of young people for young people now,
uh,
in France about,

816
00:49:06.761 --> 00:49:10.990
but no light at the end of the tunnel is now argue on Wednesday.
That's part of,

817
00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:14.500
of what's going on in the French suburbs as well.

818
00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:18.100
So if you go to Paris and you walked up the boulevard,
San Michelle,

819
00:49:18.101 --> 00:49:21.730
which is my least favorite boulevard in Paris because it's been destroyed by bad

820
00:49:21.731 --> 00:49:26.290
zoning and has Mcdonald's all over the place,
uh,
and just,
uh,
the tourist hoards,

821
00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:29.320
uh,
uh,
that if you go up there,
I,
you know,

822
00:49:29.321 --> 00:49:33.580
think about these battles pitched battles were fought in 1968 and that merry

823
00:49:33.581 --> 00:49:37.770
month of May and,
and,
and,
uh,
and,
and of barricades and part of,
you know,

824
00:49:37.771 --> 00:49:41.500
revolution as part of French culture,
the memory of revolution.

825
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:44.140
But this revolution really,
uh,
uh,
you know,

826
00:49:44.141 --> 00:49:47.140
days are running down to the prefecture and declaring a new regime are pretty

827
00:49:47.141 --> 00:49:50.690
much over.
And,
uh,
uh,
this revolution,
uh,

828
00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:55.320
a well intentioned,
a full of,
of,
uh,
of color,

829
00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:59.770
full of integrity,
full of,
of character,
full of width.
It was a,

830
00:49:59.771 --> 00:50:01.300
it was a witty revolution,

831
00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:06.220
full of irony and appreciation of the human condition in the end,

832
00:50:06.221 --> 00:50:08.980
uh,
for better,
for worse.
And I think probably for worse,

833
00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:13.520
it didn't get very far.
And to an extent,
uh,
when can,

834
00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:17.140
can look longingly back as,
as you can probably tell,

835
00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:19.600
I still do see on Wednesday.
