WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.760
Okay.
Obviously a France in the 1920s and thirties has to be seen in terms of,
uh,

2
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.560
the international situation,
uh,
in Europe.
Uh,

3
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:13.650
and particularly the rise of fascism.
I mean,

4
00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:18.651
it's easy to describe the 1920s in 1930s as the Europe of extremes.

5
00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:24.630
And it's certainly,
that is certainly the case.
Uh,
and with,
with,
uh,
uh,

6
00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:28.560
the Soviet Union,
uh,
but above all with the rise of,
of,
uh,
the,

7
00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:29.700
the extreme right in,

8
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.790
in Europe by 1939 only I in central and eastern Europe,

9
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.530
uh,
only Czechoslovakia,
which would soon be munched by,

10
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:44.500
uh,
by Germany.
I had not only,
uh,

11
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.110
Czechoslovakia remained a parliamentary regime.
Uh,
and when you think of fascism,

12
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:52.320
you obviously think of Mussolini and taking a national socialism in Germany.

13
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:56.970
But one must also remember that,
that,
that all of the other states,

14
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.590
uh,
in central and eastern Europe became authoritarian states and parliamentary

15
00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:05.130
regime has disappeared one after another.
And then of course,
uh,

16
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.630
I mentioned this in a while,
but the,
the,
the Spanish civil war brought Franco,
uh,

17
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.800
uh,
to power and we could debate long into the night with her.
Franco was a,

18
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.280
it was a fascist or just an authoritarian,
a right wing.
I'm a murderer.

19
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.390
Uh,
but,
um,
I that it was,
it's,

20
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.750
but it was part of the general scheme of things.
And even in countries in which,

21
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:29.430
uh,
uh,
democracy survives,
such as Belgium,
the Netherlands,

22
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.640
France,
which we're going to talk about obviously,
uh,
and Great Britain.

23
00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:35.310
There were active fascist movements as though that,
that in,

24
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:39.870
in Britain led by Oswald Mosley was,
uh,
uh,
was a,
a quite small,

25
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.930
um,
so what I want to do today is discuss the rise of the right,
uh,

26
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.290
in France,
uh,
and then talk about the Popular Front,

27
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.720
uh,
which some people still view today.
It's a real magic moment in,
in,
in,

28
00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:58.440
in French history,
uh,
and,
uh,
the efforts of Leon Blum,
uh,

29
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.610
to create a new political world.
And finally,
uh,
it's,
um,
uh,

30
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.150
it's failure.
And so for the political details of the,

31
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:10.860
of the national block that,
that,
uh,
uh,
came to power immediately after the war,

32
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.280
um,
and the cartel,
they gauche,
um,

33
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.960
the cartel of the left,
uh,
which won the election in 1924.

34
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.950
I will lead leave that,
uh,
to,
uh,
your reading.

35
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.290
But one must remember that,

36
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:29.810
that in all of these countries and in France,
um,
uh,

37
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.050
among them,
uh,
the 1920 seemed to be,

38
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.760
uh,
the,
the temptation of the far right was,
was certainly there.

39
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.390
Mussolini was on the cover of Time magazine eight different times in this

40
00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:46.950
country.
He became known as the man who got the Italian railroads to run on time.

41
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.850
Uh,
even if they only ran in time to the ski resorts that American Journalists,

42
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:54.610
uh,
uh,
to which American journalist tended to go.
Um,

43
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.100
Hitler doesn't come to power until January,
1933.
Uh,

44
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.750
and of course,
Hitler was the most successful of a whole bunch of,
of,
of,

45
00:03:03.751 --> 00:03:07.210
of right wing,
uh,
uh,
uh,
leaders in,
in,
in Germany,

46
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:12.110
all a determined to overthrow the Weimar Republic.
Uh,
so,
uh,

47
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.880
too many people attempted,
for example,
by corporate TISM,

48
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:20.710
the idea that somehow you could eliminate social strife by organizing industries

49
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.800
in a vertical way.
Uh,

50
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.320
mousseline he talked a good game about that and they actually made some efforts.

51
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.810
Uh,
there was this,
this flirtation,
this temptation with,
uh,

52
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.160
the extreme right in the case of France.
Uh,
uh,
what,
what happens in,

53
00:03:34.161 --> 00:03:36.940
in the 1920s and 1930s,
in particularly,
you know,

54
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:41.610
culminating in this day that I'll talk about February 6th,
1934,
uh,

55
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.740
you can see the origins of that before World War One in boot on Jay and in the,

56
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.300
the,
in the case of the Auntie,
a debate through sal.
Um,

57
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.010
so fascism is a European phenomenon and it became a French phenomenon.
Uh,
uh,

58
00:03:57.011 --> 00:04:00.780
as well.
Uh,
the kind of official spokesman,
uh,

59
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.270
represented sort of the Canon of,
of,
of fascist,
uh,
uh,

60
00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:08.830
slot was Lou de la Rochelle is every extremely good biography of him.
Uh,

61
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.880
uh,
several,
uh,
of him,
uh,
he was a novelist.

62
00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:17.080
He's worked with obsessed whose life was obsessed with suicide.
And he became,
uh,

63
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.000
the first of a spiritual leader of French,
a fascist.

64
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.450
Uh,
he wrote an audit matter biographical novel called the zeal,
uh,

65
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.500
which he praised fascism is as being capable of affecting a spiritual revival of

66
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:35.380
what he considered to be a medieval Christianity.

67
00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:38.380
And this would be a theme that would be very important under Vishi,
uh,

68
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:42.700
in the collaboration this year,
years of World War II,
uh,
as well.
Uh,

69
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:45.490
Sean from Oha,
whom we've read about,
uh,

70
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.690
who was the founder of actual phone says and who was a monarchist,
uh,
uh,

71
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:52.990
he also gets into the act any,
any urges France to,
to,

72
00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:55.930
to expand to what he considered.
It's truly natural,
uh,

73
00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:59.830
frontiers that is including the Left Bank of,
uh,

74
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:04.750
of the Rhine River.
Uh,
oxymorphone says,
uh,
uh,
is,

75
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.160
is,
uh,
not really a mass movement the way that some of the other ones would be.

76
00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:11.860
The quad differ though there were,
there were plebeian members of,

77
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.230
of optional phone says,
um,

78
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.000
it was more tied to a monarch ism than it was to the quest for the kind of

79
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:23.140
Mussolini or Hitler kind of dictator.
Uh,

80
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.520
but nonetheless it had considerable influence.
Um,
and in,

81
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.570
in France,
uh,
the,
the extreme right.
Uh,

82
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.720
and Catholicism work closely linked though obviously all practicing Catholics

83
00:05:34.721 --> 00:05:39.460
were not,
uh,
extreme,
uh,
members of extreme right wing of movement,
but,

84
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:41.330
but a morass of sort of view with it,

85
00:05:41.331 --> 00:05:43.420
a monarchy would restore that kind of Christian,

86
00:05:43.421 --> 00:05:48.040
medieval virtue that that was largely imaginary.
Uh,
uh,

87
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:52.540
and that all this would come,
um,
uh,
come to pass,
hopefully in his,

88
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.660
in his lifetime.
Um,

89
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.810
and so they begin to create a unit.
I mean,

90
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.610
that's exactly what happens,
you know,
with,
with the Nazis and,
and,

91
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:04.610
and with the squads,
many of,
of,
of Mussolini,
uh,

92
00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:08.840
in the early 1920s that bring him to power in 1922.

93
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.110
And so the soldiers as in the case of the German fry core,

94
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.070
the free core continue basically just to march.
And so the actual phone says,

95
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.820
takes the kind of tactics,
uh,
that were associated with,

96
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.420
or in the early stages with the blue launch j movement and argument I made

97
00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:28.360
earlier,
uh,
and carry them now,
uh,
into the streets.
Um,
and,
uh,

98
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.800
with the,
the growth of,

99
00:06:29.801 --> 00:06:33.560
of trade union members and France and other countries with the sort of flocking

100
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:35.480
of people too,
didn't say Jta,

101
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:39.980
the confederate Osteo in general due to why the General Federation of Labor.
Uh,

102
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.240
you had the,
uh,
the growth of these right wing,
uh,
groups,
uh,

103
00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:48.320
who asked the German German German counterparts wanted to,

104
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.270
wanted to end parliamentary rural in France.
This,
by the way,

105
00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:56.930
that actual phone says so over the top that it even scares the pope.

106
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.670
And Auction on frost says is condemned by the pope,
uh,
in,
uh,

107
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.070
19,
uh,

108
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.490
26 and indeed lots of members of oxygen from says who were faithful Catholics

109
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.490
leave the movement,
uh,
fearing that they're going to be,
uh,

110
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.870
uh,
excommunicated and a number of other groups,
uh,

111
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.370
us who are even more radical,
a startup.
Uh,

112
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.180
there's one group called [inaudible],
so,
uh,
the FAI,

113
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.300
s c e,
a u,
uh,

114
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.980
which had begun in 1919.
Uh,
but,
uh,
uh,
uh,

115
00:07:30.981 --> 00:07:33.790
increase its membership and believes in violence,

116
00:07:33.791 --> 00:07:36.020
struggle of this kind of action,

117
00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:41.021
this kind of will to power that characterized national socialism as well.

118
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.310
Another of the quad differ,

119
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.290
the cross of fire attracted war veterans.
Uh,

120
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.740
not all of the war veterans,
uh,
ended up,
uh,

121
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.930
supporting the radicals are the socialists or the Communist.
Uh,

122
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.650
a good number of them go into right wing groups.
Uh,

123
00:07:57.651 --> 00:08:00.700
and this is certainly the case with the quad differ.
Uh,

124
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:05.710
it was founded in 1928 as a non political organization and its membership swells

125
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.150
to about 60,000 members.
Now,

126
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:17.120
there has to be money behind these movements as well as,
as well as ideology.

127
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:22.510
And it's kind of interesting that some of those are big money people are behind.

128
00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:27.530
These movements were in luxury,
uh,
in luxury production.
Uh,

129
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.350
Coty for example,
the perfume maker,
uh,

130
00:08:30.351 --> 00:08:34.520
was a big donor and believer in these far right wing clauses and,
and,
uh,

131
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.680
antisemitic causes.
Uh,
so was Tottan Jay Tats,
Nj,
the,
uh,

132
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.610
uh,
the champagne producer,
obviously another luxury good.

133
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:47.900
I once to took a bunch of Yale Alumni,
uh,
we went to APL may and to,

134
00:08:47.901 --> 00:08:51.590
to grasp because they wanted to taste champagne was one of these field trips and

135
00:08:51.591 --> 00:08:54.260
they were very nice group.
And,
uh,
we were,
uh,

136
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:58.650
being taken around the cove of,
of Tangy and I couldn't stand it.

137
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:01.410
They were telling us about what a great patriot heath on Jay was and all this

138
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:04.210
business and his portrait up there.
And I said,
well,
what happened?
What,

139
00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:08.400
what happened during the 1930s.
I couldn't contain myself anymore.

140
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:10.890
What happened in the 1930s and World War Two?

141
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:14.110
And the woman looks terribly embarrassed and passed on to see if we would like

142
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.990
to taste yet another glass of champagne.
And the answer was a resounding yes.
Uh,

143
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.030
but,
um,
so the money,
a lot of the money came from,
from,
from,
uh,

144
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.900
from folks like that.
And then because the newspapers,

145
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.770
I as in the case of Germany and most places were controlled by the right,
uh,

146
00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:31.350
they have,
uh,
uh,
lots of,
of,
of,

147
00:09:31.351 --> 00:09:35.010
of ability to reach a large public [inaudible] himself,

148
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.780
or the name the spelling is ta I,
t.
T.
I.
N.
G.
E.
R,

149
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:44.010
he founds the Patriotic Youth Movement in 1924,

150
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:48.930
which has that by the end of the decade,
100,000 members.
So these are our,

151
00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.390
these are not small groups.

152
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.600
Now you have to the attraction of particularly middle class people to the far

153
00:09:57.091 --> 00:10:00.750
right.
I is characteristic of Germany and Italy as well.

154
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:05.760
And this too has to be seen in the context of the hard times of the 1920s in the

155
00:10:05.761 --> 00:10:10.761
1930s that Europe is basically in depression during the whole time except for

156
00:10:12.121 --> 00:10:16.800
1924 to the big crash in 1929.

157
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.550
Uh,
Eastern Europe is in depression,
agricultural depression,

158
00:10:20.551 --> 00:10:23.970
very severe agricultural depression during the entire time.

159
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.840
And so with,
with the kind of rampant inflation in France,

160
00:10:27.841 --> 00:10:31.100
you didn't have anything similar to,
I mean not nothing,
uh,

161
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.060
comparable to what happens in Germany.

162
00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:37.110
Everybody seen pictures of people pushing shopping carts down the street full of

163
00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:39.960
millions and millions and millions of,
of uh,

164
00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.680
deutschmarks a attempting to buy one single turnip.
Uh,

165
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.960
but the people who get burned and inflation are our,

166
00:10:45.961 --> 00:10:50.961
particularly our middle class people who are on pensions and who have saved

167
00:10:51.421 --> 00:10:54.390
their whole lives for retirement and with inflation,

168
00:10:54.391 --> 00:10:56.700
their savings are wiped out in one single moment.

169
00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.020
In the case of Germany is quite clear because in the early 90 [inaudible] be

170
00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.220
hyperinflation of 22 and 23,

171
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.420
you had these German family wears white families who had to sell silver,

172
00:11:06.421 --> 00:11:10.290
that had been in their families for generation or who had to sell antique arm

173
00:11:10.291 --> 00:11:10.591
arm,

174
00:11:10.591 --> 00:11:14.040
why that had been in their families for generation in order to have enough to

175
00:11:14.041 --> 00:11:15.450
eat and they hate,

176
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:18.600
and they're going to blame somebody for this and who they're going to blame or

177
00:11:18.601 --> 00:11:20.670
the Weimar republic.
And in the case of France,

178
00:11:20.671 --> 00:11:25.290
they're going to blame the very existence of the republic.
And this lapse is in,

179
00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:30.291
does elides into moves into various components of Fascist ideology,

180
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:34.830
uh,
that were shared by all of these movements everywhere,
uh,

181
00:11:34.831 --> 00:11:36.840
is that they're rarely anti-socialist.

182
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.860
Anticommunist Hitler began by hitting before he hated Jews.

183
00:11:40.861 --> 00:11:44.700
He hated Social Democrats.
Uh,
uh,
their auntie a Bolshevik,

184
00:11:44.701 --> 00:11:47.820
their aunt and Auntie.
I'm a socialist or frightened by the,
the,

185
00:11:47.821 --> 00:11:49.890
the revolution in Russia.

186
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:53.290
They're frightened by the fact that these communist parties are doing very well

187
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.860
in the states.
Uh,
they're also virulently anti Semitic,

188
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.290
and they're as arguing awhile xenophobic.
And they,
they,
they,
uh,

189
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:05.140
run those two together because there's a large percentage of the people who come

190
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:09.670
into France,
particularly into Paris and the before World War One or Jews,
uh,

191
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:14.310
uh,
from eastern Europe and from Russia.
Uh,
and,
um,

192
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:18.460
in 1930s,
of course,
during the Spanish civil war,
you have a huge immigration of,

193
00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:23.400
of,
of Spanish refugees fleeing a Franco's death squads,
uh,

194
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.270
and the civil war.
And so they share,
uh,

195
00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:30.940
those characteristics as well.
Moreover,
the French right,
you know,

196
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.260
I've already been clear.
They hate parliamentary regime.
Uh,

197
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:39.040
the Europe of the 1920s and the 30s was the Europe of dictators and they wanted

198
00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:41.270
one.
Uh,
and if,
if,
uh,

199
00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:46.040
Sean Maha and the other action on phone says people wanted a king,
uh,
uh,

200
00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:49.060
there,
there weren't very many likely candidates.
There wasn't,
you know,

201
00:12:49.061 --> 00:12:52.380
it wasn't that there were a pretenders and both lines,
but there wasn't,

202
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:56.170
it wasn't going to just happen through some act of God.
Uh,
and they too could be,

203
00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:01.310
uh,
could come to believe that dictatorship was,
uh,
uh,
was the only way of,

204
00:13:01.311 --> 00:13:05.260
um,
you know,
of,
of solving the social.
And economic problems.

205
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.910
And they're all virulently nationalists.
I mean that,
that the,
the,
you know,

206
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.500
when you're talking about the annexation of the left bank of the Rhine,

207
00:13:11.501 --> 00:13:13.870
or when Hitler's talking about elbows room,

208
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:18.850
a layman's with home elbow room expansion room for the German population,
uh,

209
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:23.710
it is,
is part of this theme of aggressive nationalism.
Uh,
and uh,

210
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:28.420
that also ties into the kind of xenophobia that is behind this entire,

211
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:29.530
uh,
movement.

212
00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:34.690
And so xenophobia emerges as a key characteristic of the far right,
uh,

213
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.420
in France as well.
Now,

214
00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:41.800
because the French population had stopped growing,
uh,
constant seem,

215
00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:44.560
it only grows between 72 by 72,000,

216
00:13:44.561 --> 00:13:49.270
between 1931 in 1936.
And as I said before,

217
00:13:49.271 --> 00:13:54.160
two thirds of the did it pop them all in France had a smaller population in 1939

218
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.230
than they did in 18.
Uh,
uh,
51,
uh,

219
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.810
France has relatively few people under the age,
um,
uh,

220
00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:05.350
under 20 years of age,
only about 31%,

221
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.320
which is extremely low percentage for,
uh,
compared to,
uh,

222
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:13.840
countries that have a really high rate of population growth.

223
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.840
Uh,
and relatively more,
uh,
people,
uh,

224
00:14:16.841 --> 00:14:21.841
who were elderly and beginning in 1935 more people die each year in France and

225
00:14:24.401 --> 00:14:27.160
not just in big cities than are born there.

226
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.140
So who makes up the difference?
Well,
uh,

227
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.290
Italians 720,000,
uh,

228
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.360
in France in 1936 poles,

229
00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:40.930
425 styles and Spaniards,

230
00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:42.850
255 styles.
And,

231
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:47.620
and there'll be lots more by 1939 for obvious regions and Belgium.

232
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.970
Belgium is 195,000.
Uh,

233
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:55.130
but also Jews,
the Jewish population of France,
uh,

234
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.310
it's about 320,000.
Uh,

235
00:14:58.311 --> 00:15:02.660
and half of them had come to France since 1918.

236
00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:07.661
So this immigration of very poor Jews from Poland and from Eastern Europe,

237
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.220
uh,
uh,
continues.

238
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:15.400
And so 7.5% of the French population and late thirties consists of immigrants.

239
00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:20.420
It was the highest popular percentage of any country in Europe.

240
00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.410
Um,
now if you want to also argue why,
with the exception of,

241
00:15:24.411 --> 00:15:29.040
of Oswald Mosley striding around Hyde Park in his,
in his,
uh,
um,

242
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.350
you know,
in his black,
uh,
military like uniform,
uh,

243
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.230
Britain doesn't have much appeal to the far right.

244
00:15:36.231 --> 00:15:39.110
And one of the reasons was is that immigration,
uh,
which is always,

245
00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:43.190
this is this sort of lightening rod for,
uh,
uh,
uh,
for,

246
00:15:43.191 --> 00:15:46.000
for a xenophobia was a,
uh,

247
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:51.470
was relatively small in a London company in England compared to these other

248
00:15:51.471 --> 00:15:56.180
people,
places despite the fact that it was only in London and not in Paris,

249
00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.570
where as early as the 18th century,
and even before that,

250
00:15:59.571 --> 00:16:03.830
you would run into people of color because of the,
uh,

251
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:05.240
of the British empire.

252
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:10.480
So xenophobia is seized upon by these parties as an issue to rally support,

253
00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:16.650
uh,
in elections,
but also on the streets.
Uh,

254
00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.650
and if you think that's not the case,

255
00:16:18.651 --> 00:16:22.470
now look at the success of the National Front,
uh,

256
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.210
in the 1980s in 1990s in France.
Uh,

257
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:31.310
and the kind of violent discourse of the far right in France,
uh,

258
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:36.140
today,
uh,
something,
uh,
to which we will come back to now.
Also,

259
00:16:36.141 --> 00:16:36.980
let me just say,

260
00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:40.700
let me just add that it's not that the parties of the left two are not exempt

261
00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:45.620
from,
from,
from xenophobia.
Uh,
and,
uh,
uh,
uh,
but,

262
00:16:45.621 --> 00:16:50.120
but not to that anywhere to the same,
the same,
um,
uh,
extent that,
that,
uh,

263
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.090
uh,
the,
uh,
the parties of the,

264
00:16:52.091 --> 00:16:55.460
of the far right built their base upon upon xenophobia.

265
00:16:55.461 --> 00:16:58.190
I have a former dissertation student who now teaches at Penn state,

266
00:16:58.191 --> 00:17:03.150
who was a wonderful thesis on,
uh,
so the police,
the way they tracked,
uh,
uh,
uh,

267
00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:07.080
immigrants who were supporters of the Communist Party in Paris in the,

268
00:17:07.081 --> 00:17:11.120
in the 1930s,
uh,
particularly people from West Africa,
uh,

269
00:17:11.121 --> 00:17:15.960
and from,
uh,
from,
from Guadalupe.
And,
and so the flirtation of,
of,

270
00:17:15.961 --> 00:17:20.630
of some,
uh,
immigrants to Paris,
uh,
particularly people of color with,
with the,

271
00:17:20.631 --> 00:17:21.740
the far left,

272
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:26.760
intensifies the hatred of the part by the parties of the far right of,
of,

273
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:31.040
of immigrants.
And their idea of what they called true France.

274
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:34.290
That is this true Catholic,
medieval,
uh,

275
00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:39.340
of France rooted in the soil,
uh,
did not include,
uh,
in their,
uh,

276
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:43.910
fantasies of aggressive nationalism,
did not include,
uh,
immigrants.
Uh,

277
00:17:43.911 --> 00:17:44.950
this is,
you know,
it's,

278
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:50.130
it's an obvious theme from the 1920s and in 1930s,

279
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.150
though,
Hitler with his own,
you know,
his own,
you know,
not uniquely,
but,

280
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:58.830
but over the top pernicious biological,
uh,
view of race,

281
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:03.810
uh,
was the one who took it to its extreme saying that he,

282
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.610
the fuel her,
the,
the leader,
uh,
or the equivalent of the Duci,

283
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:11.820
that's what they called them in,
uh,
in,
in Italy or the cardio in,
in,
in Spain.

284
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.690
He would have the right to say who lives and who dies,

285
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:20.490
who is part of the German Volk,
the German people and who is not.
And of course,

286
00:18:20.491 --> 00:18:22.650
Hitler runs into some difficulty,

287
00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:27.340
very minor with German population because he begins to,
uh,
to,
to,
uh,

288
00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.200
use euthanasia as a tool of the state and to kill people who are handicapped or

289
00:18:31.201 --> 00:18:35.630
mentally retarded,
uh,
uh,
as well as Jews and Gypsies and,
and,

290
00:18:35.631 --> 00:18:39.150
and uh,
and gays,
uh,
right along the way.
And then a lot of Germans say,

291
00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:42.870
wait a minute,
but,
but this,
this,
uh,
these poor people who are mentally retarded,

292
00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:43.171
that you're,

293
00:18:43.171 --> 00:18:46.380
that you're killing or you're ready letting your doctor's experiment on their

294
00:18:46.381 --> 00:18:51.060
real Germans,
do what you want with the others,
uh,
do with what you want with,

295
00:18:51.061 --> 00:18:55.860
with the,
the immigrant Jews or,
or the Jews who were born there and assimilated,

296
00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.770
but leave the real Germans alone.
So,
I mean,

297
00:18:58.771 --> 00:19:03.540
this is an awful kind of discourse even to consider,
but it,
it,
um,
uh,

298
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.080
it,
it is really part of,
uh,
of this great movement,

299
00:19:07.081 --> 00:19:12.081
this groundswell in France as well in other countries against a parliamentary

300
00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:17.130
rule.
Now I'm,
this culminates isn't making a very long story short,

301
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:21.600
but this culminates,
of course,
it's February 6th,
1934.

302
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:26.190
And,
uh,
um,
the phone popular,
the Popular Front,

303
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:27.320
um,
uh,

304
00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:32.320
a political scandal gives the extreme right an opportunity for action.

305
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:34.320
Um,

306
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.760
now this is a country that had all these political scandals before that they had

307
00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:43.130
survived,
uh,
and not just the Dreyfus affair,
but the view.
So unfair and,
and,
and,

308
00:19:43.131 --> 00:19:46.860
and all of this business that we talked about,
uh,
and the Panama Canal,

309
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:51.360
a scandal that we talked about before that discredited the republic.
Um,

310
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:57.410
and so now the republic accuses of not only being soft,

311
00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.580
not virile,
uh,
uh,

312
00:19:59.581 --> 00:20:03.770
full of sort of coralling of rotating ministries,
uh,

313
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:08.400
a weak system without a strong executive authority.
But again,

314
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:13.260
of being,
uh,
uh,
being corrupt.
And drew allow,
Rochelle boasted,

315
00:20:13.261 --> 00:20:16.190
he says,
the France of,
of,
of,

316
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.580
of camping out that is getting up in the morning and plunging into frozen ponds

317
00:20:20.581 --> 00:20:24.330
and the will Vannia and being a boy scout and all of this stuff,

318
00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:27.950
I will conquer the France of the APP at home.
That is the,
the,

319
00:20:27.951 --> 00:20:30.030
the drink after drink before meals.

320
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:34.050
And the rightest shouted down with the France of the APERITIF.
Uh,

321
00:20:34.051 --> 00:20:37.260
what an idea down with the France of the before meal drink.

322
00:20:37.261 --> 00:20:40.500
And it's a matter of fact,
during a 1934 during the heyday,

323
00:20:40.501 --> 00:20:43.180
there were signs posted in cafes,
uh,

324
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.920
around the sham did deputy around the palisade were born.
They said,
no,

325
00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.330
served here.
We just want,

326
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.910
we want people who are against the Republican come in and drink here.

327
00:20:51.911 --> 00:20:56.560
We don't want people who,
who represent the republic.
And,
um,
uh,

328
00:20:56.561 --> 00:21:00.820
the police,
uh,
uh,
make it very difficult to,
uh,

329
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.460
they looked the other way as he sort of right wing groups,

330
00:21:03.461 --> 00:21:08.380
mobilize their forces in the streets.
I mean,
and again,
I said this before,

331
00:21:08.381 --> 00:21:12.700
but it's true that the,
you look at the whole period,
1914 to 1944,

332
00:21:12.701 --> 00:21:16.630
45 is a 30 years war because basically Europe is still at war I,

333
00:21:16.631 --> 00:21:20.890
and it's a war waged on different levels and intellectual level,
a newspaper,

334
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.210
violent headlines Level and,
and battles in the street.
Uh,
and you know,

335
00:21:25.211 --> 00:21:29.860
these people are playing for keeps.
Um,
a very shady character called Sanchez.

336
00:21:29.861 --> 00:21:34.460
Dubiski played by John Paul had been that a Mondo in the film,
um,

337
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:38.950
was Ukrainian Jew who had come to France with his family as a small boy.

338
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:43.900
He made his living basically by cheating people.
He was a con guy.

339
00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:49.480
Um,
his father committed suicide out of shame for the way that his son made his

340
00:21:49.481 --> 00:21:52.630
income.
One of his cleverest projects,

341
00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:57.660
but most deal sated was involving the sale of municipal bonds in that Bosc town

342
00:21:58.631 --> 00:22:03.410
of [inaudible],
uh,
down,
uh,
near the Spanish boarder,
um,

343
00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:07.030
in the Pyrenees Atlantic in the boss.

344
00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.630
I'm a boss country in southwestern France.
Uh,

345
00:22:11.631 --> 00:22:16.380
there was a dummy company that had been created to cover up the operation and,

346
00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:21.440
and lots of reputable insurance companies had invested and lost a lot of money.

347
00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:26.530
US Dubiski had a lot of money because of this and he loved the good life.

348
00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.540
He loved fast cars.

349
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.560
He loved fancy women and he loved spending other people's money.

350
00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:37.720
He loved great restaurants.
Uh,
having a 36 roses delivered to his,

351
00:22:37.721 --> 00:22:40.750
his chosen lover of the evening,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

352
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:44.300
But gradually it all collapses on his head.
And He,

353
00:22:44.301 --> 00:22:46.210
in December,
1933,

354
00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:50.710
he flees to the Alps near Chamonix and he rents the villa.

355
00:22:50.711 --> 00:22:54.100
You didn't just flee to a small room,
uh,

356
00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.780
in Lavonne Shay or someplace like that.
You have to have a villa and,
and,

357
00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.280
and let people know that these are still living very well.

358
00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:03.110
And revelations a pile up.

359
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.650
One after another,

360
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:10.180
a minister of the government had written enthusiastic letter recommending of the

361
00:23:10.181 --> 00:23:13.390
bonds.
Uh,
but it's Dubiski was,

362
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.590
had been protected by an obliging state prosecutor who happened to be the

363
00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:20.650
brother-in-law of the prime minister,

364
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:23.740
a forgettable character called [inaudible] tall.

365
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:29.160
And so actional front says his newspaper has a big headline on the 7th of

366
00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:29.590
January,

367
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:34.590
1934 down with deceives or urging a large protest against the Chamber of

368
00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:40.630
Deputies.
The police are on a [inaudible] trail.

369
00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:44.560
They arrive in Chamonix,
they find out what man dressed,

370
00:23:44.561 --> 00:23:49.561
carry lots of flowers and dressed in white has rented a villa up in the hills.

371
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:55.010
And they get,
as they're moving in to arrest him at this villa,

372
00:23:55.011 --> 00:24:00.011
he blows his brains out and this bursts into a full fledge political crisis,

373
00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:04.970
uh,
that,
uh,
came close to bring down the republic.
Now,

374
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.510
the police didn't bother to call a doctor until they were sure that Stravinsky

375
00:24:08.511 --> 00:24:12.750
was dead.
And this raises all sorts of concern,
uh,

376
00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:17.750
because of the obvious issue that he might reveal a highly placed people with

377
00:24:17.751 --> 00:24:21.140
whom he was working.
He left a suicide note,

378
00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:25.250
signed a to his son,
signed you're unhappy Daddy.

379
00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:26.990
And it might've been forged.

380
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.750
There was something not quite right about the writing.

381
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.860
That's Dubiski was a Jew caused all of the,
and he might have been,
you know,

382
00:24:33.861 --> 00:24:37.010
it's something else,
but he happened to be a Jew,
uh,
caused,
uh,

383
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.820
the right wing organizations,
uh,
to go wild.

384
00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:45.840
And the demonstrations became nothing less than an attack on the Republican

385
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:50.750
demonstrations turned into riots,
uh,
particularly after another minister,

386
00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.050
uh,
is implicated in the state scandal and short,
tall bags.

387
00:24:54.051 --> 00:24:58.700
It on the 27th of January.
And there's another,

388
00:24:58.701 --> 00:25:02.540
there's another coalition government,
yet another one that this has caused,
uh,

389
00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:05.870
to come into existence.
Uh,
Shakespeare.

390
00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.540
Shakespeare has a play Coriolanus,
uh,

391
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:11.270
a play that has strong authoritarian implications,

392
00:25:11.271 --> 00:25:13.760
was wildly applauded that the comedy fall says,

393
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.780
and the young patriots vowed a sweep away.
The Socialist Party,

394
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:22.550
the Communist Party and dirty Jewish finance.
Uh,

395
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:27.830
the police,
the prefect of police is a guy called John [inaudible],
c h,
a.

396
00:25:27.831 --> 00:25:29.300
P.
P.
E.

397
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.380
He appeared quite unconcerned with the right wing riots in the streets,

398
00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:38.450
but he ordered the bashing of any leftwing heads that could be seen,
uh,
when,

399
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.000
uh,
the new head of the government,
a Dell Ida,

400
00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:45.770
whom you can read about called shop telling him of his dismissal.

401
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:50.780
The policemen refused to be sent to Morocco and promised that he would be in the

402
00:25:50.781 --> 00:25:55.760
street,
uh,
uh,
suggesting to Dillard,
Yay.
Not a fear of unemployment,

403
00:25:55.761 --> 00:25:57.800
that he was going to be in the street because he's unemployed.

404
00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.040
But a promise to lead,
uh,
the overthrow of the republic.

405
00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.710
And on February 4th,
1934,

406
00:26:03.711 --> 00:26:08.360
every grit right wing group plans to meet in,
uh,
in,
um,

407
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.130
before the Chamber of Deputies.

408
00:26:10.131 --> 00:26:12.530
They marched on the Sean sleazy or come from other direction.

409
00:26:12.531 --> 00:26:15.900
My favorite group in this is one small group of people,
uh,

410
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:19.760
are marching down the street and down and they're all ready to go and join the

411
00:26:19.761 --> 00:26:22.820
others.
They look at somebody who looks at his watch and said,
well,
it's seven 30.

412
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:26.660
[inaudible] and so they leave and they say it's time to eat.

413
00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:30.140
And so they leave the demonstration to go eat and then they miss the whole thing

414
00:26:30.141 --> 00:26:33.110
cause they're having some sort of lavish meal someplace.

415
00:26:33.111 --> 00:26:35.360
I wouldn't have been any right wing demonstration,
but I would have left.

416
00:26:35.361 --> 00:26:37.490
I could tell you to go eat,
uh,
as well.

417
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.830
And so that what happens is they go sailing,
they go charging across the,
the,

418
00:26:41.831 --> 00:26:46.080
the San River.
Uh,
they're trying to liberally overthrow the republic.
Uh,

419
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:47.400
their debates,
whether it was just a,

420
00:26:47.401 --> 00:26:51.500
it was a real coup d'etat tamped and overthrow or whether this demonstrating,
uh,

421
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:55.690
the police,
uh,
badder than back.
I have an uncle who was a communist who,
uh,
uh,

422
00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:59.520
was doing a psychoanalytic training in,
in Berlin in those days.
And,

423
00:26:59.521 --> 00:27:02.760
and there was a very active communist and he claims to have been a counter

424
00:27:02.761 --> 00:27:06.360
demonstration I and who have been grazed by a bullet because the communists were

425
00:27:06.361 --> 00:27:09.180
there as a,
as a counter demonstration.
And I don't know,

426
00:27:09.181 --> 00:27:13.230
his stories became a more and more,
uh,
uh,
lavish over the years.

427
00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:17.670
But he was a wonderful man.
Um,
and he probably,
and he probably was there,
so,
um,

428
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.000
there were 14 demonstrators killed and several thousand injured.

429
00:27:21.001 --> 00:27:25.770
So this is a very big,
uh,
event and several hundred policemen.
Also,
we're,
um,

430
00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:29.670
we're hurt a Dell ida resigns on February 8th.

431
00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:32.700
But the big significance of this event was it,

432
00:27:32.701 --> 00:27:37.500
this is a real attempt to overthrow the republic.
And on February 12th,

433
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.820
the largest demonstrations in French history,
uh,

434
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:45.830
until 1968 occurred in every single prefecture and France outside of two or

435
00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:47.310
three,
uh,

436
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:52.020
in defense of the republic and the Popular Front,

437
00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:55.830
that alliance between the radicals whom you remember our socially moderate,

438
00:27:55.831 --> 00:27:59.490
but very anticlerical,
but they have lost their rezone death a little bit.

439
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.500
The Socialists and the communists.

440
00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:06.870
This alliance to save the Republic against fascism emerges out of this fat

441
00:28:08.491 --> 00:28:13.491
Acompli of these popular demonstrations of people pouring in to,

442
00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:19.080
uh,
into this treat.
Millions of French men and women and children March,
uh,

443
00:28:19.081 --> 00:28:22.770
in France,
it's followed by a 24 hour strike.
Uh,

444
00:28:22.771 --> 00:28:26.880
this Dubiski affair was kept alive by the discovery of the mangled body of the

445
00:28:26.881 --> 00:28:28.920
public prosecutor of the Paris court,

446
00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.450
which had been tied down on the railroad tracks.
Uh,

447
00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:37.430
so that he was a clock by the five 12,
uh,
train between Paris and,

448
00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:42.420
and does y'all,
uh,
and cut in half.
Uh,

449
00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:44.970
the,
uh,
the,
the,

450
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:49.230
the republic seem to have a new lease on life,

451
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:50.940
but as one of his critics said,

452
00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:55.050
it could also be called a new lease on death,

453
00:28:55.470 --> 00:29:00.240
but something had been changed because the three major parties had been,

454
00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:04.530
uh,
had been frightened.
Now in 1920,
you will know,

455
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:09.360
you will remember that at the Congress of tool,
uh,
the communist party,

456
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:14.600
a split away from the Socialist Party and the Communist Party retains some

457
00:29:15.751 --> 00:29:20.230
elements of that old guest party that you remember.
Uh,

458
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:23.220
did I'll be discussing before world war one.

459
00:29:23.221 --> 00:29:24.540
It was not discussing before we're all one,

460
00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.820
but we discussed it before we got to World War One.
Uh,

461
00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:31.740
in that it was a sort of a top down,
uh,
organization,

462
00:29:31.741 --> 00:29:34.410
the democratic centralism decisions made at the top,

463
00:29:34.411 --> 00:29:39.150
and then informing the party faithful of what they would be,
uh,
uh,

464
00:29:39.151 --> 00:29:44.080
was an essential part of,
uh,
in 19 2122 and 23,

465
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.810
uh,
uh,
mostly 22,
23,
if I remember correctly,

466
00:29:46.811 --> 00:29:50.550
the communists intellectuals were thrown out of the party.
Uh,

467
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.150
the Communist Party,
uh,

468
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:57.080
quite slavish Lee a bade every order that came from Moscow,
uh,

469
00:29:57.081 --> 00:30:01.930
its leaders were a minors,
like to has a or industrial workers.

470
00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:06.100
Uh,
but because they provided very good social services,

471
00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:10.660
particularly in the red belt,
those suburbs around Paris,
uh,
had,
uh,

472
00:30:10.661 --> 00:30:14.820
had the prestige that long predated,
uh,

473
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:18.320
the real role,
heroic role of communist resistance,
uh,

474
00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:21.130
in World War Two.
Uh,

475
00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:26.130
but they considered Leon Blum and the Socialist Party,
uh,

476
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.470
to be anathema.
For one thing bloom was,
was a,

477
00:30:29.471 --> 00:30:34.330
was a bourgeois himself and the socialist party was willing to compromise with

478
00:30:34.331 --> 00:30:38.410
other parties.
Was reformist a party in this tradition of John.

479
00:30:38.411 --> 00:30:43.360
John Has Leon Blum,
who was born on the,
and a knee in Paris.

480
00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:46.850
Uh,
there's still a plaque.
There was an intellectual,
uh,

481
00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:50.200
he was a literary critic.
He was a writer.

482
00:30:50.201 --> 00:30:53.050
He had written a pamphlet on,
called on marriage,

483
00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:57.130
which is considered scandalous before war one in which he said it was okay not

484
00:30:57.131 --> 00:30:58.600
to marry,
but simply,
you know,

485
00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:01.820
be with somebody and all of that for a long period of time.

486
00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:05.410
It was a recognition of the fact that in many places,
people weren't married,
uh,

487
00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:09.400
simply lived together and in particularly in large cities and particularly in

488
00:31:09.401 --> 00:31:12.120
Paris,
and is your ass was killed on the 31st of July,

489
00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:17.140
1914 Leon Blum was the logical successor of Joe has,

490
00:31:17.171 --> 00:31:21.370
he had an ability to bring people in a room and to get them unified and,
and,

491
00:31:21.371 --> 00:31:22.204
and he,
uh,

492
00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:27.190
and he becomes the dominant figure in the Socialist Party.

493
00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:31.800
But Leon Blum,
there was something else about him that mattered as well,
uh,

494
00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.770
in the Popular Front and the France before that is it.

495
00:31:34.771 --> 00:31:36.880
Leon Blum was also Jewish.

496
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:41.680
And the one thing that you heard from 1934,
1935,

497
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:45.790
1936,
is well dressed,
uh,
uh,

498
00:31:45.791 --> 00:31:50.680
students probably from the fuck a Da da Sausa,
uh,
in,
in,
in Paris,

499
00:31:50.681 --> 00:31:54.850
right wing students,
a shouting better Hitler than bloom.
And at one point,

500
00:31:54.851 --> 00:31:58.510
Leon Blum was pulled out of his car and the root days they call near the

501
00:31:58.511 --> 00:32:02.200
Sorbonne and,
and almost beaten to death by right wing thugs.

502
00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:06.760
Leon Blum was Jewish now,
uh,
and he was an intellectual.

503
00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:08.200
So it,

504
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:12.850
the communist party in a way was the case of the tail wagging the dog because it

505
00:32:12.851 --> 00:32:15.850
was the communist militants that really demanded that some,

506
00:32:15.851 --> 00:32:18.550
that there'd be a block against fascism,

507
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:23.750
but the communist party finds itself allied with,

508
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.620
uh,
the Socialist Party.
And these are not small numbers.

509
00:32:26.621 --> 00:32:29.740
The number of people in the Communist Party,
there were by 1936,

510
00:32:29.741 --> 00:32:34.540
they were 330,000 members of the Communist Party.
And again,
I mean,

511
00:32:34.541 --> 00:32:37.480
there are particularly powerful in the red belt around Paris,
but,

512
00:32:37.481 --> 00:32:41.610
but big influence and in places like the Rda and then,
yeah,
in,

513
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:45.380
in the board room.
And a essentially,
uh,
you know,

514
00:32:45.381 --> 00:32:49.190
in the industrial regions of the north,
they do very,
very well,
uh,

515
00:32:49.191 --> 00:32:52.850
places where the Geddes had done well,
uh,
in,
in the 19th century.

516
00:32:52.851 --> 00:32:54.110
So they do really well among,

517
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:57.680
among industrial workers and above all among railroad workers.

518
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:59.090
And that's still the case today.

519
00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:03.530
The shemy know the railroad engineers and the railroad workers still,
you know,

520
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:05.450
the company's Party's lost most influence,

521
00:33:05.451 --> 00:33:06.830
but the influence of the party and the,

522
00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.730
and the General Confederation of Labor is still seen whenever there's a big

523
00:33:10.731 --> 00:33:14.390
train strike and France and you're stuck in a station for,
you know,

524
00:33:14.391 --> 00:33:17.660
hours and hours because the train is,
it is not coming.

525
00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:23.030
And so in the meantime,
government after government,
uh,
uh,

526
00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:27.200
uh,
it follows,
um,
and so,
uh,

527
00:33:27.201 --> 00:33:28.820
in June,
1934,

528
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:33.140
the communist party repudiates what they called class versus class strategy that

529
00:33:33.141 --> 00:33:36.300
is making possible the alliance now with the Bourgeois,

530
00:33:36.301 --> 00:33:38.420
a party that is the Socialist Party.

531
00:33:38.421 --> 00:33:42.220
Lots of workers support the socialist parties.
But for the Communist Party,
uh,

532
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.320
the,
it was a socialist party was inevitably the boars wild party.

533
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.550
That was their discourse.

534
00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:50.900
And the three parties meet and per po prepare a compromise program that

535
00:33:50.901 --> 00:33:54.140
incorporated tax reform,
a shorter work week,

536
00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:56.750
increased unemployment benefits,

537
00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:02.020
international disarmament support for the League of nations and the dissolution

538
00:34:02.391 --> 00:34:06.080
of the fascist leagues.
You can get this out of the book,
but basically that's it.

539
00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:10.940
Um,
so,
uh,
on the 7th of March,
1936,

540
00:34:10.941 --> 00:34:15.941
German armies moving into the Rhineland and now the threat to the republic

541
00:34:15.981 --> 00:34:20.240
inside France scene's been marched by Hitler's a winning the big bluff,

542
00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:24.850
uh,
against,
uh,
the League of nations and against the allied powers.
I,

543
00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:29.220
after World War One,
and in fact,
killers general said,
you know,
[inaudible],

544
00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.260
I wouldn't do this because our army is weak.
Now we're rebuilding.

545
00:34:33.261 --> 00:34:33.711
They were already,

546
00:34:33.711 --> 00:34:38.060
their pilots are being trained by Soviet pilots already a way before the rub,

547
00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:42.900
a Molotov Ribbentrop Pat Ribbentrop Pact of 1939,
uh,

548
00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:43.641
they said,
you know,

549
00:34:43.641 --> 00:34:46.490
my fear that I wouldn't do this because even the Belgian army and the French

550
00:34:46.491 --> 00:34:49.280
army,
you know,
it's hard to imagine the Belgian army very strong,
but,

551
00:34:49.281 --> 00:34:52.750
but the German army member had been dismissed.
Demobilize essentially.
Uh,

552
00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:57.110
and Hitler.
Hitler says we're going to do it anyway,
and he gets away with it.

553
00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:59.900
So what this does is it leads to,

554
00:34:59.901 --> 00:35:02.810
in the elections of May of 1936,

555
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:07.550
a victory of the Popular Front,
57% of the vote,

556
00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:12.290
um,
with the Socialist Party.
Now the largest party in France,

557
00:35:12.291 --> 00:35:17.291
and they have 386 of 608 seats in the Chamber of Deputies.

558
00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:19.371
Now,

559
00:35:19.371 --> 00:35:23.750
the Communists refused to participate in the cabinet because they don't want to

560
00:35:23.751 --> 00:35:25.130
be associated with any failure,

561
00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:30.080
but yet they're adding to this mix of three has made the victory,
uh,

562
00:35:30.081 --> 00:35:34.070
possible.
And so Leon Blum becomes prime minister on the 3rd of June,

563
00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:38.160
1936 with,
we know,

564
00:35:38.161 --> 00:35:42.660
under threats all the time because of the fact he was Jew Jews.
Oh,
he was a Jew.

565
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:44.303
Um,

566
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:49.340
now what happens next is that the largest wave of strikes in France until that

567
00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:51.000
year,
again,

568
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000
1968 breaks out because workers encouraged by the,

569
00:35:56.431 --> 00:36:00.230
the Popular Fronts preelection promises.
Now,
uh,

570
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.940
go on strike in June,
1936,

571
00:36:02.941 --> 00:36:07.941
there 12,000 strikes involving 2 million workers,

572
00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:11.940
more strikers than anytime.
And for the first time ever.

573
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:15.120
Now this happens also in Flint and Detroit at the same time,

574
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.640
workers occupied factories,

575
00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:21.660
they occupied factors they put on guerrilla theater or they do performances in

576
00:36:21.661 --> 00:36:25.760
which they play the,
you know,
some guy plays the bad guy,
the boss or the,
the Co,

577
00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:30.780
the cultural mathical,
the,
the foreman,
uh,
or the Pinkerton,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

578
00:36:30.781 --> 00:36:34.710
So they're occupying these factories in places like knots and Boulogne belong

579
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:39.570
the bigger an olfactory outside of Paris.
Um,

580
00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:43.380
and so it,
you know,

581
00:36:43.381 --> 00:36:48.060
there are preexisting grievances,
a conditions of work.
Taylorism,

582
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.690
a worker remembered.
There are two factors in the slavery that we face.

583
00:36:51.691 --> 00:36:55.830
Speed and orders.
One must must,
well,
putting myself in front of the machine,

584
00:36:55.831 --> 00:37:00.300
kill one soul,
eight hours a day.
One's thoughts,
one's feelings,
everything.

585
00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:04.470
Pete workers in France still refer to the factory is a bind ya a Banya is a

586
00:37:04.471 --> 00:37:08.310
prison bag.
And He,
uh,
again,
the idea that you're,

587
00:37:08.311 --> 00:37:11.890
you're a prisoner there while you're there and you're under the direct orders
of,

588
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:16.500
of the foreman or the boss,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
And um,
what,
what,

589
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:20.760
what is interesting is that the strikes take the labor federations and the

590
00:37:20.761 --> 00:37:25.710
communist party by surprise,
the communist leaders say,
wait a minute,

591
00:37:25.711 --> 00:37:29.310
what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Is the tail wagging the dog?

592
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:34.530
And they say,
memorably everything is not possible.
And the workers reply,

593
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:39.240
everything is possible and they don't want to lose the influence of the party.

594
00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.310
And this isn't the first,

595
00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.870
the last time this would happen because it happens in 1968 also the comments,

596
00:37:43.871 --> 00:37:45.300
as I said,
what are you people striking?

597
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:48.450
We didn't give you orders to go on strike.
What do you think you're doing?

598
00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:52.950
What they thought they were doing is representing their own interests.
Um,

599
00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:57.480
and so humanity,
the Communist newspaper has a huge,
uh,
title groty.

600
00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:01.050
Everything is not possible.
But,
uh,

601
00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:06.380
now who should Leon Blum have called on the workers and the peasants to initiate

602
00:38:06.631 --> 00:38:11.220
them a more radical form of,
of Popular Front.
Uh,
well,
you know,

603
00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:15.000
probably not.
But what he does is he calls the government,
uh,

604
00:38:15.001 --> 00:38:18.360
and the employers that they're all gonna get together and meet and they form,

605
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.210
they do what they're called the Martino agreements.

606
00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:26.010
I'm sure I didn't write this on the board.
I should have mat I,
G,
N,
O,
n,

607
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:29.040
which are a great victory for the workers.

608
00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:34.250
The employers accepted the unions as the representatives of their workers and

609
00:38:34.411 --> 00:38:39.340
would negotiate with the unions and give them a raise of 12 to 15%.

610
00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:42.850
They promised the 40 hour a week.
And we take that for granted.

611
00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:46.630
And France is a big issue over the 35 hour week,
as I'm sure you know,

612
00:38:46.631 --> 00:38:51.631
and they give paid vacations and the paid vacation of a month with many people

613
00:38:52.211 --> 00:38:55.960
now in France can't afford to take,
comes out of the Popular Front.

614
00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:00.130
They also opened up the Louvre free certain days of the week on Sunday,

615
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:04.310
the sort of a culture revolution as well.
And the,
and there you see all kinds.

616
00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:07.210
There's me.
I wish we had three hours to talk about this,
but you probably don't,

617
00:39:07.211 --> 00:39:09.660
but I do.
But,
uh,
that,
that they,
they,

618
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:13.300
they're these great postcards at pictures of people had never seen the ocean

619
00:39:13.301 --> 00:39:16.900
that live 50 miles or 50 kilometers from the ocean.
People from Ras,

620
00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:21.630
and they go to [inaudible],
which is near Dunkirk,
which of cold frozen beach.

621
00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.370
And,
and they're so proud and they're there in their bathing suits,
free,

622
00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:26.590
modest bathing suits,

623
00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.740
and they have their pictures together with the sea behind them.

624
00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:34.630
Something they'd never seen before.
And lots of her working class resorts,
uh,

625
00:39:34.631 --> 00:39:35.920
developed during that time.

626
00:39:35.921 --> 00:39:39.410
Not Everybody can afford to go to central pay or Dovii or,

627
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:44.350
or via heats,
uh,
or South [inaudible] or God forbid,

628
00:39:44.351 --> 00:39:46.990
con and places like that.
Uh,

629
00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:50.920
so the working class vacation begins then.
And that's a great moment.

630
00:39:50.921 --> 00:39:53.680
That's a magic moment.
That's an,
that's an important moment.

631
00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.630
And when we live in a country,
which nobody ever takes vacation,

632
00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:58.270
people that are rich can't afford to take vacations,
you know,

633
00:39:58.271 --> 00:39:59.830
they make all this money.
What are they going to spend it?
Well,

634
00:39:59.831 --> 00:40:03.120
this get another 500 video games or something like that.
You know,

635
00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:07.450
what are they going to do?
Uh,
uh,
and you know,
in France,
the right to a vacation,

636
00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.190
even a few you can't afford to take.
Now.

637
00:40:09.191 --> 00:40:12.490
People just take smaller vacations than they could before.

638
00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:15.910
That's an important conquest and it came from the Popular Front and it's great,

639
00:40:15.911 --> 00:40:19.960
great,
great sing.
Now the wealthy French families don't like this very much.

640
00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:25.030
What happens if these people come to our resorts speaking like they do,

641
00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:30.340
looking like they do,
they don't like it.
What kind of,
is this your new,

642
00:40:30.341 --> 00:40:34.420
hey,
put beacon pope you that you know,
after all.
And so,

643
00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:40.180
uh,
the,
the,
the,
the strikes,
uh,
the,
the,
the strikes gradually end.

644
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:44.830
But why does the Popular Front fail in the long run?
In a way?

645
00:40:44.831 --> 00:40:49.540
Everything wasn't possible.
It wasn't possible.
Um,

646
00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:55.020
one of the reasons that fails is because of course the employers have no,
no,
uh,

647
00:40:55.021 --> 00:40:56.460
idea of,
of,
of,

648
00:40:56.590 --> 00:41:00.040
of holding to what they had agreed to and they violate every conceivable

649
00:41:00.041 --> 00:41:03.260
contract they can as quick as quickly as possible.
Um,

650
00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:07.780
but the economic crisis,
uh,
uh,
you know,
if you're trying to make,

651
00:41:07.781 --> 00:41:11.620
make France more productive and people put people back to work at the time,

652
00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:15.580
the strategy of having people work less or for that matter going out on strike

653
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:18.680
economically didn't really work.
It does.
I mean,

654
00:41:18.681 --> 00:41:21.550
the Francis of was a more agricultural country than say,

655
00:41:21.551 --> 00:41:22.900
Germany or the United States or Britain.

656
00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:27.130
And so the depression comes longer and it stays,
you know,
I mean,

657
00:41:27.131 --> 00:41:27.851
it comes later in,

658
00:41:27.851 --> 00:41:31.280
it stays longer than the u s doesn't get out of the depression.
And really,
uh,

659
00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:35.050
until the armaments,
uh,
19,
um,
you know,
a,

660
00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:39.320
a World War World War II.
Um,
and you know,

661
00:41:39.321 --> 00:41:42.690
the export of currency,
what wealthy people do and France and other countries.

662
00:41:42.691 --> 00:41:46.490
So they start taking money and,
uh,
cash gold,

663
00:41:46.491 --> 00:41:49.970
silver out of the country.
They take them to Switzerland.
They still do that.

664
00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:51.710
I mean,
and especially in the 1990s,

665
00:41:51.711 --> 00:41:55.280
they were having to control the trains to Switzerland and Bruce l develop them

666
00:41:55.281 --> 00:41:57.530
because people were taking money out of the country and all of that,

667
00:41:57.531 --> 00:42:01.460
and not declaring,
declaring what they had his income.
I mean,
that,
that's the,

668
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:05.840
you know,
it just happens all the time.
Um,
so,
uh,
uh,

669
00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:10.970
it blossomed,
does not allow,
loomed is not a,
I'll put controls on currency,

670
00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.360
uh,
constraints on currency,
uh,
uh,

671
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:18.400
because of opposition from the British and the United States and other places.

672
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:19.221
And so at this point,

673
00:42:19.221 --> 00:42:24.221
the Popular Front begins to unravel a ideologically the reform of Socialist

674
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:25.360
Party and the Communist,
uh,

675
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:29.030
remain a world of part lay on is not going to say occupy permanently.

676
00:42:29.031 --> 00:42:32.860
The factories take over the means of production.
That's all there is to it.
No,

677
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:37.130
he wasn't going to do that.
Um,
in,
in March,
in 1937,

678
00:42:37.131 --> 00:42:41.440
the police fire on workers demonstrating against the quad tougher,
uh,

679
00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:46.250
in the Parisian suburb of Clichy and the Communist Party denounces the

680
00:42:46.251 --> 00:42:51.200
government,
the French stock market goes into a,
a tumble various advisors,
uh,

681
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:53.140
um,
uh,
uh,

682
00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:58.180
resign a reducing confidence in blems economic policy in Leon blooms economic,

683
00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:03.270
uh,
policies.
And the government had to devalue the frank several times,
uh,

684
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:07.940
because of the flow of gold abroad and the French,
um,
uh,

685
00:43:07.941 --> 00:43:12.800
financial,
uh,
community denounces,
uh,
Leon Leon Blum.

686
00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:17.870
Um,
but there's another reason too,
uh,
that undercuts the Popular Front.
And this,

687
00:43:17.871 --> 00:43:19.300
of course it's Spain,
uh,

688
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:24.520
because those people who lived in the late 1930s people who were intellectuals,

689
00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:28.490
uh,
people who were students at Yale and Columbia and MIT,

690
00:43:28.491 --> 00:43:32.150
Michigan and Tau and other places.
Uh,

691
00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:37.150
the war in Spain was seen as a war of civilization.
Uh,

692
00:43:37.151 --> 00:43:40.710
at the time people realized that it was a dry run for a,

693
00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:44.900
another big war that was going to come along that sometime fascism had to be

694
00:43:44.901 --> 00:43:49.010
stopped.
Uh,
and,
uh,
Franco,
uh,
his military legions,

695
00:43:49.011 --> 00:43:51.650
he was actually number three on the list,
but the first two were killed.

696
00:43:51.651 --> 00:43:53.440
One in combat,
I guess in the,
in the,

697
00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:57.260
the other one in a plane accident flying from Portugal into Spain.
Uh,

698
00:43:57.261 --> 00:44:02.261
the revolution a counterrevolution the really starts in 1936 in Morocco and then

699
00:44:02.901 --> 00:44:06.710
in Spain.
Uh,
and by 1939,
uh,

700
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:08.630
in a very bloody atrocity,

701
00:44:08.631 --> 00:44:12.200
full war on both sides of the atrocities were overwhelmingly on the side of the

702
00:44:12.201 --> 00:44:15.600
fascists.
Have no question about that.
Um,

703
00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:18.800
the question was what was going to happen in Spain and some of the great

704
00:44:18.801 --> 00:44:20.780
literature that came out of that period.

705
00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:24.560
Obviously it's George Orwell's homage to Catalonia or Borkin Hour Brennan.

706
00:44:24.561 --> 00:44:27.440
There's all sorts of great books on Spain from people who were there.

707
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:30.530
The international brigades were full of people from Yale and Columbia and Oxford

708
00:44:30.531 --> 00:44:31.650
and Cambridge,
uh,

709
00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:36.280
and the unions in Detroit going over to fight the good fight against fascism.
Uh,

710
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:38.910
but nobody gave arms to Spain.

711
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:43.890
Nobody gave arms to Spain except the Germans gave arms to,
uh,

712
00:44:43.891 --> 00:44:48.450
the authoritarians of Franco.
The Italians tried out there,
their tanks there.
Uh,

713
00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:51.890
the guarantee of the most famous painting of the period of,
of,

714
00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:55.530
of Picasso French should visit guarantee has sometime came when,
uh,

715
00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.350
they distract strafe and vomits civilian population.

716
00:44:58.351 --> 00:45:01.740
It was German planes doing it.
Uh,
on behalf of Franco.

717
00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:05.850
And Leon Blum goes to the plastic republic and they're thousands and thousands

718
00:45:05.851 --> 00:45:10.470
of people and they're screaming arms for Spain,
arms for Spain,

719
00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:15.690
arms for Spain.
And with tears pouring down his cheeks,
he said,

720
00:45:15.691 --> 00:45:18.960
I can't,
I can't.
Well,
why couldn't he?

721
00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:23.820
Because the British and the Americans didn't want him to do that.
They viewed,
uh,

722
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:24.350
the,
they,

723
00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:28.620
they viewed this as being a internationalization of a war which had already

724
00:45:28.621 --> 00:45:30.150
become internationalized.

725
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:32.970
And Spain did not get the weapons that needed to survive.

726
00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:38.160
And Franco's regime last until 1975.
November,

727
00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:42.810
1975 when he finally,
uh,
expired the war,
you know,

728
00:45:42.811 --> 00:45:45.390
that was one of the warrant.
Spain was one of those moments.
You can look back,

729
00:45:45.391 --> 00:45:48.510
and I already suggested this,
that maybe if they'd stopped Hitler,
you know,

730
00:45:48.511 --> 00:45:51.720
when they invade,
invade the Rhineland,
maybe history would have been different.

731
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:56.360
Could have been.
You never know.
And maybe if they stopped Franco in,

732
00:45:56.361 --> 00:46:00.150
in 19,
uh,
36 to 1939 and in doing so,

733
00:46:00.151 --> 00:46:03.750
stop the Germans and Italians,
maybe history would have been different.

734
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:06.260
And all of these,
uh,
50,
50,

735
00:46:06.310 --> 00:46:11.310
who can count 50 million or 60 million or about people who died,
uh,

736
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:13.770
wouldn't have died.
Who knows?
It's looking back.

737
00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:17.370
But as so far as of Popular Front,
it's survived.

738
00:46:17.371 --> 00:46:22.020
But in name only until 1939,
the economic crisis,

739
00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:26.310
uh,
the,
the strike movement and all of that,
which in a way was counterproductive.

740
00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:30.690
And the war of Spain,
uh,
and the international situation,
uh,

741
00:46:30.691 --> 00:46:33.570
came to,
uh,
represent,
uh,

742
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:37.230
to bring about the defeat of this government.
And Leon Blum is most of,
you know,

743
00:46:37.231 --> 00:46:40.710
ends up in jail.
He's lucky.
A drink Vichy not to have been assassinated.

744
00:46:40.711 --> 00:46:45.630
He survives or not to get murdered or executed.
Uh,
he survives the war,
uh,

745
00:46:45.631 --> 00:46:49.860
and is active in politics again at the very beginning of what would become the

746
00:46:49.861 --> 00:46:52.560
fourth republic.
But we live in a world in the stall Shah,

747
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:56.490
and the historical nostalgia too.
And people,
you know,
people of my generation,

748
00:46:56.491 --> 00:47:01.080
I mean,
I wasn't born then,
I assure you that even near being born yet then,

749
00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:02.880
uh,
but we,
uh,
you know,

750
00:47:02.881 --> 00:47:07.800
we grew up listening to tales of Spain and arms for Spain.
And one,
you know,

751
00:47:07.801 --> 00:47:10.540
if one lives in France,
uh,
lots of the things that they're,

752
00:47:10.541 --> 00:47:11.950
they're good about France and,

753
00:47:11.951 --> 00:47:16.410
and the sort of the protective state in giving people the right to decent

754
00:47:16.411 --> 00:47:18.750
conditions,
uh,
the,
and decent,

755
00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:23.790
decent healthcare museums that are actually open and paid vacations are

756
00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:27.710
something that came out of that period.
And so one looks sort of backwards,

757
00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:28.920
a certain bit of nostalgia.

758
00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:34.490
So next Wednesday we will move on to the fall of France and to collaboration and

759
00:47:36.481 --> 00:47:37.080
World War II.
