1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:01.351
Well,

2
00:00:01.351 --> 00:00:02.101
I'm not working today.

3
00:00:02.101 --> 00:00:03.030
Why is your Shawn was with,

4
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:03.873
we should fail.

5
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:05.670
It's a great pleasure of my,

6
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.890
a wonderful colleague and great friend,

7
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:08.724
Bruno Gabon,

8
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.240
ah,

9
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.470
who is going to give the lecture today on the Great War grief and memory.

10
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.480
And he's the author of a really terrific book on called an English,

11
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.380
uh,

12
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.380
victory plunged into morning on what happened at the end of the war to the

13
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:26.550
soldiers and to France.

14
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:27.840
And he has just published,

15
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.590
I just received it a a few minutes ago that allow said delight,

16
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.150
wrong gap under his,

17
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:33.840
uh,

18
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.171
his,

19
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:34.291
uh,

20
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:35.120
editor ship,

21
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.320
uh,

along with,

23
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.240
uh,

24
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.680
any,

25
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.960
uh,

26
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.793
do may need.

27
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.370
Uh,

28
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.970
what else?

29
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:39.803
<v 1>Plus the</v>

30
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.303
Doula.

31
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.771
<v 2>Nice.</v>

32
00:00:50.771 --> 00:00:51.130
John,

33
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.460
this is my pleasure to give this class today on,

34
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.330
uh,

35
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.090
the Great War grief and memory.

36
00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.830
As a kind of introduction,

37
00:00:59.831 --> 00:01:04.831
I would like to start with a book as that Sigmund Freud wrote in 1915 photos for

38
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.350
the times on war and death.

39
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.331
And according to me,

40
00:01:10.331 --> 00:01:13.180
this is probably one of the most fascinating works,

41
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.330
original mass death and collective mourning in,

42
00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:16.800
uh,

43
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.510
in during the great whore for described.

44
00:01:19.511 --> 00:01:24.130
And they would like to quote the complete collapse when death has struck down

45
00:01:24.131 --> 00:01:25.330
someone we love,

46
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.060
a parent or partner in marriage,

47
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.400
a brother or a sister,

48
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.100
a child or close friend.

49
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.503
Her hopes,

50
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.403
he says,

51
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.410
the hopes or desires and our pleasures line the grave with them we will not

52
00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:42.700
become sold,

53
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.300
will not feel for lost once place.

54
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.020
Actually mass death and its consequence generalized morning appeared well before

55
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.540
the end of a war.

56
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.240
To give you only one example,

57
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.070
around 50% of a French soldiers killed during the great war,

58
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.490
lost their lives in 17 months periods between August,

59
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.920
1914 and disseminated 15 four years later in 1918 1919.

60
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.970
So in the immediate aftermath of war,

61
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.000
death was basically everywhere.

62
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.840
The names written on war memo oils built in the early 1920s.

63
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.700
The black dresses of the war,

64
00:02:27.701 --> 00:02:28.534
widows,

65
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.750
VMT spaces left by so many young men all over Europe and all over the world.

66
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.201
We all know,

67
00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:36.034
you all know,

68
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.370
uh,

69
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.220
from a demographic perspective how deadly.

70
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.670
The great war was around nine,

71
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.170
9 million Sadia skills.

72
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.850
2 million Germans,

73
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.860
1.8 million Russians,

74
00:02:47.861 --> 00:02:50.140
1.4 million French.

75
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.550
And to the debt of a great war,

76
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.150
one must also add all those killed by pretending to be other Spanish flu,

77
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
maybe two or three times more murderous than it will on probably 20 million

78
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:08.260
people were actually killed by the Spanish flu epidemic in 1918.

79
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.180
So we all move his fingers.

80
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.010
That's according to me.

81
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.040
They mean nothing if one does not consider them in their relationship with

82
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.110
privates and collective mourning.

83
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:22.180
And that's the topic of today's class.

84
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.410
Studying private and collective mourning is of course,

85
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.580
much more difficult than studying mass death from the perspective or historical

86
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:33.550
demography because most of the time,

87
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:34.090
uh,

88
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.811
vis personal,

89
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:35.710
very personal,

90
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.540
very intimate and family experience of mourning as left,

91
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:41.260
uh,

92
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.100
as not left many,

93
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.030
many sources.

94
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.420
So the challenge for the historians is actually to grasp the mourning process in

95
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:49.181
its reality.

96
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:54.181
Something equivalence to once the German sculptress get to call of it's dead.

97
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.530
When she made VIF to granite statues,

98
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.360
we presenting a husband,

99
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.080
Carl and urself mourning their song.

100
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.110
Peter was killed in Belgium and you have a city of EAP in October,

101
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.870
1914 of course he's talking to nuts captures historians are not artists

102
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.853
unfortunately.

103
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.260
So how do we study privates and collective mourning?

104
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.460
That's what,

105
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.250
that's what I will like to examine that if you in this class,

106
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.820
if the first part of my discussion or like to um,

107
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.970
I mean my perspective will be rather general if you have to buffer for war one

108
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.270
were the people in morning I will ask and how many of them were there.

109
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.250
But otherwise this question touches on the possibility of studying what Jay

110
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:50.410
winter once killed communities in morning,

111
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.110
a very full proper king concept that he's using mostly for Great Britain and for

112
00:04:56.111 --> 00:05:01.111
the u s if the second part of his class I will examine the specificity of

113
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:04.270
mourning in the aftermath of war one.

114
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.930
In doing so,

115
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.930
hope to show you that's morning can be studied from a competitive perspective

116
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.630
and that despite their personal emotional dimensions,

117
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.310
we'll bereavements after the great war actually have some characteristics in

118
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:21.970
common.

119
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:22.810
And lastly,

120
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.250
I will in my class because I mean even mourning process in itself and in doing

121
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:32.251
so I would like to study the relationship between personal suffering and

122
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:33.640
collective mourning.

123
00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:34.474
In other words,

124
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.620
the transformation of grief into a cultural process.

125
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.080
So let's start with my first point.

126
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.760
We're the persons in mourning after war one.

127
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.470
Well from the perspective of historical demography,

128
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.500
his question is actually a very difficult one wine because in France,

129
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.990
Eva Twenties and thirties well we doze remarriages last fair benefits and so

130
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:07.940
simply vanished from the statistics.

131
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.880
And if you take the case of the orphans,

132
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.990
they got some l from the French state when they were children,

133
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.650
that's not when they came of age.

134
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.281
Consequently,

135
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:24.281
the number of you'll find in most textbooks of around 600,000 windows and at

136
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:30.491
least 760,000 orphans in France in the 1920s is of course only a rough estimate.

137
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.080
And this is not to mention for grandparents,

138
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.070
the brothers,

139
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.300
the sisters,

140
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:39.560
the uncles,

141
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.680
the owns for nephews or cousins were in mourning too and sometimes expressed in

142
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:50.951
very moving diaries in very moving lecturers in very moving over sources,

143
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.190
their sufferings.

144
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.600
So we can set of communities in morning coined by Jay.

145
00:06:56.601 --> 00:07:01.601
Winter is a very useful one as a means to grasp the scale of morning after we

146
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.020
won in its entirety.

147
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.620
Actually every institution,

148
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:15.220
every social structure went into mourning in the aftermath of all won the

149
00:07:16.221 --> 00:07:17.150
franchise schools,

150
00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:18.160
the French Lycee,

151
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.360
the French universities,

152
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:21.890
the French companies,

153
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.420
the French businesses,

154
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.820
as well as let's say the French athletic clubs of the French football teams.

155
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:34.450
The debt might have the names inscribed in a number of places where schools were

156
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.290
former colleges,

157
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.960
their parish churches,

158
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.700
we social structures with themselves or communities in the morning.

159
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.890
We'll themselves composed of various groups affected by morning in varying

160
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:53.891
degrees depending on their relationship with the deceased when he was still

161
00:07:54.111 --> 00:07:54.890
alive.

162
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.090
And what's the second notion.

163
00:07:56.091 --> 00:08:00.390
But I would like actually to introduce what the French historian Stephan O'dwyer

164
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.910
whoso once called the circles in mourning for circles of morning.

165
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:09.911
The first circle for morning was composed of soldiers themselves for obvious

166
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:12.800
reasons.

167
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.840
On November 11th,

168
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.020
1918,

169
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:19.130
the French army was not only a victory swan,

170
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.800
but also an army in mourning.

171
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:26.360
Mourning for dad as much as rejoicing for victory.

172
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.170
What did the soldiers do on armistice day?

173
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.090
November 11th,

174
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:37.090
1918 the first tried to find the bodies of those.

175
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.310
What been abundance in fundamen slant.

176
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.740
They buried them and the decorated with flowers.

177
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.660
Um,

178
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:52.660
the wooden crosses like this one that's marked individual graves on the

179
00:08:53.361 --> 00:08:54.194
battlefields.

180
00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:00.860
I would need to quote the French you let or French [inaudible] sent to his wife

181
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.560
my regiment as suffered terrible losses.

182
00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:04.980
So it's,

183
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.900
it was written on Amish this day.

184
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:08.250
My Richmond,

185
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.200
I suffered terrible losses.

186
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:15.260
Many of my friends have been killed without ever knowing the joy of victory.

187
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.740
Thinking about those poor souls,

188
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.420
I feel terrible.

189
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.950
Those who are still waiting for news from members of their family,

190
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:27.360
we're still fighting.

191
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.500
Wanted first to be reassured before being able to rejoice.

192
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.840
Take the example of,

193
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:34.131
oh,

194
00:09:34.131 --> 00:09:35.100
he folkard you,

195
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.503
uh,

196
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:41.570
volunteered in the summer of 1914 at the age of 35 and was fascinating

197
00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:46.050
correspondence with his young fiance,

198
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:46.913
Madeline,

199
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.400
as been published just a few years ago.

200
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.500
Like Madeleine and I quote,

201
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:53.491
hi,

202
00:09:53.491 --> 00:09:53.790
I'm,

203
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:57.840
I am longing now to have some use of Carlo of [inaudible] erode.

204
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.530
I will not be completely happy until then.

205
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.960
And those were lost strands.

206
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:05.011
Those were lost.

207
00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:08.970
Brothers was with lost comrades in arms during the war,

208
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:14.060
often expressed what has been later diagnosed as the survivors syndrome.

209
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.860
The notion coins in the 1960s by Wiebe psychiatrist,

210
00:10:18.861 --> 00:10:23.460
yet the lands and he would like to quote here Briola Rochelle in is not for the

211
00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:23.811
committee.

212
00:10:23.811 --> 00:10:26.010
The shallow work published just after the war.

213
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.600
At certain moments,

214
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:33.260
I experienced a kind of shame as vo had tone for days I was enjoying now from

215
00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:39.450
those young men whom had left behind guilt,

216
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:40.913
shame,

217
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:42.300
anxiety,

218
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.553
sadness.

219
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:49.190
These were actually the feelings of most French solurs in November,

220
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:50.970
1918.

221
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.360
So that's the first circle of morning and sorry.

222
00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:58.320
And this first circle of mourning was actually in close contact with a second

223
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:02.130
circle of morning violative of where frank,

224
00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.390
where that comrades,

225
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.250
the soldiers as you may know,

226
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:10.600
use to inform the families of the precise location of the burial place,

227
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.010
including sometimes the photographs,

228
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.600
sometimes the man,

229
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.730
sometimes the description so that the body is could be filmed and rebury it

230
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:21.953
after the war.

231
00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.830
He described the debt soleus,

232
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:29.840
last moments he described the funeral tribute that had been made actually in

233
00:11:31.381 --> 00:11:32.280
doing so,

234
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.560
the first circle of mourning was small.

235
00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:39.561
Primary group worked as a kind of fictitious family substitute for the relatives

236
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:47.900
were not present when the soldier was killed and the second circle of mourning

237
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.580
was composed of a Saudi,

238
00:11:49.581 --> 00:11:50.311
his parents,

239
00:11:50.311 --> 00:11:51.180
the grandparents,

240
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.433
the children,

241
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:53.663
the wife,

242
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.840
and also a larger family group,

243
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.793
uncles,

244
00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:57.850
ounce,

245
00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:58.683
cousins,

246
00:11:59.080 --> 00:11:59.800
nieces,

247
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.633
nephews.

248
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:06.700
Most of the time I mess up meds if it's larger family group as being

249
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.760
underestimated because actually it appears in very rare sources and just with,

250
00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.060
you mentioned one of his very interesting sources.

251
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:19.640
That's the war diary written by the young foss was in my head.

252
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:20.830
You probably don't know her,

253
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:21.671
but you know,

254
00:12:21.671 --> 00:12:22.390
probably,

255
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:23.223
um,

256
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:23.540
uh,

257
00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:24.020
name,

258
00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:24.730
um,

259
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:28.360
when she will become one of the most famous child psychiatrist in France.

260
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:29.620
Foss was doled too.

261
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.720
So the young Francois has merit.

262
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.550
Uh,

263
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:37.390
I'd actually been indicated in a very Catholic family and she was brought up

264
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.600
with the idea that she should pray every day for her young uncle would have been

265
00:12:44.351 --> 00:12:45.184
sent to the front.

266
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.620
So she had been brought up with the idea,

267
00:12:47.621 --> 00:12:52.621
but in some ways it was her duty as a child.

268
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.330
And I will say as a young girl,

269
00:12:55.331 --> 00:12:59.350
which is not the same as a young girl to do so and,

270
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:04.060
but it was actually a way to take part in the conflict.

271
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.190
And as you can imagine,

272
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:11.670
the death of earlier uncle adds a traumatic impact in the life of this young

273
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.920
force was my head's in a diary.

274
00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:19.170
She repeats,

275
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:23.770
she presents herself come universe the gear as a war widow.

276
00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:28.300
And the grief is presented as a personal tragedy.

277
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.520
So that's a certain circle of money.

278
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:33.040
And you've got actually a third one,

279
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.860
which is of course much more difficult to study,

280
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.600
which is made up of friends.

281
00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.990
I don't know if you will be interested.

282
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.040
I think the story of friendship,

283
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:48.280
especially the story of friendship in war time is actually fascinating.

284
00:13:48.281 --> 00:13:50.650
One which still needs to be written.

285
00:13:50.651 --> 00:13:53.200
So if you have a senior essay to write about that,

286
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.610
it's a wonderful topic.

287
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:59.850
We sort of friendship in wartime and especially from the perspective of her

288
00:13:59.861 --> 00:14:01.240
history of bereavements.

289
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:07.200
It has been only partially study for small group of students in the English case

290
00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:12.910
for students from Oxford and Cambridge and in French case for students from

291
00:14:12.911 --> 00:14:17.911
[inaudible] who lost actually hundreds of friends during the war.

292
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:23.850
And we used to write shoulds but very personal biographies in vehicles yearbook.

293
00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:27.161
Take for example,

294
00:14:27.161 --> 00:14:29.830
this arbitrary written by the novelist movies.

295
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:31.240
While you most probably know him,

296
00:14:31.241 --> 00:14:36.160
he's one of the most famous writers of the Great War.

297
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:37.180
Um,

298
00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:41.620
so it was written by the novelist movies who refer one of his friends killed at

299
00:14:41.621 --> 00:14:44.920
the age of 25 in January,

300
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:44.921
2015.

301
00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:45.754
And I quote,

302
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:52.020
what felt often during those long months of war and each engagement had created

303
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.660
voids around me,

304
00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.540
all the good friends at the beginning.

305
00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:00.531
Uhm,

306
00:15:00.531 --> 00:15:05.531
I chosen what lightens my horse and to whom I wanted to give back.

307
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:12.100
The strength we have given me had fallen one after the one,

308
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:18.040
all of them until I was alone in a crowed of indifference men.

309
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:25.300
And among those whose support I wished for to make the skills of a debt were

310
00:15:26.481 --> 00:15:27.314
fervent,

311
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:32.270
was been wa dearest to my heart and most valued friends.

312
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:34.010
I said to myself,

313
00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.100
he at least will be saved.

314
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.510
And I believed it.

315
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.870
Then one morning in the white hospital room,

316
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:45.110
the mail orderly handed me a card.

317
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:50.590
And on this card I read butwhat is that I felt a crushing sorrow.

318
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.410
I could not understand it.

319
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.810
It did not make sense.

320
00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:02.650
Well of course we substance of meaning bs absurdity can be explained by the

321
00:16:03.591 --> 00:16:04.910
experience of war itself.

322
00:16:04.911 --> 00:16:09.911
But it also leads us to the second point I would like to discuss with you today

323
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:15.790
the specificity if there is any of the experience of one the first specificity

324
00:16:16.791 --> 00:16:17.560
according to me,

325
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:22.560
but for the first time death in combat reversed the normal succession of

326
00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:29.651
generations are not on a limited scale rubber on the scale of a wound

327
00:16:30.851 --> 00:16:31.684
generation,

328
00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:32.640
lead generation pages,

329
00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:33.560
the lost generation,

330
00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.560
they were often feelings of shame,

331
00:16:36.561 --> 00:16:41.561
feelings of guilt towards the younger men were almost exclusively bearing the

332
00:16:41.871 --> 00:16:44.060
burden of war and death.

333
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.810
As my colleague Jay Winter pointed out in a thought provoking article on wartime

334
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:52.340
demography published some years ago,

335
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
many older people in Paris and London and Berlin were suffering from depression

336
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:01.370
during the great war.

337
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:05.270
And you've got the very famous case of the sociologist.

338
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.290
It need Ukiah w died of grief.

339
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:14.390
It died of grief only one year after his son's death in December,

340
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:20.140
1915 so the reverse of the normal succession of generations was seen as

341
00:17:20.271 --> 00:17:21.104
shocking,

342
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.640
not only during the war,

343
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.550
not only in the immediate aftermath of war,

344
00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:27.080
but also years later.

345
00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:31.550
And I like to cook an amazing page from the last novel.

346
00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.230
You probably know it.

347
00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:33.591
It's,

348
00:17:33.591 --> 00:17:37.760
it's one of the probably one of the most wonderful books written by Ldl Commute.

349
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:38.800
Uh,

350
00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.411
Republic harm,

351
00:17:39.411 --> 00:17:40.250
the first man,

352
00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:41.271
a copy of which,

353
00:17:41.271 --> 00:17:41.991
as you may know,

354
00:17:41.991 --> 00:17:46.991
we'll stones in briefcase near the car in which the novel died in January,

355
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:52.350
1960 at the age 46 in 1950 free.

356
00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:57.880
Albert made a pilgrimage to the cemetery in Brittany where his father,

357
00:17:59.650 --> 00:17:59.830
uh,

358
00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:00.960
lay it,

359
00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:05.810
filmed the grave in the first row of the military section of a Sami share

360
00:18:05.811 --> 00:18:06.730
cemetery at somebody,

361
00:18:06.731 --> 00:18:08.520
you and there,

362
00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.330
you read the date and I quote 1885,

363
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:17.390
1914 and automatically it did very frantic.

364
00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.500
1929 years.

365
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:25.040
Suddenly it was truck by an idea of at shook his very being.

366
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.330
It was 40 years old.

367
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:30.300
The man buried under that slab,

368
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:35.630
what being his father was actually younger than he and the wave of tenderness

369
00:18:37.291 --> 00:18:42.291
and PT that once filled his heart was not the steering of a soul that leads the

370
00:18:43.231 --> 00:18:45.780
song to the memory of a vanished forever.

371
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:51.680
But the overwhelming compassion that's a grown man feels for an unjustly

372
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.430
murdered child.

373
00:18:53.431 --> 00:18:56.940
Something here was not in the natural order.

374
00:18:56.941 --> 00:18:57.780
And in truth,

375
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.370
there was no order,

376
00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:04.371
but only madness and chaos when the son was older and the father second

377
00:19:06.871 --> 00:19:11.871
specificity death was also experienced by the soldiers in a very solitary way.

378
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.673
Well,

379
00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.050
it will tell me it's,

380
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.950
it's of course very common in what time.

381
00:19:16.951 --> 00:19:21.951
But here it must be seen specifically in the light of both extreme violence of

382
00:19:24.001 --> 00:19:28.080
the first world war and in the light of the religious rituals.

383
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:30.300
But we're still very important in France,

384
00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:30.840
uh,

385
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.430
before the outbreak of world war,

386
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:38.270
one of the most striking fears experienced by the soldiers of the Great War was

387
00:19:38.971 --> 00:19:43.971
of dying alone in the midst of a no man's land abundance by their comrades.

388
00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:50.180
Because of the violence of a battle without a truce for a stretcher bearers or

389
00:19:52.921 --> 00:19:53.460
because,

390
00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.480
because the,

391
00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:59.570
the shorts and official truces where too precarious solurs who fell wounded

392
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:04.440
between the lines lay dying for hours sometimes days.

393
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.730
According to the military historian John Keegan,

394
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:14.130
one third of the 20,000 men would died on the Somme.

395
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:19.610
On July the first 1916 might have been saved at the wounded soldiers being added

396
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.930
as we probably would have been half a century earlier.

397
00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:30.820
So with fear of dying alone was something many relatives actually imagined for

398
00:20:31.921 --> 00:20:36.280
the loved ones and which added of course another tournaments to Verbier

399
00:20:36.281 --> 00:20:37.114
easements,

400
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.880
imagining their loved ones dying in an almost animal solitude was something.

401
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:42.863
And they're able,

402
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:46.260
and I would like to quote a war diary published 19,

403
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.200
19.

404
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:47.980
What we do,

405
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.980
he dies old alone over there like a dog and this horrible,

406
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:57.670
beautiful death we call death on the field of hunter.

407
00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:02.470
He will lie for days and days forgotten on the bare earth.

408
00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:07.980
We were smash skill and chest and German crows will steal away.

409
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:09.880
He's dearest memories.

410
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:15.660
Obviously we saw Richard death was over more and variable as dying was not the

411
00:21:16.841 --> 00:21:21.841
socially invisible reality it has become in the late 20th century.

412
00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.190
But something accepted,

413
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:26.920
something experienced at home.

414
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.310
It a company of ladies and friends.

415
00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:31.330
And,

416
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:31.690
uh,

417
00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:33.370
if you want to understand this process,

418
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.240
um,

419
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.710
you have to read the work by Slg snobbery alias,

420
00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:39.243
which is probably,

421
00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:39.940
uh,

422
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:43.510
his last book published in 1982.

423
00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:47.860
The loneliness of dying in which he presents his process from,

424
00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:48.881
you know,

425
00:21:48.881 --> 00:21:53.881
once again the death experience at term to a kind of invisible solitary death we

426
00:21:54.941 --> 00:21:57.070
experienced right now in it today.

427
00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.630
So before one,

428
00:21:59.020 --> 00:21:59.530
uh,

429
00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:00.281
only votes,

430
00:22:00.281 --> 00:22:04.720
what's new family on if those were new home will die alone or will die in the

431
00:22:04.721 --> 00:22:05.554
hospital.

432
00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:06.670
Um,

433
00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:07.450
the funeral,

434
00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:11.280
the funeral vigil was also very important and uh,

435
00:22:11.281 --> 00:22:15.040
and a very respected ritual in a Catholic country like France,

436
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:20.970
industrialized warfare where one change this tradition in the most violence in

437
00:22:21.761 --> 00:22:23.230
the most brutal way,

438
00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.850
all the stages.

439
00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.050
And they are very important.

440
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.310
All the stages,

441
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:28.540
the stages by,

442
00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:33.780
but used to prepare a person for bereavement was simply eliminated all the

443
00:22:36.821 --> 00:22:40.930
rituals in ordinary life accompanied with first moments of floss.

444
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.490
We're also eliminated.

445
00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:48.450
The first specificity was the absence of for dead bodies during World War One

446
00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.110
and that for,

447
00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:54.010
um,

448
00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:55.480
two main reasons.

449
00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:01.500
The first one was the complete destruction of around 30% of those killed during

450
00:23:05.531 --> 00:23:10.531
the great war whose bodies were destroyed by the explosions and could not be

451
00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.480
identified in the context of total war.

452
00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:21.840
Direc direct heats from large caliber shells cools,

453
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:28.080
literally pulverize the body living absolutely no remains.

454
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:33.910
Hence the green number of missing in action during the Great War.

455
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.000
If you want to understand the expense of shelling,

456
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:43.040
and if you want to explore to understand the psychological sufferings inflicted

457
00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:43.893
the soldiers,

458
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:46.370
you must read what the Jesuits,

459
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:51.500
but you Bleuler a veteran of our don Rhodes about the battle of [inaudible] in

460
00:23:51.801 --> 00:23:53.150
1916 and I quote,

461
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.560
when one heard the whistle in for distance,

462
00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:03.490
once we'll body contracted to resist the two excessively potent vibrations of

463
00:24:06.171 --> 00:24:07.004
the explosion.

464
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:11.930
And at each repetition it was a new attack in new fatigue,

465
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.160
a new suffering,

466
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:15.350
and the rest regime,

467
00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:19.040
the most solid nerves cannot resist for long.

468
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:23.450
Perhaps the best comparison is that of seasickness.

469
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.700
And that's my point to die from bullets seems to be nothing,

470
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:30.580
parts of uh,

471
00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:32.470
being remained in tact,

472
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:34.550
but to be dismembered,

473
00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.320
torn to pieces,

474
00:24:36.321 --> 00:24:37.250
reduced to perturb.

475
00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:42.660
This is a fear that flesh cannot support and which is fundamentally the great

476
00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:47.570
suffering of the bombardments.

477
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:53.210
But there is also under reason for the absence of dead bodies,

478
00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.130
which is often less known.

479
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:57.800
After 1918,

480
00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:03.460
the bodies remained on the battlefields until the French government's gave

481
00:25:05.121 --> 00:25:07.610
permission to repatriate them.

482
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:12.640
But this dinner to happen before a special decree was passed in 1922 years after

483
00:25:15.651 --> 00:25:16.484
the end of a one.

484
00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:22.540
Why did it take some time to allow the French families to get their loved one's

485
00:25:23.921 --> 00:25:26.420
body is back home for private burial.

486
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:27.440
Nobody knows.

487
00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:32.770
But if the enormous amount of energy many French families spend to have his

488
00:25:33.891 --> 00:25:35.420
decree finally signed,

489
00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.160
shows in itself,

490
00:25:37.161 --> 00:25:42.161
the psychological sufferings coast by distance and punch absence.

491
00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:44.210
Well,

492
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.340
but something we all know from everyday life.

493
00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:47.061
For example,

494
00:25:47.061 --> 00:25:52.061
in the case of the sailors lost at sea or from recent events,

495
00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:53.391
for example,

496
00:25:53.391 --> 00:25:58.391
the victims of the nine 11 attacks ending the mourning process without having

497
00:26:01.101 --> 00:26:05.430
seen touched or keystone birds.

498
00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:10.490
A body is extremely difficult and most impossible and that's actually something

499
00:26:11.421 --> 00:26:16.190
far dozens and thousands of families experienced afterward one,

500
00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:21.660
but it's also something the French politician Luba to explain before the

501
00:26:21.801 --> 00:26:26.801
national commission on military burials on May 31st,

502
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.750
1919 when the government,

503
00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:33.440
French government still post the return of the Sardius remains and I quote,

504
00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:34.813
fine,

505
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:36.950
it's all very well to say,

506
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.130
but our children will be equal in death,

507
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:45.850
but I don't see what principle of equality requires that a hard and fast rule be

508
00:26:47.461 --> 00:26:51.510
established as far as feminism as concerns various,

509
00:26:51.511 --> 00:26:55.620
my son was killed in 1914 five years ago,

510
00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:57.260
is in a tomb.

511
00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:02.870
His mother and I are waiting for him and because hovers,

512
00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.620
I've not been filmed.

513
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:10.080
You tell me what you forbidden me to take my son and bring him to the Pella

514
00:27:10.081 --> 00:27:10.740
share cemetery,

515
00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:11.340
which is,

516
00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:11.791
as you may know,

517
00:27:11.791 --> 00:27:14.610
one of the largest cemeteries in Paris.

518
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:18.480
Well I tell you that you have no rights to do so.

519
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:23.490
You explain it by seeing that hundreds of thousands of Saudis I've been killed

520
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.040
and you have not identified them,

521
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:30.120
but mine was you speak of identification.

522
00:27:30.121 --> 00:27:35.121
Well mine was identify of the transportation shortage but I can bring back my

523
00:27:36.331 --> 00:27:40.720
son on my own without asking anything of governments.

524
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:46.110
This is not what I understand by quality and I think the proposed government

525
00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:51.831
bill is a mistake but swipe I for my part won't accept it

526
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:58.520
as a consequence of the is specificities I've just presented.

527
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:05.120
The mourning process after one was an incredibly difficult and torturous Swann

528
00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:12.810
and gave birth to a new commemorative activity,

529
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:14.580
new languages,

530
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:20.570
new rituals that I would like to present now in my first point up to now I've

531
00:28:22.711 --> 00:28:27.711
addressed the notion of grief from the perspective of a personal Verafin's but

532
00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.713
the expense of dust,

533
00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.151
death,

534
00:28:31.151 --> 00:28:32.970
the absence of so many dead bodies.

535
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:38.750
The violence of the war experience itself also needed new forms of

536
00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:44.810
representation so that the dead soldiers could be remembered and [inaudible]

537
00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.220
attribute could be bad to them.

538
00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:51.180
That's what a stiff and underwent Rizzo and,

539
00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:52.230
and it be care.

540
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:53.700
Explain in the book,

541
00:28:53.701 --> 00:28:54.720
1914,

542
00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:56.100
1918,

543
00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:56.660
uh,

544
00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:58.020
understanding of the Great War,

545
00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:03.410
the words spoken at ceremonies the majors offered in inscriptions and

546
00:29:05.221 --> 00:29:06.480
commemorative monuments,

547
00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:09.200
the stained glass window,

548
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:10.063
cemeteries,

549
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:11.560
an ulcer is,

550
00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:13.680
I've lasted to this day.

551
00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:18.800
And through them we as historians can recall this endless commemorations where

552
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:27.020
political liturgy and private bereavements we're complimentary political liturgy

553
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:29.840
and private bereavements.

554
00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:30.683
In other words,

555
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:33.600
collective mourning and personal grief.

556
00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:39.480
My point here is not present to present you of course the wool of commemorative

557
00:29:39.481 --> 00:29:40.650
activity after all one,

558
00:29:40.651 --> 00:29:41.484
but we'll be,

559
00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:43.810
unless impossible and use this.

560
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:48.790
I would prefer to focus on two major cultural processes,

561
00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:49.280
but you,

562
00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:53.500
we have a transformation of the personal grief into collective mourning.

563
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:59.100
The first one can be presented as a kind of a nationalization of mourning.

564
00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:06.940
In the 1920s and 1930s,

565
00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:13.020
the battlefields were converted into a commemorative sites through a network of

566
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:18.940
military cemeteries,

567
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:24.750
landscaped memorial parks and a large Butterfield moments.

568
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:31.710
It kind of water risen appeared during the conflict itself and develops in

569
00:30:34.271 --> 00:30:35.850
Veneto and 20s and 90.

570
00:30:35.851 --> 00:30:36.684
Third is,

571
00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:37.750
uh,

572
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:39.910
just with Julia for if you're interested by that topic,

573
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.333
to Veeam,

574
00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.320
to the book written by a David Lloyd,

575
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:49.180
a battlefield tourism pilgrimage at the commemoration of a great war in Britain,

576
00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.890
Australia and Canada,

577
00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:51.160
uh,

578
00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.870
published in 1998.

579
00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.480
This new sites of memory,

580
00:30:55.780 --> 00:31:00.610
or to use the famous terminology coined by Piano Ha Wisnu [inaudible] memoir,

581
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.940
we're often represented on objects,

582
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.970
paintings and pictures.

583
00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:10.750
And a number of ceremonies were organized via to pay tribute to the dead,

584
00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.210
especially on armistice day each year.

585
00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:16.070
And that's an object which I liked very much.

586
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.360
I mean,

587
00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.470
it's a bit catch of course.

588
00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:18.190
Uh,

589
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:20.990
but it's the also re,

590
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:22.110
uh,

591
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.960
in [inaudible].

592
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:24.720
So Nia Verda in Vietnam,

593
00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:25.780
uh,

594
00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.430
which is represented on a tray.

595
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.900
Can you imagine that to advance the term of the time anyway?

596
00:31:30.901 --> 00:31:31.810
It's on entree,

597
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:32.591
uh,

598
00:31:32.591 --> 00:31:33.250
and,

599
00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:34.083
um,

600
00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:34.740
you,

601
00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.340
you see exactly what's what,

602
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:37.380
what's Demo,

603
00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:37.870
uh,

604
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:38.290
Isabella,

605
00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:38.560
I mean it's,

606
00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:38.891
it's,

607
00:31:38.891 --> 00:31:39.880
it's huge.

608
00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:40.810
Necropolis,

609
00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:42.070
um,

610
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:46.420
which was integrated in a summer 1932.

611
00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:47.411
Uh,

612
00:31:47.411 --> 00:31:52.411
it's a most at the same time to bring together most of the identifying but is of

613
00:31:54.551 --> 00:31:57.100
a battle of symmetry here,

614
00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:01.420
contains more than 15,000 buyers.

615
00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:07.530
And the other aim was to contain the remains of those who remained unidentified

616
00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.300
estimating them.

617
00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:15.300
But here estimated 32,000 inside of the building,

618
00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:18.510
32,000 Soviet Jewry,

619
00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:19.391
uh,

620
00:32:19.391 --> 00:32:20.040
which,

621
00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:20.240
uh,

622
00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:25.150
appears also in the famous 1937 remake of Jacuzzis,

623
00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:26.110
uh,

624
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:29.820
by other algos where that third years here,

625
00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:34.840
the symmetry rise from Motiva to rise from the grave in Duomo,

626
00:32:35.651 --> 00:32:38.060
the Duomo cemetery to homes,

627
00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:38.590
uh,

628
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:40.610
the living and prevent another war.

629
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:40.950
That's,

630
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:43.580
that's a fascinating film.

631
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.470
So,

632
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.960
um,

633
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:49.960
the author release Australia have dual moon and free of it once at [inaudible],

634
00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:52.360
at Domo,

635
00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.253
Vermont,

636
00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:55.070
and at a Artman villa,

637
00:32:55.071 --> 00:32:58.580
cops in the Alsace became places of,

638
00:32:58.750 --> 00:32:59.060
uh,

639
00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.440
family pilgrimage for those.

640
00:33:01.441 --> 00:33:03.510
What's lost related or for those,

641
00:33:03.511 --> 00:33:04.850
what's a new grave to go to?

642
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:06.590
According to me,

643
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:12.190
all this commemorative sites of memory must be considered in the perspective of

644
00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.150
the French national unity,

645
00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.490
the sites of memory,

646
00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:24.350
which became sort of mourning for the wool French nation in this one demo.

647
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:30.130
And also the 36,000 war memorials built in each of the 36,000 commune into which

648
00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:39.260
France was divided in every French coming.

649
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:42.110
So even if the very smallest village,

650
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:44.630
the same day of the year,

651
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:48.320
November 11th at the same hour,

652
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:53.830
11:00 AM the mirror used to name the debt for the lost generation,

653
00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:02.900
a new entity was created but obeyed the classical precepts of tragedy,

654
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:06.320
unity of time,

655
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:08.120
November 11th,

656
00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:09.890
unity of space,

657
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:11.390
war memorials,

658
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:12.950
unity of action,

659
00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:18.640
the commemorative ceremony naming the dads serves.

660
00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.060
As you can imagine,

661
00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:25.120
another important function for the living inscribing the names of the debt,

662
00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:31.300
reading them and then touching Vince corruption served to bring the dead out of

663
00:34:34.641 --> 00:34:36.410
the anonymity of mass death.

664
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:38.210
And if you've been to,

665
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:39.063
uh,

666
00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:39.291
uh,

667
00:34:39.291 --> 00:34:40.400
Washington DC,

668
00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:44.990
you know that it's exactly what happens nowadays with the Vm,

669
00:34:44.991 --> 00:34:49.991
with the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington DC main by my Alene where the

670
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:55.670
Vietnam vet school to touch inscriptions and more than that,

671
00:34:55.671 --> 00:34:58.070
comrades in arms we over,

672
00:34:58.071 --> 00:34:58.904
you'd be more,

673
00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:04.160
if you have a site of memory related to this nationalization of mourning is of

674
00:35:04.461 --> 00:35:09.461
course the commemorative invention by excellence of the great war,

675
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:14.770
the cult of your non Saudi in most countries except Germany.

676
00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:16.573
And uh,

677
00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:17.413
except Russia.

678
00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:22.700
The kilt of your non Satya was extremely popular in the 1920s.

679
00:35:22.701 --> 00:35:27.320
It appeared and must have the same time in Paris and London in 1920 in

680
00:35:27.321 --> 00:35:27.831
Washington,

681
00:35:27.831 --> 00:35:32.831
d c Rome and Brussels in 1921 and in Prague undergrads in 1922.

682
00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.120
But of course,

683
00:35:35.121 --> 00:35:37.100
I would like to focus on the French case.

684
00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:42.890
What's happens in other managing 20 on November 10th,

685
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:48.140
1920 [inaudible] via known Sardius coffin arrived in Paris by special train from

686
00:35:48.781 --> 00:35:49.614
Vietnam.

687
00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:55.230
The coffin was placed for one night and every step is important.

688
00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:58.380
The coffin was placed for one night at the plus.

689
00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.640
Don't fair Horschel,

690
00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:00.870
which is of course symbolic.

691
00:36:00.871 --> 00:36:01.160
And you,

692
00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:01.651
you know,

693
00:36:01.651 --> 00:36:02.520
probably why?

694
00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:07.850
Because it was named for [inaudible] was named for Herrick French commander of

695
00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:14.210
1871 and so it's symbolized the revenge of the French have over Germans.

696
00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.210
The next day,

697
00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.400
November 11th,

698
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:24.330
1920 [inaudible] Sadia was broach to the podium,

699
00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:29.820
which was first considered for national place to bury it because as you may

700
00:36:29.821 --> 00:36:30.450
know,

701
00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:33.030
it's the burial place dedicated to the nations.

702
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:33.893
Great man.

703
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.120
But according to most veterans,

704
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:39.440
the unknown Sadia was not I going on.

705
00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:40.890
Tom was not a great man,

706
00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:42.270
if usual meaning of a word.

707
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:46.920
So after a brief ceremony at the pointy on the coffin was brought to the

708
00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.033
accurate [inaudible],

709
00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:54.140
it had been drafts with the French flag had been placed on a gun courage,

710
00:36:56.610 --> 00:37:01.610
and it was surrounded by mutilated veterans were there to symbolize the

711
00:37:02.821 --> 00:37:05.490
destroyed man and we'll destroy families.

712
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:07.050
Furthermore,

713
00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:08.220
and this is my point,

714
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.900
the coffin was also accompanied by a fictitious family,

715
00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:15.000
a war widow,

716
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.760
a mother and father.

717
00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.150
What lost a song and a child,

718
00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.520
what lost his father during the war.

719
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:27.690
This as if each Frenchman,

720
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.780
each French woman was too doped,

721
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:36.500
Vietnam [inaudible] as a member of ease or earth family and the ceremonies of

722
00:37:38.641 --> 00:37:40.080
November 11th,

723
00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:45.060
1920 brought hundreds of thousands of weeping people and to the streets of

724
00:37:45.061 --> 00:37:45.870
Paris.

725
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:50.870
Many and courage to believe that the coffin but past actually before them

726
00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:54.540
contained the body of a man got lost.

727
00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.153
In other words,

728
00:37:56.370 --> 00:38:01.370
if you're non Satya was the debt relative of every French family as well as the

729
00:38:02.031 --> 00:38:06.640
symbol of the loss experienced by the French nation as well.

730
00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:11.190
So that's also a kind of nationalization of morning nationalization of morning.

731
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:16.430
But also this is the second major cultural process.

732
00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.310
It kind of spiritualization of morning,

733
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:21.891
well,

734
00:38:21.891 --> 00:38:26.891
I'll call you many examples of the spiritual favor that characterized for 1920

735
00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:28.890
and 1930s.

736
00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:30.421
I call look,

737
00:38:30.421 --> 00:38:33.750
so discuss as Jay winter,

738
00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:34.410
uh,

739
00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:36.050
deeds remarkably in his book,

740
00:38:36.051 --> 00:38:36.791
sites of memory,

741
00:38:36.791 --> 00:38:37.540
sites of morning,

742
00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:42.540
wherever the spirituality of the great war and of the aftermath of war,

743
00:38:43.131 --> 00:38:43.580
great war,

744
00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.400
something new or something,

745
00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:48.480
a rooted in the European register.

746
00:38:48.481 --> 00:38:53.481
Traditions and rituals only give you one emblematic example.

747
00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.710
And actually I will end my presentation with beds.

748
00:38:57.490 --> 00:39:02.080
This is a case of Marie Scully gots a portrait here.

749
00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:03.663
Um,

750
00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:08.850
a young officer cadets who died in Boucher van on the Somme on September the

751
00:39:10.721 --> 00:39:11.411
25th,

752
00:39:11.411 --> 00:39:16.180
1916 at the age of 22 actually,

753
00:39:16.181 --> 00:39:19.170
it was sent on a record sauce,

754
00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:19.450
uh,

755
00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:20.283
mission.

756
00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:22.210
And as it was just back from leave,

757
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:26.140
he probably didn't know the area very well and lost his way.

758
00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:30.490
And he was shot by a German Petrol Morris.

759
00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:31.160
Uh,

760
00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:36.160
also the only child of bets and [inaudible] owns a factory in cane that's in the

761
00:39:39.791 --> 00:39:44.791
department or the was close to Paris fettuccine methods for 50 kilometers from

762
00:39:46.091 --> 00:39:46.924
Paris.

763
00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:49.280
It was a marriage and only a few,

764
00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:50.440
a few relaters.

765
00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:53.800
His immediate family included Polis seven people.

766
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:59.550
And His death was of course experienced as a terrible emotional shock for all of

767
00:40:00.311 --> 00:40:01.144
them.

768
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:06.510
Actually took almost six months before Morris galleys.

769
00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:11.590
Parents received the confirmation that their son had been killed.

770
00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:16.000
It was first considered missing in action and his body was identified only

771
00:40:16.001 --> 00:40:17.560
spring 1917.

772
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:20.460
Becht Annmarie belts on.

773
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:25.470
And [inaudible] could not wait until the end of a war to see the place where

774
00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:28.780
their son Morris was buried,

775
00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:30.970
despite the obvious danger,

776
00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.750
despite the restrictions imposed by the military authorities.

777
00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.660
The drove to Bush ban in 1917.

778
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:39.400
Can you imagine that in 1917,

779
00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.890
the drove to Boucher van as soon as we could.

780
00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:47.490
And we took pictures of the temporary grave in 1922,

781
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:52.010
almost four years after VM is stairs,

782
00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:56.020
but decided to Barry Morris for a second time.

783
00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:01.700
[inaudible] his father wrote to the mayor of which oven and convinced him to

784
00:41:02.651 --> 00:41:07.651
build a huge road site cross dedicated to the memory of a men of Boucher van and

785
00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:12.640
dedicated to Morris himself.

786
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:14.410
So as you can see,

787
00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:15.790
uh,

788
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:16.840
at this stage,

789
00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:21.930
the personal grief is already deeply intertwined with the public collective one.

790
00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:24.850
In 1922,

791
00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:29.860
Beth Galle decided also to transform Morris's room,

792
00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:31.840
um,

793
00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:35.810
into a kind of off a mausoleum,

794
00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:40.190
some grounds from the battlefield,

795
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:41.503
uh,

796
00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:46.540
from the song was wrote back to Kay and exposed in a room along with,

797
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:50.630
I don't know if you can see that here.

798
00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:51.770
Clearly we've,

799
00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:52.490
uh,

800
00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:57.490
fragments of showers and over material souvenir of the great war behind,

801
00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:00.100
uh,

802
00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:05.100
for cabinets window Molise Skelly's uniform with the Ruby red pants of 1914.

803
00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:09.870
Some photographs here representing,

804
00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:10.640
uh,

805
00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:11.473
the young man,

806
00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:16.740
so curious gathering of personal belongings and remains from the war,

807
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:22.640
which reveal according to me kind of finishes him,

808
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:28.600
but that's not all in this room transformed into a kind of chapel.

809
00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.580
Morris was represented,

810
00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:32.540
uh,

811
00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:36.440
like a saint w at safety France.

812
00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.950
And as his own grandmother wrote in a prayer,

813
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.590
the will universally,

814
00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.171
they have to talk to you,

815
00:42:42.171 --> 00:42:42.890
not only France,

816
00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:47.890
you need to have to Dante Maurice's personal belongings were described Babette

817
00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:49.450
by Beth [inaudible].

818
00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:49.940
Uh,

819
00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:53.870
his mother as some religious reliefs.

820
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:57.050
And this is actually what's many,

821
00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:02.680
many Catholic French people throat either twenties and thirties.

822
00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:03.770
At this time.

823
00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:04.993
As um,

824
00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:06.020
uh,

825
00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:06.853
my colleague,

826
00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:07.810
uh,

827
00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:09.740
and because explaining it was one of a,

828
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.891
uh,

829
00:43:09.891 --> 00:43:10.520
books,

830
00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:10.880
uh,

831
00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:11.810
the Christian soldier,

832
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:12.680
uh,

833
00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:17.680
was lichens and his sacrifice to Christ in a kind of image ostial Christie and

834
00:43:20.301 --> 00:43:22.520
his mother to New Virgin Mary and Mattel,

835
00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:27.380
Mattel de la Rosa until a death in 1927.

836
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:33.130
Morris galleys over went every day to the room and we cited the prayer shut

837
00:43:35.781 --> 00:43:36.890
composed for him,

838
00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.020
thanking God for having given,

839
00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:39.650
uh,

840
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:43.220
such a courageous grandson buskers of who we are,

841
00:43:43.221 --> 00:43:45.020
the [inaudible] of the [inaudible] propelled him.

842
00:43:45.021 --> 00:43:46.020
Or if we're able to,

843
00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:46.850
paddy,

844
00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:51.580
usually machine comas like a sane [inaudible] senior.

845
00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.330
The prayer saves at the end.

846
00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:55.483
Well,

847
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:56.450
when deeds,

848
00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:01.660
the mourning process ends is the war of 1914,

849
00:44:01.701 --> 00:44:06.701
1918 over as many photos in the early 1990s,

850
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:08.990
after the fourth of,

851
00:44:08.991 --> 00:44:09.321
of,

852
00:44:09.321 --> 00:44:09.640
of,

853
00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:09.840
uh,

854
00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:10.910
will of billing.

855
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:14.180
Paradoxically in the last few years,

856
00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:18.890
we have witnessed a new emotional investment in the conflict,

857
00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.500
the first and the fourth generation,

858
00:44:21.501 --> 00:44:23.600
but generations of the veterans,

859
00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:24.763
grandchildren,

860
00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:26.260
or great grandchildren.

861
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:26.811
My generation,

862
00:44:26.811 --> 00:44:28.720
the new generation are more,

863
00:44:28.721 --> 00:44:29.240
most,

864
00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:33.420
more and more aware of importance of war in the story of the 20th century.

865
00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:38.520
And the first World War tends to be evermore present in the minds of successive

866
00:44:38.521 --> 00:44:39.354
generations,

867
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.810
according to mostly historians and accordingly,

868
00:44:41.811 --> 00:44:43.330
especially too stiff and [inaudible].

869
00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:49.280
We see a huge interest in the 1990s is related to the unfinished process of

870
00:44:52.201 --> 00:44:53.034
mourning

871
00:44:55.170 --> 00:45:00.170
and actually explains that by the number of mini missing in action in a one at

872
00:45:01.201 --> 00:45:02.760
the end of 1920s,

873
00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:07.850
after the death of Maurice's father Beth Galley decided to transform the house,

874
00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:14.370
a service it could be transforming to a kind of museum.

875
00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:16.440
So she was living in,

876
00:45:16.441 --> 00:45:16.981
she moved,

877
00:45:16.981 --> 00:45:17.271
she was,

878
00:45:17.271 --> 00:45:17.971
she lived in,

879
00:45:17.971 --> 00:45:18.241
in,

880
00:45:18.241 --> 00:45:18.541
in,

881
00:45:18.541 --> 00:45:19.290
in the,

882
00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:19.800
uh,

883
00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.120
in a small house.

884
00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:22.230
Just opposite,

885
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:22.921
uh,

886
00:45:22.921 --> 00:45:26.520
what has become the Musee [inaudible] founded in the 1930s.

887
00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:28.800
And she died in 1956.

888
00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:34.620
Was this transformation of the house into a museum,

889
00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:39.680
a way for her to show that the mourning process was over on the country.

890
00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:46.440
Was it a way to prune the mourning process internally anyway,

891
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:48.570
after so many years,

892
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:54.230
Marissa's room remains unchanged as a kind of private chapel in a public museum.

893
00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:57.150
Thanks.
