1
00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:02.470
Oh,

2
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.930
today I want to talk about large scale industrialization and um,

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.801
and,

4
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:08.730
and workers.

5
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:09.810
Um,

6
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.160
let me say a couple things,

7
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.050
a couple of general points,

8
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.413
um,

9
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.780
that are important.

10
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.160
I is that,

11
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.790
uh,

12
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.780
two things at the beginning,

13
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.340
first of all,

14
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.270
everywhere and particularly in the case of France,

15
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.291
uh,

16
00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:30.270
the industrial revolution was first and foremost a continuation of forms of

17
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:32.430
production that were already there.

18
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.540
That we've overemphasized the kind of technological advances,

19
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:39.690
the super inventions of the 18th century in the textile industry.

20
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.441
Uh,

21
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:41.274
and that,

22
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.461
uh,

23
00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:42.120
even in,

24
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.160
even in in Britain and some of you heard,

25
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.950
we have heard me say this in the context of another course,

26
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.310
a traditional ways of producing things artisinal and domestic industry involving

27
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:53.394
women,

28
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.150
uh,

29
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.410
doing out work or,

30
00:00:55.411 --> 00:00:58.650
or a domestic industry was essential to the process.

31
00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.370
Uh,

32
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.440
the second industrial revolution really,

33
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.750
uh,

34
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.880
it depends on when you want to,

35
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.571
uh,

36
00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:04.770
start it up.

37
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.491
I've really,

38
00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:10.491
from the mid 1850s on is more what of the classical kind of way that we've come

39
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:14.220
to consider large scale industrialization.

40
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:17.250
That is with no electricity and steel,

41
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.500
uh,

42
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.500
in the other order and large scale units of production.

43
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.723
So that's the,

44
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.100
that's really the first point.

45
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.630
The second point is that for a very long time,

46
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.160
people who did economic history often whom were historian,

47
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.900
I were economics economists,

48
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.820
tended to,

49
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.910
uh,

50
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:36.600
see,

51
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.900
uh,

52
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.690
Britain as,

53
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.550
as this sort of classic case of large scale industrialization.

54
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:42.030
And,

55
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.271
and,

56
00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:43.950
and even use the,

57
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.090
the most unfortunate word,

58
00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:45.924
retarded,

59
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.590
uh,

60
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.320
when describing a large scale French,

61
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.660
uh,

62
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.820
industrialization.

63
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.190
And the reasons they kinda,

64
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.030
they kind of blundered into that,

65
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.600
that,

66
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.230
uh,

67
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.063
uh,

68
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.550
kind of analysis that really missed the point is that if you added up,

69
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.000
you know,

70
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.990
the number of,

71
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.950
of factories with x number of,

72
00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:03.810
of workers,

73
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.321
uh,

74
00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:07.230
or if you added up the number of steam engines that,

75
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.471
uh,

76
00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:08.230
France,

77
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.580
uh,

78
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.680
lag behind Britain,

79
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:13.230
but until the mid 19th century,

80
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.340
uh,

81
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.911
Francis,

82
00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:17.580
the second largest industrial economy in the world,

83
00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:22.581
and then gradually overtaken by a Germany and then eventually lapped by,

84
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.221
uh,

85
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:24.480
by the United States.

86
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.051
Uh,

87
00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:27.130
but it one of the reasons why,

88
00:02:27.131 --> 00:02:27.251
uh,

89
00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:27.441
they,

90
00:02:27.441 --> 00:02:28.170
they,

91
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.850
uh,

92
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.710
why did these economic historians argue that,

93
00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:33.120
that France couldn't become,

94
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.850
uh,

95
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:34.110
you know,

96
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.520
the major industrial leader was that,

97
00:02:36.521 --> 00:02:41.521
that the capital formation was less easily achieved in France because the

98
00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:45.660
banking and insurance facilities were not that,

99
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:47.320
to be sure of the equal of,

100
00:02:47.321 --> 00:02:48.154
uh,

101
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.050
of Great Britain.

102
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.711
Also,

103
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:54.711
one of the advantages that England had in a large scale industrialization,

104
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.201
uh,

105
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:56.160
was this geography,

106
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.641
uh,

107
00:02:56.641 --> 00:02:58.140
that you had a,

108
00:02:58.141 --> 00:03:00.400
one of the reasons why the railroad in the world,

109
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.851
uh,

110
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:01.601
in about 18,

111
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:02.430
27,

112
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.490
oh,

113
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.621
no,

114
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:03.700
earlier than that actually,

115
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:04.300
uh,

116
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.661
uh,

117
00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:05.261
about 18,

118
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:05.741
19,

119
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:06.574
I guess it is,

120
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.180
uh,

121
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.380
was in England,

122
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.530
uh,

123
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.580
north of here is that it was carrying coal down to the sea.

124
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:13.660
And there's nowhere in England,

125
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:14.890
this more than 75,

126
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:15.330
uh,

127
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.850
uh,

128
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.400
miles away from the ocean.

129
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.791
Uh,

130
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:19.840
in France you had,

131
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:20.280
eh,

132
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.470
the,

133
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.650
the kinds of mind deposits that are so important in,

134
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:24.410
in the German.

135
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.140
Now I,

136
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.920
you've got them in the north here.

137
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.670
Uh,

138
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.750
you've got them in,

139
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:29.663
in our,

140
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.850
of course as disappeared.

141
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:34.900
You have them down in the Soviet home because v and you have them here and there

142
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:35.734
in other places,

143
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.780
particularly around a Sante Tien,

144
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.171
uh,

145
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:40.000
but that they are far from,

146
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.860
uh,

147
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:41.380
uh,

148
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.800
the,

149
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.960
it's very difficult to transport coal.

150
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:45.640
And so that was really kind of the problem.

151
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.420
But if you look at large scale industrialization in France,

152
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:50.020
uh,

153
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.190
it's still proceeds a rather dramatically and in the 18,

154
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.510
uh,

155
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.730
but,

156
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.810
but in the French way,

157
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.280
still involving artists,

158
00:03:57.281 --> 00:04:02.281
no pre production craft production in Paris and other cities and still involving

159
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.640
until quite late in the century rural industry.

160
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.600
No,

161
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.460
as a matter of fact,

162
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.400
we just take an example that I always used because I,

163
00:04:10.401 --> 00:04:11.234
I love the,

164
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.400
I love the place.

165
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.910
Uh,

166
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.121
uh,

167
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:14.260
if you take Ras,

168
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.300
r e m s here,

169
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:16.930
uh,

170
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.010
industrial production,

171
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:19.600
it was a major textile center.

172
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.890
You think it has been in Queasy astrical center because the coordination of the

173
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.860
kings and all that business and uh,

174
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.590
the magnificent cathedral,

175
00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:29.020
a rebuilt by the Americans after World War One and the end,

176
00:04:29.021 --> 00:04:30.770
the basilica of San Jaime.

177
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.210
Uh,

178
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.110
but in the 18,

179
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:33.070
forties and 50s,

180
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:33.400
you,

181
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.611
well,

182
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:33.881
18,

183
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:34.714
thirties and forties,

184
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.030
you still had all sorts of rural industry,

185
00:04:37.031 --> 00:04:39.250
the sort of putting out work into the countryside,

186
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.230
done largely by women.

187
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.920
Uh,

188
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.600
and then gradually you have the growth of large scale industrial production in

189
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:49.090
the context of factories,

190
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.950
but well into the 1870s,

191
00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:55.060
you still had something like 75,000 embroiderers mostly women.

192
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:55.720
Again,

193
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.760
living in the hinterland of,

194
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.310
of Nagase and an 1871,

195
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:04.990
the average unit of production in Paris in Paris was the region was the biggest

196
00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:06.190
industrial center of France,

197
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.070
had only seven people working in it.

198
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.760
So if you're looking for a huge sweatshops,

199
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.770
huge factories that you would find in Manchester and Sheffield and places like

200
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:17.470
that,

201
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.801
uh,

202
00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:19.390
they were pretty rare in,

203
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.230
um,

204
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.380
uh,

205
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.640
in France and indeed some of the biggest units of production were mines,

206
00:05:24.641 --> 00:05:25.450
by the way.

207
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.283
Uh,

208
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.880
Jimmy now is really about the Ansem minds and they are in the north,

209
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:31.750
the north of France,

210
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:33.100
and as that is right,

211
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.950
a couple of kilometers northwest of Valencian,

212
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.690
uh,

213
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:38.620
so right near,

214
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:39.071
uh,

215
00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:40.270
the Belgian border.

216
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.080
But over the long run that and in into this course,

217
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.470
uh,

218
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.970
the 1850s and sixties,

219
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:46.990
which is before this course,

220
00:05:46.991 --> 00:05:47.290
but,

221
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.710
uh,

222
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.150
the large scale industrialization is develops more and more,

223
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.661
uh,

224
00:05:52.661 --> 00:05:57.310
in France and as in Britain and NSF and other places.

225
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.990
In order to have investment in industry,

226
00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:01.280
you have to have a,

227
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:02.240
you have to have capital,

228
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:03.070
you have to have,

229
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.580
uh,

230
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.750
a sort of a surplus of,

231
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.170
uh,

232
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.170
of capital and you have to have a way of feeding a growing population only very

233
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:14.690
slowly in the case of France as you know.

234
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:17.930
And so there is an increase in production in rural production that makes,

235
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:18.764
is possible.

236
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.230
A sort of an agricultural,

237
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.610
a revolution,

238
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.470
a that takes place,

239
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.831
uh,

240
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:27.740
that at certainly has as we'll see in a week or so,

241
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:29.270
a big problems,

242
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.820
uh,

243
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:30.020
uh,

244
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.200
with the Phylloxera epidemic killing off the vineyards of France,

245
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:34.940
which is so important to agricultural,

246
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.480
uh,

247
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.961
production,

248
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:37.600
but you have to eat as well as drink and,

249
00:06:37.601 --> 00:06:39.020
and so there is an increase in,

250
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.540
in production of agriculture all over the place.

251
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.490
And so this is very important.

252
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.780
And just another point,

253
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.340
10 until 10 years ago,

254
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:48.380
people still talking about the long depression.

255
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.921
And they,

256
00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:50.950
that was a very unfortunate term because it gave the,

257
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.891
the sense that,

258
00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:52.910
that the depression that,

259
00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:55.190
that gripped Europe between 1873,

260
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:57.650
1874 in the mid 1890s,

261
00:06:57.651 --> 00:06:59.900
was in any way comparable to the Great Depression,

262
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:00.530
uh,

263
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.450
in industrialized countries and,

264
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:04.040
and not so industrialized countries.

265
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.550
Uh,

266
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.480
but the industrial,

267
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:05.751
uh,

268
00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:06.440
depression,

269
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:06.920
uh,

270
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.510
from 1929 in the case of the U S U us doesn't really get out of it until the

271
00:07:11.511 --> 00:07:13.010
massive arms production,

272
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.460
uh,

273
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.720
following the Pearl Harbor,

274
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.240
uh,

275
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.800
in,

276
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.011
uh,

277
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:17.330
and World War Two.

278
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.050
Um,

279
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.731
there it is a,

280
00:07:18.731 --> 00:07:19.850
it's a depression.

281
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:20.541
Uh,

282
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:20.841
it,

283
00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:21.171
it,

284
00:07:21.171 --> 00:07:21.740
uh,

285
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:21.981
you know,

286
00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:23.090
it's characterized by,

287
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:23.570
uh,

288
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.810
by low prices that you don't have these big sort of catastrophic,

289
00:07:26.811 --> 00:07:27.340
uh,

290
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:27.940
uh,

291
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:28.220
uh,

292
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:28.431
you know,

293
00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:29.930
catastrophic dips.

294
00:07:29.931 --> 00:07:30.310
But,

295
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:30.721
but it,

296
00:07:30.721 --> 00:07:31.011
it's,

297
00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:32.050
it's a depression which,

298
00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:32.884
which undercuts,

299
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.261
uh,

300
00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:34.094
the economy,

301
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:34.401
uh,

302
00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:35.480
in some way,

303
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:35.900
uh,

304
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.430
and particularly hurts rural people because the prices of agricultural goods are

305
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:41.540
so low.

306
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.011
But nonetheless,

307
00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:43.431
if you just,

308
00:07:43.431 --> 00:07:43.671
I mean,

309
00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:44.410
this has,

310
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:44.750
uh,

311
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.010
this is not economics course,

312
00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:47.560
but it's good to have a few figures in.

313
00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.230
Uh,

314
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.591
uh,

315
00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:49.161
nonetheless,

316
00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:50.030
if you look here,

317
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:50.420
the,

318
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.250
the percentage of the population and working in industry in France in 1876 is

319
00:07:55.251 --> 00:07:58.310
27.6% of the population,

320
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.851
uh,

321
00:07:58.851 --> 00:07:59.390
and,

322
00:07:59.390 --> 00:07:59.571
uh,

323
00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:00.740
in 1896,

324
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:03.380
20 years later is 29.2%.

325
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.453
So,

326
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:04.690
I mean,

327
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:05.690
it's quite quite clear.

328
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.270
Pez France is still a peasant society.

329
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.810
Even though many people I have foot in both worlds.

330
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.220
Minors for example,

331
00:08:13.221 --> 00:08:14.090
working in,

332
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:14.690
uh,

333
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:15.523
uh,

334
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.460
oh in mines,

335
00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:16.710
in,

336
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:19.540
in the south of France in a place called a cow milk,

337
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:20.870
which I'll come back to in a while.

338
00:08:20.871 --> 00:08:22.670
A small town in the town.

339
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:23.330
Uh,

340
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.200
they were both,

341
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.740
uh,

342
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:25.760
minors end,

343
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:26.211
uh,

344
00:08:26.211 --> 00:08:27.170
agricultural,

345
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:27.770
uh,

346
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:27.951
you know,

347
00:08:27.951 --> 00:08:29.450
their farmers and day laborers.

348
00:08:29.451 --> 00:08:31.090
And it's the same thing in other minds,

349
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.003
minds of,

350
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:32.361
of,

351
00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:33.194
because v,

352
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:33.650
uh,

353
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:34.100
but the,

354
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.540
but still the number of people whose,

355
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.600
whose principal activity is industry increases and in France also urbanizes that

356
00:08:40.781 --> 00:08:41.840
at the same time,

357
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.190
now the percentage of the population,

358
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.470
1872 that are urban is 21%,

359
00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:50.990
21.1% or something like that.

360
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.550
In 1901,

361
00:08:52.551 --> 00:08:54.620
it's 40.9%.

362
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.231
They're going to say,

363
00:08:55.231 --> 00:08:55.501
boy,

364
00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:56.910
Francis really urbanized.

365
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.310
But that's completely misleading because,

366
00:08:59.340 --> 00:08:59.760
uh,

367
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.200
to be urban in France as of the census of 1841,

368
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.690
you had to have 2000 people.

369
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.110
And that's all in the example I always give is a 2000 people.

370
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:10.710
Uh,

371
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.891
you know,

372
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:14.040
outside the merit and mall when it opens sometimes,

373
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:14.670
uh,

374
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.470
or the Boston post road mall,

375
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:16.681
I mean,

376
00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:19.630
2000 people does not seem like a major,

377
00:09:19.631 --> 00:09:19.920
you know,

378
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.630
urban agglomeration.

379
00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:22.130
Uh,

380
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:22.963
so France,

381
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:23.250
uh,

382
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:28.250
still is the level of urbanization is not comparable to that of the Prussian

383
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.550
Rheinland before 1871 or Germany afterward or the United States.

384
00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:35.040
If you go to Neg Naugatuck valley and you know,

385
00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:36.270
this or rust belt there,

386
00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:36.930
I mean,

387
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:37.410
uh,

388
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:37.860
you know,

389
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.330
the United States urbanizes,

390
00:09:39.331 --> 00:09:41.820
the eastern United States were urbanized as very rapidly.

391
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:42.220
I mean,

392
00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:42.460
frank,

393
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:43.420
we'll come back to this when I,

394
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:44.550
when I talk about cities,

395
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:45.540
but you know,

396
00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:48.570
France does have large cities above all Paris.

397
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:49.230
Uh,

398
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:54.120
but it is primarily an urbanization of very small places of what in French and

399
00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:54.541
in English,

400
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:55.360
the same word,

401
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.430
or you would call Borg,

402
00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:57.520
B O,U r,

403
00:09:57.521 --> 00:09:57.830
g,

404
00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:58.141
s,

405
00:09:58.141 --> 00:09:59.700
which are market towns essentially.

406
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.990
So small towns.

407
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:01.770
So,

408
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:02.071
uh,

409
00:10:02.071 --> 00:10:04.440
we're still dealing with the society,

410
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:05.010
uh,

411
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.530
in which productions overwhelmingly rural,

412
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.550
but in which,

413
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.730
uh,

414
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:08.941
you know,

415
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:11.670
France is becoming a major kind of,

416
00:10:11.671 --> 00:10:13.260
of industrial,

417
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:13.720
uh,

418
00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.910
industrial,

419
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:15.870
uh,

420
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:16.651
producing,

421
00:10:16.651 --> 00:10:17.140
uh,

422
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:17.390
uh,

423
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:18.630
a producing country.

424
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:19.441
Uh,

425
00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:23.130
and one of the things that increases the number of people,

426
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:23.610
I mean,

427
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:24.030
the earth,

428
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.571
the rate of,

429
00:10:24.571 --> 00:10:24.831
of,

430
00:10:24.831 --> 00:10:25.980
of urbanization.

431
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.880
Urbanization is a growth in the proportional number of people living in whatever

432
00:10:29.881 --> 00:10:31.080
you define as cities,

433
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:31.710
uh,

434
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.800
is the goal on the pack or the big departure,

435
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.151
uh,

436
00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:37.140
as rural people leave,

437
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:37.770
uh,

438
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.740
leave the countryside and move into cities.

439
00:10:40.741 --> 00:10:45.741
And this is one of the great social happenings of this entire period.

440
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:46.531
Uh,

441
00:10:46.531 --> 00:10:49.280
and I probably use this artistic for if I didn't,

442
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:49.980
I should have,

443
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:50.940
and I'll use it again,

444
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:51.301
uh,

445
00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:53.370
that in 1851,

446
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.930
1851,

447
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.380
two thirds of all the,

448
00:10:56.381 --> 00:11:01.381
the departments or the pop and France had a larger population in 1851 then they

449
00:11:03.181 --> 00:11:05.070
did in 1939.

450
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:06.720
So that's really incredible.

451
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.410
So you have really huge growth in the industrial north,

452
00:11:10.411 --> 00:11:14.220
and that's what you've been reading about the na that department in Ord,

453
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:14.910
uh,

454
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:17.760
and in other areas with a big major,

455
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:18.350
uh,

456
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:18.691
uh,

457
00:11:18.691 --> 00:11:19.800
center for example,

458
00:11:19.801 --> 00:11:20.521
to lose,

459
00:11:20.521 --> 00:11:20.910
which is,

460
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:21.091
you know,

461
00:11:21.091 --> 00:11:23.370
the fourth or fifth largest city at that time,

462
00:11:23.371 --> 00:11:25.680
way in the south when a Francis most wonderful cities.

463
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.480
Um,

464
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:26.600
you,

465
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.020
so you have departments like that,

466
00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:28.231
that are,

467
00:11:28.231 --> 00:11:30.270
that are growing in population because of,

468
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.220
of people leaving the mountains.

469
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.450
People leaving,

470
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:34.020
uh,

471
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.050
areas of central France is simply aren't we're on top.

472
00:11:37.051 --> 00:11:37.231
I mean,

473
00:11:37.231 --> 00:11:39.060
you can't make enough money to survive,

474
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.080
particularly during an agricultural depression and,

475
00:11:41.081 --> 00:11:42.480
and the wine disease,

476
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.980
we're talking about a catastrophe.

477
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:45.210
The wine disease,

478
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:45.541
you know,

479
00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:48.300
knocks out a much production.

480
00:11:48.301 --> 00:11:48.530
I mean,

481
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.760
[inaudible] knocks out the way people live.

482
00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.480
Uh,

483
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:51.901
and in,

484
00:11:51.901 --> 00:11:52.101
you know,

485
00:11:52.101 --> 00:11:54.940
the port in the south and down down in this part of France,

486
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:55.450
uh,

487
00:11:55.450 --> 00:12:00.340
you already had a huge blow to the rural economy with another disease that comes

488
00:12:00.341 --> 00:12:01.390
along and wipes out,

489
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.580
or at least a severely constraints,

490
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:04.330
uh,

491
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:05.410
the silk industry,

492
00:12:05.411 --> 00:12:06.520
the raw silk industry.

493
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.410
So people get up and leave and they go,

494
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:08.740
ah,

495
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.160
they enter these new jobs like teaching or are clerking,

496
00:12:12.161 --> 00:12:16.840
are working in railroad stations and that transforms the way people live.

497
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:17.770
Uh,

498
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:18.700
and so,

499
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:19.631
you know,

500
00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:24.400
you have to sort of see all of these things that kind of this slow of people

501
00:12:24.401 --> 00:12:25.480
back and forth and,

502
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.130
and even some flows that end.

503
00:12:27.131 --> 00:12:27.341
I mean,

504
00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:28.990
there was since the 16th century,

505
00:12:28.991 --> 00:12:32.470
this pattern of seasonal migration of men,

506
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.480
only men walking,

507
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.490
walking every year,

508
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:41.670
all the way from this part of central France to Paris to haul two other northern

509
00:12:42.191 --> 00:12:44.170
cities to work in the construction industry.

510
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:49.260
They started that in the 16th century and they walk every march and then they

511
00:12:50.381 --> 00:12:51.250
come back every,

512
00:12:51.251 --> 00:12:51.731
every,

513
00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:52.180
uh,

514
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:52.870
November.

515
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:53.980
And so most babies,

516
00:12:53.981 --> 00:12:57.310
if all goes normally are born within the three months period.

517
00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.000
Uh,

518
00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.241
and,

519
00:12:58.241 --> 00:12:59.570
but a huge percentage of the,

520
00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:01.720
of the male workforce walks,

521
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:02.460
uh,

522
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:02.700
uh,

523
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.140
in lines of two all the way to Paris.

524
00:13:05.141 --> 00:13:05.221
It,

525
00:13:05.221 --> 00:13:05.531
it happened.

526
00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:06.770
You also have these patterns from,

527
00:13:06.771 --> 00:13:07.300
uh,

528
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:07.481
uh,

529
00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:09.280
from the Pyrenees down to,

530
00:13:09.281 --> 00:13:09.670
uh,

531
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.761
uh,

532
00:13:09.761 --> 00:13:13.710
Barcelona and from the Alps down to me law or down to Leon,

533
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:14.710
those regions to,

534
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:18.320
and one of the things that happens in this course is that seasonal migrations

535
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.940
stops and those people basically become seasonal migrants.

536
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.360
And the areas from which they came are depopulated.

537
00:13:25.361 --> 00:13:25.631
I mean,

538
00:13:25.631 --> 00:13:28.300
depopulation is one of the most amazing,

539
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.200
uh,

540
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.550
things about rural France.

541
00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:31.171
And that's what it,

542
00:13:31.171 --> 00:13:32.004
it's still,

543
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:32.200
you know,

544
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.100
what has been going last 10 years has been a rediscovery of the countryside.

545
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.270
And a lot of people retire there.

546
00:13:37.271 --> 00:13:40.390
And you have the phenomenon of which called Biological Twang or sort of

547
00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:41.470
dormitory villages,

548
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.011
uh,

549
00:13:42.011 --> 00:13:44.260
where people live when they're working in the city.

550
00:13:44.261 --> 00:13:44.740
But,

551
00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:45.100
uh,

552
00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.840
but one of the astonishing things about,

553
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.991
uh,

554
00:13:46.991 --> 00:13:48.670
seeing all the people killed going to the scene,

555
00:13:48.671 --> 00:13:49.690
the war monuments,

556
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:50.501
particularly in the,

557
00:13:50.501 --> 00:13:52.600
in the [inaudible] trial or places like that,

558
00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:53.231
uh,

559
00:13:53.231 --> 00:13:53.920
is that,

560
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:54.261
you know,

561
00:13:54.261 --> 00:13:55.750
when you see all these dead people,

562
00:13:55.751 --> 00:13:56.584
you see the,

563
00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:56.831
uh,

564
00:13:56.831 --> 00:14:00.400
you can imagine their faces and you see all their names on these huge plaques,

565
00:14:00.401 --> 00:14:00.580
you know,

566
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:00.971
80,

567
00:14:00.971 --> 00:14:01.481
90,

568
00:14:01.481 --> 00:14:03.940
a hundred and or just in these little teeny,

569
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:04.480
you know,

570
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.440
towns in which the countryside has been sort of abandoned and now may be bought

571
00:14:08.441 --> 00:14:09.191
up by the British,

572
00:14:09.191 --> 00:14:09.401
but,

573
00:14:09.401 --> 00:14:09.671
but,

574
00:14:09.671 --> 00:14:10.150
uh,

575
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.080
as in many places,

576
00:14:11.081 --> 00:14:12.250
but so the goal of the path,

577
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.150
the big departure,

578
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:13.601
uh,

579
00:14:13.601 --> 00:14:18.310
for urban areas and new jobs as part of this entire scene as well.

580
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.300
So where is industrial production in the time we're talking about in France?

581
00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:22.990
Well,

582
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:23.440
uh,

583
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:23.830
uh,

584
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.560
where's my a little Jiffy statistic?

585
00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.010
Uh,

586
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:27.581
but in,

587
00:14:27.581 --> 00:14:28.414
in the north,

588
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:28.841
uh,

589
00:14:28.841 --> 00:14:29.630
that is,

590
00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:29.950
uh,

591
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:30.701
certainly the case.

592
00:14:30.701 --> 00:14:34.950
62.1% of the population of people in the na,

593
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:35.500
uh,

594
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.030
that you're reading about a,

595
00:14:37.031 --> 00:14:41.150
or maybe even finishing this one have already finished this wonderful novel our,

596
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:41.440
uh,

597
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:41.731
our,

598
00:14:41.731 --> 00:14:42.564
our workers.

599
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.611
So it's the pure,

600
00:14:43.611 --> 00:14:47.950
so the proletarian they popped him all along with the product la next to it and

601
00:14:47.951 --> 00:14:50.150
the first sort of conurbation a conurbation.

602
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.150
It's cities,

603
00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:52.070
it grows so rapidly.

604
00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:52.430
They,

605
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.060
they all come together like become one city,

606
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:55.530
uh,

607
00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:56.770
is a leave,

608
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.270
which is all had been there for centuries and centuries.

609
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.390
And then who bay and Truqua,

610
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.340
which just grow up their little Manchester's in France,

611
00:15:04.341 --> 00:15:06.110
you find the same thing around Santa Tien.

612
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:11.320
So big heavy mining and textile industry in this part of France for sure.

613
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.090
And the other big industrial region of course,

614
00:15:14.091 --> 00:15:16.310
I mean the biggest is the Paris region,

615
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:17.570
but the Paris region,

616
00:15:17.571 --> 00:15:19.520
you're still producing these articles of Paris.

617
00:15:19.521 --> 00:15:20.121
That's where they call them.

618
00:15:20.121 --> 00:15:21.200
These are to potty,

619
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:24.280
which are things like wallets and shoes and you know,

620
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:28.730
find quality goods that are part of the industrial pride of France.

621
00:15:28.731 --> 00:15:28.941
I mean,

622
00:15:28.941 --> 00:15:32.120
when they had these big expositions and in Victorian England,

623
00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:32.571
you know,

624
00:15:32.571 --> 00:15:34.130
that they're all be these,

625
00:15:34.131 --> 00:15:35.920
these mass produce things in,

626
00:15:35.921 --> 00:15:36.731
in England that,

627
00:15:36.731 --> 00:15:37.011
that,

628
00:15:37.011 --> 00:15:37.400
uh,

629
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.360
that William Morris,

630
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:38.960
uh,

631
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:39.650
uh,

632
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:39.831
you know,

633
00:15:39.831 --> 00:15:42.920
sort of sponsor of arts and craft movement said it was the age of the shotty.

634
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.810
And the French would always proudly say,

635
00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:47.060
we don't turn out this Victorian kind of junk.

636
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.340
We make products of quality.

637
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:54.440
So you had these fine clothes still being made by pretty put together by single,

638
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:56.300
by single women or single men.

639
00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:56.900
Uh,

640
00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:57.920
I might have if they're married or not,

641
00:15:57.921 --> 00:15:58.221
but you know,

642
00:15:58.221 --> 00:16:01.910
but working by themselves at home that are part of their artist,

643
00:16:01.911 --> 00:16:03.440
no structure of Paris,

644
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.890
uh,

645
00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:04.701
where if you went into the,

646
00:16:04.701 --> 00:16:07.430
into the hinterland of Paris or into the industrial suburbs,

647
00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.350
there you have the dirty industries,

648
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:09.711
you know,

649
00:16:09.711 --> 00:16:10.670
soap production,

650
00:16:10.671 --> 00:16:12.230
chemical production that,

651
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.120
that people don't want in the city.

652
00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.330
And the city values are so high that that if you want space,

653
00:16:17.331 --> 00:16:18.770
you're going to build them outside.

654
00:16:18.771 --> 00:16:19.401
More about that.

655
00:16:19.401 --> 00:16:20.570
When I talk about Paris,

656
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:21.350
um,

657
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.980
and then you have the young and the old was the silk workers capital of,

658
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.053
of uh,

659
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:26.720
uh,

660
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.800
really of the world,

661
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:28.220
uh,

662
00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.053
in terms of,

663
00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.020
of production.

664
00:16:30.021 --> 00:16:31.100
And if you want to find one,

665
00:16:31.101 --> 00:16:35.810
if you're going to go to one city and see where every layer of architecture,

666
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.660
every layer of architecture representing the past is,

667
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.441
is there,

668
00:16:39.441 --> 00:16:39.651
I mean,

669
00:16:39.651 --> 00:16:41.690
Leon was the place to go because they've got Gallo,

670
00:16:41.691 --> 00:16:42.350
Roman ruins.

671
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:45.260
You've got medieval fabulous medieval,

672
00:16:45.261 --> 00:16:46.094
a neighborhood.

673
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.821
Uh,

674
00:16:46.821 --> 00:16:47.250
you know,

675
00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:49.130
on the right bank of the Stone River,

676
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:49.581
uh,

677
00:16:49.581 --> 00:16:51.470
you have renaissance quarters,

678
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.801
uh,

679
00:16:51.801 --> 00:16:52.730
that are fabulous.

680
00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:53.331
You have,

681
00:16:53.331 --> 00:16:54.164
um,

682
00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:54.500
uh,

683
00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:54.931
you have,

684
00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:55.320
uh,

685
00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:55.810
uh,

686
00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:59.780
the best 17th century really apartment buildings that are left anywhere.

687
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:00.181
Uh,

688
00:17:00.181 --> 00:17:02.660
in France you have 18th century sort of classic,

689
00:17:02.661 --> 00:17:06.560
the Plus Belko and you have this 19th century industrial suburb.

690
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:08.510
We're right on the hill called the Cwa,

691
00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:10.160
who's where all the,

692
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:14.000
the literally all the buildings have real tall roofs in order to accommodate

693
00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.860
these big silk rooms,

694
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:16.790
which are called jackass.

695
00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:18.290
But you obviously don't have to remember that.

696
00:17:18.291 --> 00:17:22.340
But the point is that this becomes a big industrial center and that even as late

697
00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:23.570
as the 1860s,

698
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.280
you still have merchant capitalists putting work back out into the countryside

699
00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:33.440
in order to take advantage of what of cheap female labor women make one half of

700
00:17:33.441 --> 00:17:36.170
what men do in any trade in Europe.

701
00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:36.740
Uh,

702
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.760
any occupation,

703
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:38.240
uh,

704
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.990
throughout the 19th century and well into the 20th century.

705
00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:42.440
Um,

706
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.470
that you have other artists know,

707
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.080
kind of producing towns you have,

708
00:17:45.081 --> 00:17:45.260
you know,

709
00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.470
to lose as a big artist.

710
00:17:46.471 --> 00:17:47.300
And we'll center,

711
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:47.511
you know,

712
00:17:47.511 --> 00:17:48.890
Maasais produces soap.

713
00:17:48.891 --> 00:17:49.081
I mean,

714
00:17:49.081 --> 00:17:49.370
I,

715
00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:50.400
I could go through the whole map,

716
00:17:50.401 --> 00:17:50.820
but,

717
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:51.840
but I'm not going to do that.

718
00:17:51.841 --> 00:17:54.290
You have old textile towns that are still producing,

719
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:55.980
turning out lots of things like raw,

720
00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:56.750
uh,

721
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:57.780
just one of my favorite towns,

722
00:17:57.781 --> 00:17:57.991
you know,

723
00:17:57.991 --> 00:17:58.201
in,

724
00:17:58.201 --> 00:17:59.520
in Normandy where I teach,

725
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.360
uh,

726
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.160
every year.

727
00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:01.740
Um,

728
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:01.981
uh,

729
00:18:01.981 --> 00:18:04.200
of course that we jam and the two weeks,

730
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:04.980
um,

731
00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.990
and trois and places like that.

732
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:07.441
So these,

733
00:18:07.441 --> 00:18:09.570
but these places are rather a spread apart.

734
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.540
You've got your basic shipbuilding places like San Jose or et Cetera,

735
00:18:12.541 --> 00:18:13.140
et cetera.

736
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:13.760
So,

737
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.280
um,

738
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:19.280
though not gifted by having a primary resources near major waterways,

739
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.971
the exception of,

740
00:18:20.971 --> 00:18:21.440
of,

741
00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:21.740
of,

742
00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.770
of the lower river,

743
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.590
you still have this transformation of,

744
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:26.080
uh,

745
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.431
of,

746
00:18:26.431 --> 00:18:27.181
of the economy,

747
00:18:27.181 --> 00:18:29.700
but there is industrial production of some kind,

748
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:30.390
uh,

749
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:31.770
almost anywhere that you could go.

750
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:34.040
And then you have very specialized cases like limos,

751
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:34.540
uh,

752
00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.810
which is famous for his porcelain.

753
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.160
Maybe more about that,

754
00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:38.660
uh,

755
00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:39.031
later.

756
00:18:39.031 --> 00:18:40.560
Why is it famous for his porcelain?

757
00:18:40.561 --> 00:18:44.340
Because there's a clay that you make porcelain out of called [inaudible],

758
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.990
which was a Chinese term,

759
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.351
uh,

760
00:18:46.351 --> 00:18:47.520
that is available there.

761
00:18:47.521 --> 00:18:48.354
And so that's why,

762
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:48.960
uh,

763
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.040
Havilland porcelain,

764
00:18:50.041 --> 00:18:52.230
which no longer exists incredibly enough.

765
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:52.741
I've,

766
00:18:52.741 --> 00:18:53.490
you know,

767
00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:54.030
uh,

768
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:54.781
who was an American,

769
00:18:54.781 --> 00:18:55.411
I said that before,

770
00:18:55.411 --> 00:18:55.951
but at the end,

771
00:18:55.951 --> 00:18:59.870
it doesn't exist if they're closing their other doors and there's only one I

772
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:01.170
really major producer left.

773
00:19:01.171 --> 00:19:03.540
But these were part of the industrial revolution in,

774
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:04.231
uh,

775
00:19:04.231 --> 00:19:04.740
in,

776
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.190
uh,

777
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.910
love bed,

778
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:06.750
a frost and I,

779
00:19:06.751 --> 00:19:10.110
and because it has now been a next by Germany that is not now,

780
00:19:10.111 --> 00:19:12.010
but in the 1870s and the,

781
00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:12.530
and,

782
00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:13.260
uh,

783
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:17.130
I mean 1871 I didn't talk about all the tests production in Alsace,

784
00:19:17.131 --> 00:19:18.900
but there's lots of textile production there.

785
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.600
And as everywhere it's the textile production,

786
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:21.960
uh,

787
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.220
that is the cutting edge,

788
00:19:23.221 --> 00:19:27.570
the leading edge of the industrial revolution followed by metallurgical

789
00:19:27.571 --> 00:19:28.380
production.

790
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:32.670
And as in the case of a Britain that is the trains,

791
00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:33.000
uh,

792
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.030
helping encourage investment because people can see trains,

793
00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:36.570
uh,

794
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.890
they can ride trains and they look like something that's going to lead France

795
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.660
into this new brave new industrial world.

796
00:19:42.661 --> 00:19:46.170
And so that helps accentuate the number of people who have something to invest,

797
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.540
uh,

798
00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:47.580
investing in,

799
00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:48.270
um,

800
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:48.541
in,

801
00:19:48.541 --> 00:19:49.374
in railroads.

802
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:50.520
As a matter of fact,

803
00:19:50.521 --> 00:19:55.170
one of the things that probably hurts French industry,

804
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:55.560
uh,

805
00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.500
during the exactly the period we're talking about that as the 18,

806
00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.491
a seventies,

807
00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:00.001
eighties,

808
00:20:00.001 --> 00:20:01.640
and the early 1890s,

809
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.260
is the fact that French capitalists began in,

810
00:20:04.261 --> 00:20:06.060
begin investing in railroads.

811
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:08.940
But in other places in Italy,

812
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:10.163
in Russia,

813
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:10.720
uh,

814
00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.060
and in Spain,

815
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:12.450
uh,

816
00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:14.010
where the railroads are,

817
00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:14.250
uh,

818
00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.590
to a great extent built by French capital.

819
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.440
So then you've got people who are from English economist saying,

820
00:20:19.441 --> 00:20:19.621
Oh,

821
00:20:19.621 --> 00:20:19.981
well,

822
00:20:19.981 --> 00:20:23.610
they'll never catch up with us because the peasants all hide their money under

823
00:20:23.611 --> 00:20:24.444
their beds,

824
00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:25.080
uh,

825
00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.790
or bury them in the gardens.

826
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.050
Or people that have capital to invest are investing the money in,

827
00:20:31.051 --> 00:20:31.884
in these other,

828
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.780
these other railroads.

829
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:34.441
Now,

830
00:20:34.441 --> 00:20:35.274
um,

831
00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.503
what about,

832
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:37.740
uh,

833
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:38.670
what about women,

834
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:39.190
uh,

835
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.810
in,

836
00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.010
in all of this,

837
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:41.850
uh,

838
00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:43.110
the role of women in,

839
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.320
you know,

840
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.690
industrial revolution is obviously crucial.

841
00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:46.020
Uh,

842
00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.040
in the case of France,

843
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:47.951
in the case of,

844
00:20:47.951 --> 00:20:48.300
you know,

845
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.160
of Sheffield or on Sheffield or Birmingham and,

846
00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:51.640
uh,

847
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.211
in England,

848
00:20:52.211 --> 00:20:56.560
the role of women in domestic industry or are finishing products,

849
00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:56.921
uh,

850
00:20:56.921 --> 00:20:57.520
was,

851
00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:57.791
uh,

852
00:20:57.791 --> 00:21:01.630
extremely important and extremely persistent.

853
00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:02.753
Uh,

854
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.420
the industrial revolution,

855
00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.750
even the second industrial revolution does not,

856
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:08.141
I mean,

857
00:21:08.141 --> 00:21:13.141
the story is more continuity's a then a dramatic changes in,

858
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:13.810
uh,

859
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:17.200
the production in the role of women in the industrial revolution.

860
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:17.621
I mean,

861
00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:20.350
women had always worked in the textile production,

862
00:21:20.351 --> 00:21:21.790
but they'd worked by themselves,

863
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:22.360
uh,

864
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:22.661
you know,

865
00:21:22.661 --> 00:21:22.991
in the,

866
00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:23.291
in the,

867
00:21:23.291 --> 00:21:24.470
in the von day or,

868
00:21:24.471 --> 00:21:25.420
or anywhere in,

869
00:21:25.421 --> 00:21:25.601
in,

870
00:21:25.601 --> 00:21:26.080
in,

871
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.730
in La Han or almost anywhere,

872
00:21:27.731 --> 00:21:28.060
uh,

873
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:28.420
uh,

874
00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.350
back for centuries.

875
00:21:29.351 --> 00:21:30.430
And they still do,

876
00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:31.240
uh,

877
00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:31.481
uh,

878
00:21:31.481 --> 00:21:32.980
we've exaggerated,

879
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:33.521
uh,

880
00:21:33.521 --> 00:21:36.520
the separation of work and home,

881
00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:37.060
uh,

882
00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.330
in the role of women in the industrial revolution.

883
00:21:40.331 --> 00:21:42.870
Because if you look at Paris and the 1890s,

884
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.990
I have a former graduate student,

885
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:44.801
Judy coffin.

886
00:21:44.801 --> 00:21:48.940
It was a wonderful book on the sewing machine and its role in all of this.

887
00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:53.950
If you look at industrial production of these fine garments and handbags that

888
00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:55.270
are made in Paris,

889
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.160
many of them in the garment industry,

890
00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.720
the garment district of Paris,

891
00:21:58.721 --> 00:21:59.554
which is right in the,

892
00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:01.930
in the center of Paris on the right bank,

893
00:22:01.931 --> 00:22:06.931
around a street called salt ta are done by single women working on in the very

894
00:22:07.001 --> 00:22:12.001
top floors by themselves and working for a merchant capitalist just as their

895
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.040
predecessors had done,

896
00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:15.720
uh,

897
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:15.941
you know,

898
00:22:15.941 --> 00:22:17.530
two centuries before that.

899
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.170
And so those continuity's are still very important.

900
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.230
But to be sure,

901
00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:21.700
you know,

902
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:21.991
in,

903
00:22:21.991 --> 00:22:23.530
in the more sort of classic or,

904
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:24.130
uh,

905
00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:24.311
you know,

906
00:22:24.311 --> 00:22:25.540
the usual kind of thing you hear.

907
00:22:25.541 --> 00:22:25.830
I mean,

908
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:29.770
I'm making a while to be sure they gradually move into factory,

909
00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.041
uh,

910
00:22:30.041 --> 00:22:30.874
production.

911
00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:31.420
Uh,

912
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:32.950
but what does not change is the,

913
00:22:32.951 --> 00:22:36.880
another thing is not changes the role of women in the managing of the household

914
00:22:36.881 --> 00:22:41.881
economy because women have to somehow piece together a enough work I enough,

915
00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:43.091
you know,

916
00:22:43.091 --> 00:22:48.091
enough income from their children and from other husbands or partners in order

917
00:22:48.311 --> 00:22:49.690
to keep the family going.

918
00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:50.160
Uh,

919
00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.430
and women's role in,

920
00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:51.880
uh,

921
00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:55.510
the industrial and the household economy,

922
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:56.020
uh,

923
00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:59.740
is still a extraordinarily important.

924
00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:00.581
Also,

925
00:23:00.581 --> 00:23:04.540
some aspects of women worked at his nonindustrial does not change,

926
00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:05.290
uh,

927
00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:06.071
in England,

928
00:23:06.071 --> 00:23:06.281
in,

929
00:23:06.281 --> 00:23:06.401
in,

930
00:23:06.401 --> 00:23:06.631
in,

931
00:23:06.631 --> 00:23:06.851
in,

932
00:23:06.851 --> 00:23:07.541
in Great Britain.

933
00:23:07.541 --> 00:23:10.240
But let's say England in 1850,

934
00:23:10.241 --> 00:23:12.250
and again in 1880,

935
00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.870
the largest,

936
00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:14.321
uh,

937
00:23:14.321 --> 00:23:17.830
to female occupations are textile operatives,

938
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:20.440
factory workers and domestics.

939
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.011
Uh,

940
00:23:21.011 --> 00:23:23.380
and in France that's the same case too.

941
00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:28.130
And one of the things that d that single women do who come into Paris or legal

942
00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:33.130
or [inaudible] or whatever to try to get a job is they placed themselves in

943
00:23:33.131 --> 00:23:34.270
domestic service.

944
00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:34.870
Uh,

945
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.540
and of course their conditions of work are our lamentable.

946
00:23:37.541 --> 00:23:37.781
And there's,

947
00:23:37.781 --> 00:23:38.710
although an often,

948
00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:39.101
often,

949
00:23:39.101 --> 00:23:41.800
and there's a whole range of literature you know,

950
00:23:41.801 --> 00:23:42.480
about,

951
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:42.640
you know,

952
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.780
about what happens to them.

953
00:23:43.781 --> 00:23:44.690
And of course the,

954
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:45.440
the,

955
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.790
some of the most spectacular,

956
00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:47.540
uh,

957
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:48.350
um,

958
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:49.200
cases of,

959
00:23:49.201 --> 00:23:52.280
of things going wrong are the ones that you hear about from,

960
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:54.560
from social commentators at that time,

961
00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:55.390
which is,

962
00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:55.550
you know,

963
00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:56.300
the single,

964
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.390
a domestic servant service gets impregnated by the,

965
00:23:59.560 --> 00:23:59.750
you know,

966
00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:03.320
by the aggressive older son or younger son of the boss.

967
00:24:03.321 --> 00:24:04.700
And then the minute she is pregnant,

968
00:24:04.701 --> 00:24:06.020
she is out of there.

969
00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:07.100
And then,

970
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:07.281
uh,

971
00:24:07.281 --> 00:24:10.990
that is a fairly quick road in many cases of many rural people to,

972
00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:11.370
uh,

973
00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:11.771
if they can't,

974
00:24:11.771 --> 00:24:12.604
if you are pregnant,

975
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:14.240
you're not going to get hired.

976
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:15.350
Who's going to hire you?

977
00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.590
So then what happens to the baby in France,

978
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:19.783
anywhere,

979
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:24.950
infanticide or abandonment in the foundling homes,

980
00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:25.611
uh,

981
00:24:25.611 --> 00:24:26.444
and uh,

982
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:27.111
what they did.

983
00:24:27.111 --> 00:24:27.291
And so,

984
00:24:27.291 --> 00:24:29.540
so in order to cut down the infanticide rate,

985
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.260
they create this thing and it still was debated again about three months ago in

986
00:24:33.261 --> 00:24:34.070
Rome.

987
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:36.590
They create these things called tour.

988
00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:37.370
Well,

989
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:37.641
I mean,

990
00:24:37.641 --> 00:24:38.560
I don't know you to,

991
00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:38.870
you know,

992
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:39.390
their tool,

993
00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:39.570
they,

994
00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:40.820
these things that turn,

995
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:41.510
uh,

996
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:44.850
and they're liking machines that they used to have in the ill fated machine

997
00:24:44.851 --> 00:24:45.560
city,

998
00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.820
which some of you don't remember,

999
00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:47.420
uh,

1000
00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:47.900
were,

1001
00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:48.171
were,

1002
00:24:48.171 --> 00:24:48.411
you know,

1003
00:24:48.411 --> 00:24:50.690
you put in your money and if you get lucky,

1004
00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.330
you know the product will actually come back towards you.

1005
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:57.080
And what happens there is you ring a little bell on this little thing turns and

1006
00:24:57.081 --> 00:24:58.370
you put the baby in there.

1007
00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:58.821
Uh,

1008
00:24:58.821 --> 00:24:59.510
and then,

1009
00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:03.710
then some nice person keeps the baby cause otherwise you just abandon the baby

1010
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.030
and the baby dies.

1011
00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:07.430
And the number and fantasize every day was tragic.

1012
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.441
And once you got in,

1013
00:25:08.441 --> 00:25:11.030
if you were a baby and you get in one of these funneling homes,

1014
00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:13.910
your chances of survival are very sin.

1015
00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:14.300
Uh,

1016
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:18.090
in every large foundling home are really into the eighth through the 1870

1017
00:25:18.091 --> 00:25:18.210
[inaudible].

1018
00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:19.790
The number of people have babies who,

1019
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:22.400
who die is one third every year.

1020
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.310
So,

1021
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:23.630
um,

1022
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:24.800
that's another reason by the way,

1023
00:25:24.801 --> 00:25:25.280
why,

1024
00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.420
why French cities?

1025
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:27.170
Uh,

1026
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:27.411
you know,

1027
00:25:27.411 --> 00:25:31.310
more people die in French cities that are born in French cities through much of

1028
00:25:31.311 --> 00:25:36.311
the century because of the huge rates of child abandonment and in fantasize.

1029
00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:37.940
Uh,

1030
00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:38.930
so it's,

1031
00:25:38.931 --> 00:25:39.051
uh,

1032
00:25:39.051 --> 00:25:39.261
you know,

1033
00:25:39.261 --> 00:25:40.760
it's a most unfortunate scene.

1034
00:25:40.761 --> 00:25:42.710
And then what happens after a x,

1035
00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:42.891
you know,

1036
00:25:42.891 --> 00:25:47.240
this mother x has her baby abandoned her baby,

1037
00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:48.471
you know,

1038
00:25:48.471 --> 00:25:52.520
and sadly maybe in 10% of the cases kills her baby.

1039
00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:53.330
Uh,

1040
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:54.590
is that uh,

1041
00:25:54.591 --> 00:25:56.240
the road to prostitution,

1042
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.811
uh,

1043
00:25:56.811 --> 00:25:57.440
is,

1044
00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:57.960
uh,

1045
00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:58.970
is a rather,

1046
00:25:58.971 --> 00:25:59.804
um,

1047
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:01.850
rather quick one coming along,

1048
00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:02.260
uh,

1049
00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.430
or tried to get back into a domestic service.

1050
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:05.390
So,

1051
00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:06.223
um,

1052
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.831
but you know,

1053
00:26:06.831 --> 00:26:07.011
for,

1054
00:26:07.011 --> 00:26:07.760
for most,

1055
00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:08.481
for most women,

1056
00:26:08.481 --> 00:26:09.980
things go better than that though.

1057
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.870
They never go splendidly cause they're never going to get,

1058
00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.330
earn what males work earn.

1059
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:15.290
And they're the first,

1060
00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:19.070
the last hired and the first fired right along.

1061
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.370
And then you had this other thing that happens is that the Socialists are quite

1062
00:26:22.371 --> 00:26:24.140
concerned with what happens to,

1063
00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:25.700
to women's wages.

1064
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:29.720
And the unions are quite concerned what happens to women wage women's wages,

1065
00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:32.330
but they're not really concerned about it whether they have the right to vote.

1066
00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:33.613
Why?

1067
00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:35.480
Because the Socialists afraid that because women,

1068
00:26:35.481 --> 00:26:36.231
as I said before,

1069
00:26:36.231 --> 00:26:41.231
I'm more apt to go to church that than men by far then and now that they will

1070
00:26:42.021 --> 00:26:44.790
vote the way the priest tells them in the confessional.

1071
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:49.200
So the Socialists do not support the right of women to vote.

1072
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.970
And women of don't vote in France.

1073
00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:53.340
They don't get the right to vote after World War One,

1074
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.900
despite all the sacrifices.

1075
00:26:54.901 --> 00:26:56.220
They get the right to vote in Britain,

1076
00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:01.470
they don't get the right to vote in France until after World War Two.

1077
00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:02.281
So,

1078
00:27:02.281 --> 00:27:03.000
um,

1079
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:03.730
um,

1080
00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:04.201
again,

1081
00:27:04.201 --> 00:27:04.351
so,

1082
00:27:04.351 --> 00:27:04.591
so,

1083
00:27:04.591 --> 00:27:04.901
so what,

1084
00:27:04.901 --> 00:27:05.101
what,

1085
00:27:05.101 --> 00:27:08.490
what changes to keep your eye on the big picture is that domestic industry

1086
00:27:08.491 --> 00:27:11.400
gradually implodes into,

1087
00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:12.810
into the cities,

1088
00:27:12.811 --> 00:27:15.120
into factories on the edge of,

1089
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:15.840
of,

1090
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:16.320
uh,

1091
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.220
French cities,

1092
00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.630
big and small.

1093
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.150
But that what women do doesn't change.

1094
00:27:21.151 --> 00:27:22.980
They're still doing domestic industry.

1095
00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:24.180
They're still doing,

1096
00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.080
um,

1097
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:25.371
uh,

1098
00:27:25.371 --> 00:27:25.651
I mean,

1099
00:27:25.651 --> 00:27:26.910
they're still doing textile work.

1100
00:27:26.911 --> 00:27:28.170
They're not doing domestic industry.

1101
00:27:28.171 --> 00:27:28.861
Take that back.

1102
00:27:28.861 --> 00:27:29.694
I take that back,

1103
00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:30.563
they are doing,

1104
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.160
uh,

1105
00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:31.770
uh,

1106
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:33.540
textile industry work,

1107
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.520
but increasingly in factories,

1108
00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:36.930
which is the classic,

1109
00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:37.620
uh,

1110
00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:38.453
the classic,

1111
00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:38.770
you know,

1112
00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:40.680
portrayal of the industrial revolution.

1113
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:44.910
And so the classic betrayal ends up being right but only rather gradually in

1114
00:27:44.911 --> 00:27:48.720
France over a very long period period of time or take caffeine.

1115
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:50.490
One of the more engaging figures in,

1116
00:27:50.491 --> 00:27:51.300
in uh,

1117
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.350
in modern French literature.

1118
00:27:52.351 --> 00:27:55.650
I think it's fair to say her experience is perfectly normal.

1119
00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:56.490
Uh,

1120
00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:57.301
it's sad.

1121
00:27:57.301 --> 00:27:58.140
It's pathetic,

1122
00:27:58.650 --> 00:27:59.730
but it's very normal.

1123
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.570
Um,

1124
00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:01.410
give me an example.

1125
00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:01.861
This is,

1126
00:28:01.861 --> 00:28:02.310
um,

1127
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.760
uh,

1128
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.091
you know,

1129
00:28:03.091 --> 00:28:03.421
we don't,

1130
00:28:03.421 --> 00:28:05.580
we live about two and half hours from Santa Tana and I heard they were going to

1131
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.090
Santa Tiana,

1132
00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:08.070
go to their work once in a while in the archives,

1133
00:28:08.071 --> 00:28:08.940
but not that often.

1134
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.900
Um,

1135
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.100
nor do I follow the van,

1136
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:11.691
which is there,

1137
00:28:11.691 --> 00:28:12.750
there a famous,

1138
00:28:12.751 --> 00:28:13.200
uh,

1139
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:13.501
uh,

1140
00:28:13.501 --> 00:28:14.460
a soccer team,

1141
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.220
but there's still an expression that people use their,

1142
00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.700
if a child screws up,

1143
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:19.741
does something,

1144
00:28:19.741 --> 00:28:20.210
you know,

1145
00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:20.610
you know,

1146
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:22.530
you're nine or eight or nine years old,

1147
00:28:22.531 --> 00:28:24.930
use something your parents tell you not to do and you do it anyway.

1148
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:26.520
They'll say something like,

1149
00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:27.560
uh,

1150
00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:32.560
do cement [inaudible] Ben to two weeks under a,

1151
00:28:34.501 --> 00:28:39.501
Ben is a kind of a wagon that's used to haul coal and what children did in

1152
00:28:40.021 --> 00:28:42.870
factories and in minds is because they're small.

1153
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.560
You can put them under one of these wagons and they help move it along the

1154
00:28:46.561 --> 00:28:47.071
tracks.

1155
00:28:47.071 --> 00:28:47.851
That'd be a lot of fun,

1156
00:28:47.851 --> 00:28:48.684
wouldn't it?

1157
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.830
Because they have little shoulders,

1158
00:28:49.831 --> 00:28:51.720
but strong shoulders or,

1159
00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:52.140
uh,

1160
00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:52.411
you know,

1161
00:28:52.411 --> 00:28:52.770
or,

1162
00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:53.101
or,

1163
00:28:53.101 --> 00:28:53.360
uh,

1164
00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:53.551
you know,

1165
00:28:53.551 --> 00:28:57.870
fixing machines in factories with their little fingers,

1166
00:28:57.871 --> 00:28:59.370
which would get chopped off there.

1167
00:28:59.371 --> 00:29:02.940
So careless said a British manufacturer when a couple of them kept getting their

1168
00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:03.990
fingers chopped off.

1169
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.800
Um,

1170
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.390
and so a way of correcting,

1171
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.701
you know,

1172
00:29:06.701 --> 00:29:07.161
a child,

1173
00:29:07.161 --> 00:29:08.250
we say two weeks,

1174
00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.190
we will push and that thing around and you won't screw up.

1175
00:29:11.191 --> 00:29:12.660
You'll do what I tell you to do.

1176
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:13.321
Uh,

1177
00:29:13.321 --> 00:29:13.561
you know,

1178
00:29:13.561 --> 00:29:15.030
you won't skip school.

1179
00:29:15.031 --> 00:29:16.980
You'll go to school and this sort of thing.

1180
00:29:16.981 --> 00:29:18.660
So these expressions still linger.

1181
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.040
So child labor too,

1182
00:29:20.041 --> 00:29:20.371
again,

1183
00:29:20.371 --> 00:29:20.551
I mean,

1184
00:29:20.551 --> 00:29:25.440
there is opposition to schooling from families who need that extra income or

1185
00:29:25.441 --> 00:29:27.540
that extra labor of children,

1186
00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.290
uh,

1187
00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:28.591
uh,

1188
00:29:28.591 --> 00:29:30.210
in the farm yard.

1189
00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:30.580
Uh,

1190
00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.720
or watching the sheep and the transhumanists,

1191
00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:34.171
uh,

1192
00:29:34.171 --> 00:29:35.940
moving the sheep into the mountain and all that.

1193
00:29:35.941 --> 00:29:36.400
So the,

1194
00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:36.871
these again,

1195
00:29:36.871 --> 00:29:38.910
these continuity's and changes are,

1196
00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:39.361
uh,

1197
00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:40.200
extremely,

1198
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.070
um,

1199
00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:41.620
uh,

1200
00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.453
extremely,

1201
00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:42.670
uh,

1202
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:43.540
important.

1203
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:44.801
Now.

1204
00:29:44.801 --> 00:29:45.130
Um,

1205
00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:45.790
I didn't,

1206
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.470
and I don't think I have time to do this now,

1207
00:29:47.471 --> 00:29:51.730
but I'll do it some time to talk about the decline of the French population.

1208
00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:55.360
Why France simply stops having children.

1209
00:29:55.361 --> 00:29:56.410
I've talked a little bit about that,

1210
00:29:56.411 --> 00:29:57.580
but I have to come back and do that again.

1211
00:29:57.581 --> 00:29:58.900
I think I'll wait till we're talking about,

1212
00:29:59.210 --> 00:29:59.710
uh,

1213
00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:03.010
about the origins of World War One because that's when it really frightened

1214
00:30:03.011 --> 00:30:03.720
people,

1215
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.090
uh,

1216
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:06.700
because it didn't look like there'd be no French to survive,

1217
00:30:06.701 --> 00:30:06.911
to,

1218
00:30:06.911 --> 00:30:07.420
uh,

1219
00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:10.390
maybe fight a war against all those rapidly breeding Germans.

1220
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:11.051
Uh,

1221
00:30:11.051 --> 00:30:12.790
and things weren't working there.

1222
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
So what I want to talk to about now is how workers viewed what was happening to

1223
00:30:18.011 --> 00:30:18.844
them.

1224
00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:19.390
Um,

1225
00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:23.680
and so there's really kind of three things I want to say.

1226
00:30:23.681 --> 00:30:24.270
The first is,

1227
00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:25.540
is quick is,

1228
00:30:25.541 --> 00:30:28.240
is that proletarian [inaudible] is both an,

1229
00:30:28.241 --> 00:30:30.310
and this was a word that people used was,

1230
00:30:30.311 --> 00:30:34.270
is both an objective and a subjective concept.

1231
00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:34.961
Uh,

1232
00:30:34.961 --> 00:30:39.961
and the third is to talk about how workers viewed the factory and viewed their

1233
00:30:40.751 --> 00:30:43.060
bosses because the period,

1234
00:30:43.061 --> 00:30:48.061
particularly 1895 to 1907 has been called the heroic age of syndicate realism or

1235
00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:54.160
union organization and strikes in France.

1236
00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:56.920
Now Proletarian Ization uh,

1237
00:30:56.950 --> 00:31:01.950
we live in a country in which a part of the Canon is always been that,

1238
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:03.071
uh,

1239
00:31:03.071 --> 00:31:04.240
that in in America,

1240
00:31:04.241 --> 00:31:05.080
if you work hard,

1241
00:31:05.081 --> 00:31:06.430
you'll always be rewarded at the end.

1242
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:07.710
And that,

1243
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:08.000
that,

1244
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:08.430
that,

1245
00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:08.830
uh,

1246
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:11.360
that the descriptions of,

1247
00:31:11.361 --> 00:31:15.340
of the late 19th century is that the people working very hard and doing very

1248
00:31:15.341 --> 00:31:19.000
well and moving into the middle and the upper classes and becoming very wealthy.

1249
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:19.630
Uh,

1250
00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:20.980
obviously that's not the case.

1251
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.730
Uh,

1252
00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:22.091
that the,

1253
00:31:22.091 --> 00:31:25.840
the great exceptions where the one that people paid attention to there is social

1254
00:31:25.841 --> 00:31:28.360
mobility in France or used to be all sorts of studies.

1255
00:31:28.361 --> 00:31:29.370
That's what people did not mean.

1256
00:31:29.371 --> 00:31:29.711
But in the,

1257
00:31:29.711 --> 00:31:30.190
in the,

1258
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:30.491
in the,

1259
00:31:30.491 --> 00:31:33.640
in the 1970s about social mobility,

1260
00:31:33.641 --> 00:31:35.230
but social mobility was,

1261
00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:35.860
uh,

1262
00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:40.360
was extremely limited for people who were born into,

1263
00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:41.020
um,

1264
00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.340
into their working class.

1265
00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:42.731
Uh,

1266
00:31:42.731 --> 00:31:44.350
and in 1968,

1267
00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:45.970
1968,

1268
00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:51.270
the riots de la revolutional monkey in 1968,

1269
00:31:52.151 --> 00:31:57.151
one of the big issues that students your age had and professors my age had a

1270
00:31:59.411 --> 00:32:01.180
though I was your age then,

1271
00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:02.740
or a little younger I guess,

1272
00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:03.250
uh,

1273
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:04.070
was that,

1274
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.510
uh,

1275
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:06.370
you could work your ass off,

1276
00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:07.330
um,

1277
00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:10.870
and your chances of getting into a university weren't very good because once you

1278
00:32:10.871 --> 00:32:11.950
were born into,

1279
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.490
you know,

1280
00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:13.570
the lower classes,

1281
00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:14.140
uh,

1282
00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.570
the schools where we're schools of elites,

1283
00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:17.860
that's what they were.

1284
00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.870
And once you got through there,

1285
00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:22.000
there was no guarantee you're going to get a job anywhere.

1286
00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.420
And people were extremely mad and upset and they,

1287
00:32:24.421 --> 00:32:25.254
they viewed,

1288
00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:26.650
they blame capitalism.

1289
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:27.880
They blame the state,

1290
00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:28.450
uh,

1291
00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:29.200
as people.

1292
00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.660
Their predecessors had an in the 1890s,

1293
00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:32.440
uh,

1294
00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:37.440
and so people who were born into a life of work,

1295
00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:38.770
a life of hard,

1296
00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:39.740
difficult work,

1297
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.520
uh,

1298
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.120
that was one,

1299
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:41.361
you know,

1300
00:32:41.361 --> 00:32:41.900
you ended up,

1301
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:42.920
you were born into,

1302
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:45.230
into the jobs that you would get a,

1303
00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:45.780
and if,

1304
00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.830
I'll give you another San Antonian example because it's so important.

1305
00:32:48.831 --> 00:32:49.664
Senate Tien,

1306
00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:50.090
uh,

1307
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:52.430
that there are lots of people who moved to Santa Tn.

1308
00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:56.300
Don't have to remember this come from a very religious part of France called the

1309
00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:58.940
law of which the capitalist loop,

1310
00:32:58.941 --> 00:32:59.510
we,

1311
00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:00.291
and a lot of these,

1312
00:33:00.291 --> 00:33:00.560
these,

1313
00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.150
these people emptying out,

1314
00:33:02.151 --> 00:33:05.240
that department moved to Santa Tien and they don't move.

1315
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:05.481
You know,

1316
00:33:05.481 --> 00:33:06.590
some of them become teachers,

1317
00:33:06.591 --> 00:33:09.020
some they're going to get clerks jobs if they're educated,

1318
00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.540
but they don't do very well.

1319
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:12.140
Uh,

1320
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:13.590
and they live that,

1321
00:33:13.591 --> 00:33:13.900
you know,

1322
00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.300
there are periods where they're doing all right and then they're let go and then

1323
00:33:17.301 --> 00:33:18.230
they're doing all right.

1324
00:33:18.231 --> 00:33:19.370
And then they're let go.

1325
00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.440
And it's just the more you read about about 18,

1326
00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:22.910
uh,

1327
00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:23.900
80s and 90s,

1328
00:33:23.901 --> 00:33:27.210
and sort of memoirs of working people was just the difficulty of,

1329
00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:30.380
of making things work from a day to day,

1330
00:33:30.381 --> 00:33:31.214
week to week,

1331
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.113
month to month,

1332
00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:33.320
just getting by.

1333
00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.340
And they learned to hate.

1334
00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:34.720
I,

1335
00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.510
I'm a writing a book about a guy who will tell you about some day who really,

1336
00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:40.730
he said that love can make you hate.

1337
00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:41.290
And,

1338
00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:41.771
and he,

1339
00:33:41.771 --> 00:33:45.890
he viewed all of this and then he set out to destroy the state that he thought

1340
00:33:45.891 --> 00:33:47.190
had made capitalist impossible.

1341
00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.910
But that's another story for another day.

1342
00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:50.810
So,

1343
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:51.021
you know,

1344
00:33:51.021 --> 00:33:53.540
there's this objective statues status of,

1345
00:33:53.541 --> 00:33:54.320
of being,

1346
00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:54.561
you know,

1347
00:33:54.561 --> 00:33:54.711
you're,

1348
00:33:54.711 --> 00:33:55.401
you're a worker.

1349
00:33:55.401 --> 00:33:56.960
That's what you do and you're proud of it.

1350
00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.850
And you were blue as a color.

1351
00:33:59.180 --> 00:33:59.360
Uh,

1352
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.410
you wear your blue,

1353
00:34:00.411 --> 00:34:00.591
you know,

1354
00:34:00.591 --> 00:34:01.101
frock,

1355
00:34:01.101 --> 00:34:01.821
her smock,

1356
00:34:01.821 --> 00:34:02.690
whatever you call it.

1357
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:03.350
Uh,

1358
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:05.990
and you spoke a language in our goal read.

1359
00:34:05.991 --> 00:34:06.470
Uh,

1360
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.831
you know,

1361
00:34:06.831 --> 00:34:08.500
if you read a law somewhere,

1362
00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:08.801
you know,

1363
00:34:08.801 --> 00:34:09.351
in France,

1364
00:34:09.351 --> 00:34:09.561
I mean,

1365
00:34:09.561 --> 00:34:10.230
it's a,

1366
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:13.760
it's a language that's extremely difficult to read because a lot of the

1367
00:34:13.761 --> 00:34:15.020
expressions have disappeared.

1368
00:34:15.021 --> 00:34:15.590
But it's a,

1369
00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:17.630
it's a way of protecting your identity.

1370
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:18.171
Uh,

1371
00:34:18.171 --> 00:34:19.940
it's like the way people talked in the suburbs,

1372
00:34:19.941 --> 00:34:21.460
particularly in the 19 century,

1373
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:22.400
1980s,

1374
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:24.020
1990s on very long.

1375
00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:24.411
It's a,

1376
00:34:24.411 --> 00:34:24.681
it's a,

1377
00:34:24.681 --> 00:34:25.880
it's a kind of language,

1378
00:34:25.881 --> 00:34:29.900
kind of an are of a slang and our goal that helps protect your identity,

1379
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:31.670
that you're proud of your identity.

1380
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.930
And you know,

1381
00:34:32.931 --> 00:34:34.730
they were proud of being workers as well.

1382
00:34:34.731 --> 00:34:35.564
They should.

1383
00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:40.660
But the subjective aspect is what people studied in the 1960s and seventies.

1384
00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:43.730
And the term is class consciousness.

1385
00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.930
And certainly there was an attempt to prove that all workers all over the place

1386
00:34:47.931 --> 00:34:48.920
where class conscious,

1387
00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:50.240
but that wasn't the case.

1388
00:34:50.241 --> 00:34:51.680
People have other identities,

1389
00:34:51.681 --> 00:34:52.730
collective identities.

1390
00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.350
You can have multiple identities,

1391
00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:55.191
family,

1392
00:34:55.191 --> 00:34:56.024
religion,

1393
00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:56.780
uh,

1394
00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:57.501
region.

1395
00:34:57.501 --> 00:34:59.060
We've talked about this village,

1396
00:34:59.210 --> 00:34:59.721
et Cetera,

1397
00:34:59.721 --> 00:35:00.500
et cetera.

1398
00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:05.500
But the fact remains that one of the reasons why there's so many strikes in

1399
00:35:05.601 --> 00:35:08.040
France as another country's too,

1400
00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:08.690
uh,

1401
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:13.340
it has to do on one hand with unionization and the sympathetic role of,

1402
00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:16.820
of left wing politicians in supporting,

1403
00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:17.420
uh,

1404
00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.160
working class organization.

1405
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:24.110
But it has also as much to do with people coming to a sense that they are

1406
00:35:24.111 --> 00:35:26.960
workers and are conscious of themselves as a class,

1407
00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:31.280
and they view this state and the wealthy people as being contrary to their

1408
00:35:31.281 --> 00:35:32.114
interest.

1409
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.510
Now,

1410
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:33.770
this starts in France,

1411
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.160
starts in earlier among artisans in,

1412
00:35:36.161 --> 00:35:36.720
in Britain,

1413
00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.750
and arguably in the 1790s in France.

1414
00:35:39.751 --> 00:35:42.820
It really starts in the nineties and the eighties,

1415
00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.150
the 1830 [inaudible].

1416
00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:47.610
And the word socialism was first used by a socialist.

1417
00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:48.050
Uh,

1418
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:48.400
uh,

1419
00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.250
in 1834,

1420
00:35:50.251 --> 00:35:53.490
a guy called Pierre [inaudible] who was a utopian socialist,

1421
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:53.680
uh,

1422
00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:54.420
forgetting.

1423
00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:54.690
Um,

1424
00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:55.140
but he's,

1425
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:55.980
he's an interesting guy.

1426
00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:56.880
Um,

1427
00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.340
but it's at this point where artisans,

1428
00:35:59.341 --> 00:36:03.750
not ordinary workers but see themselves as a class apart though at the beginning

1429
00:36:03.751 --> 00:36:07.440
they'd want it anything to do with these unskilled workers that they may work

1430
00:36:07.441 --> 00:36:08.251
with under,

1431
00:36:08.251 --> 00:36:09.180
in a factory,

1432
00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:10.770
but they're dressed nicely.

1433
00:36:10.771 --> 00:36:12.180
They were a quarter ray suits.

1434
00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:13.530
And these other workers,

1435
00:36:13.531 --> 00:36:15.750
they don't dress like that and they're educated.

1436
00:36:15.751 --> 00:36:17.700
That's why artisans are at the forefront.

1437
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.530
They create the strike really,

1438
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:20.280
uh,

1439
00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.600
in the early modern period.

1440
00:36:21.601 --> 00:36:22.530
It's artisans,

1441
00:36:22.531 --> 00:36:23.790
it's skilled craftsmen.

1442
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:25.800
And just in two minutes,

1443
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:27.120
why does this happen?

1444
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.511
What,

1445
00:36:27.511 --> 00:36:31.740
why to artisans suddenly start seeing themselves as a class apart?

1446
00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.280
Why do they start targeting capitalism as a structure,

1447
00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:35.641
uh,

1448
00:36:35.641 --> 00:36:39.660
and the state as doing them a injustice?

1449
00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:40.643
Why?

1450
00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:40.861
Well,

1451
00:36:40.861 --> 00:36:43.530
they're really two reasons that that one can give.

1452
00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:44.011
Uh,

1453
00:36:44.011 --> 00:36:48.090
one is that what happens because of the French revolution to craftsman in

1454
00:36:48.091 --> 00:36:48.840
Germany,

1455
00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.090
in parts of Italy and in France,

1456
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.391
uh,

1457
00:36:51.391 --> 00:36:56.040
is that that it opens the doors and the guild protections are gone.

1458
00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:59.760
Anybody can be any trade you want laissez faire,

1459
00:36:59.761 --> 00:37:00.594
capitalism.

1460
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:02.010
You want to be a plumber,

1461
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:02.970
you can be a plumber,

1462
00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:04.620
you want to be a tailor,

1463
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:05.730
you can be a tailor.

1464
00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.070
And so all of a sudden in the,

1465
00:37:08.071 --> 00:37:09.690
in Paris and the 1830s,

1466
00:37:09.691 --> 00:37:10.051
forties,

1467
00:37:10.051 --> 00:37:10.561
and 50s,

1468
00:37:10.561 --> 00:37:13.770
there's all sorts of wagons being pushed through the street with beautifully

1469
00:37:13.771 --> 00:37:16.230
made clothes on him going for practically nothing.

1470
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.070
Uh,

1471
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:20.190
because there's so many other tailors making suits and the price,

1472
00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:21.690
the wages these guys get.

1473
00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:23.910
Marx was right about only about that.

1474
00:37:23.911 --> 00:37:25.210
And so far as his assessment of,

1475
00:37:25.211 --> 00:37:26.044
of wages,

1476
00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:27.600
artisans are making less money.

1477
00:37:27.601 --> 00:37:29.070
Their world is falling apart.

1478
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:30.210
They have the dignity,

1479
00:37:30.211 --> 00:37:30.961
they have the skill,

1480
00:37:30.961 --> 00:37:31.711
they have the knowledge,

1481
00:37:31.711 --> 00:37:34.950
they have the organization in friendly societies,

1482
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:38.670
which at a minimum give you a decent burial is you're not dumped into some prop

1483
00:37:38.671 --> 00:37:39.504
operas grave.

1484
00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:43.770
And they're mad because who let all these other people do the trades,

1485
00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.930
the guilds had protected.

1486
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.840
And the other thing that happens is it goes back to where we started

1487
00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:54.050
industrialization and mechanize production that if you go to a market in a

1488
00:37:54.381 --> 00:37:54.840
class,

1489
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.800
since they used that example before or anywhere you want in Oh banal or provide

1490
00:37:58.801 --> 00:37:59.170
an impulse,

1491
00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:00.003
Ooh,

1492
00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:03.330
you can go there and you can buy a suit off the rack.

1493
00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:08.970
You can just go and buy a suit and you don't have to pay somebody a lot of money

1494
00:38:08.971 --> 00:38:10.560
to make your suit from getting to the end.

1495
00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.053
Um,

1496
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:13.140
so because,

1497
00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:13.993
and it's cheaper.

1498
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.270
So who does that hurt?

1499
00:38:15.271 --> 00:38:16.230
It hurts the artisans,

1500
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:17.333
the craftsmen.

1501
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:18.780
And so what happens then?

1502
00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:19.773
Uh Huh.

1503
00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:21.060
Somebody with money says,

1504
00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:22.043
Hey,

1505
00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:23.460
you guys are all Taylor's,

1506
00:38:23.461 --> 00:38:24.480
you're not doing so well.

1507
00:38:24.481 --> 00:38:25.314
Are you?

1508
00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:26.670
Things aren't real good.

1509
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.971
Well,

1510
00:38:26.971 --> 00:38:27.804
I'll tell you what,

1511
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:28.703
I'll tell you what,

1512
00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:32.250
I will pay you to make pants cuffs.

1513
00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:33.600
I don't know much about suits.

1514
00:38:33.601 --> 00:38:34.500
As you probably gathered,

1515
00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:36.460
I will tell you to make pants,

1516
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:36.911
pants,

1517
00:38:36.911 --> 00:38:37.570
cuffs.

1518
00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:38.670
I make you make pants,

1519
00:38:38.671 --> 00:38:38.861
cuffs,

1520
00:38:38.861 --> 00:38:39.610
I guess you have to.

1521
00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:42.100
Or to make sleeves on a jacket.

1522
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:45.550
And all I want you to do is make it a hundred sleeves on a jacket.

1523
00:38:45.551 --> 00:38:46.660
You make the left ones,

1524
00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.060
you make the right ones and I'll pay you.

1525
00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:51.790
It's just like domestic industry before.

1526
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.111
Are they mad?

1527
00:38:53.111 --> 00:38:56.230
Of course they're furious and they s they go out and strike,

1528
00:38:56.231 --> 00:38:56.821
but they always did.

1529
00:38:56.821 --> 00:38:57.654
They lose.

1530
00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.700
And you can strike in France after 1864.

1531
00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.650
So that's what happens to them.

1532
00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:04.540
Or let me give you another example from,

1533
00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:06.260
from good old Lee Moje.

1534
00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:06.700
Uh,

1535
00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:07.533
in Limos,

1536
00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:08.040
uh,

1537
00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:08.280
you,

1538
00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:08.561
you know,

1539
00:39:08.561 --> 00:39:09.430
plates you take,

1540
00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:14.460
you got plates and plates had always been beautiful plates had been hand

1541
00:39:14.681 --> 00:39:15.514
painted.

1542
00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:16.643
[inaudible]

1543
00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:17.860
the painter,

1544
00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.240
he started life as a,

1545
00:39:19.241 --> 00:39:19.541
as a,

1546
00:39:19.541 --> 00:39:20.710
as a porcelain painter.

1547
00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:22.451
And then,

1548
00:39:22.451 --> 00:39:24.700
and that's what made it a quality item.

1549
00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:25.520
If you can,

1550
00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:28.870
if you find painted Limoges plates from the 1880s,

1551
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:32.080
you hang on to those babies and don't put them in the microwave.

1552
00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:33.160
Uh,

1553
00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:37.900
so then what happens with somebody invents a process where you can put like a

1554
00:39:37.901 --> 00:39:42.901
decal on a child's toy onto the plate and bake the decal onto the plate between

1555
00:39:43.841 --> 00:39:45.100
the first and second baking.

1556
00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:48.760
So what happens is these people who are very talented who made all this money

1557
00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:50.200
and didn't hang around,

1558
00:39:50.201 --> 00:39:52.120
you know with these other guys who make less money,

1559
00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:54.483
they are screwed.

1560
00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.200
No one's going to hire them.

1561
00:39:56.201 --> 00:39:57.130
We'll keep one or two.

1562
00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:00.670
I went to a special order that had been done for the Shah of Iran.

1563
00:40:00.671 --> 00:40:01.870
This was a long time ago,

1564
00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:05.650
hand painted cause he wanted to hand painted but that's the end of that.

1565
00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:09.130
And they ended up in their warehouse or ended up doing whatever they could or

1566
00:40:09.131 --> 00:40:09.821
glass workers.

1567
00:40:09.821 --> 00:40:10.510
The same thing.

1568
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:14.140
The people that that made bottles were very skilled and they were called

1569
00:40:14.141 --> 00:40:16.170
[inaudible].

1570
00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:19.360
They were called the Mr a glass worker.

1571
00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:23.680
And suddenly somebody United States invents a machine that can make glasses.

1572
00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:24.670
I'm a bottles,

1573
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.421
turn out,

1574
00:40:25.421 --> 00:40:28.120
thousands of them be filled with wine and other things.

1575
00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:29.720
Who needs these guys anymore?

1576
00:40:29.721 --> 00:40:31.570
And they'd go on the road to Belgium or where they can't.

1577
00:40:31.571 --> 00:40:36.000
Nobody needs somebody any more machine is eliminated them are they mad ho and

1578
00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:36.640
shoemakers.

1579
00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.470
The same thing these machines made in Saint Louis,

1580
00:40:38.471 --> 00:40:40.630
Missouri I think come along and wipe out,

1581
00:40:40.631 --> 00:40:40.781
you know,

1582
00:40:40.781 --> 00:40:41.980
certain aspects of shoemaking.

1583
00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:46.480
So this is leads people to think there are something that we can't control out

1584
00:40:46.481 --> 00:40:50.050
there that is affecting our lives in a very ruinous way.

1585
00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:54.940
So these people are at the forefront of labor militancy.

1586
00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:58.570
And in the course of the 1880s and 1890s,

1587
00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.040
they start thinking about,

1588
00:41:00.041 --> 00:41:00.401
hey,

1589
00:41:00.401 --> 00:41:00.671
you know,

1590
00:41:00.671 --> 00:41:02.350
those people that we don't drink with,

1591
00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:03.401
you know,

1592
00:41:03.401 --> 00:41:07.330
the ones who load of things carry things around.

1593
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:09.340
Ordinary workers maybe,

1594
00:41:09.341 --> 00:41:09.581
you know,

1595
00:41:09.581 --> 00:41:10.540
maybe they got the same,

1596
00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:11.830
maybe the same enemy,

1597
00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:14.140
and then they start supporting,

1598
00:41:14.141 --> 00:41:14.980
they're hesitant,

1599
00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:18.130
organizational movements and strikes and they,

1600
00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:18.611
uh,

1601
00:41:18.611 --> 00:41:19.630
they get together.

1602
00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:25.030
Now how did this look from the point of view of,

1603
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:25.450
you know,

1604
00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:25.661
of,

1605
00:41:25.661 --> 00:41:26.261
of workers,

1606
00:41:26.261 --> 00:41:28.960
how do they view what was happening to them?

1607
00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:30.221
You know,

1608
00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:30.551
again,

1609
00:41:30.551 --> 00:41:32.890
we can romanticize class consciousness.

1610
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:37.990
We can remat assize this idea of a moral economy that people ought to be paid,

1611
00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:38.720
uh,

1612
00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.670
for a good wage,

1613
00:41:40.671 --> 00:41:42.200
for a good day's work.

1614
00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:43.130
Uh,

1615
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:45.380
and it didn't happen all over the place,

1616
00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:49.210
but still it's rather a rather impressive and,

1617
00:41:49.211 --> 00:41:49.441
and,

1618
00:41:49.441 --> 00:41:50.360
and depressing,

1619
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:51.130
uh,

1620
00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:54.080
impressive the organization and depressing the view of,

1621
00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:57.620
of capitalism and the factory is these units of production,

1622
00:41:57.830 --> 00:41:58.020
uh,

1623
00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:00.320
get larger and larger.

1624
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:02.840
Let me give you two examples how this look,

1625
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:06.170
one during strikes.

1626
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:10.520
What was the image that workers had of their bosses?

1627
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.230
And what does this tell us?

1628
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:13.071
And My,

1629
00:42:13.071 --> 00:42:13.341
my,

1630
00:42:13.341 --> 00:42:13.670
uh,

1631
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:15.500
friend and cherish colleague,

1632
00:42:15.501 --> 00:42:16.830
one of the greatest stories I've ever known,

1633
00:42:16.831 --> 00:42:17.740
one of the great people I've ever know,

1634
00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:20.300
knowing Michelle pet ho in France and did,

1635
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:20.740
uh,

1636
00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.570
did work on this among other Virgina,

1637
00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:22.810
sees,

1638
00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:23.480
uh,

1639
00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:24.313
works,

1640
00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:25.153
um,

1641
00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:25.460
uh,

1642
00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:29.270
the view of the other in the 1820s and 1830s,

1643
00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.010
when artisans went on strike,

1644
00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:31.731
you know,

1645
00:42:31.731 --> 00:42:32.630
they knew the boss,

1646
00:42:32.631 --> 00:42:33.464
the master,

1647
00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:35.420
and the wasp was somebody who,

1648
00:42:35.421 --> 00:42:35.780
you know,

1649
00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:37.240
they'd see and all that.

1650
00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:38.570
And they seem around,

1651
00:42:38.571 --> 00:42:38.861
but they're,

1652
00:42:38.861 --> 00:42:39.860
they're kind of mad at him.

1653
00:42:39.861 --> 00:42:41.550
So we're going to withdraw our labor for awhile.

1654
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:42.021
We don't,

1655
00:42:42.021 --> 00:42:42.680
you know,

1656
00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:42.861
uh,

1657
00:42:42.861 --> 00:42:44.090
you got to pay us more.

1658
00:42:44.091 --> 00:42:44.301
You know,

1659
00:42:44.301 --> 00:42:46.220
you gotta be the guy you can be,

1660
00:42:46.221 --> 00:42:48.920
you ought to be the guy you can be in pay us adjust wage.

1661
00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:50.630
Well the master,

1662
00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:50.960
you know,

1663
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.370
he has pretty good relations with them.

1664
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:53.000
He May,

1665
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:53.420
uh,

1666
00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:53.631
you know,

1667
00:42:53.631 --> 00:42:53.991
like the,

1668
00:42:53.991 --> 00:42:54.181
the,

1669
00:42:54.181 --> 00:42:54.370
the,

1670
00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:54.691
the,

1671
00:42:54.691 --> 00:42:54.871
the,

1672
00:42:54.871 --> 00:42:58.060
the like the Noble Inn in to lose.

1673
00:42:58.061 --> 00:42:59.300
He me around to news.

1674
00:42:59.301 --> 00:43:00.134
He may give them a,

1675
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.411
you know,

1676
00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:02.960
a chicken and Easter or something like that,

1677
00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:03.941
but he,

1678
00:43:03.941 --> 00:43:06.680
somebody recognizable and he's paternalistic,

1679
00:43:06.681 --> 00:43:08.030
but this time he's gone wrong.

1680
00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:09.230
So we're going to go out on him,

1681
00:43:09.231 --> 00:43:10.580
will blacklist them and all that.

1682
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.070
What about the 1850s and 1860s?

1683
00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:15.410
Why that is very different indeed.

1684
00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:20.180
They 1850s in 1862 if you look at the vocabulary of people on strike that they,

1685
00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:20.511
that,

1686
00:43:20.511 --> 00:43:20.691
you know,

1687
00:43:20.691 --> 00:43:21.950
they still know the boss,

1688
00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:22.791
they say to the boss,

1689
00:43:22.791 --> 00:43:23.230
uh,

1690
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:24.063
uh,

1691
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:25.280
but they call them a latch.

1692
00:43:25.281 --> 00:43:28.760
He's alleged cause he hits on is a female work or something often with,

1693
00:43:28.761 --> 00:43:29.840
with some success.

1694
00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:30.530
Uh,

1695
00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:31.300
he's a,

1696
00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:31.620
uh,

1697
00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:31.880
you know,

1698
00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:32.300
he's,

1699
00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:37.160
he's gross or eats too much or he drinks too much or a beats his wife,

1700
00:43:37.161 --> 00:43:38.780
their personal characteristics,

1701
00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:39.710
uh,

1702
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:41.090
in the kind of language,

1703
00:43:41.091 --> 00:43:42.020
the gesture,

1704
00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:44.390
the gestures and the lot power,

1705
00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:46.730
the discourse of strikes.

1706
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:51.350
And what about the 1890s and the first decade of the 20th century.

1707
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:53.210
It's transformed completely,

1708
00:43:53.211 --> 00:43:58.211
particularly in big factories because something has come along to change the way

1709
00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:02.750
people view their own work experience.

1710
00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:06.440
And this is called industrial discipline,

1711
00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:09.410
industrial discipline.

1712
00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:10.873
And this,

1713
00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:15.970
the strikes then the boss is often in Paris sending telegrams to the Moje saying

1714
00:44:18.111 --> 00:44:20.000
how they should deal.

1715
00:44:20.001 --> 00:44:21.410
They being the foreman,

1716
00:44:21.411 --> 00:44:23.330
deal with the workers.

1717
00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.270
He be kids become a symbol of capitalism,

1718
00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:31.690
defended by the army of the state in the of militant,

1719
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:32.730
uh,

1720
00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:37.730
send the Coulis militant union people who had the right after 1881 to organize.

1721
00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:41.100
He is a symbol of this,

1722
00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:46.490
the structure of a large scale industrialization that they can't control.

1723
00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.710
And he is off,

1724
00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:49.891
you know,

1725
00:44:49.891 --> 00:44:51.570
in the Chateaux on his boat.

1726
00:44:51.571 --> 00:44:53.250
And Normandy or something like that.

1727
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:54.510
But he has been,

1728
00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:59.720
the voice of him is now the foreman and the foreman enters the game and are,

1729
00:45:03.071 --> 00:45:03.990
is not the game,

1730
00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:04.770
uh,

1731
00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:09.770
but enters the workshop and he represents the intense to impose industrial

1732
00:45:11.071 --> 00:45:14.610
discipline on people whose parents or even them.

1733
00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:18.710
It always worked at home and you worked when it was light or you worked when you

1734
00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.160
had done nursing your baby,

1735
00:45:20.161 --> 00:45:24.330
then you worked and when you wanted to go for a stroll to have a smoke or have a

1736
00:45:24.331 --> 00:45:24.631
drink,

1737
00:45:24.631 --> 00:45:25.464
you did that.

1738
00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:30.210
But the foreman puts up up regulations that you will be fine.

1739
00:45:30.211 --> 00:45:31.470
If a plate is broken,

1740
00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:33.000
you'll be fine for chattering.

1741
00:45:33.001 --> 00:45:34.880
There was a horrible fire in Brooklyn.

1742
00:45:34.881 --> 00:45:35.520
They killed them.

1743
00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:40.230
140 women had been sort of locked in in about 1910 or 1911 because they were

1744
00:45:40.231 --> 00:45:40.861
chattering.

1745
00:45:40.861 --> 00:45:43.920
They're going out in the back to instead of working in talking and so they all

1746
00:45:43.921 --> 00:45:48.330
burned to death and the regulations told them that you will be fine if you do

1747
00:45:48.331 --> 00:45:48.511
this,

1748
00:45:48.511 --> 00:45:50.040
you'll be fired if you do this.

1749
00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:52.470
And the person that enforces them is the foreman.

1750
00:45:52.471 --> 00:45:57.471
The foreman is promoted from within or increasingly brought from the outside to

1751
00:45:57.541 --> 00:46:00.840
impose industrial discipline on these workers,

1752
00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:03.690
that Wedgewood pottery manufacturer.

1753
00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:04.740
Some of you heard of that.

1754
00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:08.370
He once said very prophetically in 1807 or 1808,

1755
00:46:08.371 --> 00:46:08.940
he said,

1756
00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:13.890
what I want to do is I want my workers to be like hands,

1757
00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:19.370
who move and who act and who react to the commands of my brain and they will do

1758
00:46:21.781 --> 00:46:23.280
what I want them to do.

1759
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:25.260
So the factory,

1760
00:46:25.261 --> 00:46:26.640
and this is in England too,

1761
00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:28.080
is you know,

1762
00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:29.700
if you can think of assembly lines,

1763
00:46:29.701 --> 00:46:30.620
I used to work at Kellogg,

1764
00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:31.470
so Battle Creek,

1765
00:46:31.471 --> 00:46:32.790
I did the raisin bran.

1766
00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:34.830
I put the raisins into snap,

1767
00:46:34.831 --> 00:46:36.570
pop into snack pack.

1768
00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:37.171
You know,

1769
00:46:37.171 --> 00:46:40.140
I did that and I worked at Ellis loves jams and jellies and Portland,

1770
00:46:40.141 --> 00:46:40.974
Oregon,

1771
00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:41.550
uh,

1772
00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:42.061
and all this.

1773
00:46:42.061 --> 00:46:43.080
And we hated the form.

1774
00:46:43.081 --> 00:46:44.430
And I'll tell you that we just hated them.

1775
00:46:44.431 --> 00:46:45.810
So at least I could hate them.

1776
00:46:45.811 --> 00:46:46.481
I hate them,

1777
00:46:46.481 --> 00:46:47.131
but I did hate them.

1778
00:46:47.131 --> 00:46:47.964
I'm sure I hated them.

1779
00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:48.331
Chris.

1780
00:46:48.331 --> 00:46:49.164
We hated them.

1781
00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:49.561
But you're,

1782
00:46:49.561 --> 00:46:52.200
but it's a format or the people who put the regulations up,

1783
00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:54.300
who punish you for trying to be yourself,

1784
00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:57.450
who trying to leave to see your friends.

1785
00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:58.740
And then the form.

1786
00:46:58.741 --> 00:47:02.580
They create these factories as a way of imposing industrial discipline when you

1787
00:47:02.581 --> 00:47:02.971
see,

1788
00:47:02.971 --> 00:47:06.270
and that's not the only reason cause you need factories for big machines.

1789
00:47:06.271 --> 00:47:06.751
These machines,

1790
00:47:06.751 --> 00:47:07.411
I can never forget it,

1791
00:47:07.411 --> 00:47:08.244
how to work them.

1792
00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:09.030
Uh,

1793
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.671
in a,

1794
00:47:09.671 --> 00:47:10.740
I worked in a canning plant,

1795
00:47:10.741 --> 00:47:11.191
I could never,

1796
00:47:11.191 --> 00:47:12.120
I suppose to work this machine,

1797
00:47:12.121 --> 00:47:13.290
I can never figure out how to work in.

1798
00:47:13.291 --> 00:47:15.570
It would get jammed all the time and I'd always get in trouble.

1799
00:47:15.571 --> 00:47:15.921
So that's me.

1800
00:47:15.921 --> 00:47:16.890
It is all coming out now.

1801
00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.780
But what they do is they create,

1802
00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:19.470
they create,

1803
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:21.840
when you have workers wanting to have their pictures taken,

1804
00:47:21.841 --> 00:47:22.800
when you have cameras,

1805
00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:23.540
you know,

1806
00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:25.680
and when they're taking their pictures together,

1807
00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:28.020
like a football team or like a baseball team,

1808
00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:31.330
they're always in front of the door of the factory.

1809
00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:32.973
Why?

1810
00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:37.450
Because they're very few doors and there's a clock over the door and is now the

1811
00:47:37.451 --> 00:47:37.961
clock.

1812
00:47:37.961 --> 00:47:40.390
It's the siren that tells you when you can come and go,

1813
00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:41.410
not when you're hungry.

1814
00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:41.681
Now,

1815
00:47:41.681 --> 00:47:43.030
when you're a baby needs to be nursed,

1816
00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:43.690
uh,

1817
00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:45.880
not when you just had to hear what breathing,

1818
00:47:45.881 --> 00:47:48.400
dust and know you're going to get TB and Croak from that,

1819
00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:49.150
uh,

1820
00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:50.170
in lots of places.

1821
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:53.830
And that's what imposes this industrial discipline,

1822
00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:54.100
uh,

1823
00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:54.933
comes from,

1824
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:55.181
uh,

1825
00:47:55.181 --> 00:47:55.451
you know,

1826
00:47:55.451 --> 00:47:55.971
from these,

1827
00:47:55.971 --> 00:47:56.241
these,

1828
00:47:56.241 --> 00:47:57.074
these foremen.

1829
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:59.470
And so strikes are often against form.

1830
00:47:59.471 --> 00:48:01.000
And there was a strike in the motion of women.

1831
00:48:01.001 --> 00:48:04.630
Workers were forced to kneel down and pray before the workday and they strike

1832
00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:07.040
against women form.

1833
00:48:07.041 --> 00:48:07.481
And to now,

1834
00:48:07.481 --> 00:48:08.770
not all of them were egregious,

1835
00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:09.730
but nonetheless,

1836
00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:11.500
this was a way of them,

1837
00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:12.070
you know,

1838
00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:13.510
of way of viewing.

1839
00:48:13.511 --> 00:48:18.511
Their experience was shaped by the necessity of being at one place at one time.

1840
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:20.260
And if you're not there,

1841
00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:21.133
see Ya,

1842
00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:22.300
that's the end of that.

1843
00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:22.961
Uh,

1844
00:48:22.961 --> 00:48:26.320
you better be there and imposed industrial discipline inside.

1845
00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:26.740
Uh,

1846
00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:27.461
the workplace.

1847
00:48:27.461 --> 00:48:30.520
I did a film for a documentary for,

1848
00:48:30.521 --> 00:48:30.810
um,

1849
00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:32.230
FTL trois on,

1850
00:48:32.231 --> 00:48:32.770
um,

1851
00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:33.131
on,

1852
00:48:33.131 --> 00:48:33.510
uh,

1853
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:34.180
uh,

1854
00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:34.861
on the Moje,

1855
00:48:34.861 --> 00:48:35.061
on the,

1856
00:48:35.061 --> 00:48:36.910
on the strikes in 1905.

1857
00:48:36.911 --> 00:48:38.530
And we did part of his 100 degrees,

1858
00:48:38.531 --> 00:48:39.610
literally this 41.

1859
00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:40.720
And we did it.

1860
00:48:40.721 --> 00:48:41.480
We did it in the,

1861
00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:46.030
in the ruins of the Hablan factory with dead pigeons and plates.

1862
00:48:46.031 --> 00:48:47.500
And the door wasn't there anymore.

1863
00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:48.760
But I'd seen it before.

1864
00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:53.170
And you could feel what it meant to these people if they had their pictures and

1865
00:48:53.171 --> 00:48:55.270
they said goodbye to comrades who had been fired,

1866
00:48:55.271 --> 00:48:56.890
who had been let go because there wasn't enough money,

1867
00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.270
it was pretty bad.

1868
00:48:58.450 --> 00:49:00.040
So the industrial discipline,

1869
00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:00.550
uh,

1870
00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:00.871
Jen,

1871
00:49:00.871 --> 00:49:01.180
you know,

1872
00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:03.700
it attempt to create this kind of perfect workforce.

1873
00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:07.900
What it does is it creates resentment and it helps explain,

1874
00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:08.300
uh,

1875
00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:09.131
there are other reasons too,

1876
00:49:09.131 --> 00:49:12.160
but this kind of mobilization of ordinary people.

1877
00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:15.700
Now let me just finish with the following story cause this is an amazing thing

1878
00:49:15.701 --> 00:49:17.290
in a few of you in other courses have heard this,

1879
00:49:17.291 --> 00:49:19.010
but I tell because it's just talk.

1880
00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:19.960
It was prophetic.

1881
00:49:19.961 --> 00:49:20.381
It was again,

1882
00:49:20.381 --> 00:49:22.870
this wonderful story and historian Michelle pit hole.

1883
00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:24.550
When she wrote an article,

1884
00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:25.920
I published it in a collection of essays.

1885
00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:26.860
Long time we will call the,

1886
00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:27.580
uh,

1887
00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:29.440
the three ages of industrial discipline.

1888
00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:31.240
And at court parallels the,

1889
00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:32.380
the view of the other,

1890
00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:33.130
uh,

1891
00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:34.060
where you know,

1892
00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:35.170
you're against,

1893
00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:36.070
uh,

1894
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:38.000
the guy's trying to pay the patrons,

1895
00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:39.170
trying to get you another potholes,

1896
00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:41.980
trying to get you to produce this plate and this,

1897
00:49:41.981 --> 00:49:44.080
this stuff and these shoes and all of that.

1898
00:49:44.081 --> 00:49:45.190
And then pretty soon as the form,

1899
00:49:45.191 --> 00:49:47.290
and it tells you how many things you're going to do.

1900
00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:48.041
But when,

1901
00:49:48.041 --> 00:49:53.041
what happens in the 1900 at a time when the Olympic start and you're counting

1902
00:49:53.411 --> 00:49:55.420
how far or restart,

1903
00:49:55.421 --> 00:49:59.200
how quickly you can run the hundred meters or whatever,

1904
00:49:59.350 --> 00:49:59.631
and they,

1905
00:49:59.631 --> 00:49:59.891
they,

1906
00:49:59.891 --> 00:50:00.120
uh,

1907
00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:05.120
an engineer called Taylor Taylorism and American comes up with a way of

1908
00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:10.480
measuring productivity by counting the units that you can produce you how many

1909
00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:11.200
little,

1910
00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:13.050
little God awful bags of a,

1911
00:50:13.051 --> 00:50:13.950
of a boxes of,

1912
00:50:13.951 --> 00:50:15.010
of raisin brand.

1913
00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:15.580
Uh,

1914
00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:15.791
you know,

1915
00:50:15.791 --> 00:50:16.840
could I produce in,

1916
00:50:16.841 --> 00:50:18.670
in so many hours and they count them.

1917
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.170
And if you don't count enough,

1918
00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:20.440
no,

1919
00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:21.280
you're out of there.

1920
00:50:21.281 --> 00:50:21.491
If you,

1921
00:50:21.491 --> 00:50:22.001
if you don't,

1922
00:50:22.001 --> 00:50:22.751
you don't have enough.

1923
00:50:22.751 --> 00:50:25.090
We weren't unionized and we couldn't be unionized them.

1924
00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:25.780
Uh,

1925
00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:26.710
you're out of there.

1926
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:27.830
And what happens,

1927
00:50:27.831 --> 00:50:28.101
you know,

1928
00:50:28.101 --> 00:50:30.260
that I know Taylorism becomes very important.

1929
00:50:30.261 --> 00:50:31.640
Ford loves Taylorism.

1930
00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:32.280
Uh,

1931
00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:32.510
and,

1932
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:35.750
and the car producers Renaud embraces Taylorism.

1933
00:50:35.751 --> 00:50:37.460
It's just an unbelievable thing.

1934
00:50:37.461 --> 00:50:40.970
And there's the one started going to a tailor or some French engineer comes to a

1935
00:50:40.971 --> 00:50:42.320
American company and says,

1936
00:50:42.321 --> 00:50:42.800
uh,

1937
00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:43.250
uh,

1938
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:43.450
well,

1939
00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:45.620
although all the workers or young here,

1940
00:50:45.621 --> 00:50:46.970
this was a tailor is in place.

1941
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:47.840
All the workers are young.

1942
00:50:47.841 --> 00:50:48.920
We're the old ones.

1943
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.521
He says,

1944
00:50:49.521 --> 00:50:50.001
come on along.

1945
00:50:50.001 --> 00:50:51.320
We'll have a smoke in the cemetery.

1946
00:50:51.321 --> 00:50:52.154
And you'll see,

1947
00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:57.700
and Michelle Po a said predicted in ne in 1978 that,

1948
00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.140
that the kind of surveillance or the kind of,

1949
00:51:00.141 --> 00:51:00.470
uh,

1950
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:04.160
the kind of counting of the assembly line production would give way to what she

1951
00:51:04.161 --> 00:51:06.500
called in an amazing thing.

1952
00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:10.880
I think about our postindustrial world of the cubicles of people answering phone

1953
00:51:10.881 --> 00:51:15.410
calls and doing computer line work will give ways the way you measure

1954
00:51:15.411 --> 00:51:19.910
performance and create industrial discipline will give way to what she called

1955
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:24.320
beautifully the quiet violence of the computer.

1956
00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:28.100
And it did see on Wednesday.
