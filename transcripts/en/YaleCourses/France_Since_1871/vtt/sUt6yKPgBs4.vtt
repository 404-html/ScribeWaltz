WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.063
Okay.

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.750
I'm going to talk about religion today.

3
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.093
Um,

4
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.170
yeah.

5
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:07.501
And,

6
00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:08.190
and what,

7
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.190
I'm going to first law talk just a little bit about people who weren't born into

8
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.470
the Catholic church.

9
00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:20.850
The vast majority of the population of France at the time in the course until

10
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.770
um,

11
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.640
until I say 1960,

12
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.863
um,

13
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.460
we're born a Catholic now whether they practice their religion is something will

14
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:30.460
come to a,

15
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.560
in a minute,

16
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.730
um,

17
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.120
of the percentage of the population of France who were Protestants,

18
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.650
um,

19
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.850
which I'll talk a little bit about minute.

20
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:40.020
It's about 5%.

21
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.900
The number of Jews I think chips,

22
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:44.520
Roi and tells you in his book,

23
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:47.190
but I think it's about 300,000.

24
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.830
Now.

25
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.830
First let me tell you where Protestants and Jews were for the most part and why.

26
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.800
Just to give you a sense of all this,

27
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.023
um,

28
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.170
the,

29
00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.680
the,

30
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.400
the reformation in the 16th century,

31
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.030
uh,

32
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.850
when it sort of Calvinism expands from,

33
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.110
from Geneva.

34
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.130
Um,

35
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.970
whereas you don't caravan I had considerable influence.

36
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.541
Uh,

37
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:14.670
it's spread really down,

38
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.181
uh,

39
00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:16.980
down the Rhone River.

40
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.031
I,

41
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:18.761
and it,

42
00:01:18.761 --> 00:01:23.761
it conquered large parts are found adepts in large parts of this part of France,

43
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:27.180
including Leone Leone was conquered,

44
00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:30.510
backed by the Catholic Church as they would consider it,

45
00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:31.980
the Catholic reformation,

46
00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:33.510
or it used to be called the counter reformation,

47
00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:34.770
but you don't call it that anymore.

48
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.610
Um,

49
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.360
but yet there were large sections of the south of France that remained

50
00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:43.890
Protestant and that still are just in case it ever pops up in a crossword

51
00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:44.610
puzzle.

52
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.701
Uh,

53
00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:47.400
the department with the largest number of Protestants,

54
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.960
something that's like a third,

55
00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:50.040
it's about what it was in the,

56
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.701
uh,

57
00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:54.030
in the 19th century is the gap,

58
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.570
the Ga rd,

59
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.190
uh,

60
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.240
that you would,

61
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.630
uh,

62
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.960
I've,

63
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.850
that's where Neem is the capital of it.

64
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.660
Um,

65
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.450
and the second is the Aldes shut a,

66
00:02:03.451 --> 00:02:03.751
r,

67
00:02:03.751 --> 00:02:04.141
d,

68
00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:04.441
e,

69
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:04.951
c,

70
00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:05.460
h,

71
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.270
e,

72
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.511
a,

73
00:02:06.511 --> 00:02:08.130
which is where we hang out.

74
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.443
Um,

75
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.000
they're also still and were Protestants,

76
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.420
uh,

77
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.010
in the vet river valleys.

78
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.450
We're coming down to the Rhone,

79
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:16.900
particularly in the department of the dome.

80
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.201
I mean,

81
00:02:17.201 --> 00:02:19.500
you don't have to remember all this information.

82
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.820
Lots of Protestants in Lohan and in El Sauce.

83
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.840
And of course that had been amputated in the next to Germany.

84
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.831
And you know,

85
00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:30.240
Protestant serve here and there,

86
00:02:30.241 --> 00:02:31.080
lots of Protestants,

87
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.550
uh,

88
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.180
when the edict of not that is,

89
00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:38.181
it gave toleration to Protestantism has revoked by Louis the 14th in 1685.

90
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.480
Uh,

91
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.880
lots of people tried to get out,

92
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.330
uh,

93
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.490
lots of Huguenots as they were called.

94
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.140
I went to Amsterdam,

95
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.810
to the pay Ba to Netherlands,

96
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.330
uh,

97
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.710
and lots try to go to Quebec in Canada because it would be,

98
00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:53.281
they slaughtered,

99
00:02:53.281 --> 00:02:54.780
be easier to practice their religion there,

100
00:02:54.781 --> 00:02:58.410
but many of them couldn't afford the passage and ended up living here in the

101
00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:01.240
Shank to they're in the shock Mary team in this area here.

102
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.650
The shot haunt for you.

103
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.030
That's the beautiful city,

104
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:06.200
Francis most beautiful city on the coast outside of [inaudible],

105
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.600
a La Rochelle,

106
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.230
uh,

107
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.090
the capital of the shrimp and met the team.

108
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.780
Um,

109
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.280
and then you have Protestants of course,

110
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.150
in,

111
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.920
in Paris and in some of the large,

112
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.311
uh,

113
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:16.120
cities.

114
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.211
Uh,

115
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:18.500
what happens is after the annexation of,

116
00:03:18.501 --> 00:03:20.350
of Alsace and much of lower end by,

117
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.161
uh,

118
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:22.480
by the German empire,

119
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.900
uh,

120
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.670
many of the Protestants in,

121
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.870
in l I'll sauce and some in little hen moved,

122
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.530
uh,

123
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.363
many move to,

124
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.240
to better for,

125
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.630
uh,

126
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.960
which it became a territory because of they're not a department because of their

127
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:38.950
heroic defense of bell for by a general during the Franco Prussian war.

128
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.970
So there are your,

129
00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:43.210
your main centers of Protestantism.

130
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.020
Now what about Jews who get right during the French Revolution,

131
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:50.740
the first synagogue,

132
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.401
uh,

133
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:52.540
in France,

134
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:52.931
which is,

135
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:53.140
you know,

136
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.520
routinely targeted by,

137
00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:54.760
you know,

138
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.590
vicious graffiti and this sort of thing,

139
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:57.071
uh,

140
00:03:57.071 --> 00:04:00.980
is in the Volcker lose that as they pop them all of Avignon a place called a

141
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:01.950
Coffee Cup and saucer competence.

142
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.800
You can see either say either we're trusts usually and a cup and costumes.

143
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.170
And the other side of the Rhone,

144
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.580
I you have large concentrations of Jews and Sephardic Jews in Boldo,

145
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.080
uh,

146
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.350
and in Paris and in Alsace and Lorraine were there,

147
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:20.320
had been really vigorous and vicious antisemitic riots,

148
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.861
uh,

149
00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:24.850
after the revolution of 1848.

150
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.110
And in Alsace,

151
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.010
interestingly enough,

152
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:28.870
the three religions that as the Catholics,

153
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:32.440
the Protestants and the Jews tried to outdo each other in charity.

154
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:36.490
They said it really remarkable kind of voluntary associations to help up poor

155
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:37.324
people.

156
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.110
Um,

157
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.771
and uh,

158
00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:38.991
you know,

159
00:04:38.991 --> 00:04:41.710
as for one interesting sort of aspect of it.

160
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.390
So that's just a sort of overview,

161
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:45.160
but the vast majority of the population,

162
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.280
we're born in to the Catholic church now because of the role of the church in

163
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:54.910
the counterrevolution of the great French Revolution.

164
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.140
And because of the close attachment of the Catholic church to monitor,

165
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.000
to,

166
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.250
to,

167
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.031
to uh,

168
00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:01.750
the monarch,

169
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.460
to the monarchy that his support for the ill fated Quanta Shamba Henry the fifth

170
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.570
and all of that.

171
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.490
You have this tension,

172
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.910
uh,

173
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.910
between the Catholic Church as a public institution and,

174
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.360
uh,

175
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.550
an increasingly powerful state.

176
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.210
Now one differentiation that you should make.

177
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.530
Eye is a between D Christianization,

178
00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:29.830
which I'm going to talk about and anti clericalism.

179
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.570
Now,

180
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.403
Voltaire,

181
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.000
the great philosophic,

182
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.320
he once said,

183
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.210
crush the awful thing and he didn't mean religion itself.

184
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.420
What he met with the public institutional role of the Catholic Church and he

185
00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:46.720
was,

186
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.360
became the ultimate sort of symbol of,

187
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.580
of anti clericalism.

188
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:55.600
Anti clericalism wasn't necessarily antilope religiosity.

189
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:56.650
What it was was,

190
00:05:56.651 --> 00:06:01.651
was against the public role institutional role of the Catholic church in

191
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:03.944
politics,

192
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.010
Vus in French cities in the 1850,

193
00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.390
the 1880s and nineties.

194
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.810
There are literally battles over urban space where lay,

195
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.291
lay,

196
00:06:17.291 --> 00:06:22.291
assize secularized and anticlerical municipalities want to refuse the rights of

197
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.530
uh,

198
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.520
or the right of cat,

199
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.900
the Catholic Church to stage processions of relics,

200
00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:30.800
for example,

201
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.580
on,

202
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.900
on feast days in the most,

203
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.440
which became Levine,

204
00:06:35.441 --> 00:06:36.170
who's a,

205
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.381
you know,

206
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:37.040
a red,

207
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.210
the red city.

208
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.781
Uh,

209
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:40.880
it had once been a very religious town,

210
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:42.980
but they still have this every seven years.

211
00:06:42.981 --> 00:06:45.410
They still do these perceptions where they haul state,

212
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:45.980
uh,

213
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.260
saints relics through the streets.

214
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.331
And so the Mississippi [inaudible],

215
00:06:49.331 --> 00:06:49.641
they said,

216
00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:49.821
no,

217
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:54.821
you can't do that because that is violating the neutrality of public space.

218
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:55.881
And so that's,

219
00:06:55.881 --> 00:07:00.881
you have this big bigeye he got this big brawl between a church and,

220
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:01.521
you know,

221
00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:06.521
lay a sizing secularizing municipalities influenced by,

222
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:07.880
by socialism,

223
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:08.580
uh,

224
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.460
and not necessarily against religion,

225
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.010
but against the public role of,

226
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.140
of the Catholic Church.

227
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:16.730
And so that's kind of,

228
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:17.151
you know,

229
00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:21.290
a background go for all of that.

230
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.933
Now.

231
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.530
It used to be maybe 80 years ago,

232
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.360
no less than that,

233
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:31.400
maybe 50 years ago,

234
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:32.660
that,

235
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.170
um,

236
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.740
one of the,

237
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:34.030
the,

238
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:34.530
the,

239
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:39.530
the interpretations of the French Revolution and the impact of the French

240
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.150
revolution and the empire,

241
00:07:41.151 --> 00:07:43.320
the first empire that is an one Napoleon,

242
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:47.690
the first who made peace with the church was that it was the revolution that

243
00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:49.430
destroyed that old time religion.

244
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.070
And in 1815 when Louie the 18th,

245
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.490
before this course cranks up,

246
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:56.450
comes back.

247
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.710
Um,

248
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:58.490
he,

249
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.190
he espouses the view that,

250
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:01.431
that,

251
00:08:01.431 --> 00:08:01.641
that,

252
00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:01.820
that,

253
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:02.510
that,

254
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.190
that church people had,

255
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.990
that the revolution,

256
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:06.500
uh,

257
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.910
had been created by people like,

258
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:08.121
Ooh,

259
00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:08.954
so,

260
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.960
and Voltaire and that they had been responsible for moving France away from that

261
00:08:15.591 --> 00:08:16.820
old time religion.

262
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.630
And as I said the other day after 1815,

263
00:08:20.631 --> 00:08:21.760
there's a revival of,

264
00:08:21.761 --> 00:08:24.740
of intense religiosity in some regions.

265
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.810
You find the same thing in,

266
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.410
uh,

267
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:28.040
uh,

268
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.480
in the 1870s,

269
00:08:29.481 --> 00:08:29.811
again,

270
00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:31.550
the Republic of the moral order.

271
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.850
And so that's what the church wanted people to believe.

272
00:08:34.851 --> 00:08:36.950
And many historians believe that as well.

273
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.720
But along came a historian called Michelle Vavera,

274
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.130
v O.

275
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.280
V e l l e used to be the professor of the French Revolution in the Sorbonne.

276
00:08:46.281 --> 00:08:47.270
And he's kind of a friend of mine,

277
00:08:47.271 --> 00:08:48.680
or at least a good of Quinton's,

278
00:08:48.681 --> 00:08:50.000
a very old dude now.

279
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.080
Um,

280
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:56.080
and Volvo was interested to see whether that old time religion was a already

281
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:02.870
crumbling or in decline before the French revolution.

282
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:08.630
And so he started asking just how effective was the counter reformation or the

283
00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:13.590
Catholic reformation,

284
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.670
if you will,

285
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:20.180
in bringing back reviving that broke piety of a religion,

286
00:09:20.341 --> 00:09:21.270
of faith,

287
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:26.930
of religion in paintings of swooning cupid's of intense religious belief.

288
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.520
And what he discovered was that in the parts of France that he looked at that

289
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:38.910
that old time religion was already waning.

290
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.460
And thus we come to the concept which is important for this course.

291
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:49.730
And just in general of d Christianization and d Christianization means two

292
00:09:53.461 --> 00:09:54.294
things.

293
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.051
First,

294
00:09:55.051 --> 00:09:55.351
again,

295
00:09:55.351 --> 00:09:56.340
before this course,

296
00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:01.610
it meant the campaign against the church has a public institution and really

297
00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:05.550
against organized religion undertaken by a,

298
00:10:05.551 --> 00:10:06.510
during the terror,

299
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.750
by Robespierre and the others.

300
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.510
It meant melting down church bills.

301
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.970
It Ma admit meaning that,

302
00:10:14.971 --> 00:10:19.971
that only priests who swore allegiance to the French revolution to the nation

303
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:21.300
could say mass.

304
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.160
And pretty soon putting them under pressure,

305
00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:24.540
not to say mass at all,

306
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:26.610
but that's not what we're talking about.

307
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:27.990
The residuals,

308
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:31.500
the remnants of that are still important in the period where we're discussing.

309
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:33.390
But what Volvo Bell,

310
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.040
whose name I should write on the board,

311
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:35.581
uh,

312
00:10:35.581 --> 00:10:38.070
in a book called broke piety and d Christianization,

313
00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:40.220
which is looking at part of,

314
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.340
of uh,

315
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.130
privas started with that.

316
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:49.580
What he had meant was that decline in religious practice.

317
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.440
Now it's very hard.

318
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.490
And before imagine you're in a store and that's what you are in this course.

319
00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:01.820
How are you going to prove whether religion has that has still an important role

320
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:08.060
in the individual person or in family life or in public life?

321
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.160
If you're looking along time ago,

322
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.540
how are you going to know that in a society in which in the,

323
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.040
in the 18th century,

324
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:17.460
uh,

325
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:22.460
the majority of people could not read and write and in which the only things

326
00:11:23.461 --> 00:11:28.461
about religion that you could read were reports written by or sermons written

327
00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:29.701
by,

328
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:34.701
published by bishops and archbishops or reports sent by those delegates of

329
00:11:37.891 --> 00:11:41.100
bishops and archbishops going around France.

330
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:41.570
Uh,

331
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:42.450
I were going around there,

332
00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:44.550
their diocese to see how many,

333
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:45.190
uh,

334
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.070
and what the state of religion was.

335
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.390
How do you do that?

336
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.400
How do you know what,

337
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:50.940
you know,

338
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.500
whether people went to church or not,

339
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.640
how do you know that?

340
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.150
And so what he did was the following the,

341
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.010
and this was talking about tough work,

342
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:00.880
uh,

343
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.530
that their ways of doing this.

344
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:03.100
Uh,

345
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.670
let me just give you a couple of,

346
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:05.291
for example,

347
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:07.390
I don't know how some of you raised Catholic.

348
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:08.800
I was raised Catholic.

349
00:12:08.801 --> 00:12:12.430
I was once thrown out of a religion class and paddled [inaudible] Jesuit high

350
00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:13.121
school in Portland,

351
00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:13.750
Oregon.

352
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.960
Uh,

353
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.411
because,

354
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:14.540
uh,

355
00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.760
the guy had messed up the Thomas Aquinas's proofs of the existence of God.

356
00:12:18.761 --> 00:12:19.211
And I thought,

357
00:12:19.211 --> 00:12:20.950
I thought it was a smart ass.

358
00:12:20.951 --> 00:12:23.170
I could prove that God couldn't exist by what he'd done.

359
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:23.990
And so they,

360
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.440
they threw me out of religion class.

361
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:26.980
Uh,

362
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:27.161
uh,

363
00:12:27.161 --> 00:12:27.910
but you know,

364
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.690
so I don't know if that would be a statistic in,

365
00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:29.831
in,

366
00:12:29.831 --> 00:12:30.070
in,

367
00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:31.510
in this kind of evolution,

368
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.100
but basically what,

369
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.641
uh,

370
00:12:33.641 --> 00:12:34.870
in the Catholic Church,

371
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.470
uh,

372
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:37.130
babies ha have had to be,

373
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.990
I don't know if it's still the case,

374
00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:39.130
but it had to be baptized,

375
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:39.521
uh,

376
00:12:39.521 --> 00:12:41.740
within the first three days of birth.

377
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.120
Just thus all these,

378
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.650
these certificates that have,

379
00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:47.020
remember that the act of Tim One oz where people say,

380
00:12:47.021 --> 00:12:47.320
I,

381
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.460
I see this baby.

382
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:53.140
The baby is alive and they baptize the baby if the baby dies and member babies

383
00:12:53.141 --> 00:12:54.160
died all the time.

384
00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:54.641
I,

385
00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:55.600
after childbirth,

386
00:12:55.601 --> 00:12:56.950
if you've made it to one year,

387
00:12:56.951 --> 00:12:57.371
one,

388
00:12:57.371 --> 00:12:59.770
you had a good chance of living to the ripe old age of 40,

389
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:00.790
uh,

390
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:01.270
uh,

391
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:01.661
that,

392
00:13:01.661 --> 00:13:01.931
that,

393
00:13:01.931 --> 00:13:02.141
you know,

394
00:13:02.141 --> 00:13:03.310
if you didn't baptize the baby,

395
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:04.570
the baby died and the baby,

396
00:13:04.571 --> 00:13:05.000
you know,

397
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:05.200
uh,

398
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.740
was going to go to limbo or something sort of float around all these,

399
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.610
these popular beliefs of a,

400
00:13:10.611 --> 00:13:11.680
about limbo.

401
00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:16.070
And so what he did is he went out and he looked at all of these baptism

402
00:13:16.071 --> 00:13:17.350
certificates of baptism,

403
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:21.310
SoundLens of them to see how long it was that,

404
00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:21.850
you know,

405
00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:25.960
how long did people back to after the birth that they baptize their children.

406
00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.780
And now people had already started thinking about that.

407
00:13:28.781 --> 00:13:33.781
The first religious sociologists were priests at the end of the 19th century who

408
00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:34.990
said,

409
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.610
people don't go to church anymore.

410
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.140
Why not?

411
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:38.571
And so they,

412
00:13:38.571 --> 00:13:40.900
they went out and they began to effect one of the people who people,

413
00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:42.970
people whose work I most admire is an old,

414
00:13:42.971 --> 00:13:43.451
very old,

415
00:13:43.451 --> 00:13:47.620
it must be 110 and we literally 90 a priestly most who used to go out and look

416
00:13:47.621 --> 00:13:51.970
in the cemeteries to see what people had written on tombs.

417
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.790
And he looked at the names that people named babies.

418
00:13:54.791 --> 00:13:56.050
More about that in a minute.

419
00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.970
So what Volvo found in what subsequent historians of religion have found are,

420
00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:01.600
are that,

421
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:01.781
you know,

422
00:14:01.781 --> 00:14:03.370
the curve goes something like this,

423
00:14:03.371 --> 00:14:03.551
you know,

424
00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:04.570
three days to,

425
00:14:04.571 --> 00:14:05.404
you know,

426
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.600
a month to two months to six months.

427
00:14:07.601 --> 00:14:08.680
And in the 19th century,

428
00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:10.300
increasingly in parts of France,

429
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:11.403
that's key.

430
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:12.303
Never.

431
00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:13.180
Um,

432
00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.830
and then there are other things you could do when people of means died.

433
00:14:16.831 --> 00:14:18.400
They left wills in,

434
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:20.320
in 1830s in Paris,

435
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:24.460
75% of the population left nothing to nobody because he had nothing to leave

436
00:14:24.461 --> 00:14:27.130
anybody and they couldn't afford to have anybody drop a will.

437
00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.790
They couldn't afford a lawyer or a notary to draw up a will.

438
00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.670
So what Volvo found was that,

439
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.200
that where people had,

440
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.650
you know,

441
00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:36.010
had,

442
00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:39.730
or in earlier times at the height of the counter reformation or the Catholic

443
00:14:39.731 --> 00:14:41.440
reformation in the 17th century,

444
00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:46.560
they had left money to have masses said for their souls or they'd left money to

445
00:14:47.621 --> 00:14:49.750
Catholic institutions.

446
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:50.111
Uh,

447
00:14:50.111 --> 00:14:53.630
carrying four lepers are caring for other sick people,

448
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:54.380
uh,

449
00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.970
or foundling homes.

450
00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:00.650
And increasingly they stopped doing that in the areas that he looked at and they

451
00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:05.651
started leaving money to lay associations or to somebody else,

452
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:07.221
you know,

453
00:15:07.221 --> 00:15:08.790
to their uncle or their children.

454
00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.120
I no longer,

455
00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:10.490
you know,

456
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:15.490
150 masses said on their anniversary or their birthday for the repose of their

457
00:15:17.091 --> 00:15:18.050
mortal soul.

458
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.330
And then you can look at religious vocation.

459
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:21.290
I,

460
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.930
there are parts of France that have always had a lot of priests.

461
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:25.303
Um,

462
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.063
if you needs to have,

463
00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:27.720
uh,

464
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.190
uh,

465
00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:29.000
Brittany,

466
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:29.300
uh,

467
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.081
for one example,

468
00:15:30.081 --> 00:15:31.040
but so you could look,

469
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:35.120
and what he discovered was that the number of people going into the clergy,

470
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:40.210
men and women declined rapidly in the parts of Provence that he looked at.

471
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:41.840
Now that's a good sign.

472
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.250
What about names?

473
00:15:43.251 --> 00:15:44.001
There's another one.

474
00:15:44.001 --> 00:15:44.151
I mean,

475
00:15:44.151 --> 00:15:45.590
this is a talk about boring work,

476
00:15:45.591 --> 00:15:47.870
but this is what this guy normally most did.

477
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.770
Um,

478
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:49.610
you can,

479
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.010
when people start naming their babies,

480
00:15:52.011 --> 00:15:54.320
when they stopped naming them after saints,

481
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.940
that tells you something.

482
00:15:55.941 --> 00:15:56.451
For example,

483
00:15:56.451 --> 00:15:56.961
in the limousine,

484
00:15:56.961 --> 00:15:58.100
and this is an example,

485
00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.180
but in the Leemoo Zack,

486
00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:02.120
you know that the saints that were big time saints there,

487
00:16:02.121 --> 00:16:02.871
one is a Leo.

488
00:16:02.871 --> 00:16:03.320
Nah,

489
00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.920
like Leonard and another was a [inaudible].

490
00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.250
The name Must Yada.

491
00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:11.240
And so this guy I looked in and people stop naming their children [inaudible]

492
00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.160
and Leonard Leo now and,

493
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:13.471
and the,

494
00:16:13.471 --> 00:16:13.791
and that,

495
00:16:13.791 --> 00:16:13.941
you know,

496
00:16:13.941 --> 00:16:15.230
that tells you something too.

497
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.080
Or I mean a more obvious one would be women's names.

498
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.980
Uh,

499
00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:19.491
you made,

500
00:16:19.491 --> 00:16:20.360
but you probably don't know.

501
00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:21.620
People named Mary Magdalen.

502
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:22.790
Uh,

503
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:23.160
and,

504
00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.070
and during the French Revolution,

505
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:28.070
a lot of people took the old Roman names and he started naming their babies and

506
00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:29.990
things like [inaudible] and names like that.

507
00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.320
But you can look a,

508
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:32.630
you don't know what even named Graca us.

509
00:16:32.631 --> 00:16:33.020
I bet.

510
00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:33.770
But you can,

511
00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:34.100
uh,

512
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:34.311
you know,

513
00:16:34.311 --> 00:16:35.390
this was another way that,

514
00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:36.500
that you could do it.

515
00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:40.160
And there's other ways to remember I said that one of the published sources you

516
00:16:40.161 --> 00:16:45.161
can actually read a are these bishops sermons because they were published every

517
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:46.933
year.

518
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.130
And when these bishops sermons,

519
00:16:49.131 --> 00:16:52.760
and I'm talking more about the 19th century when they talked to start talking

520
00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:55.340
about the dark secrets,

521
00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:59.840
what are the dark secrets at a time of plunging birth rate,

522
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.340
birth control,

523
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.983
birth control.

524
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:04.850
And that tells you something in a way,

525
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.380
very indirectly as well.

526
00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.100
And what about even going to mass in the Catholic Church?

527
00:17:10.101 --> 00:17:13.730
You're supposed to go to mass on Sundays and you're certainly supposed to go to

528
00:17:13.731 --> 00:17:15.350
mass and confession,

529
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:16.370
uh,

530
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.170
on Easter at Easter time.

531
00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:21.650
And so that's one of the things they had the priest count up.

532
00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:24.460
They would count people and,

533
00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.550
and uh,

534
00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.640
who were in the church and what you had is again,

535
00:17:28.641 --> 00:17:32.360
in astonishing decline of the number of people going to church.

536
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.680
Just an aside,

537
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.360
because I worked with a sociologist and the first thing I,

538
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.410
I didn't have a job when you're first year after I finished my degree.

539
00:17:39.411 --> 00:17:41.690
You know what Michigan Mighty Michigan maize and blue forever.

540
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:42.200
Uh,

541
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:42.491
uh,

542
00:17:42.491 --> 00:17:43.880
I taught sociology.

543
00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:44.601
Uh,

544
00:17:44.601 --> 00:17:46.580
and so I was used to counting things.

545
00:17:46.581 --> 00:17:47.001
You know,

546
00:17:47.001 --> 00:17:48.890
I worked out with a great sociologist called Charles.

547
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:50.483
And so one day,

548
00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:54.000
cause I was writing a book about our religion and uh,

549
00:17:54.001 --> 00:17:56.130
with my daughter then who was about 11,

550
00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:56.671
I,

551
00:17:56.671 --> 00:18:00.630
we heard the bells ring for church and there's only a mass about every six

552
00:18:00.631 --> 00:18:01.410
weeks.

553
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:02.730
More about that later.

554
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:03.511
And I said,

555
00:18:03.511 --> 00:18:03.601
well,

556
00:18:03.601 --> 00:18:06.030
let's go up and count the number of people in Church.

557
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:07.330
So,

558
00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:12.000
and there's a huge gap between men and women in a church attendance.

559
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.590
It was true in the 19th century,

560
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:14.640
and it's true now.

561
00:18:14.641 --> 00:18:19.260
So we go to the back of this church and we start counting the number of people

562
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.800
and there were 18 people and my daughter,

563
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:23.431
then 11,

564
00:18:23.431 --> 00:18:24.264
all of us and said,

565
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:28.160
may the fom sown Shoaff even the,

566
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:29.610
even the women are bald.

567
00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:32.310
And of course then everybody in the church turned around and looked at us

568
00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:33.360
standing in the back.

569
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:33.840
Uh,

570
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.940
and she had an accrual point there.

571
00:18:35.941 --> 00:18:37.020
She didn't mean to be cruel,

572
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:41.400
but it was at most of the people who went to church were very old ladies.

573
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:42.030
Uh,

574
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.750
but the priest even now and this particular village does not have a regular

575
00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:47.640
priests and has not had for decades.

576
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.610
They count the number of people who are there on Easter.

577
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:54.360
And what you had is this precipitous decline in,

578
00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:55.110
uh,

579
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.420
in the number of people going to church.

580
00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.640
So that is deep Christianization.

581
00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:04.730
Let me give you another example from World War One war memorials.

582
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.090
Many of you have had my friend.

583
00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:09.450
Some of you may have had my friend Jay winters course and he works at his,

584
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.130
done a lot of work on war memorials.

585
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.890
And if you go to parts of France that were very Christianized,

586
00:19:13.891 --> 00:19:14.850
more about this later,

587
00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:15.863
if you go to the,

588
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.700
to the [inaudible] are up here to the end,

589
00:19:17.701 --> 00:19:19.860
the Africa here or the Rda,

590
00:19:19.861 --> 00:19:24.510
those are classic examples of very Christianized parts of France.

591
00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:28.650
Even the war memorials were in some places where you practiced religion,

592
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:29.401
the warm,

593
00:19:29.401 --> 00:19:34.401
the number of the monument to the dead will be near the church in some of those

594
00:19:34.411 --> 00:19:34.891
places.

595
00:19:34.891 --> 00:19:39.060
The monument to the dad is not only not near the church that no one goes to,

596
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:44.420
but we'll have a broken cross asking that same question that Voltaire went to

597
00:19:44.521 --> 00:19:46.680
ask about that Lisbon earthquake.

598
00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.450
If there was a god,

599
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:53.880
how could he or she have allowed this to happen?

600
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.140
And even those monuments are symbols of,

601
00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.273
of,

602
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.810
of uh,

603
00:20:00.811 --> 00:20:05.811
of a decline in what had been assumed by the church and indeed assumed by the

604
00:20:06.271 --> 00:20:10.410
state of that old time religion.

605
00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:14.730
But now is this true everywhere?

606
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:15.540
Well,

607
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.080
no,

608
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:16.980
not at all.

609
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.930
And that's one of the points.

610
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.480
And that's one of the reasons that I insisted.

611
00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:21.121
If you don't have one,

612
00:20:21.121 --> 00:20:22.350
please come up and get one later.

613
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.570
Those handy little maps with the regions and they did it,

614
00:20:25.571 --> 00:20:30.571
pop them all because there are huge differences and these differences were

615
00:20:30.871 --> 00:20:31.740
already apparent.

616
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:32.640
Uh,

617
00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.390
in,

618
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:33.541
uh,

619
00:20:33.541 --> 00:20:34.560
18th century.

620
00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:39.450
The French Revolution was above all the civil war,

621
00:20:39.451 --> 00:20:41.130
a war about religion.

622
00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:46.470
And if you take a map from 1789 or 1790,

623
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.943
90,

624
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.480
when the priest had to either swear to the nation to the French revolution or

625
00:20:52.481 --> 00:20:56.800
refuse to swear to the revolution and to the nation,

626
00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:00.160
and you take that map and you put it along a map of the elections of,

627
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.530
of May,

628
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:06.460
1849 and you put that on top of a map of the election of phosphor meeting hall

629
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.070
as President of France of 1981.

630
00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:13.450
They're are almost the same with very few changes.

631
00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:15.550
And one of the predictors here,

632
00:21:15.551 --> 00:21:16.630
I sound like a sociologist,

633
00:21:16.631 --> 00:21:17.464
which I am not,

634
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:22.560
but one of the predictors of all of that is the Christianization because the

635
00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:28.081
regions of political conservatism are the regions in which that old time

636
00:21:28.481 --> 00:21:33.481
religion was in which those reasons were less d Christianized than other places.

637
00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.680
So where were the d Christianized,

638
00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:37.150
uh,

639
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:37.870
regions?

640
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:41.710
Where were the religions of the areas of still intense religious practice?

641
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:42.783
Just for the hell of it.

642
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.960
Uh,

643
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:44.141
oh,

644
00:21:44.141 --> 00:21:45.310
Vanya again.

645
00:21:45.311 --> 00:21:45.461
Oh,

646
00:21:45.461 --> 00:21:45.830
van.

647
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:46.031
Yeah,

648
00:21:46.031 --> 00:21:46.960
that's a region you shouldn't,

649
00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:47.590
you know,

650
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:50.470
you should at least know something about if you like astronomy,

651
00:21:50.471 --> 00:21:51.160
you'll think of Audi,

652
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.950
go fabulous garlic with potatoes or your,

653
00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:54.881
you'll think of a,

654
00:21:54.881 --> 00:21:55.091
you know,

655
00:21:55.091 --> 00:21:55.990
stuffed cabbage,

656
00:21:55.991 --> 00:21:57.010
I think of all sorts of stuff.

657
00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:57.730
Uh,

658
00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:58.180
but,

659
00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:58.391
uh,

660
00:21:58.391 --> 00:21:59.290
that's not what we're talking about.

661
00:21:59.440 --> 00:21:59.820
Uh,

662
00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:00.990
in Ovaria,

663
00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:01.810
uh,

664
00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.540
you still have intense religiosity.

665
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.770
We had a have friends who wants to own a cafe across from the national archives

666
00:22:08.771 --> 00:22:11.650
where I spend quite a lot of time in both institutions.

667
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.520
Um,

668
00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.360
and they,

669
00:22:13.361 --> 00:22:13.631
uh,

670
00:22:13.631 --> 00:22:15.220
the wife was from the Avian Wall,

671
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:16.570
which is way down here,

672
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.680
Mijo and all of that.

673
00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:18.460
Uh,

674
00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:20.200
and the husband is from contact,

675
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:22.510
which is a pure or Yak there.

676
00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:26.680
And they had 13 and 12 brothers and sisters respectively,

677
00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:32.220
born in abject misery in the 1930s just misery classic.

678
00:22:34.271 --> 00:22:35.830
Some of the babies died,

679
00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.450
but that's a lot of children.

680
00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.430
Now if you compare that,

681
00:22:39.431 --> 00:22:40.091
if you go about,

682
00:22:40.091 --> 00:22:42.220
if you want to drive about not even a day,

683
00:22:42.221 --> 00:22:44.400
you get down here near Isiah,

684
00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:44.851
uh,

685
00:22:44.851 --> 00:22:48.820
the prune capital of France and one of the rugby capitols of France.

686
00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:49.660
Uh,

687
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.460
it was sad and it was true that if,

688
00:22:51.461 --> 00:22:52.510
and I mentioned this the first day,

689
00:22:52.511 --> 00:22:54.310
I think that if you had more,

690
00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:57.070
if you had a second child in some villages,

691
00:22:57.071 --> 00:22:59.050
you received a condolence card,

692
00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:00.910
a condolence card.

693
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:02.890
Now how different that is,

694
00:23:02.891 --> 00:23:03.880
and those are places don't know,

695
00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:05.080
aren't very far away.

696
00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:05.890
Well,

697
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:09.280
the look they go on down here is extremely Decriss tonight,

698
00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:10.481
whereas,

699
00:23:10.481 --> 00:23:10.601
oh,

700
00:23:10.601 --> 00:23:11.021
van,

701
00:23:11.021 --> 00:23:11.530
you know,

702
00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:16.530
one of the things the Catholic Church said was no dark secrets baby and have

703
00:23:17.381 --> 00:23:22.381
lots of children and some the younger ones into the clergy as sisters and nuns

704
00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:23.734
and that sort of stuff.

705
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:24.611
Uh,

706
00:23:24.611 --> 00:23:28.030
other areas of religious practice in El Sauce,

707
00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:28.893
Catholics,

708
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:33.550
Protestants and Jews all practice their religion very faithfully in the north of

709
00:23:33.551 --> 00:23:33.941
France,

710
00:23:33.941 --> 00:23:36.280
particularly in the Flemish parts of the north.

711
00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.510
That old time religion was still practiced in much of Normandy.

712
00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:42.190
The same thing though,

713
00:23:42.191 --> 00:23:43.090
not in big cities,

714
00:23:43.091 --> 00:23:43.511
less than,

715
00:23:43.511 --> 00:23:45.010
less than Raul for example.

716
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.070
And in Brittany,

717
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:46.671
uh,

718
00:23:46.671 --> 00:23:47.570
above all,

719
00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:48.200
uh,

720
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.160
religion was practiced as it always had been.

721
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:55.760
And there were huge numbers of people going on if they call them Brittany,

722
00:23:55.761 --> 00:23:56.511
the pardons,

723
00:23:56.511 --> 00:23:57.170
which are,

724
00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:57.711
which are,

725
00:23:57.711 --> 00:23:58.100
you know,

726
00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:01.070
religious ceremonies full of festivity as well.

727
00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:01.701
Now,

728
00:24:01.701 --> 00:24:03.770
what are the big D Christianized areas?

729
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:05.810
Almost any large city,

730
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:06.830
even in the case of,

731
00:24:06.831 --> 00:24:10.610
of Brittany breasts because it had so many sailors who weren't from Brittany.

732
00:24:10.611 --> 00:24:13.040
There are though a lot of Britain's were sailors also,

733
00:24:13.041 --> 00:24:13.820
for example,

734
00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:14.571
in life are,

735
00:24:14.571 --> 00:24:16.290
there are lots of buttons live in La.

736
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:16.701
But anyway,

737
00:24:16.701 --> 00:24:16.910
that's,

738
00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:18.470
it makes things more complicated than they are.

739
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:19.603
Um,

740
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:20.090
uh,

741
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:21.200
most big cities,

742
00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:22.100
some exceptions.

743
00:24:22.101 --> 00:24:23.570
Lele is still fairly,

744
00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:24.290
uh,

745
00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:25.820
practicing a Catholic,

746
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:26.270
uh,

747
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:27.020
uh,

748
00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.240
Paris totally lost to the church.

749
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:29.991
One of the things,

750
00:24:29.991 --> 00:24:30.350
if you'll,

751
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:31.850
if you go to the suburbs of Paris,

752
00:24:31.851 --> 00:24:34.490
even the inner suburbs that were annexed in 1860,

753
00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:38.750
you'll see all of these extremely modest and sometimes just impossibly ugly

754
00:24:38.751 --> 00:24:43.751
churches that were built in the 1870s to try to reconquer the pie,

755
00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:48.740
the working class population that had been lost in the working class suburbs to

756
00:24:48.741 --> 00:24:50.860
the Catholic Church sock record,

757
00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:53.420
which I've already denounced because of his art architecture.

758
00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:54.170
Uh,

759
00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:54.620
uh,

760
00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:54.821
you know,

761
00:24:54.821 --> 00:24:57.140
standing on my match for the beauty of Beaut,

762
00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:01.250
beaut of Mamacita was there as a sign of pennants because of,

763
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:02.990
of the Franco Prussian war,

764
00:25:02.991 --> 00:25:07.991
but the cities were basically lost to the Catholic church with some exceptions,

765
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:10.220
but so we're huge regions.

766
00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.030
Uh,

767
00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:11.460
the,

768
00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:12.200
the false,

769
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.240
the area around Paris here,

770
00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.550
the eating of the false as this call because you can imagine,

771
00:25:17.551 --> 00:25:20.120
and it's kind of vaguely as an island because of all these rivers,

772
00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:20.660
uh,

773
00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:25.660
extremely deep Christianize the Leemoo that around the Moje totally the

774
00:25:25.731 --> 00:25:27.470
Christianized to southwest.

775
00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.640
Absolutely.

776
00:25:28.641 --> 00:25:29.570
I forgot to mention that we're,

777
00:25:29.571 --> 00:25:30.650
Bernadette have lured,

778
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:31.790
saw the Virgin Mary,

779
00:25:31.791 --> 00:25:35.330
that that part of the Pyrenees was still very Christianized prevalence,

780
00:25:35.331 --> 00:25:36.470
much of provost,

781
00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:36.890
uh,

782
00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:37.550
very,

783
00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:37.671
uh,

784
00:25:37.671 --> 00:25:39.710
d Christianized as well.

785
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:40.370
Um,

786
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:42.020
and as I said before,

787
00:25:42.021 --> 00:25:42.201
you know,

788
00:25:42.201 --> 00:25:43.040
the Board Monet,

789
00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:45.590
I mean you don't have to know these regions just to know that you know something

790
00:25:45.591 --> 00:25:46.580
about the big ones.

791
00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:50.150
So there are big regional disparities in this.

792
00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:51.141
And the,

793
00:25:51.141 --> 00:25:56.141
this is background to the separation of the church and state a of church and

794
00:25:57.381 --> 00:26:02.381
state in 1905 and to the various law as you can read it and sour wines,

795
00:26:04.161 --> 00:26:04.994
books,

796
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:05.390
uh,

797
00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:08.870
the anticlerical legislation that really starts in 1878,

798
00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:10.430
1879,

799
00:26:10.431 --> 00:26:11.720
they will lead to expulsion of,

800
00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:16.730
of some of the religious orders and eventually that decoupling of church and

801
00:26:17.061 --> 00:26:19.400
state in 1905.

802
00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.270
Now this to be sure is a rather pessimistic from the point of view of the church

803
00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:28.390
assessment and perhaps overly self because there has been recent work that has

804
00:26:28.731 --> 00:26:29.564
described,

805
00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:29.991
uh,

806
00:26:29.991 --> 00:26:31.040
in many parts of,

807
00:26:31.041 --> 00:26:33.980
of France and in part parts of their Catholic Germany.

808
00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:38.980
Also a revival of intense religiosity that has a lot to do with miracles.

809
00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.770
Now in the Catholic Church,

810
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:43.500
uh,

811
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:43.950
you know,

812
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.690
in bad times,

813
00:26:45.691 --> 00:26:48.930
sometimes miracles come along to kind of rescue the church.

814
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:54.150
And the case of Bernadette have lured before this course in 1856 was one of it.

815
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:54.781
I mean,

816
00:26:54.781 --> 00:26:59.781
Lord becomes one of the first tourist sites in France after Paris because these

817
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:00.601
all,

818
00:27:00.601 --> 00:27:02.430
it's always young girls by the way,

819
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:07.500
always who see the Virgin Mary never young boys is always young girls.

820
00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:09.240
That's interesting case.

821
00:27:09.241 --> 00:27:14.070
A Mar Penguin and the SAR and what 1876 up here in Germany,

822
00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:19.340
two comes along at a good time for the Catholic Church or Fatima in Portugal in

823
00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:20.340
1917.

824
00:27:20.341 --> 00:27:24.150
It's always young illiterate shepard girls who see the Virgin Mary.

825
00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:26.040
And then what happens is they interview them,

826
00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:29.970
they bring translators to interview them as in the case of Bernadette,

827
00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:30.863
what did you see?

828
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.960
And they stick to their stories and pretty soon,

829
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.740
you know,

830
00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:37.110
their bishops are little skeptical and then they seize upon the moment.

831
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.980
And this becomes the,

832
00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:38.431
you know,

833
00:27:38.431 --> 00:27:43.230
God is telling us something that we have sin in the Virgin Mary is looking after

834
00:27:43.231 --> 00:27:43.650
us.

835
00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:44.101
So it,

836
00:27:44.101 --> 00:27:45.090
it revives,

837
00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:48.900
it happened also in the 1830 is near Granola or is that the forties a place

838
00:27:48.901 --> 00:27:49.830
called Las [inaudible]?

839
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:50.730
Uh,

840
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:54.270
it is sort of a sort of classic.

841
00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.193
And then,

842
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.561
uh,

843
00:27:55.561 --> 00:27:57.900
as I said the other day talking about the railroads,

844
00:27:57.901 --> 00:27:58.531
I mean the first,

845
00:27:58.531 --> 00:27:59.400
and for many people,

846
00:27:59.401 --> 00:28:01.080
only railroad trip they ever took.

847
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:02.071
People that,

848
00:28:02.071 --> 00:28:02.281
you know,

849
00:28:02.281 --> 00:28:05.010
in the 1870s in 1882 didn't have a lot of money,

850
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:06.270
is to wear,

851
00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:07.163
to learn,

852
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.010
to get,

853
00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:08.580
uh,

854
00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:08.851
you know,

855
00:28:08.851 --> 00:28:09.061
to,

856
00:28:09.061 --> 00:28:10.530
to if they're sick,

857
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.870
to try to be healed or to buy holy water.

858
00:28:12.871 --> 00:28:15.750
I just saw something the other day that they had a big confrontation and an

859
00:28:15.751 --> 00:28:18.420
airport because they refuse to let him carry holy water.

860
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.750
On the plane because it was bigger than a mini tube of toothpaste.

861
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:22.021
You know,

862
00:28:22.021 --> 00:28:22.141
they,

863
00:28:22.141 --> 00:28:23.160
how they take away,

864
00:28:23.161 --> 00:28:26.250
you can only have little bottles instead of big bottles and it will even happen

865
00:28:26.251 --> 00:28:26.440
on the,

866
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:26.690
you know,

867
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:28.710
on a paypal airplane or something like that.

868
00:28:28.711 --> 00:28:28.881
I mean,

869
00:28:28.881 --> 00:28:29.400
so this,

870
00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.630
we live in a very different world now.

871
00:28:30.631 --> 00:28:33.900
They didn't have to worry about that stuff at the time of these miracles.

872
00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:37.290
But pilgrimages to Lou [inaudible] from every diocese in France.

873
00:28:37.291 --> 00:28:39.630
It's still something that you see,

874
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.021
uh,

875
00:28:40.021 --> 00:28:41.160
all the time.

876
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:42.420
But regional,

877
00:28:42.421 --> 00:28:44.880
these regional outlines remain very,

878
00:28:44.881 --> 00:28:45.714
very true.

879
00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:46.140
Uh,

880
00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:46.973
indeed.

881
00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:49.410
So in 1905,

882
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:54.650
what happens is the church and the state get separated that the clergy are going

883
00:28:56.911 --> 00:28:59.160
to be pretty much left on their own now,

884
00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:00.210
uh,

885
00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:00.810
that,

886
00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:01.410
uh,

887
00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:01.951
uh,

888
00:29:01.951 --> 00:29:06.120
the state has control over a religious buildings.

889
00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:06.811
Uh,

890
00:29:06.811 --> 00:29:11.490
and this is bad news for priests and for nuns.

891
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:12.390
Now when I,

892
00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:12.611
I've,

893
00:29:12.611 --> 00:29:15.270
I admitted one thing when I was talking about their religious revival,

894
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.710
and this is something that goes very,

895
00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:18.150
it goes back to the early,

896
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:19.081
well not early days,

897
00:29:19.081 --> 00:29:21.390
but it goes back at least to the 16th century.

898
00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.160
And probably earlier if I knew yes,

899
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:24.000
earlier,

900
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:24.541
earlier than that,

901
00:29:24.541 --> 00:29:25.980
it goes back to the medieval period.

902
00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:26.850
Now.

903
00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:30.900
The Roman Catholics view of women had left them pretty much in a state of

904
00:29:30.901 --> 00:29:31.830
subordination.

905
00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:35.310
And that's always pretty much been the case.

906
00:29:35.311 --> 00:29:36.660
I went to a school that was,

907
00:29:36.661 --> 00:29:37.170
uh,

908
00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:37.501
uh,

909
00:29:37.501 --> 00:29:37.741
you know,

910
00:29:37.741 --> 00:29:38.030
the,

911
00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:42.250
the Jesuit schools I said that only it was mostly sports and it only had,

912
00:29:42.251 --> 00:29:43.180
and that's kind of what I did.

913
00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:43.870
Uh,

914
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:44.350
and,

915
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:44.471
uh,

916
00:29:44.471 --> 00:29:44.710
it,

917
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:45.520
it didn't have women.

918
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:45.761
I mean,

919
00:29:45.761 --> 00:29:46.600
that was a,

920
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:48.130
they were just out there somewhere.

921
00:29:48.131 --> 00:29:48.790
And we used to like,

922
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:49.541
like to go to,

923
00:29:49.541 --> 00:29:49.990
uh,

924
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.410
uh,

925
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:50.591
you know,

926
00:29:50.591 --> 00:29:52.660
be all I figured managing me isn't a failed altar.

927
00:29:52.661 --> 00:29:52.931
Boy,

928
00:29:52.931 --> 00:29:53.681
you're looking at one.

929
00:29:53.681 --> 00:29:55.060
But we used to like to go out to the,

930
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.140
to the girls school,

931
00:29:56.141 --> 00:29:56.441
you know,

932
00:29:56.441 --> 00:29:56.571
and,

933
00:29:56.571 --> 00:29:58.930
and help the priest with the mass and in all that,

934
00:29:58.931 --> 00:29:59.171
just to,

935
00:29:59.171 --> 00:30:02.410
how to have a look at these women who we had basically never seen,

936
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.950
uh,

937
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:03.370
uh,

938
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:04.000
before.

939
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.630
But one of the things that happens,

940
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:07.870
it happened in the Catholic Church very early,

941
00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:08.470
uh,

942
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:10.770
is that every time there's a new kind of spurt of,

943
00:30:10.771 --> 00:30:15.220
of religious adherence and belief is that convents,

944
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.770
female convents,

945
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:21.460
the religious orders are one of the places,

946
00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:23.310
one of the only places that,

947
00:30:23.311 --> 00:30:23.800
that,

948
00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.110
that women smart,

949
00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:26.780
uh,

950
00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:31.780
upwardly mobile women can rise and have careers worthy of their intelligence and

951
00:30:34.001 --> 00:30:35.920
organizational skills if you think about it.

952
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.440
And so it's easy looking back,

953
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:38.711
you know,

954
00:30:38.711 --> 00:30:41.740
from our secular age and kind of dissing all these people,

955
00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:42.470
you know,

956
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:47.470
mumbling up in the mountains someplace or are not speaking at all in some cases,

957
00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:49.510
uh,

958
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:50.231
and just,

959
00:30:50.231 --> 00:30:50.471
you know,

960
00:30:50.471 --> 00:30:52.240
simply praying all the time.

961
00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:56.320
But what is often forgotten is for women who couldn't possibly,

962
00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:56.980
you know,

963
00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:57.490
Eh,

964
00:30:57.490 --> 00:30:57.731
you know,

965
00:30:57.731 --> 00:30:58.090
do,

966
00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:01.240
do more than simply bare children and do the best they could in those

967
00:31:01.241 --> 00:31:02.020
circumstances.

968
00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:06.460
Because the struck the strictures of society didn't give them opportunity.

969
00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:11.410
These convents actually have an important role in their lives that is often

970
00:31:11.411 --> 00:31:12.340
simply forgotten.

971
00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:13.160
And,

972
00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:13.410
and,

973
00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:14.440
and the role of,

974
00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:14.760
of,

975
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:15.880
of women teachers,

976
00:31:15.881 --> 00:31:17.890
even though many of them were barely educated,

977
00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:18.640
uh,

978
00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:18.881
you know,

979
00:31:18.881 --> 00:31:21.580
in very many parts of France that were still practicing,

980
00:31:21.581 --> 00:31:23.230
like are part of France,

981
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:23.770
uh,

982
00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:24.340
was,

983
00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:24.551
uh,

984
00:31:24.551 --> 00:31:25.660
it was extremely important.

985
00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.250
And they had what they called,

986
00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.200
they don't call obviously grandfather rules,

987
00:31:29.201 --> 00:31:31.120
but he had essentially grandmother rules,

988
00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:35.800
a phrase they didn't use that meant that these teachers who are female teachers

989
00:31:35.801 --> 00:31:36.850
who were nuns,

990
00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.110
who were allowed,

991
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:41.560
we're allowed to teach in the public schools until they died.

992
00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:45.010
And they were given that dignity to be able to stay and teach there.

993
00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:46.660
And their teaching was valued,

994
00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:47.440
uh,

995
00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.100
for,

996
00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:48.610
uh,

997
00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:48.881
you know,

998
00:31:48.881 --> 00:31:49.071
what,

999
00:31:49.071 --> 00:31:49.630
what's,

1000
00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:50.021
what,

1001
00:31:50.021 --> 00:31:50.311
you know,

1002
00:31:50.311 --> 00:31:51.340
what they did.

1003
00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:51.970
Uh,

1004
00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:53.260
and so again,

1005
00:31:53.261 --> 00:31:53.891
what one has to,

1006
00:31:53.891 --> 00:31:54.230
you know,

1007
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:55.710
has to keep all of these things in,

1008
00:31:55.711 --> 00:31:55.791
in,

1009
00:31:55.791 --> 00:31:55.971
in,

1010
00:31:55.971 --> 00:31:57.310
in perspective and for,

1011
00:31:57.311 --> 00:31:57.791
for example,

1012
00:31:57.791 --> 00:31:58.331
there's a woman,

1013
00:31:58.331 --> 00:32:00.310
a friend of mine who did a book a very long time ago,

1014
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:01.900
which feminists just mall,

1015
00:32:01.901 --> 00:32:03.040
they couldn't stand it.

1016
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:06.910
But it's a very important book because what she looked as at [inaudible],

1017
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.100
her upper class ladies in the north,

1018
00:32:09.101 --> 00:32:11.170
such as those people you're going to read about in Jimmy now.

1019
00:32:11.171 --> 00:32:12.520
So that's a nice transition,

1020
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.470
a vaguely nice transition.

1021
00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.840
And that one of the things that they were able to do because of their intense

1022
00:32:17.841 --> 00:32:21.700
religiosity was organized their own households in ways that they wanted to with

1023
00:32:21.701 --> 00:32:24.910
crucifixes and statues of the Virgin Mary and all this kind of stuff,

1024
00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:28.330
and that they carved off their own separate sphere,

1025
00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:28.960
uh,

1026
00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.480
and participate in their charitable activities.

1027
00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:35.380
So from the point of view of the Catholic church or for religiosity in general,

1028
00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.370
religious practice,

1029
00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:39.130
all the news is not bad,

1030
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.720
but indeed most of it was.

1031
00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:42.860
Um,

1032
00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.480
and it's,

1033
00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:45.650
you know,

1034
00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:47.570
having wouldn't said what I've said,

1035
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:49.130
it's easy for you to,

1036
00:32:49.131 --> 00:32:49.491
to,

1037
00:32:49.491 --> 00:32:52.670
if I ask you this to say in what regions,

1038
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:56.330
where people mad as hell about the separation of church and state and,

1039
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:59.720
and about the inventories that followed in 1906,

1040
00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.160
you would already know the answer.

1041
00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:01.851
Now.

1042
00:33:01.851 --> 00:33:03.140
What were the inventories,

1043
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:06.890
the inventories where they sent some state inspector round who's going to say,

1044
00:33:06.891 --> 00:33:10.310
we're going to look at all the paintings in this church and to assess their

1045
00:33:10.311 --> 00:33:11.144
value.

1046
00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:11.481
Now,

1047
00:33:11.481 --> 00:33:14.990
even in very modest villages have almost no means a,

1048
00:33:14.991 --> 00:33:17.750
they all had some sort of paintings,

1049
00:33:17.751 --> 00:33:19.370
often just terrible art.

1050
00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:20.090
Uh,

1051
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:20.781
but you know,

1052
00:33:20.781 --> 00:33:21.321
you never know.

1053
00:33:21.321 --> 00:33:24.290
Maybe you're going to stagger into a Rubens or something like that purely by

1054
00:33:24.291 --> 00:33:26.220
accident on the border of,

1055
00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:26.480
of,

1056
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:26.681
of,

1057
00:33:26.681 --> 00:33:27.680
of slanders,

1058
00:33:27.681 --> 00:33:28.514
of Belgium.

1059
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:29.510
You don't know that.

1060
00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:31.750
And so they send around these specter,

1061
00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:32.001
the,

1062
00:33:32.001 --> 00:33:32.361
these,

1063
00:33:32.361 --> 00:33:37.361
these inspectors and in many cases the faithful lock themselves in the church.

1064
00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.040
They barricade the church and then they have to bring soldiers in.

1065
00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:47.870
And this looks kind of bad that soldiers are camping in fields near the church.

1066
00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:53.050
Then they have to conscript locksmiths from the towns to come and force open the

1067
00:33:53.601 --> 00:33:54.434
lock.

1068
00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.270
And in many cases that doesn't work.

1069
00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:58.520
So they have to bring people with huge access.

1070
00:33:59.120 --> 00:33:59.871
So again,

1071
00:33:59.871 --> 00:34:01.100
from the point of view of the church,

1072
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:03.890
this is the martyrdom of Sassy bastion.

1073
00:34:03.891 --> 00:34:04.724
Again,

1074
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:07.190
this is the martyrdom of ordinary people.

1075
00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:11.390
At the hands of accrual secularizing centralized state,

1076
00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:14.000
working against the interests of,

1077
00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:16.250
of ordinary religious people.

1078
00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:16.671
Now,

1079
00:34:16.671 --> 00:34:21.020
to be sure that the Catholic Church had not done itself any great favors with

1080
00:34:21.021 --> 00:34:26.021
the paypal syllables of errors in 19 in 1864 that said that modernity don't

1081
00:34:26.661 --> 00:34:27.321
liberalism,

1082
00:34:27.321 --> 00:34:27.951
democracy,

1083
00:34:27.951 --> 00:34:28.910
helping workers,

1084
00:34:28.911 --> 00:34:32.540
anything was bad and it made the church look pretty ridiculous.

1085
00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:37.840
And also there was a huge controversy then over a papal pronouncement in 1871,

1086
00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:40.220
uh,

1087
00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:44.840
that said that when the pope puts on a certain hat that he is infallible,

1088
00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:46.573
infallible.

1089
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.140
Now we don't pay attention to this.

1090
00:34:48.141 --> 00:34:48.381
Now.

1091
00:34:48.381 --> 00:34:49.250
Nobody pays attention to this.

1092
00:34:49.251 --> 00:34:51.320
Now I guess I did completely forgotten about it.

1093
00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:51.980
Uh,

1094
00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.120
but at that time,

1095
00:34:53.121 --> 00:34:55.220
what the pope puts on a certain hat and says,

1096
00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:59.810
you will be excommunicated and burn in hell forever if you vote for a liberal or

1097
00:34:59.811 --> 00:35:00.644
a socialist.

1098
00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:01.480
Well,

1099
00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:01.730
ah,

1100
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:02.600
so what's that going to do?

1101
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:06.560
So the church didn't do itself any favors in being provocative,

1102
00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:07.551
but by night,

1103
00:35:07.551 --> 00:35:08.690
by 1905,

1104
00:35:08.691 --> 00:35:09.740
1906,

1105
00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.800
the Catholic church in the wake of the Dreyfus affair,

1106
00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:13.521
more about that.

1107
00:35:13.521 --> 00:35:16.460
Another time where the Catholic Church went after Dreyfus,

1108
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:17.960
uh,

1109
00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:18.291
uh,

1110
00:35:18.291 --> 00:35:20.000
who it was better than he'd be guilty,

1111
00:35:20.001 --> 00:35:21.770
even if he wasn't guilty because he was a Jew.

1112
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:22.880
Uh,

1113
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.350
by then you've had this rally,

1114
00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:29.060
Rally Mall or rallying of the Church to the republic as an institution.

1115
00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:33.560
And so things should have been better when they go around and knock on the door

1116
00:35:33.561 --> 00:35:34.970
and try to get into these churches.

1117
00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.313
But they weren't,

1118
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:39.360
and people barricade themselves into these churches.

1119
00:35:39.361 --> 00:35:43.020
And so I got interested in this and for example,

1120
00:35:43.021 --> 00:35:45.540
in our particular village,

1121
00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:50.040
one of the things that people told were passed down generation after generation

1122
00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:55.280
is that the troops had been bivouacked in the field behind the new church,

1123
00:35:55.321 --> 00:35:59.340
which had been started in 1896 to replace the old Romanesque church,

1124
00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:01.860
which is disaffected or if it does affect a,

1125
00:36:01.861 --> 00:36:02.640
whatever you call it,

1126
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:06.570
taken out of commission right across from where we live actually.

1127
00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.430
And that the church had come,

1128
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:13.050
I mean that the troops had come with axes and had broken down the doors of the

1129
00:36:13.051 --> 00:36:17.850
church and that people had gone home with pieces of the door,

1130
00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:23.070
cherishing them as you would a piece of the True Cross and what Christ was

1131
00:36:23.071 --> 00:36:23.904
crucified.

1132
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:27.660
And this was handed down from generation to generation.

1133
00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:31.080
And people talked about it as if they had been there.

1134
00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:32.670
Even folks who had been,

1135
00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.250
hadn't been to church and in ages and ages.

1136
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:39.510
Now I got interested in this it because I was writing a book about this place.

1137
00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:43.620
And so I went to all the archives of course,

1138
00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:45.330
and I went to all the newspapers,

1139
00:36:45.331 --> 00:36:49.980
the Catholic newspaper and two and very anticlerical socialist newspaper.

1140
00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:54.800
And I read the accounts of all the incidents in which that happened in all of

1141
00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:57.480
these other villages in this part of France,

1142
00:36:57.481 --> 00:37:00.900
in which tensions between Protestants and Catholics had always been very high

1143
00:37:00.901 --> 00:37:03.240
because of the wars of religion in the 16th century,

1144
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:04.171
17th century,

1145
00:37:04.171 --> 00:37:05.700
and in the 18th century.

1146
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:10.290
And what I discovered was that the event never happened.

1147
00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:16.160
It never happened that there were no troops ever bivouacked outside of the

1148
00:37:16.321 --> 00:37:18.780
church in this particular village called Bella Zoo.

1149
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:24.510
And that there was never a time that the door was bashed down by soldiers with,

1150
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:25.230
uh,

1151
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:30.230
with axes to look at the modest paintings on the walls of this poor church who's

1152
00:37:33.001 --> 00:37:34.800
parishioners had almost nothing.

1153
00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:36.390
The event never happened.

1154
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:37.860
It did not happen.

1155
00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.140
But the,

1156
00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.160
it nonetheless,

1157
00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:44.250
the imagine and her in there,

1158
00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:44.850
you know,

1159
00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:47.730
in there the constitution of their memory,

1160
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.860
it had a place which is that they were defending their church against these

1161
00:37:52.861 --> 00:37:57.450
forces from the outside rather than like the case of our school that they

1162
00:37:57.451 --> 00:37:58.500
couldn't control.

1163
00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:00.840
So it had a place there,

1164
00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.170
even though it never happened.

1165
00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.150
It could have happened,

1166
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:07.103
but it just didn't,

1167
00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:08.220
it never happened.

1168
00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.080
So what's the point of all that?

1169
00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:14.700
Is that the separation of church and state was extraordinarily wrenching in

1170
00:38:14.701 --> 00:38:19.170
areas that were not Decriss denies though there were incidents in some of the

1171
00:38:19.171 --> 00:38:20.310
other ones as well,

1172
00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:24.960
and that people simply got by as best they could,

1173
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:25.980
they could in,

1174
00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:26.610
uh,

1175
00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:28.140
the church continuing,

1176
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:28.560
uh,

1177
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:32.880
to draw people on Sundays and two religious holidays and that,

1178
00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:33.540
uh,

1179
00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:33.661
uh,

1180
00:38:33.661 --> 00:38:33.901
in the,

1181
00:38:33.901 --> 00:38:34.320
in,

1182
00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.510
which was the case in,

1183
00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:35.791
in,

1184
00:38:35.791 --> 00:38:36.700
in our village,

1185
00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:37.670
um,

1186
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:38.503
in and our,

1187
00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:40.060
our village had a priest,

1188
00:38:40.061 --> 00:38:40.780
uh,

1189
00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.190
the last one who was,

1190
00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:43.090
uh,

1191
00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:45.850
denigrated as a red haired ladies man by son of his,

1192
00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:46.930
some of his enemies.

1193
00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:47.830
Um,

1194
00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:48.371
he left,

1195
00:38:48.371 --> 00:38:50.320
I think we got there 20 years ago,

1196
00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:53.440
so about four years before we were there.

1197
00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.350
And as I said the other day in the context of the schools,

1198
00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:57.010
uh,

1199
00:38:57.010 --> 00:39:02.010
the Catholic church now is just a voluntary association in our particular,

1200
00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:03.220
uh,

1201
00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:04.390
part of France.

1202
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:05.590
Like any other one.

1203
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:06.470
Uh,

1204
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:10.060
there are no more people from our village who go to that church.

1205
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:11.590
Then we'll turn up at,

1206
00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:12.290
you know,

1207
00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:14.920
x to play Bingo for the,

1208
00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:15.281
uh,

1209
00:39:15.281 --> 00:39:15.911
for the school,

1210
00:39:15.911 --> 00:39:16.744
far fewer,

1211
00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:17.530
uh,

1212
00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:17.710
uh,

1213
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:19.120
from that point of view.

1214
00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:22.900
But it doesn't mean that the church doesn't have some place in the collective

1215
00:39:22.901 --> 00:39:23.890
memory of the place.

1216
00:39:23.891 --> 00:39:26.530
Even a lot of it is imaginary or some of his imaginary,

1217
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:27.370
uh,

1218
00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:30.070
once there was a huge windstorm as they're frequently is.

1219
00:39:30.071 --> 00:39:31.780
And W we always have these rivers,

1220
00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:32.810
right.

1221
00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:34.170
When a 22nd of September,

1222
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.811
15 years ago,

1223
00:39:34.811 --> 00:39:36.700
the river rose so dramatically,

1224
00:39:36.701 --> 00:39:38.770
it killed about 200 people,

1225
00:39:38.771 --> 00:39:40.600
not in our part in our particular river,

1226
00:39:40.601 --> 00:39:41.090
but,

1227
00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:41.310
uh,

1228
00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:42.370
across the Rhone.

1229
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.300
Um,

1230
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.530
when a big storm came in,

1231
00:39:44.531 --> 00:39:45.640
the statute is rather ugly.

1232
00:39:45.641 --> 00:39:49.930
Statue of the Virgin Mary crashed to the ground and broke into a hundred pieces

1233
00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:53.740
or a thousand pieces in the cafe that's open all year.

1234
00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:57.220
They put up a bowl and people who are very anticlerical always putting money

1235
00:39:57.221 --> 00:39:58.270
into the bowl to,

1236
00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:03.250
to rebuild this church p rebuild the statute because people care that this

1237
00:40:03.251 --> 00:40:07.370
voluntary association remain and that and that it's still a,

1238
00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:08.260
in the Catholic church,

1239
00:40:08.261 --> 00:40:10.330
you call them four wheel Catholics,

1240
00:40:10.331 --> 00:40:12.370
people still will go there for baptism,

1241
00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:16.390
for burial or not in this order and for marriage.

1242
00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:17.200
Uh,

1243
00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:17.651
and,

1244
00:40:17.651 --> 00:40:18.484
uh,

1245
00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:18.810
uh,

1246
00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:19.040
I,

1247
00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.230
I have assisted at,

1248
00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:20.411
uh,

1249
00:40:20.411 --> 00:40:21.340
with my family,

1250
00:40:21.341 --> 00:40:24.520
a combined baptism marriage ceremonies,

1251
00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:25.510
uh,

1252
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:26.770
and where the,

1253
00:40:26.771 --> 00:40:26.981
you know,

1254
00:40:26.981 --> 00:40:27.140
the,

1255
00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:29.560
a couple of we'll marry years and years after,

1256
00:40:29.561 --> 00:40:29.920
uh,

1257
00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:30.790
after having children,

1258
00:40:30.791 --> 00:40:31.870
which is pretty usual.

1259
00:40:31.871 --> 00:40:33.760
It actually in our part of France among many of our,

1260
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:34.080
uh,

1261
00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:35.880
many of our friends and they're still very much couples,

1262
00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:36.910
had just never gotten married,

1263
00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:37.421
uh,

1264
00:40:37.421 --> 00:40:38.254
in France,

1265
00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:38.861
in Paris,

1266
00:40:38.861 --> 00:40:39.670
in the 19th century.

1267
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.230
A quarter of all couples have lived together,

1268
00:40:41.231 --> 00:40:42.220
weren't actually married,

1269
00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:42.861
but it weren't,

1270
00:40:42.861 --> 00:40:45.480
it wasn't that they were just define organized religion is that didn't have

1271
00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:46.630
money to pay,

1272
00:40:46.631 --> 00:40:47.351
to have a marriage.

1273
00:40:47.351 --> 00:40:47.451
And,

1274
00:40:47.451 --> 00:40:48.011
and you know,

1275
00:40:48.011 --> 00:40:50.870
if you've ever read [inaudible] at when they do get married to well,

1276
00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:52.960
as one of his other great novels when they go to them,

1277
00:40:52.961 --> 00:40:53.441
the Louvre,

1278
00:40:53.441 --> 00:40:54.840
it's one of the great scenes in,

1279
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:55.510
uh,

1280
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:56.710
in French literature,

1281
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:57.010
uh,

1282
00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:58.150
so far as I know.

1283
00:40:58.420 --> 00:40:58.780
Uh,

1284
00:40:58.780 --> 00:40:59.120
so,

1285
00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.000
but the trouble with the Catholic Church,

1286
00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:01.331
uh,

1287
00:41:01.331 --> 00:41:01.531
in,

1288
00:41:01.531 --> 00:41:01.801
in,

1289
00:41:01.801 --> 00:41:02.011
in,

1290
00:41:02.011 --> 00:41:02.641
in Francis,

1291
00:41:02.641 --> 00:41:06.250
of course there's no priests anymore and just end with there that something like

1292
00:41:06.251 --> 00:41:09.190
I read it in the bay or one of the newspapers that,

1293
00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:09.970
um,

1294
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:14.020
well over half of all the priests in France now are,

1295
00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.100
uh,

1296
00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:15.401
oh,

1297
00:41:15.401 --> 00:41:20.401
65% of them are over 60 years old and something like 45% or over 70.

1298
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:24.340
And there are almost no religious vocations at all,

1299
00:41:24.341 --> 00:41:26.350
even from religious areas now.

1300
00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.630
So because churches do provide,

1301
00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.051
you know,

1302
00:41:29.051 --> 00:41:32.590
charity still and help organize lives for very elderly people.

1303
00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.370
This is very sad.

1304
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.791
Uh,

1305
00:41:34.791 --> 00:41:38.390
and even Voltaire who once said that if God didn't exist,

1306
00:41:38.391 --> 00:41:39.680
he should be invented.

1307
00:41:39.681 --> 00:41:42.830
He or she should be invented so that he wouldn't be cheated by his wife or his

1308
00:41:42.831 --> 00:41:43.580
Taylor.

1309
00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:45.410
Even Voltaire would have agreed,

1310
00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:45.710
uh,

1311
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:46.543
that the church,

1312
00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:47.870
a church is still,

1313
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.231
uh,

1314
00:41:48.231 --> 00:41:50.750
in France fill some useful function.

1315
00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:54.470
But these regional contracts are still extraordinarily important.

1316
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.290
In d Christianization helped define,

1317
00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:57.720
uh,

1318
00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:00.440
the evolving politics of labelle phones.

1319
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:03.530
Apologies again for this colossal mess about the room.

1320
00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:04.371
Uh,

1321
00:42:04.371 --> 00:42:06.320
we will take care of this as soon as possible,

1322
00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:07.490
like in the next 10 minutes.

1323
00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:07.990
Uh,

1324
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.421
so,

1325
00:42:08.421 --> 00:42:08.780
uh,

1326
00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:10.820
have a great weekend and have fun in sections.

1327
00:42:10.821 --> 00:42:11.210
See it.
