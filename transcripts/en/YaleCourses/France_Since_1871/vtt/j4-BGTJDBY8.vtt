WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.810
Did they want to talk about,
uh,

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.420
the fall of France and then mostly about collaboration.
And next time I'm going,

3
00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:11.070
I'm going to talk about,
uh,
about resistance.
Uh,
so the first part,
just,

4
00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:15.890
just sort of a,
a briefly,
I mean,
looking back,
you know,
on,
uh,

5
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.430
you know,

6
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.130
I ended last time with or mentioned at the end of the hour last time that,

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.521
you know,

8
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:25.521
maybe 1936 was a time when Hitler could have been stopped in the Rhineland,

9
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.701
uh,
this,

10
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:29.910
all this business in the fall of France and the origins of World War One,

11
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.920
I have to be seen in,
in,
in the context of,
of you know,
of,

12
00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:36.240
of World War One.
I mean,

13
00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:41.241
there was a sense that if after the war there was this view that a wars were

14
00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:46.610
started by evil people in high places and,
um,

15
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.480
who were doing evil deeds,
uh,
uh,
in,

16
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.970
in conjunction with,
with,
uh,
other people and Germany signed on the dotted line,

17
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.330
uh,
forced to do so saying they had been responsible for world war one.

18
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.640
And so there was a strong feeling that,

19
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:06.660
that the Wilson and others had that if you had an apparatus like the League of

20
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:07.560
late nations,

21
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.150
and if you had a so open covenance and that everything will be okay,

22
00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:16.890
nobody would ever want to have another war again.
Well,
of course,

23
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.120
uh,
Hitler was determined from the very beginning to have a,

24
00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:22.590
another war again.

25
00:01:22.591 --> 00:01:26.700
And nobody had any illusions about that mine comp with available and all sorts

26
00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:30.750
of languages,
including English.
Uh,
it's the book that he wrote,
my struggle,

27
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:35.751
which he wrote when he was in very comfy prison after the pooch pooch failed in,

28
00:01:35.911 --> 00:01:40.650
in,
in Munich in the early 1920s.
And so,

29
00:01:40.651 --> 00:01:44.010
uh,
I,
you know,
as possible to argue that,
that,
uh,

30
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.420
that France,
which had a whole series of,
of,

31
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:53.160
of rather inept,
uh,
uh,
leaders particularly in,
in,
in the 20s and early thirties,

32
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:56.940
not Leon Blooma wasn't enough at all,
but there was this feeling that,
that,
uh,

33
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.130
or they have another war,
wasn't,
wasn't thinkable.
Uh,
and,
um,
that,

34
00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:04.620
that sort of lies in,
in,
in the background.

35
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.210
Now Hitler's preparation for war.
Um,
and the,

36
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:12.650
the construction of the building of the newest,
newest kind of weapons,
uh,

37
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.210
pushed them at,
uh,
gave them an advantage.

38
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:20.211
Hitler's generals were fairly sure that he would start the war in 1940 or 1941.

39
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.820
And the wars,
you know,
starts on the 1st of September,
uh,

40
00:02:24.821 --> 00:02:28.740
1939 with the invasion of,
uh,
uh,

41
00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:32.760
of Poland.
Now I'm just,
I mean,
militarily,

42
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:36.210
why did France fall so,
so,
so rapidly?
I mean,

43
00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:38.420
you get a sense of this and Mark Block's book,
uh,

44
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.620
but the troop strength was almost equal,
uh,
at the,
at the beginning,

45
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.340
um,
uh,
of the war.
I mean,
after the phony war,

46
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.240
at the beginning of the invasion in 1940,
uh,
of France,

47
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.190
the Germans had 114 divisions.
Uh,
the French had 94 and the,

48
00:02:56.191 --> 00:02:58.140
and the British had 10,

49
00:02:58.141 --> 00:03:02.770
and then you have 20 to a Belgian divisions as well.
So,
uh,
it's about,

50
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:07.690
about even the number of,
of troop strength,
um,
in tanks,
uh,

51
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:12.370
the,
um,
the allies actually had superiority.
Um,

52
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.660
German tanks were lighter and we're faster.
And in the end that,

53
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:19.810
that and the way they were used,
uh,

54
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:23.320
used not just spread along the line,
but used in,

55
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:27.250
in tank and ponds or divisions,
uh,
gave,

56
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.730
uh,
gave the Germans and advantage and,
and the,

57
00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:35.560
the French tanks had much more armor and therefore were heavier and couldn't be

58
00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:39.410
maneuvered very rapidly,
but they,
they'd attached,
you know,

59
00:03:39.411 --> 00:03:42.850
a number of tanks to each division.
They didn't use tanks as,
as really a,

60
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.200
as the kind of rapid use that,
that Hitler had tried out a,
uh,

61
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.170
on Poland.
Uh,

62
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:54.370
the Germans had a superior clear superiority in terms of,
of,

63
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:58.450
of air power,
particularly in light a bombers and in fighter bombers.

64
00:03:58.451 --> 00:04:01.570
And these were used in Poland.
I mean,
they,
these been used in Spain.

65
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.140
So had they had tried these,
these weapons out,
um,

66
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.120
now how did the British and the French and planning for this war that came
along,

67
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.210
uh,
it,
they,

68
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.390
they believe that the war would be another kind of war of attrition.

69
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:20.860
And thus some wag once said.
And so it's,
it's,
it's,
it's tiresome.

70
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.290
How often has repeated that in 1914,

71
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:26.980
the friends who were prepared to fight the war of 1870 71,

72
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:29.620
and in 1939 and 1940,

73
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:34.500
they were prepared to fight the war of 1914 a.
And there's something to it.
Uh,

74
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.160
uh,
they thought that it would be a,
you know,
a long drawn out battle,
uh,

75
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:42.770
and which,
um,
uh,
that a,

76
00:04:42.771 --> 00:04:46.840
a strong defensive line,
the no line,
uh,

77
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.170
those fortresses that were stretched along,
uh,

78
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.920
in Alsace and Lauren and an up in the,
in,
in,
uh,
you know,

79
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:57.280
in the Moselle and other places that,
that,
that these would,
uh,

80
00:04:57.281 --> 00:05:02.080
we would do the trick.
Um,
and that in the end that,

81
00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:04.600
that the sort of of firepower of,

82
00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:09.490
of cannons on defense would be much more important than the kind of rapid

83
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:14.200
movement,
whereas the Germans,
uh,
having already slaughtered the polls,
uh,

84
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.230
um,
who defended themselves rather hurt.
We're very heroically,
but,

85
00:05:18.231 --> 00:05:20.320
but as you know,
you've seen him.
Sure.
Footage of it.

86
00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:24.970
I'm a cavalry sometimes against tanks.
Uh,
they believed in,
in,
in rapid movement.

87
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.280
Uh,
and the word,
the term was the blitz creed.
You know,
that the rapid attack,
the,

88
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.380
the,
the rapid movement.
Um,

89
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.080
and so one of the problems and all the planning of course,

90
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:39.190
is that the Mancino line,
uh,
stops at the Belgian border.

91
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.500
And so once again,
I mean,
you've got,
you've got hills and,
and uh,

92
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.890
and even small mountains in the are gone part of,
of Belgium and in the east.

93
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.950
And the French are assuming that,
that,
uh,
that,
that the,

94
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.460
that the,
the Argonne forest and the owl then in,

95
00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.700
in northern France and an eastern Belgium in northeastern France and in eastern

96
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:06.500
Belgium,
uh,
were impediments,
physical impediments that,
that,
that would not allow,

97
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.880
uh,
the Germans to,
to move through them.
Uh,
and,

98
00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:15.860
and that's exactly what the,
what the Germans did,
uh,
with their,
uh,

99
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:20.210
with their tank,
uh,
uh,
you know,
with their tank,
uh,
columns.

100
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.070
And so,
um,

101
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.800
when 10 tank divisions pour into the owl,

102
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:31.400
then,
uh,
they'd simply waste the,
the,
the,

103
00:06:31.401 --> 00:06:35.690
these lighter a French tanks,
which hadn't been concentrated in any particular,

104
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.900
uh,
a way.
Uh,
and in four days,

105
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.900
the Germans crossed the Moose River,
uh,

106
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.650
and our way inside,
uh,
um,
France and,
and the,

107
00:06:46.651 --> 00:06:50.180
and the German high command thought it would take nine days and the Germans

108
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:52.640
couldn't,
the French couldn't imagine that it was going to take nine days.

109
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.140
It takes four days.

110
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.820
And Hitler does make this one big mistake that allowed Dunkirk to happen.

111
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.130
You know,
the,
the withdrawal of so many British soldiers and,

112
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.160
and French soldiers is that,
that he,
he,
he stops the charge of the tanks.
Uh,

113
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.470
he refuels and this really allows the,
uh,

114
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.440
the evacuation at Dunkirk,
um,
uh,
to,

115
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.370
um,
to occur.
And so then,
I mean,

116
00:07:19.371 --> 00:07:23.030
all of this sort of footage that you've seen of the,
of,
of,
uh,
you know,
of,
of,

117
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.470
of Belgian and French refugees and walking with everything they could push and

118
00:07:27.471 --> 00:07:29.970
wagons or carry with them or put on there,
you know,

119
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.930
on their oxen or horse drawn carts or,
or in,

120
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:39.020
in automobiles are,
you know,
are fleeing the battle zones.

121
00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:44.021
Just like the polls had tried to do a after the September 1st,

122
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:48.980
1939.
Uh,
and so it's just,
it's been repeated again.
It's happened again.

123
00:07:48.981 --> 00:07:53.450
This hell is happened again.
And the difference was,
uh,
in 1940,
of course,

124
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:57.330
you've got the German fighter planes,
uh,
strafing,
uh,

125
00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.280
these refugees and taking huge tolls of license or of picking them off as,

126
00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:04.520
as they move anywhere they could move.
And once again,

127
00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:08.630
southern France and central Francis is inundated with,
uh,
uh,

128
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.070
with people fleeing,
uh,
uh,
fleeing the battle.
Uh,

129
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.380
lots of Belgians ended up in our little village of,
you know,

130
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.060
which then only had about 250 people in it.
Uh,
um,
you know,
fleeing all of this.

131
00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:24.170
And,
and once again,
another French government,
uh,
uh,
is,
uh,

132
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:28.910
they're on the verge of,
of,
uh,
uh,
of disaster.
And,
um,

133
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.950
the armistice is signed at Hitler's insistence in the,
in the railroad car.

134
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:38.550
It wasn't the same one,
but another railroad car in the forest of comb PN were,

135
00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:41.540
were the Germans had signed on the 11th of November,

136
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.550
1918.
And you've all seen images of Hitler going off,
uh,

137
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.240
for the first time in his life to,
uh,
uh,
to,
uh,

138
00:08:50.241 --> 00:08:53.750
Paris as a tourist and doing this little Jig that was filmed and,

139
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.560
and going to the,
uh,

140
00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:00.420
Eiffel Tower and the architect can off and all of this business.
And,
uh,
and,

141
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.270
and,
and that was that.
And of course,
uh,

142
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:08.160
the French now moving into this central part of the lecture,

143
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.840
um,
a new French government,
um,

144
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:18.500
collaborates with the Germans and that government is known as Vichy France,

145
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:21.780
uh,
because,
uh,

146
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:25.590
Francis divided into two zones of that that is,

147
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:28.380
and you can read about this in ships,
this book,
but that,
that,

148
00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:30.630
that is occupied by German troops,

149
00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:34.940
essentially the north and the north part of France.
And then the,
the,

150
00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:39.090
the so called free zone,
uh,
which,
um,

151
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:43.830
has his capital in the spa town of Vichy,
uh,
in,

152
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.430
in the Rda.
And the word collaboration,

153
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.560
the English word collaboration,

154
00:09:49.561 --> 00:09:54.561
a word that you all know use to mean simply what one of the major meetings is

155
00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:58.950
that,
that you know,
uh,
you collaborate with somebody.
If,
you know,
in a,

156
00:09:58.951 --> 00:10:00.420
in a section you're supposed to,

157
00:10:00.421 --> 00:10:05.100
you and someone else was supposed to put together a report on this or that,

158
00:10:05.101 --> 00:10:08.430
or you do a lab report together.
Or in psychology,

159
00:10:08.431 --> 00:10:10.830
people collaborate with eight other people.

160
00:10:10.831 --> 00:10:14.580
And one of the problems as assessing folks work for promotion to see who's the

161
00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:17.490
lead investigator.
You collaborate with people,

162
00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:20.860
you collaborate with your brothers and sisters.
I'm trying to organize,
you know,

163
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.100
plans for the holidays and all that.

164
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.090
That was the use until 1941 1940,

165
00:10:27.091 --> 00:10:30.690
41 until world war two.
It still is one of the uses.

166
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:35.930
And the term collaboration took on a less neutral meaning and collaboration

167
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:42.150
because of the experience of countries like France in world war two were in

168
00:10:42.151 --> 00:10:47.130
every country.
Pete people actively helped the Nazis,
uh,

169
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.360
achieve their goals.
Uh,

170
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:54.990
so collaboration took on the sort of sinister term as well.

171
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.680
Uh,
and the word in French and a Collabo,
uh,

172
00:10:58.681 --> 00:11:00.330
is something with somebody who collaborated.

173
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:04.740
And by the end of 1943 and by early 1944,

174
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:09.810
if you were a French collaborator and you woke up one morning and you found a

175
00:11:09.811 --> 00:11:13.320
graffiti with the K for coat for the German word,

176
00:11:13.321 --> 00:11:18.210
for collaborator on your door,
uh,
you were toast.
Uh,

177
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.860
uh,
because it meant that the McKee were,
the resistors were,

178
00:11:21.861 --> 00:11:26.861
were capable enough or confident enough to make that kind kind of threat.

179
00:11:27.511 --> 00:11:30.990
So the word collaboration,
uh,
has taken this very,

180
00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:33.660
very different meaning because of what happened.
And again,

181
00:11:33.661 --> 00:11:36.990
it's not only France in Belgium,
Belgium,
still,

182
00:11:36.991 --> 00:11:39.660
it's a very hotly contested issue because a Flemish,

183
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.570
we're more likely to collaborate right wing Flemish with the Germans.
Uh,

184
00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.340
then walloons,
uh,
and in Hungary for example,

185
00:11:47.341 --> 00:11:50.930
where you can go if you've been to Budapest,
my second favorite city,
uh,

186
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:55.430
where you see all those horrible shoe is not horrible shoes,
but I,

187
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.550
they were pulled out of the,

188
00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:01.750
out of the Danube River af after Jews and communists were gunned down by a

189
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.960
Hungarian collaborators.
And we're left.

190
00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:08.920
Now there's still there sort of cemented in this very small shoes to this

191
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:13.090
ghoulish memorial,
but one that has to be there.
Uh,
you know,
uh,
in these,

192
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.690
in these places or in Bulgaria,
uh,

193
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.750
the Germans didn't need to do lots of things because the,
uh,

194
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:24.680
there were people in every population that we're happy to be there,
better hit.

195
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.070
I mean to see them,
they're better Hitler.

196
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.980
Then bloom went the shouts in 1934,

197
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.270
35 and 36 and those shouts a continued,

198
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.990
of course in France.
Now the history,

199
00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:42.820
history's have their history and,
uh,
there is none in modern French history,

200
00:12:42.821 --> 00:12:46.950
more fascinating,
more,
uh,
Pos,
you know,
then,
uh,

201
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.830
the history of,
uh,
of,
of collaboration,
uh,

202
00:12:50.831 --> 00:12:55.030
in France because even in my Jeunesse,
uh,

203
00:12:55.031 --> 00:12:57.960
even when I was at was a kid,
uh,
the,

204
00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:01.450
the sort of story was that it that did in France,

205
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:06.130
everybody resisted or almost everybody and hardly anybody collaborated.

206
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.150
And that was a myth that was perpetuated by,
uh,

207
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.350
people who had collaborated reactively,
very willingly,
very enthusiastically.

208
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:19.330
Uh,
and it was also a,
the myth that was perpetuated by Charles de Gaulle.
Uh,

209
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.220
because for Charles de Gaulle who assumed the kind of mammal of the resistance,

210
00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:28.760
uh,
what he needed to do was to make people forget the communist resistance and,

211
00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:33.810
and to see himself as for a mystical body of the French people that as his voice

212
00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:37.270
crackled over the airwaves for those who could hear it.

213
00:13:37.271 --> 00:13:38.500
And many people who hadn't heard it,

214
00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:43.501
claimed to have heard it on the 18th of June in 1940 that we must keep a

215
00:13:43.931 --> 00:13:46.930
resisting.
Uh,
it was part of,
of,
of,

216
00:13:46.931 --> 00:13:51.880
of the mantle that he would assume a on his shoulders before he stomped off the

217
00:13:51.881 --> 00:13:52.650
column layout.

218
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:57.520
They do the uglies when he couldn't get his way in every issue after the war.

219
00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.750
Uh,
it was,
but,
but part of,
of,
of the,
of the way that France would,

220
00:14:01.751 --> 00:14:03.910
would put the new France with presented itself,

221
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
it had to be that almost everybody resisted and that only an elite,

222
00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:13.630
uh,
collaborate it.
Um,
there was a movie from 1953,

223
00:14:13.631 --> 00:14:17.070
1954,
uh,
uh,
uh,

224
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:21.220
a documentary in which it's about what happened to the Jews who were taken from

225
00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:25.220
arrested in July,
1942,
a in the my,

226
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:26.560
the Jewish quarter of Paris.

227
00:14:26.561 --> 00:14:29.170
And then the Youth San Louis and there were taken away.

228
00:14:29.171 --> 00:14:32.620
And first they're put at a camp at draw,
see a transit camp,

229
00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:37.360
which is north of Paris in Tennessee.
And the place was called festival in a,

230
00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:40.690
or something like investor Balkan in the transit camp in,
uh,

231
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:45.130
in the Netherlands and,
and,
and Macklin or marine.
Uh,

232
00:14:45.131 --> 00:14:49.150
in Belgium.
I have a student who's working on it,
uh,
a topic now,

233
00:14:49.151 --> 00:14:52.490
but in the film and the original film,
it's a documentary.

234
00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:56.270
You could see French guards,
John Dorm,
they're guarding the Jews who were there.

235
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.300
And of course,
when the film was published,
you couldn't have a friend,

236
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:03.620
Sean Dharm guarding the Jews.
They had to be guarded by,
by Nazis,
didn't they?

237
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.310
So what they did is they took the soldier out of the film,

238
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.890
they lifted right out of the film.
So he's not in the film.

239
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.220
He disappears from the film.
Uh,
and um,

240
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:17.150
until the late 1960s,
this myth of,
of,
uh,

241
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.540
that everybody had resisted or almost everybody,

242
00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.560
only elites had collaborated Petain and his inner circle was the dominant kind

243
00:15:24.861 --> 00:15:25.460
of myth.

244
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.240
And now since then we've had what has been called in a very wonderful book by

245
00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:32.990
Audrey was so no book,
this translated in English,
the Vichy Syndrome.

246
00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:38.720
Now Vishi of people,
uh,
you know,
who didn't live through the two fee sheet,

247
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:43.340
but they're trying to find out what happened and to kind of crucial events of

248
00:15:43.341 --> 00:15:47.990
three kind of crucial events caused people this collective memory,

249
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:51.980
a desire to know what really happened during this time.

250
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.630
And they're three events that were,
or series of events that happen.
Um,

251
00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.980
one was,
uh,
uh,

252
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.270
probably I guess you could say,

253
00:16:02.271 --> 00:16:05.390
and this is what the Russo and others have argued that there was a film called

254
00:16:05.391 --> 00:16:09.200
the sorrow and the pity a,
which goes on and on.
It's four and a half hours.

255
00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:13.330
I used to show it in this class.
I think I described this once in here.
Uh,
uh,
the,

256
00:16:13.331 --> 00:16:16.100
the,
the,
it was,
had a reputation for being a two,

257
00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:19.010
six pack film because it was so late,
so long.

258
00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:21.110
And we would show it and Wla h and at the end,

259
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.320
this is when the drinking age was 18.
And I assure you,
uh,
uh,
you know,

260
00:16:24.321 --> 00:16:26.660
there'd be all sorts of beer bottle.
It's just all over the place.

261
00:16:26.661 --> 00:16:30.800
It was so long and it's,
the sound quality isn't very good,
but it's,
it's,

262
00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:33.170
it's a very important because what the,
what the,
the,

263
00:16:33.171 --> 00:16:37.610
the or Foose who was a producer did,
is he went to one single town,

264
00:16:37.611 --> 00:16:42.350
he went to Claremont fail,
you know,
Vannia and,
and he looked at,
at,

265
00:16:42.351 --> 00:16:44.300
and what happened there at collaboration.

266
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:48.050
And some of the great scenes in documentary history are there when,
uh,
of,

267
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:52.340
of the intentional for repression or forgetting when the two teachers,

268
00:16:52.341 --> 00:16:54.170
if you've seen the film,
you know,

269
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.070
they forget about their Jewish colleague.
Uh,

270
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.740
there's amazing things at the end,
you know,

271
00:17:00.741 --> 00:17:02.630
when they shave the heads of what they called,

272
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.450
rather crudely horizontal collaborators,

273
00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.270
women who had slept with German soldiers.
And at the end of the war,

274
00:17:08.271 --> 00:17:11.480
there's these scenes where they shave their heads and haul them to the streets,

275
00:17:11.481 --> 00:17:14.660
not just in criminal federal.
And at the end there is,
there is,

276
00:17:14.661 --> 00:17:15.620
I think I said this the first day,

277
00:17:15.621 --> 00:17:20.450
but there is a Malisa Chavela da who was a sort of Shawnta are there sort of

278
00:17:20.451 --> 00:17:25.370
crooner of your grandparents' generation who became the famous French person in

279
00:17:25.371 --> 00:17:28.700
the u s with his excellent.
And like that.
Then at the very end of the film,

280
00:17:28.701 --> 00:17:31.940
he says,
well,
you know,
uh,
he says,
you know,

281
00:17:31.941 --> 00:17:36.110
there are these stories that I was seeing in Germany,
but I want to tell you,

282
00:17:36.111 --> 00:17:38.720
I was only seeing four z boys.
That is the,

283
00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:41.900
the people who had gone off and been been,
uh,

284
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.900
who had been captured in the fighting or who had gone and,
and,

285
00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:48.950
and had to go into obligatory service.

286
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.510
I'll tell you about work service had gone to Germany.

287
00:17:51.511 --> 00:17:54.700
Many of them died in the [inaudible],
in the air raids.
And at the end,
you know,

288
00:17:54.701 --> 00:17:59.070
we'd wearing his white suit and his straw hat and,
and,
and uh,

289
00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:03.990
for getting his own very public in origins in,
in,
in,
in my mouth.
He says,

290
00:18:03.991 --> 00:18:05.820
for the Americans,
we're going to see the film,

291
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:08.670
but I want to assure you that I only thing for z boys.

292
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:12.750
And of course it was not the case at all.
Uh,
but this,

293
00:18:12.751 --> 00:18:17.200
what this movie does is,
is it?
And it was only shown in one theater.

294
00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:21.690
I in the Ma,
hey,
appropriately enough,
I saw it,
uh,
you know,

295
00:18:21.691 --> 00:18:24.780
a couple of years after it came out,
it was still in the same single theater.

296
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:29.830
It was made for French TV.
It was never shown on French TV until 1980,

297
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.590
1981 or 1982 never on French TV.
Never,

298
00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.630
never,
never.
Why?

299
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:42.140
Because it told the awful truth is that lots of people believe better Hitler

300
00:18:43.801 --> 00:18:44.634
than bloom.

301
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:49.820
And many people got an a plateau handed to them by the outcome of this war,

302
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:56.120
of this,
this short war,
the kind of regime that they wanted.

303
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.410
What did they want?
Well,
I'll talk more about that in a minute.

304
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.720
The second kind of event that happened is,
uh,
this makes me feel old.

305
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:08.040
I is that my friend Bob Paxton,
who is much older than me,
uh,

306
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.030
that he wrote a book,
uh,
called,
uh,

307
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:14.230
Vichy France that was published in English,
uh,

308
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:19.250
in 1972 and often say in probably 73.

309
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:23.940
Um,
and Vichy France was about,
uh,
it took off.

310
00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.930
It took off the Uhh,

311
00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:31.620
it to cut through this sort of intentional forgetting of what had happened to

312
00:19:31.621 --> 00:19:36.060
look at as collaboration to look at collaboration.
Now,

313
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.500
Bob Paxton did not have the right to use French documents.

314
00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:46.380
Why archival documents?
The kind that I use studying earlier periods.
Why?

315
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.090
Because there's a 50 year role.
Uh,

316
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.170
also because even when he was writing on a guy called Giorgio has,

317
00:19:52.171 --> 00:19:57.030
who was sort of a,
a authoritarian,
um,
crypto fascist,
uh,

318
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.580
in who had a lot of influence in the send the,

319
00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:03.240
a mount and allowed to share and a lot of departments near Paris.

320
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:07.860
He was called a troublemaker by an archivist because he tried to get documents

321
00:20:07.861 --> 00:20:12.450
that would have implicated lots of very powerful families and in strike
breaking.

322
00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:16.710
And that's kind of stuff in the,
in the 1930s,
but when this book came out,

323
00:20:16.711 --> 00:20:19.980
it had a major kind of effect and it was followed by book that he did with

324
00:20:19.981 --> 00:20:23.330
Michael Merritts called Vichy and the Jews,
uh,

325
00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.680
a story that I will tell just in part later,

326
00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:30.000
and this had a huge effect because suddenly here was this American American

327
00:20:30.001 --> 00:20:34.950
historian,
a greatest story and saying it wasn't like you learned in school,

328
00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.540
it wasn't like that.

329
00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.800
And I remember my wife and I were in Roussel at once and we were in a hotel in

330
00:20:41.801 --> 00:20:45.690
Brussels,
in Brussels and,
and um,
there was this inevitable,

331
00:20:45.691 --> 00:20:47.010
so French show,

332
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:50.160
they bring in those six or seven different people and there was an,

333
00:20:50.161 --> 00:20:51.010
and there was a pit,

334
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.320
there were skinhead fascist picketers picketing the Paxton's presence in this

335
00:20:55.321 --> 00:20:56.940
show.
And at one point,
you know,

336
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.870
it's one of the typical French things where they're bringing in somebody who had

337
00:20:58.871 --> 00:21:02.500
lived through the war,
somebody who had read something about the war,
uh,
you know,

338
00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:06.250
and all of that.
It was just the tip of the Mesh.
MSMB do,
but,
or this is thing,

339
00:21:06.251 --> 00:21:08.560
they kind of throw it together.
But at one point this guy gets up and he said,

340
00:21:08.561 --> 00:21:10.940
what do you,
could you tell us about the war?
You were,

341
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:15.040
you didn't know you were only 12 years old then during World War II or whatever

342
00:21:15.041 --> 00:21:15.874
Bob was.

343
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
But this book had an enormous impact and the power of this book and of this man,

344
00:21:21.641 --> 00:21:26.020
he was the one to introduce it.
That's all been,
uh,
as the conscience of France.

345
00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.010
Mr Pack's that packs and don't assign a certain sauce of who said [inaudible].

346
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:34.750
That's pretty heavy stuff by [inaudible] who is a historian.
Uh,

347
00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:39.430
and third really are the trials,
the trials.
Uh,

348
00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:41.770
and,
uh,
as,

349
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:47.070
as collaboration came to be something that people wanted to know about what

350
00:21:47.501 --> 00:21:48.880
happened to the Jews,

351
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:52.150
what happened to the people that were arrested because they were communists,

352
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.960
who were they arrested by the Germans and we're happy to do it,

353
00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:58.330
but there and rested by the French.

354
00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:03.990
Then they started tracking down people with rather bad histories.

355
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:09.070
And one of the first was a man named [inaudible] [inaudible],
v I.

356
00:22:09.071 --> 00:22:11.740
E r and to Va,
uh,

357
00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:17.280
was involved in lots of bad things.
The torture of,
of resistors.
Uh,
uh,

358
00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:21.100
the arrest of and deportation,
the certain death of,
of Jews,

359
00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.200
communists and people like that.

360
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.740
And to VA was hidden by right wing Catholic groups.

361
00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:31.660
They're called antique niece in French.
Um,
the role of the church in all of this,

362
00:22:31.661 --> 00:22:34.690
I,
I better get to in a while.
Um,
and he was hitting,

363
00:22:34.691 --> 00:22:37.770
he was bounced from monastery to monastery in the oatmeal,

364
00:22:37.771 --> 00:22:41.460
a team above a niece and up in the outdoors privas I,

365
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:45.220
and he was hidden and they finally tracked the guy down and they put him on

366
00:22:45.221 --> 00:22:49.180
trial and he was condemned.
And at this trial and at others,

367
00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.410
Paxton became what they call a team wa x bear,

368
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:58.390
an expert witness.
Now that's very important in,
in French law.
If you,

369
00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:58.721
you know,

370
00:22:58.721 --> 00:23:02.020
you have a lawsuit against somebody who screwed up your house or your apartment

371
00:23:02.021 --> 00:23:03.100
for bad work,
you know,

372
00:23:03.101 --> 00:23:07.660
they always bring in witnesses who are experts in carpentry to say that they

373
00:23:07.661 --> 00:23:10.330
screwed up or they didn't screw up at what point they screwed up,
et cetera.

374
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:14.110
But here you've got historians and the story and have a much greater public
role,

375
00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:15.213
uh,
in,

376
00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.670
in France and then the u s I mean people care about history much more than they

377
00:23:18.671 --> 00:23:23.671
do in the u s and so Paxton became this expert witness in the trial of two VA

378
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:29.290
and then the trial will Klaus,
clause B Bar Bie,
uh,

379
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:34.780
who had a close bow,
had tortured people in Leone and to close,

380
00:23:34.781 --> 00:23:39.180
Bobby was in,
had a lot of authority when Mark Block,
when he was,
uh,

381
00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:43.750
set up and arrested on a bridge or a a that goes over the song and tortured a

382
00:23:43.751 --> 00:23:48.080
hideously north of the,
on a place called colonial Honda.
Ah,

383
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:52.610
uh,
and cluck,
cluck,
cluck,
Klaus Barbie was put on trial,

384
00:23:52.611 --> 00:23:55.490
was brought back and,
and Paxton was an expert witness there too.

385
00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.250
But IB was confronted literally with,

386
00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:03.080
with now very old ladies that he had tortured himself in,
in,

387
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:06.680
uh,
uh,
you know,
uh,
during the war.
I mean,
torture is not a good thing.

388
00:24:06.681 --> 00:24:09.200
The Americans do it too now.
And that's not a good thing,

389
00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:12.740
but that's another subject.
Americans didn't use to do things like that,

390
00:24:12.741 --> 00:24:17.380
but they do things now like that now.
Uh,
but pacsun would,
would,
would,
would,

391
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.730
would,
you know,
was an expert witness in this.

392
00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:23.480
And then there was Popol Merissa pop pump and you're old enough to maybe even an

393
00:24:23.481 --> 00:24:27.170
oak.
We is Maurice Pop.
Paul,
uh,
was,
uh,

394
00:24:27.171 --> 00:24:30.230
it works in the prefecture in the [inaudible] in Volvo.

395
00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:34.850
And he was a functionary and Reese,
uh,
pop.
Paul,
uh,

396
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.380
signed the death certificates essentially,
of,

397
00:24:37.381 --> 00:24:41.300
of all hundreds and hundreds of Jews who were taken to the Golf Sanjay Hall and

398
00:24:41.301 --> 00:24:41.781
Boldo,

399
00:24:41.781 --> 00:24:46.440
and then were transported toward the death camps in Auschwitz and the others.

400
00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:51.050
Actually,
I,
it was enough,
Sasa German set up and,
and,
uh,
to Blanca and,
and,
uh,

401
00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:55.250
uh,
dot.
Kao and all these,
these infamous death camps.
Um,

402
00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:00.350
and he went on to a very successful career,
uh,
in the fourth and fifth republic.

403
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.660
A very,
uh,
you know,
kind of important bureaucrat.
And,

404
00:25:03.661 --> 00:25:06.950
and they caught up to this very old man.
Do you put really old people on trial?

405
00:25:06.951 --> 00:25:11.330
We'll put,
p town was on trial after the war and they allowed him to,
uh,

406
00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.700
to die on a small island off the coast of the,
of a,

407
00:25:14.701 --> 00:25:18.520
of the von day or the Atlantic island.
Um,
and,
um,

408
00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.490
there was even a big uproar about 15 years ago when there was a rope Voltaggio.

409
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.970
There was a documentary,

410
00:25:22.971 --> 00:25:26.750
they had very use of Nice music and you saw the old man penning his letters,

411
00:25:26.751 --> 00:25:27.590
et Cetera,
et cetera.

412
00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:32.120
And there are various attempts to steal his bones and bury them in Vail.
Done.

413
00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:36.540
I mean,
so,
but all of this,
the Vichy syndrome,
his obsession with Vichy,
uh,

414
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.020
was accentuated by these trials.

415
00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:43.820
And so when Risa pop poem with put on trial in 1998 and 1999 and at one point he

416
00:25:43.821 --> 00:25:47.990
escapes,
he was under house arrest and he escapes and they arrest him in a fine

417
00:25:47.991 --> 00:25:51.200
restaurant in Switzerland,
which is where he'd gone to it,
you know,

418
00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:53.270
with his friends to try to escape the trial.

419
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:55.520
And then the question of what do you do with them?
He was kind,
he said,

420
00:25:55.521 --> 00:26:00.020
but what he said is,
I was a good bureaucrat.
He said my,
uh,
my,

421
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:04.250
uh,
supervisors,
uh,
where my superiors were,

422
00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.600
we thought it was excellent.

423
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:10.970
And he used that famous argument that Paxton in his book Vichy France demolished

424
00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.980
that is the shield argument.
That is if it wasn't,
uh,

425
00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:18.170
and this is the thing that the people defending Petain use to that.

426
00:26:18.171 --> 00:26:21.470
If it wasn't for me,
if it wasn't for we,

427
00:26:21.471 --> 00:26:24.860
he always used the royal we pay town,
uh,
uh,

428
00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.620
then things wouldn't be even worse.
And Pat Paul said,
well,
you know,

429
00:26:27.621 --> 00:26:30.890
if I hadn't signed this,
this,
this,
I was supposed to sign certificates.

430
00:26:30.891 --> 00:26:34.960
We were supposed to find out who were Jews.
And if I hadn't signed,
uh,
you know,

431
00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:39.320
if I,
I only signed,
you know,
400 out of the 600 or whatever,
well,
you know,

432
00:26:39.321 --> 00:26:44.100
an impulse to Coopa.
But I mean,
it just,
the w was a pathetic,
and then he was,

433
00:26:44.101 --> 00:26:48.390
he was found guilty.
I am.
And then they put him in,

434
00:26:48.391 --> 00:26:52.080
in jail under very nice conditions for awhile.
And then he had gotten very sick.

435
00:26:52.081 --> 00:26:54.560
He just died within the last year.
And I think he's,
you know,

436
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:58.230
90 years was 90 or something like that.
Yep.
But these trials were sorted.

437
00:26:58.231 --> 00:27:01.120
The third aspect or the third,
you know,

438
00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:06.480
a key moments or three of the key moments in France coming to grips with,

439
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:11.550
um,
with,
with,
with collaboration that not everybody resisted.

440
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.610
And it wasn't just elites who collaborate.
By the way,

441
00:27:14.611 --> 00:27:18.540
there was another guy who was going to go on trial,
uh,
a guy called [inaudible],

442
00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:22.930
who was the head of,
um,
uh,
uh,
he,
he,
he was,
uh,

443
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:27.720
it had,
uh,
one of the heads of the police in Paris,
uh,
uh,

444
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:31.590
during,
uh,
during,
during Vishi.
And he was supposed to go on trial,

445
00:27:31.591 --> 00:27:34.920
but he was murdered by this,
this crazy guy who thought by killing him,

446
00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:37.080
he'd give it publicity to was his own book.

447
00:27:37.081 --> 00:27:39.650
He'd written the sort of bad and book.
And so he went to,
uh,

448
00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.350
busquets apartment and guns them down before he could go on trial.

449
00:27:43.351 --> 00:27:45.510
So unfortunately Bruce Gay and everyone on trial.

450
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:50.870
But so from having no official memory of Vichy,

451
00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:56.520
no,
the only,
you know,
sites of memory they had to do with the resistance,

452
00:27:56.521 --> 00:28:01.230
which was,
I'm going to talk about next time,
uh,
that sense,
you know,

453
00:28:01.231 --> 00:28:05.640
before you were born,
but France underwent this,

454
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
this reevaluation and that was important for people who had lost family members

455
00:28:13.741 --> 00:28:18.450
because of Vichy.
Uh,
it was important for,
uh,

456
00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.660
for Jews,

457
00:28:19.661 --> 00:28:24.660
some 75,000 Jews never came back to France.
They tried,
of course,

458
00:28:24.661 --> 00:28:28.400
at the beginning to end this,
if they did this in Bulgaria to end in Hungary,

459
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:32.220
they had first you'll rest the foreign Jews,

460
00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:33.780
not assimilated Jews.

461
00:28:33.781 --> 00:28:37.860
So the big roundup in July of 1842 and 1942,

462
00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.420
the hospitalist,
the French word half,

463
00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:45.150
I mean the sort of sweep in the mouth,
hey and in,
in,

464
00:28:45.151 --> 00:28:46.200
in a,
and you'll,

465
00:28:46.201 --> 00:28:50.280
San Louie was not done by the Germans who have been very happy to do it.

466
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:53.820
You know,
they didn't care,
they'd do it.
It was done by the French.

467
00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.510
It was done by the French police.
And really,

468
00:28:57.511 --> 00:29:00.420
and one of the worst institutions is of course the Middle East,
the militia,

469
00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:02.760
the militia mil.

470
00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:07.650
I CE the militia who are created in January,
1943,

471
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.150
uh,
to get tough on the Jews get tough on the resisters,
get tough on the,

472
00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:13.170
on the Communist.

473
00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:16.710
And these were some of the worst of the collaborators in the pop home trial.

474
00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:19.440
It came out there.
They interviewed various people who had been in,

475
00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:23.520
were very old by then.
You know,
obviously who had been in,
in,
in,
in prisoned,
in,

476
00:29:23.521 --> 00:29:28.350
in um,
uh,
in,
in Boldo around Boldo.
And they,

477
00:29:28.351 --> 00:29:31.560
I actually brought some German soldiers back there too.

478
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:35.970
And one of them testified,
I remember this,
uh,
uh,
he said if we,

479
00:29:35.971 --> 00:29:38.510
if we had a guy on guy,
you know,

480
00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:42.790
a guy who we picked up in a suite and he was a resistor,
our,

481
00:29:42.791 --> 00:29:46.930
he was a communist or something like that.
If we kind of liked the guy,
uh,

482
00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:47.261
you know,

483
00:29:47.261 --> 00:29:50.560
and you get on with them after a couple of days when you're guarding them and

484
00:29:50.561 --> 00:29:53.680
you find things in common that you have the often,
that wasn't the case,

485
00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.830
that if we wanted to save him from hideous torture,

486
00:29:56.831 --> 00:30:00.580
we didn't give them to the French militia because of what they would do.

487
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.490
But of course,
by 1943 more about this later,

488
00:30:03.491 --> 00:30:06.660
but there was a case in Eros where this woman who had denounced a couple of

489
00:30:06.661 --> 00:30:11.150
resistors and she,
uh,
had,
um,
was an open collaborator and she was,
uh,

490
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:14.080
she lived up in the northern part of l Dash A.
Uh,

491
00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:18.190
and she walked across the bridge across the road one day to go shopping and the

492
00:30:18.191 --> 00:30:21.760
other side of the river and the diploma and a pebble came up behind her and put

493
00:30:21.761 --> 00:30:24.520
a bullet right through her head and blew her head off.
Uh,
you know,

494
00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:28.240
collaborators had to really decide what,
you know,
what there were up to.

495
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:29.800
And of course,
a lot of them,
uh,

496
00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:34.600
something like 10,000 were executed almost immediately in the days after the
war.

497
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:36.400
But for people,
uh,

498
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:38.920
maybe I mentioned this the first day when I was trying to tell you about one of

499
00:30:38.921 --> 00:30:43.030
the things we do,
but for people like my friend who,
um,
uh,
he couldn't remember,

500
00:30:43.031 --> 00:30:46.630
but his brother,
uh,
could remember the day that the Germans,

501
00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:50.770
the Germans in this case came into a French suburb place called Lupa,

502
00:30:50.771 --> 00:30:53.680
who's through mound and took his father who was part Jewish,

503
00:30:53.681 --> 00:30:56.050
who was Greek and took him away.

504
00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:59.860
Then the Nazis came to get him and he was denounced by a French policeman for

505
00:30:59.861 --> 00:31:02.770
being Jewish.
And letters of NCH can roll over the place.

506
00:31:02.771 --> 00:31:05.740
And you wrote a letter of denunciation.
You know,
those are big costs.

507
00:31:05.741 --> 00:31:06.580
You're not saying,
you know,

508
00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.820
so-and-so's watering their lawn too much as they're doing in Atlanta,
which is,

509
00:31:09.821 --> 00:31:12.790
you know,
it's a bad thing to water lawn.
But there was this real Paul Taj,

510
00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.890
I saw it the other day about everybody turning in their neighbors because

511
00:31:14.891 --> 00:31:15.724
they're watering your lawn,

512
00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:18.820
but you write something to the French malicious things.
Someone's as a Jew,

513
00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:20.510
you know,
you're selling out,

514
00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:23.890
you're selling their life away or so and so's of communist or so and so's a

515
00:31:23.891 --> 00:31:27.120
resistor.
And,
uh,
the whole,
um,

516
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:31.150
and for this guy who was father was taken away with a wife after the war

517
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:33.910
everyday when she will,
every Saturday when she went to the market,

518
00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:38.410
she saw the same policeman directing traffic there who had denounced her husband

519
00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:43.270
who is responsible in a personal way,
not this sort of indirect way,
uh,

520
00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:47.680
a personal way for,
uh,
for her,
um,

521
00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.350
the death of her husband.
And for people like that,

522
00:31:50.351 --> 00:31:53.350
there was a sort of a satisfaction that you can,
well,
imagine,

523
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:57.820
even if you're not somebody like,
you know,
somebody of a vengeance.
I mean,

524
00:31:57.821 --> 00:32:01.720
I would have gone and spent years tracking these people down.

525
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.380
Um,
but you know,
she wasn't like that.
Uh,

526
00:32:05.381 --> 00:32:10.030
but there'll be a moment of vindication when,
when the textbooks begin to change.

527
00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.000
That's something too.

528
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.260
And then my kids were in seg on than in France and the textbooks are really,

529
00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.370
now they're starting to,
to change,
uh,
you know,

530
00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.300
change about the way the whole period was covered.

531
00:32:19.301 --> 00:32:22.660
But that's something that comes out of this.
So histories have their histories,

532
00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:27.700
uh,
as,
um,
you know,
as well.
And the next history,
by the way,

533
00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:32.760
and not to sort of leap ahead,
that will be,
it was sort of unveiled.
Um,

534
00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:37.840
we'll be of course,
uh,
the Algerian war and all that.

535
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:38.831
Uh,

536
00:32:38.831 --> 00:32:41.870
and same kind of talk shows that they're beginning day that they've had now for

537
00:32:41.871 --> 00:32:44.990
the last 15 years on French TV all the time.

538
00:32:44.991 --> 00:32:47.150
The documentaries they never would have shown before.

539
00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:52.130
We'll start to happen about the Algerian war and also for those generations

540
00:32:52.131 --> 00:32:53.840
passing away,
you know,

541
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:57.500
it's important for them to talk about these things and you're not in the

542
00:32:57.501 --> 00:33:02.300
situation as I described.
In the case of World War One was only one single,
uh,

543
00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:07.250
former soldier who wasn't,
where a one is still alive in Britain.
Uh,

544
00:33:07.251 --> 00:33:10.430
you know,
if you saw the Ken Burns thing about World War II,

545
00:33:10.431 --> 00:33:13.790
I mean they did a lot of interviews with people.
Now they're 84,
85,

546
00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:16.370
86 [inaudible] 82 extraordinarily lucid.

547
00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:21.350
So there's lots more that can be done.
Now,

548
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:25.460
what did the people who collaborated what,
first of all,

549
00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:30.230
just a moment,
the beginning of two things at the beginning.
Um,

550
00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.760
whereas in voting left in France,

551
00:33:34.761 --> 00:33:39.761
you could do a map of and place a map on that and place it on a map of d

552
00:33:40.611 --> 00:33:44.930
Christianization and the French revolution and the elections of 1849 and I've

553
00:33:44.931 --> 00:33:47.090
said this before and it'd be remarkable,

554
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.090
a remarkable similarity in hardly any changes at all.

555
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:54.980
That's not true in terms of collaboration,
uh,
north,
that true in resistance.

556
00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:59.570
Um,
collaboraters didn't come from one certain region as opposed to another,

557
00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:04.520
which is largely the case in Belgium.
Uh,
uh,
there were collaborators everywhere.

558
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:08.760
They don't come from one social class either.
Um,

559
00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:12.530
now in one of the,
the,
the haunting images of,
um,

560
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:16.470
in this film and Star on the piteous,
there's a guy called Christiana that who,

561
00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:21.510
you know,
noble vintage and he's in or he's interviewed in a smoking,

562
00:34:21.511 --> 00:34:24.120
you know,
you know,
the sort of smoking jacket.
Uh,

563
00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:27.410
and he in his chateau and he's very bright.

564
00:34:27.411 --> 00:34:31.400
He's very articulate and he describes why he liked,
you know,

565
00:34:31.401 --> 00:34:34.970
why he was happy to go and fight along the Nazi soldiers in the east and what

566
00:34:34.971 --> 00:34:38.470
was called the Waffen ss.
You know,
these divisions,
I mean,
he 80,

567
00:34:38.471 --> 00:34:42.470
so articulate and you think,
how can a smart guy like that ever do these things?

568
00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:46.610
How can he hate Jews?
How can you want to see them die?
How can he see,

569
00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:50.990
want to see communists,
you know,
gun put up against the wall and gun down,

570
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:56.270
you know,
working class guys from the na or peasants from,
from the Ole Vannia.

571
00:34:56.750 --> 00:35:01.130
And he explains it.
Now you're more apt to have upper class people collaborate.

572
00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:05.930
Just as in the traction of national socialism in Germany is the middle classes

573
00:35:05.931 --> 00:35:10.160
that go that way first.
And this true in France in the 19,
1930s as well.

574
00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:12.740
But you know,
you can't make any,
any,
uh,

575
00:35:12.741 --> 00:35:15.230
there are working class people collaborate as well.

576
00:35:15.231 --> 00:35:18.260
You can't make any of these kinds of generalizations.
What about religion?

577
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:23.210
Now the role of the pope in all of this is,
is,
is nauseated.

578
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:26.510
The pope knew he did nothing.

579
00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:32.960
He did zero Z oh nothing.
And they knew,

580
00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:36.700
he knew when the mayor,
when Roosevelt,

581
00:35:36.701 --> 00:35:39.280
and these people knew also is that,
you know,

582
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.980
they knew earlier and they did think about it.

583
00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:44.160
There's various reason they didn't bomb the death camps.

584
00:35:44.161 --> 00:35:46.560
But if you bomb the death camps and you're killing a lot of people in the death

585
00:35:46.561 --> 00:35:50.760
camps and all of that,
it's,
you know,
it's not so easy.
But the Catholic church,

586
00:35:50.761 --> 00:35:55.490
the church hierarchy generally was extremely collaborationist because,
uh,

587
00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:59.580
but the bishop of Toulouse Lewis was a very heroic guy who in his sermons would

588
00:35:59.581 --> 00:36:02.340
say,
leave these people alone.
And the Bishop of [inaudible],

589
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:07.170
which is about 45 minutes drive away,
uh,
to the northeast,
uh,

590
00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:12.360
uh,
was,
uh,
you know,
Anne Torres collaborator also,
I'll talk more about priests.

591
00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:14.850
Uh,
Eh,
uh,
you know,
priests are,

592
00:36:14.851 --> 00:36:17.760
are our community leaders in many parts of France.

593
00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:22.550
Some of them were happy to see,
uh,
uh,
the Germans come,
uh,

594
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.310
and some of them were not and some,
some of them were collaborators.
Uh,

595
00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:29.460
and some of them didn't.
And some of them got there is after the war,

596
00:36:29.461 --> 00:36:31.500
there was a priest in a village near,

597
00:36:31.501 --> 00:36:36.330
near us and he had had day I who was a notorious fascist,
uh,
into,

598
00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.870
uh,
you know,
this sort of public reception and all that.

599
00:36:39.871 --> 00:36:42.780
And 1944 August up against the wall,

600
00:36:42.781 --> 00:36:45.600
you can still see the bullet holes there where they gunned him down.

601
00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:49.740
People who collaborated village nearly most,
um,

602
00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:52.710
or I spend a lot of time and [inaudible] has a place called a wears it as a bike

603
00:36:52.711 --> 00:36:54.390
guy from uh,
uh,

604
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:59.370
[inaudible] and [inaudible] 1944 August,

605
00:36:59.371 --> 00:37:02.960
they're partying.
Someone says,
where's the John Down this soul,
these people away.

606
00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:06.500
Where is he?
He's got an an in,
in,
in,
in,
um,
in limos.

607
00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:10.640
A friend of mine and former Guy I knew from the archives of Gal at the end when

608
00:37:10.641 --> 00:37:14.970
he was my friend,
he was my companion will,
uh,
is he would call me.
Um,

609
00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.360
they,
and he saw this cause he was a refugee from Lauren and somebody said,

610
00:37:18.361 --> 00:37:22.980
where's the guy?
The guy's in a f guy is in there.

611
00:37:22.981 --> 00:37:25.800
He's in these,
in Lemoshe.
So they stopped partying,

612
00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:31.920
they walked to the Moje,
nobody had cars or gas.
They go to the aunt's house,

613
00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:37.290
he's there fam,
and they put them at the head of this procession,
a cottage,

614
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:41.870
and they're all shouting and singing and they,
before they're going to party,

615
00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:46.440
put them against the wall like that in this end of that.
So these things,

616
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:48.600
you know,
evoke very strong memories for these people.

617
00:37:48.601 --> 00:37:52.260
But the church's role of the church got what it wanted.
And in many ways,

618
00:37:52.261 --> 00:37:56.820
no divorce there.
Two people executed for abortion.
Actually,
uh,
only two,

619
00:37:56.821 --> 00:38:01.440
but still,
that's a lot for,
uh,
for uh,
uh,
practicing abortion,

620
00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:05.940
um,
nor divorce,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
Uh,
but you know,
it's,

621
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:07.410
that's not the only story.

622
00:38:07.411 --> 00:38:11.850
There were people who moved from the Catholic left into the resistance,
uh,

623
00:38:11.851 --> 00:38:15.120
as many of them joined the Communist Party subsequently.
But anyway,
it's not,

624
00:38:15.121 --> 00:38:18.720
it's not that opening shot.
Um,
but what,
what are these people,

625
00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:23.430
what are these people want?
Who are collaborates?
Here's a couple of themes,

626
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.430
bunch of themes.
Um,
first of all,

627
00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:30.780
the argument that [inaudible] made after the war,
um,

628
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:32.850
was that again,

629
00:38:32.851 --> 00:38:37.330
it's the shield argument is that by collaborating with the Germans,

630
00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.880
uh,
you are preserving the French state.

631
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:43.570
But as Paxton said it with amazing eloquence,

632
00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:46.660
he said they may have stayed the same,
the French state,

633
00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:51.190
but they destroyed the French nation.
What does the French nation mean?

634
00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:56.800
Liberty,
you turn a quality fraternity,
not pottery,

635
00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.570
you know,
and work and all that,

636
00:38:58.571 --> 00:39:02.830
God a et Cetera that they put on the coins during Vishi.

637
00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:05.020
Uh,
but they would say we are,

638
00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:09.010
we are maintaining the innocence of the independence of France and in,

639
00:39:09.011 --> 00:39:12.400
and the innocence that was the right slip there,
the innocence of France.

640
00:39:12.401 --> 00:39:17.401
Because the view had to be that we were martyred by the loss of Udl of autonomy.

641
00:39:17.981 --> 00:39:22.360
And we'll get it back by doing what the Germans want by helping them rebuild

642
00:39:22.361 --> 00:39:24.430
economically.
The Germans wanted to take,
you know,

643
00:39:24.431 --> 00:39:28.660
industrial convert it to war use and that kind of thing.
We'll do what they want.

644
00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:32.890
So that's one theme.
But the shield argument has pretty much been,
uh,

645
00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:35.860
been denounced.
Second,
um,

646
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:41.320
xenophobia that the xenophobia of that,
that characterize the French right.

647
00:39:41.321 --> 00:39:45.970
And the 1920s in the 1930s,
the racism and xenophobia became state policy.

648
00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.040
The foreign Jews were shipped off,

649
00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:55.750
but also lots of quote unquote French Jews.
I'm not making that differentiation.

650
00:39:55.751 --> 00:40:00.690
This is one that,
that they made.
Uh,
and um,
you know,

651
00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:03.730
I think there's a hotel called [inaudible],
which is a very fancy hotel.

652
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:07.420
A several by being on that was a place where key people came after the war.

653
00:40:07.421 --> 00:40:10.330
When Jews came back,
if you made it back,
you went there,

654
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:13.570
you went there every damn day to see if somebody from your family who was coming

655
00:40:13.571 --> 00:40:16.480
back.
And most of them didn't come back.
Most of them didn't come back.

656
00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:21.340
But to xenophobia was no Italians,
no Spanish,

657
00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:26.010
especially communists.
Again,
the fear,
the fear of Marxism,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

658
00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:30.220
Uh,
they put the Spanish refugees in camps.
Uh,
the,
the,

659
00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:33.940
the republic had the Popular Front had at the end of the Popular Front and camps

660
00:40:33.941 --> 00:40:36.690
up in the Pyrenees or gentile,
you know,
uh,

661
00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:41.350
between pappy and on the see places like ours,
gls and all of that.
Uh,

662
00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:41.900
they,

663
00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:46.900
that was what was given to them on the plateau on the platter is to make a

664
00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.890
xenophobia part of state policy.
Third,

665
00:40:50.891 --> 00:40:52.210
and this is a subset,

666
00:40:52.211 --> 00:40:57.211
but it should stand by itself as antisemitism that the French Vichy regime.

667
00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:04.650
And let me interject the fact that it's only in the Vember of 1942 that the

668
00:41:05.471 --> 00:41:10.420
Germans occupied the Vichy zone.
Cause because the resistance is,
is mobilizing,

669
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:13.360
um,
that,
that,
uh,

670
00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:18.390
the French put in laws about Jews depriving Jews of rights that the Germans

671
00:41:22.091 --> 00:41:26.500
didn't even ask them to do.
And in terms of of saying,
well,
if you were Jewish,

672
00:41:26.501 --> 00:41:28.460
cause your grandmother or your grandfather was Jewish too,

673
00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.360
I don't remember exactly the loss,
but the,
but the laws in some ways,

674
00:41:31.361 --> 00:41:35.920
or even harsher than the famous infamous Nuremberg laws of,
uh,

675
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:40.190
of the hike they put in,
uh,

676
00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:45.140
even harsher laws.
And they did it because they wanted to,

677
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:47.270
not because the Germans were saying,

678
00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:50.900
you do this better Hitler then bloom.

679
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:54.320
And that's the way that fee she wanted it.

680
00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:57.050
That's the way that Vichy wanted it.
And,

681
00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.660
and as the Jews disappeared,

682
00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:04.550
as they disappeared to Dossie and these other places,
uh,

683
00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:07.790
how many preset,
and again,
I'm not being provocative and I went to,

684
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.850
I went to a Jesuit school for better for worse,

685
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:13.910
there go the Christ killers there,

686
00:42:13.911 --> 00:42:18.911
they go in the little trains bouncing along off to draw c and then off to the

687
00:42:19.431 --> 00:42:22.910
camp.
So antisemitism becomes official policy.

688
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:27.860
Pay Town was a notorious anti-semite.
The high command of the French army was,

689
00:42:27.861 --> 00:42:31.070
was replete with antisemitism had always been that way.

690
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:34.190
Alfred Dreyfus was better than one Jew,

691
00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:38.330
perish or die in Devil's island.
And it was at the army,

692
00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:40.970
be a,
that it's honor,
be compromised.

693
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:43.940
That's the way they viewed it as they're supported by the assumptionist and all

694
00:42:43.941 --> 00:42:48.410
these other people.
Uh,
so that,
that's important,
uh,
point,
uh,

695
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:53.900
as well.
But there are other themes to that.
If you read things that,
that,

696
00:42:53.901 --> 00:42:57.020
that they wrote at the time that the collaborators road who read the

697
00:42:57.021 --> 00:43:01.180
proclamations of pay tab,
uh,
if you read the,
the,

698
00:43:01.181 --> 00:43:05.040
the kind of a spin,
they didn't call it that,
then,
uh,

699
00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:08.630
around the Marshall who was always supposed to be described as walking with a

700
00:43:08.631 --> 00:43:12.290
sprightly step was rather like when they were trying to describe Reagan.
And,
uh,

701
00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.200
you know,
who the Animus,
his reign was totally out of it.
And,
and,

702
00:43:15.201 --> 00:43:18.170
and the end of their always treat soy supposed to be described or not comparing

703
00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:23.060
Reagan to pay town.
Uh,
but,
but you know,
you're talking,
we were very old people.

704
00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:27.200
Uh,
but,
uh,
he's always supposed to be described in a way that it,

705
00:43:27.201 --> 00:43:28.940
he is his personal,

706
00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:34.210
his body is his being represents what the right considered to be wrong with

707
00:43:34.611 --> 00:43:38.210
France.
That he was a dictator.

708
00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:42.100
He's an authoritarian,
finished the France of air,
Aperitif,

709
00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:46.720
finished the France of,
of quarrelling,
uh,
fragments or factions in the,

710
00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:51.230
in the Shawmanee deputy.
And so I'm about,
by the way,
the fascist,

711
00:43:51.231 --> 00:43:53.860
the role of the actual fascists.
Uh,
it's,

712
00:43:53.861 --> 00:43:55.430
it's rather similar to what happened in Spain,

713
00:43:55.431 --> 00:43:56.390
but I don't have time to do this now,

714
00:43:56.391 --> 00:43:59.690
but the philosophy in Spain where the real fascist and they're kind of kept at

715
00:43:59.691 --> 00:44:04.250
an arm's length by,
by,
uh,
uh,
by,
by Franco,
uh,

716
00:44:04.251 --> 00:44:07.910
the real fascists in all of this,
not the authoritarian right ones,

717
00:44:07.911 --> 00:44:10.910
but they share a lot in common.
All the teams I'm talking about,

718
00:44:10.911 --> 00:44:11.750
we're sharing to both of them,

719
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:13.650
but they were kind of kept them at arm's length in,

720
00:44:13.651 --> 00:44:15.770
in Paris and this kind of stuff.
But anyway,

721
00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:20.920
the decadence that I'm Vichy is going to be an answered a decadents,

722
00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.780
a junior la Rochelle said,

723
00:44:23.781 --> 00:44:28.430
I am a fascist because I have measured the progress of decadence in Europe.

724
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:29.630
And I mean,

725
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:34.380
I believe that I've seen the fascism as the only means of liberating and

726
00:44:34.381 --> 00:44:38.560
reducing decadents.
Uh,
and that this is a term that,
that,

727
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:42.510
that comp cams up open over and over again.
Second,
the church,

728
00:44:42.511 --> 00:44:46.650
I've already said that,
but,
but,
uh,
that,
um,
uh,
give France,

729
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:49.510
they're all sorts of conversions of the,
of the prayer.

730
00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:51.330
Our Father in the Catholic church,

731
00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.180
I don't know if there's a process church just to whatever our father who art in

732
00:44:54.181 --> 00:44:58.800
heaven,
all that,
um,
you know,
uh,
uh,
on earth so that we may live,

733
00:44:58.801 --> 00:45:03.720
give us our day,
our daily bread,
give,
give France back her life,
et Cetera,

734
00:45:03.721 --> 00:45:07.020
et cetera.
That the answer to the,
to the decadence of France,

735
00:45:07.021 --> 00:45:08.050
it's going to be refined.

736
00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:12.810
Those old Christian Catholic values associated with Joan of arc.

737
00:45:12.811 --> 00:45:17.310
By the way,
there's a revival of fanaticism about,
about Joan of arc,

738
00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:22.260
uh,
and,
and this,
this is an important part of,
of the whole thing.

739
00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:24.600
Then it will be returned to moral order.

740
00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:29.520
Remember the government of the moral order of the early of the 1920 then the

741
00:45:29.521 --> 00:45:30.810
1870s.

742
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:35.990
It's a return to moral order when things are passed down from moral authorities

743
00:45:37.171 --> 00:45:41.270
represented by the church in conjunction with,
uh,
with pay tax.

744
00:45:41.271 --> 00:45:43.980
So it's sort of like in a monarchy really.
Uh,
but,

745
00:45:43.981 --> 00:45:47.070
but so the role of religion and of church and all of this is going to be

746
00:45:47.071 --> 00:45:51.420
important.
The boy scouts,
for example,
a scouting,
uh,

747
00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:56.280
has always had very close ties and France to,
uh,
uh,
to,
uh,

748
00:45:56.281 --> 00:46:00.930
to the Catholic church.
And it's still a very controversial there.
Uh,

749
00:46:00.931 --> 00:46:02.430
now,
um,

750
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:08.030
third I mean nationalism that if you'd just been blown away in yet another,

751
00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:11.600
uh,
not yet another net world war one.
It was not a rapid defeat.

752
00:46:11.601 --> 00:46:15.620
It was a victory long victory.
But as an 18,
70,
71,
uh,

753
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:20.750
that Frances independence is that of a nation whose image has been transformed

754
00:46:21.121 --> 00:46:24.060
away from Liberty Fraternity,
equality hell with all of that,

755
00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:29.240
from their point of view into this work of world of order and work and Paci

756
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:34.860
religion.
[inaudible]
goes on,
on,
on,
on the,
uh,
on the coins.

757
00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:37.500
And in doing that and saying that,
uh,

758
00:46:37.501 --> 00:46:42.090
this nationalism becomes one that is exclusionary,
uh,
that is,

759
00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.910
that's one of the characteristics of these right wing movements all over Europe.

760
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:48.110
I Hitler says,
uh,
with a mayor of Vienna said,
and you know,

761
00:46:48.111 --> 00:46:52.440
I just decide who's a Jew.
This is,
you know,
in the 1890s,
uh,

762
00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:56.730
Hitler says,
we will determine who's a Jew and then we will kill them.

763
00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:02.190
And then,
uh,
the pay town was very happy to see the Jews go.
Couldn't,

764
00:47:02.191 --> 00:47:06.060
he could have cared less pay Tassie hero avail know.

765
00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:11.080
And so there's no room in the all,
uh,
of not of,

766
00:47:11.081 --> 00:47:15.060
of the republic,
but of the Marshall for Jews.

767
00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:20.520
That's part of the nationalist method of a message and method,
uh,

768
00:47:20.521 --> 00:47:24.990
of,
uh,
of this.
It's there next,
um,
well,

769
00:47:24.991 --> 00:47:29.490
authority,
authority,
authority comes top down.
I'm kind of repeating,
but,

770
00:47:29.491 --> 00:47:32.270
but you get the point.
Authority comes from top down.

771
00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:36.340
It doesn't come from people elected to represent the,
the,
the Ode.
Gahan,
you know,

772
00:47:36.341 --> 00:47:37.880
to lose his region,
uh,

773
00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:41.260
in the [inaudible] sitting in the Polyvore ball in the political club.

774
00:47:41.261 --> 00:47:45.130
It could authority comes from the top down.
This is the 1920s,

775
00:47:45.131 --> 00:47:48.790
thirties and forties.
And that's what they viewed as a very good thing.

776
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:54.390
Next peasant TISM that true France is what they called it.

777
00:47:55.691 --> 00:47:59.530
True France,
the real France,
not the France of Jews,
not the France of,

778
00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:03.730
of growth of graph.
No strikes,
strikes are illegal.
Not that,

779
00:48:03.731 --> 00:48:07.450
not the strikes of,
of,
I mean not the France of working class organizations.

780
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:12.580
No stage Aytay organize workers need not apply,
need not exist,
uh,

781
00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:16.230
a et Cetera,
et cetera.
That,
and all of this,
uh,

782
00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:20.200
virtue is found in,
uh,
uh,
in the,

783
00:48:20.201 --> 00:48:22.610
in the soil and just Joan of arc,

784
00:48:22.611 --> 00:48:25.840
who's a peasant girl from my bed to her house or what they claim as our house
in,

785
00:48:25.841 --> 00:48:30.340
in the,
in the moods and the,
in the east of France.
She becomes a symbol of,

786
00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:33.000
of not only of sort of this nationalism,
you know,

787
00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:35.890
chasing away the Brits and all of this before she's burning her wall,

788
00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:38.770
but are they English that weren't British then?
Uh,
but,

789
00:48:38.771 --> 00:48:42.170
but becomes the virtue in herself of,
of,

790
00:48:42.171 --> 00:48:44.830
of being attached to the soil.
Uh,

791
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:47.560
that cities are places where Jews hangout,

792
00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:52.600
cities or places we'll organize workers hang out and that the true France is

793
00:48:52.601 --> 00:48:57.100
that,
uh,
of peasants and the soil.
And so these groups that like the Shawl,

794
00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:01.260
where did I write it up here somewhere?
The Sean ta,
uh,
uh,
del [inaudible],

795
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:06.160
which are the sort of work shops or work areas of youth where they're supposed

796
00:49:06.161 --> 00:49:10.150
to get up early in the morning,
you know,
instead of of smoking a pack of Gum,

797
00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:13.240
Gallo was before noon is supposed to get up,
which is a terrible thing.

798
00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:16.660
I just wanted to get up and not drink alcohol at 1130,
but as supposed to,

799
00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:16.990
you know,

800
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:20.650
maybe go running a little than claps reasoning along and then jump into some

801
00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:24.220
pond like the Nazis did.
It was,
we're supposed to do that.

802
00:49:24.221 --> 00:49:28.240
And the Pomeranian frozen Pomeranian lakes,
uh,
that this is this,

803
00:49:28.241 --> 00:49:32.000
this is learning about the true France,
which is this,
this,
you're going to,

804
00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:35.360
you're going to the decline of France,
uh,

805
00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.870
is going to be putting people back on the soil,

806
00:49:37.871 --> 00:49:41.610
putting him into work and all that.
And then,
then there's finally,

807
00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:43.600
and I'm going to have to stop,
but I'm,
I'm basically done.

808
00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:47.020
Or there was this corporatism which was mostly just window dressing.

809
00:49:47.021 --> 00:49:50.850
It's a corporatism they'd read,
they'd read,
uh,
uh,

810
00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.450
something about Italian fascism.

811
00:49:52.451 --> 00:49:55.370
And Mussolini tries to organize a industries hierarchy.

812
00:49:55.371 --> 00:49:59.560
Clay making the argument that workers in bosses who are in say metallurgical

813
00:49:59.561 --> 00:50:01.960
production and have the same interest,
which of course is ridiculous,

814
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.900
but if you're organized things corporately speaking,

815
00:50:04.901 --> 00:50:06.640
you won't have strikes cause there are illegal.

816
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:09.880
And then if you get people to buy into the nation the way that many German

817
00:50:09.881 --> 00:50:13.450
workers did,
but not all,
uh,
then you will solve your social problems.

818
00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:17.550
We won't have anybody.
Everybody will get up and,
and be chanting,
uh,
uh,
singing,

819
00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:20.920
saying their prayers in the morning on their knees and schools that the Marianne

820
00:50:20.921 --> 00:50:24.760
has gone from the walls.
The crucifixes are there.
Uh,
and uh,

821
00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:28.070
you will have this,
a happy vision,

822
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:32.930
one that the good fortune as they believe in it,
of Francis,

823
00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:33.540
uh,

824
00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:38.540
the decadent Francis defeat by these all these strong marching to tonic

825
00:50:39.711 --> 00:50:44.390
warriors,
uh,
had,
uh,
given Cha France,
the,
uh,
the,

826
00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:49.100
the,
the possibility of creating this brave new world without communists,

827
00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:53.530
without Jews,
without gays,
uh,
without abortion,
uh,

828
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:56.060
without strikes,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

829
00:50:56.570 --> 00:51:01.460
But it didn't work out that way happily.
And by a,
as I said,

830
00:51:01.461 --> 00:51:03.140
by the end of 1943,

831
00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:06.590
if you woke up and you saw a k that written on your door,

832
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:11.570
you better get your tooth brush and get ready to move because things began to

833
00:51:11.571 --> 00:51:13.640
change and why it began to change.
