1
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.040
Okay.

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.290
Today I want to talk about the Paris commune.

3
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:06.960
This is how I end the previous course,

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.440
but it's the most appropriate place to start this one because the Paris commune

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.760
hung over Europe,

6
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:15.361
uh,

7
00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:16.040
for,

8
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:16.210
uh,

9
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.080
the next 20 or 30 years.

10
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.011
Uh,

11
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:21.090
and in my view,

12
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.571
uh,

13
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:22.081
the 20,

14
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:25.350
the Paris commune in the massacre that,

15
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.591
uh,

16
00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:30.000
that followed the Paris commune massacre of thousands and thousands of people

17
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.300
anticipated the 20th century when you became guilty for who you just being who

18
00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:39.600
you were a party to the moon.

19
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.291
It's a coop,

20
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:40.860
Bob,

21
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.951
uh,

22
00:00:40.951 --> 00:00:42.360
Paris in Paris,

23
00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:43.560
everybody was guilty.

24
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.731
A shout it out.

25
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:48.930
One of the prosecutors as they shot men and women down.

26
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.741
Uh,

27
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:50.431
it would be,

28
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:51.570
and I'll conclude with this,

29
00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:53.460
the the largest massacre,

30
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.151
uh,

31
00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:54.770
that,

32
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.930
uh,

33
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.930
would take place until the massacre of Armenians by a Turks in the latter years

34
00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:02.400
of the 19th century and in,

35
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.091
uh,

36
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:04.620
in World War One as well,

37
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.890
uh,

38
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.120
in 1915.

39
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.900
Um,

40
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.271
and it,

41
00:01:07.271 --> 00:01:07.481
it,

42
00:01:07.481 --> 00:01:09.120
it sadly anticipates,

43
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.990
uh,

44
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.823
the,

45
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.830
the horror shows of the 20th century to the moon that they could probably,

46
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.470
you were guilty because you were left in Paris because you were too poor to get

47
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.853
out.

48
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.450
So what was,

49
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.730
uh,

50
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.830
the Paris commune?

51
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.310
Uh,

52
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.750
some of you already know this,

53
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.460
but let me talk about that and then give you my view on it.

54
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.970
Uh,

55
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.920
the Paris commune has to be placed in the context of two things going on.

56
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.100
One is that during the second empire,

57
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.620
which was that regime of Napoleon,

58
00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:48.621
the third that lasted from 1850 to two till he was really rounded up by the

59
00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:50.100
Prussians in,

60
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.701
uh,

61
00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:52.560
1870,

62
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.101
uh,

63
00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:57.510
there was in the late 1960 [inaudible] late 1860s,

64
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.630
a revival of Republican and Socialist Organization and of Ann Arkis

65
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.090
Disorganization,

66
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.790
uh,

67
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.690
if you will,

68
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.171
uh,

69
00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:08.010
in June,

70
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.560
uh,

71
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.650
in 1868,

72
00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:14.250
the emperor legalizes public meetings,

73
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.780
which had been illegal,

74
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.560
uh,

75
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.540
and in,

76
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.380
in Paris and in very many places,

77
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:22.740
particularly on the edge of Paris and the margins of urban life,

78
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.890
you had meetings in large warehouses and in big cafes where people discuss

79
00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:31.260
politics and imagined reforms that they wanted in the empire,

80
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.670
or many of them wanted a republic or some sort of democratic,

81
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.840
a socialist,

82
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.950
a republic.

83
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.210
So there's a political mobilization in the late 1860s,

84
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.730
and in the beginning of 1870,

85
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:45.021
uh,

86
00:02:45.021 --> 00:02:46.710
there is a wave of strikes.

87
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.950
Strikes had been illegal in France until 1864 unions would be illegal in France

88
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.160
until 1881.

89
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.460
Uh,

90
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.620
but so you had a wave of strikes.

91
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.740
So that's really the first context and the mobilization of many ordinary people,

92
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.710
uh,

93
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.230
living in Paris.

94
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.060
The second context is the Franco Prussian war,

95
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:17.590
which you can read about in chips,

96
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:19.000
our wines book.

97
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:24.001
But basically what happens is that Louis Napoleon and Napoleon the third get

98
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:29.341
suckered into a war without any allies at all because of various,

99
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:30.190
uh,

100
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.281
uh,

101
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:34.540
dumb things that he'd done against the very clever,

102
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.710
extremely aggressive Otto von Bismarck.

103
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.580
Uh,

104
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.413
the Prussian,

105
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.560
a chancellor,

106
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.520
uh,

107
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.880
it involves one of those obscure things that one had to learn in,

108
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.530
in,

109
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.990
uh,

110
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.291
uh,

111
00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:48.071
western Civ,

112
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:49.690
the way it was taught a long time ago.

113
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:50.260
Uh,

114
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.551
it,

115
00:03:50.551 --> 00:03:50.830
it,

116
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.101
uh,

117
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:54.220
well I suppose it's worth remembering any and involve the candidacy,

118
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.641
uh,

119
00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:55.181
of,

120
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:56.920
of a royal family member,

121
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.770
rather obscure one for the throne of France,

122
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.890
which would have left France surrounded by the royal family of Prussia.

123
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.470
Holin Zolar [inaudible] a name that in this course you need,

124
00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:12.850
not a retain and lettuce and some extraordinary complicated crossword puzzle.

125
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.830
But,

126
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.990
uh,

127
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.410
no,

128
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.680
uh,

129
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.513
Napoleon,

130
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.790
uh,

131
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.860
protests vigorously,

132
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.401
uh,

133
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:21.160
and then trying to add insult to injury.

134
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.610
Uh,

135
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.750
his ambassador literally chases the German emperor around his garden,

136
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.620
uh,

137
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.260
and is,

138
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.490
uh,

139
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.680
a fairly abusive in a verbal way.

140
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.610
And Bismark seizes on this to stoke up,

141
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.881
uh,

142
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:37.180
anger against France and then reveals,

143
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.720
uh,

144
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.390
to the European world are those people who cared,

145
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.990
uh,

146
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.650
that,

147
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.010
uh,

148
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.040
Napoleon the third had earlier tried to make a deal,

149
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:45.580
which,

150
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.030
uh,

151
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.480
in exchange for supporting Prussia against Austria,

152
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:52.390
he would receive Belgium and Luxembourg,

153
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.463
which of course,

154
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.190
uh,

155
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.980
the British could never tolerate.

156
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.040
And so what happens is that he goes to war in the summer of 1870,

157
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.550
uh,

158
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.100
without any allies against Prussia and itself,

159
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.710
German,

160
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.971
uh,

161
00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:07.804
allies,

162
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.070
and he thinks he's going to win.

163
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.850
But as my team was in Michigan Stadium last Saturday with me and me present sad,

164
00:05:15.831 --> 00:05:17.440
very sad person you're looking at,

165
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:18.100
uh,

166
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.810
he was blown out.

167
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.801
Uh,

168
00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:21.730
and uh,

169
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.250
on September 4th,

170
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.450
1870,

171
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.610
uh,

172
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.340
there is yet another insurrection in Paris,

173
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.550
a crowd storms down to the town hall.

174
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:31.930
They seize power.

175
00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:33.580
They proclaim a republic,

176
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.190
they named streets different names,

177
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.820
and they want to prolong the resistance against the Prussian army,

178
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.500
which has a Subaru trail.

179
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.610
And cleverly organized military victories is sweeping,

180
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:49.270
uh,

181
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.740
aside French,

182
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.710
a resistance in the Polian.

183
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.270
The third who's very sick,

184
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:56.680
he would die a couple of years later,

185
00:05:56.681 --> 00:05:58.190
probably have stomach cancer,

186
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.820
is,

187
00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.300
uh,

188
00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.580
is,

189
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.620
is captured,

190
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:01.280
uh,

191
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.730
Eh,

192
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.971
uh,

193
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:04.940
in the battle of Saddam s e d a,

194
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:05.241
n,

195
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:07.160
which is a textile town in,

196
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.000
uh,

197
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.270
near the Belgium border in the north of France.

198
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.770
And he goes off to,

199
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:13.570
uh,

200
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.880
uh,

201
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.400
is sent packing off to Britain.

202
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:17.570
Now,

203
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.770
uh,

204
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.730
what happens then is that,

205
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:20.331
uh,

206
00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:22.250
there are those who want to keep fighting.

207
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.700
Uh,

208
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.650
it's quite clear that,

209
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.891
uh,

210
00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:28.280
one of the demands of Prussia,

211
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.980
and as of late January,

212
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.810
a unified Germany,

213
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.260
uh,

214
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.950
Germany,

215
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.950
the German empire was proclaimed in the hall of mirrors and the Chateau

216
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.220
Versailles,

217
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.560
uh,

218
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.430
by coincidence,

219
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:44.810
but one of the demands is that there'll be a huge indemnity,

220
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.000
which the French will have to pay.

221
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.510
And that El Sauce and law hen that eastern those eastern provinces,

222
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.130
largely German speaking,

223
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.300
I remind you,

224
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.140
uh,

225
00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.580
would be amputated.

226
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.320
And after the Paris region,

227
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.040
uh,

228
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.670
and we'd be a next by Germany and af after the Paris region,

229
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.151
uh,

230
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:06.620
Alsace and Lauryn,

231
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:07.190
uh,

232
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.720
were,

233
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.010
uh,

234
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:13.010
the two most industrialized and prosperous parts of France.

235
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.370
And so in Paris,

236
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.000
uh,

237
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.750
people,

238
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:18.470
uh,

239
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:19.303
uh,

240
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.030
uh,

241
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.220
find themselves a surrounded,

242
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.600
uh,

243
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.990
here we go.

244
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.940
The screen is that the right screen?

245
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.280
I never know who the hell knows

246
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.700
how that works.

247
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.700
They find themself,

248
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:32.930
uh,

249
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:33.181
uh,

250
00:07:33.181 --> 00:07:34.014
surrounded,

251
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.671
uh,

252
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:35.504
and,

253
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.260
uh,

254
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.093
Paris is,

255
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.870
it has nothing like it's one third the size of London at the same time or at any

256
00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:42.680
other time,

257
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.450
but it has a huge conference.

258
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:45.080
Uh,

259
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.680
there was a wall around Paris and there are exterior forts,

260
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:53.390
but you've got an enormous number of people besieged by Prussian,

261
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:53.810
uh,

262
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:54.770
and other,

263
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:54.920
uh,

264
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.580
German,

265
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:55.790
uh,

266
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.440
forces holding on.

267
00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.453
At one point,

268
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.860
a French politician whom you'll meet in the textbook,

269
00:08:00.861 --> 00:08:02.210
at least called Gumby ta,

270
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:03.710
who died very young,

271
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:04.160
uh,

272
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.960
flies away in a balloon,

273
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.030
flies down toward tool,

274
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:08.570
uh,

275
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.540
on the lower valley to try to re re rise up.

276
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:12.070
Uh,

277
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.260
uh,

278
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.630
raise up resistance there,

279
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:19.780
but things get quickly very grim indeed.

280
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:20.880
Uh,

281
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.170
uh,

282
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.530
in October of friends general of capitulates,

283
00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:27.520
rather scandalously in the town of mess,

284
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:27.950
uh,

285
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:28.790
in the east,

286
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.650
which would become a German town.

287
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:30.951
In fact,

288
00:08:30.951 --> 00:08:31.790
you've go to the mets,

289
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.310
maybe if some of your vendor myths,

290
00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:33.950
uh,

291
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.970
you'll see this huge sort of [inaudible] railroad station that was clearly built

292
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:38.450
in,

293
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.580
in the second or of,

294
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:39.861
of,

295
00:08:39.861 --> 00:08:40.110
uh,

296
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.420
uh,

297
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.700
of the Kaisers and,

298
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.291
and of,

299
00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:42.690
uh,

300
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:42.890
uh,

301
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.000
of Bismarck.

302
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:44.541
Uh,

303
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:45.374
and so,

304
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:45.621
uh,

305
00:08:45.621 --> 00:08:46.370
Paris,

306
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:46.671
uh,

307
00:08:46.671 --> 00:08:47.350
is,

308
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:47.470
uh,

309
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:51.680
is surrounded in this sort of glory that was supposed to be the empire has

310
00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:54.380
collapsed on the head of,

311
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:55.140
um,

312
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:55.950
of France.

313
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.650
And to be sure there were lots of crowds in Paris,

314
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:01.170
there were the inevitable crowds who shouted for,

315
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:01.800
uh,

316
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:01.981
uh,

317
00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:02.850
for war,

318
00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:06.060
which was sort of odd because Paris was increasingly a left wing city because

319
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:09.360
the vast majority of the population of Paris were ordinary people,

320
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:09.781
uh,

321
00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:10.340
were,

322
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:10.561
uh,

323
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:11.970
workers more about that.

324
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.670
Uh,

325
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:13.050
uh,

326
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:14.030
another time when,

327
00:09:14.031 --> 00:09:15.330
when I talk about Paris,

328
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:15.990
uh,

329
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.830
but the siege,

330
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:17.251
uh,

331
00:09:17.251 --> 00:09:18.000
goes,

332
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.271
uh,

333
00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:20.970
this siege goes on and on.

334
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:22.320
I'm in Paris.

335
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:23.850
Cha changes appearances,

336
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:26.400
military dress or parts of uniform become,

337
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:27.210
uh,

338
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:27.420
uh,

339
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.440
become seen.

340
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:29.240
Uh,

341
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:29.370
uh,

342
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.260
just about everywhere.

343
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.580
Uh,

344
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:31.930
the Po,

345
00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.920
the problem is feeding all of these people.

346
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:35.350
Uh,

347
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:36.630
how are you going to,

348
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.380
uh,

349
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.130
how are you?

350
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:39.030
How are you going to feed him?

351
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:39.810
Uh,

352
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:40.643
you've got,

353
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.460
uh,

354
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:41.651
you know,

355
00:09:41.651 --> 00:09:42.451
we've got all sorts of,

356
00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:42.900
of,

357
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.130
of of animals.

358
00:09:44.131 --> 00:09:46.260
You've got horses which you need for the army,

359
00:09:46.261 --> 00:09:46.711
but also,

360
00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:47.880
which they start slaughtering.

361
00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:48.990
You've got cattle,

362
00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:52.020
but you have enough food to last for maybe a month.

363
00:09:52.021 --> 00:09:55.860
There's always a lot to drink because of the cost of that is the,

364
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:56.250
uh,

365
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.300
of the wine cellars that,

366
00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:58.620
that people had.

367
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.330
But things get worse and worse.

368
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:03.750
The last regular mail delivery was on September 19th,

369
00:10:03.751 --> 00:10:05.550
and thereafter they use balloons.

370
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.390
Uh,

371
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.120
the balloon was invented in the owl dash,

372
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:08.790
uh,

373
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:09.950
by Gulf ea,

374
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.291
uh,

375
00:10:10.291 --> 00:10:10.710
in,

376
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.000
in the late 18th century.

377
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.920
And the balloon becomes a sort of symbol of,

378
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.480
of perhaps liberty.

379
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.050
Uh,

380
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:17.850
the people in Paris are awaiting,

381
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:18.510
uh,

382
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.870
some sort of military help from other provinces,

383
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.440
but it's simply goes on and on.

384
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.220
Um,

385
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.300
and during the siege,

386
00:10:27.301 --> 00:10:31.110
there were 65 balloon flights carrying two and a half million letters,

387
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:31.800
wing,

388
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.660
a grand total of 10,000,

389
00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:34.100
uh,

390
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:34.320
uh,

391
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.190
kilograms.

392
00:10:35.191 --> 00:10:37.060
So roughly about 20,000 pond,

393
00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:37.500
uh,

394
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.250
pounds.

395
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:42.300
One astronomer actually left Paris to go oss and to,

396
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:42.850
uh,

397
00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:43.683
observe,

398
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:44.340
uh,

399
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:44.800
Eh,

400
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.040
an eclipse.

401
00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:46.320
Uh,

402
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.160
they begin using pigeons in order to fly messages out.

403
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.230
And then the Germans who were crisp portrayed,

404
00:10:52.231 --> 00:10:52.660
uh,

405
00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:53.130
uh,

406
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.420
as committing atrocities,

407
00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:55.254
and they didn't care.

408
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.100
They'd committed a few,

409
00:10:56.101 --> 00:10:57.290
they'd shut some people up in the,

410
00:10:57.291 --> 00:10:58.620
in the north east,

411
00:10:58.621 --> 00:10:59.790
but nothing that would,

412
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:00.061
it would,

413
00:11:00.061 --> 00:11:02.160
it like would occur in 1914.

414
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:02.791
Uh,

415
00:11:02.791 --> 00:11:03.241
and of course,

416
00:11:03.241 --> 00:11:04.170
nothing at all.

417
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.390
Like what would occur in very different circumstances.

418
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.380
1939,

419
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.453
1940,

420
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.210
the Germans bring in the,

421
00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:11.940
the these falcons,

422
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:12.840
uh,

423
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.350
and,

424
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.441
uh,

425
00:11:13.441 --> 00:11:15.600
and they go out and they munched the pigeons.

426
00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.500
And so this was another reason for them to dislike the,

427
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:18.750
uh,

428
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:22.590
the Germans as these poor little pigeons who became the sort of sacred day,

429
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:23.671
a bird,

430
00:11:23.671 --> 00:11:23.911
I guess,

431
00:11:23.911 --> 00:11:24.331
a pigeon's,

432
00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:25.020
a bird.

433
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:25.500
Uh,

434
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.011
and you know,

435
00:11:26.011 --> 00:11:26.850
pigeons have been people,

436
00:11:26.851 --> 00:11:27.720
people including me,

437
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:28.680
eat pigeons.

438
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.080
I mean if PJ no is actually a quite good,

439
00:11:31.081 --> 00:11:31.770
but anyway,

440
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:32.310
um,

441
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.490
uh,

442
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:32.730
it,

443
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:35.310
it seemed like an awful thing to do when they're bringing these falcons and the

444
00:11:35.311 --> 00:11:37.830
hawks who were imported to intercept these people.

445
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:43.260
Now the Paris population included national guardsman come from the outside,

446
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:44.040
uh,

447
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:44.281
uh,

448
00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:45.550
to take refuge in side.

449
00:11:45.551 --> 00:11:47.130
So it's rather like a medieval siege.

450
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:47.730
Uh,

451
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:48.580
from that point of view,

452
00:11:48.581 --> 00:11:49.530
you've got people from the,

453
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.000
the outskirts coming in,

454
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:51.510
uh,

455
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.160
for food and safety,

456
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:58.030
but the population is slightly over 2 million people and that's allowed a lot of

457
00:11:58.031 --> 00:11:59.440
miles to feed.

458
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.330
You've got 1500 Americans,

459
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:03.610
several whom leave accounts of the whole thing,

460
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.260
40,000 Belgians,

461
00:12:05.261 --> 00:12:08.770
30,000 Swiss and 5,000 English.

462
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:09.700
Um,

463
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.550
so you're starting out with about 25.

464
00:12:12.551 --> 00:12:13.480
Please don't write these down.

465
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.800
24,000 cattle,

466
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:16.300
150,000 sheep,

467
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.920
6,000 hogs.

468
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:18.670
Uh,

469
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:22.120
and that is not enough to eat.

470
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.570
And people become quite obsessed with what they're going to eat.

471
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.200
And you're looking at somebody who basically does not like dogs at all,

472
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:30.930
but who loves cats?

473
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:36.230
I and canine butchers replaced horse butchers are the horses had mostly been

474
00:12:36.251 --> 00:12:37.900
eaten up or had been camp commandeered,

475
00:12:37.901 --> 00:12:38.734
as I said before,

476
00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:39.070
uh,

477
00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:39.701
by the army.

478
00:12:39.701 --> 00:12:41.140
You can still in France today,

479
00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:41.610
uh,

480
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:42.250
find,

481
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:42.600
uh,

482
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:42.880
uh,

483
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.870
not canine butchers.

484
00:12:43.871 --> 00:12:46.840
You can find a horse butchers and it's always a red,

485
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:47.380
uh,

486
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.590
front with a goal to head of a horse appropriately enough.

487
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.090
But people began to eat,

488
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:52.240
uh,

489
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:52.990
first,

490
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.190
uh,

491
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:54.040
the first,

492
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:54.421
but the eight,

493
00:12:54.421 --> 00:12:55.780
the animals in the zoo.

494
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:56.680
Uh,

495
00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.513
and uh,

496
00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.391
what's his name?

497
00:12:58.391 --> 00:13:01.030
A castor and pollux who have many appreciate children.

498
00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:04.460
Generations had gone to visit the zoo of find themselves eaten,

499
00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:05.290
uh,

500
00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.200
and they can't eat the tigers cause they're afraid to open the cages.

501
00:13:08.201 --> 00:13:09.550
And unfortunately the tiger is simply,

502
00:13:09.551 --> 00:13:09.731
you know,

503
00:13:09.731 --> 00:13:10.210
Croak,

504
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:10.750
uh,

505
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:11.050
uh,

506
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.690
because they're not going to waste food on them from their point of view,

507
00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.700
but they began eating dogs and cats.

508
00:13:15.701 --> 00:13:19.390
And so you had this rather odd situation where instead of dogs,

509
00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:19.990
uh,

510
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.823
guarding,

511
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:21.420
uh,

512
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:21.710
uh,

513
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:23.440
their master's or mistresses,

514
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.530
you had the masters and mistresses guarding the dogs,

515
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:27.130
uh,

516
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:31.030
against people who would take the dogs and unfortunately kill them and eat them.

517
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:31.550
Uh,

518
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.670
and they eat cats as well.

519
00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:34.151
Uh,

520
00:13:34.151 --> 00:13:34.811
and of course,

521
00:13:34.811 --> 00:13:35.920
rats and,

522
00:13:35.921 --> 00:13:36.340
and,

523
00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:36.780
uh,

524
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:37.120
uh,

525
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.150
Paris had and still has millions of rats.

526
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:40.330
Uh,

527
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:41.163
even in the,

528
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:41.351
uh,

529
00:13:41.351 --> 00:13:44.150
if you could come home about two or two 30 in the morning neuro,

530
00:13:44.151 --> 00:13:44.591
our apartment,

531
00:13:44.591 --> 00:13:46.420
you can still see rather large,

532
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:47.140
ah,

533
00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.970
rats dashing across the,

534
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:49.541
uh,

535
00:13:49.541 --> 00:13:50.380
across the street.

536
00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.880
Some of them who looks so bloated,

537
00:13:51.881 --> 00:13:54.460
they looked like some da or wild boar.

538
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:55.030
Uh,

539
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.040
which you can see occasionally in,

540
00:13:57.041 --> 00:13:57.820
in parts of,

541
00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:58.250
uh,

542
00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:58.420
uh,

543
00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.530
of rural France.

544
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:00.160
Uh,

545
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:00.971
there were tales,

546
00:14:00.971 --> 00:14:01.990
inevitable tales of,

547
00:14:01.991 --> 00:14:02.171
of,

548
00:14:02.171 --> 00:14:02.441
of,

549
00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:03.000
of,

550
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.380
uh,

551
00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:03.770
of,

552
00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:04.320
uh,

553
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.040
w with French food is here.

554
00:14:06.041 --> 00:14:06.311
You know,

555
00:14:06.311 --> 00:14:08.260
the presentation counts for,

556
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:08.840
uh,

557
00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.190
uh,

558
00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:10.420
for something very much.

559
00:14:10.421 --> 00:14:10.601
You know,

560
00:14:10.601 --> 00:14:11.470
when food arrives,

561
00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:12.180
you're likely to say,

562
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:12.580
see,

563
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.750
be on plays on T.

564
00:14:13.751 --> 00:14:13.931
I mean,

565
00:14:13.931 --> 00:14:15.760
it has all sorts of meanings to it as well,

566
00:14:15.761 --> 00:14:16.594
presented theirs,

567
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:18.040
but it's how it looks,

568
00:14:18.041 --> 00:14:19.190
but how it served and,

569
00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:20.170
and of course,

570
00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:20.800
how,

571
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.670
how it tastes,

572
00:14:21.671 --> 00:14:22.150
where,

573
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.480
uh,

574
00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.141
you would have,

575
00:14:23.141 --> 00:14:23.380
uh,

576
00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:23.610
uh,

577
00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.260
unfortunately just pains me when I think of my poor little kitty,

578
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.830
uh,

579
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:27.240
you know,

580
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:27.710
uh,

581
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:28.543
a cat,

582
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:29.020
uh,

583
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:29.890
with Mike,

584
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.450
with mice artfully,

585
00:14:31.451 --> 00:14:31.870
uh,

586
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:32.350
uh,

587
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:32.860
uh,

588
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:33.011
uh,

589
00:14:33.011 --> 00:14:35.140
placed around the cat carcass.

590
00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:36.280
One has to call it that.

591
00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.870
What do you have carcass of cat,

592
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:38.620
uh,

593
00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.220
and,

594
00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:39.820
uh,

595
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.550
people simply got by as best they could.

596
00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:43.780
And so they have this,

597
00:14:43.781 --> 00:14:43.941
uh,

598
00:14:43.941 --> 00:14:44.290
um,

599
00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:48.790
in Bismarck had predicted that the seeds would end if previsions went several

600
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:50.140
weeks without their cafe au Lait,

601
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.950
the whole thing would be over.

602
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.580
But they create a central commission of hygiene and sobriety,

603
00:14:55.581 --> 00:14:56.420
which tell people,

604
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:56.900
you know,

605
00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.580
encourage people to eat healthfully,

606
00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.450
you know,

607
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:00.051
and they don't just,

608
00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:00.321
you know,

609
00:15:00.321 --> 00:15:01.610
get wasted all the time.

610
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:02.210
Uh,

611
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:02.800
uh,

612
00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.830
which is what I would have done,

613
00:15:03.831 --> 00:15:04.480
I'll tell you that.

614
00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.510
But no,

615
00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:06.470
I take that back.

616
00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:07.850
I do not film that.

617
00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:08.600
Uh,

618
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.433
um,

619
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:10.111
they,

620
00:15:10.111 --> 00:15:10.580
um,

621
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:10.820
uh,

622
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.380
here's the proposed menu that we're,

623
00:15:12.381 --> 00:15:13.760
don't have to know French to know this,

624
00:15:13.761 --> 00:15:15.040
but here's the menu that they're,

625
00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:16.310
this is early in the siege.

626
00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:16.531
Uh,

627
00:15:16.531 --> 00:15:20.160
the words for French's Shavasana and here's a menu for business people.

628
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.580
These people must have been freaky,

629
00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:22.740
are fairly wealthy to,

630
00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:24.380
to be able to eat like this.

631
00:15:24.381 --> 00:15:26.120
But here's what you don't even have to know French to,

632
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:27.060
to get this.

633
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.710
It starts with a [inaudible] Chavon Chevelle.

634
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:30.320
We,

635
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.153
oh shoot.

636
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.830
Coolattas Chavela mud coated.

637
00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.170
The Chavela boy has a leadership.

638
00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.220
Hoti booth is Chavela Sally Fla.

639
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.090
Uh,

640
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:42.110
it couldn't do much with,

641
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:43.700
with horse ice cream.

642
00:15:43.701 --> 00:15:46.520
So it sort of trailed by the end.

643
00:15:46.521 --> 00:15:48.320
And as somebody once wrote many a suburb,

644
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:49.243
a suburb,

645
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:49.641
many,

646
00:15:49.641 --> 00:15:51.500
a superb champion of La Shawn.

647
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:52.940
That is the race track,

648
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.570
uh,

649
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:58.570
met their end on the table of some well heeled person from the western fancy

650
00:15:58.851 --> 00:16:00.470
districts of Paris.

651
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:02.000
But it ceased being funny.

652
00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:02.691
I,

653
00:16:02.691 --> 00:16:04.490
and it was nothing like the siege of,

654
00:16:04.491 --> 00:16:05.131
of a,

655
00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:09.530
of Leningrad were something like a million people died in World War II of

656
00:16:09.531 --> 00:16:10.191
starvation.

657
00:16:10.191 --> 00:16:14.540
But there were all sorts of little caskets being dragged along to what past then

658
00:16:14.541 --> 00:16:17.210
for mortuaries old people and young people,

659
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.910
the youngest died in droves.

660
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:20.331
Uh,

661
00:16:20.331 --> 00:16:20.871
and of course,

662
00:16:20.871 --> 00:16:21.950
sheer drunkenness,

663
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:22.460
uh,

664
00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.380
becomes an enormous problem.

665
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.040
And so did venereal disease because of the Paris at any one time,

666
00:16:28.041 --> 00:16:28.790
depending on,

667
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:29.030
you know,

668
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.721
who's counting,

669
00:16:29.721 --> 00:16:29.911
but,

670
00:16:29.911 --> 00:16:34.400
but the number of prostitutes was at least 10,000 and probably about 25,000.

671
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.000
Uh,

672
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.250
and Sylvan year old disease becomes rampant.

673
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.941
Uh,

674
00:16:37.941 --> 00:16:38.540
and,

675
00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:38.991
and,

676
00:16:38.991 --> 00:16:39.051
uh,

677
00:16:39.051 --> 00:16:41.630
they're also a very strange cases of,

678
00:16:41.631 --> 00:16:41.801
of,

679
00:16:41.801 --> 00:16:43.640
of mental illness that were predictable.

680
00:16:43.641 --> 00:16:44.474
There are people who,

681
00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:45.020
uh,

682
00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:48.650
are brought into a mental institutions who literally think that there Joan of

683
00:16:48.651 --> 00:16:49.370
arc,

684
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:49.581
uh,

685
00:16:49.581 --> 00:16:49.821
you know,

686
00:16:49.821 --> 00:16:50.171
who was,

687
00:16:50.171 --> 00:16:50.540
uh,

688
00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:51.081
burned,

689
00:16:51.081 --> 00:16:51.560
uh,

690
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.130
uh,

691
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:52.850
uh,

692
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:53.340
you know,

693
00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.320
old kind of a dose.

694
00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.221
I shouldn't say that,

695
00:16:55.221 --> 00:16:55.510
but,

696
00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:56.080
uh,

697
00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:56.510
uh,

698
00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:57.380
in a law,

699
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:58.090
uh,

700
00:16:58.090 --> 00:16:58.330
in,

701
00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:02.060
in the 15th century or there people that believe that their God or that their

702
00:17:02.061 --> 00:17:05.660
Saint Louis and can somehow save a France.

703
00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:09.890
So by a hunger sets in and it becomes extremely,

704
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.983
um,

705
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:11.430
uh,

706
00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:15.080
extremely sad and tragic and attempts to break out,

707
00:17:15.081 --> 00:17:16.070
simply don't work.

708
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:16.820
Um,

709
00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:19.280
but it had his light moments and I can never resist those.

710
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:19.820
Uh,

711
00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.110
they do a contest.

712
00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:21.770
Uh,

713
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.450
and those who would like to enter a contest saying,

714
00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.910
how can we break out of this awful mess?

715
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:26.331
Oh,

716
00:17:26.331 --> 00:17:27.500
whatever can we do?

717
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:31.400
And just three of the suggestions that came in that I would have awarded them

718
00:17:31.401 --> 00:17:32.650
some sort of prize and,

719
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.440
uh,

720
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:33.830
uh,

721
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:34.071
we're,

722
00:17:34.071 --> 00:17:36.080
we're the following or maybe just a two of them.

723
00:17:36.081 --> 00:17:36.351
One,

724
00:17:36.351 --> 00:17:38.360
somebody says that you did all these prostitutes,

725
00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:38.960
uh,

726
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.700
are a valuable resource for Paris.

727
00:17:40.701 --> 00:17:41.180
I mean,

728
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.200
Berlin had its own,

729
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:42.441
you know,

730
00:17:42.441 --> 00:17:43.160
sad,

731
00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:43.670
uh,

732
00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:44.090
uh,

733
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:45.710
legions of prostitutes as well,

734
00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:49.830
and that they must be equipped with what they called Prosec,

735
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.360
a prosec as impression,

736
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:53.910
but Prusick needles that would have a poison.

737
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:54.361
Uh,

738
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:56.910
and then the prostitutes would go out to encounter,

739
00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:57.540
uh,

740
00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.030
in some sort of cash exchange,

741
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:00.640
uh,

742
00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:05.640
Prussian soldiers and at some key moment in the exchange would stab them in the

743
00:18:06.121 --> 00:18:08.490
neck very gently with this pin.

744
00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.490
That would be the end of their eating.

745
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:12.160
Uh,

746
00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:12.271
uh,

747
00:18:12.271 --> 00:18:13.104
sauerkraut.

748
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.651
Uh,

749
00:18:13.651 --> 00:18:15.210
and then Paris would,

750
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:15.720
uh,

751
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.150
would,

752
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:16.650
uh,

753
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:17.250
free,

754
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:17.820
uh,

755
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.653
free itself.

756
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:18.871
Uh,

757
00:18:18.871 --> 00:18:21.060
somebody else suggested that because of,

758
00:18:21.061 --> 00:18:21.510
of,

759
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.901
of,

760
00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:22.230
uh,

761
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.370
uh,

762
00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:26.130
influence of Wagner and because of the traditional kind of Oompah music that the

763
00:18:26.131 --> 00:18:27.690
presion is always associated with,

764
00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:28.380
with the,

765
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:28.530
uh,

766
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:29.690
Germans that you would track,

767
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:30.150
uh,

768
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:33.450
take the orchestras of Paris and teach them how to play Oompah music.

769
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:33.780
Uh,

770
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:34.830
this is what they called it.

771
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.330
I'm not the Prussians of course.

772
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:36.721
Uh,

773
00:18:36.721 --> 00:18:39.810
and that the one day they simply would open up that one of the gates of Paris

774
00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:43.260
heavily defended and would march out playing this music.

775
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:43.980
Uh,

776
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:44.850
and then,

777
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:45.390
uh,

778
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.270
behind them would become this huge Trojan horse,

779
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.480
which with which they would call the musical myths years,

780
00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:52.020
uh,

781
00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:53.430
or the musical machine gun,

782
00:18:53.431 --> 00:18:56.280
which would then open up and start blasting away.

783
00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:56.780
Uh,

784
00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:56.930
uh,

785
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:57.100
the,

786
00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:57.240
the,

787
00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:57.480
you know,

788
00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.280
the poor Prussians were always,

789
00:18:59.281 --> 00:18:59.491
you know,

790
00:18:59.491 --> 00:19:00.840
always assumed to be by the,

791
00:19:00.841 --> 00:19:03.420
by the sneaky thought Asian regions to bees.

792
00:19:03.421 --> 00:19:04.080
Very dumb.

793
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:04.831
But of course,

794
00:19:04.831 --> 00:19:05.490
they weren't.

795
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:06.011
And the other,

796
00:19:06.011 --> 00:19:06.930
or somebody wrote in and said,

797
00:19:06.931 --> 00:19:07.141
well,

798
00:19:07.141 --> 00:19:08.700
let's just take this huge tarp,

799
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.560
put it on the plus icon called,

800
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:11.250
uh,

801
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:15.450
put Bacon and other things and use pigeon power and all the pigeons would come

802
00:19:15.451 --> 00:19:16.470
to the place.

803
00:19:16.471 --> 00:19:17.131
And then you and Gulf,

804
00:19:17.131 --> 00:19:17.611
the pigeons,

805
00:19:17.611 --> 00:19:22.260
and you have this powerful balloon that can carry all of these people in some

806
00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:22.840
sort of,

807
00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.700
some sort of airborne stagecoach or Denise Jones out of Paris.

808
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:27.450
Uh,

809
00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:27.961
but the,

810
00:19:27.961 --> 00:19:28.720
the thing collapse,

811
00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:28.980
I mean,

812
00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:29.230
it,

813
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.400
it,

814
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.340
it becomes a less and less funny and not at all.

815
00:19:32.341 --> 00:19:33.240
And it's the very beginning,

816
00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:36.120
there was a train that went around the wall of Paris,

817
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:39.600
more about the walls of Paris and other time that's fun to talk about in

818
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.170
prisons.

819
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.320
We take picnic lunches and they'd get on the train and then they hear these

820
00:19:43.321 --> 00:19:47.070
large explosions and realize that they could get killed by these large

821
00:19:47.071 --> 00:19:47.904
explosions.

822
00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:51.120
And so as things are going downhill,

823
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:52.200
uh,

824
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:52.591
the,

825
00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:53.250
uh,

826
00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:54.510
many people in Paris said,

827
00:19:54.511 --> 00:19:54.691
look,

828
00:19:54.691 --> 00:19:55.680
we must keep fighting,

829
00:19:55.681 --> 00:19:59.460
but we must imagine a different world where we have a,

830
00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:02.370
we were being betrayed by the provinces that are not helping us.

831
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.660
And we need to have,

832
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:04.440
uh,

833
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:04.651
uh,

834
00:20:04.651 --> 00:20:05.010
we,

835
00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:05.280
we,

836
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.260
we need to have help from the provinces.

837
00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.100
Uh,

838
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.220
and in January somebody puts up a sign,

839
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:12.480
a big red sign,

840
00:20:12.481 --> 00:20:14.670
red being the color of the left.

841
00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:15.750
Red was illegal.

842
00:20:15.751 --> 00:20:16.350
The color red,

843
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:20.460
red was illegal between 1849 and 1851,

844
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:21.120
uh,

845
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.480
because it was believed to excite one group of people against another,

846
00:20:24.481 --> 00:20:27.040
which is an exact quote from the French law I,

847
00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:28.230
and it's a big read,

848
00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:30.300
a poster that says,

849
00:20:30.301 --> 00:20:34.650
make way for the Commun that the people of Paris would have the right to defend

850
00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:39.651
themselves and to create a better world in the future.

851
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.620
Now let me scramble for my,

852
00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:44.483
uh,

853
00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:45.091
okay.

854
00:20:45.091 --> 00:20:46.860
Well this will be scramble front implement here.

855
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:47.180
Uh,

856
00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.880
this is ironically from 19,

857
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.530
I mean from 1869.

858
00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:51.370
Uh,

859
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:55.570
and this is a euro conservative response to the mobilization of French workers.

860
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:56.673
And this says,

861
00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:57.070
you know,

862
00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:00.070
the working class population won't at all listen to bad advice.

863
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.031
And notice here,

864
00:21:01.031 --> 00:21:01.481
this guy,

865
00:21:01.481 --> 00:21:05.240
this is your basic Parisian Urchin who in 18 30th in a delicate,

866
00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.930
famous Eloqua painting called liberty leaving and the people is sort of the

867
00:21:07.931 --> 00:21:08.650
hero.

868
00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:10.120
But here he started the bad guy,

869
00:21:10.121 --> 00:21:10.930
sort of a governess,

870
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:11.231
gone,

871
00:21:11.231 --> 00:21:12.190
totally wrong.

872
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:12.940
Uh,

873
00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.650
and and hear his temptation.

874
00:21:14.651 --> 00:21:15.910
And here's this working class,

875
00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:20.350
a family that will surely resist all of this.

876
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.000
And this is God.

877
00:21:22.001 --> 00:21:22.391
I love this.

878
00:21:22.391 --> 00:21:22.571
You know,

879
00:21:22.571 --> 00:21:22.981
when picked,

880
00:21:22.981 --> 00:21:25.830
when you first see the first picture you can actually see of Paris,

881
00:21:25.831 --> 00:21:28.540
is that what they call a dead guy with Tepe from 18?

882
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:28.900
Uh,

883
00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:29.670
I mean from,

884
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:30.160
from uh,

885
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:30.791
18,

886
00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:31.060
uh,

887
00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:31.180
uh,

888
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.080
37,

889
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.540
uh,

890
00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.000
the full blow a do tank.

891
00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:34.841
And you can actually,

892
00:21:34.841 --> 00:21:36.460
instead of imagining what things look like,

893
00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:37.530
you can see them and hear it.

894
00:21:37.531 --> 00:21:41.650
This is from the steps of [inaudible] way before the godawful separate core was

895
00:21:41.651 --> 00:21:42.190
built.

896
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:46.630
The basilica more about that some other time when I'm in a real frenzy of,

897
00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:46.920
of,

898
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.550
of contempt for,

899
00:21:48.551 --> 00:21:48.940
uh,

900
00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:49.210
uh,

901
00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:51.130
the destruction of the Parisian skyline.

902
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:51.970
But anyway,

903
00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:52.091
uh,

904
00:21:52.091 --> 00:21:53.530
this looking down for,

905
00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:54.180
uh,

906
00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:54.700
uh,

907
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:54.940
you know,

908
00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:55.150
from,

909
00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:59.740
from Oman and here you've got the image of the female image of liberty,

910
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.903
Maryanne,

911
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:06.220
and she comes in as the provisional government that is going to capitulate.

912
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.050
France is going to,

913
00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:08.590
uh,

914
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:08.860
you know,

915
00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:09.693
give up,

916
00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:10.420
uh,

917
00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:10.711
and,

918
00:22:10.711 --> 00:22:11.230
and,

919
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.360
but not that it's going to make a damn bit of difference.

920
00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:14.580
And then I,

921
00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:15.490
I'd off Tia,

922
00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:15.661
who,

923
00:22:15.661 --> 00:22:17.680
somebody wants to call it a miserable gnome,

924
00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:18.430
uh,

925
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:19.090
t h,

926
00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:20.640
I e r s adults,

927
00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:25.180
a Tiana is there and he's cutting off the right arm of France,

928
00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:25.900
uh,

929
00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.370
which is Alsace.

930
00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.710
And Lauren was stressful,

931
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:30.420
cool.

932
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:34.360
To Marvin and the WHO and all these important things.

933
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:35.343
And here,

934
00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:35.770
uh,

935
00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:40.000
this is Marianne being martyred by the French provisional government.

936
00:22:40.001 --> 00:22:41.080
And in the back is the,

937
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:41.561
is the,

938
00:22:41.561 --> 00:22:46.561
is it the dawning of their social republic of the left that is these ordinary

939
00:22:47.471 --> 00:22:50.740
people who have fought so long and so hard.

940
00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:52.163
Um,

941
00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:54.340
so Paris,

942
00:22:54.341 --> 00:22:56.740
capitulates France,

943
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:57.431
not Paris,

944
00:22:57.431 --> 00:23:00.070
but France could prepare the provisional government per se.

945
00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:00.590
Uh,

946
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.671
uh,

947
00:23:00.671 --> 00:23:01.660
capitulates,

948
00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:02.410
uh,

949
00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:03.270
in the end of,

950
00:23:03.271 --> 00:23:03.591
of,

951
00:23:03.591 --> 00:23:04.130
of,

952
00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:04.500
uh,

953
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:04.751
uh,

954
00:23:04.751 --> 00:23:05.584
January,

955
00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.300
uh,

956
00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:06.730
uh,

957
00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:07.240
of,

958
00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:07.340
uh,

959
00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.040
your 1871,

960
00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.151
uh,

961
00:23:10.151 --> 00:23:10.971
and the,

962
00:23:10.971 --> 00:23:12.220
the oppression troops,

963
00:23:12.221 --> 00:23:16.680
cavalry marched down a horse just don't march they trot,

964
00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:20.290
but they trot down the shots of these a and then the concierge from,

965
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:21.480
from that area go and,

966
00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:26.490
and symbolically and for real intent also clean up the stones afterward and

967
00:23:27.161 --> 00:23:29.470
there's a huge indemnity that has to be paid off.

968
00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:30.221
And France,

969
00:23:30.221 --> 00:23:31.870
we'll lose Alsace.

970
00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:35.950
Loran so France has this provisional government,

971
00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:36.311
I mean,

972
00:23:36.311 --> 00:23:37.240
you can read about this stuff,

973
00:23:37.241 --> 00:23:38.080
it's not that interesting,

974
00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:38.530
uh,

975
00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:40.570
in was passionately interesting.

976
00:23:40.571 --> 00:23:42.700
But in February of 1871,

977
00:23:42.701 --> 00:23:44.920
their elections and the provinces,

978
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:50.360
the conservative western provinces like Brittany return is extremely monarchists

979
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:55.361
dominated national assembly that is going to determine the future of France.

980
00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.520
And the landlords come back to Paris because they had somewhere to go during the

981
00:24:01.521 --> 00:24:03.410
siege and they say,

982
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.310
you pay up,

983
00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.050
you pay up money with interest.

984
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:07.490
And the provisional government says,

985
00:24:07.491 --> 00:24:07.791
yes,

986
00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:10.730
you pay up money with interest and people had no money.

987
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:11.660
Uh,

988
00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:12.081
uh,

989
00:24:12.081 --> 00:24:17.081
and there's just incredible anger and tear who in 1848 had advised another

990
00:24:19.131 --> 00:24:23.030
regime that fell to revolution that is of the July monarchy,

991
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:23.930
uh,

992
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:28.430
the plotting Louie Felipe to withdraw the troops from Paris.

993
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:29.300
Uh,

994
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:29.601
Eh,

995
00:24:29.601 --> 00:24:29.841
you know,

996
00:24:29.841 --> 00:24:30.800
in the account of,

997
00:24:30.801 --> 00:24:31.070
of,

998
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.370
uh,

999
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:33.380
if there's any trouble in Paris.

1000
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.910
He already had this in mind.

1001
00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:35.530
Uh,

1002
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:38.330
on March 18th,

1003
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:39.110
1871,

1004
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.570
he sends troops to Moma,

1005
00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.300
the hill of [inaudible],

1006
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.350
the highest point in Paris,

1007
00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:50.530
which had only been a next in 1860 on January 1st Mamata,

1008
00:24:50.541 --> 00:24:55.100
which still had this somewhat rural atmosphere.

1009
00:24:55.101 --> 00:24:56.450
There's still a wine producer.

1010
00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:56.710
It's all,

1011
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.990
you know,

1012
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:58.820
the vineyard is about as big as this room.

1013
00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.590
It's just so they can sell the label,

1014
00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:01.090
you know,

1015
00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:01.290
of,

1016
00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:01.940
uh,

1017
00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:02.773
wine.

1018
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:02.960
Uh,

1019
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:07.550
from there because the national guard of Paris that had defended parasol

1020
00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:08.360
heroically,

1021
00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.800
they still have got these guns.

1022
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.053
And so,

1023
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.810
um,

1024
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:15.950
they have these guns and so they send the guns or they send the troops to get

1025
00:25:15.951 --> 00:25:16.700
the guns.

1026
00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:17.570
Early in the morning.

1027
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.180
The women who are at the market see the troops coming,

1028
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:21.680
they call the men folk.

1029
00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:22.581
The men folk.

1030
00:25:22.581 --> 00:25:25.010
Take two generals of the provisional government,

1031
00:25:25.011 --> 00:25:28.610
they put them up against the wall and they shoot them and Tiara says,

1032
00:25:28.611 --> 00:25:30.440
now we're going to get these bastards.

1033
00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:32.300
And he pulls all the troops out,

1034
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:33.880
headquartered appropriate and FM.

1035
00:25:33.881 --> 00:25:34.714
They'll sigh.

1036
00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.480
And Paris is surrounded again by,

1037
00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:39.800
uh,

1038
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.633
this case,

1039
00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:43.400
somebody else's government that is the provisional government.

1040
00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:46.520
So the commune begins on the 18th of March,

1041
00:25:46.521 --> 00:25:47.660
1871.

1042
00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:53.120
And it lasts until the end of May,

1043
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:53.953
1871,

1044
00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:54.501
Lennon,

1045
00:25:54.501 --> 00:25:56.780
one's called the festival of the oppressed.

1046
00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:59.120
And Lennon was wrong about many things.

1047
00:25:59.121 --> 00:26:00.110
He's right about a few things,

1048
00:26:00.111 --> 00:26:01.010
but wrong about many,

1049
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:02.240
but he got that one right.

1050
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:04.100
And so for the first time,

1051
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:09.230
ordinary Parisian is found themselves masters of their own lives.

1052
00:26:09.231 --> 00:26:12.200
So wealthy people mostly got out again.

1053
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.720
And the commune holds on,

1054
00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:16.010
uh,

1055
00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:16.590
the commune.

1056
00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:19.610
The numbers of the Commun were swollen by political refugees.

1057
00:26:19.611 --> 00:26:21.420
This is a woman called Elizabeth Dimitria,

1058
00:26:21.421 --> 00:26:23.450
F who was a Russian militant,

1059
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:25.640
who was one of the leaders of the commune.

1060
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.230
And as in the French revolution that has 1789 and following,

1061
00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.820
and as in 18,

1062
00:26:31.821 --> 00:26:36.821
48 clubs of women began to form demanding rights and the commune,

1063
00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:39.381
uh,

1064
00:26:39.381 --> 00:26:41.300
despite the fact that there's lots of,

1065
00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.280
you could hear in the distance,

1066
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:46.740
the guns sometimes getting closer and closer and attempts to break out,

1067
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:48.360
fail miserably.

1068
00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:51.710
They pass all sorts of impressive social legislation.

1069
00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.950
They create nursery school nurseries for working women.

1070
00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:56.370
Uh,

1071
00:26:56.370 --> 00:27:00.900
they give contracts to make national guard uniforms to women's unions.

1072
00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:01.530
Uh,

1073
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:02.070
they,

1074
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.430
uh,

1075
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:06.390
plan what will be a lay secularized education system.

1076
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:07.170
Uh,

1077
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:09.150
they banned night baking,

1078
00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:09.750
uh,

1079
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:10.590
because it was,

1080
00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:11.100
uh,

1081
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:14.160
not good for the health of people working in,

1082
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:15.270
uh,

1083
00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:17.790
in bakeries in the middle of the night.

1084
00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:19.110
And here's a women's,

1085
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.420
a women's club making demands.

1086
00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:23.010
Nobody is yet,

1087
00:27:23.011 --> 00:27:25.620
except these women thinking of female suffered.

1088
00:27:25.621 --> 00:27:26.870
So it's kind of a,

1089
00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:30.330
it's kind of an important moment in the history of women.

1090
00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:34.410
And also it explains the viciousness of the,

1091
00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.540
of the attempt of,

1092
00:27:35.541 --> 00:27:36.360
of the,

1093
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:36.901
uh,

1094
00:27:36.901 --> 00:27:41.850
of the massacre really of ordinary working class women when the whole thing

1095
00:27:41.851 --> 00:27:46.851
falls apart because the women were conceived of as being uppity as putting forth

1096
00:27:47.551 --> 00:27:49.740
claims that they shouldn't be making,

1097
00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:50.580
uh,

1098
00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:51.140
by,

1099
00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:51.420
uh,

1100
00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.920
conservatives and a couple of the Columbia.

1101
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.770
Now one is a woman that you will read about later called Louise Louise and

1102
00:27:55.771 --> 00:27:56.604
Michelle,

1103
00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:57.150
uh,

1104
00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:58.410
who spends half of her time in,

1105
00:27:58.411 --> 00:27:58.641
in,

1106
00:27:58.641 --> 00:27:58.951
in,

1107
00:27:58.951 --> 00:27:59.250
uh,

1108
00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:00.690
in exile in London,

1109
00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:01.080
uh,

1110
00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.730
who is an anarchist basically,

1111
00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:03.271
uh,

1112
00:28:03.271 --> 00:28:05.550
was very important along with Elizabeth Dimitria.

1113
00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.410
And so you're surrounded,

1114
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:07.980
uh,

1115
00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:08.820
and the people,

1116
00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:10.230
they don't agree on everything.

1117
00:28:10.231 --> 00:28:11.550
You've got a Jacoba,

1118
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:12.070
you know,

1119
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:14.310
Jacobins who are the sort of centralized,

1120
00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:14.880
uh,

1121
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.000
radical Republicans are socialists from the French revolution.

1122
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.820
You've got anarchist who wanted not to take over the state,

1123
00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:21.960
but to destroy it.

1124
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.590
I'm going to talk about anarchist another time because I'm writing a book about

1125
00:28:25.591 --> 00:28:26.280
one of them.

1126
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:26.820
Uh,

1127
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.091
uh,

1128
00:28:27.091 --> 00:28:27.570
and,

1129
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:27.661
uh,

1130
00:28:27.661 --> 00:28:31.650
you've got to moderate Republicans who simply wanted Paris to have more

1131
00:28:31.651 --> 00:28:32.490
liberties.

1132
00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:35.520
Visa vi this strongly centralized state.

1133
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:36.600
More about that.

1134
00:28:36.601 --> 00:28:39.690
Next time you've got moderate socialists,

1135
00:28:39.691 --> 00:28:42.600
you've got this whole kind of different people.

1136
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:43.350
Uh,

1137
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:47.010
and they're meeting around tables and talking and arguing and debating and

1138
00:28:47.011 --> 00:28:49.290
yelling and hugging long into the night.

1139
00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:50.031
Uh,

1140
00:28:50.031 --> 00:28:51.780
as the guns draw nearer.

1141
00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:54.540
There were communes in other cities too,

1142
00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:55.800
with a variety of,

1143
00:28:55.801 --> 00:28:56.200
of,

1144
00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:56.430
of,

1145
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:56.631
of,

1146
00:28:56.631 --> 00:28:59.100
of demands and Limos and Luke Cruzo,

1147
00:28:59.310 --> 00:28:59.521
uh,

1148
00:28:59.521 --> 00:29:02.960
in Santa Tn and not been in Leone.

1149
00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:04.190
And in my essay,

1150
00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:04.970
uh,

1151
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:09.970
and even an attempt to in Bole Dole and Paris keeps waiting for these armies to,

1152
00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:12.540
of citizens to come,

1153
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.260
uh,

1154
00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:14.430
and sit to a yen,

1155
00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:18.060
female citizens also to come and rescue them.

1156
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.440
But in the meantime,

1157
00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:23.190
you've got people from the northern and northeastern quarters of Paris,

1158
00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:27.900
the poor living on the edge of Paris who come down into the fancy quarters for

1159
00:29:27.901 --> 00:29:30.240
the very first time or not working in someone's made.

1160
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.820
And they summit and the painter,

1161
00:29:32.821 --> 00:29:33.780
Gustave Courbet,

1162
00:29:33.781 --> 00:29:35.040
Gustava Cool Bay,

1163
00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:38.040
the naturalist painter from near Bezos,

1164
00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:38.850
Saul,

1165
00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:40.650
thus burial at or no,

1166
00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:41.470
uh,

1167
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:42.250
he says,

1168
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:43.350
why don't we as a sim,

1169
00:29:43.351 --> 00:29:48.351
we'll get rid of this horrible statue of Napoleon that standing on the Vendome

1170
00:29:48.461 --> 00:29:49.294
column.

1171
00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:51.070
And the Plus Vendome,

1172
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:54.310
the platform dorm was and neuropathy royale,

1173
00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:55.420
very fancy.

1174
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:58.380
It's known to Americans who have visited there,

1175
00:29:58.390 --> 00:29:59.850
many but others because that's the,

1176
00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:01.480
the Ritz hotel where,

1177
00:30:01.481 --> 00:30:01.870
uh,

1178
00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:03.520
what's her name of Princess Diana left,

1179
00:30:03.521 --> 00:30:03.701
you know,

1180
00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:07.810
10 years ago now and never made it unfortunately for her out of the polling

1181
00:30:07.811 --> 00:30:08.040
data.

1182
00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.730
Ma I the tunnel,

1183
00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:10.181
he says,

1184
00:30:10.181 --> 00:30:11.710
let's tear the whole damn thing down.

1185
00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:12.910
And so this is,

1186
00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:13.470
uh,

1187
00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:13.730
uh,

1188
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:14.150
this is,

1189
00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:14.390
uh,

1190
00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:16.790
an entry pass to see this,

1191
00:30:16.791 --> 00:30:19.550
to see this thing brought down as a symbol of,

1192
00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.470
of centralized oppression.

1193
00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.870
And this is the whoops cheese.

1194
00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:25.460
This is the result.

1195
00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:26.590
This is the crashing.

1196
00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:27.950
And so people would come down,

1197
00:30:27.951 --> 00:30:31.040
they'd have their pictures taken with a picture as if it was the part of the

1198
00:30:31.041 --> 00:30:34.880
true cross of the crashed VOD dome column.

1199
00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:38.930
Because for once they had one for once,

1200
00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.310
they had one.

1201
00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:43.790
And so they have to defend Paris.

1202
00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:47.990
And so you've got all these cannons that you just saw before and you've got,

1203
00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:48.321
you know,

1204
00:30:48.321 --> 00:30:48.571
they,

1205
00:30:48.571 --> 00:30:51.620
they still have their uniforms and they build these huge barricades.

1206
00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:52.580
The first barricades,

1207
00:30:52.581 --> 00:30:52.911
by the way,

1208
00:30:52.911 --> 00:30:55.820
we're built in Paris in the late 16th century.

1209
00:30:56.150 --> 00:31:00.260
So there's a long tradition and you could build barricades across smaller

1210
00:31:00.261 --> 00:31:02.660
streets but not across big boulevards.

1211
00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:06.080
And that was part of the rebuilding of Paris and the 1850s and sixties more

1212
00:31:06.081 --> 00:31:09.760
about that in a minute and much more about it that later cause it's fascinating.

1213
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.380
These I think is fascinating.

1214
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:13.900
And here you go right down by the sin.

1215
00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:14.591
You know,

1216
00:31:14.591 --> 00:31:15.520
there's a,

1217
00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.810
there's some Monet and money pains both had that are further back from further

1218
00:31:19.811 --> 00:31:21.160
back looking over here.

1219
00:31:21.161 --> 00:31:24.760
You've got your basic barricade and these things are torn up.

1220
00:31:24.761 --> 00:31:24.941
You know,

1221
00:31:24.941 --> 00:31:25.930
these are were trees.

1222
00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:31.300
It came out of [inaudible] and as a 1968 and here's your sort of kiosk of

1223
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:32.800
modernity.

1224
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:33.371
You know,

1225
00:31:33.371 --> 00:31:38.371
somebody selling a newspaper's on these boulevards or near these boulevards and

1226
00:31:38.441 --> 00:31:43.330
here are some of these people and most of them would be dead within a month of,

1227
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.433
of this,

1228
00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:44.981
uh,

1229
00:31:44.981 --> 00:31:46.180
of this photo.

1230
00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:50.260
And there you are looking at them trying to,

1231
00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:50.690
uh,

1232
00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:51.550
protect,

1233
00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:52.140
uh,

1234
00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.250
trying to protect their city.

1235
00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:55.873
Now,

1236
00:31:58.540 --> 00:31:59.490
now who,

1237
00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:00.900
first of all,

1238
00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:01.380
what,

1239
00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:02.790
who were the Columbia now who are,

1240
00:32:02.791 --> 00:32:04.080
who are the people that was the left?

1241
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:04.950
Well,

1242
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:05.191
you know,

1243
00:32:05.191 --> 00:32:06.024
when,

1244
00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:07.660
when revolutions are Victoria,

1245
00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.340
everybody rushes forward and says it.

1246
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.750
They laugh.

1247
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.901
You know,

1248
00:32:09.901 --> 00:32:12.860
I was there and they give their name and their address and,

1249
00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:13.531
and you know,

1250
00:32:13.531 --> 00:32:15.170
why don't you reward me or at least a beat,

1251
00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.350
pay attention to the fact that I,

1252
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:17.610
that I was there in Paris,

1253
00:32:17.611 --> 00:32:21.350
you've got the victory column of the Revolution of 1830 where the bus teed,

1254
00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:25.350
wants dead as a student has got the names of all the people that were killed,

1255
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:26.040
uh,

1256
00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.080
in three days of July,

1257
00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:28.230
1830.

1258
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:29.460
But in something like this,

1259
00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:29.820
you,

1260
00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.560
you have a body count of it,

1261
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:34.260
more than 15,000 people.

1262
00:32:34.261 --> 00:32:35.640
So we know who the academy now were.

1263
00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.110
There were ordinary people.

1264
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:38.790
There were the ordinary workers,

1265
00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:39.650
uh,

1266
00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:40.010
uh,

1267
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.110
men and women who simply couldn't get out.

1268
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:45.140
They weren't all socialists,

1269
00:32:45.141 --> 00:32:45.591
as I said,

1270
00:32:45.591 --> 00:32:46.430
some more anarchist,

1271
00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:47.630
some are moderate Republicans,

1272
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:48.381
but they were,

1273
00:32:48.381 --> 00:32:49.940
who were left.

1274
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:50.840
Um,

1275
00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:51.561
they were,

1276
00:32:51.561 --> 00:32:51.780
uh,

1277
00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:53.370
their very presence there.

1278
00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:53.720
I'd be,

1279
00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:54.553
that's where they lived.

1280
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:55.521
But they're defensive.

1281
00:32:55.521 --> 00:33:00.200
Paris reflects tensions between urban France and conservative rural France.

1282
00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:00.620
Uh,

1283
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.300
the armies that they were opposing,

1284
00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:03.470
the French armies,

1285
00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:03.950
uh,

1286
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:04.400
were,

1287
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:04.670
uh,

1288
00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:08.630
largely staffed by peasants from conservative areas or from national guards

1289
00:33:08.631 --> 00:33:13.631
broadened from towns like vine or ava or all sorts of places that are brought

1290
00:33:13.671 --> 00:33:14.330
in.

1291
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:14.540
Uh,

1292
00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:15.530
and so the Commun,

1293
00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:15.951
you know,

1294
00:33:15.951 --> 00:33:16.191
it's,

1295
00:33:16.191 --> 00:33:18.710
it's somewhat semi proletarian.

1296
00:33:18.711 --> 00:33:20.060
They're mostly working people.

1297
00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:23.240
They're particularly people from the poorer quarters of the north and the

1298
00:33:23.241 --> 00:33:24.074
northeast.

1299
00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:25.520
More about that later.

1300
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:26.240
Uh,

1301
00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.070
they are who w,

1302
00:33:28.071 --> 00:33:28.251
you know,

1303
00:33:28.251 --> 00:33:29.300
the people that were left,

1304
00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:30.590
they are artisans,

1305
00:33:30.591 --> 00:33:31.490
craftsmen,

1306
00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:33.110
a day laborers,

1307
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:34.670
domestic servants.

1308
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:35.360
Uh,

1309
00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.760
they are the people who were left.

1310
00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.640
And what they were trying to do is imagine a world,

1311
00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:41.360
uh,

1312
00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:41.691
uh,

1313
00:33:41.691 --> 00:33:41.991
you know,

1314
00:33:41.991 --> 00:33:44.630
a new world in which would be less centralized,

1315
00:33:44.631 --> 00:33:45.590
but for the socialists,

1316
00:33:45.591 --> 00:33:47.090
they wanted more centralization.

1317
00:33:47.091 --> 00:33:48.680
So it was a very complex,

1318
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:49.670
complex,

1319
00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:50.201
uh,

1320
00:33:50.201 --> 00:33:50.571
uh,

1321
00:33:50.571 --> 00:33:51.340
period.

1322
00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:51.470
Uh,

1323
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:52.303
indeed,

1324
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:53.270
but it reflects,

1325
00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:53.720
uh,

1326
00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:56.660
the artist and we'll base that was still part of,

1327
00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:57.693
uh,

1328
00:33:58.170 --> 00:33:58.671
part of the,

1329
00:33:58.671 --> 00:33:58.881
of,

1330
00:33:58.881 --> 00:33:59.181
of,

1331
00:33:59.181 --> 00:33:59.541
of,

1332
00:33:59.541 --> 00:33:59.710
uh,

1333
00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:00.543
uh,

1334
00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:01.403
uh,

1335
00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.060
of the,

1336
00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:03.530
of the French economy for sure.

1337
00:34:03.531 --> 00:34:03.801
With it,

1338
00:34:03.801 --> 00:34:06.470
with the emphasis on skilled production of,

1339
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:07.101
of,

1340
00:34:07.101 --> 00:34:07.550
uh,

1341
00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:07.940
of,

1342
00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:12.940
of handbags and of gloves and a finely crafted tables.

1343
00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:14.030
Uh,

1344
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:17.000
the cabinet makers were always terribly important in the French revolution and

1345
00:34:17.001 --> 00:34:17.834
they still are,

1346
00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.010
and they're still all the stores,

1347
00:34:19.011 --> 00:34:22.400
but most of the stores on one particular street in Paris near the busty are

1348
00:34:22.401 --> 00:34:24.830
still a furniture store stores.

1349
00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:25.710
Um,

1350
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:28.760
and the kind of myth of the commune was of course that,

1351
00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:29.240
uh,

1352
00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:32.120
from the conservative point of view is that these were the furious of hell.

1353
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:35.510
The men and the women who rose up to slay their social betters.

1354
00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:36.260
Well,

1355
00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:37.400
of course that's not the case.

1356
00:34:37.401 --> 00:34:39.770
That's a sort of myth for the French Revolution as well.

1357
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:41.180
And then you had your basic,

1358
00:34:41.181 --> 00:34:45.020
a republican interpretation is that they were defending the republic against

1359
00:34:45.021 --> 00:34:47.750
this sort of a monarchy to be restored.

1360
00:34:47.751 --> 00:34:50.420
And that certainly is part of that,

1361
00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:51.130
uh,

1362
00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:52.220
as well.

1363
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.671
Uh,

1364
00:34:52.671 --> 00:34:55.280
but it also had its socialists component and,

1365
00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:55.621
and,

1366
00:34:55.621 --> 00:34:58.100
and marks for Marxists was terribly important.

1367
00:34:58.101 --> 00:34:59.900
And for lending it was as well.

1368
00:34:59.901 --> 00:35:00.734
It seemed to be,

1369
00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:01.310
uh,

1370
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:03.350
Armageddon for the ruling classes.

1371
00:35:03.351 --> 00:35:05.990
But it seemed to be here was this proletariat,

1372
00:35:05.991 --> 00:35:07.370
even though Mark's got that all wrong,

1373
00:35:07.371 --> 00:35:10.190
because these are not industrial workers for the most part,

1374
00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:13.800
but these are the workers that one day break off their change chains.

1375
00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:16.130
And so you can see how this would have an impact on,

1376
00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:16.700
uh,

1377
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:17.091
uh,

1378
00:35:17.091 --> 00:35:17.571
on,

1379
00:35:17.571 --> 00:35:17.870
uh,

1380
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:19.760
every country on the United States.

1381
00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:20.240
Uh,

1382
00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.590
those who taken American history.

1383
00:35:21.591 --> 00:35:21.831
I mean,

1384
00:35:21.831 --> 00:35:23.120
this sort of view that the,

1385
00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:23.851
that the,

1386
00:35:23.851 --> 00:35:28.010
that immigrants were increasingly bringing a socialism and anarchism to the

1387
00:35:28.011 --> 00:35:28.844
United States.

1388
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:29.061
Uh,

1389
00:35:29.061 --> 00:35:31.730
the communism important in the big Hay market affair,

1390
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:33.560
the collective memory of the Commun,

1391
00:35:33.561 --> 00:35:35.600
the Haymarket affair in Chicago,

1392
00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.590
and that people hung there in,

1393
00:35:37.591 --> 00:35:37.801
in,

1394
00:35:37.801 --> 00:35:38.520
when was it,

1395
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.900
1886.

1396
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.890
Um,

1397
00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:42.180
but the most important,

1398
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.140
uh,

1399
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.340
really the most,

1400
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:45.750
the most important,

1401
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:47.063
uh,

1402
00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:49.710
result of it was the massacre,

1403
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:50.820
I think itself,

1404
00:35:50.821 --> 00:35:52.800
because when finally the troops,

1405
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:53.320
uh,

1406
00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:56.760
of the provisional government come pouring through the western gate,

1407
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.860
a gate that essentially been left open,

1408
00:35:59.350 --> 00:35:59.970
uh,

1409
00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:01.340
in a place called Posse,

1410
00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:03.690
where there's some very nice art nouveau buildings by the way,

1411
00:36:03.691 --> 00:36:06.480
but which was very collaborationist also in World War II.

1412
00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:07.680
They're not everybody.

1413
00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.310
Uh,

1414
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:13.310
what they do the troops do is they use the boulevards that had been built by

1415
00:36:14.731 --> 00:36:15.331
Napoleon,

1416
00:36:15.331 --> 00:36:20.331
the third as a way of getting to those working class neighborhoods that had

1417
00:36:21.931 --> 00:36:25.470
always risen up and Napoleon the third and his,

1418
00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:28.890
a prefect of the sin and a name you don't have to remember now,

1419
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.630
but sometime of be nice to remember called Oh,

1420
00:36:30.631 --> 00:36:32.110
Smollen a name.

1421
00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:32.953
So important,

1422
00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:33.480
uh,

1423
00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.430
that it became a verb to ost man.

1424
00:36:35.431 --> 00:36:36.960
Something was to bulldoze it.

1425
00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.010
A man,

1426
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:40.800
this to by my late friend Richard Cobb is the l station,

1427
00:36:40.801 --> 00:36:41.634
a Tila.

1428
00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:46.430
He had plowed through working class neighborhoods and built the boulevards that

1429
00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:51.450
w of the modern Paris that one celebrates and where one's celebrates.

1430
00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.220
He did it to bring more light.

1431
00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.590
He did it to bring more air.

1432
00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:59.700
He did it to free the flow for capital money.

1433
00:36:59.701 --> 00:37:01.980
That's the department stores are on the boulevards.

1434
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:03.510
I'll do this again,

1435
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:04.711
not this whole lecture,

1436
00:37:04.711 --> 00:37:06.030
but that part again.

1437
00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:11.480
And he did it because you can't build barricades across boulevards wide ones.

1438
00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.580
1944 August,

1439
00:37:14.581 --> 00:37:16.890
we jump ahead the boulevard.

1440
00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:22.010
The barricades are across the same streets where they were in many cases in 1792

1441
00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:28.640
and in 1789 and the problem 1968 it was very hard to build a barricade across

1442
00:37:30.091 --> 00:37:31.410
the boulevard San Michelle,

1443
00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:33.360
which was built by Rosemont at this time.

1444
00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.370
So the troops come pouring in.

1445
00:37:35.371 --> 00:37:37.050
This is down the route of [inaudible],

1446
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.380
which was completed in the 1850s and sixties.

1447
00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.630
And the damage is staggering.

1448
00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:44.580
This is the Church of the Madeleine,

1449
00:37:44.581 --> 00:37:45.600
which is still there.

1450
00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:47.610
This is the rule royale.

1451
00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.140
These treats do not matter.

1452
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:54.470
It's just the visual images with what is really going on that counts the hotel

1453
00:37:55.111 --> 00:37:55.944
de Ville,

1454
00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:57.000
which was destroyed.

1455
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:58.410
Interestingly enough,

1456
00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:59.850
10 years ago,

1457
00:37:59.851 --> 00:38:04.440
somebody found photos taken by this Parisian of the siege and the commune in the

1458
00:38:04.441 --> 00:38:05.430
back of the Hotel Ville.

1459
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:07.080
They were found 10 years ago.

1460
00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:08.071
They had survived.

1461
00:38:08.071 --> 00:38:11.040
I just saw an exposition of them at the end of the tech guy used to it because

1462
00:38:11.041 --> 00:38:11.880
I've used the puppy in,

1463
00:38:11.881 --> 00:38:13.290
in January of,

1464
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:13.520
of,

1465
00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.600
of photos that had never been seen before.

1466
00:38:15.601 --> 00:38:16.021
But anyway,

1467
00:38:16.021 --> 00:38:16.680
this is,

1468
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.040
uh,

1469
00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:17.621
this is the,

1470
00:38:17.621 --> 00:38:17.760
the,

1471
00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.200
the hotel,

1472
00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:18.591
the visa,

1473
00:38:18.591 --> 00:38:21.050
which is down by notes to dom though it's not an CTA,

1474
00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:22.470
don't worry about these places.

1475
00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:24.720
And then they put the women on trial.

1476
00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:29.580
There had been a rumor that female incendiaries in French,

1477
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:29.941
they,

1478
00:38:29.941 --> 00:38:34.941
Petro Lewis had been setting fire to fancy houses and had been burning down the

1479
00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:38.800
Bank of France.

1480
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:44.910
And so the rumor was part of the fear of quote unquote uppity women putting

1481
00:38:47.411 --> 00:38:52.411
forth demands and they squished them like grapes and they hauled them off and

1482
00:38:52.991 --> 00:38:55.300
shot them going.

1483
00:38:55.301 --> 00:38:55.660
Cool.

1484
00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:56.291
One of the writers,

1485
00:38:56.291 --> 00:38:56.890
they're going core,

1486
00:38:56.890 --> 00:39:00.400
the one that when it hadn't died yet was no friend of ordinary people.

1487
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:03.910
But there's an amazing scene in his memoirs when he's down by the hotel,

1488
00:39:03.911 --> 00:39:04.040
the,

1489
00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:08.080
the sees these women chained together being walked around and he says,

1490
00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:08.501
well,

1491
00:39:08.501 --> 00:39:09.334
what,

1492
00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.280
where are they going instead of the guy next to him says,

1493
00:39:12.281 --> 00:39:13.114
well,

1494
00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.073
they're going to shoot him.

1495
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:15.910
So what do you mean going to shoot him?

1496
00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:21.190
You didn't shoot women do they with a debt?

1497
00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:22.690
And he describes it.

1498
00:39:22.691 --> 00:39:23.770
It's terrifying.

1499
00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.340
I used to read it.

1500
00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:26.320
I could never get through it.

1501
00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:27.970
It's terrifying.

1502
00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.820
And then he hears the Kuda glasses,

1503
00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:34.000
the shots one after another and then he sees a priest staggering out,

1504
00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:38.170
overwhelmed by it all and then he moves on to something else.

1505
00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.170
The execution.

1506
00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:45.220
This is my ne who is horrified by the whole thing.

1507
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.221
Uh,

1508
00:39:46.221 --> 00:39:47.350
my name wasn't there.

1509
00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:49.240
Kobe also did,

1510
00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:50.230
uh,

1511
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.680
uh,

1512
00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.360
an ex execution scene.

1513
00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.080
And in the end what there was,

1514
00:39:56.081 --> 00:39:58.420
was this a thought,

1515
00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:02.620
he tuned them on that they could bop Paris.

1516
00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:05.560
Everybody was guilty,

1517
00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:07.570
little coffin.

1518
00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:09.460
People were smaller.

1519
00:40:09.461 --> 00:40:14.461
Then you can still see in the Pantanal this our secular monument to to some very

1520
00:40:14.951 --> 00:40:17.060
wonderful people like a immune soda.

1521
00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:21.730
But also you don't just Napoleonic generals one after another.

1522
00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:25.840
You can still see bullet holes there from the commune,

1523
00:40:25.841 --> 00:40:27.190
not just from World War Two,

1524
00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.560
from where were people were executed.

1525
00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:30.551
And they,

1526
00:40:30.551 --> 00:40:34.150
lots of people who are chimney sweeps where executed because they had a,

1527
00:40:34.151 --> 00:40:36.400
they had been cleaning chimneys and they had guns.

1528
00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:36.941
The equivalent,

1529
00:40:36.941 --> 00:40:38.500
they had charcoal on their,

1530
00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:39.180
on their cheeks.

1531
00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:39.461
They would,

1532
00:40:39.461 --> 00:40:39.841
people would,

1533
00:40:39.841 --> 00:40:44.320
they would rip off your shirt to see if you had a bruise from a recoiling rifle.

1534
00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:45.521
And they,

1535
00:40:45.521 --> 00:40:46.570
it wasn't just,

1536
00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:47.770
you know,

1537
00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:50.830
it wasn't a neutral massacre what it was.

1538
00:40:50.831 --> 00:40:52.570
They went areas of pair of Paris,

1539
00:40:52.571 --> 00:40:53.380
like Bellevue,

1540
00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.510
which is in the north east,

1541
00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:59.650
which had long been assumed to be a radical place and more Masa.

1542
00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:03.820
And that's where their collective memory of the forces of orders they liked to

1543
00:41:03.821 --> 00:41:04.654
call it,

1544
00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:05.410
uh,

1545
00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:06.310
was very,

1546
00:41:06.311 --> 00:41:07.690
very precise.

1547
00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.750
And that's where they went in and massacred them.

1548
00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:12.370
And that is,

1549
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:12.970
uh,

1550
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:13.810
the most chilling,

1551
00:41:13.811 --> 00:41:14.860
probably legacy,

1552
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.700
uh,

1553
00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:16.201
of the,

1554
00:41:16.201 --> 00:41:16.341
uh,

1555
00:41:16.341 --> 00:41:17.770
of the whole thing.

1556
00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:20.800
Now I know it's easy to look at me and say,

1557
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:21.491
God,

1558
00:41:21.491 --> 00:41:22.750
there's an old lefty.

1559
00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:23.561
You know,

1560
00:41:23.561 --> 00:41:25.150
why isn't the draw?

1561
00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:25.870
That's,

1562
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:26.780
my wife says sometimes,

1563
00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:27.693
why don't you grow up,

1564
00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:28.960
but why don't you,

1565
00:41:28.961 --> 00:41:29.171
you know,

1566
00:41:29.171 --> 00:41:30.070
get over this.

1567
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:30.431
You know,

1568
00:41:30.431 --> 00:41:32.080
I remember when I was a,

1569
00:41:32.081 --> 00:41:32.261
you know,

1570
00:41:32.261 --> 00:41:33.130
a student in Paris,

1571
00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:34.220
I remember going up to,

1572
00:41:34.221 --> 00:41:34.880
uh,

1573
00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:35.420
um,

1574
00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:39.110
there's a place that peerless has cemetery and there's the wall of the fit of,

1575
00:41:39.111 --> 00:41:39.590
hey,

1576
00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:41.060
it's called the wall of the federates.

1577
00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:44.390
And that's where they massacred lots of people and people used to go up there on

1578
00:41:44.391 --> 00:41:49.391
May Day and sometimes on the anniversary of the commune just to see where these

1579
00:41:49.521 --> 00:41:53.000
people fell with enormous more dignity than the people who,

1580
00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:53.990
who shot them.

1581
00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:59.410
And this was the ultimate lesson of the commune that would hang over Europe for

1582
00:42:01.731 --> 00:42:02.241
the left.

1583
00:42:02.241 --> 00:42:03.680
It was assigned that that the,

1584
00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:05.300
that the state is strong,

1585
00:42:05.301 --> 00:42:07.340
powerful and can be vicious.

1586
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:12.820
Don't let anyone ever tell you that the victims of terrorism in any century are

1587
00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:14.900
any,

1588
00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:15.121
any,

1589
00:42:15.121 --> 00:42:19.250
were proximately near the victims of state terrorism.

1590
00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:24.230
No matter how awful terrorism was in the anarchist attacks in the end of the

1591
00:42:24.231 --> 00:42:28.060
1890s at the beginning of the 1890s I'm going to talk to you about it cause I,

1592
00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:29.330
I'm interested in them.

1593
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:34.930
But this was the real lesson of all of this as the state ever more stronger in

1594
00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:40.530
Europe since the consolidation of territorial monarchies in the,

1595
00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.200
in the 15th century,

1596
00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:47.830
the state growing in power with absolutism growing and power with the revolution

1597
00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:52.910
with Napoleon growing in power with the unification of national states,

1598
00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:58.300
the state could strike back with unparalleled savagery against those people who

1599
00:42:58.521 --> 00:42:59.354
got in a way.

1600
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:05.470
And that's what happened at the commune in the Paris commune.

1601
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:07.940
How many people died?

1602
00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:09.530
Minimum estimate,

1603
00:43:09.531 --> 00:43:10.670
15,000,

1604
00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:13.070
probably closer to 25,000.

1605
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:17.840
Yet when they did the census of 1872 in Paris alone,

1606
00:43:17.841 --> 00:43:21.380
there were 10,000 less shoemakers than there had been before.

1607
00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:27.310
Shoemakers were an extraordinarily radical trade where they all hiding in their

1608
00:43:27.981 --> 00:43:29.270
aunt's house in early on.

1609
00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:31.083
Where were they?

1610
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:32.181
You know,

1611
00:43:32.181 --> 00:43:34.010
th th the flames in golf,

1612
00:43:34.011 --> 00:43:34.940
the bodies,

1613
00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.770
they were gone and the amnesty for the Columbia.

1614
00:43:39.771 --> 00:43:41.300
Now the people in the commune,

1615
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.660
uh,

1616
00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:46.660
wouldn't come til 1879 but it hung like a shadow over European politics and

1617
00:43:49.881 --> 00:43:53.600
French politics for years and years.

1618
00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:55.080
And you know there's a,

1619
00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.390
when you go up there,

1620
00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:57.130
when you,

1621
00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:58.460
if you go up to my mouth,

1622
00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:01.310
it's incredible because I was there once very,

1623
00:44:01.311 --> 00:44:02.840
very late in the afternoon.

1624
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:04.161
And oddly enough,

1625
00:44:04.161 --> 00:44:06.500
I met this woman who went there every day and I said,

1626
00:44:06.501 --> 00:44:07.790
why you go there every day?

1627
00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:10.820
And she said she had some sort of lung disease and she couldn't get out of

1628
00:44:10.821 --> 00:44:11.181
Paris,

1629
00:44:11.181 --> 00:44:13.130
but she could go into perilous sheds.

1630
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.020
And she knew where every tune was.

1631
00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:18.470
And she took us up to see the wall of the federation.

1632
00:44:18.471 --> 00:44:21.170
I was some with some friends when my mother long ago.

1633
00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:25.550
And I remember looking at that and just thinking,

1634
00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:26.750
I remember when I was a kid,

1635
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:29.780
I read this book by Thomas Wolf called look,

1636
00:44:29.781 --> 00:44:30.710
homeward angel.

1637
00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:32.970
And in the end he says,

1638
00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:33.680
as he say,

1639
00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:33.870
said,

1640
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:34.051
Oh,

1641
00:44:34.051 --> 00:44:34.890
lost.

1642
00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:39.330
And by the wind grieved ghost come back again.

1643
00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:41.450
That was the communist.

1644
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:44.160
And we're going to go onto the state next time.

1645
00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:46.080
Have a good day.
