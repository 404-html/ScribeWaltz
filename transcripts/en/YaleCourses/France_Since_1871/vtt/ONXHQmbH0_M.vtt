1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:01.561
Okay.

2
00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:03.330
I want today to talk about,

3
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.990
um,

4
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.100
two very well known,

5
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.953
um,

6
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:06.803
crises.

7
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.720
I in the third republic,

8
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.793
uh,

9
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.720
one is the Buddha on j affair,

10
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.960
and the second is the more well known,

11
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.651
uh,

12
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:17.610
the Dreyfus affair.

13
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.383
Um,

14
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.360
and I guess what makes the drivers a fair bit more poignant is that I is that

15
00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:25.141
Alfred Dreyfus,

16
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:26.250
his granddaughter,

17
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.640
I died at Auschwitz in 1944 I think.

18
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.331
So,

19
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:34.164
um,

20
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.980
and the context for this is to,

21
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.700
most of the time I'm going to talk with a on j affair and,

22
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:41.961
uh,

23
00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:45.510
and in a way that sets up the Dreyfus affair because the Dreyfus affair is more

24
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:46.344
well known,

25
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.190
but,

26
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.671
uh,

27
00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:49.550
I agree with interpretation of used the blue,

28
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.930
the Honcho Fair bluejay affair as,

29
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.670
uh,

30
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.510
the emergence of a,

31
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.490
the far right,

32
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.970
uh,

33
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.530
in France,

34
00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.390
uh,

35
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.210
uh,

36
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.470
events that parallel,

37
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:02.180
for example,

38
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.060
the rise of,

39
00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:03.894
of uh,

40
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.381
uh,

41
00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:05.220
the far right in,

42
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:09.060
in Austria and in other places as well.

43
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.310
And particularly this was a propaganda campaign.

44
00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:12.390
The antisemitism,

45
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.170
uh,

46
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.280
and the sort of street thug tactics are rather similar to,

47
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.090
uh,

48
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.030
to movements that we would become all too familiar with.

49
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.170
Uh,

50
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.741
and I personally,

51
00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:23.071
of course,

52
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:24.480
but in the 1920s,

53
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.080
in 1930.

54
00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:27.870
So that's what I want to talk about today.

55
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.420
And the background of this is of course,

56
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.100
the rise of antisemitism,

57
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.333
uh,

58
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.410
workable one unleashed the demons of the 20th century to a great extent.

59
00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:38.580
There's no question about that.

60
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.170
Uh,

61
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.290
for an out of Hitler.

62
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:40.641
It,

63
00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:42.280
it transformed it I,

64
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.320
his Auntie,

65
00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:43.930
uh,

66
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:44.670
uh,

67
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.790
anti socialism and subsequent anti-communism,

68
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:48.360
uh,

69
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.601
uh,

70
00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:49.920
into a frenzy,

71
00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:53.750
but it added that dimension that was the most pernicious aspect of,

72
00:01:53.751 --> 00:01:54.290
uh,

73
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.690
uh,

74
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:55.860
his horrible existence,

75
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.340
uh,

76
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.110
which was a antisemitism,

77
00:01:58.111 --> 00:01:59.820
but antisemitism was already out there.

78
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.811
Uh,

79
00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:01.351
and,

80
00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:01.611
uh,

81
00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:02.670
at Karl Luber,

82
00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:03.750
who was the mayor of Vienna,

83
00:02:03.751 --> 00:02:04.410
said,

84
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.790
I decide who's a Jew.

85
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.130
A and the old liberal,

86
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:08.730
uh,

87
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.851
uh,

88
00:02:08.851 --> 00:02:09.720
old liberal,

89
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:12.870
a vns or have disappeared in the surf frenzy of antisemitism.

90
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.560
Well,

91
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.520
antisemitism,

92
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.660
it was characterized.

93
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.260
Uh,

94
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.093
uh,

95
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:18.680
unfortunately the,

96
00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:19.170
uh,

97
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.010
many centuries,

98
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.570
uh,

99
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.790
uh,

100
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:21.630
in Europe,

101
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.931
uh,

102
00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:25.890
and certainly the third republic did not invent antisemitism in France either.

103
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:26.610
There were,

104
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.210
uh,

105
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.361
uh,

106
00:02:27.361 --> 00:02:29.670
riots against Jews after 1848.

107
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.211
There were,

108
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:30.650
uh,

109
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.810
uh,

110
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.360
one of the members of the committee of public safety in the French Revolution

111
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.410
who's from Alsace,

112
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.891
uh,

113
00:02:34.891 --> 00:02:36.000
where there were lots of Jews,

114
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.510
uh,

115
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.130
was extraordinarily antisemitic.

116
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.761
Uh,

117
00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:39.471
and all of this,

118
00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:40.740
this is a sadly,

119
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.260
uh,

120
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.670
uh,

121
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.503
sadly no,

122
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.720
but certainly the political dimensions of antisemitism in the eighties and

123
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.360
nineties,

124
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.300
uh,

125
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.830
help explain the intensity of these two big affairs.

126
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.690
And for the Dreyfus affair,

127
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.450
it was so important and so wrenching or that simply where people simply refer to

128
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:02.380
it as la fare,

129
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.100
the affair because it was so,

130
00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:06.220
it preoccupied,

131
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:07.000
uh,

132
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.451
uh,

133
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:08.370
he preoccupied,

134
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.493
uh,

135
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.460
a dinner table discussions and brawls,

136
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.710
uh,

137
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.930
uh,

138
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:13.590
political,

139
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.050
uh,

140
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.420
newspapers and everything else for a very long time.

141
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.111
Now,

142
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:18.190
in addition to,

143
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.970
um,

144
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.210
the sort of growth of antisemitism,

145
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.083
um,

146
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.953
uh,

147
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.980
continued growth in France and other places,

148
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.461
uh,

149
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:30.250
the other part of the context that needs to be briefly explained,

150
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.020
it has two dimensions.

151
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.753
First,

152
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.190
uh,

153
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.400
there was the question of revenge,

154
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.460
of,

155
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.560
of vengeance,

156
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.450
of the recapture of,

157
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.261
of,

158
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:41.650
um,

159
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.483
of Alsace,

160
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.821
uh,

161
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:46.780
and the parts of Lohan that had been so rudely a snatch to way.

162
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.010
Um,

163
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.660
it's possible to exaggerate.

164
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:50.111
Of course,

165
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:52.210
the impact is one of my former students,

166
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.420
uh,

167
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.890
Rachel crestal has argued,

168
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.560
uh,

169
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.840
of revolt,

170
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.520
Angie's Ma revenge,

171
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.031
uh,

172
00:03:58.031 --> 00:03:58.864
thinking,

173
00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.190
uh,

174
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.090
on French political life,

175
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.330
uh,

176
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.980
in,

177
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:02.200
uh,

178
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.800
the seventh and the 1870s and eighties,

179
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:06.663
eighties.

180
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.150
Uh,

181
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.970
but by the end of the 1880s,

182
00:04:09.971 --> 00:04:12.910
it's still is an important part in political thinking.

183
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:14.980
And that the and brutal on Jay's campaign,

184
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.430
uh,

185
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.750
reflected that fact.

186
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.510
And the second is that a,

187
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:24.511
the second of aspect of background is the perceived weakness of the Republican

188
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:26.284
government,

189
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.131
uh,

190
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:27.671
in that,

191
00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:30.910
in order to protect France against Caesar Rhythm,

192
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.020
which I've explained before,

193
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:32.854
was the fear of,

194
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:33.310
you know,

195
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.760
who knows another Napoleon or some sort of strong leader,

196
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:38.220
a riding a horse and,

197
00:04:38.221 --> 00:04:38.501
and,

198
00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:38.861
and,

199
00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:39.220
uh,

200
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.630
starting wars,

201
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.740
um,

202
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.050
or repressing a,

203
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.130
their own people rather like a Napoleon.

204
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.180
The third had done,

205
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.721
uh,

206
00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:49.660
they create a constitutional framework that,

207
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.500
uh,

208
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.320
invest power in the Chamber of deputies basically.

209
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.981
And the,

210
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:55.750
and the Shama did deputy is,

211
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.181
uh,

212
00:04:56.181 --> 00:04:57.220
a political club,

213
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.630
which I've said before,

214
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.260
and the same members are often return to year after year.

215
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:02.681
The same.

216
00:05:02.681 --> 00:05:07.250
Bribes are given big costs of wine or barrels of wine or put up a,

217
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.570
uh,

218
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.961
near,

219
00:05:07.961 --> 00:05:08.290
uh,

220
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.670
a voting booth and,

221
00:05:09.671 --> 00:05:10.580
and everything,

222
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.930
uh,

223
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:11.741
proceeds,

224
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:15.190
at least this is the popular in the popular imagination,

225
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.581
uh,

226
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:16.150
as,

227
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.330
uh,

228
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.880
a political club of swinging door,

229
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.181
uh,

230
00:05:19.181 --> 00:05:20.050
ministries.

231
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.063
And certainly,

232
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.790
um,

233
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:22.091
you know,

234
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:25.840
if you look at just take 1889 to 1893,

235
00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:25.991
and,

236
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:26.200
you know,

237
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.510
not responsible for this because I mean basically who cares,

238
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:28.721
but,

239
00:05:28.721 --> 00:05:28.931
but,

240
00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:29.440
uh,

241
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.561
uh,

242
00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:30.394
about the,

243
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.240
these details,

244
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.450
but they're 546 different sessions between 1889 in 1893,

245
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.660
873 bills introduced I between 93 98 or 633 sessions with 1,112 bills with the

246
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:48.550
government,

247
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.790
uh,

248
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.020
presenting on its own,

249
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.360
well over 2000.

250
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.141
But in fact,

251
00:05:53.141 --> 00:05:56.160
if you look at the accomplishments besides providing,

252
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.230
you know,

253
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.640
a certain stability,

254
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:02.420
the accomplishments seem to be rather pale when,

255
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.900
ah,

256
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.980
you've got people both on the left and the right thing saying that the big issue

257
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:09.830
is over there and over there is to,

258
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:10.220
uh,

259
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.610
in the east of what had been France that is Alsace.

260
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:14.510
Uh,

261
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.140
and,

262
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.470
uh,

263
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.303
Lauren,

264
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.230
I and Clay's each bill,

265
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:21.680
we had to be discussed by a whole commission of Deputies and then went on and

266
00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:22.400
on,

267
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.880
uh,

268
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:22.971
uh,

269
00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:25.370
commissions or become sort of mini ministries.

270
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.200
Uh,

271
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.580
the,

272
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.950
the perception is that,

273
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:28.131
that,

274
00:06:28.131 --> 00:06:30.200
that this is an impotent system.

275
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.390
It's an empathy system that's condemned France to be less than virile.

276
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.021
And remember,

277
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:37.490
this is the time when the population,

278
00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:40.520
people are becoming very afraid of the fact that the population is not

279
00:06:40.521 --> 00:06:41.960
reproducing itself.

280
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.100
Uh,

281
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.760
so,

282
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.911
uh,

283
00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:45.260
this is one of,

284
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.090
of the big,

285
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.923
um,

286
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.980
images of simply,

287
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:49.720
um,

288
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.090
uh,

289
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.500
eh,

290
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:50.820
eh,

291
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:51.860
instability.

292
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.581
Uh,

293
00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:54.110
and it's the same people.

294
00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:54.950
It's the same,

295
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.101
uh,

296
00:06:55.101 --> 00:06:58.670
ministries that are reconstituted rather like Italian politics.

297
00:06:58.671 --> 00:06:59.700
And it's as much of the,

298
00:06:59.701 --> 00:07:00.041
of the,

299
00:07:00.041 --> 00:07:00.890
of the pre,

300
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.230
the post World War II era.

301
00:07:03.231 --> 00:07:06.860
There were 180 ministries between 1870,

302
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.491
uh,

303
00:07:07.491 --> 00:07:09.530
and 1940.

304
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.610
Um,

305
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:11.211
and,

306
00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:11.300
uh,

307
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.670
the average tenure is about three years.

308
00:07:13.671 --> 00:07:13.941
But that,

309
00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:15.380
but that's not really not a,

310
00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:16.650
it's not a month,

311
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.573
not much,

312
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:18.201
but yet,

313
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:18.411
I mean,

314
00:07:18.411 --> 00:07:21.450
this is to exaggerate because the third republic does provide a,

315
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.200
uh,

316
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:22.330
uh,

317
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:22.561
you know,

318
00:07:22.561 --> 00:07:24.860
a stability for all of these great affairs.

319
00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:26.260
The Republic survives these,

320
00:07:26.261 --> 00:07:28.100
these two big affairs.

321
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.560
The Republic raises enough money to pay off the indemnity,

322
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:32.010
uh,

323
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.670
to the newly formed German empire.

324
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:35.480
Um,

325
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.170
but it is,

326
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.250
people react as to what they're thinking and not necessarily,

327
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:40.970
uh,

328
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:41.090
uh,

329
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.940
the reality that people are looking,

330
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:44.810
uh,

331
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.170
who are looking at this a,

332
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.073
a deeper.

333
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.370
So that's the,

334
00:07:48.371 --> 00:07:51.110
the Moodle on j affair or the crisis,

335
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:51.561
uh,

336
00:07:51.561 --> 00:07:52.191
is more,

337
00:07:52.191 --> 00:07:53.720
let's call it the bull and a crisis.

338
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.940
And the Dreyfus affair is better,

339
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.230
is more significant.

340
00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:57.821
Uh,

341
00:07:57.821 --> 00:08:00.230
then the events which are,

342
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:01.050
um,

343
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:01.291
are,

344
00:08:01.291 --> 00:08:02.124
are interesting,

345
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:02.990
uh,

346
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.210
uh,

347
00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:04.280
in their own way.

348
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.001
Uh,

349
00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:05.541
and of course,

350
00:08:05.541 --> 00:08:06.321
the other background,

351
00:08:06.321 --> 00:08:07.520
as I said the other day,

352
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:08.630
or the other context is,

353
00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:11.780
is are these political crises of corruption,

354
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:12.591
uh,

355
00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:13.010
which,

356
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:13.161
you know,

357
00:08:13.161 --> 00:08:13.671
in our country,

358
00:08:13.671 --> 00:08:13.941
we should,

359
00:08:13.941 --> 00:08:15.590
we're all too familiar with as well.

360
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:16.310
Uh,

361
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.530
the Panama crisis and the sale of,

362
00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:18.921
of,

363
00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:19.430
um,

364
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.070
uh,

365
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.410
lesion on donor by,

366
00:08:21.411 --> 00:08:21.711
uh,

367
00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:22.544
the presence,

368
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.480
a son in law,

369
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.261
et Cetera,

370
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:25.010
et cetera.

371
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:29.750
But this kind of frustration then builds up an anti parliamentarian,

372
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:30.980
uh,

373
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:31.813
movement,

374
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.060
uh,

375
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:32.960
in France,

376
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:33.561
uh,

377
00:08:33.561 --> 00:08:38.561
and the temptation of trying to find a strong man who will right this wrong and

378
00:08:40.341 --> 00:08:42.770
who we'll reattach the right arm of France,

379
00:08:42.771 --> 00:08:45.050
Alsace and Lorraine to,

380
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:45.920
uh,

381
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.753
to France.

382
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:47.913
Um,

383
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.793
the general,

384
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.320
uh,

385
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.060
a CRT whom you've read about it as you would a fairy he wrote in 1885.

386
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.250
That's a general impression is that the republic is the end of its rope.

387
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.490
Next year we will have revolutionary excesses again,

388
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.380
and then a violent reaction.

389
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.120
What will come out of this?

390
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.120
Surely some sort of dictatorship.

391
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:06.571
Uh,

392
00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:07.400
the feeling,

393
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:07.830
uh,

394
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:08.340
that,

395
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:08.430
uh,

396
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.110
the government was powerless.

397
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:10.771
Now,

398
00:09:10.771 --> 00:09:11.730
a guy called the Paul,

399
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:12.000
uh,

400
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.540
the hoe and add a creates in May of 1882,

401
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.310
the league of the Patriots,

402
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:20.510
he called himself a simple bell ringer,

403
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:20.940
uh,

404
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:25.290
for this anti parliamentary ultra nationalistic a of movement.

405
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.590
And it quickly has 182,000 members,

406
00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:30.960
which is a phenomenal amount.

407
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:31.530
Uh,

408
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:31.950
and it,

409
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.270
there's great echoes of,

410
00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:33.531
of,

411
00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:35.130
of aggressive patriotism,

412
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:35.880
uh,

413
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.511
et Cetera,

414
00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:37.344
et cetera.

415
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.880
And with this began,

416
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:39.790
uh,

417
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:40.530
the,

418
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.650
the rapidly rising career of general,

419
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.410
uh,

420
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:44.610
uh,

421
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:45.150
Josh,

422
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:45.650
uh,

423
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:45.980
uh,

424
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.260
Boulogne Jay who was born in 1837,

425
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:51.360
this son of a farmer,

426
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:51.750
uh,

427
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:52.710
and a Welsh,

428
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:53.603
a mother,

429
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.360
uh,

430
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.050
he was,

431
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.850
he had fought in four campaigns.

432
00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.800
He was wounded six times.

433
00:09:59.190 --> 00:09:59.400
Uh,

434
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.330
he was lucky,

435
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:01.440
uh,

436
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.610
and that he wasn't killed.

437
00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.420
Um,

438
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.070
he was wounded at the,

439
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.720
during the Paris commune,

440
00:10:06.721 --> 00:10:09.300
but before the great reprisals took place.

441
00:10:09.301 --> 00:10:14.301
So he wasn't identified with the massacre of ordinary people.

442
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.780
I hit the campaign's,

443
00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:16.950
he'd fought in Africa,

444
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.420
he'd fought in Italy,

445
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.160
and he'd fought in,

446
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:20.521
uh,

447
00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:22.890
in Vietnam or what they called in those days.

448
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:23.310
Uh,

449
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.150
Indochina,

450
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:25.590
he was a brave,

451
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.000
heroic figure.

452
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:27.811
Uh,

453
00:10:27.811 --> 00:10:28.770
he cut a mean,

454
00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:29.790
uh,

455
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:30.481
look on a,

456
00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:31.001
on a or a,

457
00:10:31.001 --> 00:10:33.120
an image on a horse.

458
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.650
He was a good a horseman.

459
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.030
He wasn't very bright,

460
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:37.710
but that never,

461
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:38.110
uh,

462
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.520
uh,

463
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.120
heard him,

464
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:39.271
uh,

465
00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:40.104
at all.

466
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:40.830
Uh,

467
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:41.371
he,

468
00:10:41.371 --> 00:10:41.640
uh,

469
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.530
received one promotion after another.

470
00:10:43.531 --> 00:10:46.770
He's the head of a whole military division at the age of 48,

471
00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:48.120
which is extremely young.

472
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:49.110
Uh,

473
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.400
but he had lots of energy.

474
00:10:50.401 --> 00:10:51.001
But as I said,

475
00:10:51.001 --> 00:10:52.280
not many brains and no tape,

476
00:10:52.281 --> 00:10:53.880
particular talent for organization,

477
00:10:53.881 --> 00:10:58.881
but he fit the image of what many people in France who were fed up with

478
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:00.534
republic,

479
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:01.050
uh,

480
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.210
believed that they,

481
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.163
uh,

482
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:04.620
uh,

483
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:04.801
the,

484
00:11:04.801 --> 00:11:05.820
the France needed.

485
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.160
He was sent to the u s that is this place,

486
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:08.910
uh,

487
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.080
at Yorktown.

488
00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:10.590
I,

489
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.920
in order to represent France at the centennial of,

490
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:14.610
uh,

491
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.520
of essentially the,

492
00:11:15.521 --> 00:11:16.860
the British is surrender,

493
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.070
uh,

494
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:17.670
in,

495
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:17.880
uh,

496
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.713
the American,

497
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:19.350
uh,

498
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:20.870
revolution I,

499
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.540
and he costs a stir to by refusing to leave the ship,

500
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:25.010
uh,

501
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:30.010
on which he'd arrived in America until they took down the German flags that were

502
00:11:30.091 --> 00:11:32.640
also being flown at the same time.

503
00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:33.030
And it,

504
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.940
and it is precisely the eighties when the mass press is developing in,

505
00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:37.923
in France.

506
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.520
And so these are just fabulous grow teeth,

507
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.260
big headlines in the newspaper.

508
00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.100
So it becomes clear to the shoe shoe.

509
00:11:45.101 --> 00:11:48.420
He becomes kind of the darling of a press,

510
00:11:48.421 --> 00:11:49.650
which is dominated by,

511
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:53.560
has always in France by the right wing press because of,

512
00:11:53.561 --> 00:11:54.394
of a,

513
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.800
a big money was,

514
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.300
it was the case traditionally United States and other countries,

515
00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:58.660
uh,

516
00:11:58.660 --> 00:11:59.530
as well.

517
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:00.760
Um,

518
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.120
but he's on good terms with come on soul who was,

519
00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:04.330
you know,

520
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.460
the Republican par excellence,

521
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.160
both had graduated from the same high school,

522
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:09.994
or at least say,

523
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:10.330
uh,

524
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:10.541
in,

525
00:12:10.541 --> 00:12:12.740
not on the edge of,

526
00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:14.080
of Normandy.

527
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:14.720
Uh,

528
00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:14.951
I mean,

529
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:16.300
they had to have Brittany I,

530
00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:17.081
he shared,

531
00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:18.640
come on sows residual,

532
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.350
uh,

533
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:22.230
or at least the inherent anticlerical wisdom.

534
00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:22.850
Uh,

535
00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:27.610
and that's something he would temper later as he's going after a right wing

536
00:12:27.611 --> 00:12:28.211
support.

537
00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:31.270
He became the director of the infantry at the war office.

538
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.200
Um,

539
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:32.771
and,

540
00:12:32.771 --> 00:12:32.921
uh,

541
00:12:32.921 --> 00:12:35.470
his superiors noted that he had a taste for clumsy,

542
00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:36.870
intrigued I,

543
00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:41.410
and complained about the civilians or the [inaudible] as they were called the

544
00:12:41.411 --> 00:12:42.240
Peking.

545
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:42.670
Uh,

546
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:47.090
people to civilians and they were treated with contempt to buy,

547
00:12:47.091 --> 00:12:47.330
uh,

548
00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.400
but by the military.

549
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:48.911
And of course,

550
00:12:48.911 --> 00:12:51.010
the role of the French army really all the way through,

551
00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:51.391
you know,

552
00:12:51.391 --> 00:12:51.521
the,

553
00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:51.700
uh,

554
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:56.340
to the Algerian war has been this tension between the officer corps very,

555
00:12:56.341 --> 00:12:59.080
very right wing and the civilian population.

556
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.140
Thus the attempts to kill the gall himself.

557
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:03.160
Uh,

558
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:03.951
and the time of,

559
00:13:03.951 --> 00:13:04.990
of the Algerian,

560
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:05.770
uh,

561
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:05.951
uh,

562
00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:06.820
situation.

563
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.310
And so he,

564
00:13:09.311 --> 00:13:10.060
um,

565
00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:10.421
you know,

566
00:13:10.421 --> 00:13:12.820
as an operator and he was that,

567
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:13.391
uh,

568
00:13:13.391 --> 00:13:13.931
he,

569
00:13:13.931 --> 00:13:14.764
um,

570
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:19.150
he took every possible opportunity to be seen in front of his troops.

571
00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:19.960
Uh,

572
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:20.620
he,

573
00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:21.010
uh,

574
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.320
he welcomed recruits with military,

575
00:13:23.321 --> 00:13:23.710
uh,

576
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:23.950
uh,

577
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.030
music as well as with [inaudible].

578
00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:27.390
It was his idea to paint,

579
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.080
to paint all the century boxes,

580
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:30.063
red,

581
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:30.850
white,

582
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:31.810
and blue.

583
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.560
Uh,

584
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.220
and,

585
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:33.850
um,

586
00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:34.451
he,

587
00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:35.110
um,

588
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.561
uh,

589
00:13:35.561 --> 00:13:38.200
at one point I had been insulted by somebody,

590
00:13:38.201 --> 00:13:40.420
then chamber of Deputies and he fights a dual,

591
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:41.070
uh,

592
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.870
if people fought a duel is a lot then,

593
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:44.481
uh,

594
00:13:44.481 --> 00:13:45.071
and his,

595
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:45.491
his,

596
00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:46.120
uh,

597
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.020
adoring public for,

598
00:13:47.021 --> 00:13:48.430
gave him for the fact that it's gone.

599
00:13:48.431 --> 00:13:53.431
Actually it didn't go off and that nobody was hurt in 1886 during the strike of

600
00:13:55.421 --> 00:13:55.871
the cause.

601
00:13:55.871 --> 00:13:57.230
Vila uh,

602
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.440
he did a very clever thing.

603
00:13:59.690 --> 00:13:59.970
I,

604
00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:02.680
in one of those soundbites before there were sound bites,

605
00:14:02.681 --> 00:14:03.514
somebody said,

606
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.550
what do you think about the strike in the cause?

607
00:14:07.551 --> 00:14:09.680
Vila of the miners in the Cassville.

608
00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:11.230
And he replied,

609
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.880
at this very moment,

610
00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:18.450
French soldiers are sharing their relations with a striking workers.

611
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.110
It was perfect.

612
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.840
And so he gets the support,

613
00:14:22.841 --> 00:14:27.841
at least in the early days of many workers who could imagine a kind of

614
00:14:29.141 --> 00:14:34.141
Napoleonic figure who can at least talk a good game about caring of caring about

615
00:14:35.081 --> 00:14:35.860
them,

616
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.720
even though he really,

617
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:37.960
uh,

618
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.780
didn't it all on the 14th of July,

619
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.100
1886,

620
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:47.130
all eyes are on him and they start writing songs about him.

621
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.880
Our brave general boot on Jay who will bring back Alsace.

622
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:52.790
And Lauren,

623
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:53.241
uh,

624
00:14:53.241 --> 00:14:56.180
he is co called general victory.

625
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:56.810
Uh,

626
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.150
a fairly soon one of the lines goes,

627
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:01.070
look at him over there.

628
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.220
He's smiling at us as he passes us by.

629
00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.120
Uh,

630
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.520
he has just brought us back in El Sauce.

631
00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:10.580
Um,

632
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.620
and so the German situation,

633
00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:14.450
tensions with the German Empire,

634
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:15.430
uh,

635
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.690
Eh,

636
00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:15.950
uh,

637
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.990
increase his popularity,

638
00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.053
uh,

639
00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.420
Bismarck himself.

640
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:21.680
That is Otto von Bismarck,

641
00:15:21.681 --> 00:15:22.100
the,

642
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:22.700
uh,

643
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:22.941
uh,

644
00:15:22.941 --> 00:15:24.040
the Kg,

645
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.400
uh,

646
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.120
uh,

647
00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:25.280
uh,

648
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.680
chancellor a of the second hike,

649
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:28.040
uh,

650
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.390
was aware of him,

651
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:29.931
uh,

652
00:15:29.931 --> 00:15:30.800
and he,

653
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:31.431
uh,

654
00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:36.020
uses a boodle and Jay's popularity for his own internal benefit,

655
00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:36.860
uh,

656
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:37.460
in,

657
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.080
uh,

658
00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:38.381
in,

659
00:15:38.381 --> 00:15:41.010
in Germany saying when France has any reason to believe that,

660
00:15:41.011 --> 00:15:43.730
that she is stronger than we are on that day.

661
00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.370
I believe that war is certain.

662
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.370
And one of the few ways of,

663
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:54.440
of that the Reichstag had and trying to rein in the,

664
00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:54.760
uh,

665
00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.530
the Kaiser arguably was attempting to,

666
00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:58.221
to,

667
00:15:58.221 --> 00:15:58.700
uh,

668
00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.600
I have some control of our military budget.

669
00:16:00.601 --> 00:16:00.860
So,

670
00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:01.390
so,

671
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:01.720
uh,

672
00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.250
Biz Biz mark uses a him very,

673
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:04.880
uh,

674
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.601
effectively,

675
00:16:05.601 --> 00:16:07.610
and then there's a spy crisis,

676
00:16:07.611 --> 00:16:09.710
a this terribly uninteresting,

677
00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:10.490
uh,

678
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:11.130
and,

679
00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:11.670
um,

680
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:12.570
um,

681
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:13.280
uh,

682
00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.340
it helps a [inaudible].

683
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:17.420
So this begins to scare people.

684
00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.620
And as you would a gravy now,

685
00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.720
whose son was the one implicated in the sale of a Alaysia on donor that says

686
00:16:23.721 --> 00:16:24.860
that he's got to go,

687
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.060
but what do you do with them?

688
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:26.520
Uh,

689
00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.130
you can't really make him a martyr.

690
00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:28.580
Uh,

691
00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:29.870
if you make him a martyr,

692
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:30.231
uh,

693
00:16:30.231 --> 00:16:31.340
then it looks like,

694
00:16:31.341 --> 00:16:31.760
uh,

695
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.181
uh,

696
00:16:32.181 --> 00:16:32.841
he,

697
00:16:32.841 --> 00:16:33.470
um,

698
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.861
uh,

699
00:16:33.861 --> 00:16:34.340
you know,

700
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:34.761
who knows,

701
00:16:34.761 --> 00:16:36.920
maybe there'll be some sort of a Todd attempt.

702
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:37.910
Um,

703
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:38.300
he,

704
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.330
he is not allowed to run for office because he's still in the army,

705
00:16:41.331 --> 00:16:43.070
but he's as a write in candidate,

706
00:16:43.071 --> 00:16:45.940
he gets something that he gets 39,000 votes in,

707
00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:46.431
which is a,

708
00:16:46.431 --> 00:16:46.671
you know,

709
00:16:46.671 --> 00:16:48.320
a large amount.

710
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:49.370
And so,

711
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:49.491
uh,

712
00:16:49.491 --> 00:16:53.000
the government says let's get rid of them before the next July 14th before,

713
00:16:53.001 --> 00:16:54.350
so he can't ride his horse down.

714
00:16:54.351 --> 00:16:55.580
The Sean sleazy again.

715
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:56.271
Uh,

716
00:16:56.271 --> 00:16:59.370
and so they send him to decide to senator into Claremont,

717
00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:00.500
Claremont fit home,

718
00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:01.220
uh,

719
00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.510
in Ovadia.

720
00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:03.021
Uh,

721
00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:05.960
and he's supposed to leave from the Godell y'all on the train,

722
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:06.710
uh,

723
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:07.790
on the 8th of July.

724
00:17:07.791 --> 00:17:12.791
And huge crowds start singing to the lycee that has seized power and they block

725
00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:14.990
the tracks is the first case that I know of,

726
00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:15.710
uh,

727
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:19.130
of people actually physically blocking railroad tracks as a,

728
00:17:19.131 --> 00:17:20.000
as a sign of,

729
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.661
of,

730
00:17:20.661 --> 00:17:21.260
um,

731
00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:21.890
uh,

732
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:21.981
uh,

733
00:17:21.981 --> 00:17:23.030
political protests.

734
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:24.380
And they're singing in Moussa.

735
00:17:24.381 --> 00:17:25.214
Yes.

736
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:25.431
Uh,

737
00:17:25.431 --> 00:17:26.061
also,

738
00:17:26.061 --> 00:17:26.601
which is,

739
00:17:26.601 --> 00:17:26.960
you know,

740
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.670
one thing is the song of the French revolution,

741
00:17:28.671 --> 00:17:29.480
but they're there,

742
00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.340
you have this sort of mixed because you've got this old server Jacabao uh,

743
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.810
we'll take what we want attitude,

744
00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:36.300
uh,

745
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:36.710
uh,

746
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:39.290
mixing with this sort of anti Republican,

747
00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:39.501
right.

748
00:17:39.501 --> 00:17:43.550
And Munos j seems like somebody who could please everybody in the early days he

749
00:17:43.551 --> 00:17:45.920
gets when he was soon be a real candidate.

750
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.680
He gets votes from the left while he's getting money.

751
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.620
Lots of it from the far right.

752
00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:57.180
And among all from monarchists who somehow see him as a way of bringing back

753
00:17:57.181 --> 00:17:57.281
the,

754
00:17:57.281 --> 00:17:57.670
the,

755
00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:58.351
the monarchy.

756
00:17:58.351 --> 00:17:59.520
There's this very wealthy,

757
00:17:59.521 --> 00:18:04.080
a monarchist Dutches from originally the family from [inaudible] and the gap,

758
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:04.860
uh,

759
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:05.250
in,

760
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:05.431
uh,

761
00:18:05.431 --> 00:18:05.641
you know,

762
00:18:05.641 --> 00:18:07.350
the south of France and,

763
00:18:07.351 --> 00:18:07.800
uh,

764
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:12.420
and she gives him lots of big bucks and Clayman.

765
00:18:12.421 --> 00:18:16.440
So dumps him as a friend saying that General Boulogne Jay's popularity has come

766
00:18:16.441 --> 00:18:19.260
too soon for one who likes noise.

767
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.900
So very much.

768
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:22.590
Um,

769
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:23.341
and then this,

770
00:18:23.341 --> 00:18:23.640
this,

771
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.451
this incident,

772
00:18:24.451 --> 00:18:26.370
they keep referring to this crisis,

773
00:18:26.371 --> 00:18:27.210
the scandal of,

774
00:18:27.211 --> 00:18:28.044
of gravy.

775
00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.750
A son in law begins to,

776
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:31.690
um,

777
00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:31.951
uh,

778
00:18:31.951 --> 00:18:33.870
a big begins to come along.

779
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.560
Uh,

780
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.490
and there are demonstrations against the republics,

781
00:18:38.491 --> 00:18:39.930
very existence.

782
00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:40.620
Uh,

783
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.161
the republic,

784
00:18:41.161 --> 00:18:41.521
again,

785
00:18:41.521 --> 00:18:42.840
that cannot take back Alsace.

786
00:18:42.841 --> 00:18:43.381
So ran,

787
00:18:43.381 --> 00:18:45.450
and it seems as rampant by this sort of,

788
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:46.583
uh,

789
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.370
a pool party,

790
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:48.630
this sort of corruption,

791
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.370
corrupt politics,

792
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:51.090
uh,

793
00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.220
here and there.

794
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:54.150
Um,

795
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.781
and,

796
00:18:54.781 --> 00:18:55.350
um,

797
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.650
uh,

798
00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.420
who comes along to be president of France,

799
00:18:57.421 --> 00:18:58.081
but study come,

800
00:18:58.081 --> 00:18:58.401
no,

801
00:18:58.401 --> 00:19:00.390
the same one who was going to be assassinated,

802
00:19:00.391 --> 00:19:00.900
uh,

803
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:01.141
uh,

804
00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:01.710
in,

805
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:01.861
uh,

806
00:19:01.861 --> 00:19:02.970
1894,

807
00:19:02.971 --> 00:19:03.990
as you've already heard.

808
00:19:03.991 --> 00:19:04.131
And,

809
00:19:04.131 --> 00:19:05.220
and when he's elected,

810
00:19:05.221 --> 00:19:06.570
there was a famous line went around,

811
00:19:06.571 --> 00:19:08.250
somebody said of the deputy,

812
00:19:08.251 --> 00:19:08.461
you know,

813
00:19:08.461 --> 00:19:10.080
the presidents elected by the deputies,

814
00:19:10.081 --> 00:19:11.280
not by the French population.

815
00:19:11.281 --> 00:19:11.781
And someone says,

816
00:19:11.781 --> 00:19:11.861
oh,

817
00:19:11.861 --> 00:19:12.181
come on.

818
00:19:12.181 --> 00:19:12.870
So,

819
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:13.440
um,

820
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.840
who should we vote for you,

821
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.680
asha,

822
00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:15.951
you know,

823
00:19:15.951 --> 00:19:16.770
who should we vote for me?

824
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:17.011
He says,

825
00:19:17.011 --> 00:19:19.260
vote for the stupidest volfer study,

826
00:19:19.261 --> 00:19:20.094
Camo,

827
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.230
and arguably study Commonweal was the stupidest.

828
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:22.711
Uh,

829
00:19:22.711 --> 00:19:24.000
and so he,

830
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:24.721
uh,

831
00:19:24.721 --> 00:19:27.240
he becomes a president of,

832
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:27.961
of,

833
00:19:27.961 --> 00:19:28.320
of,

834
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.910
of France OLED.

835
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.050
Any further comments?

836
00:19:31.051 --> 00:19:31.884
Go?

837
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:32.490
Anyway,

838
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:33.510
the contrast,

839
00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:34.260
uh,

840
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:34.591
uh,

841
00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:37.470
between a boot on Jay and between,

842
00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.493
uh,

843
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:44.090
and this sort of impotent a republic become a more and more marked.

844
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:50.990
Now I'm one thing leads to another and a chips are wine tells a story,

845
00:19:51.721 --> 00:19:56.721
but it comes down to the fact that he's sitting in a restaurant in Paris,

846
00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:58.500
uh,

847
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.630
in 1889.

848
00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:04.620
He's now no longer a ineligible to be a candidate,

849
00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:09.420
and he's elected to the Chamber of Deputies and he's dining in a restaurant near

850
00:20:09.421 --> 00:20:11.130
the Church of the Madeleine.

851
00:20:11.131 --> 00:20:13.880
When could imagine it being Maxine's favorite,

852
00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:14.590
uh,

853
00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:16.650
a famous restaurant there.

854
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:17.191
Uh,

855
00:20:17.191 --> 00:20:20.070
and there's a crowds of people in the streets.

856
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.760
And this particular restaurant is not far from the Chamber of Deputies,

857
00:20:23.761 --> 00:20:24.900
is right across the river,

858
00:20:24.901 --> 00:20:28.170
basically from the Chamber of Deputies.

859
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.250
Um,

860
00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:30.360
and he,

861
00:20:30.361 --> 00:20:30.960
um,

862
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.660
he hears the crowd shouting for him to take action,

863
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.710
uh,

864
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:37.890
to go out and greet his adores.

865
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:39.690
And then who knows,

866
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.550
as the rightest would try to do.

867
00:20:41.551 --> 00:20:43.890
And on February 6th,

868
00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:48.890
1934 to row across the river and to end this impotent republic,

869
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.080
but he just sits there and he sits there on four on false,

870
00:20:53.081 --> 00:20:53.914
on Walsh called ma'am.

871
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.030
And he sits there and he finishes his elaborate meal.

872
00:20:58.540 --> 00:20:59.380
I would have been there,

873
00:20:59.381 --> 00:21:00.160
not with him,

874
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.150
I wouldn't have died with him,

875
00:21:01.151 --> 00:21:03.730
but I would have finished every plate myself,

876
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:04.391
uh,

877
00:21:04.391 --> 00:21:06.010
in every glass of wine as well.

878
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.470
And then he goes upstairs with his mistress,

879
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.540
a to a nearby hotel.

880
00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.410
And the opportunity I is,

881
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:15.221
is,

882
00:21:15.221 --> 00:21:15.431
uh,

883
00:21:15.431 --> 00:21:16.330
is past.

884
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.920
And while he hesitates,

885
00:21:17.921 --> 00:21:18.551
so someone wants,

886
00:21:18.551 --> 00:21:19.750
wrote his enemies,

887
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:20.050
uh,

888
00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:20.883
do not,

889
00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:26.010
they eliminate the electoral a procedure that it allowed him to be,

890
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.920
uh,

891
00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:27.220
uh,

892
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.180
to be elected.

893
00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.050
Um,

894
00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:31.660
he is worried that they're going to arrest him.

895
00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.190
And so he goes off to brew,

896
00:21:33.191 --> 00:21:33.581
sell.

897
00:21:33.581 --> 00:21:34.370
He goes off to,

898
00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:34.820
uh,

899
00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:35.080
uh,

900
00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:39.190
to Belgium and this makes them seem a little less dashing and a little less

901
00:21:39.191 --> 00:21:43.120
brave as he scurries across the frontier.

902
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.230
Um,

903
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:45.700
and um,

904
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.340
there's a committee working for him.

905
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.510
I in France,

906
00:21:49.511 --> 00:21:50.860
but he stays there.

907
00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:51.963
And in the end,

908
00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.130
what he does is,

909
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:54.760
um,

910
00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.820
he was very devoted to his ministers for all these years.

911
00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:58.391
I,

912
00:21:58.391 --> 00:22:02.920
and she becomes ill in 1891 and she dies after a long,

913
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.790
horrible illness and we don't,

914
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.371
Jay knows,

915
00:22:06.371 --> 00:22:07.900
couple hours in Anahata,

916
00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:08.890
uh,

917
00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.140
on the 30th of September,

918
00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:11.141
1891,

919
00:22:11.141 --> 00:22:13.930
he went alone to her grave and blew his brains out.

920
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:17.170
And that was the end of boot on Jay the republic,

921
00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:20.710
or merged a strengthened by this crisis.

922
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:23.710
But that's only one thing that's important about it.

923
00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:29.440
What's more important about it is what was happening to the right in this

924
00:22:29.441 --> 00:22:30.430
context.

925
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.900
And what does this have to tell us about mass politics?

926
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:38.710
What it has to tell us is that it's the mass politics.

927
00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:39.250
Uh,

928
00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:43.540
I've that Moodle and Jay and this crisis is one of the great examples of this

929
00:22:43.541 --> 00:22:45.250
new political world,

930
00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:45.641
uh,

931
00:22:45.641 --> 00:22:48.040
that you could find.

932
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:48.940
Uh,

933
00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.930
I had one of my TA's years ago whose dissertation I directed,

934
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:53.803
uh,

935
00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:54.683
uh,

936
00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:55.520
it's a passive,

937
00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:55.770
he,

938
00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:56.100
Latanya,

939
00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:56.321
long,

940
00:22:56.321 --> 00:22:57.154
long time ago,

941
00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:57.611
uh,

942
00:22:57.611 --> 00:22:58.750
he went offers thesis,

943
00:22:58.751 --> 00:23:00.220
which became a very interesting book.

944
00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:03.640
And I was interested in this very a question.

945
00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.230
And so I draw on,

946
00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:05.480
on,

947
00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.520
on some of of his findings that I just discussed with him.

948
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.110
Uh,

949
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.300
uh,

950
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.560
very often,

951
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:12.911
uh,

952
00:23:12.911 --> 00:23:13.331
what he did,

953
00:23:13.331 --> 00:23:13.860
incidentally,

954
00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.420
this is what one does with some dissertations.

955
00:23:16.421 --> 00:23:20.110
He went off and he looked at four different parts of France and one was the

956
00:23:20.111 --> 00:23:20.650
mile.

957
00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:25.480
That is the departments of the last one was the easier it would just go nobles

958
00:23:25.481 --> 00:23:26.021
department.

959
00:23:26.021 --> 00:23:28.570
One is the jazz famous for his flog raw,

960
00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:29.131
uh,

961
00:23:29.131 --> 00:23:31.300
and as Armagnac to at least in part.

962
00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:31.990
Uh,

963
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.740
and uh,

964
00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.770
the other was the on that which is a Norman Department,

965
00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:36.021
uh,

966
00:23:36.021 --> 00:23:36.761
in the west,

967
00:23:36.761 --> 00:23:38.410
the capital of which is out on song.

968
00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:43.980
And what he was more interested in is how the message got out to very ordinary

969
00:23:45.801 --> 00:23:47.660
people living in those places.

970
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:51.410
How do they know about boot on j and what,

971
00:23:51.411 --> 00:23:53.270
and this is part of mass politics.

972
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:58.510
One of the ways that people for centuries had learned how to read or not if they

973
00:23:58.701 --> 00:23:59.990
didn't even know how to read,

974
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:01.003
but how to,

975
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:06.130
to imagine a religious and political and military events was in reading.

976
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:10.940
Uh,

977
00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:11.810
the equivalent,

978
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.540
and I'm not dissing them by calling them comic strips,

979
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:18.680
but their format was rather like that they were called the Imago Dei p novel.

980
00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:23.820
There are images that were cranked out that were produced in the town of AP Nol

981
00:24:24.201 --> 00:24:28.280
in the east of France in the voltage that would describe,

982
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.000
uh,

983
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.290
or show you pictures of,

984
00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.370
of saints.

985
00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.710
I would show you pictures of generals.

986
00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.480
It would show you Napoleon,

987
00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.060
it would show you all sorts of things.

988
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.600
And these are peddled to villages,

989
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:42.200
uh,

990
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.520
by these [inaudible].

991
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:48.380
They're called in French by these peddlers who carry these huge leather sacks

992
00:24:48.381 --> 00:24:50.000
that looked like medicine balls.

993
00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.370
But there were about three times bigger than that.

994
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:53.061
And when the,

995
00:24:53.061 --> 00:24:54.510
in a lot of them were from the [inaudible],

996
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.270
from the area of to lose,

997
00:24:56.271 --> 00:24:58.190
a lot of them are from the [inaudible] that is in the,

998
00:24:58.191 --> 00:24:59.630
in the mountains of,

999
00:24:59.631 --> 00:25:01.070
of the massive songs hall.

1000
00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:06.340
And a lot of them above all were from the mountains of the Alps near Grenoble.

1001
00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:10.190
And these people had their whole credit networks established where they could

1002
00:25:10.191 --> 00:25:13.160
get credit to get to their next stops all the way through.

1003
00:25:13.161 --> 00:25:15.980
France is a tremendously interesting phenomenon.

1004
00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:18.350
And they followed this same routes year after year.

1005
00:25:18.351 --> 00:25:19.220
They were known,

1006
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:20.241
anticipated.

1007
00:25:20.241 --> 00:25:21.620
They sold pins,

1008
00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:22.131
a,

1009
00:25:22.131 --> 00:25:23.960
they sold pens,

1010
00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:26.600
they sold images of the Virgin Mary.

1011
00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:27.790
They showed images of,

1012
00:25:27.791 --> 00:25:28.960
of sold images of,

1013
00:25:28.961 --> 00:25:32.600
of Sasa Bassiana though you wouldn't get away with selling that in parts of

1014
00:25:32.601 --> 00:25:33.434
France.

1015
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.890
Uh,

1016
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:34.940
they sold cups,

1017
00:25:34.941 --> 00:25:36.770
anything that they could carry and they could sell.

1018
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.680
And they sold these images of,

1019
00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:40.371
of,

1020
00:25:40.371 --> 00:25:40.970
uh,

1021
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:43.190
of the became a political life.

1022
00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:48.640
And so butoh and Jay is plugged into this or popular library,

1023
00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:50.360
if you will,

1024
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:53.090
at a time when most people could now read,

1025
00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:53.720
uh,

1026
00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:58.720
the kinds of pamphlets and images of him arrive with these peddlers carrying

1027
00:25:59.931 --> 00:26:01.340
this stuff on their backs.

1028
00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:02.720
These are hardy people.

1029
00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:03.530
Um,

1030
00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:06.650
and now arriving also by train.

1031
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:07.420
Uh,

1032
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:11.750
and so this stuff is a riving in shuttle on Sham Banya or wherever,

1033
00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:12.141
you know,

1034
00:26:12.141 --> 00:26:16.160
this stuff gets dumped off at the dock and then it's the goes to this next stop,

1035
00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:16.970
uh,

1036
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:21.110
on horse drawn wagons or on the backs of these people.

1037
00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:22.760
And so what,

1038
00:26:22.761 --> 00:26:23.041
what,

1039
00:26:23.041 --> 00:26:24.500
what burns found was,

1040
00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:25.220
was that,

1041
00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:25.730
uh,

1042
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:27.830
in all of these day Patho mom,

1043
00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:28.880
uh,

1044
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.510
that these images just inundate the place.

1045
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:34.250
And this is modern political life.

1046
00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:35.301
This is this,

1047
00:26:35.301 --> 00:26:39.260
this is a really the emergence of modern political life.

1048
00:26:39.261 --> 00:26:42.560
So there are two things really interesting about Moodle and j in the end,

1049
00:26:42.561 --> 00:26:43.570
besides the Republica,

1050
00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:44.011
you know,

1051
00:26:44.011 --> 00:26:44.844
survives.

1052
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:45.270
Ah,

1053
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:45.660
you know,

1054
00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:49.830
the first really is that is I'll make this case hope clear,

1055
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.270
hopefully clear in a minute.

1056
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:53.220
It's the origins maybe of the modern,

1057
00:26:53.221 --> 00:26:53.581
right,

1058
00:26:53.581 --> 00:26:57.150
but it's also part of this or mass politics,

1059
00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:57.840
uh,

1060
00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:58.440
that,

1061
00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.130
uh,

1062
00:26:59.130 --> 00:26:59.701
uh,

1063
00:26:59.701 --> 00:27:00.630
that that happens.

1064
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:02.100
And these are very rural,

1065
00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:02.690
uh,

1066
00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:02.850
uh,

1067
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:03.790
date pop them all,

1068
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.410
uh,

1069
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:05.550
the [inaudible] again,

1070
00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:06.151
I'm sorry,

1071
00:27:06.151 --> 00:27:07.800
g e r s Zygiast,

1072
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:09.000
the capital of which is oce,

1073
00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:10.590
which is wonderful cathedral,

1074
00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:11.520
uh,

1075
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.271
uh,

1076
00:27:12.271 --> 00:27:14.670
is 83% rural at the time.

1077
00:27:14.671 --> 00:27:15.540
We're talking about.

1078
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.351
Uh,

1079
00:27:16.351 --> 00:27:21.351
so these paddlers are going around to farm houses or people are coming to the

1080
00:27:21.751 --> 00:27:26.430
market and they're hearing the serves speakers along with the charlatans and,

1081
00:27:26.431 --> 00:27:27.120
and uh,

1082
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.220
and jugglers a on a market day.

1083
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.890
They're hearing people talk about no club ravage and Ah,

1084
00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:33.130
you know,

1085
00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:38.130
our brave general of Boulogne Jay and talking about how they hate Jews.

1086
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:41.310
And so this merges with,

1087
00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:41.850
uh,

1088
00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:46.170
the antisemitism or markable thing about this department of the mom.

1089
00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:46.620
Uh,

1090
00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:46.861
now,

1091
00:27:46.861 --> 00:27:47.581
as I've said before,

1092
00:27:47.581 --> 00:27:47.860
I mean,

1093
00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.350
that's why I asked in the shot at all.

1094
00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:53.190
And now all those graves,

1095
00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.380
all those graves is that,

1096
00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:56.040
uh,

1097
00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:00.030
the antisemitic propaganda has a tremendous impact in the department of the

1098
00:28:00.031 --> 00:28:00.690
Marne,

1099
00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:04.860
which supports Moodle on Jay and the people who support,

1100
00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:05.120
I mean,

1101
00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:05.281
who,

1102
00:28:05.281 --> 00:28:05.490
who,

1103
00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:06.660
who follow him.

1104
00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.950
And there were no Jews in the department of the mile.

1105
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:12.533
So what,

1106
00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:17.690
what happens is the antisemites and this mass politics constructs the other,

1107
00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:24.860
the imagine other that literally it is not who did literally does not exist in

1108
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:26.700
the Department of the Marne.

1109
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:27.750
So it,

1110
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:32.040
but it lodges in with the French would call the imaginary in,

1111
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.641
in,

1112
00:28:32.641 --> 00:28:32.851
you know,

1113
00:28:32.851 --> 00:28:36.870
in the mental universe of mental world of ordinary people,

1114
00:28:36.871 --> 00:28:38.310
not all of them to be sure,

1115
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:39.720
but it is this,

1116
00:28:39.721 --> 00:28:44.570
this sort of a on slot of images of boot on j uh,

1117
00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.850
that become part of this enormous,

1118
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:48.510
uh,

1119
00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:51.780
propaganda campaign in France.

1120
00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:53.190
Uh,

1121
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:58.190
they would print out balance and so political lists would already be printed out

1122
00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:00.930
and you pick your list.

1123
00:29:00.931 --> 00:29:01.111
I mean,

1124
00:29:01.111 --> 00:29:01.681
it's still a case.

1125
00:29:01.681 --> 00:29:03.060
I'm in this pool elections today,

1126
00:29:03.061 --> 00:29:04.030
at least where we are,

1127
00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:04.561
where we live,

1128
00:29:04.561 --> 00:29:05.940
it must be everywhere.

1129
00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:10.770
And how many millions of the ballots are printed there in 1889,

1130
00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.360
they would don't j posters,

1131
00:29:12.361 --> 00:29:15.060
5 million posters.

1132
00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:15.391
I mean,

1133
00:29:15.391 --> 00:29:16.410
that's a phenomenal amount.

1134
00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:21.560
7 million ballots and talking about mass politics photos,

1135
00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:26.910
they're no longer just dependent upon images that some clever person with,

1136
00:29:26.911 --> 00:29:27.240
with,

1137
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:27.840
uh,

1138
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.141
uh,

1139
00:29:28.141 --> 00:29:30.510
with crayons and pens have sketched.

1140
00:29:30.511 --> 00:29:31.920
It become these images of AP.

1141
00:29:31.921 --> 00:29:36.921
Now there are real photos of the guy on his horse.

1142
00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.580
And,

1143
00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.160
uh,

1144
00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:39.410
you,

1145
00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:39.960
you had to,

1146
00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.610
before you had to imagine Napoleon,

1147
00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:41.730
the,

1148
00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:42.220
like,

1149
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.440
you had to imagine what the king look like,

1150
00:29:44.441 --> 00:29:44.651
or they'll,

1151
00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:46.660
Louie the 16th is identified with somebody who wants,

1152
00:29:46.661 --> 00:29:47.710
saw him from a distance.

1153
00:29:47.711 --> 00:29:49.240
When he tries to escape the Vrn,

1154
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:53.170
somebody actually seen him and somebody else knew it was him because his nose

1155
00:29:53.171 --> 00:29:53.970
look the same as,

1156
00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:54.460
as,

1157
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:55.550
as his face on a,

1158
00:29:55.551 --> 00:29:55.961
on a,

1159
00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:56.794
on a coin.

1160
00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:57.550
Uh,

1161
00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:58.870
but you didn't see people.

1162
00:29:58.871 --> 00:29:59.710
But here you could see,

1163
00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:00.380
you could see,

1164
00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.150
and Jay,

1165
00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:02.470
you could imagine when he looked like,

1166
00:30:02.471 --> 00:30:03.280
and even if you,

1167
00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.113
if you lived in the,

1168
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:04.780
you know,

1169
00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:05.231
uh,

1170
00:30:05.231 --> 00:30:05.771
and the boss,

1171
00:30:05.771 --> 00:30:06.090
uh,

1172
00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:06.550
and,

1173
00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:07.300
and then the,

1174
00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:07.851
in appearance,

1175
00:30:07.851 --> 00:30:08.011
he,

1176
00:30:08.011 --> 00:30:09.280
and we live in the [inaudible] or the Ba,

1177
00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:10.120
a bus peer.

1178
00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:13.120
He ne you could imagine what else sauce look like.

1179
00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:13.840
Uh,

1180
00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.630
and it feeds into this kind of frenzy of,

1181
00:30:16.631 --> 00:30:16.931
of,

1182
00:30:16.931 --> 00:30:17.260
uh,

1183
00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:18.570
publications about Alsace.

1184
00:30:18.571 --> 00:30:18.970
Lorraine,

1185
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:20.230
the most famous is called the,

1186
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:23.860
the tour to false Bob [inaudible] phone.

1187
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:24.600
Uh,

1188
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.150
um,

1189
00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:26.040
and which to,

1190
00:30:26.041 --> 00:30:26.410
um,

1191
00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:31.360
the brothers promise a their father on his deathbed that they will see France.

1192
00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:33.850
And there was the biggest selling book outside of the Bible in,

1193
00:30:33.851 --> 00:30:34.051
in,

1194
00:30:34.051 --> 00:30:34.900
in 19th century,

1195
00:30:34.901 --> 00:30:35.670
France.

1196
00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:35.951
Uh,

1197
00:30:35.951 --> 00:30:40.360
and they go around and in this very banal boring book and they see people all

1198
00:30:40.361 --> 00:30:41.500
wearing different costumes,

1199
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.440
eating different things and doing different work,

1200
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:46.420
but their hearts all pounding the same way.

1201
00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:51.250
And they're practically in tears on the state of collapse when they imagine

1202
00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:52.540
Alsace Loran and these,

1203
00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:54.480
these l station young women dress,

1204
00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:55.000
dress,

1205
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.590
an Alsatian costumes and,

1206
00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:57.551
and thinking of the,

1207
00:30:57.551 --> 00:31:01.080
about a sauce and having to put up with the late Bush with,

1208
00:31:01.081 --> 00:31:02.350
with the Germans and all this stuff.

1209
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:03.180
So,

1210
00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:03.580
uh,

1211
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:04.690
but it,

1212
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:05.290
so these,

1213
00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:06.430
the numbers are,

1214
00:31:06.431 --> 00:31:11.320
they just flood the countryside and these songs that people could sing in music

1215
00:31:11.321 --> 00:31:13.360
halls and a lot of the music calls in Paris,

1216
00:31:13.361 --> 00:31:14.610
there might've been a lot of minimal Moscow.

1217
00:31:14.611 --> 00:31:16.090
There was thinking anarchist songs,

1218
00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:16.541
uh,

1219
00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:17.530
in the 1890s,

1220
00:31:17.531 --> 00:31:22.450
but a lot of the other music halls are singing about general bu lone Jay and

1221
00:31:22.451 --> 00:31:23.350
songs like,

1222
00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:23.920
you know,

1223
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:24.310
uh,

1224
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:28.990
the big sweep that is with a broom sweeping away the corruption of these,

1225
00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.670
of these deputies,

1226
00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:32.590
of the Sean was a deputy.

1227
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:36.850
And putting in your kind of big heroic guy.

1228
00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.500
And what about busts?

1229
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:39.850
If you think about busts,

1230
00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:40.480
uh,

1231
00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.050
that is,

1232
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:41.100
uh,

1233
00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:41.321
you know,

1234
00:31:41.321 --> 00:31:42.640
sculptured busts,

1235
00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:43.420
uh,

1236
00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.900
that this is the time when the image of the Republic,

1237
00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:47.111
my yon is,

1238
00:31:47.111 --> 00:31:47.771
I've said before,

1239
00:31:47.771 --> 00:31:49.930
is elbowing the Virgin Mary out of the way.

1240
00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:50.680
Uh,

1241
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:55.120
and there's this sort of battle over space in classroom while on classroom walls

1242
00:31:55.121 --> 00:31:57.670
and in the streets of cities and villages and,

1243
00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:58.660
and all of that.

1244
00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:01.690
The mission crosses are being broken off in the middle of the night by their

1245
00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:02.970
enemies and said,

1246
00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:03.570
et Cetera,

1247
00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:04.403
et cetera.

1248
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:05.480
And uh,

1249
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.360
Merissa who no one was a great historian.

1250
00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:08.200
Uh,

1251
00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.670
one of the books that he did,

1252
00:32:09.671 --> 00:32:10.151
one of the many,

1253
00:32:10.151 --> 00:32:10.391
many,

1254
00:32:10.391 --> 00:32:14.020
many books that he did was on the images of the Republic in,

1255
00:32:14.021 --> 00:32:14.501
in,

1256
00:32:14.501 --> 00:32:15.040
uh,

1257
00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:15.730
uh,

1258
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:17.560
in town halls.

1259
00:32:17.561 --> 00:32:17.780
You know,

1260
00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:18.251
in the Ma,

1261
00:32:18.251 --> 00:32:19.870
he where people get married and,

1262
00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:20.440
and,

1263
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:20.851
and the,

1264
00:32:20.851 --> 00:32:23.620
the kinds of statutes that they put up in the third republic,

1265
00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:28.780
it comparable to the kind of work being done at warm memorials after a World War

1266
00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:29.460
One.

1267
00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:29.680
And,

1268
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:34.680
and so Bruno Oj fits right into that because there's 100,000 bus of,

1269
00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:35.771
uh,

1270
00:32:35.771 --> 00:32:36.740
of brutal and Shea,

1271
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:37.843
and you can,

1272
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:38.380
uh,

1273
00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:39.560
you don't have to one,

1274
00:32:39.561 --> 00:32:41.510
they will give one to you to put it up.

1275
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.260
Uh,

1276
00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:42.760
you know,

1277
00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:43.250
uh,

1278
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:45.650
where you want and your dresser or whatever.

1279
00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:48.230
And so this is really mass politics.

1280
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:48.771
Uh,

1281
00:32:48.771 --> 00:32:49.341
and,

1282
00:32:49.341 --> 00:32:49.880
uh,

1283
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.391
uh,

1284
00:32:50.391 --> 00:32:51.740
he erodes,

1285
00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:52.623
um,

1286
00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:53.121
uh,

1287
00:32:53.121 --> 00:32:57.020
if he roads Republican support in some places he doesn't do well everywhere.

1288
00:32:57.370 --> 00:32:59.540
The republic is really stronger than its opponents.

1289
00:32:59.541 --> 00:33:03.140
That that's obviously one of the points in one of the departments that I

1290
00:33:03.141 --> 00:33:03.690
mentioned,

1291
00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:05.640
it doesn't matter which one it was the jails,

1292
00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:06.260
but he,

1293
00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:06.651
he,

1294
00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:07.130
uh,

1295
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:07.370
uh,

1296
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:10.610
builds upon strong support for a bona partism,

1297
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:11.121
uh,

1298
00:33:11.121 --> 00:33:13.490
in that part of,

1299
00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:13.921
of,

1300
00:33:13.921 --> 00:33:14.754
of France.

1301
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:15.111
Uh,

1302
00:33:15.111 --> 00:33:15.681
and of course,

1303
00:33:15.681 --> 00:33:18.740
one thing that he does is that he is able to,

1304
00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:19.813
uh,

1305
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:22.100
he plays off beautifully,

1306
00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:22.700
uh,

1307
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.390
with,

1308
00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:23.930
uh,

1309
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:24.131
the,

1310
00:33:24.131 --> 00:33:25.280
the antisemites,

1311
00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:25.731
uh,

1312
00:33:25.731 --> 00:33:27.190
and their newspapers.

1313
00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:27.760
Uh,

1314
00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:31.370
a double mall is a newspaper called the Libra pothole.

1315
00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:32.500
Uh,

1316
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:32.871
the,

1317
00:33:32.871 --> 00:33:33.704
the,

1318
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:34.930
the free word or the,

1319
00:33:34.931 --> 00:33:35.201
the,

1320
00:33:35.201 --> 00:33:36.320
the open word or,

1321
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:36.950
uh,

1322
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:37.670
uh,

1323
00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:38.503
uh,

1324
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:39.200
is,

1325
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:39.650
uh,

1326
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:39.861
you know,

1327
00:33:39.861 --> 00:33:41.630
is sort of the classic of your land,

1328
00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:44.820
Right Wing newspaper and Charlotte Masa,

1329
00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:45.320
uh,

1330
00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.380
who was a monarchist and who it was a,

1331
00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:48.410
it was a subtle,

1332
00:33:48.411 --> 00:33:50.660
but he was a really great writer.

1333
00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.040
Mohas was just,

1334
00:33:52.041 --> 00:33:52.250
you know,

1335
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:53.360
fantastic writer.

1336
00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:54.170
Uh,

1337
00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:55.810
he also is just a,

1338
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:58.330
just vehemently antisemetic though it in,

1339
00:33:58.460 --> 00:33:59.270
in a lesson.

1340
00:33:59.270 --> 00:33:59.481
Well,

1341
00:33:59.481 --> 00:33:59.830
I mean,

1342
00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:00.920
antisemitism is,

1343
00:34:00.921 --> 00:34:01.850
Volvo are totally,

1344
00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:02.300
but,

1345
00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:02.971
but he,

1346
00:34:02.971 --> 00:34:03.420
he,

1347
00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:06.330
you more restrained in his creative criticism and et Cetera,

1348
00:34:06.331 --> 00:34:06.740
et cetera.

1349
00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:07.251
But this is,

1350
00:34:07.251 --> 00:34:12.251
fits right into the image of boot on j andJ is willing to,

1351
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:13.401
uh,

1352
00:34:13.401 --> 00:34:14.600
to go along with this.

1353
00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:14.990
I mean,

1354
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.471
who knows,

1355
00:34:15.471 --> 00:34:16.790
I've used antisemitic or not,

1356
00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:17.390
uh,

1357
00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:21.170
probably because of the long traditions of antisemitism in the army.

1358
00:34:21.171 --> 00:34:22.280
More about this later,

1359
00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:23.030
uh,

1360
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.450
uh,

1361
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:24.600
one imagines that,

1362
00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:25.550
that he was,

1363
00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:27.260
but this is what's important about it.

1364
00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:27.831
That,

1365
00:34:27.831 --> 00:34:32.831
and the fact that the first time these people are in the right is in the streets

1366
00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:34.610
and they're tough.

1367
00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.660
They're tough guys.

1368
00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:35.931
And,

1369
00:34:35.931 --> 00:34:36.140
and,

1370
00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:40.250
and this anticipates the 1920s and the 1930s also,

1371
00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.180
uh,

1372
00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:43.040
that and Paris has changed too.

1373
00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:44.760
I'm going to do a whole lecture on Paris one day,

1374
00:34:44.761 --> 00:34:46.220
but Paris is no longer,

1375
00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:46.990
uh,

1376
00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:47.220
the,

1377
00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:48.560
the Paris of,

1378
00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:51.020
of radical Republican a song,

1379
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:56.030
Kudos of the artisans and the petty bourgeois who supported Maximilian

1380
00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:57.560
Robespierre in the French revolution.

1381
00:34:57.561 --> 00:35:00.200
That's no longer the Paris of 1848.

1382
00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.070
Uh,

1383
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:05.090
the geographic shifts and social structure of Paris have,

1384
00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.810
have transformed and enhanced forth until 1968.

1385
00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:10.790
The big demonstrations,

1386
00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:16.180
they go money for demonstrations are those of the right for the canonization of

1387
00:35:17.301 --> 00:35:18.260
Joan of arc after,

1388
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:19.460
after 1920,

1389
00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:20.480
uh,

1390
00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:20.730
uh,

1391
00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:23.240
against the Republican 1934.

1392
00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.100
So it's a different Paris.

1393
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:25.941
But is,

1394
00:35:25.941 --> 00:35:28.250
is as my friend William Irvine has argued,

1395
00:35:28.251 --> 00:35:29.270
he was one of the first to argue this.

1396
00:35:29.271 --> 00:35:30.860
I think it is a turning point,

1397
00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:31.340
uh,

1398
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:32.510
in the history of,

1399
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:34.250
of the right as well.

1400
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:39.430
Now to be sure you can't look through those wonderful glasses of hindsight.

1401
00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:45.530
And if you're trying to explain osh fits or you're trying to explain the arrest

1402
00:35:46.171 --> 00:35:47.004
of the Jews,

1403
00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.313
the Jewish children,

1404
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:50.490
and their parents and grandparents in Paris,

1405
00:35:50.491 --> 00:35:53.940
and 42 and 43 by the French,

1406
00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:55.000
you know,

1407
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:55.280
it's,

1408
00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:55.570
you,

1409
00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:57.540
it's a little much to go back and say,

1410
00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:58.670
you know,

1411
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:59.170
it's,

1412
00:35:59.170 --> 00:35:59.410
it's,

1413
00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:00.920
he'd be on to filter the boot on Jay.

1414
00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:01.591
You know,

1415
00:36:01.591 --> 00:36:04.470
but that's the kind of connection that it's [inaudible] fault that that's the

1416
00:36:04.471 --> 00:36:06.150
kind of a connection that,

1417
00:36:06.151 --> 00:36:07.970
that hindsight gives you that,

1418
00:36:07.971 --> 00:36:09.450
that you have to be a little careful with.

1419
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.160
But this stuff was out there.

1420
00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:12.323
Uh,

1421
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:12.901
it was out there,

1422
00:36:12.901 --> 00:36:13.830
much war in Germany,

1423
00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:14.130
uh,

1424
00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:15.450
that was in France.

1425
00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:16.350
Uh,

1426
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:19.770
but antisemitism was part of all of this.

1427
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.440
And it was part of the whole image of,

1428
00:36:22.441 --> 00:36:23.100
uh,

1429
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:23.491
uh,

1430
00:36:23.491 --> 00:36:24.540
of this man,

1431
00:36:24.541 --> 00:36:25.560
of this poor man who,

1432
00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:26.461
who,

1433
00:36:26.461 --> 00:36:27.150
uh,

1434
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:30.570
had had enough and blows his brains all over his,

1435
00:36:30.571 --> 00:36:31.020
uh,

1436
00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.120
his mistresses,

1437
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:33.130
mistress,

1438
00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:33.963
his grave.

1439
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:35.420
Now,

1440
00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:36.253
um,

1441
00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.690
that's a long way of getting to,

1442
00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:41.210
uh,

1443
00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.073
the Dreyfus,

1444
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:44.790
the Dreyfus affair.

1445
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:49.530
And I'll say less about that because the Dreyfus affair is more obvious than,

1446
00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:50.221
uh,

1447
00:36:50.221 --> 00:36:51.510
than the Google Nj affair.

1448
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:52.800
The Dreyfus affair,

1449
00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:53.580
uh,

1450
00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:57.060
reflects this anti Semitism that,

1451
00:36:57.061 --> 00:37:01.080
that to head bed accentuated by the economic crisis that begins in the mid,

1452
00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:02.010
uh,

1453
00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:02.191
uh,

1454
00:37:02.191 --> 00:37:07.191
1870s and 1873 and 1874 where it was easy to blame it on.

1455
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:07.861
The Jews,

1456
00:37:07.861 --> 00:37:11.840
blame it on the Jewish bankers blaming it on the Jewish department stores a,

1457
00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:13.020
blame it on somebody.

1458
00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:14.010
Um,

1459
00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:15.300
and um,

1460
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:20.480
but it fits a rather a nicely into all of that from the point of view of trying

1461
00:37:21.481 --> 00:37:21.830
to,

1462
00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:22.080
uh,

1463
00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:22.913
analyze,

1464
00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:23.640
uh,

1465
00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:24.270
um,

1466
00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:24.440
uh,

1467
00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.280
all of that now to them all.

1468
00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:26.731
Uh,

1469
00:37:26.731 --> 00:37:27.620
and his [inaudible].

1470
00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:28.170
Wow.

1471
00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:28.771
What's his name?

1472
00:37:28.771 --> 00:37:29.880
I never did say his first name.

1473
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:31.580
Edward Edward [inaudible] Mall.

1474
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:32.460
Uh,

1475
00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:32.941
his,

1476
00:37:32.941 --> 00:37:33.420
um,

1477
00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:34.530
newspaper La Liga,

1478
00:37:34.531 --> 00:37:36.870
her po hadn't been a very,

1479
00:37:36.871 --> 00:37:39.840
at the forefront of denouncing the scandals of the republic,

1480
00:37:39.841 --> 00:37:42.980
arguing that the scandals were inherent in a republic bites,

1481
00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:45.030
very form of his very existence.

1482
00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:50.360
And by the fact that is that Jews who dominate the dodge ball,

1483
00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:53.750
that is the wall of money controlled by the Rashi Lynn.

1484
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:54.540
All of this,

1485
00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:55.373
the usual,

1486
00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:55.531
uh,

1487
00:37:55.531 --> 00:37:56.101
kind of,

1488
00:37:56.101 --> 00:37:56.730
uh,

1489
00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:56.941
uh,

1490
00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:57.870
of claims.

1491
00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:58.471
Um,

1492
00:37:58.471 --> 00:38:01.430
he had published a book in which he claimed that Jewish financiers were

1493
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:06.060
conspiring to dominate France and that they indeed had done so.

1494
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:07.140
Um,

1495
00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:07.930
and,

1496
00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:08.750
um,

1497
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:09.421
he,

1498
00:38:09.421 --> 00:38:10.254
um,

1499
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:11.431
I,

1500
00:38:11.431 --> 00:38:13.320
he is at the forefront of this,

1501
00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:13.921
of,

1502
00:38:13.921 --> 00:38:15.000
of l'affaire.

1503
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:17.850
And what the affair does is it pits,

1504
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.601
uh,

1505
00:38:18.601 --> 00:38:19.590
basically,

1506
00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:20.700
um,

1507
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.260
against it pits,

1508
00:38:22.261 --> 00:38:27.261
right against left it pits the French army and the Catholic Church and the

1509
00:38:28.621 --> 00:38:31.170
monarchists who are against Dreyfus.

1510
00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:36.070
It pits them against the Republicans against Socialists,

1511
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.510
uh,

1512
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:40.360
who supported Alfred Dreyfus.

1513
00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:43.060
Now he's worth a,

1514
00:38:43.061 --> 00:38:43.770
um,

1515
00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:43.971
he,

1516
00:38:43.971 --> 00:38:44.121
he,

1517
00:38:44.121 --> 00:38:45.490
he's worth a minute.

1518
00:38:45.491 --> 00:38:45.701
In fact,

1519
00:38:45.701 --> 00:38:46.730
there's a very good book called love it.

1520
00:38:46.731 --> 00:38:47.080
And again,

1521
00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:47.381
my mind,

1522
00:38:47.381 --> 00:38:48.280
my former student,

1523
00:38:48.281 --> 00:38:49.180
Michael Burns called,

1524
00:38:49.181 --> 00:38:49.690
uh,

1525
00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:50.141
Dreyfus,

1526
00:38:50.141 --> 00:38:52.510
a family affair about the Dreyfus family,

1527
00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:53.560
not just about Dreyfus.

1528
00:38:53.561 --> 00:38:55.180
There've been probably 40 books are written about him,

1529
00:38:55.181 --> 00:38:56.170
but it's about his whole family.

1530
00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:56.890
And it's,

1531
00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:58.840
that's interesting in itself.

1532
00:38:58.900 --> 00:38:59.970
He was a sign of a,

1533
00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:03.130
an old Jewish family from El Sauce.

1534
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:03.850
Uh,

1535
00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:07.120
his family had been paddlers and there were many Jewish peddlers,

1536
00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:07.691
uh,

1537
00:39:07.691 --> 00:39:07.921
in,

1538
00:39:07.921 --> 00:39:08.190
in,

1539
00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:08.511
in,

1540
00:39:08.511 --> 00:39:09.191
in eastern Europe,

1541
00:39:09.191 --> 00:39:10.030
particularly in Poland,

1542
00:39:10.031 --> 00:39:11.020
but in other places,

1543
00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:11.920
uh,

1544
00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.000
as well.

1545
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.661
Uh,

1546
00:39:13.661 --> 00:39:14.560
his family,

1547
00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:14.980
uh,

1548
00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:19.980
became a textile manufacturers in the town of [inaudible] and they ended up in a

1549
00:39:20.411 --> 00:39:20.651
place,

1550
00:39:20.651 --> 00:39:23.350
a beautiful place called Rebo VA where the Ah,

1551
00:39:23.351 --> 00:39:24.100
that awesome.

1552
00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:25.330
It was a magnificent,

1553
00:39:25.331 --> 00:39:26.110
where the Vin,

1554
00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:27.730
the vineyards go right down to the,

1555
00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:28.330
uh,

1556
00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:29.380
right down to the,

1557
00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:29.690
uh,

1558
00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:30.523
the book.

1559
00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:31.300
Um,

1560
00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:31.511
and,

1561
00:39:31.511 --> 00:39:36.511
but they're assimilated and probably consider themselves French following 1871

1562
00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:37.960
for obvious reasons.

1563
00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:40.660
They move and they moved to Paris.

1564
00:39:40.661 --> 00:39:41.800
They moved to the 16th.

1565
00:39:41.801 --> 00:39:42.551
They're only small.

1566
00:39:42.551 --> 00:39:45.100
That is the fancy part of Paris.

1567
00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:45.971
Now again,

1568
00:39:45.971 --> 00:39:47.320
in the history of Jewish,

1569
00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:47.920
uh,

1570
00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:48.753
movement,

1571
00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:52.810
physical movement in France and from other places to France,

1572
00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:57.760
you have a growing gap between assimilated Jews with origins in,

1573
00:39:57.761 --> 00:40:02.620
in Germany or El Sas and other places who were more assimilated,

1574
00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:03.483
who come,

1575
00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:04.720
who have more money.

1576
00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:05.591
They're more free.

1577
00:40:05.591 --> 00:40:05.861
K,

1578
00:40:05.861 --> 00:40:06.581
they have more money.

1579
00:40:06.581 --> 00:40:07.660
They're not all wealthy,

1580
00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:12.600
but they see themselves as very assimilated and they live in the fancier

1581
00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:13.443
quarters.

1582
00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.221
And the,

1583
00:40:14.221 --> 00:40:19.030
the huge number of Jewish immigrants who arrived with virtually nothing from the

1584
00:40:19.031 --> 00:40:19.870
old Pale,

1585
00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:20.440
uh,

1586
00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.570
from where they were allowed to settle in the,

1587
00:40:22.571 --> 00:40:23.171
in the,

1588
00:40:23.171 --> 00:40:24.910
and the Russian empire.

1589
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.020
And from Poland.

1590
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:30.100
Poland had lost his independence in 1795 and wouldn't get it again until,

1591
00:40:30.101 --> 00:40:30.490
uh,

1592
00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:31.390
was a third partition.

1593
00:40:31.391 --> 00:40:33.550
It wouldn't get it again until 1918.

1594
00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:36.460
And they come to Paris carrying virtually nothing.

1595
00:40:36.461 --> 00:40:39.580
There's one story about these Jews who carried an empty suitcase and they said,

1596
00:40:39.581 --> 00:40:41.920
why are you carrying an empty suitcase when you're leaving Russia?

1597
00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:42.671
And they said,

1598
00:40:42.671 --> 00:40:44.830
because it's too shameful to have nothing to carry.

1599
00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:47.050
We want people to think that we have enough.

1600
00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:47.913
We have something.

1601
00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:48.813
And they had nothing.

1602
00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.230
And they get to Paris.

1603
00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:51.850
And some of the assembly that juice said,

1604
00:40:51.851 --> 00:40:52.121
hey,

1605
00:40:52.121 --> 00:40:55.540
we don't want those people here because they're going to fit into this

1606
00:40:55.541 --> 00:40:57.940
antisemitic propaganda of these characters.

1607
00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:01.630
The dirty Jew coming from Poland coming from Congress,

1608
00:41:01.631 --> 00:41:02.650
Poland coming from,

1609
00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:03.753
from Russia.

1610
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.730
And they settle into my hay in Paris.

1611
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:07.300
Uh,

1612
00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:07.600
uh,

1613
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.220
and they work in the garment industry.

1614
00:41:09.221 --> 00:41:11.650
And some of them are anarchists and some of them are Marxists.

1615
00:41:11.651 --> 00:41:12.100
And,

1616
00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:13.690
and they were all extremely interesting people,

1617
00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.450
but Dreyfus and his family was extremely assimilated.

1618
00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.010
They were of some means.

1619
00:41:18.011 --> 00:41:20.050
And so they live in the fancy,

1620
00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:20.680
uh,

1621
00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.090
the fancy neighborhoods.

1622
00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:22.990
Um,

1623
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:26.110
and I'm now in 1894.

1624
00:41:26.111 --> 00:41:27.400
I'll just tell the story very briefly,

1625
00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:28.060
uh,

1626
00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:28.920
for those who had,

1627
00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.430
haven't had time to read it yet,

1628
00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:33.470
evidence surfaced from a wastepaper basket,

1629
00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:34.340
uh,

1630
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:39.320
in the office of a German military attache than somebody in the French army was

1631
00:41:39.321 --> 00:41:44.321
passing secret information to the Germans about French military operations on

1632
00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:46.920
the edge of a,

1633
00:41:46.921 --> 00:41:48.850
on the new frontier that is the voltage.

1634
00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:49.120
And,

1635
00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:49.340
and,

1636
00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:49.701
and,

1637
00:41:49.701 --> 00:41:50.190
uh,

1638
00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:55.190
Alsace and Lorraine and circumstantial evidence pointed to a Captain Dreyfus,

1639
00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:57.530
uh,

1640
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:58.363
uh,

1641
00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.250
and they confront him with the evidence.

1642
00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.750
It looks like his handwriting.

1643
00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:03.891
And when they do this,

1644
00:42:03.891 --> 00:42:05.360
this is very military gesture.

1645
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:08.230
They gave him a present him with a pistol saying,

1646
00:42:08.231 --> 00:42:09.950
you too can blot your brains.

1647
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.450
And in doing so,

1648
00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:13.160
admit your guilt.

1649
00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:14.300
And he was shocked.

1650
00:42:14.301 --> 00:42:14.541
He said,

1651
00:42:14.541 --> 00:42:14.641
well,

1652
00:42:14.641 --> 00:42:15.620
she's fuck who Bob.

1653
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.891
I mean,

1654
00:42:15.891 --> 00:42:16.724
I didn't do this.

1655
00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:18.163
It's not me.

1656
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:19.393
That's not me.

1657
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:20.870
But that didn't matter,

1658
00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:21.590
uh,

1659
00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:22.270
to,

1660
00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:22.490
uh,

1661
00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:23.690
the army at all.

1662
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:25.490
They convene him with,

1663
00:42:25.491 --> 00:42:27.530
and the writing did look like his writing too.

1664
00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:30.950
But then more things would come along to devastate the whole case.

1665
00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:31.550
Uh,

1666
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:32.600
they can invoke a,

1667
00:42:32.601 --> 00:42:33.500
a secret,

1668
00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:36.680
a court martial and find him guilty of treason.

1669
00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.840
He was stripped of his rank in a ceremony at the academy.

1670
00:42:39.841 --> 00:42:41.870
Did he tear the big military school?

1671
00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:42.501
Uh,

1672
00:42:42.501 --> 00:42:46.910
and he sent a devil's island about what you have heard off the coast of South

1673
00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:48.050
America,

1674
00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:48.890
the northern coast,

1675
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:50.210
a Hellhole,

1676
00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:54.350
yet more documents continued to be leaked.

1677
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:55.191
Uh,

1678
00:42:55.191 --> 00:42:55.760
and,

1679
00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.690
uh,

1680
00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:58.460
the new chief of army intelligence,

1681
00:42:58.461 --> 00:43:00.010
a guy a called peacock.

1682
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:01.610
The name doesn't matter what doesn't matter,

1683
00:43:01.611 --> 00:43:03.350
but you don't have to know what for this,

1684
00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.250
uh,

1685
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:07.400
said that comes to the conclusion that it wasn't Dreyfus.

1686
00:43:07.401 --> 00:43:08.240
It couldn't have been him.

1687
00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:08.630
Uh,

1688
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:10.640
the writings is not really the same.

1689
00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:11.290
Now,

1690
00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:16.070
[inaudible] was unlikely hero in all of this scenario because he wasn't

1691
00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:16.910
anti-semite.

1692
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:18.380
He was a vicious anti-semite,

1693
00:43:18.381 --> 00:43:20.390
like almost everybody in the officer corps,

1694
00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:21.120
uh,

1695
00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.730
at the same time.

1696
00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:23.811
And He,

1697
00:43:23.811 --> 00:43:24.140
um,

1698
00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.730
comes to the conclusion that they were pen by another,

1699
00:43:26.731 --> 00:43:27.564
a Frenchman,

1700
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:28.040
uh,

1701
00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:33.040
Esterhazy a Hungarian immigrant to second or third generation to,

1702
00:43:33.291 --> 00:43:33.890
uh,

1703
00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:34.221
uh,

1704
00:43:34.221 --> 00:43:35.000
to France,

1705
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.410
a loss estimate,

1706
00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:37.253
a z.

1707
00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:38.473
Um,

1708
00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:42.320
but higher ranking officers get together and they say it's better to have this

1709
00:43:42.321 --> 00:43:47.090
Jew languishing in misery then to admit that we made a mistake.

1710
00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.140
And then along comes the right wing of the Catholic church,

1711
00:43:51.141 --> 00:43:52.910
particularly the assumptionist order,

1712
00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:54.500
which says the same thing.

1713
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:55.850
He's a Jew,

1714
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:57.650
thus he is guilty.

1715
00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:00.230
And so he is just,

1716
00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:00.680
you know,

1717
00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:01.101
he,

1718
00:44:01.101 --> 00:44:01.940
there he is not,

1719
00:44:01.941 --> 00:44:03.560
and nothing happens.

1720
00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:08.000
They send peacock off to a post in Tunisia as punishment for having discovered

1721
00:44:08.001 --> 00:44:08.834
the truth.

1722
00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.430
And the court,

1723
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:11.020
uh,

1724
00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:11.270
uh,

1725
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:15.650
puts a Esterhazy on trial and military court and he is acquitted.

1726
00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:16.440
Now at this point,

1727
00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:16.760
Zoloft,

1728
00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:17.750
it takes up the case.

1729
00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:20.930
He writes the famous article in a newspaper with the headline grow,

1730
00:44:20.931 --> 00:44:22.880
teach j'accuse he says,

1731
00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:23.990
[inaudible] the army.

1732
00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:26.330
I accused the government of covering all this up.

1733
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:26.870
Uh,

1734
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:28.040
the man is innocent.

1735
00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:33.310
And so the political right and the church hierarchy jump against Dreyfus and

1736
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:35.880
socialists and the generally socialists and,

1737
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:36.420
uh,

1738
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:37.680
radical Republicans,

1739
00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:38.250
uh,

1740
00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:39.083
support,

1741
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:39.540
um,

1742
00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:40.081
Dreyfus.

1743
00:44:40.081 --> 00:44:43.290
The newspaper of the assumptionist order demands that all Jews lose their

1744
00:44:43.291 --> 00:44:44.130
citizenship.

1745
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.570
And Charlotte Rojas,

1746
00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:46.170
uh,

1747
00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:47.370
who I mentioned before,

1748
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:51.510
an antisemitic novelist jumps into the fray a against them.

1749
00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:52.680
Um,

1750
00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:53.520
and soon,

1751
00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:54.060
uh,

1752
00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:55.860
some more documents were discovered.

1753
00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:56.581
Uh,

1754
00:44:56.581 --> 00:44:58.710
and it turns out that these,

1755
00:44:58.860 --> 00:44:59.280
uh,

1756
00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:04.020
they were added to Dreyfus is file long after he was languishing in deck on the

1757
00:45:04.021 --> 00:45:08.580
island and they're suddenly discovered by an ma man called Henri,

1758
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:09.360
uh,

1759
00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.240
an officer and he'd forged them to make,

1760
00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:15.630
make it even clearer from those people wanting to believe that Dreyfus was

1761
00:45:15.631 --> 00:45:16.464
guilty,

1762
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:17.340
that gr Dreyfus had,

1763
00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:17.940
had,

1764
00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:20.010
had done other bad things too.

1765
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:22.020
And so they,

1766
00:45:22.021 --> 00:45:22.690
um,

1767
00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:22.910
uh,

1768
00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:27.660
a morass at one point solutes Henri for his patriotic forgery,

1769
00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:30.240
his patriotic forgery,

1770
00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.940
if that doesn't sound like some things in this country too,

1771
00:45:32.941 --> 00:45:33.774
I don't know what,

1772
00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:33.901
uh,

1773
00:45:33.901 --> 00:45:34.381
what does,

1774
00:45:34.381 --> 00:45:35.160
but anyway,

1775
00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:35.820
uh,

1776
00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:36.720
they finally,

1777
00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:37.170
uh,

1778
00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:37.411
oh,

1779
00:45:37.411 --> 00:45:38.770
he slit his throat in,

1780
00:45:38.771 --> 00:45:39.970
in the,

1781
00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:40.680
uh,

1782
00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:41.580
in the military,

1783
00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:42.780
a prison,

1784
00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:43.561
uh,

1785
00:45:43.561 --> 00:45:44.790
where he had been condemned for that,

1786
00:45:44.791 --> 00:45:45.900
for this forgery.

1787
00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:49.950
And they bring Dreyfus back from his island,

1788
00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:51.780
a broken man,

1789
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:54.180
and they find him guilty.

1790
00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.013
Again,

1791
00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:56.340
a military court,

1792
00:45:56.341 --> 00:45:59.430
you're not talking about a civil court as a military court and they say he is

1793
00:45:59.431 --> 00:45:59.851
guilty,

1794
00:45:59.851 --> 00:46:02.220
but what extenuating circumstances?

1795
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:03.390
Uh,

1796
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:04.223
so,

1797
00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:04.650
uh,

1798
00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:05.550
finally,

1799
00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:07.500
and they send them back to Devil's island.

1800
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:08.340
Uh,

1801
00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:11.220
finally he is pardoned in 1906,

1802
00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:12.353
um,

1803
00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:13.380
uh,

1804
00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:13.681
no,

1805
00:46:13.681 --> 00:46:13.920
he's,

1806
00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:17.400
he's pardoned actually before that in about 1900 east partner,

1807
00:46:17.401 --> 00:46:18.360
even 1880,

1808
00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:19.590
1899.

1809
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:20.430
Um,

1810
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:20.581
and,

1811
00:46:20.581 --> 00:46:24.930
but he's not fully exonerated until 1906,

1812
00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:25.651
but still,

1813
00:46:25.651 --> 00:46:28.920
this was another moment for the right as well,

1814
00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:30.360
particularly anti Republican,

1815
00:46:30.361 --> 00:46:30.631
right.

1816
00:46:30.631 --> 00:46:33.210
Because they had concluded that Dreyfus was guilty by the,

1817
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:37.620
by the very fact that he was a Jew and it was better to have him in prison than

1818
00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:38.820
to suffer the blow,

1819
00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:39.540
uh,

1820
00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:40.021
of,

1821
00:46:40.021 --> 00:46:40.440
uh,

1822
00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:41.250
the army,

1823
00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:41.760
uh,

1824
00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:42.450
having,

1825
00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:42.930
uh,

1826
00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:43.980
been caught up in,

1827
00:46:43.981 --> 00:46:47.520
in its own snare and a,

1828
00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:48.061
I get,

1829
00:46:48.061 --> 00:46:51.830
and he retreated to his own society.

1830
00:46:51.831 --> 00:46:52.170
Devi,

1831
00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:52.940
Kimonti,

1832
00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:53.160
you know,

1833
00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.260
his own his own life.

1834
00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:56.573
Uh,

1835
00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:57.000
you know,

1836
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:57.231
uh,

1837
00:46:57.231 --> 00:46:58.350
amazingly enough,

1838
00:46:58.690 --> 00:46:59.110
uh,

1839
00:46:59.110 --> 00:46:59.943
forgiven,

1840
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:01.590
forgiving for all what had happened.

1841
00:47:01.591 --> 00:47:02.221
And again,

1842
00:47:02.221 --> 00:47:03.031
I said this earlier,

1843
00:47:03.031 --> 00:47:04.050
but it's simply end with this,

1844
00:47:04.051 --> 00:47:08.490
that one of the ironies of all of this and helps us make the point of what

1845
00:47:08.491 --> 00:47:13.260
happens to the right and antisemitism in France and in Europe,

1846
00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:18.560
is that his granddaughter dies in the death camp of Auschwitz.

1847
00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:20.213
I have a good week.

1848
00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:21.450
See you on Monday.
