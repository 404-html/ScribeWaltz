WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.860
Okay.
Today I want to do,
I want to do two things.
I want to talk,
uh,

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.730
about the centralization of the French state and the question why Paris.

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.350
And that's kind of fun to talk about the role of Paris in the centralization and

4
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:18.150
the particular role of Paris in French economic,
political,
social,

5
00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:21.990
and cultural life.
And then I,
in the last,
you know,
20 minutes,

6
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:25.790
I'll talk about why,
uh,
this sort of strange man,
the,

7
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.050
the former miracle baby,
as he was called after his birth,
uh,

8
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.770
the Coulter Shamba did not become king of France,
Henry the fifth,

9
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.540
and why France ended up,
uh,
a republic.
And how,

10
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.110
and that has something to do with the centralization of the French state.
Now,

11
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.620
anyone who has ever spent any time in France at all was ever waited in line.

12
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.640
And in a prefecture and in a pre via or a genre or a or a or Paris,

13
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.530
God forbid,
a roommate for hours,
uh,

14
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.130
will realize that the role of Paris and the role of the centralization of the

15
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:02.190
French state,
uh,
is unique,
uh,
in,

16
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.930
at least in western European history.
Um,
and over the long run.

17
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:08.130
And it still is,

18
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.370
despite all of the mutual halls plans of for decentralization and the creation

19
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:17.400
of regional councils,
uh,
basically,
uh,

20
00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:21.350
France remains the most centralized state in,
in western Europe.
Um,

21
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.570
and the role of Paris in French life,
uh,

22
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.350
does not have an equivalent in other European countries.
Now,

23
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:32.010
let me think about that.
Let's think out loud about that other statement.
Uh,

24
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.720
think of other countries,
uh,
in,
uh,
Spain.
Obviously,
uh,

25
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.560
Madrid modality is the capitol,
but,
but a,
a Barcelona is terribly,

26
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:45.150
terribly important,
uh,
and was always a much more economically,
uh,
important,
uh,

27
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:49.830
city than the kind of command economy that was Madrid.
Or if you think of Berlin,

28
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.160
I mean,
you think of Germany,
a unified Germany or in the,

29
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:57.070
in the federal public before German unification,
uh,
Berlin,
uh,

30
00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.680
it was terribly important.
Uh,
it is now again,
I the capital,
uh,

31
00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:06.240
but Berlin is balanced off by Munich and by Frankfurt in some important ways.

32
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:08.370
Or if you take a little country like Scotland,
uh,

33
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.290
Edinburgh and Glasgow are two major cities.
Or if you take a England,
for example,

34
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.220
uh,
people,
I came to care,
uh,
in very major ways,

35
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:21.900
what people in Manchester Thought,
uh,
uh,
because Manchester becomes a,

36
00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:25.030
the capital essentially of the north and the economic,
uh,

37
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.730
center of production.
If you take Russia,
Moscow was always the,

38
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.830
you know,
the religious,
uh,
uh,
core,
the a ridiculous,
the second just hated Moscow.

39
00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:37.900
It represented all those values that he thought was,
was what was,
uh,

40
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.900
were Russian.
Uh,
but Saint Petersburg Leningrad became,

41
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.020
uh,
the Cap Petrograd Leningrad became a major,
major,
uh,
um,

42
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.190
city.
Uh,
and,
uh,
because of the residents of the czar,
uh,
that's where it was.
Or,

43
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.180
um,
if you take a almost anywhere else,
the officer or Gary and empire,
uh,

44
00:02:57.181 --> 00:02:59.010
before it broke up,
uh,

45
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.000
Vienna was now this oversized capital that,
that,
that,
uh,
uh,
in a very,

46
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:08.920
very small country,
but it was balanced off by,
by Budapest in Rome,
in Italy,

47
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:09.890
obviously,
uh,

48
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.060
Milan and turn were terribly important cities in Rome with just this,

49
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:17.600
a sleepy ecclesiastical,
uh,
capitol full of,
of,
uh,
of tourists and,

50
00:03:17.601 --> 00:03:21.580
and clergy.
Um,
but Francis unique,
uh,
uh,
Paris,

51
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:26.350
the role of Paris and French life,
uh,
is unique.
And,
uh,
that has been accentuated,

52
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.810
uh,
over,
uh,
over the centuries,

53
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:32.880
particular last century and a half by some of the things that I want to,
uh,

54
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.680
talk about.
Uh,
in,
in 1947 about,

55
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:39.080
there was a book published called Paris and the French desert,
uh,

56
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.940
that looked at this sort of a unusual,
uh,
uh,

57
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.040
unusual thing that where else,

58
00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:49.680
but in France would then 97% of the population,
uh,

59
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.670
be considered provincials,
uh,
in a very derogatory,
very pejorative sense.

60
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.460
Uh,
and,
uh,
uh,
Paris,
uh,

61
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:01.820
would be the place that all of the Ras,
gene acts of France,
uh,

62
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.430
would try to go because of the economic,
political,
social,

63
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:10.950
and cultural domination of,
of the capitol.
I will ask you to neck,

64
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.030
uh,
was that,
who's before this course?
Uh,
but was,
uh,
the,
the central figure,

65
00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:20.170
one of them in Balzac's novel,
old go,
he'll go.
He'll,

66
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.470
and he's a sort of a somewhat poor noble from the show haunt,
uh,
in,
uh,

67
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.240
the west of France who's going to hit the big time and wants to sleep with all

68
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:30.940
the right ladies and,
and,
and,
and,
uh,
become,
uh,

69
00:04:30.941 --> 00:04:33.160
become wealthy without doing any work.
Uh,

70
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:37.750
and he became sort of a symbol for this,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
aggressive,

71
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.140
uh,
provincial in this case,
uh,
uh,

72
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.180
sort of poor noble who has to get a to Paris,
uh,
to make,

73
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.810
uh,
uh,
and make the big time because the big time,
uh,

74
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.820
could only be,
uh,
be,
be there.
Um,

75
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.520
now,
I mean,
it almost any domain you can think of,

76
00:04:57.521 --> 00:05:00.190
I'm one exception and this is not the time for me to talk about it though I

77
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:04.750
would love to do that,
uh,
is a gastronomy because although,
you know,
the,
uh,

78
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.710
Leona is considered though they almost not the capital of any region.

79
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.770
It was a second most important city in France and still is,

80
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:15.100
even though it's slightly smaller now than in my say.
Um,
if you just count the,

81
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.910
the city Leona became the capital of French,
like astronomy and not Paris,

82
00:05:18.911 --> 00:05:22.720
but that's almost,
uh,
uh,
the exception.
Um,
and,
and,

83
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.950
and one of the reasons why the role of the domination of the dominance of Paris

84
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:31.060
is so great is precisely because of the centralization of the French state.

85
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.020
You know,
in my memory,
uh,
as a,
you know,
as a,
as a young guy,
uh,

86
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.570
you know,
hanging out and drinking a cheap wine,
uh,
in a,
uh,
in Paris.

87
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.140
Uh,
you know,
when I was doing my,
my thesis,
um,

88
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.660
you could only hear on the news,
uh,

89
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.790
people with [inaudible] accents a giving the news only,
and then they,

90
00:05:51.791 --> 00:05:54.460
before the newest,
they had this little thing they call sult.
[inaudible]

91
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.610
as you are now,
where if you lived in a van,
you know,
uh,
there would be,
uh,
uh,

92
00:05:58.611 --> 00:06:01.490
you know,
you would have a 15 minute,
uh,
uh,
uh,

93
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:03.290
a program talking about local events.

94
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:06.380
And you might have somebody who had an overnight accent,
or if you live in my,

95
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:11.210
say a or a niece,
or you might have somebody with a southern accent giving,

96
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.610
uh,
you know,
the news about local schools and,
and,

97
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:17.230
and having pictures of young women presenting flowers to some,
uh,
you know,

98
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.420
corrupt politician.
Uh,
and it,
it would be like that.

99
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:23.870
But basically the news was always given by people with a northern accent,

100
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.260
either a Illawarra acts I lower valley accent and they're very proud of,

101
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:29.660
they think they speak the best French but oppression,
accident.

102
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.310
But that's all that's all changed.
But the reality of the situation that front,

103
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.540
that Paris is overly dominant,
um,

104
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.490
has not changed at all.
Um,
you know,
I mean,

105
00:06:40.491 --> 00:06:42.680
and Balzac I mean to go to back to above Zach,
I mean,
he,

106
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:46.610
he put it the way [inaudible] view of the provinces.

107
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:49.490
And this is still a still the case.
Uh,

108
00:06:49.491 --> 00:06:53.840
he described provincials as being dominated by routine and monotony in their

109
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:56.690
small towns that they're all the same.
He wrote,

110
00:06:56.691 --> 00:06:59.840
which is obviously not a [inaudible],
not the case.
He says,

111
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.730
provincials are like moles brewing it burrowing and their little plots or frogs

112
00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:09.410
at the bottom of their puddles engaged in sorted trivial rivalries move by petty

113
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:11.870
jealousies,
avarice and material interests.

114
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.920
Since they do not sync about the things that are serious,
uh,

115
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.090
they get excited by tiny things.
Um,
now you used to have,

116
00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:23.690
there's a very famous cover of the New Yorker in which you had,
uh,
a,
you know,

117
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:26.960
a map of the United States I've seen from New York and where you had New York

118
00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:30.470
and then you had this sort of large,
you know,
ditch that are finally,

119
00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:34.130
and then Los Angeles was a half a football throw away.
Uh,

120
00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:38.900
and everything in the middle was this sort of,
uh,
uh,
desert basically.

121
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.920
Um,
and,
and certainly the way that,
that,
that provincial people,

122
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:45.050
including myself and we're legally residents and France,

123
00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:49.130
and we live in all dash and I'm proud of it,
uh,
view per regions.
Uh,
it's often,

124
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.480
uh,
with that same kind of contempt that the parishioners look at us.
Uh,
and then,

125
00:07:53.481 --> 00:07:55.850
I mean,
for example,
in France and one,
if this ever disappears,

126
00:07:55.851 --> 00:07:58.970
I'm going to be one and a happy guy.
Uh,
you know,
the license place,

127
00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:01.700
the last numbers of the license plate tells you where people are from.

128
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.910
So if you have,
if you have a s a s,
you know,
a 61 year from the all,

129
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:07.010
and if you have a 62 year from the [inaudible] la,

130
00:08:07.011 --> 00:08:08.810
or if you have a 63 or for them,
we did dome.

131
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.610
And you can amuse yourself as you're driving along saying,
well,
that guy from,
uh,

132
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:17.010
you know,
from,
from a chateau rue is off to visit his cousin in,
in,
in,
uh,

133
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.800
this and song.
And I mean,
that's the way I get by driving a long rides.
Um,

134
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.490
but,
uh,
you know,
Eh,

135
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.930
during the vacation season in July and August when all of us down here are

136
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.760
inundated with tourists,
uh,
you know,
when people see that was 70 fives,

137
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:35.330
which is the license plate for Paris or I,
this is not on the test.
Uh,
uh,

138
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.950
but it,
or if they see,
you know,
77,
78,
91,
92,
93,
94,
95,

139
00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:42.380
they know it's Paris and it's Paris region.

140
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.440
And they know that there'll be certain expectations,

141
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:50.520
often condescending expectations that will be in the way that is.

142
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.650
And,
and,
and people from the Atlanta and put Azn present themselves,
visa vi,

143
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.600
you know,
we pour a struggling frogs in our little ponds.
Now that is,
uh,

144
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:03.310
you know,
that has changed,
uh,
for,
for sure.
Uh,
but,

145
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.920
but the centralization of the French government and the domination of Paris over

146
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:11.130
the life of the nation,
uh,
has,
uh,

147
00:09:11.131 --> 00:09:13.700
is a very difficult to,
uh,
to,

148
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:17.250
to change over a long period of time.
Now.
Um,

149
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.610
I guess one of the key kind of indicators of what's going on,
I mean,

150
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.270
in terms of economics,
uh,
you know,
the domination did dominance of,

151
00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:29.440
of the Paris region in terms of the economy is that Leon,
uh,

152
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:34.020
which was always Francis,
second city,
uh,
first and gastronomy.
As I said earlier,

153
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.100
uh,
uh,
the,
the Big Bank of Leon,
uh,
the Grady ne,

154
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.140
that is the legal bank,
uh,

155
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:44.300
in the 1860s moves its headquarters to Paris,
uh,

156
00:09:44.301 --> 00:09:47.940
not in Lille as if it's sort of given up.
And people,
for example,

157
00:09:47.941 --> 00:09:52.440
who follow the Leo Opera.
Oh,
I said,
well,
our opera is fine.
Uh,
but it's nothing,

158
00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:57.210
of course like Paris where all the resources are poured into Paris.

159
00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:01.710
How did it get this way?
I mean,
just thinking over the long,
long run,

160
00:10:01.711 --> 00:10:06.690
how did France end up so,
uh,
so centralized,
I mean,
all states,

161
00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.600
uh,
you know,
centralized,
uh,
uh,

162
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.590
became larger and centralized their ability to extract resources from their

163
00:10:13.591 --> 00:10:17.610
population.
If you take Europe and 1500,
year,
1500,

164
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.280
there were about 1500 territorial states,

165
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.520
and they range from big consolidated monarchies like Spain and England and

166
00:10:25.771 --> 00:10:30.540
France to,
uh,
to,
uh,
uh,
bishoprics,
uh,
uh,

167
00:10:30.541 --> 00:10:31.900
such as trigger,
uh,

168
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.790
in Germany that were hardly bigger than the gardens of the Archbishop's,
uh,

169
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.790
who ran them.
But over a long period of time,

170
00:10:38.791 --> 00:10:43.380
state making is one of the central processes in European history.

171
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:48.350
Uh,
the creation of a more powerful monarchal monarchical states,
uh,

172
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:53.420
and eventually of national states with a variety of political outcomes of the

173
00:10:53.911 --> 00:10:58.020
unification of Italy.
To the extent Italy has ever been unified,
uh,
uh,

174
00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:02.850
the unification of Germany,
you know,
uh,
in 1871 in Italy,
in the 18,

175
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.770
a 50s and 60s.
But in the case of France,
uh,

176
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:11.370
if you go to the 16th century,
if you go to these,
these chateau around the Luau,

177
00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.650
and you see all of these,
these beautiful furniture that's been been made by,
uh,

178
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.420
uh,
by skilled artisans,
you know,
when you always see,

179
00:11:18.421 --> 00:11:22.050
as you see this big case with handles on it.
And they were,
you know,

180
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.680
that's where the king's documents and the,
and the,
and the,
and the minister of,

181
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:27.330
of whether the Gal,
the soda,

182
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.980
what would the chief financial officer and justice officer,
uh,
where,
you know,

183
00:11:31.981 --> 00:11:35.160
all their papers were because the monarchy really didn't have a capital.

184
00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:37.530
The monarchy was wherever the king was.

185
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:41.640
And it's in the 16th century that Paris becomes the capitol.

186
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.360
Paris is not in the middle of France as you can clearly see.
Uh,
but you're,

187
00:11:45.361 --> 00:11:48.240
you know,
you're not going to have a,
a capital in Mono Saul,
uh,

188
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.370
or something like that.
Um,
and so you ha you have,
uh,
you know,
you have the,
the,

189
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.460
the kings there and the whole process of absolutism,

190
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.150
which you don't have to know about,
but you know,
it's in the,

191
00:11:58.151 --> 00:12:02.790
it's in the 17th century that European rulers,
uh,

192
00:12:02.791 --> 00:12:06.430
expand their power visa vie their enemies,
you know,
land grabbing.

193
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:10.450
That's how France ends up with El Sauce.
Uh,
n,
uh,
as I said before,

194
00:12:10.451 --> 00:12:13.430
increasing their ability to extract resources,
uh,

195
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:17.190
that is to take money from,
uh,
uh,

196
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.670
from a very ordinary people.
And,
and so,
uh,
uh,

197
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:26.450
Louis the 14th,
uh,
you know,
who liked to call himself the son,
God,
uh,
you know,

198
00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:31.150
a modest megalomaniac,
uh,
he sends out officials into the,

199
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.000
into the provinces to enforce his will.

200
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:37.120
And these dudes are called a intendance,

201
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.070
but that doesn't matter if you don't have to remember that.

202
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.840
But they are out there and they'd go through a process of negotiation with local

203
00:12:43.841 --> 00:12:48.250
elites,
with nobles,
and with the law courts.
But in the end,

204
00:12:48.251 --> 00:12:53.110
the only thing that matters is that,
that this increases the power of the state.

205
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:57.190
That is during the period of absolute monarchy that armies become enormous.

206
00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.470
And if you're,
you know,
if you travel around France,

207
00:12:59.471 --> 00:13:02.560
you'll see all the fortifications of volleyball,
uh,
you know,

208
00:13:02.561 --> 00:13:04.950
who is a military genius.
Uh,

209
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.340
we'll ball and fortresses Pepin y'all and,
and,
uh,

210
00:13:09.341 --> 00:13:14.310
along the pier and he's there and up and lead,
uh,
and up along here,
uh,

211
00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:18.460
you'll see these fabulous fortresses and the fortresses had to be maintained by

212
00:13:18.461 --> 00:13:20.140
people who are going to test the guns,

213
00:13:20.141 --> 00:13:23.650
the canons that make sure they work and to be there all the time.
And that's,

214
00:13:23.651 --> 00:13:27.250
you have this enormous increase in standing armies now.

215
00:13:27.251 --> 00:13:29.020
And then the cure comes to French revolution.

216
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:32.260
And what does the French Revolution want to do?
Well,

217
00:13:32.261 --> 00:13:36.550
it wants to rationalize the administration of France and wants to do other

218
00:13:36.551 --> 00:13:41.380
things too,
but that's not this course.
And so,
um,
uh,
instead of having,
you know,

219
00:13:41.381 --> 00:13:43.900
where you,
before you had something like a hundred tolls,

220
00:13:43.901 --> 00:13:48.720
you had to pay on the La River.
If you're transporting some goods.
Uh,

221
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.440
they eliminate all those tolls.

222
00:13:50.441 --> 00:13:55.060
They try to create uniform weights and measures and that'll take a hundred years

223
00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:59.520
before that really works.
But what they do is they increase the power of,

224
00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.410
of the center of the government and in order,

225
00:14:02.411 --> 00:14:06.490
because they're their arch enemies are the nobles who are hightailing it toward

226
00:14:06.491 --> 00:14:09.730
Germany and toward England and everywhere else and trying to launch wars against

227
00:14:09.731 --> 00:14:10.564
the revolution.

228
00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:15.460
What they say is when we will undercut the authority of the church and the

229
00:14:15.461 --> 00:14:20.440
nobles in the provinces by creating what they call departments,

230
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.480
departments,
they popped them all.

231
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.160
And so they create the departments that become part of this administrative

232
00:14:27.161 --> 00:14:30.100
system so that every department,
and this sounds boring,

233
00:14:30.101 --> 00:14:33.760
but it's actually interesting.
Um,
every day pop them all in France,

234
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:38.020
most of them are named after rivers and some after mountains or proximity to the

235
00:14:38.021 --> 00:14:38.920
sea.
Uh,

236
00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:43.950
we'll have the same officials and that these strings that reach out into now 95

237
00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:50.080
departments in France,
including Corsica,
all lead to,

238
00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.530
uh,
to Paris.

239
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.210
And that where someone once said that gall was divided into three parts.

240
00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.660
Now what happens is people living in any region in France,

241
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.900
the three parts that they see are the Ministry of Justice,

242
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.180
the Ministry of war,
and the Ministry of the Interior.

243
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.070
So you have these day pop them all.

244
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:13.730
And these are created in 1790 and they still exist.

245
00:15:13.731 --> 00:15:18.570
The only big change came in 1960 when they consolidate the ones around Paris.
Um,

246
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:22.700
but because of,
of the growth of,
of the,
of the Paris region as you can see there.

247
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.650
So I,
if you take number one,

248
00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.900
but we don't have to go to the mall and I sure we won't.

249
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:31.130
If you take number one of the Al Ain,
it's named after a river.

250
00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:35.600
Or if you take number two,
the end ais and d is named after a river.

251
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:39.060
And how many hundreds of thousands of people died along there,
uh,

252
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:42.950
in world war one or you take number three,
the same thing.
Yay.
Uh,

253
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.280
they're named after rivers and they don't all,
they're not all the same size.

254
00:15:46.281 --> 00:15:48.460
The biggest physically is Doyle don't join,
uh,

255
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:52.070
which has probably grown because there's so many British lived there.
Uh,
uh,

256
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:56.210
something like 8,000 full time residents.
Uh,
I'm pointing toward the shrunk.

257
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.350
That doesn't do any good,
but anyway,
cause going to get close.
Sometimes I,

258
00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:02.310
I can't see.
Uh,
and then the smallest is the Pyrenees Oriental,
uh,

259
00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.840
which is French w Rusi on which is French Catalonia.
That doesn't matter.

260
00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:10.700
But the point is that the revolution in order to defeat its enemies further

261
00:16:10.701 --> 00:16:15.230
centralize this estate.
And then along comes the little corporal.

262
00:16:15.231 --> 00:16:18.850
It's the little general,
the little a megalomaniac,
uh,

263
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.640
Napoleon and one.
And He of course,

264
00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:26.870
push pushes centralization even further where he liked to brag.

265
00:16:26.871 --> 00:16:28.790
It's one of his famous lines you'll find in textbooks,

266
00:16:28.791 --> 00:16:32.840
but that he could look at his watch and see what all the kids in the least say

267
00:16:32.841 --> 00:16:35.510
that he created the high schools we're studying at any one time.

268
00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:40.080
And He makes state centralization,
uh,
even more important.
Um,

269
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.900
and then in the third,
I mean,
the second empire,
1852,
uh,
18,
uh,

270
00:16:44.901 --> 00:16:47.730
70,
uh,
his,
uh,
his nephew who,

271
00:16:47.731 --> 00:16:52.340
who some wag one's called the hat without the head.
Uh,
Napoleon,
the third,

272
00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.320
uh,
what he does is his,

273
00:16:54.321 --> 00:16:59.321
he uses centralization is that tool of the state to consolidate his own power

274
00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:00.860
and that of the empire.

275
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.510
And that is to undercut the residual influence of,

276
00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:08.180
of the nobility.
If you wanted something,

277
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:11.000
and this is still true in France today,

278
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.710
it doesn't do any good to go to the local notable like you did in the 18th

279
00:17:15.711 --> 00:17:20.330
century.
Say,
Hey,
you know,
it'd be mature,
a little guide.
That would be great if,

280
00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:23.840
you know,
if we,
if we had a school,
uh,
it doesn't do any good at all.

281
00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:24.920
And he realizes that.

282
00:17:24.921 --> 00:17:28.580
And so the patronage of the empires to he can provide railroads,

283
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:33.290
he can provide money for things and that further central Isis,
the state.

284
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:38.420
And so you've got these processes in the 19th century economic processes that

285
00:17:38.421 --> 00:17:43.160
are,
that you find all over Europe that can consolidate the power of the French

286
00:17:43.161 --> 00:17:47.640
state.
Centralized in Paris.
Railroads is a good example.
Uh,

287
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.220
and sometimes I'll throw out examples.
You're not responsible for them.

288
00:17:50.221 --> 00:17:53.130
It's just kind of hopefully interesting for you to think about.
If you think of,

289
00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:57.000
I have two towns down here,
believe a,
B,
r,
I,
v,

290
00:17:57.001 --> 00:18:01.910
e who famous for his rugby and two t,
t,U ,
l,
l,
e.
O,

291
00:18:01.911 --> 00:18:04.050
which is a capital I mentioned the first day,

292
00:18:04.051 --> 00:18:05.580
cause that's where lots of people were hung.

293
00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:10.760
They were the same size in the 1850s but breve gets the railroad and not to the

294
00:18:10.921 --> 00:18:15.240
railroad from Paris.
And so that centralization as a,
you know,
it also,

295
00:18:15.241 --> 00:18:16.051
there are mountains there.

296
00:18:16.051 --> 00:18:21.051
It's easier to build in breve but the state can make or break regions with their

297
00:18:21.481 --> 00:18:22.770
economic patronage.

298
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.550
And one of the reasons why France ends up with a,

299
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:31.650
with a republic and not a monarchy is because these prefects who represent the

300
00:18:31.651 --> 00:18:34.800
republic can go into conservative regions to say,
hey,

301
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.740
we didn't really like the way the elections came out last time.

302
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:42.090
You're miserable council on lot of monarchists there.

303
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.600
You would like a bridge across your river,
wouldn't you?

304
00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.280
And that was the case in our village,

305
00:18:47.281 --> 00:18:48.570
cause there wasn't a bridge across the river.

306
00:18:48.571 --> 00:18:52.080
And there's a little boat would take people across this often swirling dangerous

307
00:18:52.081 --> 00:18:55.800
river.
Uh,
and you want to be your bridge.
Well,

308
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:59.760
let's see how the elections go next time the state can provide these services.

309
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:00.803
And you know,

310
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:05.580
the evolution of banking in the 19th century further consolidates power.

311
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:10.110
There are certain economic takeoff in the 1850s and sixties in Paris because the

312
00:19:10.111 --> 00:19:13.740
state banks are in Paris,
the state financial institutions are in Paris,

313
00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.340
and they can make or break a,
you know,

314
00:19:17.341 --> 00:19:20.340
investment in all of these places.
Now the railroad,

315
00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:25.410
even in our day,
uh,
maybe not your day,
but well,
yeah,

316
00:19:25.411 --> 00:19:30.360
still in your day.
Uh,
I mean,
I was on the Tj the third day it opened,
which was,

317
00:19:30.361 --> 00:19:32.910
it opened on September 28th,
1981.

318
00:19:32.911 --> 00:19:37.290
And I was there on September 30th taking of the trip to Leone though it only

319
00:19:37.291 --> 00:19:39.060
went fast.
Uh,

320
00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:43.480
when it got to a really got to a certain point here now,
but the,

321
00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:44.340
the railroads,

322
00:19:44.341 --> 00:19:47.310
if you look at the map of the railroads and France and anytime you want,

323
00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:50.670
including now all roads lead,

324
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.030
all tracks lead to Paris.
So,
for example,

325
00:19:54.031 --> 00:19:56.490
now if you want to go from,

326
00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:00.120
say you're in [inaudible] and you want to go to Boldo,

327
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:03.870
you're going to be broke.
The reason if you,

328
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.180
unless you can take about eight hours to do it,

329
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.170
because the way you're going to do it is that you're,

330
00:20:08.171 --> 00:20:12.090
you're going to take a train that goes one hour and 58 minutes to Paris and then

331
00:20:12.091 --> 00:20:15.930
you're going to take another train that zips down here in about four hours to

332
00:20:15.931 --> 00:20:20.210
Boldo,
but you're paying by kilometer.
So it's going to be terribly expensive.
Uh,

333
00:20:20.211 --> 00:20:24.070
when I was commuting between the motion Paris,
um,
uh,
you know,
you,

334
00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:28.500
that was still a long trip then.
There was no Tj,
uh,
it was about four hours.
Uh,

335
00:20:28.501 --> 00:20:33.010
and when I once took the train over to,
uh,
to,
to Poitier over to plot,

336
00:20:33.011 --> 00:20:37.200
ta took three hours to get,
because if you go across the lines,

337
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.050
it's not good.
Now,
how to train another,
I mean,

338
00:20:40.051 --> 00:20:44.700
obvious reasons how trains reinforce the predominance of Paris.
I mean,

339
00:20:44.701 --> 00:20:46.840
take my business.
Uh,
you know,

340
00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:51.890
the teaching a profession is that the domination of Paris is such that,

341
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:56.560
that you have this phenomenon in,
in France,
which they still call up,

342
00:20:56.561 --> 00:20:58.700
that they call it turbo puff.

343
00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:03.970
And a trouble train was a fast train before the TGV.

344
00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:07.510
The first ones went to Normandy.
The carry the wealthy parishioners to Deauville,

345
00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:08.170
uh,

346
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:13.170
in a turbo profe is somebody who lives in Paris and whose dream is to teach at

347
00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:14.920
Paris,
particularly at Paris,

348
00:21:14.921 --> 00:21:19.810
one French universities are named very politically Paris,
one,
two,
three,
four,

349
00:21:19.811 --> 00:21:21.700
five,
six,
all the way through 14,

350
00:21:21.701 --> 00:21:24.800
which is a real hole or 13 is probably the worst.
Uh,

351
00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:29.710
but the turbo prof will be somebody who is assigned to a mass and who takes the

352
00:21:29.711 --> 00:21:33.730
train there every day or to tool,
but to Leone also,

353
00:21:33.731 --> 00:21:38.020
since this is only two hours,
this is 440 kilometers,
you know,
two hours.

354
00:21:38.021 --> 00:21:40.180
You can be on the damn train to New York City.

355
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:44.950
And you'd be lucky if you get 80 miles in two hours or an hour and 50 minutes.

356
00:21:44.951 --> 00:21:49.240
So you've got people who live in Leone who teach in Paris or friends of mine

357
00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:53.890
that teach in Lille and live in Paris.
Or I teach in wrong,
uh,

358
00:21:53.891 --> 00:21:57.650
frequently who live in Paris and teach in a wall.
Now,
um,

359
00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:02.850
this is bad because what it does is there sucks local university life out.

360
00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:07.870
And it means that there's this phenomenon of the Turbo prof has been accentuated

361
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.230
by the fast train,
the fast train,
by the way,

362
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.760
keep referring to it is called the [inaudible],
the Atlanta.

363
00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:19.750
They're going to Levy Tessa cause it,
you know,
so hula,
it goes fast.
So I mean,

364
00:22:19.751 --> 00:22:23.590
the 19th century accentuates all of this.
Uh,

365
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:28.450
and uh,
the,
the,
the result is it's still by 1947 when,
when gravity,

366
00:22:28.451 --> 00:22:30.460
he wrote this book called Paris and the French desert.

367
00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:33.980
If you look at an encyclopedia,
uh,
the definition of,
of,
of,

368
00:22:33.981 --> 00:22:38.380
of provincial as somebody who's provincial was still provincial,

369
00:22:38.381 --> 00:22:42.010
someone who is Gauche.
And that's not politics,
who's kind of a Bumpkin,

370
00:22:42.011 --> 00:22:43.360
kind of a [inaudible],
you know,

371
00:22:43.361 --> 00:22:47.140
kind of a day late and a dollar short who lacks Dick's distinction.

372
00:22:47.141 --> 00:22:51.310
I'm reading this right out of the Larousse dictionary.
Um,
uh,
for example,

373
00:22:51.311 --> 00:22:55.390
to have a,
to give the impression of being provincial with,
you know,

374
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:58.300
like you've just arrived at the train from Brittany and Garma Parnoss and you're

375
00:22:58.301 --> 00:23:01.700
just so totally out of what,
you can hardly find the place to buy crap and the,

376
00:23:01.701 --> 00:23:05.830
and that's all you want to do a,
and you're sort of the sort of clueless.
Um,

377
00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:08.980
and so the departments along with the railroads,
uh,

378
00:23:08.981 --> 00:23:13.820
and along with better roads also,
uh,
uh,
and the banking network,
um,
uh,

379
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:17.890
increases,
uh,
the centralization of,
uh,

380
00:23:17.891 --> 00:23:20.980
of the French state.
And I mean,
I can remember,
you know,

381
00:23:20.981 --> 00:23:24.130
this is about 20 years ago,
but there was big demonstrations from people in,
um,

382
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:24.971
uh,
in,

383
00:23:24.971 --> 00:23:29.020
in Brittany because of there's always these boats crashing ashore and oil slicks

384
00:23:29.021 --> 00:23:32.200
all over the Breton and coast or people that produce artichokes.

385
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:33.880
The price of artichokes,
you know,

386
00:23:33.881 --> 00:23:37.060
cause of they may volunteer mean the prices are so low,
they're,

387
00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:40.150
that they're always rushing down to the prefecture and dumping artichokes in the

388
00:23:40.151 --> 00:23:44.980
prefecture and protesting.
And I can't remember.
There's one amazing,
uh,
a photo,

389
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.260
uh,
from the plastic that come called,
which is a big place in Paris,

390
00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:52.580
had big square where you've got these Breton mayors who are wearing their
sashes,

391
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:57.470
the tricolor sashes,
red,
white and blue.
And the police are using the crs,

392
00:23:57.471 --> 00:24:00.200
which are the military police did a little less vicious than they used to be.

393
00:24:00.201 --> 00:24:03.170
But,
uh,
I was in a demonstration against Sarcozi and mid,

394
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:07.570
mid May and the police were the crs with their sort of carte blanche.
Now we're,

395
00:24:07.571 --> 00:24:09.860
we're,
uh,
uh,
we're fairly aggressive,
but anyway,

396
00:24:09.861 --> 00:24:12.140
these police were wrestling to the ground,

397
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:17.470
these mayors who are protesting using their tricolor sashes to,

398
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:20.990
you know,
you know,
threatening to strangle them with their own,
uh,
uh,
uh,

399
00:24:20.991 --> 00:24:25.310
sashes of their authority.
I mean,
only in France would this be possible.
Uh,

400
00:24:25.311 --> 00:24:27.880
and so every government that comes to part of,
they say,
well,

401
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:30.980
we're going to do something about this.
You know,
the golf said,
let the,
you know,

402
00:24:30.981 --> 00:24:33.190
he didn't really say that was mild,
but let the,
you know,

403
00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:37.040
hundreds of thousands of flowers bloom.
But the gall,
I mean to go,

404
00:24:37.041 --> 00:24:39.050
who will talk about later mean to goal said,

405
00:24:39.051 --> 00:24:42.680
how in the hell can you run up a state in which they're 440 different kinds of

406
00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:44.870
cheese?
I mean there are a lot more than that.

407
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:47.780
And he believed that it was insidious in order to,

408
00:24:47.781 --> 00:24:51.890
to have these sort of regional cultures.
I mean it was,
I'll give you an example.

409
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:56.660
It was illegal.
It is still illegal in France to name a baby,

410
00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:00.890
a name that is not officially approved.
Absolutely.
There was a,
uh,

411
00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:02.150
or even to adopt one.

412
00:25:02.151 --> 00:25:06.240
There's a famous case in the 1970s or eighties there was a family called tone.

413
00:25:06.241 --> 00:25:10.400
You own a Tonio as a cigarette butt.
And when they tried to adopt a baby,

414
00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:14.090
that would be called a,
let's say as you won't Phillipe tone y'all.
They said,

415
00:25:14.091 --> 00:25:17.060
oh no,
that baby would be damaged by having such a last name.

416
00:25:17.061 --> 00:25:18.770
You don't have the right to adopt this baby.

417
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:23.180
And there were cases where Breton's tried to name their children Breton names

418
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:26.720
and the French state said,
ah,
ah,

419
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:30.950
because it wasn't a officially French.
Well,

420
00:25:30.951 --> 00:25:34.790
the goal has been been dead for a very long time and there has been progress.

421
00:25:34.791 --> 00:25:38.570
But what has not changed is still the power in Paris,

422
00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.470
in these ministries,
uh,

423
00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:44.720
to dictate the life of a,
uh,

424
00:25:44.721 --> 00:25:48.140
of schools have almost everything else and a lot of the strikes that you see in

425
00:25:48.141 --> 00:25:50.690
high schools and in,
I'm going to get to my lecture,

426
00:25:50.691 --> 00:25:54.230
but you see in high schools and,
and,
and even in middle schools,

427
00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:57.440
I have to do with,
with,
you know,
the state something they saying,
well,

428
00:25:57.441 --> 00:26:00.890
we're going to take away 200 teachers in your department or we're going to,

429
00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:04.220
we're going to maintain a curriculum that doesn't seem to make any sense.
I mean,

430
00:26:04.221 --> 00:26:07.160
my son,
when he was in the,
in,
um,
uh,
seg on,

431
00:26:07.161 --> 00:26:09.770
which is the first year of French high school,
I mean,

432
00:26:09.771 --> 00:26:13.850
they were out blocking traffic until some angry driver rover rolled over.
Uh,

433
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:16.100
you know,
the,
the foot of a protestor.

434
00:26:16.101 --> 00:26:19.760
And then everybody kind of went off on a pizza.
But,
but,
but,
but these were these,

435
00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.820
these were reactions against what the state,
what we're trying to do.

436
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:27.970
Or in the 1980s when there were huge demonstrations by people by favoring the

437
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:33.470
Catholic Church as an institution,
uh,
visa vi education.
I,

438
00:26:33.471 --> 00:26:36.250
it was the same thing with the rack thing against the kind of,
uh,

439
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:41.120
dictate dictates or Dick Todd coming down from Paris.
And when Gumby ta,

440
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.550
whom you can read about am I mentioned the other day when he said clericalism

441
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.680
there's the enemy.
And then you had this sort of campaign against the church,

442
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.940
uh,
particularly the teaching aspect of the church.
That's fascinating.
Uh,

443
00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:56.130
which I'll talk about later.

444
00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:01.150
So France ends up like that.
Uh,
many people,
uh,
uh,

445
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:06.480
saw themselves as I'd made these tray.
That is people who are administered,
uh,

446
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:11.510
who are governed but in the sense of having people passing papers back and forth

447
00:27:11.551 --> 00:27:14.070
and having to sign every damn thing you could ever imagine.
It's just,

448
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.810
it's just an unbelievable,
uh,

449
00:27:15.811 --> 00:27:19.770
before the ever thought of themselves as being a citizens.

450
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:24.630
And certainly there is no other country in the post communist world in which so

451
00:27:24.631 --> 00:27:28.560
many people worked for the state.
Now,
having said that,

452
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:32.280
let me just say as an addendum,
and this is my opinion,
you could ignore it,

453
00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.470
that uh,
things work in France.

454
00:27:34.471 --> 00:27:37.290
And it used to be that 20 or 30 years ago he said nothing in France works and

455
00:27:37.291 --> 00:27:39.960
everything works in the u s and now it's just the opposite.
Uh,

456
00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:40.890
totally the opposite.

457
00:27:40.891 --> 00:27:43.920
And if you're going to be sick and unless you're wealthy or you're better off

458
00:27:43.921 --> 00:27:45.730
being sick in,
in France and you are here because,

459
00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:49.440
so the system really works and there are abuses,
but the social security system,

460
00:27:49.441 --> 00:27:53.920
which encompasses more than just what we mean by social security,
the Cecu,

461
00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:59.340
which involves healthcare is one of those things that really works,

462
00:27:59.341 --> 00:28:02.640
is annoying as the whole structure and the taxes and all of that.

463
00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:03.720
And of course the challenge.

464
00:28:03.721 --> 00:28:07.950
So this is the latter part of the course is what do you do with this and Europe,

465
00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:09.590
Europe,
as you know,

466
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:14.430
which is going to erase these license plates and are going to take away part of

467
00:28:14.431 --> 00:28:17.130
what it means to be,
to live in France.

468
00:28:17.131 --> 00:28:19.650
And that's why I would have voted against the constitution.

469
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.110
I encourage people to vote against the constitution.

470
00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:26.790
And I know almost nobody except professors in Paris and Leone who were for that

471
00:28:26.791 --> 00:28:31.440
constitution that was defeated a year ago,
May 29th.
So there,
anyway,

472
00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:36.570
now how did this all happen that,
uh,
given the fact in February of,

473
00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:41.310
uh,
of,
of,
uh,
of 1870,
you had a monarchal,

474
00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:45.180
a monarchist dominated assembly elected,
uh,

475
00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:48.660
in which rural regions particularly,
uh,
particularly,

476
00:28:48.661 --> 00:28:52.800
but not necessarily just Brittany and,
and,
and Norman d and o van.
You know,

477
00:28:52.801 --> 00:28:56.910
these are big still Catholic regions as we'll see later that they wanted the

478
00:28:56.911 --> 00:29:00.960
restoration of the monarchy.
Why does that not happen?

479
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:05.910
How does this country end up being a republic?

480
00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:07.080
The third republic,

481
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:11.940
which has been castigated or been denounced because it seemed to fumble along,

482
00:29:11.941 --> 00:29:14.010
but it was the longest republic.
Uh,

483
00:29:14.011 --> 00:29:17.580
and it lasts from pending on when you start it.
And you can read about that,

484
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:21.150
whether you're the Utah you started in 1875 or 1877,

485
00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.970
or when there really was a republic Republican early eighties.

486
00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:28.170
It lasts until May,
uh,
June,
1940.

487
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:33.570
So how did all that happen?
Now here we move into,
uh,

488
00:29:33.571 --> 00:29:37.030
a history that is the kind of old style history.
Uh,

489
00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:42.130
it's the story of decisions taken by a individual.
People.
Um,

490
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:46.900
there was a pretender to the throne and this man was,
uh,

491
00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.600
got off his life,
got off to an interesting start.
Uh,

492
00:29:49.601 --> 00:29:54.190
he was dubbed the Miracle Baby for reasons that I will explain.

493
00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:58.930
The Quantas Sean Bar was,
uh,
uh,
a borbon.

494
00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:03.340
Uh,
he was part of the royal family of,
of that was a Louis the 14th,

495
00:30:03.341 --> 00:30:07.420
and Louie the 16th.
And,
uh,
uh,
uh,

496
00:30:07.421 --> 00:30:11.350
in 1820,
his,
he,

497
00:30:11.351 --> 00:30:15.520
his father was assassinated by a liberal,

498
00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:18.010
a man called Louisville.
And he's at the opera.

499
00:30:18.011 --> 00:30:20.050
He gets kind of bored and he walks out,

500
00:30:20.051 --> 00:30:23.380
they leave the opera and this Guy Lavelle comes up and he stabs,

501
00:30:23.381 --> 00:30:27.610
puts a knife right through him.
And it was not just a,
you know,
a random act.

502
00:30:27.611 --> 00:30:32.611
He wanted to extinguish this royal line and the Boardmans had been restored in

503
00:30:32.651 --> 00:30:36.340
18,
15,
1830.
Again,
this is her old style history.

504
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:41.170
So France goes into great morning,
uh,
the church bells ring very,

505
00:30:41.171 --> 00:30:46.090
very slowly all over the place because,
uh,

506
00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:51.180
there is the heir to the French throne is dead and there's a huge campaign

507
00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:56.110
against the liberals because of that.
And then Lo and behold,

508
00:30:56.111 --> 00:31:01.111
it turns out that his widow to whom he confessed various infidelities before

509
00:31:01.571 --> 00:31:05.830
expiring was pregnant.
Indeed,
he was the father.

510
00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:07.950
They didn't run DNA tests or anything,

511
00:31:07.951 --> 00:31:12.560
but he was the father and as France held his breath,
uh,

512
00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:17.580
cause they wanted a boy,
this miracle baby was born and no phone do meet hockey.

513
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:23.250
And the unfortunate thing is that he was sort of a sad sack and pull the Tepe.

514
00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:28.510
It's tough being the pretender to the throne.
The would be,
uh,

515
00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:30.640
uh,
Henry the fifth,
uh,

516
00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:35.110
and your name recognition is such that in royalist towns and the east and the

517
00:31:35.111 --> 00:31:36.070
west of France,

518
00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.400
I like know that somebody would in the middle of night would scribbled graffiti

519
00:31:39.401 --> 00:31:42.820
long live Henry the fifth,
and that people would get together in,

520
00:31:42.821 --> 00:31:45.760
in Church on January 21st,

521
00:31:45.761 --> 00:31:49.540
the date that Louis the 16th was executed and they would pray for the

522
00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:52.570
restoration of the Boardman Bourbon throne.

523
00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:57.670
But there's also another family of,
of,
uh,
of pretenders.

524
00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:01.210
And that is the orderliness,
the [inaudible] niece.
But orderliness,

525
00:32:01.211 --> 00:32:04.930
I just wrote there in English.
And these people,
this is kind of boring,

526
00:32:04.931 --> 00:32:09.920
but these people were in government between,
uh,
1830 and um,

527
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.580
in 1848.
And King Louie Felipe,

528
00:32:12.581 --> 00:32:16.480
who was chased for chase from the throne in February of 1848,
uh,

529
00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:19.660
was seen as progressive.
He was seen as the bourgeois monarch,

530
00:32:19.661 --> 00:32:23.470
but he was perfectly noble.
He'd gone to Kentucky and drunk lots of Werblin.
Once,

531
00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:28.690
uh,
he carried an umbrella,
uh,
that sort of middleclass symbol of protection.

532
00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:33.640
Uh,
and he has chased,
uh,
from the throne in,
in 18,

533
00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:38.320
uh,
48,
but he'd helped modernize the economy.
Uh,
he,
uh,

534
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:43.310
uh,
and he did not restore the church too.
It's old.
It's old power.

535
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:46.910
And the orderliness were extremely clever.
We're Shambu was,
was,

536
00:32:46.911 --> 00:32:49.490
was thick as a brick,
um,

537
00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:52.940
and spent most of his time telling antisemitic jokes and playing cards with his

538
00:32:52.941 --> 00:32:55.630
cronies and an Austrian capital,
uh,
and,

539
00:32:55.631 --> 00:32:59.090
and the Austrian capital and mountains near,
uh,
near Vienna.

540
00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.460
Or maybe it was near Salzburg,
I guess it was near Salzburg.

541
00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:05.420
The orderliness had a bunch of sons of Louis Felipe,
who are,

542
00:33:05.421 --> 00:33:09.080
who are pretty clever,
uh,
one.
And by the way,
just about 10 years ago,

543
00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:10.920
the oil and his family suffered,
uh,

544
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.070
it kind of an embarrassing reversal when one of the Orleans,
uh,

545
00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.270
sort of the third in line,
if there was ever an orderliness,

546
00:33:16.271 --> 00:33:20.420
rest of a restoration with throne was arrested for burglary as being an

547
00:33:20.421 --> 00:33:25.130
accessory for burglary in the period oriental.
But anyway,
so when,

548
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:28.370
when France collapsed after the war and went with the cotton,

549
00:33:28.371 --> 00:33:29.780
when the commune comes along,

550
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:33.620
it seems to royalist that is the people who wanted to restoration of the

551
00:33:33.621 --> 00:33:36.980
monarchy that their ship had come in.

552
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:41.240
So what's going to happen now?
It's easy to make fun of,
of,

553
00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:45.890
of Shamba who was a pullover,
a TP,
a sad sack in many ways.

554
00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:50.720
Um,
but the history of royalism is not,
it goes beyond that.
Uh,

555
00:33:50.721 --> 00:33:54.680
and there was a strong royalist movement as I've already suggested.

556
00:33:54.681 --> 00:33:57.980
And it wasn't just people looking backwards.
Indeed,

557
00:33:57.981 --> 00:34:02.400
he said in his various pronouncements written for him by someone else,
uh,

558
00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.570
that he didn't want to be a king of the old regime.

559
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:09.380
He did not want to turn the clock back to 1788.
Uh,

560
00:34:09.381 --> 00:34:13.190
and that you could bind a modernity with monarchy,

561
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:18.430
but there was never any doubt that if he was restored to the throne that he

562
00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:23.750
would rule.
And you have to imagine him after the commune.
Ah Ha.

563
00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:27.230
After the slaughter and the buildings are still burning,
uh,

564
00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:31.520
or at least smoldering that he comes to Paris and he'd never rather,

565
00:34:31.521 --> 00:34:35.050
like Louis Napoleon had hardly ever been in Paris before me.
He really hadn't,

566
00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.120
I don't think ever.
So he gets a carriage,

567
00:34:37.121 --> 00:34:40.790
he rents a carriage and he goes around as a tourist and he goes to Notre dom and

568
00:34:40.791 --> 00:34:43.670
he goes to San Chappelle and he goes to pay homage at the,

569
00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:47.790
at what they thought were the remains of,
of,
of,
of,
uh,
his,
uh,

570
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:52.760
departed ancestors.
And he had bone fragments of what they thought,

571
00:34:52.761 --> 00:34:56.260
or at least,
uh,
ashes of Marie Antoinette that he,
uh,

572
00:34:56.390 --> 00:34:59.570
had with him in his room all the time.
And so,
you know,

573
00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:03.350
but it's not that he has his entourage,
he has his posse,

574
00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:07.500
he has his entourage,
but there also are the strong,
uh,

575
00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:12.230
traditions of popular royalism of ordinary people and peasants who believe

576
00:35:12.231 --> 00:35:15.920
fervently in the monarchy.
Uh,
you found them in very odd places.

577
00:35:15.921 --> 00:35:17.960
There's a strong tradition in Neem,

578
00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.620
one of my favorite places of popular royalism.
Uh,

579
00:35:21.621 --> 00:35:24.710
and also of course in Brittany.
I keep giving Brett tone examples.

580
00:35:24.711 --> 00:35:26.990
I'll pick other ones.
Uh,
so,
so,
you know,

581
00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:31.790
th th and also because of the closest association of the monarchy and

582
00:35:31.791 --> 00:35:36.350
particularly the legitimacy there called legitimate the bourbons with the
church,

583
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:37.891
uh,
you know,

584
00:35:37.891 --> 00:35:42.870
you've got fertile ground in areas that were still practicing a religion.

585
00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:46.150
And we'll talk more about that.
Uh,
another time I,

586
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:51.150
he makes clear that he is going to restore the church too.
It's,
uh,
uh,

587
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:51.541
two,

588
00:35:51.541 --> 00:35:56.520
it's what he considered rightful place of privilege in France.

589
00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.530
And possibly,
I mean,

590
00:35:58.531 --> 00:36:03.531
he could benefit from the wave of religious revival that occurs in France in the

591
00:36:03.871 --> 00:36:06.120
end,
the night in the 1870s.
Now,

592
00:36:06.121 --> 00:36:09.060
every time there's a big time political disaster from the point of view of the

593
00:36:09.061 --> 00:36:13.020
Catholic church in France,
it's followed by a period of,

594
00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:16.290
of religious revival after the French revolution.

595
00:36:16.291 --> 00:36:20.790
And Napoleon and Napoleon makes peace with the church.
Uh,
there is,
uh,

596
00:36:20.791 --> 00:36:24.570
all of a sudden the revival of people forming religious confraternities of

597
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:28.590
people paying to rebuild churches that had been vandalized during the revolution

598
00:36:28.591 --> 00:36:32.610
where they're melting down a church bells to use and as cannon and things like

599
00:36:32.611 --> 00:36:36.510
that.
Uh,
the,
the famous,
a beautiful,
fabulous,
fabulous,

600
00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:41.400
a monastery of a church monastery,
Church of,
of Cuny,
uh,
is,
uh,

601
00:36:41.401 --> 00:36:45.000
of near Mack Hall right here.
I hadn't been destroyed and they tried it.

602
00:36:45.001 --> 00:36:48.910
They restore a couple of the remaining,
uh,
uh,
towers.
Uh,

603
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.420
and as chateau beyond said,
the writer,
you know,

604
00:36:51.421 --> 00:36:54.630
I don't know what we must believe that women must believe in something and they

605
00:36:54.631 --> 00:36:58.950
get to,
he gets on his knees and prays.
The same thing happens in the 1870s.

606
00:36:58.951 --> 00:37:03.660
There's a revival of,
of that old time religion and it's helped by,

607
00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.000
you know,
various miracles and that kind of thing.
But,

608
00:37:06.001 --> 00:37:10.820
which I'll talk about in the lecture on religion,
which is kind of fun.
Uh,

609
00:37:10.821 --> 00:37:13.470
you know,
[inaudible] fun to do.
Um,
if for example,

610
00:37:13.471 --> 00:37:16.980
when you go to any town or any village in France,

611
00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:19.560
you will see what they call a mission crosses.

612
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.260
You'll see these crosses that our stone crosses.

613
00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.250
The first ones were put up during the,

614
00:37:24.251 --> 00:37:28.860
the counter reformation or the Catholic reformation in the 17th century,
uh,

615
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:32.570
to try to win back areas that had become Protestant.
That is around [inaudible].

616
00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:36.150
Uh,
you find some that are put up,
not surprisingly,
after 18,
15,

617
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:41.250
and the others are in the 1860s or the 1870s,
and then never again.

618
00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:45.820
And these are big crosses that are put out usually outside the villages,
uh,

619
00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:49.500
and sometimes times that the,
the crosses were destroyed during the revolutions.

620
00:37:49.501 --> 00:37:53.040
There's a huge interest destroyed and the revolution of 1830,

621
00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:55.110
but most of these crosses,
you can read them.

622
00:37:55.111 --> 00:37:58.980
This is an iconography of belief and you can see the dates because they'll put

623
00:37:58.981 --> 00:38:02.750
the date like 1868,
there's about 10 of them in our village.
Some of them,

624
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.710
there's this little,
you know,
stumps left,
but,

625
00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:06.540
but it's kind of fun to walk around and look at them.

626
00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.320
But here are these proliferate wildly.
And so the,

627
00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:12.780
there'll be missions am I remember when I went to Jesuit high school in
Portland,

628
00:38:12.781 --> 00:38:17.010
Oregon,
we had to have these retreats or revivals and the priest would,

629
00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.500
these missionaries would come in and,
and,

630
00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:23.270
and for three days Sundaram chew and then people would,
you know,

631
00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.700
go off and go to confession and,
and,
and,
uh,
I didn't have much to confess.

632
00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:31.110
I often wish I had had,
but,
uh,
uh,
in those days,
in high school.
But anyway,

633
00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:34.200
there we go.
You'd go and do these things.
Uh,
uh,

634
00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:38.050
and it would be a sort of public spectacle,
a spectacular.

635
00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:42.470
And so Henry the fourth Henry the fifth could,
could,
uh,
you know,

636
00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:46.660
could capitalize on that because there were lots of people that would be very

637
00:38:46.661 --> 00:38:51.290
happy to see him come back because of their,
uh,

638
00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:55.960
belief.
But it's hard if you're 47 years,
uh,
uh,

639
00:38:55.961 --> 00:39:00.490
your job is,
is a pretender to the throne.
Um,
it's,

640
00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:03.280
it's difficult.
He had a hard time getting around.
He'd,

641
00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:08.080
he'd had a very royal accident.
He'd broken his leg,
falling off a horse,

642
00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:10.690
um,
and he had a hit,
a terrible limp.

643
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.510
And also because they just sat around and played cards all the time and ate and

644
00:39:13.511 --> 00:39:17.830
drank.
He became quite a large,
uh,
large man.

645
00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:21.100
And occasionally he would get up.
I'm going to look at the relics of,
uh,
of,
um,
uh,

646
00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:24.910
Marie Antoinette.
And then he'd go back and play cards for big stakes.

647
00:39:24.911 --> 00:39:28.370
He was a big time gambler.
And because he wasn't very good card player,
his,
uh,

648
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:33.340
his posse to confer a,
uh,
for a fairly sizable amounts of money,

649
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:38.290
but he viewed hereditary monarchy quote as the unique port of salvation.

650
00:39:38.291 --> 00:39:42.490
That's a very religious image,
uh,
that could,
uh,

651
00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:47.020
could save a France.
And he talked about strong authority,
uh,

652
00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:50.860
underplaying judicious liberty,
uh,
for example.

653
00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:56.440
And the key to his strengths besides the church is the nobles are the nobles
now,

654
00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:01.210
um,
having a noble title,
then Jude do a hell of a lot of good,
uh,
after,

655
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:05.890
um,
after the French revolution.
Uh,
and it's easy to give this sort of a,

656
00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:09.460
this sort of stereotype of nobles as being just letting their nails grow very

657
00:40:09.461 --> 00:40:11.050
long and,
and,
uh,
uh,

658
00:40:11.051 --> 00:40:14.410
drinking nice wines and chasing each other's Mr [inaudible] and wives around the

659
00:40:14.411 --> 00:40:19.330
gardens.
Uh,
you know,
val cy or anywhere else.
Uh,
uh,
in fact,

660
00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:23.880
uh,
many,
uh,
nobles became chairman of the boards of various companies and,
uh,

661
00:40:23.881 --> 00:40:24.920
it's,
uh,
uh,

662
00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:28.660
there's still had these atavism is these throwbacks to the old regime where,

663
00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:30.730
you know,
it was sad near to lose that.

664
00:40:30.731 --> 00:40:34.330
If the noble announced after mass that it'd be good to have a little firewood

665
00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:38.080
that he could look out from the Ponderosa and see peasants,
obedient,

666
00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:42.970
obedient peasants carrying large stacks of wood up to the big house.

667
00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:47.440
And maybe they get a little something on Easter,
uh,
from,
uh,
from the big guy.

668
00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:52.650
But basically the state was winning the battle against the nobles and you could

669
00:40:53.021 --> 00:40:57.400
still be the,
the co count of anywhere or the Duke of anywhere.

670
00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:02.580
And you can't mobilize goodies to give to local people except on a very local

671
00:41:02.801 --> 00:41:07.780
scale.
And the state,
the state is winning out now.
Gone Beta,

672
00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:12.600
who was a smart guy who dies very young,
he said,
uh,
uh,
that,

673
00:41:12.601 --> 00:41:15.670
that,
uh,
France became a republic because,
uh,
uh,

674
00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:17.350
most of the people wanted Republican.

675
00:41:17.351 --> 00:41:19.960
They didn't want a monarchy and that's all there was to it.

676
00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:25.030
And the elections in the early,
uh,
1880s would certainly,
uh,

677
00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:29.560
make this,
uh,
make this,
um,
uh,
clear.
Now,

678
00:41:29.561 --> 00:41:33.350
there was even a group of nobles who believed that they could be elected,
did,

679
00:41:33.351 --> 00:41:34.870
if you had an election,
that people would,

680
00:41:34.871 --> 00:41:38.120
would actually vote to restore the monarchy.

681
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:42.140
These were kind of the popular royalists of places like,
like Neem by the way,

682
00:41:42.141 --> 00:41:44.150
I should write these things down.
Neem.

683
00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:47.923
See the older gene,

684
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:51.860
there would've been an s there and that's why you got this little shadow up

685
00:41:51.861 --> 00:41:53.780
there.
Um,
anyway,
uh,
but,

686
00:41:53.781 --> 00:41:56.990
but that wasn't going to happen because the most people in France ultimately did

687
00:41:56.991 --> 00:42:01.180
not want a monarchy.
But what about a old,
uh,

688
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:06.110
Sean Bar when he was,
uh,
uh,
you know,
when,
when disaster came,
uh,

689
00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:07.850
he was not ready.

690
00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:12.440
A key issued poorly constructed manifestos,

691
00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.990
uh,
uh,
in order to,
uh,

692
00:42:14.991 --> 00:42:18.800
to espouse quotes the freedom of the church as the prime condition of the peace

693
00:42:18.801 --> 00:42:22.870
of spirit and order in the world,
uh,
and the,
to protect the,

694
00:42:22.871 --> 00:42:25.340
the pope was the glory,
the honor of our country.

695
00:42:25.341 --> 00:42:29.870
And the most thing that castable because of its,
if its glory a among nations,
uh,

696
00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:32.880
et Cetera,
et cetera.
Um,

697
00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:37.760
but there was a big problem that for all of his failings,
human failings,

698
00:42:37.761 --> 00:42:41.250
and they were indeed many and his intellectual limitations were,

699
00:42:41.251 --> 00:42:46.250
which were a daunting,
uh,
he was a man of faith,
uh,

700
00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:50.180
and,
uh,
loyal t to his principles,
uh,

701
00:42:50.181 --> 00:42:55.160
for better or for worse in this context.
And in 1789,

702
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:57.560
when the bourbons were when Louis,
uh,

703
00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:01.580
when the revolution came and then executed old Louis the 16th,
uh,

704
00:43:01.581 --> 00:43:06.230
the white flag of the bourbons plain white flag of the blurb borbons sometimes

705
00:43:06.231 --> 00:43:10.100
we're the flirted lease on it and all that was replaced by the red,

706
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:14.510
white and blue flag,
the three colored flag,
the Tree Kununurra,

707
00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.040
uh,
which,
uh,

708
00:43:16.041 --> 00:43:21.041
was a combination of adding the color white for the Boardmans in 1789 to the red

709
00:43:21.981 --> 00:43:26.560
and blue that was there were the colors of,
uh,
um,

710
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:30.740
of,
of,
of Paris,
of the city of Paris.

711
00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:35.600
And in the end,
he refused to compromise.
When his advisers say,
look,

712
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:39.290
we can pull this off if you agree to accept it.

713
00:43:39.291 --> 00:43:43.070
The three colored flag of revolution of the French revolution,

714
00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:47.810
which had killed his family members.
And he refused to do that.

715
00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:51.260
And they tried to make a deal with the orderliness and the orderliness produced

716
00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:56.450
children one after another.
But,
uh,
Sean boy had no children.

717
00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:58.820
And so upon his death,

718
00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:03.890
who is going to follow him if he's going to be king?
And so they propose a deal.

719
00:44:03.891 --> 00:44:07.970
Why don't you be king until you Croak?
They didn't put it quite like that.
Uh,

720
00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:12.710
and then the organist will take over with the red,

721
00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:17.360
white and blue flag.
And he said to his credit,
no,

722
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:19.010
without my principles,

723
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:23.180
I am just as he put it rather than delicately and cruelly about himself.

724
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:27.860
A fat man with a big limp.
And he went back to his castle,

725
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:30.890
antisemitic jokes and card playing buddies.

726
00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:36.190
And so France lurched into a period called the,

727
00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:40.110
the,
the,
the moral order,
the Republic of the moral order.

728
00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:43.440
You can read the details of this,
which are not fascinating,
but what we got,

729
00:44:43.441 --> 00:44:47.070
we'll get through this and move on to more interesting things.
In 1875,

730
00:44:47.071 --> 00:44:51.690
there's an amendment to the constitution that essentially Trent and voted by one

731
00:44:51.691 --> 00:44:56.370
vote,
approved by one vote by the assembly that essentially trans forms,
uh,

732
00:44:56.650 --> 00:45:00.810
uh,
France into a republic in 1877,

733
00:45:00.811 --> 00:45:05.460
a general called Mac Mall,
uh,
who had fought in the 1870,

734
00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:09.270
71 war.
You may think that that's not a very French name.

735
00:45:09.271 --> 00:45:13.290
There's a strong Irish influence around Boldo.
In fact,

736
00:45:13.291 --> 00:45:17.310
one of the Great Bordeaux wines,
it's called Lash bodge lash as in Lynch,

737
00:45:17.311 --> 00:45:21.600
which is an Irish name,
but Mac,
my home was,
was a French,
uh,

738
00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:25.970
and that he is a general and becomes president of,
uh,

739
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:31.190
of the state and he tries in 1877 on the 16th of May to overthrow the government

740
00:45:33.841 --> 00:45:37.650
and basically a question of responsibility to whom it's not interesting.

741
00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:42.660
He fails to do that.
Uh,
and France in the early,
uh,

742
00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:44.280
1880s,

743
00:45:44.281 --> 00:45:49.281
you have this sort of rooting of the republic and a rooting in the Republic of

744
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:53.580
the republic because most people in France wanted one.

745
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:56.460
It seemed to be the regime,
the divided France least.

746
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.720
What gumby talk called the Nouvelle Kush or the new social strata,

747
00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:05.910
the new social strata,
the middle classes,
the petty bourgeois,
uh,

748
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.500
workers.
Obviously I didn't want a monarchy,
uh,
but in,
in,
in many areas of France,

749
00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:14.140
particularly in the south,
lots of peasants did it,
did want to,
uh,

750
00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:18.180
did want to republic and France,
uh,
uh,
becomes,
uh,

751
00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:20.900
becomes a republic.
And this republic is,

752
00:46:20.901 --> 00:46:25.890
is strongly identified with Paris.
And if,

753
00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:30.180
because of the fear of Caesar Ism the fear of another Napoleon or another

754
00:46:30.181 --> 00:46:33.510
Robespierre before that or another Napoleon the third,

755
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:37.560
they create a executive authority that's extremely weak.

756
00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:43.100
Power is in the Chamber of the deputy of Deputies and the assembly and the,

757
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:45.840
the president is a convener.

758
00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:49.260
He tries to get people to do the right things and it's a political club.

759
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.950
They all,
twice each other.
They,
even if they hate each other's politics,
I mean,

760
00:46:52.951 --> 00:46:55.890
they call each other by the,
the informal name.
Uh,

761
00:46:55.891 --> 00:46:58.230
and even though it's decentralized,

762
00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:02.550
it does not mean that the state is not strong and that the state will not be

763
00:47:02.551 --> 00:47:05.940
making decisions that will affect the lives of ordinary people.

764
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:10.940
And the most controversial of those decisions will also only be in 1905.
Uh,
if,

765
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:14.370
if you exclude going to war and getting all these billions of people killed,
uh,

766
00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:17.220
was the separation of church and state.

767
00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:21.590
And that is the work of a,
of a strongly centralized,
uh,

768
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:26.450
government centered in Paris,
as I said,
over and over again,
uh,

769
00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:31.060
but imposing its will for better or for worse on the provinces.

770
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:34.600
And in doing so,
following train tracks,
uh,

771
00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:37.020
following the roads,
uh,

772
00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:41.290
following these centralized sort of vines that going out from Paris into the

773
00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:45.070
provinces as a way of exerting its will,

774
00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:50.170
its influence and its patronage.
And then conclusion,

775
00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:54.520
the state becomes the,
becomes the new ways that,

776
00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:58.990
that patronage,
uh,
economic,
financial,
cultural,
uh,

777
00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:03.580
political is dispensed.
It replaces,
uh,
uh,

778
00:48:03.581 --> 00:48:06.850
it replaces the nobility,
the local nobles.

779
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.590
It replaces the church,

780
00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:14.070
and it replaces the monarchy that most people in France did not want.

781
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:15.580
Next time,

782
00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:20.410
let's talk about identity and let's talk about one of my favorite topics.

783
00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:25.540
The role of the schools in towns and in villages.
Sia.
