1
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:01.561
Okay.

2
00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:03.900
I want to talk about the war,

3
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:04.680
uh,

4
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.590
up through 1916 today and then,

5
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.453
um,

6
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.600
followed by 1917 and 1918 I on Wednesday,

7
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:13.710
um,

8
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.300
on the last day of his life as John Jr has a,

9
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.310
was a troubled about what he was going to write in new many t the,

10
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.850
the paper of the,

11
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:25.140
of the socialist a,

12
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:30.141
a party about whether a workers of France should go to war against workers,

13
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.390
uh,

14
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.223
um,

15
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.720
of,

16
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.553
of Germany.

17
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.701
I,

18
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:37.140
and he,

19
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.310
his decision,

20
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.660
I wish for that matter had been taken earlier anyway,

21
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.860
not just that evening.

22
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.730
Uh,

23
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.170
it reflects a,

24
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:47.910
what is called the Sacred Union,

25
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.150
a union south cray that,

26
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:51.840
uh,

27
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.450
the political parties put aside their differences,

28
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.650
um,

29
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.060
in the war effort,

30
00:00:57.061 --> 00:00:58.950
in the mobilization of,

31
00:00:58.951 --> 00:00:59.610
uh,

32
00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.941
uh,

33
00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:03.720
of the total war that world war one a would become.

34
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.460
And so he did,

35
00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:09.180
he wrote an article with the headline called Onovo,

36
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.493
uh,

37
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.521
forward,

38
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:12.490
or let's go,

39
00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:12.810
or,

40
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.643
uh,

41
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.341
uh,

42
00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:16.490
anyone out to eat in a cafe called lukewarm,

43
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.090
which is still there.

44
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.650
It's not called request home anymore.

45
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.400
Uh,

46
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.580
and he was having a meal and about to go back to,

47
00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:24.414
uh,

48
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.811
uh,

49
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:27.420
his newspaper offices right near there.

50
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:28.231
It's near the boulevard.

51
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:29.064
Mamacita,

52
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.791
um,

53
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:31.590
were a lot of newspaper offices still are.

54
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.830
And a right wing nut put a pistol through the,

55
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.610
uh,

56
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.720
from outside through the curtain into the restaurant and,

57
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:40.554
and,

58
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.010
uh,

59
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.843
blew him away.

60
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.810
Um,

61
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.490
there was a tremendous of turmoil in the street and,

62
00:01:46.491 --> 00:01:46.631
and,

63
00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:48.300
and people who remembered it,

64
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:49.051
including a I,

65
00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:49.590
the writer,

66
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.070
a [inaudible] Guy,

67
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.560
I remember this,

68
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:53.394
this sort of,

69
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.290
this her swell of,

70
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.551
of,

71
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:55.920
of,

72
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.210
of,

73
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.401
of,

74
00:01:56.401 --> 00:01:57.181
of chaos,

75
00:01:57.181 --> 00:01:58.920
but also of apprehension in the sense,

76
00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.761
in a sense.

77
00:01:59.761 --> 00:01:59.911
I mean,

78
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:02.520
it's easy to read this backwards nostalgia,

79
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:05.460
but the sense that things would never be the same again.

80
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.751
Uh,

81
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:07.561
and you know,

82
00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:09.480
Joe has jr has jr has forever.

83
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.540
Angela has a,

84
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.071
uh,

85
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:11.851
died and,

86
00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:12.301
and,

87
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:12.870
uh,

88
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.410
the world,

89
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.561
uh,

90
00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:13.980
went,

91
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.090
went to war.

92
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.961
Um,

93
00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:18.210
and the way the war started,

94
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.631
uh,

95
00:02:18.631 --> 00:02:20.070
started as if the,

96
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.701
uh,

97
00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:24.090
in the way that the military planners had wanted to start.

98
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.840
I left you last time with the Schlieffen plan.

99
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.161
Uh,

100
00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:30.030
and Schlieffen,

101
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.750
uh,

102
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.660
literally on his deathbed said that the last German soldier,

103
00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:35.370
his sleeve should touch the,

104
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.851
uh,

105
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:36.360
the Mar,

106
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.800
the,

107
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.011
uh,

108
00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:37.591
the mosh,

109
00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:39.180
the English Channel,

110
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.961
uh,

111
00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:42.690
and that in order to put,

112
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.870
put France into a headlock,

113
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.330
put Paris into a headlock like that,

114
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.870
you should sweep this way through Belgium.

115
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.500
They'd eliminated the Netherlands as part of that invasion route that would come

116
00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:56.430
and World War II.

117
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:57.211
Uh,

118
00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:58.440
but they didn't need the Netherlands.

119
00:02:58.441 --> 00:02:59.230
In this case.

120
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.010
They would march into

121
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.020
<v 1>neutral Belgium neutral sense,</v>

122
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:03.070
1831,

123
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.090
uh,

124
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.680
knowing that this would bring,

125
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:06.040
uh,

126
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.000
the British into the war because the British could never have Belgium,

127
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.160
a occupied by a,

128
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.363
uh,

129
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.910
a potentially very hostile,

130
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.361
uh,

131
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:17.194
power.

132
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.250
Um,

133
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.690
and so Germany is under pressure to win the war quickly.

134
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.291
Uh,

135
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:23.651
they,

136
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:25.210
as I said at the end of the last time,

137
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.611
well,

138
00:03:25.611 --> 00:03:26.200
that's lecture.

139
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.700
They anticipate about two weeks.

140
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:28.534
It's going to take,

141
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.080
uh,

142
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.900
the big Russian bear to bring all of these,

143
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:32.860
these forces,

144
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.491
uh,

145
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:35.890
in many cases using that single track railroad,

146
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.371
uh,

147
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:38.020
they went all the way to Vladivostok,

148
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.800
uh,

149
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.510
to,

150
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.940
uh,

151
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.940
prepare to invade a Germany or to defend against a German incursions,

152
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.850
uh,

153
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:47.683
into,

154
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.000
uh,

155
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.120
into Russia.

156
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.871
Uh,

157
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:51.220
and so it was this,

158
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:52.060
someone once said,

159
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:53.420
and I don't remember who is of Schlieffen,

160
00:03:53.421 --> 00:03:55.690
is dead hand automatically,

161
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.111
uh,

162
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:57.880
pulled the trigger,

163
00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:58.091
uh,

164
00:03:58.091 --> 00:03:58.571
when,

165
00:03:58.571 --> 00:03:58.721
uh,

166
00:03:58.721 --> 00:03:59.380
the German,

167
00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.860
uh,

168
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.161
when the,

169
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:02.290
when the Belgian government on the 2nd of August,

170
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.711
uh,

171
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:07.630
rejected German demands of that his armies could march through Belgium,

172
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.321
uh,

173
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:10.960
and the Belgian army a fought bravely,

174
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.640
uh,

175
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.830
uh,

176
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.600
indeed very heroically against a overpowering military strength,

177
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.740
uh,

178
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.610
big fortress of,

179
00:04:18.611 --> 00:04:19.020
of,

180
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.230
uh,

181
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.440
of the edge.

182
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.951
Uh,

183
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:21.790
when it gets to a close here,

184
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:22.271
I can't see,

185
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:23.670
but when the edge there,

186
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.460
uh,

187
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.293
falls,

188
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.961
uh,

189
00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:26.351
and,

190
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:26.710
uh,

191
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.190
uh,

192
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.870
falls to the young,

193
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.011
not so young,

194
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:30.380
but well,

195
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.120
commander,

196
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.301
uh,

197
00:04:31.301 --> 00:04:32.220
alughten Dorf,

198
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.950
uh,

199
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.940
after a huge,

200
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.010
a bombardment on the 16th,

201
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.611
uh,

202
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:39.860
followed by the fall of Namu.

203
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.073
And once,

204
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.501
uh,

205
00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:42.790
the Germans get through,

206
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:43.241
you know,

207
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:46.000
the hills of eastern Belgium,

208
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.541
uh,

209
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:47.290
then,

210
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.891
uh,

211
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:48.311
they,

212
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:48.431
uh,

213
00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:49.120
move,

214
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.450
uh,

215
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.180
fairly,

216
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.470
uh,

217
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.303
quickly,

218
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.671
uh,

219
00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:52.870
but the German commander,

220
00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:53.860
von Moltke,

221
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.330
Mol t,

222
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.140
k,

223
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.620
e,

224
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.940
the younger multi,

225
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.480
uses some divisions to try to pin down the Belgians.

226
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:04.121
Uh,

227
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:08.920
and he also is having doubts with a view toward the home front of,

228
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:09.490
uh,

229
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.570
of wanting,

230
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.070
of fearing how far the French in there never will penetration of Alsace Indo

231
00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:16.000
else last Uren,

232
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.700
uh,

233
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.533
would go,

234
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.070
it's over indeed franchise advances in El Sauce,

235
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.690
although they had been anticipated by Schlieffen as inevitable and not crucial

236
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:26.950
to the winning of the war,

237
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.790
uh,

238
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.860
in a very timely fashion,

239
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.380
uh,

240
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.190
now lead a von Moltke to transfer,

241
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.551
uh,

242
00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:34.384
troops,

243
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.170
uh,

244
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.291
uh,

245
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:39.160
fearing that the homefront might despair of French advances there.

246
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.220
And so what this means is that the Germans have basically fewer troops than had

247
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:45.250
been anticipated,

248
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.701
uh,

249
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:46.330
in,

250
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.721
uh,

251
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:47.590
the original,

252
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.550
uh,

253
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.870
in the original plan,

254
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.531
uh,

255
00:05:50.531 --> 00:05:51.070
by,

256
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.161
uh,

257
00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:52.060
von Schlieffen.

258
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.110
And sure enough,

259
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.680
the British,

260
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.960
the British expeditionary force,

261
00:05:55.961 --> 00:05:57.950
which was not a large army,

262
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.610
finally arrives on the 20th of,

263
00:06:00.611 --> 00:06:01.060
of,

264
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.220
uh,

265
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.053
August,

266
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.810
uh,

267
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:03.643
more,

268
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.250
um,

269
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.500
uh,

270
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.111
in,

271
00:06:05.111 --> 00:06:05.450
um,

272
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.100
in southern and in Belgium.

273
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.060
Uh,

274
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.120
but everybody's fairly sure that the war is going to be over,

275
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.133
um,

276
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.760
a fairly soon.

277
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.760
But one of the things that happens immediately now,

278
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:18.720
how do I do this?

279
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.120
One of the things that happens almost immediately is that the Germans are

280
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:23.490
marching,

281
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.270
Socorro so quickly and so rapidly,

282
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.050
uh,

283
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.820
that they become a fatigued,

284
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.271
uh,

285
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:29.900
by,

286
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.141
uh,

287
00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:31.490
the pace of their march.

288
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:32.600
And also problems,

289
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.081
uh,

290
00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:33.680
with,

291
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.010
uh,

292
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.510
with communications.

293
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:36.643
Um,

294
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.691
and in,

295
00:06:37.691 --> 00:06:38.780
in indeed the army,

296
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:39.360
the command,

297
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.190
the army is commanded by I forgettable guy called Kook.

298
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.791
Uh,

299
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:46.070
it's spread too thinly across a wide,

300
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.880
uh,

301
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.600
front.

302
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.881
Uh,

303
00:06:47.881 --> 00:06:49.700
and that fitness made more,

304
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:50.480
um,

305
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.750
uh,

306
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.810
more serious by the departure of troops to fight,

307
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.201
uh,

308
00:06:54.201 --> 00:06:55.220
in Alsace.

309
00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:56.120
And also by,

310
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.750
uh,

311
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.200
uh,

312
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.320
troop still left in chasing down and rounding up,

313
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.650
uh,

314
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:01.970
the Belgian forces,

315
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.480
uh,

316
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.350
in Belgium.

317
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.550
Um,

318
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.190
but he spends four divisions to,

319
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.611
uh,

320
00:07:07.611 --> 00:07:08.930
Russia as a way.

321
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.990
And also because the Russians have advanced form or rapidly than he thought was

322
00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:15.740
ever possible.

323
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.810
And so one of the things,

324
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.240
uh,

325
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:18.521
that,

326
00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:18.920
that,

327
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.753
uh,

328
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.400
that the German high command does is instead of going,

329
00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:22.670
you know,

330
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.750
all the way this way,

331
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:24.770
they turned down,

332
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.490
uh,

333
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.230
they turned down south and then,

334
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:27.501
uh,

335
00:07:27.501 --> 00:07:28.670
south east,

336
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:29.390
uh,

337
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.890
quicker than had been,

338
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.520
uh,

339
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.353
originally,

340
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.180
uh,

341
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.430
originally plan,

342
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.300
um,

343
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.950
and despite huge losses on both sides,

344
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.720
the German side in the French side,

345
00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:44.600
and then with the British also getting into the action,

346
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:45.321
uh,

347
00:07:45.321 --> 00:07:45.980
the,

348
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.980
the German forces are within 35 miles of Paris,

349
00:07:51.171 --> 00:07:53.480
35 miles within Paris,

350
00:07:53.481 --> 00:07:56.300
so that you could hear the cannon in Paris,

351
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.130
uh,

352
00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:57.320
uh,

353
00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:57.990
from,

354
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.190
uh,

355
00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.430
the fighting just east and north of the capital.

356
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.520
Now if one wants an explanation for how the French homefront was able to hold a

357
00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:11.300
spectacularly through the entire war,

358
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:11.721
uh,

359
00:08:11.721 --> 00:08:15.110
that is one of two key factors and it's the most important,

360
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:15.891
uh,

361
00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:16.730
is that,

362
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.330
uh,

363
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.490
the Germans are so close to Paris,

364
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:19.821
uh,

365
00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:22.310
that they can bombard Paris on Easter Sunday,

366
00:08:22.311 --> 00:08:26.570
1918 more about that later with this huge gun,

367
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:27.590
big Bertha,

368
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:27.950
as,

369
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:28.280
as,

370
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:33.280
as it was called by the English I firing way down from up here in the north,

371
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:35.481
uh,

372
00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:38.000
lobbing these huge shells all the way.

373
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:38.810
Uh,

374
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:39.710
so the,

375
00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:39.901
the,

376
00:08:39.901 --> 00:08:40.721
the pressure is,

377
00:08:40.721 --> 00:08:41.750
is there,

378
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:42.201
uh,

379
00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:43.640
and the response is heroic.

380
00:08:43.641 --> 00:08:44.361
The second factor,

381
00:08:44.361 --> 00:08:45.650
which is often forgotten,

382
00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:46.400
is that the,

383
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.500
this union of the Sacred Union,

384
00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:53.501
this union south bay is extremely effective in mobilizing through propaganda,

385
00:08:54.741 --> 00:08:57.840
but also through a extremely intelligent action.

386
00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:58.740
Uh,

387
00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.630
bringing helped,

388
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.421
for example,

389
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:01.110
to,

390
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.681
uh,

391
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:04.950
two people trying to bring the harvest in a using troops,

392
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:05.311
uh,

393
00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:07.410
and when they have them fairly soon,

394
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.560
a captured German soldiers to help bring the harvest in and they also begin to

395
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:13.460
give out of costume,

396
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.020
familial or sort of family allocations.

397
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.500
Family resources I guess is a wave of,

398
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:19.960
of,

399
00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:20.940
of putting that,

400
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:21.241
uh,

401
00:09:21.241 --> 00:09:22.170
two families,

402
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:22.800
uh,

403
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.390
who the departure of the sons brothers and fathers was a catastrophic,

404
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.390
but of course they hadn't seen anything yet.

405
00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:31.020
Uh,

406
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:35.760
but they're very shrewd in this and the homefront unlike Berlin.

407
00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:36.570
Uh,

408
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:37.620
and that's another story.

409
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:38.101
Uh,

410
00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:39.030
but the home front,

411
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:39.511
uh,

412
00:09:39.511 --> 00:09:40.230
in,

413
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.531
uh,

414
00:09:40.531 --> 00:09:44.400
in France holds throughout the entire a war.

415
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:44.731
I mean,

416
00:09:44.731 --> 00:09:46.140
there are some exceptions in that,

417
00:09:46.141 --> 00:09:48.570
and I'm gonna talk about that next week and it's fairly,

418
00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:48.860
um,

419
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:49.200
uh,

420
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:49.520
uh,

421
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.370
I mean on Wednesday,

422
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:50.761
uh,

423
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:51.511
it's fairly,

424
00:09:51.511 --> 00:09:52.230
um,

425
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.471
uh,

426
00:09:52.471 --> 00:09:53.304
interesting.

427
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.060
Um,

428
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.920
and so as the Germans are,

429
00:09:55.921 --> 00:09:56.690
are trying to,

430
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:57.090
you know,

431
00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:02.090
drive to Paris in what became known as the battle of the Marne at the dawn of

432
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:05.370
Air Warfare,

433
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:06.030
uh,

434
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:06.450
planes,

435
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:06.661
you know,

436
00:10:06.661 --> 00:10:08.300
are their first use of Rocana song.

437
00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.060
Rick connaissance,

438
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:09.990
they're not used for,

439
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.033
for uh,

440
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:11.371
you know,

441
00:10:11.371 --> 00:10:12.420
it really is weapons.

442
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:12.550
And,

443
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:13.090
and the very,

444
00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:13.980
very beginning,

445
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:14.250
uh,

446
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:14.581
there are,

447
00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:14.821
you know,

448
00:10:14.821 --> 00:10:16.980
our attempts to drop small bombs and things like that.

449
00:10:16.981 --> 00:10:17.160
And the,

450
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.070
and the French do this,

451
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:18.751
do this fairly,

452
00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:19.584
uh,

453
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.780
early on in Germany and German cities.

454
00:10:21.781 --> 00:10:23.130
And the Germans do this as well,

455
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:27.360
but there's a guy flying around up there who are reconnaissance pilot,

456
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:27.751
uh,

457
00:10:27.751 --> 00:10:28.230
who know,

458
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.260
who noticed that the qcs army is changing,

459
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:31.710
uh,

460
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:32.550
directions,

461
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.180
uh,

462
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:33.900
leaving,

463
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:34.081
uh,

464
00:10:34.081 --> 00:10:38.640
it's flank open as it moves to a point south east of Paris.

465
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:39.900
And so at that point,

466
00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:40.710
the French rush,

467
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.690
every conceivable soldier into,

468
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:43.260
uh,

469
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.340
into the battle of,

470
00:10:44.341 --> 00:10:45.240
of the mound,

471
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.780
which takes place basically between nine UAE,

472
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:51.780
which is a town you can see here,

473
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.291
uh,

474
00:10:52.291 --> 00:10:53.124
and uh,

475
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:53.331
and,

476
00:10:53.331 --> 00:10:56.490
and Shawn Panio and basically in shuttle on Sham pineal,

477
00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:57.300
uh,

478
00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.290
the battle of the Marne,

479
00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:58.760
uh,

480
00:10:58.760 --> 00:10:59.061
and,

481
00:10:59.061 --> 00:11:00.000
and everybody knows this.

482
00:11:00.001 --> 00:11:03.060
It's a famous story and there's of course a metro stop named after him

483
00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:03.630
inevitably.

484
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:03.920
But the,

485
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.390
but the,

486
00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:04.610
the,

487
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:08.010
the commander of the military defense of the Paris region is a guy called

488
00:11:08.011 --> 00:11:08.710
gasoline,

489
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.861
g,

490
00:11:08.861 --> 00:11:09.530
g.

491
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.520
A.

492
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:11.520
L.

493
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:11.520
L.

494
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:11.520
I.

495
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:11.520
E.

496
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:11.520
N.

497
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:11.790
I.

498
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:12.301
And he,

499
00:11:12.301 --> 00:11:12.690
uh,

500
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.240
can scripts of the taxis have Paris.

501
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.260
And so the presion taxis literally carry soldiers,

502
00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:19.860
uh,

503
00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.100
out to fight in the battle of the Marne,

504
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.660
which can be clearly heard.

505
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:25.680
To repeat myself,

506
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:26.280
uh,

507
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:26.850
in,

508
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:27.060
uh,

509
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:27.893
in Paris,

510
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:28.290
uh,

511
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.210
that there was a sense of impending doom,

512
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.103
obviously,

513
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:31.700
but,

514
00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:32.190
uh,

515
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.230
the miracle occurs,

516
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:34.741
uh,

517
00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:35.430
and,

518
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:36.020
um,

519
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:36.230
the,

520
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.020
the British,

521
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:37.121
uh,

522
00:11:37.121 --> 00:11:42.121
poor through another gap in the German armies of further up along the end river

523
00:11:42.781 --> 00:11:44.770
ais in e,

524
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:45.900
um,

525
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:46.530
and,

526
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:46.831
uh,

527
00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:50.040
for forced them to retreat 40 miles back.

528
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:55.250
And that's the largest exchange of real estate that would occur until 1918

529
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.230
because of what happens next.

530
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:00.940
And on September 14th,

531
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.650
along the end river,

532
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.460
uh,

533
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:08.460
the Germans begin to fortify their position by digging trenches,

534
00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:09.651
um,

535
00:12:09.651 --> 00:12:14.200
and rather like the v the battle of [inaudible] in the French revolution in

536
00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:15.280
1792,

537
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.970
the song culottes that is the ordinary people who defended the revolution.

538
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.970
The Battle of the Marne Saves Paris.

539
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:22.840
And,

540
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.260
uh,

541
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.370
without a question,

542
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:25.463
um,

543
00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.110
uh,

544
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:27.850
saves a saved France.

545
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.130
So then what you've got is,

546
00:12:30.131 --> 00:12:30.631
and you have to,

547
00:12:30.631 --> 00:12:30.880
I'm getting,

548
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.620
I always give ridiculous sports analogies,

549
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.310
uh,

550
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.320
but since most of what I did over the weekend was watch football,

551
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:35.780
uh,

552
00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.420
it works anyway in this case.

553
00:12:37.421 --> 00:12:40.930
And what you have to do is imagine somebody trying to get outside and a football

554
00:12:40.931 --> 00:12:41.560
game,

555
00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.420
a Mychart or somebody trying to get outside,

556
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:44.070
uh,

557
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:44.410
uh,

558
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:45.010
and,

559
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:45.400
uh,

560
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:45.671
you know,

561
00:12:45.671 --> 00:12:46.060
as the,

562
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.480
as the guards pull and as you move toward the outside that the,

563
00:12:49.481 --> 00:12:49.910
the,

564
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:53.180
the defense and above all the linebackers and everybody kind of moves along.

565
00:12:53.181 --> 00:12:55.990
And what you have basically is you have a race to the sea.

566
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.200
They're trying to out flake each other where the Germans are going back to the

567
00:12:59.201 --> 00:12:59.740
strategy.

568
00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:00.790
Penn by Schlieffen,

569
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:01.330
uh,

570
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:02.470
in 1905.

571
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:02.891
It is.

572
00:13:02.891 --> 00:13:03.990
They're trying to get around to,

573
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.211
to,

574
00:13:04.211 --> 00:13:08.230
to go around and then put this headlock and of course,

575
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:08.711
what the,

576
00:13:08.711 --> 00:13:09.490
what the,

577
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:10.080
uh,

578
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:10.510
uh,

579
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:11.300
what the French and the,

580
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:15.160
and the British are doing is they're racing along also to try to steal,

581
00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.030
to keep,

582
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:17.350
to hold their ports,

583
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.550
the French ports,

584
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:19.180
uh,

585
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:19.451
uh,

586
00:13:19.451 --> 00:13:22.120
and also to keep them from being out flank.

587
00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.160
And so then you have,

588
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.560
I mean the famous western front,

589
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:27.191
and that's,

590
00:13:27.191 --> 00:13:28.470
we're not talking about the eastern front of,

591
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.250
there's a lot of good work done recently on the eastern front,

592
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.233
but you have this,

593
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.320
this western front is generated so much to me,

594
00:13:33.321 --> 00:13:34.510
no magnificent literature,

595
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.490
some of which you're reading.

596
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.280
And Bob Lewis,

597
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:36.921
as well as,

598
00:13:36.921 --> 00:13:37.810
as the inevitable,

599
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.440
uh,

600
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.840
all quiet on the western front by Eric Emory,

601
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:41.680
uh,

602
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.513
remark,

603
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:43.120
uh,

604
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:43.660
and,

605
00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:43.961
uh,

606
00:13:43.961 --> 00:13:47.050
the Siegfried Sassoon and the British war poets.

607
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:47.561
Um,

608
00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:49.210
now there were a few journalists,

609
00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:50.710
I can't remember if I mentioned this or not,

610
00:13:50.711 --> 00:13:51.011
who had,

611
00:13:51.011 --> 00:13:52.000
who had followed the,

612
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:52.390
uh,

613
00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:55.570
the Russell Japanese war in 1904 1905.

614
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.690
And they had noticed that in some of these very prolonged battles,

615
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.490
that trenches had been done,

616
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:01.383
been dug,

617
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:02.410
and in the mud,

618
00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:03.260
uh,

619
00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.093
uh,

620
00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.040
and just horribly bad weather.

621
00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:11.420
That two forces stared across a no man's land against each other.

622
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:15.160
And that's exactly what happens in world war one.

623
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.770
And that is to make a very long story,

624
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:21.100
complicated story and sometimes overly simplified story,

625
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:22.150
a very short,

626
00:14:22.151 --> 00:14:26.890
that's exactly what happens on the western front is that the spade and the

627
00:14:26.891 --> 00:14:29.320
shovel along with the machine gun,

628
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:34.410
which is a defensive weapon along with ultimately gas and flame throwers,

629
00:14:34.691 --> 00:14:36.700
there are new ways of dying to,

630
00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:37.030
uh,

631
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.840
become,

632
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.200
uh,

633
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.510
the weapons of the war,

634
00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:41.200
uh,

635
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.790
along with artillery,

636
00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:47.170
which in our artillery kills more people than any other weapon followed by,

637
00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:48.370
by machine guns.

638
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.410
And so basically,

639
00:14:50.411 --> 00:14:52.010
as you can see from this map,

640
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:52.760
uh,

641
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:53.360
that,

642
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.110
um,

643
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:58.580
the trenches go all the way from Switzerland literally to,

644
00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.290
uh,

645
00:14:59.290 --> 00:14:59.540
uh,

646
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:00.560
to the English Channel.

647
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:06.040
And that is where a larger ness of France and these other countries where the

648
00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:07.220
youth,

649
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.053
the young men,

650
00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:08.450
uh,

651
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.810
and some older men to have these countries died.

652
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:12.680
That's,

653
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:17.090
that was the end where their short lives ended in the vast majority,

654
00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:17.840
uh,

655
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.530
of,

656
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:19.041
uh,

657
00:15:19.041 --> 00:15:20.180
of the cases.

658
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:21.050
Um,

659
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:23.330
and attempts in 19,

660
00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:25.220
in the fall of 1914,

661
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.701
uh,

662
00:15:25.701 --> 00:15:29.210
to break through simply don't work.

663
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.690
And it's not too hard to figure out why they don't work.

664
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:36.050
You don't have to be a specialist in military warfare to know that if you're

665
00:15:36.051 --> 00:15:39.270
going to break through like this and you're getting,

666
00:15:39.271 --> 00:15:40.790
you're going to either side,

667
00:15:40.791 --> 00:15:43.190
you pick your side and you're going to get across.

668
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.830
The question is how are you going to do that?

669
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.110
Because by you very quickly,

670
00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:48.740
uh,

671
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.860
the Germans have lines behind for hears from point of view.

672
00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:52.290
The French,

673
00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:52.650
they,

674
00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:52.771
they're,

675
00:15:52.771 --> 00:15:54.650
they're building railroads they can supply,

676
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:55.220
uh,

677
00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.990
and if you're going to go across and breakthrough,

678
00:15:59.240 --> 00:15:59.900
uh,

679
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.970
these are sort of rubber band defenses.

680
00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.170
And in order to,

681
00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:03.710
uh,

682
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.951
to,

683
00:16:03.951 --> 00:16:08.010
to break through with the strategy that they adopt a really throughout the wars,

684
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.310
what we are called creeping barrages,

685
00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:10.941
uh,

686
00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:12.470
is that with all of these,

687
00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:12.651
you know,

688
00:16:12.651 --> 00:16:13.340
these,

689
00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.370
these tens of thousands of cannons,

690
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.420
you'd have to soften up your opposition by killing many people as possible.

691
00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:21.321
So you're,

692
00:16:21.321 --> 00:16:22.071
you're shelling,

693
00:16:22.071 --> 00:16:24.350
you're anticipating where you're going to go.

694
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:26.320
And this of course tips off your opponent,

695
00:16:26.321 --> 00:16:26.510
says,

696
00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:27.200
Aha,

697
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.120
that's where they're going to go this time.

698
00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:32.330
Last time they went down there and this time they're coming here.

699
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:33.860
And so all this does,

700
00:16:33.861 --> 00:16:34.101
I mean,

701
00:16:34.101 --> 00:16:36.200
anybody can see this and you'll see it in a while,

702
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.010
uh,

703
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.690
got live here and not so live,

704
00:16:38.691 --> 00:16:38.921
but,

705
00:16:38.921 --> 00:16:39.400
but we'll see it.

706
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:39.580
Uh,

707
00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:40.000
uh,

708
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.250
uh,

709
00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:45.020
I on your screen is that these creeping barrages besides killing lots of,

710
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:45.231
you know,

711
00:16:45.231 --> 00:16:47.600
the Americans invented the term friendly fire,

712
00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:48.170
uh,

713
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:50.180
besides killing their own people.

714
00:16:50.181 --> 00:16:52.820
But what they do is they create these enormous craters,

715
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.490
craters of death that are filled with,

716
00:16:55.491 --> 00:16:55.790
with,

717
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:56.240
uh,

718
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:56.570
uh,

719
00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:58.990
just awful pestilent waters into and it,

720
00:16:58.991 --> 00:17:00.260
and make it impossible,

721
00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:00.830
uh,

722
00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.150
to really get to the other side.

723
00:17:02.151 --> 00:17:02.984
Because once you,

724
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.650
you know,

725
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:08.630
once somebody goes up and blows the whistle as a follow me and you jump out of

726
00:17:08.631 --> 00:17:09.464
the trenches,

727
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:11.720
you've got to carry 60 pounds,

728
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.700
60 pounds worth of equipment.

729
00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:18.200
Now that's a lot of equipment down into these things come through these craters.

730
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:20.810
And then what you do is you find these machine guns,

731
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.570
layers of them to aimed right low,

732
00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:24.920
and they just take you out,

733
00:17:24.921 --> 00:17:25.191
right?

734
00:17:25.191 --> 00:17:26.030
One or after another.

735
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.730
I have been in imperial war museum in London various times,

736
00:17:28.731 --> 00:17:29.530
and I just went to about,

737
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:29.960
uh,

738
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:30.920
six weeks again,

739
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.090
a go for the hell of it.

740
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:33.463
They made it,

741
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:34.521
they really,

742
00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:35.660
it's not as good as it used to be,

743
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.831
but there,

744
00:17:36.831 --> 00:17:39.020
but there used to be this one clip where,

745
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.440
uh,

746
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.191
you can see these,

747
00:17:40.191 --> 00:17:40.851
these guys,

748
00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:41.684
these three guys,

749
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:42.790
and one of them is a,

750
00:17:42.791 --> 00:17:43.521
in an officer.

751
00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:47.210
The officer has his whistle and he blows the whistle.

752
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:47.691
That is,

753
00:17:47.691 --> 00:17:48.190
you know,

754
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:48.741
on a ball.

755
00:17:48.741 --> 00:17:49.350
Here we,

756
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:50.183
let's go.

757
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:51.863
Let's go guys.

758
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.130
And you see him,

759
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.500
he gets one foot over there and he's shot dead.

760
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:57.870
So you see his body slumped down.

761
00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.580
You see the second guy,

762
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.740
you can imagine the terror in his eyes.

763
00:18:01.741 --> 00:18:02.730
You can't see him,

764
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:03.863
his eyes,

765
00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:04.470
uh,

766
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:05.370
you don't see him very long,

767
00:18:05.371 --> 00:18:06.690
cause then he's killed two.

768
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:11.340
And then you'll see the third guy get over and you don't know what happens to

769
00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:11.461
him.

770
00:18:11.461 --> 00:18:13.140
His eyes weren't very good.

771
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.770
Uh,

772
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:14.320
but,

773
00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:14.410
uh,

774
00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:14.761
this,

775
00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:16.350
this is a story of a,

776
00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.193
of the war.

777
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.440
Now there's a vigorous historical debate always.

778
00:18:19.441 --> 00:18:20.850
And did they know what they were doing?

779
00:18:20.851 --> 00:18:21.510
I mean,

780
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:24.360
there's the image that you will see of course in the movie,

781
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:25.111
uh,

782
00:18:25.111 --> 00:18:27.030
the paths of glory is that they're,

783
00:18:27.031 --> 00:18:28.230
they are drinking champagne.

784
00:18:28.231 --> 00:18:28.801
And somebody who's,

785
00:18:28.801 --> 00:18:29.240
uh,

786
00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:29.340
uh,

787
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.780
confiscated chateau,

788
00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:31.231
uh,

789
00:18:31.231 --> 00:18:35.010
and sending runners who were the people who carried messages to the,

790
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:35.921
to the,

791
00:18:35.921 --> 00:18:36.001
uh,

792
00:18:36.001 --> 00:18:36.834
trenches.

793
00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:37.530
Uh,

794
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:37.921
and,

795
00:18:37.921 --> 00:18:38.970
and our organizing.

796
00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.270
You're organizing these attacks and thus,

797
00:18:42.271 --> 00:18:42.481
you know,

798
00:18:42.481 --> 00:18:42.621
the,

799
00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:43.570
the most famous and,

800
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:44.910
you know,

801
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:49.080
just killing fields basically of the war.

802
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.920
And the really famous one was like posh Andale,

803
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:51.631
which is in,

804
00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:52.230
uh,

805
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:53.220
in Belgium.

806
00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:53.510
I,

807
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.210
and when you go through this idyllic sir,

808
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:56.480
part of Belgium near Eip,

809
00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:56.701
I mean,

810
00:18:56.701 --> 00:18:57.600
you can't imagine that,

811
00:18:57.601 --> 00:18:57.871
you know,

812
00:18:57.871 --> 00:19:00.300
tens of thousands of people dying there in a poison.

813
00:19:00.301 --> 00:19:02.490
That's where the Germans first use poison gas.

814
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.390
Um,

815
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.450
or the psalm is the obvious example that everybody uses.

816
00:19:06.451 --> 00:19:08.340
And I will use again in a while and,

817
00:19:08.341 --> 00:19:09.390
or the battle of El done,

818
00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:10.260
uh,

819
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:10.621
uh,

820
00:19:10.621 --> 00:19:11.011
where,

821
00:19:11.011 --> 00:19:11.221
you know,

822
00:19:11.221 --> 00:19:11.391
they're,

823
00:19:11.391 --> 00:19:13.350
you're fighting a hand to hand,

824
00:19:13.351 --> 00:19:16.050
hand to hand combat in the forts of Verdun,

825
00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:17.010
uh,

826
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:17.580
that,

827
00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:17.791
uh,

828
00:19:17.791 --> 00:19:21.570
and it goes simply goes on and on and on.

829
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.111
And there's,

830
00:19:22.111 --> 00:19:22.321
you know,

831
00:19:22.321 --> 00:19:23.240
now the revisionist,

832
00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.160
the interpretations of the battle of Passchendaele don't write down plush and

833
00:19:26.161 --> 00:19:26.401
Dale,

834
00:19:26.401 --> 00:19:28.260
it's impossible to spell anyway,

835
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.280
um,

836
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:29.830
that,

837
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:30.480
uh,

838
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:30.691
uh,

839
00:19:30.691 --> 00:19:31.141
that say,

840
00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:31.411
well,

841
00:19:31.411 --> 00:19:31.681
if they,

842
00:19:31.681 --> 00:19:35.490
if they'd redefine the idea of the creeping barrage and if they'd managed to

843
00:19:35.491 --> 00:19:36.450
just take a,

844
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:36.751
you know,

845
00:19:36.751 --> 00:19:39.270
a hundred yards and hold that and the next hundred yards,

846
00:19:39.271 --> 00:19:39.721
et cetera,

847
00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:40.380
et cetera.

848
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:40.800
But,

849
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.550
uh,

850
00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:42.390
increasingly,

851
00:19:42.391 --> 00:19:42.601
I mean,

852
00:19:42.601 --> 00:19:43.470
it was just clear.

853
00:19:43.471 --> 00:19:43.651
I mean,

854
00:19:43.651 --> 00:19:47.100
it was obviously the soldiers and it was clear to most anybody that there wasn't

855
00:19:47.101 --> 00:19:48.030
going to be a breakthrough.

856
00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:48.810
Uh,

857
00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:49.271
but the,

858
00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:49.421
the,

859
00:19:49.421 --> 00:19:50.200
the high command,

860
00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.220
the German high command and,

861
00:19:51.221 --> 00:19:52.620
and the French high command and,

862
00:19:52.621 --> 00:19:53.271
and the,

863
00:19:53.271 --> 00:19:54.180
the British high command,

864
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:54.571
uh,

865
00:19:54.571 --> 00:19:59.571
keep insisting that the next one will be the time we will truly break through.

866
00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:03.180
But there isn't any breakthrough until the Germans breakthrough in the spring of

867
00:20:03.181 --> 00:20:04.140
1918.

868
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.710
Uh,

869
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.780
and the bodies get higher and higher.

870
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:08.280
Now in the eastern front,

871
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.880
you know,

872
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.180
which,

873
00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.130
which you had some trench situations,

874
00:20:11.131 --> 00:20:11.851
but basically,

875
00:20:11.851 --> 00:20:12.031
you know,

876
00:20:12.031 --> 00:20:13.740
it's a more wide open kind of fighting.

877
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:14.460
Uh,

878
00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:15.120
you have,

879
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:15.391
uh,

880
00:20:15.391 --> 00:20:15.930
it was almost,

881
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.970
there's so many people killed that one of the Russian generalist disparities.

882
00:20:18.971 --> 00:20:21.840
So we don't have any idea how many people killed because a bottle of bodies just

883
00:20:21.841 --> 00:20:22.530
stack up so high.

884
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:23.430
We can't see anything.

885
00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:23.820
And we,

886
00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:28.820
it's impossible to guests in and the Italian front and the Italian and Austrian

887
00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:30.210
Front Austro-hungarian Front,

888
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:34.350
there are 10 different battles named after the same river,

889
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.820
the same small river.

890
00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.860
And so real estate is exchanged,

891
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.550
uh,

892
00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:39.690
in terms of,

893
00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:40.280
of,

894
00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.280
of yards,

895
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:45.330
not in terms of it's won or lost at the expense of all these lives,

896
00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:46.080
uh,

897
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.940
a of not kilometers.

898
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:49.421
Uh,

899
00:20:49.421 --> 00:20:49.900
but,

900
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:50.120
uh,

901
00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:50.370
but,

902
00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:51.730
but yards in kilometers,

903
00:20:51.731 --> 00:20:54.010
gains of a couple of kilometers are,

904
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:55.061
are,

905
00:20:55.061 --> 00:20:55.450
uh,

906
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:56.740
celebrated by,

907
00:20:56.741 --> 00:20:57.280
uh,

908
00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:57.790
uh,

909
00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.830
by the hysterical press.

910
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:00.560
Uh,

911
00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:00.751
I,

912
00:21:00.751 --> 00:21:03.010
I'm both sides and I mean,

913
00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:03.940
these are very old stories,

914
00:21:03.941 --> 00:21:04.611
but it's still true.

915
00:21:04.611 --> 00:21:05.100
I mean the,

916
00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:05.891
that things appeared,

917
00:21:05.891 --> 00:21:06.281
for example,

918
00:21:06.281 --> 00:21:06.971
in the French press,

919
00:21:06.971 --> 00:21:07.161
Heather,

920
00:21:07.161 --> 00:21:08.350
their counterparts elsewhere,

921
00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:09.160
uh,

922
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:09.641
that,

923
00:21:09.641 --> 00:21:10.060
uh,

924
00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:10.391
uh,

925
00:21:10.391 --> 00:21:14.260
French bodies that are decomposing don't smell the way German bodies,

926
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.010
uh,

927
00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:15.490
uh,

928
00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:16.480
that are decomposing.

929
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:19.450
That was a one story or that the German,

930
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:19.721
uh,

931
00:21:19.721 --> 00:21:21.820
shells are so badly made.

932
00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:23.590
The expression was Jerry made.

933
00:21:23.591 --> 00:21:27.250
That is an expression that that came out of World War Two also made by the

934
00:21:27.251 --> 00:21:30.250
Germans because Jerry's was a derogative term for Germans,

935
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:31.600
that they're just kind of like,

936
00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:31.961
you know,

937
00:21:31.961 --> 00:21:32.850
play things.

938
00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.120
They just kind of blow up and go poof.

939
00:21:34.121 --> 00:21:34.954
And that's the end of it.

940
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.330
That they don't really kill a and reports,

941
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:37.760
uh,

942
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:38.050
uh,

943
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:39.370
put in the civilian press about,

944
00:21:39.371 --> 00:21:43.240
about the hardy vigorous life of the soldiers because they're in such good

945
00:21:43.241 --> 00:21:43.920
shape,

946
00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.110
you know,

947
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.980
cause they're eating well,

948
00:21:44.981 --> 00:21:46.060
which is obviously not the case.

949
00:21:46.061 --> 00:21:47.410
They're eating frozen potatoes.

950
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:48.190
Uh,

951
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:49.023
and when the,

952
00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:49.421
you know,

953
00:21:49.421 --> 00:21:51.490
Pete town increases the rum ration,

954
00:21:51.491 --> 00:21:52.570
so they could go over the top,

955
00:21:52.571 --> 00:21:53.140
a little,

956
00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.520
a little tipsy to get killed,

957
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:55.120
uh,

958
00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:55.620
in,

959
00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:56.210
uh,

960
00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:57.430
in a val done,

961
00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:57.821
uh,

962
00:21:57.821 --> 00:21:59.260
in 1916.

963
00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:00.040
Um,

964
00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.570
so there was this enormous,

965
00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:03.640
and this is one of the themes in the literature of the war.

966
00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.020
This is huge discontinuity between the civilian life,

967
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.500
uh,

968
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.800
and the soldiers and the soldiers can't talk about it when they come back.

969
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:12.700
Uh,

970
00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:13.151
you know,

971
00:22:13.151 --> 00:22:14.380
and they say things like,

972
00:22:14.381 --> 00:22:14.830
uh,

973
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:17.200
what do they imagine that we jump up every morning and say,

974
00:22:17.201 --> 00:22:18.100
long live France,

975
00:22:18.101 --> 00:22:18.911
long live Germany,

976
00:22:18.911 --> 00:22:19.990
long live Italy,

977
00:22:19.991 --> 00:22:22.810
depending on your case and jump over the top heroically.

978
00:22:22.811 --> 00:22:23.160
Uh,

979
00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:23.740
you know,

980
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.380
in order to get to a,

981
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:26.171
your name the city,

982
00:22:26.171 --> 00:22:26.651
Moscow,

983
00:22:26.651 --> 00:22:27.420
Berlin,

984
00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:27.970
uh,

985
00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:28.090
uh,

986
00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:28.840
Paris,

987
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.230
uh,

988
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:30.063
San [inaudible],

989
00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.570
wherever you want to talk about it.

990
00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:32.410
Um,

991
00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:32.710
the,

992
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:33.401
and so this,

993
00:22:33.401 --> 00:22:34.091
this continuity,

994
00:22:34.091 --> 00:22:35.500
the soldiers when they go on and leave,

995
00:22:35.501 --> 00:22:35.771
when that,

996
00:22:35.771 --> 00:22:38.030
when the soldiers go back to the whorehouses of Mamacita,

997
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:38.770
uh,

998
00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:39.280
you know,

999
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:39.580
uh,

1000
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:39.971
they,

1001
00:22:39.971 --> 00:22:40.540
um,

1002
00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:40.721
uh,

1003
00:22:40.721 --> 00:22:41.461
or the bars of,

1004
00:22:41.461 --> 00:22:41.611
of,

1005
00:22:41.611 --> 00:22:43.210
of Montparnasse or anywhere else,

1006
00:22:43.211 --> 00:22:44.110
or back to their,

1007
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.700
uh,

1008
00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:45.533
Doug Leone.

1009
00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:46.780
And or anywhere you want,

1010
00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:50.470
it's impossible for them to even discuss what has happened.

1011
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.831
And indeed,

1012
00:22:50.831 --> 00:22:53.590
one of the interesting things about this whole thing is lots of the really great

1013
00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.970
literature after the war about the war does not come in the first two years.

1014
00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:58.900
Uh,

1015
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.190
the Bob boosts,

1016
00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:00.911
does that mean,

1017
00:23:00.911 --> 00:23:01.390
that's fact?

1018
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:02.370
I think he started to,

1019
00:23:02.371 --> 00:23:02.801
you know,

1020
00:23:02.801 --> 00:23:03.634
in the war,

1021
00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:04.170
but,

1022
00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:04.291
uh,

1023
00:23:04.291 --> 00:23:08.380
all quiet on the western front isn't really written until late in the 1920s.

1024
00:23:08.381 --> 00:23:08.921
And then of course,

1025
00:23:08.921 --> 00:23:09.340
the,

1026
00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.910
the Nazis tried to keep it from being shown because it's obviously an antiwar

1027
00:23:12.911 --> 00:23:13.744
film,

1028
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:14.230
uh,

1029
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.710
in,

1030
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:15.360
uh,

1031
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.000
um,

1032
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:16.600
in,

1033
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:16.901
uh,

1034
00:23:16.901 --> 00:23:17.690
German,

1035
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:17.920
uh,

1036
00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:18.730
theaters.

1037
00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:19.271
So,

1038
00:23:19.271 --> 00:23:19.750
um,

1039
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:20.441
well in terms of,

1040
00:23:20.441 --> 00:23:20.591
you know,

1041
00:23:20.591 --> 00:23:21.640
in 1914,

1042
00:23:21.641 --> 00:23:21.821
I mean,

1043
00:23:21.821 --> 00:23:23.020
you could just see statistics,

1044
00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:26.560
you can just give all these statistics and you can read charts in any book,

1045
00:23:26.561 --> 00:23:27.380
including mine.

1046
00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:28.360
And it's just,

1047
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:29.320
these are real people,

1048
00:23:29.321 --> 00:23:29.981
which is very hard.

1049
00:23:29.981 --> 00:23:30.731
It's obvious thing to say,

1050
00:23:30.731 --> 00:23:31.180
but it's hard.

1051
00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:31.510
It's hard.

1052
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:32.770
It just is the singer,

1053
00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.700
his fingers are so numbing by the end of the,

1054
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:37.180
of 1914.

1055
00:23:37.181 --> 00:23:38.620
So you're talking about half a year.

1056
00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:39.400
Um,

1057
00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.233
the British,

1058
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:41.020
I mean,

1059
00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:45.680
the German and French forces had combined casualties of 300,000 killed.

1060
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:50.710
That's three times the number of people filling up the La Coliseum or the rose

1061
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.010
bowl or Michigan stadium.

1062
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.060
That's a lot of people,

1063
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.580
600,000 wounded.

1064
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.630
Um,

1065
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:57.210
and,

1066
00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:57.630
uh,

1067
00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.080
and these are many in many cases,

1068
00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:00.470
just devastating wounds.

1069
00:24:00.471 --> 00:24:02.780
And so it's not so hard to imagine why,

1070
00:24:02.781 --> 00:24:02.931
you know,

1071
00:24:02.931 --> 00:24:04.040
the Paris metro in the,

1072
00:24:04.041 --> 00:24:04.620
in the,

1073
00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:04.700
uh,

1074
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.390
the subway in the 1920s was full of people begging with one arm or one,

1075
00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:12.750
one leg or no legs or coughing out their lungs because of gas attacked.

1076
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:13.753
Um,

1077
00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:17.690
the British seventh division arrived in France in October,

1078
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:22.570
1914 with 400 officers and 12,000 soldiers after fighting around IPA,

1079
00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.040
which IPA has right over the Belgian border,

1080
00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:25.850
uh,

1081
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:26.840
up by the English,

1082
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:28.310
not far with an English Channel,

1083
00:24:28.311 --> 00:24:29.720
beautiful old textile town.

1084
00:24:29.721 --> 00:24:31.910
It was destroyed for obvious reasons during the war.

1085
00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.093
Um,

1086
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.530
they had 400 officers and 12,000 soldiers,

1087
00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:37.970
400 officers,

1088
00:24:37.971 --> 00:24:40.250
12th thousand soldiers at the end.

1089
00:24:40.251 --> 00:24:41.390
After 18 days,

1090
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:45.140
they had 44 officers and 2000,

1091
00:24:45.141 --> 00:24:48.140
336 soldiers left.

1092
00:24:48.141 --> 00:24:50.100
Figuring out your odds if you're able.

1093
00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:50.370
We're 18,

1094
00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:50.761
<v 0>19,</v>

1095
00:24:50.761 --> 00:24:51.061
20,

1096
00:24:51.061 --> 00:24:51.894
21,

1097
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:52.710
uh,

1098
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:53.640
male in,

1099
00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:54.121
uh,

1100
00:24:54.121 --> 00:24:54.930
19,

1101
00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:55.320
uh,

1102
00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.153
19,

1103
00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:56.760
uh,

1104
00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.630
14.

1105
00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.370
And there's a recent movie which I,

1106
00:24:59.371 --> 00:25:01.050
I can't remember the name of it,

1107
00:25:01.051 --> 00:25:01.641
my wife was saying,

1108
00:25:01.641 --> 00:25:02.310
but it is,

1109
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:03.060
but it's about,

1110
00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:03.690
uh,

1111
00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:03.901
I,

1112
00:25:03.901 --> 00:25:04.561
in 19,

1113
00:25:04.561 --> 00:25:04.650
uh,

1114
00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:05.610
14,

1115
00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:06.181
uh,

1116
00:25:06.181 --> 00:25:10.030
there was an attempt on Christmas day for people to say that's the fee large

1117
00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:10.530
mall.

1118
00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:10.741
I mean,

1119
00:25:10.741 --> 00:25:12.090
this is just enough of this crap.

1120
00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.280
Let's sing to each other.

1121
00:25:14.281 --> 00:25:17.430
In the Welsh were singing their ballads and the Germans were singing,

1122
00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.230
uh,

1123
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.571
you know,

1124
00:25:18.571 --> 00:25:20.330
doleful Lutheran hymns and the,

1125
00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.320
and the Catholic friends were singing,

1126
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:22.890
you know,

1127
00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:23.910
this and that and,

1128
00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:24.890
and uh,

1129
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:25.740
then,

1130
00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:26.460
um,

1131
00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:27.290
uh,

1132
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:27.530
you know,

1133
00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:28.051
somebody said,

1134
00:25:28.051 --> 00:25:28.141
well,

1135
00:25:28.141 --> 00:25:28.470
let's play,

1136
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:29.490
let's play some football.

1137
00:25:29.491 --> 00:25:30.330
So they got to,

1138
00:25:30.331 --> 00:25:30.541
you know,

1139
00:25:30.541 --> 00:25:34.080
I've got soccer players and they out playing and kicking the ball around and

1140
00:25:34.081 --> 00:25:35.910
they went back to try to kill each other again.

1141
00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:37.530
In 1915,

1142
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:38.280
um,

1143
00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.810
a British soldier suggested said,

1144
00:25:39.811 --> 00:25:40.051
hey,

1145
00:25:40.051 --> 00:25:41.160
let's do that again.

1146
00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.250
Cause he was lucky enough to be around when they're doing it in 1914,

1147
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:46.980
they put him up against the wall and shot him for treason,

1148
00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:47.843
treason.

1149
00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:49.680
And one of the things that happens during this,

1150
00:25:49.681 --> 00:25:50.850
because these people were,

1151
00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:52.140
everybody knows all these stories.

1152
00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:52.910
You know,

1153
00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:53.101
the,

1154
00:25:53.101 --> 00:25:53.250
the,

1155
00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:54.750
I mean you hear people dying,

1156
00:25:54.751 --> 00:25:56.490
you hear them slowly expire.

1157
00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:57.790
I between uh,

1158
00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:58.441
uh,

1159
00:25:58.441 --> 00:25:58.681
you know,

1160
00:25:58.681 --> 00:26:00.930
in the craters between the trenches.

1161
00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.370
And so there are all these rumors that,

1162
00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:07.170
that there were all these people that had managed to survive with light wounds

1163
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:09.660
and that there was this huge underground,

1164
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:14.950
a cavern were Germans and French and British were all hanging out and they were

1165
00:26:15.151 --> 00:26:18.510
going out and getting wine champagne where they could find it and they were

1166
00:26:18.511 --> 00:26:22.800
coming and taking food rations and they were the smart ones cause they were down

1167
00:26:22.801 --> 00:26:23.580
there.

1168
00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:24.090
Uh,

1169
00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:24.751
and you know,

1170
00:26:24.751 --> 00:26:27.300
it was the kind of rumor that just went on and on,

1171
00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:30.690
but the proximity of death and proximity of the war was Wa was,

1172
00:26:30.691 --> 00:26:31.560
was always there.

1173
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:32.400
Again,

1174
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.760
the another famous example you could have if you're,

1175
00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:34.950
you know,

1176
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:36.450
an officer in the British army,

1177
00:26:36.451 --> 00:26:39.930
you could have lunch in the officer's Club at Victoria Station where many of you

1178
00:26:39.931 --> 00:26:40.764
have been,

1179
00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:44.070
and you could take the train to the front and you could be dead

1180
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.030
<v 1>by,</v>

1181
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:45.390
ah,

1182
00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:46.230
in the same front.

1183
00:26:46.231 --> 00:26:48.990
You could be dead Co Fini uh,

1184
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.430
Covey by,

1185
00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:51.120
uh,

1186
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.320
by the end of the day,

1187
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.310
uh,

1188
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:54.720
when Welsh minors,

1189
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:55.230
uh,

1190
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:58.020
tunneled under this big promitory in Belgium,

1191
00:26:58.021 --> 00:27:01.770
the explosion could be heard across the English Channel in Kent.

1192
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:03.270
The war was so close.

1193
00:27:03.271 --> 00:27:04.770
That's what made it terrifying.

1194
00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:07.980
But that's what makes it also because of the people lost,

1195
00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:08.720
people,

1196
00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:09.690
lost family,

1197
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.160
everybody lost family.

1198
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:14.970
That war was the dominant experience of,

1199
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:15.730
uh,

1200
00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:16.291
of,

1201
00:27:16.291 --> 00:27:17.550
of the 20th century,

1202
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:20.100
at least the first half of the 20th century.

1203
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:20.941
And again,

1204
00:27:20.941 --> 00:27:21.940
you can look at the whole period,

1205
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:26.460
1914 to 1945 as this long,

1206
00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:27.300
horrible,

1207
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:32.040
30 years' war because the soldiers just simply kept,

1208
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:33.300
kept marching.

1209
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:34.530
Uh,

1210
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:37.110
but they weren't doing much marching in the trenches.

1211
00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:37.500
Uh,

1212
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.220
because,

1213
00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:38.520
uh,

1214
00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.240
there was,

1215
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.620
there wasn't any word to go,

1216
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.160
uh,

1217
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.430
you're marching was running out and hoping that you were somehow going to make

1218
00:27:44.431 --> 00:27:45.120
it back,

1219
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:45.710
uh,

1220
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.930
uh,

1221
00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.580
after yet another,

1222
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:48.000
uh,

1223
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.410
let's go over,

1224
00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:49.601
uh,

1225
00:27:49.601 --> 00:27:50.091
over the,

1226
00:27:50.091 --> 00:27:50.924
the top.

1227
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:51.271
Uh,

1228
00:27:51.271 --> 00:27:52.110
and to repeat,

1229
00:27:52.111 --> 00:27:52.380
I mean,

1230
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.030
machineguns had first been used,

1231
00:27:54.031 --> 00:27:54.841
if I remember right,

1232
00:27:54.841 --> 00:27:57.390
they were called Gatling guns in the American civil war.

1233
00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.040
I think they were used at Gettysburg,

1234
00:27:59.070 --> 00:27:59.940
if I'm correct.

1235
00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:00.960
Um,

1236
00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.760
they were slowly perfected,

1237
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:03.271
uh,

1238
00:28:03.271 --> 00:28:05.130
at least to the level of world war one.

1239
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:05.971
And they,

1240
00:28:05.971 --> 00:28:08.820
after shelling after these big shells,

1241
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:09.410
uh,

1242
00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:09.600
uh,

1243
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.201
launching,

1244
00:28:10.201 --> 00:28:10.620
you know,

1245
00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.480
tens of thousands of shells,

1246
00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.080
you know,

1247
00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.260
when they're softening up the opponent as to where they're going to go.

1248
00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:16.411
I mean,

1249
00:28:16.411 --> 00:28:16.741
these,

1250
00:28:16.741 --> 00:28:19.770
these things go on for days and that's where the whole,

1251
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:23.880
the whole syndrome of shell shock is a term that comes out of world war one too.

1252
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.170
Because a lot of people,

1253
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:25.651
something,

1254
00:28:25.651 --> 00:28:25.801
I mean,

1255
00:28:25.801 --> 00:28:28.420
there are all sorts of estimates on how many people really lost,

1256
00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:29.290
uh,

1257
00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:32.160
lost their mental capacity because of all of this.

1258
00:28:32.161 --> 00:28:32.401
But,

1259
00:28:32.401 --> 00:28:34.200
but not only new ways of dying,

1260
00:28:34.201 --> 00:28:38.160
but new ways of just having your head exploding time and time and time again,

1261
00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.590
a living among the dead bodies,

1262
00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:41.160
uh,

1263
00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:41.341
uh,

1264
00:28:41.341 --> 00:28:42.810
comrades who have disappeared,

1265
00:28:42.811 --> 00:28:43.471
a rat's,

1266
00:28:43.471 --> 00:28:44.370
huge rats,

1267
00:28:44.371 --> 00:28:46.170
huge aggressive rats,

1268
00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:47.243
mice,

1269
00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.200
Weiss and everything else.

1270
00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.310
And then there were,

1271
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:51.323
uh,

1272
00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:51.900
you know,

1273
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.850
there were a flame throwers and their tanks,

1274
00:28:53.851 --> 00:28:54.720
more about tanks.

1275
00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.410
Uh,

1276
00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:55.890
uh,

1277
00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:56.530
tanks are,

1278
00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:57.450
aren't any good at all,

1279
00:28:57.451 --> 00:28:59.820
basically till 1917 because you had a tank,

1280
00:28:59.821 --> 00:29:00.300
no matter,

1281
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.190
no tank can go over these craters.

1282
00:29:02.191 --> 00:29:04.080
They just get stuck in there or whatever.

1283
00:29:04.081 --> 00:29:04.831
Then that's their wheels.

1284
00:29:04.831 --> 00:29:05.401
I don't know what you call them.

1285
00:29:05.401 --> 00:29:05.941
They're treads,

1286
00:29:05.941 --> 00:29:07.590
just spin around and,

1287
00:29:07.591 --> 00:29:07.801
and,

1288
00:29:07.801 --> 00:29:08.430
and,

1289
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:09.300
and they're,

1290
00:29:09.301 --> 00:29:10.134
they are.

1291
00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:10.950
Um,

1292
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:11.731
and so,

1293
00:29:11.731 --> 00:29:12.564
um,

1294
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:14.791
there were,

1295
00:29:14.791 --> 00:29:15.121
uh,

1296
00:29:15.121 --> 00:29:15.960
there was new,

1297
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.960
uh,

1298
00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.480
a new misery.

1299
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:19.201
Uh,

1300
00:29:19.201 --> 00:29:19.591
and I did,

1301
00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:19.861
you know,

1302
00:29:19.861 --> 00:29:21.180
you could send packages,

1303
00:29:21.181 --> 00:29:22.770
a little care packages to,

1304
00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:26.240
to the soldiers with the little cheese from the owl Dasher,

1305
00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:27.093
little sub,

1306
00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:31.650
a cheese from Savoie or maybe a bottle of wine from burgundy or something like

1307
00:29:31.651 --> 00:29:33.240
that and hopes it didn't get pilfered.

1308
00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.150
One soldier wrote back before you can have a drink.

1309
00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:37.830
You have to chip away the ice.

1310
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:39.420
The meat is frozen and solid.

1311
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:44.410
The potatoes are bonded by and even hand grenades are welded together and their

1312
00:29:44.411 --> 00:29:44.831
cases.

1313
00:29:44.831 --> 00:29:46.350
That's another weapon to that that,

1314
00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:46.990
uh,

1315
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:47.620
comes up.

1316
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:48.090
Uh,

1317
00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:48.490
um,

1318
00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:51.370
in World War World War One,

1319
00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:51.960
a friend,

1320
00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:52.371
soldier,

1321
00:29:52.371 --> 00:29:54.040
remember we all had honest,

1322
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.200
the stench of dead bodies,

1323
00:29:56.201 --> 00:29:57.220
the bread we ate,

1324
00:29:57.221 --> 00:29:58.780
the stagnant water we drank.

1325
00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:00.760
Everything we touched had,

1326
00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:01.390
uh,

1327
00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:02.590
a rotten smell.

1328
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:04.510
Death simply numbed,

1329
00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:05.131
uh,

1330
00:30:05.131 --> 00:30:06.430
an Austrian soldier of,

1331
00:30:06.431 --> 00:30:07.840
here's some examples I took from other,

1332
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:08.801
other front too,

1333
00:30:08.801 --> 00:30:10.360
but why not a violinist?

1334
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.630
A violinist wrote a certain fierceness arises in you,

1335
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.560
an absolute indifference to anything the world holds except your duty of

1336
00:30:17.561 --> 00:30:18.394
fighting.

1337
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:22.810
You're eating across the brand and a man is shot dead in the trench next to you.

1338
00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:24.700
You look at them calmly for a moment,

1339
00:30:24.701 --> 00:30:26.260
and then you go on eating your bread.

1340
00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:27.483
Why not?

1341
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.720
There's nothing to be done.

1342
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.260
And Yeah,

1343
00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.250
after having an affair,

1344
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:30.821
I,

1345
00:30:30.821 --> 00:30:31.391
in the end,

1346
00:30:31.391 --> 00:30:36.391
you talk of your own death with as little excitement as you would as a a

1347
00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:37.600
luncheon engagement,

1348
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.690
a British,

1349
00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:38.831
uh,

1350
00:30:38.831 --> 00:30:40.030
one of the war poets road.

1351
00:30:40.031 --> 00:30:41.230
I can't remember which one,

1352
00:30:41.231 --> 00:30:42.520
but the line sticks with you.

1353
00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:43.480
He wrote,

1354
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.750
I didn't want to die at least anyway,

1355
00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:46.531
until I'd finished.

1356
00:30:46.531 --> 00:30:50.350
We are reading the return of the native and then he went on a,

1357
00:30:50.351 --> 00:30:52.750
and the dead filled up these,

1358
00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:53.200
uh,

1359
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.070
these craters

1360
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:58.450
airplanes just as the insertion as they said,

1361
00:30:58.451 --> 00:30:59.590
were first used for Rocana,

1362
00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:00.610
Rocana sauce.

1363
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:01.580
Uh,

1364
00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:01.860
they,

1365
00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:02.141
they,

1366
00:31:02.141 --> 00:31:02.590
you know,

1367
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:05.020
the pilot's carry pistols and fire up their,

1368
00:31:05.021 --> 00:31:05.291
you know,

1369
00:31:05.291 --> 00:31:05.651
their,

1370
00:31:05.651 --> 00:31:06.130
uh,

1371
00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:06.670
uh,

1372
00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:08.410
their opponents.

1373
00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.071
And again,

1374
00:31:09.071 --> 00:31:10.570
there was a server spree decor that,

1375
00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:10.871
that,

1376
00:31:10.871 --> 00:31:11.400
uh,

1377
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.080
uh,

1378
00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:12.260
uh,

1379
00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:16.300
these were some of the brave fighting guys up there providing amusements for the

1380
00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:17.620
people in the trenches below.

1381
00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:19.720
And when one of the aces would get shot down,

1382
00:31:19.721 --> 00:31:24.580
the other planes would fly over and drop flowers and a baron von Rick coffin.

1383
00:31:24.581 --> 00:31:24.741
And,

1384
00:31:24.741 --> 00:31:24.991
and,

1385
00:31:24.991 --> 00:31:25.824
and all these,

1386
00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:26.080
you know,

1387
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.130
big ace guys,

1388
00:31:27.131 --> 00:31:28.660
most of whom were killed,

1389
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:29.021
uh,

1390
00:31:29.021 --> 00:31:29.201
in,

1391
00:31:29.201 --> 00:31:30.034
in the end,

1392
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:30.670
uh,

1393
00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:30.821
uh,

1394
00:31:30.821 --> 00:31:34.300
they get the good idea of instead of putting machine gun on a plane that fires,

1395
00:31:34.301 --> 00:31:37.960
and then they found that the machine gun bullets are sent back killing the pilot

1396
00:31:37.961 --> 00:31:38.800
by the propeller.

1397
00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:39.461
Someone says,

1398
00:31:39.461 --> 00:31:39.821
Aha,

1399
00:31:39.821 --> 00:31:41.260
let's time it to the propeller.

1400
00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.880
So they create ways,

1401
00:31:42.881 --> 00:31:45.250
they create bigger bombs that you can drop in all of that.

1402
00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:45.671
Uh,

1403
00:31:45.671 --> 00:31:46.090
but,

1404
00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:46.301
uh,

1405
00:31:46.301 --> 00:31:48.610
air force planes are basically used for,

1406
00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:49.570
uh,

1407
00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:50.190
for,

1408
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:50.680
uh,

1409
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.690
reconnaissance planes.

1410
00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:55.840
And the war simply goes on and on.

1411
00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:58.150
One of the reasons why it goes on and on by the way,

1412
00:31:58.151 --> 00:31:58.560
is,

1413
00:31:58.560 --> 00:31:59.170
um,

1414
00:31:59.170 --> 00:31:59.591
uh,

1415
00:31:59.591 --> 00:32:00.080
you know,

1416
00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.720
that atrocity stories.

1417
00:32:01.721 --> 00:32:02.080
I'm,

1418
00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:02.530
I mean,

1419
00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:03.970
that's not one reason that goes on and on,

1420
00:32:03.971 --> 00:32:06.490
but it's one of the things that that sort of wood would,

1421
00:32:06.491 --> 00:32:07.690
if you're going over the top again,

1422
00:32:07.691 --> 00:32:09.790
would give you some reason to want to go over the top,

1423
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:10.330
uh,

1424
00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:11.890
besides simply trying to survive.

1425
00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:15.670
And not wanting to be shot as a dessert or is the atrocity stories,

1426
00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:16.151
uh,

1427
00:32:16.151 --> 00:32:19.870
of course for the Germans who had in the Franco Prussian war,

1428
00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:21.370
there were some cases,

1429
00:32:21.371 --> 00:32:25.720
not very many of them being gunned down by civilians who were called

1430
00:32:25.721 --> 00:32:26.554
[inaudible],

1431
00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.600
just civilian sort of sharp shooters.

1432
00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:29.410
Um,

1433
00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:32.740
and the Germans go into the war with the sense that they better watch it cause

1434
00:32:32.741 --> 00:32:33.574
the Belgians are gonna,

1435
00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:33.821
you know,

1436
00:32:33.821 --> 00:32:35.440
are going to shoot you down from buildings.

1437
00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:36.070
Uh,

1438
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:37.180
and so will the French.

1439
00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:37.540
Uh,

1440
00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:38.860
most of the atrocities,

1441
00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:39.120
uh,

1442
00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.420
the western front were committed by the Germans,

1443
00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.860
not by the French.

1444
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:43.221
Uh,

1445
00:32:43.221 --> 00:32:43.970
there were,

1446
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:44.271
uh,

1447
00:32:44.271 --> 00:32:45.104
at 500,

1448
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.440
a Belgian civilians executed most famously the,

1449
00:32:48.441 --> 00:32:48.980
uh,

1450
00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:50.490
the nurse Adita Cavalla,

1451
00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.000
uh,

1452
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.380
who is executed with a couple of other people accused of,

1453
00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.393
of treasons.

1454
00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:56.700
Uh,

1455
00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.180
there were cases of rape perpetuated by,

1456
00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:00.050
uh,

1457
00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:00.680
uh,

1458
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:01.101
by,

1459
00:33:01.101 --> 00:33:01.390
uh,

1460
00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:02.121
a germ of truth,

1461
00:33:02.121 --> 00:33:04.550
but rape had not yet become a weapon of war.

1462
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.840
I that would lay wait until,

1463
00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:07.250
uh,

1464
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:08.083
later in,

1465
00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:10.280
in that very sad,

1466
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:11.683
very sad,

1467
00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:12.410
uh,

1468
00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:13.243
century.

1469
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:13.910
Uh,

1470
00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:14.930
but these,

1471
00:33:14.931 --> 00:33:15.501
these,

1472
00:33:15.501 --> 00:33:16.334
um,

1473
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:16.791
you know,

1474
00:33:16.791 --> 00:33:17.624
these stories,

1475
00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:18.020
you know,

1476
00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:21.830
passed very quickly and were seized upon by propagandas on both sides.

1477
00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:23.780
And that sort of keeps folks going.

1478
00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:24.351
Okay.

1479
00:33:24.351 --> 00:33:25.184
Now what about,

1480
00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:26.863
what about Vr done?

1481
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:27.650
Can we,

1482
00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:29.720
how do I cut this completely?

1483
00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:30.501
Cause they're not gonna be,

1484
00:33:30.501 --> 00:33:31.220
we'll see this.

1485
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:31.410
Well,

1486
00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:32.900
just have to pretend you're fighting at night.

1487
00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:34.123
Maybe that,

1488
00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:35.480
can you,

1489
00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.110
can you,

1490
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:37.790
can we fool around with that thing?

1491
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:38.833
Thanks a lot.

1492
00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:39.621
I appreciate it.

1493
00:33:39.621 --> 00:33:41.120
I'm not very good at that sort of high,

1494
00:33:41.121 --> 00:33:42.050
high tech stuff.

1495
00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:43.940
Now we can pretend we're finding it day.

1496
00:33:43.941 --> 00:33:44.750
There we go.

1497
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:45.440
Anyway.

1498
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:45.890
Uh,

1499
00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:47.160
this is from valve done Novell.

1500
00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:51.020
Then why did the Germans go after avail done in 1916?

1501
00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:51.620
Uh,

1502
00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.360
they know they're not going to break through,

1503
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:54.141
but again,

1504
00:33:54.141 --> 00:33:56.270
it has ultimately to do with,

1505
00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:56.720
uh,

1506
00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.740
that um,

1507
00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:57.891
uh,

1508
00:33:57.891 --> 00:34:02.891
French birthrate is that they know because they have more children.

1509
00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:06.950
They can afford to lose more German soldiers.

1510
00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:08.630
That is,

1511
00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:09.530
if you were in German,

1512
00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:10.813
you guys,

1513
00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.890
then the French,

1514
00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.260
that is you guys or the British,

1515
00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:15.831
you guys,

1516
00:34:15.831 --> 00:34:18.920
if you were French or you were a British.

1517
00:34:18.921 --> 00:34:19.701
And by the way to say,

1518
00:34:19.701 --> 00:34:20.091
guys,

1519
00:34:20.091 --> 00:34:20.541
it's not the,

1520
00:34:20.541 --> 00:34:22.870
it's not at all to denigrate the role of women in the war.

1521
00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.340
More about that next lecture to a great extent,

1522
00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:26.570
a great extent,

1523
00:34:26.571 --> 00:34:28.880
because that's extremely important because somebody had to step up in the

1524
00:34:28.881 --> 00:34:29.960
factories and all of that.

1525
00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:30.590
Uh,

1526
00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:32.420
but they general Faulk and Hein,

1527
00:34:32.421 --> 00:34:33.260
the commander,

1528
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:33.800
uh,

1529
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:38.800
simply says we will bleed them so that they will be forced to negotiate and to

1530
00:34:39.531 --> 00:34:40.520
sue for peace.

1531
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:45.350
They cannot afford to lose all of the hundred thousands of people that we can

1532
00:34:45.351 --> 00:34:46.310
afford to lose.

1533
00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:47.370
So,

1534
00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:47.581
uh,

1535
00:34:47.581 --> 00:34:48.710
at the battle of El done,

1536
00:34:48.711 --> 00:34:51.360
the town of Vail de in the moves in northeast,

1537
00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:51.681
you know,

1538
00:34:51.681 --> 00:34:52.080
from,

1539
00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:52.490
uh,

1540
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:52.611
uh,

1541
00:34:52.611 --> 00:34:53.444
from maps,

1542
00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:53.811
uh,

1543
00:34:53.811 --> 00:34:54.471
itself has,

1544
00:34:54.471 --> 00:34:54.711
was,

1545
00:34:54.711 --> 00:34:57.140
has been virtually destroyed by,

1546
00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:57.770
uh,

1547
00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:58.640
by shelling,

1548
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:59.300
uh,

1549
00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.700
and the forts avail down or off to the north end,

1550
00:35:01.701 --> 00:35:02.240
to the east.

1551
00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.073
And they're two of them.

1552
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.160
The names don't matter,

1553
00:35:04.161 --> 00:35:04.821
but they're interesting.

1554
00:35:04.821 --> 00:35:06.260
And some day you should go there.

1555
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:07.330
A vote.

1556
00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:08.870
A U X is one,

1557
00:35:08.871 --> 00:35:10.250
and the other is called Dewa Mall,

1558
00:35:10.251 --> 00:35:13.600
which may be the only French commune that no longer exists.

1559
00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:14.230
Do you do a mole?

1560
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:16.400
Should be di do di,

1561
00:35:16.401 --> 00:35:17.720
you know,

1562
00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.471
I can't remember.

1563
00:35:18.471 --> 00:35:20.960
D O u a m e n T.

1564
00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:21.411
Anyway,

1565
00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:22.160
it doesn't matter.

1566
00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.330
But one of the things when I,

1567
00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.141
when you go there,

1568
00:35:24.141 --> 00:35:26.570
you'll see these plaques that people put up after the war.

1569
00:35:26.571 --> 00:35:29.960
And I think I mentioned this the very first day and the hardest to take his is,

1570
00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:30.260
uh,

1571
00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.940
one guy advo he went up,

1572
00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.460
made a in 21 or 22 of plaque assist to my,

1573
00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:34.941
uh,

1574
00:35:34.941 --> 00:35:36.710
to my sons since his eyes closed,

1575
00:35:36.711 --> 00:35:38.100
might have not ceased to,

1576
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:38.933
<v 0>to weep.</v>

1577
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:43.410
And so the fighting in the myths of these forests with some of the worst ever

1578
00:35:43.411 --> 00:35:47.520
seen in any war and would take hundreds of thousands of lives.

1579
00:35:47.521 --> 00:35:48.270
As you know,

1580
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:50.310
this is a member of the stuff about the craters.

1581
00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:54.150
This is an aerial view of fort do 'em all,

1582
00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:54.810
uh,

1583
00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:56.880
the area around there and those are all creators.

1584
00:35:56.881 --> 00:35:58.140
It looks like it's your classic,

1585
00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.000
a lunar landscape.

1586
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:03.360
This is the south entrance to the Fort of Dua Mall,

1587
00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:04.050
uh,

1588
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:06.180
which has just been destroyed by,

1589
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:06.840
uh,

1590
00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:08.550
by German shelling,

1591
00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:09.570
as you can see.

1592
00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:11.610
And here you have,

1593
00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.060
uh,

1594
00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:12.891
and these are the entrance.

1595
00:36:12.891 --> 00:36:13.770
You could go as a tourist,

1596
00:36:13.771 --> 00:36:14.730
you can go right into there.

1597
00:36:14.731 --> 00:36:14.911
I mean,

1598
00:36:14.911 --> 00:36:15.121
these are,

1599
00:36:15.121 --> 00:36:17.700
we're not where these plaques are all I'll put up around here,

1600
00:36:17.701 --> 00:36:19.770
like they're inside of a church.

1601
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:20.460
Uh,

1602
00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:21.690
that's what it looked like.

1603
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:24.720
Then you can see the mall left from do a mall there.

1604
00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:25.220
Uh,

1605
00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:25.500
the,

1606
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:25.880
the,

1607
00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.410
the Doula is a sudden he's used to Plu.

1608
00:36:28.411 --> 00:36:29.250
It's not there anymore.

1609
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:30.270
And as a matter of fact,

1610
00:36:30.271 --> 00:36:31.980
when you go to where the commune was,

1611
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.490
uh,

1612
00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:33.700
the shelling is such that,

1613
00:36:33.701 --> 00:36:34.350
that the,

1614
00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:34.441
uh,

1615
00:36:34.441 --> 00:36:34.740
you know,

1616
00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:35.910
there's a huge heels,

1617
00:36:35.911 --> 00:36:36.091
I mean,

1618
00:36:36.091 --> 00:36:38.580
enormous hills have been created simply by,

1619
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:38.910
uh,

1620
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:39.240
this,

1621
00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.910
this land being blown apart.

1622
00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:42.630
Uh,

1623
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:43.770
and that you're in,

1624
00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:44.713
um,

1625
00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:45.110
you know,

1626
00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:45.360
you're,

1627
00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:45.631
this,

1628
00:36:45.631 --> 00:36:49.320
you lived in the fort as you lived in these trenches and the trenches were,

1629
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:51.390
as the forts are accommodated,

1630
00:36:51.391 --> 00:36:54.600
as best they can to make things a livable,

1631
00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:54.840
uh,

1632
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.150
for those who are about to die.

1633
00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:58.140
Um,

1634
00:36:58.140 --> 00:36:59.490
and here is a,

1635
00:36:59.491 --> 00:36:59.671
you know,

1636
00:36:59.671 --> 00:37:00.540
an infirmary,

1637
00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:01.260
uh,

1638
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.300
where you have your instant amputations,

1639
00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:04.440
uh,

1640
00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.273
there,

1641
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.330
uh,

1642
00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:07.631
and,

1643
00:37:07.631 --> 00:37:08.730
and that's what it looked like.

1644
00:37:08.731 --> 00:37:09.900
And you've seen pictures of the,

1645
00:37:09.901 --> 00:37:10.360
of,

1646
00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.310
of the Somme,

1647
00:37:11.311 --> 00:37:12.810
which I'll talk about maybe next time,

1648
00:37:12.811 --> 00:37:13.570
a little bit.

1649
00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:14.010
Uh,

1650
00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:15.060
they had to build the,

1651
00:37:15.061 --> 00:37:15.894
these uh,

1652
00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:16.933
uh,

1653
00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:19.770
these walkways to get you over all of the mud.

1654
00:37:19.771 --> 00:37:21.360
And then the weather in northern France.

1655
00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:21.660
I,

1656
00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:23.760
whether you're talking about Bologna or anywhere else,

1657
00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:24.040
you know,

1658
00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:24.781
anyone in the channel,

1659
00:37:24.781 --> 00:37:27.690
but all the way really into the northern part of Alsace is,

1660
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:28.710
is pretty dreadful.

1661
00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:29.371
And here again,

1662
00:37:29.371 --> 00:37:30.151
are these craters.

1663
00:37:30.151 --> 00:37:30.391
I mean,

1664
00:37:30.391 --> 00:37:34.050
you're saying you're going to carry 60 pounds through that stuff.

1665
00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:34.900
Uh,

1666
00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:35.790
not really easy.

1667
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:36.331
Uh,

1668
00:37:36.331 --> 00:37:37.410
and Barb wire,

1669
00:37:37.411 --> 00:37:39.540
which I should have mentioned also,

1670
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:39.810
uh,

1671
00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:42.660
is one of those defensive weapons of war along with uh,

1672
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:43.381
uh,

1673
00:37:43.381 --> 00:37:44.430
along with,

1674
00:37:44.431 --> 00:37:44.880
uh,

1675
00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:45.121
uh,

1676
00:37:45.121 --> 00:37:45.421
your,

1677
00:37:45.421 --> 00:37:46.740
your basic machine gun.

1678
00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:47.490
Um,

1679
00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:51.480
and of course one of the things that adds to the weight carried by age soldiers.

1680
00:37:51.481 --> 00:37:54.900
You had to have barbed wire clippers that are going to succeed in cutting the

1681
00:37:54.901 --> 00:37:57.060
Barb wire and the war poets.

1682
00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:57.750
Uh,

1683
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:58.110
you know,

1684
00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:58.531
one of them,

1685
00:37:58.531 --> 00:37:59.041
I can't remember,

1686
00:37:59.041 --> 00:38:00.780
maybe it's Isaac Rosenberger and one of them said that,

1687
00:38:00.781 --> 00:38:00.991
well,

1688
00:38:00.991 --> 00:38:01.350
where,

1689
00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:02.520
where's the finest of Devin?

1690
00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:02.731
Sure.

1691
00:38:02.731 --> 00:38:03.590
There are hung up there,

1692
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:04.290
hung up,

1693
00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:07.860
hung up on that old Barb wire because it was easy to get caught up on the Barb

1694
00:38:07.861 --> 00:38:10.950
wire and simply a parish there.

1695
00:38:10.951 --> 00:38:11.491
And there's your,

1696
00:38:11.491 --> 00:38:11.701
you know,

1697
00:38:11.701 --> 00:38:13.350
your basic real live trench,

1698
00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:14.190
uh,

1699
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:15.000
with these,

1700
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:15.440
uh,

1701
00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:15.690
uh,

1702
00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:15.960
you know,

1703
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.151
with,

1704
00:38:16.151 --> 00:38:16.890
with the helmets,

1705
00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:17.091
the,

1706
00:38:17.091 --> 00:38:17.970
the French troops,

1707
00:38:17.971 --> 00:38:18.540
by the way,

1708
00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:21.030
who'd gone into the war wearing this is true.

1709
00:38:21.031 --> 00:38:23.910
I couldn't invent this bright red pants,

1710
00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:24.480
uh,

1711
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:28.800
that could be seen a fru the mists by,

1712
00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:29.100
uh,

1713
00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:29.933
troops,

1714
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:30.833
uh,

1715
00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:35.380
change to more subtle colors by the end of the war,

1716
00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:35.920
uh,

1717
00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.720
to give them a better chance.

1718
00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:39.430
And so that was the trench.

1719
00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.260
And when you were going to attack,

1720
00:38:41.261 --> 00:38:46.261
what you would do is climb up over the trench and then face this machine gun

1721
00:38:46.361 --> 00:38:48.910
fire and get as far as you could.

1722
00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:49.840
Uh,

1723
00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.900
many did not get very far at all,

1724
00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:53.800
uh,

1725
00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.371
and their,

1726
00:38:54.371 --> 00:38:54.701
uh,

1727
00:38:54.701 --> 00:38:55.360
is,

1728
00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:55.691
uh,

1729
00:38:55.691 --> 00:38:56.290
you know,

1730
00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:58.810
get your head down and hope it doesn't land on you.

1731
00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:00.070
That's how most people died.

1732
00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:02.730
The majority of people died through Shelan,

1733
00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:03.670
uh,

1734
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:05.650
in these kinds of creeping Abraj.

1735
00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:06.910
Those are just basic shelling.

1736
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:08.370
I mean sharpshooters uh,

1737
00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.520
what was also a problem,

1738
00:39:09.521 --> 00:39:12.970
that's how the w if many of you have read the all quiet on the western front and

1739
00:39:12.971 --> 00:39:14.530
that's how he gets killed at the end.

1740
00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:15.100
Uh,

1741
00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:16.320
cause he puts his head up and,

1742
00:39:16.321 --> 00:39:17.154
and uh,

1743
00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:18.460
someone blows it away.

1744
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:19.600
Uh,

1745
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:23.560
but generally they use these kind of periscopes to look up in the survey,

1746
00:39:23.561 --> 00:39:24.394
the scene.

1747
00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:26.440
And if you went out into the trenches,

1748
00:39:26.441 --> 00:39:28.350
it was went out at night is we're connaissance,

1749
00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:28.750
uh,

1750
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:30.520
patrols and that was pretty dangerous.

1751
00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.180
Or if you were particularly heroic,

1752
00:39:32.181 --> 00:39:35.680
and many of these people in the infirmary service were,

1753
00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:40.600
you went out to try to bring back the wounded before they died.

1754
00:39:40.601 --> 00:39:41.320
And that's what,

1755
00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:41.611
uh,

1756
00:39:41.611 --> 00:39:41.831
I mean,

1757
00:39:41.831 --> 00:39:44.800
you have to imagine this as being everything from Switzerland to,

1758
00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:45.730
uh,

1759
00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:46.030
uh,

1760
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:47.890
to the English Channel.

1761
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:49.050
And they are,

1762
00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:51.010
they are preparing grenades.

1763
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.983
Again,

1764
00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:58.230
a lot of people in France and in Germany are hunters and they're used to

1765
00:39:58.231 --> 00:39:59.064
shooting.

1766
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.911
But the idea of,

1767
00:39:59.911 --> 00:40:00.101
you know,

1768
00:40:00.101 --> 00:40:01.290
of throwing a grenade,

1769
00:40:01.291 --> 00:40:01.740
there's not,

1770
00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:03.930
there weren't sports and France then,

1771
00:40:03.931 --> 00:40:04.051
I mean,

1772
00:40:04.051 --> 00:40:04.890
this is a lame,

1773
00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:06.510
and I apologize for this lame analogy,

1774
00:40:06.511 --> 00:40:06.930
but,

1775
00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:08.610
but the idea of throwing a grenade,

1776
00:40:08.611 --> 00:40:10.710
I mean American throw baseballs and stuff like that,

1777
00:40:10.711 --> 00:40:10.950
but,

1778
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:11.430
uh,

1779
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.641
you know,

1780
00:40:11.641 --> 00:40:14.190
it was that even that gesture of throwing something with,

1781
00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:14.760
uh,

1782
00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:15.770
took a little of,

1783
00:40:15.771 --> 00:40:16.561
of getting used to,

1784
00:40:16.561 --> 00:40:18.750
but here they are getting ready to go again.

1785
00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:22.020
Incoming,

1786
00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:26.223
<v 2>yeah.</v>

1787
00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.470
<v 0>Going out at night.</v>

1788
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:31.760
And the other thing is we went out at night.

1789
00:40:31.761 --> 00:40:31.881
I mean,

1790
00:40:31.881 --> 00:40:35.030
you couldn't see that was part of it and you cause you couldn't be seen.

1791
00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:35.661
And of course,

1792
00:40:35.661 --> 00:40:37.280
that's where you can get hung up on,

1793
00:40:37.281 --> 00:40:37.641
on,

1794
00:40:37.641 --> 00:40:38.180
uh,

1795
00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:42.260
on Barb wire that you don't know or encounter another patrol,

1796
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.800
uh,

1797
00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:43.460
from,

1798
00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:43.970
uh,

1799
00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:44.990
from the other side.

1800
00:40:44.991 --> 00:40:46.880
Then they tried to fool each other or they get people that,

1801
00:40:46.881 --> 00:40:47.450
that,

1802
00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:47.901
that,

1803
00:40:47.901 --> 00:40:48.290
uh,

1804
00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:48.501
you know,

1805
00:40:48.501 --> 00:40:49.700
grew up in Alsace to,

1806
00:40:49.701 --> 00:40:50.900
to speak German and,

1807
00:40:50.901 --> 00:40:52.130
and all of that.

1808
00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:53.293
Ah,

1809
00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:54.141
and there was a course,

1810
00:40:54.141 --> 00:40:54.980
a machine gun,

1811
00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:55.830
uh,

1812
00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:56.690
in placement,

1813
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:59.470
second big way of,

1814
00:40:59.480 --> 00:40:59.680
of,

1815
00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:00.740
of getting killed.

1816
00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.000
Go there sometime,

1817
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:02.811
go,

1818
00:41:02.811 --> 00:41:07.700
go and does door devo and do them all and try to imagine what it's like,

1819
00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:07.940
Eh,

1820
00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:09.050
it must've been just,

1821
00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:09.681
uh,

1822
00:41:09.681 --> 00:41:10.490
just something.

1823
00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:11.870
And also the weather is so heavy,

1824
00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:12.891
it's heavy weather,

1825
00:41:12.891 --> 00:41:14.270
so they're addressed rather heavily.

1826
00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:17.750
These are sort of binocular type things there.

1827
00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:18.890
Uh,

1828
00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:19.910
and uh,

1829
00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:20.680
<v 2>wow.</v>

1830
00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:21.513
Woah.

1831
00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:27.630
<v 0>And that's a sleeping accommodations such as you would find a,</v>

1832
00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:28.471
if you look at that,

1833
00:41:28.471 --> 00:41:32.710
you could also imagine being in a submarine Auc as much of this is underground

1834
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.281
are there,

1835
00:41:34.281 --> 00:41:38.060
and then that's where you slept and you try to figure out who didn't come back

1836
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:39.381
after the,

1837
00:41:39.381 --> 00:41:40.910
when the night patrol came back.

1838
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:42.390
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1839
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:44.150
<v 0>Did a telephone systems,</v>

1840
00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:47.270
the Germans had a huge advantage in the east because the Russian telephone

1841
00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:47.631
system,

1842
00:41:47.631 --> 00:41:50.480
they'd managed to figure out how it works and they could hear every single call

1843
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:52.460
if they were within range.

1844
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.660
Uh,

1845
00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:54.111
but the,

1846
00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:56.120
the French system worked better.

1847
00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:57.051
I,

1848
00:41:57.051 --> 00:41:57.531
and,

1849
00:41:57.531 --> 00:41:58.364
um,

1850
00:41:58.850 --> 00:41:59.060
you know,

1851
00:41:59.060 --> 00:41:59.271
I mean,

1852
00:41:59.271 --> 00:41:59.601
we also,

1853
00:41:59.601 --> 00:42:00.570
we're dealing with telegraph,

1854
00:42:00.571 --> 00:42:01.230
so I mean this,

1855
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:02.630
this is modern warfare.

1856
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:07.370
What made it total warfare was the mobilization of an entire society of its

1857
00:42:07.371 --> 00:42:08.690
productive capacity,

1858
00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:09.321
uh,

1859
00:42:09.321 --> 00:42:14.321
to fight this war on and on and on and on.

1860
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.351
And of course,

1861
00:42:15.351 --> 00:42:18.830
how the war ends with the German troops way inside France,

1862
00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:23.980
we'll have enormous repercussions for the poisoning of the 19 20th in 1930s

1863
00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:25.880
because it became easy for Hitler to say,

1864
00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:26.571
and for other,

1865
00:42:26.571 --> 00:42:27.380
he was just wonderful.

1866
00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:28.820
Lots of right wing leaders to say,

1867
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:30.350
we were winning the war.

1868
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:31.340
How do we lose it?

1869
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:32.420
We're inside France.

1870
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:34.100
We were stabbed in the back.

1871
00:42:34.101 --> 00:42:36.080
The dolch stuff's by who?

1872
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.130
The Jews,

1873
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:38.420
the Communists,

1874
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:39.770
the socialists,

1875
00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:41.390
the weak ones,

1876
00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:44.660
not part of the true national volkist community,

1877
00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:45.561
et Cetera,

1878
00:42:45.561 --> 00:42:46.394
et cetera.

1879
00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:47.960
Uh,

1880
00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.220
and bring somebody back.

1881
00:42:49.221 --> 00:42:49.581
He thought,

1882
00:42:49.581 --> 00:42:51.470
I'm sorry to say the man looked a little Pekin,

1883
00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:52.723
uh,

1884
00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:53.713
hauling them back.

1885
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:55.070
And these are guys,

1886
00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:56.290
these are armed soldiers.

1887
00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.640
So this is not your infirmary group.

1888
00:42:58.641 --> 00:42:59.770
There were some respect of,

1889
00:42:59.771 --> 00:43:01.130
of the red flag until,

1890
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:04.280
I mean the Red Cross insignia Signia and the white flag.

1891
00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:05.210
Ah,

1892
00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:06.830
people tended to respect that.

1893
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.920
And also across the know there were these images,

1894
00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:10.610
uh,

1895
00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:11.990
in a place called Alabama,

1896
00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.070
like Albert,

1897
00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:14.630
a town in the town,

1898
00:43:14.631 --> 00:43:15.830
in the song that was completed,

1899
00:43:15.831 --> 00:43:16.664
destroyed.

1900
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:20.810
There was a statue of the Virgin Mary on top of a church and it was hit by a

1901
00:43:20.811 --> 00:43:25.811
shell and it was hanging by a thread and the soldiers on both sides could see

1902
00:43:26.781 --> 00:43:31.781
that the Virgin Mary hanging by a Fred and everyday people think it's going to

1903
00:43:32.601 --> 00:43:33.180
get a hit again.

1904
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:34.280
It's going to fall down.

1905
00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:37.490
And it became that too became this sort of myth about if it fails,

1906
00:43:37.491 --> 00:43:40.550
they're going to be that showed that France is going to lose.

1907
00:43:40.551 --> 00:43:41.150
And,

1908
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:42.340
and all of that are,

1909
00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:43.970
and a lot of these towns like a Haas,

1910
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.780
uh,

1911
00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:45.770
and um,

1912
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:46.270
uh,

1913
00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:47.060
harass,

1914
00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:47.450
uh,

1915
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:47.780
the gift.

1916
00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:49.040
That's how they get to eat a lot of Ras,

1917
00:43:49.041 --> 00:43:51.770
which is one of the great cathedrals in Europe or anywhere else,

1918
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:52.220
uh,

1919
00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:55.040
was destroyed because they're right on the front,

1920
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:57.110
right on the front.

1921
00:43:58.880 --> 00:43:59.713
And again,

1922
00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:00.600
infirmary,

1923
00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.360
there's infirmary guys there.

1924
00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:04.973
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1925
00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:05.943
<v 0>And uh,</v>

1926
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:08.100
I don't know what these people are.

1927
00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:09.400
They're distributing water.

1928
00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:11.470
That's what they're doing there is drawing water,

1929
00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.390
getting ready to go charge over that.

1930
00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:22.090
The ones who didn't make it.

1931
00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:23.960
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1932
00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:27.110
<v 0>There's still a whole trench of with band that sticking up that they more or</v>

1933
00:44:27.111 --> 00:44:27.830
less left away.

1934
00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:28.161
It was,

1935
00:44:28.161 --> 00:44:29.570
you see that too.

1936
00:44:29.571 --> 00:44:33.780
They removed the bones and that's the night patrol going out,

1937
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:35.790
crawling over those craters.

1938
00:44:35.791 --> 00:44:36.840
It gives you a pretty good idea.

1939
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:38.400
See the movie

1940
00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:41.580
explosions,

1941
00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:43.320
why that last one,

1942
00:44:43.321 --> 00:44:43.591
by the way,

1943
00:44:43.591 --> 00:44:45.840
it was simply called [inaudible] hell,

1944
00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.690
which is the way it a way it was.

1945
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:54.450
So we're going to pass on to not necessarily more cheery subjects.

1946
00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:54.840
Uh,

1947
00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.100
next time about,

1948
00:44:56.101 --> 00:45:00.210
we'll talk about why 1917 was the big year I,

1949
00:45:00.211 --> 00:45:00.870
and,

1950
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:01.703
uh,

1951
00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.980
I would talk about the end of the war and what all that meant and again,

1952
00:45:04.981 --> 00:45:09.240
to discuss the impact of all of this on French society.

1953
00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:10.300
See you Wednesday.
