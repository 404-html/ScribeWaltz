1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.590
Okay.
Today I'm going to talk about Paris.

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.320
And in order to talk about Paris and the belly pork in the belly,

3
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:12.010
pope was not good for,
uh,
for most people in France.
Uh,

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.160
it's,
we heard before,
but the image of,
of,
of that nostalgia,

5
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.960
a infused vision of,

6
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:22.080
of Paris and the belly pork is something that of course comes a,

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.850
it really is created.
It's imagined after World War I after World War One.

8
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.560
Uh,
but,
uh,

9
00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:31.860
in order to understand this are the cultural and economic and political and

10
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.190
social dimensions of,
of a fantasy,
Aclu Paris,

11
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.410
we have to back up and look at the rebuilding of Paris in the 1850s and sixties,

12
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.290
uh,
by,
uh,
that,
uh,

13
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.110
man dissed by my late friend I Richard Cobb SEL station at Tila.
Uh,

14
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.550
uh,
that is bear an Oarsman,
uh,

15
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.910
whose name I should have written on the board but didn't,

16
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.040
but in some of you already know about him,

17
00:00:56.041 --> 00:01:00.120
but it's h a u s s m,
a n,

18
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.610
N as Josh.

19
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.510
And he only went back to Paris three times after he left and financial,

20
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.070
uh,
scandal at the end of the 18,
them a sixties.
And He,

21
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:15.100
and he lives until,
uh,
until the early 1890s.
But the,
the,

22
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.080
the great boulevards,
it became identified with,
uh,
uh,

23
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:21.060
with modern Paris and on which,
uh,

24
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.620
Emilio Marie went on this little walk going out to kill,
um,

25
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.680
have to be seen in the context of the rebuilding of Paris during that period.

26
00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:33.120
And it was the largest urban renewal project,
uh,
in,
uh,

27
00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:35.910
at that time in the history of,
of cities,
uh,

28
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.170
really the only ones comparable where the rebuilding of Eto,

29
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.310
that is Tokyo after the great fire,
uh,
and,
uh,

30
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.320
London at the time of Christopher Wren.

31
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.040
So we back up even further to look at Paris,
uh,

32
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.210
in a 1837,
just to give you a sense of,

33
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.510
of what changed.
And the first thing you noticed,

34
00:01:56.511 --> 00:02:00.400
particularly if you're comparing it to,
to London or to Berlin,
uh,

35
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.550
is how small a Paris was and help how small Paris still is.
Uh,

36
00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:07.590
this is pre 1860.

37
00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:10.740
So it's before that the inner suburbs were annexed,

38
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.300
which included Mamako out there and a tie and,
and all of the others.

39
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.260
Uh,
and those of you who've been to Paris or know about Paris,
we'll see the,

40
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.820
the job y'all down to on Sambul there,
which was very,
very close to,
uh,
uh,

41
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.940
to the city limits at that time.
And then there's the two ways,

42
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.970
three and then the edge of Paris.
There they are,
uh,
uh,
the trauma,

43
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.650
which was begun by Napoleon,
uh,
and,
uh,
completed,
uh,
during,

44
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.040
uh,
the July monarchy.
So,
uh,
Paris tremendously,
uh,

45
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.740
overcrowded place and the most densely populated parts of Paris until,
uh,

46
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.310
mid century,
uh,
were the,
the,

47
00:02:47.311 --> 00:02:51.630
the evil of CTA that is the island of CFA,
uh,
uh,
uh,

48
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.190
citv.
There's north Saddam and the,
my hey mer,

49
00:02:56.191 --> 00:03:00.730
ais,
the sort of central right bank,
uh,
districts,
uh,

50
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:05.280
and their population density is three times what it is,
uh,

51
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.730
today.
Uh,
and so the population of Paris,
uh,

52
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.740
which grows so rapidly,
uh,
in,

53
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:15.370
in 1851 is 1,000,050 3000 people,

54
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.490
1861 a year after the annexation of the,
of the inner suburbs,
uh,

55
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.420
is 1,000,690 6,000,
1872,
after the commune,

56
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.860
1 million,
825,000 minus the 25,000 people slaughtered,

57
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.660
uh,
uh,
in the wake of the commune during bloody week 1881,
uh,
2 million,

58
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:38.270
269,018 96,
uh,

59
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.100
about two and a half million people.
And so,
you know,

60
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.130
European cities only grow basically in the first two thirds of the 19th century

61
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.990
through migration because more people die in cities than are born there.
A why?

62
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.930
Because of of a unhealthy quarters.
Uh,
uh,

63
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.520
the life expectancy and legal,
for example,
was about 19 years old.
Uh,

64
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.860
the same thing in Manchester or that counts includes infant mortality.

65
00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:09.670
So that's a little bit skewed.
Uh,
but still cities are unhealthy places,

66
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.710
old people,
uh,
the miserably poor people also go to Paris,
uh,
um,

67
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.980
uh,
to try to find charity and,

68
00:04:16.981 --> 00:04:20.650
and ultimately to die child abandonment and fantasize and all the things that I

69
00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:23.430
mentioned before,
uh,
uh,
disease,
uh,

70
00:04:23.431 --> 00:04:27.550
the collar or disease rips through Paris in 1832 and 1849,

71
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.630
again in 1884.
So basically,
I mean,
cities,

72
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:36.100
large cities replenish themselves only through immigration through a much of the

73
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:37.000
19th century.

74
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.830
And so what happens is you've got this sort of super hyper overcrowding of the

75
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:46.630
central districts as a immigrants from the north of France,
from Normandy,

76
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.760
from the east of France,
also seasonal migrants from the Leemoo,
Zach,
uh,

77
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:56.200
who finally settled in Paris,
poor into the central districts.

78
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.670
And then gradually I had for,
uh,

79
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.770
the edge of a of the city.
Uh,

80
00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:07.360
it's not until the 1880s that you have the huge wave of black,
tall,

81
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.170
uh,
of migration from,
from,
from Brittany.
Uh,

82
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.930
and it's not just a Paris also,
but,
but,
uh,
that,

83
00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:18.260
that comes later then we're talking about.
But so you've got your basic,
uh,

84
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.640
extraordinarily crowded,
um,
uh,
a city,
uh,

85
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.040
the ranks of the poor above all,
a swollen by immigration.
The difference,

86
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:30.520
one of the differences between the 19th century and now for example,

87
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:33.700
is in the 19th century,
uh,
most people,

88
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:35.620
the people coming into Paris were already poor.

89
00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:40.150
We're poor than the people who are already there.
Now in the 1950s,
in 1960s,

90
00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:44.650
that changes the 1950s in 1960s,
you have these young Cooper,
you have,
you know,

91
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:48.910
young,
you know,
married couples,
upwardly mobile,
uh,
uh,

92
00:05:48.911 --> 00:05:52.570
who come to Paris with enough money that they've put together to rent and then

93
00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:56.440
finally maybe to buy an apartment,
uh,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
But,
uh,

94
00:05:56.441 --> 00:06:00.500
you have a mass of,
of,
of poor people,
masses of poor people coming,
uh,
uh,

95
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.460
into Paris.
And Paris is unhealthy.
This I put in,
I mean,

96
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:08.090
this is how I handle handball in fact,
but this is,
I mean,
this is a,
um,
you know,

97
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:11.330
I,
I've said before about how you just try to imagine what things are like until

98
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:15.260
you can see actually for the first time,
this is the first photo of Paris.

99
00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:18.860
This is a guy teeth.
It was a primitive kind of photo.
This is a,

100
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:23.120
you can identify this as,
as the rue a as a full blown do Tom,

101
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.210
uh,
uh,
on the edge of Paris.
And this is a 18,
uh,

102
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.120
a 1837,
but here's your,
your classic sort of image of,
of,

103
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.800
of urban,
urban poverty,
urban squalor,

104
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.390
the kind of gray kind of gray,
uh,

105
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.730
images of a street that no longer exists.
Uh,
uh,

106
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.970
because of ost months rebuilding.
This was behind the Ponti.
All that is,
uh,

107
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.640
just soar above of the Latin quarter.

108
00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:54.440
And you see this ditch running right down the,
uh,
uh,
right down the street.

109
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.440
I mean,
he carried sewage.
I mean,
there were,
there were already sewers in Paris,

110
00:06:57.441 --> 00:07:00.590
but it was terribly unhealthy.
And you're,
you're thinking,
oh,
why,
you know,

111
00:07:00.591 --> 00:07:03.340
he says it's so crowded,
but we're all the people,
you know,

112
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.390
it looks like there's nobody there will,
in fact,

113
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:09.200
it's because it took so long to expose,
you know,
photos that there actually,

114
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.330
you look very closely,
you can see some people.

115
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.750
But there's another reason why they're not a lot of people about or any signs of

116
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:18.050
life is that this has already been targeted for demolition.

117
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.870
And the people have had to move out of what was already a poor neighborhood,
uh,

118
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.260
to find an even poorer one on the margins of urban life.

119
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.900
That is the photography.
That was a photograph by shot on amount of veal.
Um,

120
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.270
and here we got the,
you know,
Louis Napoleon,
your basic picture of,
of uh,
uh,

121
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.980
Louis Napoleon,
uh,
uh,
for once,
not at the opera,
tried to,

122
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.370
tried to hit on the young ballerinas.
Uh,
and the man in the middle is ost mine,

123
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.040
uh,
who was not born in Alsace.
Uh,

124
00:07:46.041 --> 00:07:49.520
but his family came from Alsace and he'd been a law student in Paris and he was

125
00:07:49.521 --> 00:07:52.940
born in the more prosperous western part of Paris.
Again,

126
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:57.941
the dichotomy between prosperous west and and a more impoverished east is as

127
00:07:58.431 --> 00:08:03.140
important as increasingly a prosper center,
uh,

128
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:07.250
uh,
over the long run of time and the impoverished periphery.

129
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:11.690
More about that in a minute.
So,
uh,
in 1852,
uh,

130
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.100
Napoleon,
uh,
uh,

131
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.610
spreads out a map of a city he really didn't know very well and Napoleon the

132
00:08:16.611 --> 00:08:21.190
third desk and says,
I want you to build me great boulevards.
And so,
oh,
smart,

133
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.450
who's prefect of the sin does that.
Uh,

134
00:08:23.451 --> 00:08:27.830
and it's a time when the wealthy got wealthier that,
that,
uh,
uh,
in the,
uh,

135
00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.950
the poor did a better working class,
people did better.
Uh,

136
00:08:30.951 --> 00:08:35.720
but the gap between the rich and the poor,
uh,
increased.
So the,

137
00:08:35.721 --> 00:08:39.860
now if you're looking later in,
uh,
you know,
an 1855,

138
00:08:39.861 --> 00:08:44.480
you see that the city had expanded,
but you still have the wall around Paris,
uh,

139
00:08:44.481 --> 00:08:48.290
and you still have these sort of rural areas within,
within the city.

140
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:52.340
And one of the points of this is that that's continuing implosion of population

141
00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:53.630
into Paris.
Uh,

142
00:08:53.631 --> 00:08:58.631
and the eviction high prices and by demolition with the rebuilding of Paris is

143
00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:03.370
going to push people out into the working class periphery.
That visa,

144
00:09:03.371 --> 00:09:05.670
which I talked about before,
that's where I meet.
He says,

145
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:10.230
it's war between you and me.
Now,
baby,
uh,
lobby let,
uh,

146
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.230
[inaudible] here,
uh,
which was,
uh,

147
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:17.970
and it was indeed still at this time fairly a rural,
oh,
well,

148
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.940
you have to just all,
you know,
move your heads to see.

149
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:24.810
This is not a very interesting a photo,
but it's not hardly a photo.

150
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.550
But just to see that the,
uh,

151
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:31.410
the difference between 1850 and 18,
um,
uh,

152
00:09:31.411 --> 00:09:36.360
in 1900,
uh,
the growth of,
of the suburbs now,

153
00:09:36.361 --> 00:09:40.890
um,
and so this all involved the demolition of,
of uh,
uh,

154
00:09:40.891 --> 00:09:45.570
great hills.
This was a hill at [inaudible],
which is a right to,
you know,

155
00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.830
I'm the San,
uh,
and it put tens of thousands of,

156
00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.730
of workers,
uh,
gave them something to do.

157
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:57.920
Now the principle of this is the re,
uh,
of the planning itself.
And this,
you know,

158
00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.280
impacts,
uh,
this,

159
00:09:59.281 --> 00:10:04.020
this course and the Paris of this course is really built upon classical

160
00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:07.720
principles of associated with absolute monarchs.
Uh,

161
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:12.480
and I call it the imperialism of the straight line.
I in that,
um,

162
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:16.170
if you think of a city like St Petersburg built by Peter,
the great,

163
00:10:16.171 --> 00:10:19.350
or if you think of my dream I built by Phillip the second,

164
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:24.090
or you think of Berlin and Frederick the grade,
or you think of Sy,
uh,

165
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.120
of rather prosperous suburb.
Uh,
they were,
they,

166
00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.960
they were power alleys down which you march troops,
uh,

167
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:35.340
and very different than the kind of organic city that had grown up from medieval

168
00:10:35.341 --> 00:10:39.540
origins.
The city like Strasbourg,
uh,
or for that matter Leone,

169
00:10:39.541 --> 00:10:42.900
the Leone has some classical touches too in the plus Bella Cook and all of that.

170
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.500
But,
but here,
just to give you an obvious and,
and,
and almost banal example,

171
00:10:46.501 --> 00:10:50.280
but I chose it because you already know about the avenue of the OPA,
Huh?
Uh,

172
00:10:50.281 --> 00:10:51.610
for reasons,
um,
you know,

173
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:55.800
we talked about before is that this is pure imperialism of the straight line.

174
00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.440
The problematic or the question is how you get,

175
00:10:58.441 --> 00:11:02.040
you're going to build this big boulevard.
How do you get from,
uh,

176
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.390
the sen basically,

177
00:11:03.391 --> 00:11:06.780
here's the root of Rivoli paralleling the sin to where you're going to build

178
00:11:06.781 --> 00:11:10.170
this new magnificent opera that you saw before.
Well,

179
00:11:10.171 --> 00:11:13.410
you don't have to be an architectural genius or Vincent Scully or something like

180
00:11:13.411 --> 00:11:15.680
that.
You simply take a ruler and,

181
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.630
and then you tip off your friends about where the building is going to go.

182
00:11:18.631 --> 00:11:21.390
So they make a lot of money and that's what this man did.

183
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.350
And you plan the Avenue to Lopa Huh?
And they're three reasons.

184
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:30.351
Three why Paris has rebuilt first to bring more light and air to Paris to make

185
00:11:32.311 --> 00:11:36.810
it a healthier place,
more sewers and all that.
Second,

186
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:42.440
to free the flow of capital for capital to help business.

187
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:45.530
It's not a coincidence that the big department stores,
uh,

188
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:49.980
that grew up in the fifties and sixties are on the ground boulevard or on the

189
00:11:49.981 --> 00:11:53.740
big boulevards.
And third,
and I've alluded to before,

190
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.090
how do you build a barricade across a huge boulevard across,

191
00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:02.140
how do you build a barricade across the avenue?
Lopa Ha,
uh,
the first,
uh,

192
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:06.130
barricades in Paris,
uh,
we're in the late 16th century.
You know,

193
00:12:06.131 --> 00:12:09.250
about the barricades.
Are you,
some of you do any way of the French revolution.

194
00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:13.000
They're more barricades in 1830.
The more barricades in 1851,

195
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:18.210
you've seen photos of barricades from 1871 and [inaudible] says this.

196
00:12:18.311 --> 00:12:19.060
And this memoirs,

197
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:24.060
we want to create barricade proof boulevards and world war two during,

198
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:29.020
um,
uh,
you know,
in a,
in August of 1944,
you know,
the bolt,

199
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.350
the barricades that are built against the German troops,
uh,

200
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:36.610
are built in neighborhoods often,
you know that where you have narrow streets.

201
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.830
And in 1968,
it's the same thing.

202
00:12:38.831 --> 00:12:40.930
It was very hard to build a boulevard across the boulevard,

203
00:12:40.931 --> 00:12:43.720
Sammy Shell or barricade across the boulevard,
San Michelle.

204
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:48.360
So that's the first thing.
And then you imagine you're looking down a,
uh,

205
00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.490
you know,
you're looking at Johnny's opera,

206
00:12:51.491 --> 00:12:55.150
which is going to rise out of the ground.
Uh,

207
00:12:55.151 --> 00:12:59.980
the most expensive building a built in Paris to that point.
Um,

208
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:04.390
and then these houses with which are actually fairly middleclass buildings have

209
00:13:04.391 --> 00:13:06.180
to be demolished.
So you are,

210
00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.210
you were sitting in a bulldozer looking at through the smoke.
Uh,

211
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:15.540
and then there is a Yonnie's opera being built and there is gone.

212
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.510
The A's a opera,
uh,
right here.
And then of course,

213
00:13:19.511 --> 00:13:22.380
that square now contains probably the largest,
uh,
uh,

214
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.650
population of pickpockets and a of this side of the Spanish steps as Americans,

215
00:13:26.651 --> 00:13:29.770
uh,
tourists,
uh,
you know,
get off the metro.

216
00:13:29.771 --> 00:13:33.220
They're looking for American Express with their wallets about to be soon to

217
00:13:33.221 --> 00:13:37.270
disappear.
Um,
but,
uh,
and he,
and here you,
you know,

218
00:13:37.271 --> 00:13:41.830
you can look down and see this is reversed but has make a but difference.
Uh,
uh,

219
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:45.610
you can see that's the plus Vendome the column of which was brought down in,

220
00:13:45.611 --> 00:13:49.870
in uh,
in 1871 at core base,
uh,
um,

221
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.630
uh,
suggestion.
Uh,

222
00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:57.130
and so you end up with this,
which you've already seen before.

223
00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.390
The Avenue Lopera high,

224
00:13:58.391 --> 00:14:03.190
and it was down here the for the first bomb that one replaced with down here at,

225
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.840
at number 11.
And so this is again,
a photo from 1900.
Um,

226
00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.240
so this is,
uh,

227
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:13.630
basically there are a few automobiles racing around the nut racing that the

228
00:14:13.631 --> 00:14:18.040
speed limit was three miles an hour.
Uh,
but,
uh,
now of course,
uh,
you know,

229
00:14:18.041 --> 00:14:22.060
you're a dead duck if you try to cross.
Uh,
there,
uh,
there was somebody,

230
00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:25.720
some general who was arrested,
some scandal and he just didn't testified.

231
00:14:25.721 --> 00:14:28.510
And then he wasn't thinking he walked out into the street and was run over by a

232
00:14:28.511 --> 00:14:31.960
bus.
Uh,
so you really kind have to watch it there,
but,
but here's your pure sir.

233
00:14:31.961 --> 00:14:36.220
Oh,
Smollen vista of Paris.
Uh,
and,
and of course the,
the,

234
00:14:36.221 --> 00:14:40.810
the balconies is her ornate balconies of the third republic are something that,

235
00:14:40.811 --> 00:14:45.310
that,
uh,
one,
um,
identifies with the,
you know,
the grand juror of,

236
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:49.600
of,
of modern Paris,
the Paris of the belly book.
Now,
uh,

237
00:14:49.601 --> 00:14:53.480
what about the people who were from the central districts?
This is a dot.

238
00:14:53.481 --> 00:14:57.320
A very interesting print,
but it's still,
it was sympathetic to those people.
Uh,

239
00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:00.140
if you rented,
most people didn't own apartments,
they rented.
And,

240
00:15:00.141 --> 00:15:04.490
and if you were kicked out of your apartment in order to facilitate the building

241
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:09.140
of these boulevards,
you were,
uh,
given the equivalent robot a day's wages.

242
00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:12.590
And that was it.
And here you have,
this is,
uh,
uh,
part two.

243
00:15:12.591 --> 00:15:16.670
These are two lithographs and the first is called Osman is aweseome of that is

244
00:15:16.671 --> 00:15:19.550
the bulldozing of the hospitalization of Paris,

245
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.640
part one where you see these people and they've got everything that they have.

246
00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.880
You know,
they've got their dog and it's,
it's,
it's,
it's a,
uh,
it's a look.

247
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:32.390
It's a sympathetic look at them.
And this is part two,

248
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:37.640
and this is a pure,
oh,
[inaudible] vista.
This is,
uh,
uh,
very near the Oprah.
Aha.

249
00:15:37.641 --> 00:15:42.020
This is the Church of Santa Augustine,
which I think is just God awful.
Uh,
but,

250
00:15:42.021 --> 00:15:44.240
but here again,
you have the,
the,
the uh,
you know,

251
00:15:44.241 --> 00:15:46.040
again the imperialism of the straight line.

252
00:15:46.041 --> 00:15:47.870
And this is the big commercial district.

253
00:15:47.871 --> 00:15:50.900
This is where the big department stores are near there.

254
00:15:50.901 --> 00:15:54.740
Like the Gallery Lafayette and,
and uh,
and the,
uh,

255
00:15:54.741 --> 00:15:58.490
at this time they go on magazine who move and,
and all these sorts of things.

256
00:15:58.491 --> 00:16:02.810
So that's what,
that's the principle of,
of,
oh,
what's happened here of Bozeman?

257
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.910
Well,
that's,
you can hardly see that I'm a mess.
How do I turn this?

258
00:16:07.911 --> 00:16:12.580
Uh,
is there any way I can turn this off?
Do you remember?

259
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:18.380
How do I do that?
Which was all of them there.

260
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.870
This for a sec so I can see it.
So if you,
if you were,

261
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:24.740
you're a bird flying around up here,
um,
and then,

262
00:16:24.741 --> 00:16:29.240
or if you're in a balloon a and you're seeing the results of,
of,
of Ost Mon,

263
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:31.550
here again,
you've got Notredame,

264
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.570
which goes from the most populated part appointed Paris along with,

265
00:16:35.571 --> 00:16:38.780
in my hay to the least populated part of Paris.
Why?

266
00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:43.050
And we talk a lot about the state,
but the state buildings,
he's,
uh,
uh,

267
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.240
or state constructions,

268
00:16:44.241 --> 00:16:48.230
including the big hospital Otalgia or their prefecture of police,
uh,

269
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:53.000
are built on,
uh,
on CTA.
And so the population,
uh,
uh,

270
00:16:53.001 --> 00:16:56.070
departs this over here is the church of [inaudible] piece,
which had the,

271
00:16:56.071 --> 00:16:59.030
one of the Great Oregon's,
and here,
uh,
uh,

272
00:16:59.031 --> 00:17:01.700
this is the famous market of layout,
uh,

273
00:17:01.701 --> 00:17:05.390
which was built at this time in the next to the church.
It was telling you stash,

274
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.220
and it lasted until till 1972 and they wouldn't,
uh,
uh,

275
00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:14.810
they tore them all down and built a sort of miserable failure,
uh,

276
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.220
uh,
three floors of,
of crummy,
crummy,

277
00:17:19.221 --> 00:17:23.930
a electronic stores.
And,
uh,
uh,
and they didn't even leave one.

278
00:17:23.931 --> 00:17:27.140
So people,
I sound like a Scaly,
but,
but,
uh,
it's true.
They didn't,

279
00:17:27.141 --> 00:17:29.930
they wouldn't leave just one.
So people could see what was like,

280
00:17:29.931 --> 00:17:33.230
what was the market.
And I was lucky to get,
first time I ever was in Paris,
uh,

281
00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.160
when I was a kid,

282
00:17:34.161 --> 00:17:36.260
somebody took me down there in the middle of the night and you could see the

283
00:17:36.261 --> 00:17:40.580
butchers,
you know,
drinking,
uh,
with very sort of,
uh,
a free k,

284
00:17:40.581 --> 00:17:44.400
very prosperous clients.
Uh,
uh,
uh,
eating,
uh,
at,
uh,

285
00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:47.930
eating a big table,
uh,
uh,
next there.
And it was fantastic.

286
00:17:47.931 --> 00:17:51.870
It was the guts of Paris was the heart of Paris and they just destroyed it.
Uh,

287
00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:56.220
and they had to move the market to buy or the airport because Paris,
you know,

288
00:17:56.250 --> 00:18:00.300
it's so big with 11 million people in the,
in the region now.
But it just,

289
00:18:00.301 --> 00:18:04.550
it didn't make any sense to destroy them all.
It was so such vandalism,
just,
just,

290
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:08.520
just incredible.
And it came of a time at the time of pumpy Doo who,
uh,

291
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:12.240
who said that we must renounce this outmoded aesthetic that has anything that

292
00:18:12.241 --> 00:18:14.620
was beautiful and interesting and he was a patron of art,

293
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:19.680
of a modern art and all this worst forms.
But anyway,
um,
yeah,
my back.

294
00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:22.440
But okay,
here's the,
uh,
here's the,

295
00:18:22.441 --> 00:18:25.290
the continuation of the root of Rivoli,
uh,

296
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:30.270
which had been begun by Napoleon and it gives you a major access,
uh,

297
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.910
that is west East.
Uh,
and,
and as we'll see in a minute,

298
00:18:33.911 --> 00:18:37.830
he also creates a north south access because the,
or access,
what am I saying?

299
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:39.930
Well,
access to say the same thing.

300
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:43.740
So that just gives you a kind of a view from the top.
And here are,
uh,

301
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:46.890
here are these,
these,
uh,
Leon,
I mean,

302
00:18:46.891 --> 00:18:49.320
this is the old market that was there and I was lucky cause you know,

303
00:18:49.321 --> 00:18:53.370
it was gone about two or two years later or something like that.
And,
uh,

304
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:57.800
uh,
I had met a person who was kind enough to a lodge me in to take me,
uh,

305
00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:03.120
down to,
um,
to see,
uh,
uh,
to see that and it's just gone.
Now.

306
00:19:03.121 --> 00:19:06.970
They have yet another plan to,
to do something and it,
and it just becomes this,

307
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:11.010
oh,
it's,
well,
okay.
So,
uh,
again,
bringing,

308
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.360
freeing the flow of capital of commerce,
et Cetera,
et Cetera,
was a worthy goal.

309
00:19:15.361 --> 00:19:17.070
Indeed.
Uh,
and,
uh,

310
00:19:17.071 --> 00:19:20.760
one of the things that the pulling in third did was just to celebrate France

311
00:19:20.761 --> 00:19:22.410
with these expositions.
And of course,

312
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:26.940
the idea of having a big exposition is that of,
uh,
uh,
of the Victorians.
I mean,

313
00:19:26.941 --> 00:19:31.620
the big one in 1851 at the Crystal Palace,
uh,
uh,
the first,
uh,
uh,

314
00:19:31.621 --> 00:19:36.240
public toilets by the way,
uh,
uh,
at such things where in 1851 in,

315
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.440
in London,
and so I'm losing,
they Polian has other expositions that's when,

316
00:19:40.441 --> 00:19:43.350
as 1854.
And so the principle of this,

317
00:19:43.351 --> 00:19:47.430
as you walk down one of these exhibition halls and you look and you see

318
00:19:47.431 --> 00:19:51.690
paintings on the right,
you see the wonders of science on the left,
uh,
et Cetera,

319
00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:54.300
et cetera.
Uh,
and millions of people go,

320
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.510
and that's the same principle as the department store,
isn't it?

321
00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:02.100
Except that you can buy what you see.
Uh,
and the department stores,

322
00:20:02.101 --> 00:20:06.720
what they do is they destroy local commerce.
Uh,
uh,
unless,

323
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:07.261
you know,

324
00:20:07.261 --> 00:20:11.610
like boot makers and very skilled craftsmen are on the boulevards near the

325
00:20:11.611 --> 00:20:16.470
department stores or provide the essential services in working class districts.

326
00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:21.270
So,
uh,
the goal magazine,
Duluth is here.
I mean,
you have all the space.

327
00:20:21.271 --> 00:20:25.320
It becomes a,
as I said,
the cathedral,
the modernity along with the others.

328
00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.020
And now there are the equivalent of department stores in Paris.

329
00:20:28.021 --> 00:20:32.350
And some of the arcades already in the 18,
not arcades in our,

330
00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:37.320
but the arcades in the Parisian sense in the 18,
uh,
1820s.

331
00:20:37.321 --> 00:20:39.750
And there,
there are even,
you know,
sort of,
uh,

332
00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:42.660
prodo department stores exist before that,

333
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.410
but it's the fifties and sixties that brings to London and the Vienna and Berlin

334
00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.870
and to Paris VA department store where you could buy,
you know,

335
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:54.340
40 different kinds of shawls,
cheap shawls to very fancy shoals.

336
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:59.490
So it's going to attract not only ordinary people looking occasionally for

337
00:20:59.771 --> 00:21:04.630
bargains.
Uh,
and as I said before,
it's a form of,
of,
of,
of,
uh,

338
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:09.160
it creates jobs for working class and peasant women who become sales clerks

339
00:21:09.161 --> 00:21:13.540
living in terrible conditions and kind of dormitories and almost prison like

340
00:21:13.541 --> 00:21:16.900
rules.
But it also brings the,
the,
the free k,

341
00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:20.620
the wealthy people will come in in their carriages and have their drivers await

342
00:21:20.621 --> 00:21:24.490
them when they go in and listen to people sing Christmas carols on the stay on

343
00:21:24.491 --> 00:21:27.460
the stairs.
And when electricity becomes,
you know,

344
00:21:27.461 --> 00:21:31.780
common in the 1880s in 1890s,
you have these dazzling,
uh,

345
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:36.900
displays that,
that change in,
uh,
in,
uh,
you know,
uh,

346
00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:40.960
in the,
the,
the,
along the streets.
Uh,
and so they become a,

347
00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.550
I mean,
we're really a site of tourism,
uh,
themselves.
Uh,

348
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:50.110
and so here's your basic idea is to create,
the problem is how do you get from,

349
00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:54.850
this is north,
this is south,
uh,
and this is,
uh,
east this as West,

350
00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.100
uh,
that there was no way of getting anywhere.

351
00:21:57.101 --> 00:21:59.120
The two biggest streets in Paris in terms of,

352
00:21:59.121 --> 00:22:02.420
of the most important ones were the Roussanne knee and the roof,
a seminar town.

353
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.850
A police don't remember these names.
Uh,
and so what they do is they create,
uh,
uh,

354
00:22:06.851 --> 00:22:10.930
the boulevard stemi Shell,
which is a disaster here.
Uh,
and then because of,

355
00:22:10.931 --> 00:22:14.620
you know,
Mcdonald's and all this stuff,
uh,
uh,
just awful,
just terrible zoning.

356
00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:15.870
And then here,
uh,

357
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:20.410
what became the boulevard Sebastopol and Bula send a knee that goes out to the

358
00:22:20.411 --> 00:22:22.270
railroad stations.
And of course,

359
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.990
what's mine is often castigated for having built a railroad stations next to

360
00:22:25.991 --> 00:22:28.420
each other without having anticipated the automobile.

361
00:22:28.421 --> 00:22:31.780
But how could he know about the automobile and the 1850s and sixties.

362
00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.990
So they complete the sort of star,
the [inaudible] here,

363
00:22:34.991 --> 00:22:38.880
which is the place of plots of the,
uh,
of the Arc de Triomphe.
Um,

364
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.830
and uh,
create,
uh,
you know,

365
00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.190
he finishes the root to Rivoli,
uh,
here.

366
00:22:45.191 --> 00:22:49.960
And of course as long that access as you saw that the troops come in May of
1851,

367
00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:54.610
uh,
decimating the,
those who resisted in these neighborhoods.

368
00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:59.380
So those are,
those are basically the plans that he wanted to,
to do.

369
00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:04.090
So,
um,
here we go.
Uh,
this is the route or have a lead.

370
00:23:04.091 --> 00:23:06.400
This is down,
it sort of completion.

371
00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:11.290
This is heading east and the troops moved down this way.
Um,
and that,

372
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:14.950
uh,
it,
this parallels the sand.
This is the tower,

373
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:18.890
the remaining part of the tour of Sun Jock.
Uh,
that is there.
Um,

374
00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:23.350
and then now this is looking north.
Um,
and,
uh,

375
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.780
you're crossing CTA now.
Uh,

376
00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:28.630
this is where the police were that Shat delay in the 18th century.

377
00:23:28.631 --> 00:23:32.800
But the point is that you see in the distance,
uh,
the station of the east,

378
00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:37.300
the guy the last and so me,
it's very,
he's very successful.
He's not an intern.

379
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.910
I mean,
he's in many ways not an interesting man or smile.

380
00:23:39.911 --> 00:23:42.130
I was asked to write a biography of him once and I didn't do it.

381
00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:46.180
I gave it to someone else.
And of course,
Paris,
the Paris is the big story.
Uh,

382
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.090
but he,
I mean,
he was a fun function air.
He was a,
a technocrat,
uh,

383
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:55.100
but he was very good at what he did from repress people to building a
boulevards.

384
00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:59.100
And,
and so,
I mean,
this is a success there.
It frees up,
uh,

385
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:03.050
the flow of circulation,
but it chases people like this.
Uh,

386
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:06.800
this is a pawn shop that still exists as the municipal pawn shop.

387
00:24:06.801 --> 00:24:09.920
It's exactly the same space where it was at this time.

388
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:14.120
And anyone who looked at this would know,
uh,

389
00:24:14.121 --> 00:24:16.880
what the image is because these people are so poor.

390
00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:20.150
They are about to sell back their mattress number.

391
00:24:20.151 --> 00:24:21.460
What I said that unless I'm wired,

392
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:26.410
that is your Vez dies like a dog and a bed of Straw.
Um,
more or less,
uh,

393
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:30.530
that,
I mean the,
the last dignity that you had was it's still have a mattress.

394
00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:34.070
And when things got so bad,
that was what went the mattress.

395
00:24:34.071 --> 00:24:37.930
And so these folks are carrying out carrying mattresses to,
uh,

396
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:41.610
try to get what they can from them.
And then you've got,
you know,
the,

397
00:24:41.611 --> 00:24:46.190
the very poor down and out being expelled to the periphery even more.

398
00:24:46.191 --> 00:24:48.910
This is a,
um,
uh,
this is,
uh,

399
00:24:48.911 --> 00:24:51.630
a place where people who could get a little bit of food,
uh,

400
00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:55.190
from charitable organizations.
This is in Monaca,
uh,

401
00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:59.090
and I just put this in is around the corner actually from our apartment.
But uh,

402
00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.520
uh,
this is,
uh,
a classic kind of Oh,

403
00:25:01.521 --> 00:25:06.480
small building and architects had started to sign their work on the,

404
00:25:06.481 --> 00:25:09.050
on the premiere.
Hey Taj,
on the,
on the second floor.

405
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:12.890
So this architect was called [inaudible] and it has the name,
the date there.

406
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:16.520
And these balconies are more ornate really than the ones that they did in

407
00:25:16.521 --> 00:25:20.570
general at the time of oh,
smile.
And these are more sort of third republic ones,

408
00:25:20.571 --> 00:25:24.420
but these are some very handsome buildings that,
uh,
that line,
uh,

409
00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:29.100
this is that line of Boulevard at lines,
the inlines,
the,
the,
the,
uh,

410
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:33.890
the root of Tom.
Now and here we got a,
this is cracked.
I'm sorry.
Uh,

411
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.170
but this is the,
the station of the east.

412
00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:41.330
And when I see the station and always case me twinge of sadness because in 1914,

413
00:25:41.331 --> 00:25:43.910
all the people charging up to the station,
uh,
uh,

414
00:25:43.911 --> 00:25:48.740
screaming Abela La Harbor Law to Berlin,
to Berlin.
And,
and uh,
you know,

415
00:25:48.741 --> 00:25:51.830
this is one of the longer the station to the north.
I mean,

416
00:25:51.831 --> 00:25:56.030
lead the troops to the front from which many of them,
most,
many of them,

417
00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:00.140
a million and a half,
never returned.
Um,
and also,
uh,

418
00:26:00.141 --> 00:26:04.190
so many from the stations.
So many Jews were rounded up by the Germans,

419
00:26:04.191 --> 00:26:08.980
but above all by the French police,
uh,
in 1942 and 1943,
uh,

420
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:13.110
were sent on their way to draw a seat to the transit camp,
uh,

421
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:17.750
north of Paris,
and then onto,
uh,
onto the,
onto the death camps.

422
00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.620
And,
uh,
again,

423
00:26:21.621 --> 00:26:26.621
one of the themes is that all of this makes all of this makes this West East

424
00:26:27.351 --> 00:26:31.130
division even more salient,
uh,

425
00:26:31.131 --> 00:26:35.090
and makes the center periphery,
um,
uh,

426
00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:38.990
contrast or juxtaposition even more important.
Uh,

427
00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:44.790
Louis Napoleon had spent a lot of time in London.
He loved parks.
And so he,
he,
uh,

428
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:49.980
um,
he has them work on the water balloon and he blown.
Yeah.

429
00:26:49.981 --> 00:26:51.540
And to the west of Paris,

430
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:56.780
fancy feeding the receiving people from the fancier corridors and these kinds of

431
00:26:57.661 --> 00:27:01.950
Cafe Corsair,
uh,
along the shots.
Lycee are part of,
again,

432
00:27:01.951 --> 00:27:05.580
of this east west,
a dichotomy.
Um,

433
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:11.580
they,
one can say,
oh,
math,
wait a minute.
Okay.
Um,

434
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:14.580
and then it's not to say that there weren't parks in the east.

435
00:27:14.581 --> 00:27:18.600
This is the beauty show mall,
uh,
which is to the,
to the east.

436
00:27:18.601 --> 00:27:19.261
And there's a lot of,

437
00:27:19.261 --> 00:27:24.060
apparently a lot of real high stakes bull games are still are still played here.

438
00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.460
So there were places,
uh,

439
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.190
Paris has very little green space compared to London and Berlin,
Berlin,

440
00:27:29.191 --> 00:27:33.780
25% of Berlin is,
is a green space and lemons about the same thing.
Paris,

441
00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:38.560
it's 5%.
Uh,
and then there's the [inaudible] which is out to the,
uh,

442
00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:42.900
uh,
to,
uh,
to the east as well.
But here is again,

443
00:27:42.901 --> 00:27:46.020
I mean this is your image of the Valet Paul.
Uh,

444
00:27:46.021 --> 00:27:49.260
here you've got carriages carrying fancy people along.

445
00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.820
You have the kiosk selling newspapers.
Uh,
you have trees.

446
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:54.703
You have these,

447
00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.770
these boulevards that have been created by Oh Smuin now to be sure.

448
00:27:58.771 --> 00:28:01.890
Now there were boulevards in European cities before Rosemont,
mine.

449
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:06.720
They tended to be on the outskirts of,
uh,
of,
uh,

450
00:28:06.721 --> 00:28:11.580
of cities.
And,
and,
and they were built where there had been walls,
uh,

451
00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:16.320
military fortifications in a way replaced ramparts of their mentor and down.

452
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:19.000
The best example,
and many may have you,

453
00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:23.790
many of you may know this is Vienna with the Ring Sausa.
Uh,

454
00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:25.140
which,
um,

455
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:29.490
was a really a creation of the liberal period in Vietnamese history.

456
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:34.530
I in the 1850s and sixties and seventies,
uh,
and which,
uh,

457
00:28:34.531 --> 00:28:38.660
was on where there hadn't been fortified walls.
And in the case of Paris,
uh,

458
00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:41.490
the best example is more Parnass,
uh,

459
00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:46.380
Boulevard Mall Parnoss is on where there had been military fortifications,

460
00:28:46.381 --> 00:28:50.250
but as Paris expanded,
the fortifications had to keep being pushed out.

461
00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:54.080
So this is the boulevard,
a Masco here,
uh,

462
00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:58.200
in 1900.
Um,
and then the,

463
00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:02.160
the next one is the slide that,
that it will be a color picture.
Uh,

464
00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:07.530
and this is a piece Aros view of that same,
um,
you know,
uh,

465
00:29:07.531 --> 00:29:11.640
of that have that same boulevard.
And My,
my great friend Bob Herbert,

466
00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:16.650
the fantastic a social historian of art actually found the place where a Beazer

467
00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:20.940
are,
was looking out the window to,
to,
uh,
to do this.
But,
but here again,
I mean,

468
00:29:20.941 --> 00:29:25.430
it's an obvious theme,
but,
uh,
you know,
the light and the movement of,
uh,
uh,

469
00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:29.190
in the first painting,
what strikes you?
At the first glance,

470
00:29:29.191 --> 00:29:33.870
a Paris was really,
uh,
the Paris of the boulevards were,
were really made for,

471
00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.360
uh,
uh,
for the impressionist paintings.

472
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:41.460
And the only working class impressionist painter was when,
wow.
Uh,
and it was,
wow,

473
00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:45.550
my quarter,
uh,
the other day who started out as a porcelain painter and limos,

474
00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:47.800
a painting porcelain.
Uh,
and it was,

475
00:29:47.801 --> 00:29:52.150
he that said that these boulevards reminded him of his soldiers lined up for

476
00:29:52.151 --> 00:29:54.130
review.
Again.
I mean,

477
00:29:54.131 --> 00:29:58.230
that's not a bad description of the imperialism of the straight line,
but the,

478
00:29:58.231 --> 00:30:02.200
the,
it was these boulevards and its commerce and as wealthy people that,
that,
uh,

479
00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:06.700
the anarchist so much,
Hayden,
um,
and again,
here,

480
00:30:06.701 --> 00:30:10.720
this is a applause.
And,
and,
and this is through this intro of queer people that,

481
00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.660
that,
that know something about impressionist painting.
Uh,

482
00:30:13.661 --> 00:30:17.640
this became an impressionist painting a,
and I didn't get to slide,
um,

483
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:20.850
uh,
kind of an important,
uh,

484
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:24.310
street or intersection because,
uh,

485
00:30:24.311 --> 00:30:29.110
the impressionists collector and painter Chi booked,
uh,
did his Paris,

486
00:30:29.111 --> 00:30:33.730
uh,
you know,
the effect of the rain,
uh,
where he has a bourgeois couples,

487
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.020
uh,
crossing the street near each other,
but,
uh,
but,

488
00:30:38.021 --> 00:30:42.970
but having nothing in common with each other,
part of the anatomy of,

489
00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:47.350
you know,
of the city.
Uh,
and it was a statement about the sort of self,

490
00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:52.450
self,
self importance of the,
of the middle class and Sigma Chi books.

491
00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:57.820
Other paintings involve,
uh,
views from balconies in which the person is the,

492
00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:01.900
the viewer or the,
the,
the main subject of the painting is isolated from,

493
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:06.940
you know,
from ordinary people who might walk around a below I and you can,

494
00:31:06.941 --> 00:31:09.550
you know,
you can over emphasize this themes do too much,

495
00:31:09.551 --> 00:31:13.600
but it's still worth keeping in mind.
But,
but here you have your,
your,
you know,

496
00:31:13.601 --> 00:31:16.390
your basic impressionist landscape.
Uh,

497
00:31:16.391 --> 00:31:21.250
and it was very much a creation of their building of Paris in the 1850s and

498
00:31:21.251 --> 00:31:25.790
sixties urban landscape.
So,
uh,
again,
I mean,
this is,
this is a,

499
00:31:25.791 --> 00:31:28.180
a great example of the way in which,
you know,

500
00:31:28.181 --> 00:31:32.700
not all boulevards were created by the [inaudible],
uh,
in Paris.

501
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:36.370
Some,
as I suggested a few minutes ago,
uh,

502
00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:41.000
followed the roots of the walls.
And here's the best example one could pick.
Uh,

503
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:45.610
this was at the time of the French revolution.
Uh,
the,
the city limits,

504
00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:50.300
um,
eh,
the,
the two gates like this,
uh,
we're called the port,

505
00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:54.940
the port to sound the knee and the,
uh,
um,
uh,
uh,

506
00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:59.610
pull to up a pastime or settler.
I was just going to,
but anyway,
uh,

507
00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:03.520
it was through a seminar town,
the port Soundmark town.
And,
um,

508
00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:06.790
it was when Louie the 16th and Marie Antoinette,
uh,
uh,

509
00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:11.120
tried to escape an improbably disguised as retainers for some,
you know,

510
00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:14.530
wealthy Bareness.
Uh,
they were able to get through this,

511
00:32:14.531 --> 00:32:18.600
this particular gate because the,
uh,
the,
the guards were bullied.

512
00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:24.060
They were all drunk from,
uh,
having been in a wedding.
Um,
and then,
uh,

513
00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:28.180
what the,
the tax collected and what you brought,
you brought into the city,

514
00:32:28.181 --> 00:32:29.590
passed right through this gate.

515
00:32:29.591 --> 00:32:31.690
You had to pay a tax on what you brought into the city.

516
00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:33.670
More about that in a minute.

517
00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:38.170
But you can see that these boulevards become extensions of,
uh,

518
00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.700
become extensions of,
uh,
uh,

519
00:32:40.701 --> 00:32:43.370
these walls that had once been there.

520
00:32:43.371 --> 00:32:47.620
And in the case of the Port San Marta and the Potter and the knee,
uh,

521
00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:52.400
they are still there.
And of course the ports done.
The knee is going north to,
uh,

522
00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:56.180
to the cathedral town of Santa near village of [inaudible],
which be,

523
00:32:56.181 --> 00:32:59.300
or small town,
which became a,
a,
an important,
uh,

524
00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:04.490
senator of were working class a production and subsequently of anarchism

525
00:33:04.671 --> 00:33:09.150
socialism and ultimately communism.
More about that in a minute.
Now,
I,

526
00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:12.230
you still have traditional work done in Paris.
As I suggested,

527
00:33:12.231 --> 00:33:16.190
we were talking about the garment industry and there's still had cases where the

528
00:33:16.191 --> 00:33:21.170
father is literally the foreman and his family is working for him.
Uh,

529
00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:24.710
you know,
through sub contracting,
people working,
uh,

530
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:29.000
working at what was a rather large,
uh,
you know,
this is an act lea.

531
00:33:29.001 --> 00:33:31.010
This is not their,
their,
their home.
Uh,

532
00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:35.430
well you've got pots and things hanging around a big roof.
Um,

533
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:36.351
but anyway,

534
00:33:36.351 --> 00:33:40.580
in it's in the eastern part of Paris and in the northeastern and north and in

535
00:33:40.581 --> 00:33:45.380
the suburbs that you've got the conversion of old buildings into industrial

536
00:33:45.381 --> 00:33:48.640
production and you have new,
uh,

537
00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:53.270
you have a new industries perched on the edge of the city.

538
00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.600
And this is the room,
uh,
the full bowl of Sand Antoine,

539
00:33:56.601 --> 00:33:59.450
which at the time of the French Revolution was beyond the busty.

540
00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.730
And it was lots of these people who are cabinet workers,
uh,

541
00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:05.480
who have storm the busty in the best deal in,

542
00:34:05.481 --> 00:34:09.980
in 1789.
Um,
but again,

543
00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:11.750
the contrast between center and periphery.

544
00:34:11.751 --> 00:34:15.950
This is a somewhat sympathetic but also a little bit condescending.

545
00:34:15.951 --> 00:34:20.720
Look at popular sociability in these cabaret that I talked about the other day,

546
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.960
uh,
on the edge of,
uh,
the perception,

547
00:34:23.961 --> 00:34:28.620
the middleclass perception of the drunk and commoner perched on the edge of,
uh,

548
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:33.530
urban life on the margins of urban life,
uh,
drinking it up.

549
00:34:33.890 --> 00:34:36.280
And,
and these are really great.
This is a,

550
00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:41.630
here I put these next to in simply to show you the difference between our give

551
00:34:41.871 --> 00:34:44.120
you images of the differences between the,

552
00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:48.830
what happens to the western districts of Paris on the edge and those of the

553
00:34:48.831 --> 00:34:52.980
east.
Now this is,
this is the east,
uh,

554
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:57.700
on the very edge.
And uh,
uh,
these are so rural looking houses,
you know,

555
00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:01.490
was slanted roofs like that.
This is the laundry of combat.

556
00:35:01.491 --> 00:35:05.930
So this is a real kind of socialist image from the,
uh,
the turn of the century.

557
00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:09.860
Uh,
this has gotta be right before World War One.
How do we know that?
Um,

558
00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:14.980
because this is something of the May 12 and the first metro opened along the Sin

559
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:20.270
Paralleling the sin,
uh,
on July 14th,
1900 four,

560
00:35:20.271 --> 00:35:20.961
the exhibition,

561
00:35:20.961 --> 00:35:23.690
it's now the line that goes to the [inaudible] phones all the way out to vest

562
00:35:23.691 --> 00:35:27.950
then,
uh,
to the east.
And then the lines were subsequently extended out.

563
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:32.630
So,
uh,
this is probably about 1912 and 1913.
Uh,

564
00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.820
but this is still a kind of a,
this is the,

565
00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:39.880
these are a industrial suburbs that have been created by both,

566
00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:44.400
uh,
you know,
the industrial glomeration of Paris,

567
00:35:44.401 --> 00:35:46.860
the availability of land and have,
uh,

568
00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:51.640
of capital on the outside of Paris and of,
uh,
uh,
of,

569
00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:54.690
of a workforce of a very transient,
uh,

570
00:35:54.691 --> 00:35:57.000
but still a massive workforce there.

571
00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:01.590
And then if we go off in the other direction on the edge of this would be what

572
00:36:01.591 --> 00:36:04.800
the equivalent now as of the 17th or own these small,
I reversed this,

573
00:36:04.801 --> 00:36:08.150
but it doesn't make this size,
but a difference.
You see that this is a,
you know,

574
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:12.750
this,
this building is,
is,
you know,
sort of a solidly,
uh,
artists will,

575
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:17.820
uh,
uh,
Laura Middleclass building,
uh,
that,
um,
uh,

576
00:36:17.821 --> 00:36:20.650
you know,
that reflects the fact that in many ways,
uh,

577
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:25.620
the western half of Paris and including even the western periphery was,

578
00:36:25.621 --> 00:36:30.220
uh,
uh,
was,
uh,
was,
was very different.
Um,
I mean,
I,

579
00:36:30.221 --> 00:36:32.160
I say that with,
with,
uh,
some,
uh,
I mean,

580
00:36:32.161 --> 00:36:35.520
once you get the image that all the suburbs in the west were like zero Psi

581
00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:39.630
Argent arch.
And Toy,
for example,
five people broke into the museum,

582
00:36:39.631 --> 00:36:42.600
they'll say over the weekend,
and for some whatever reason,
they're all drunk up,

583
00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:47.730
poked a big hole in,
in and Monet's great.
Uh,
uh,
the bridge at Arjun toy painting,

584
00:36:47.731 --> 00:36:51.820
which is really kind of a amazing damage.
But Arjun,
ty was a place where,
uh,

585
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:56.520
you had,
you had leisure,
you had sailboats,
you had people of means a,

586
00:36:56.521 --> 00:36:58.920
you no longer had vineyards at all.
Uh,

587
00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:02.910
but you also had industry and Monet,
the painter,
Claude Monet,

588
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:06.170
his depictions of Arjun Toy.
Uh,
uh,

589
00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:09.660
you have the smoke stacks become just part of the scene.

590
00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:13.930
It's a very neutral kind of look at,
at smokestacks of it.

591
00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:16.140
Not clearly differentiated even from,
you know,

592
00:37:16.141 --> 00:37:20.330
from these sailboats are in the regattas and all of that.
But,
but Monet,

593
00:37:20.331 --> 00:37:23.370
and it's my friend Bob Herbert who pointed this out,
um,
won't even,

594
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:26.370
he lives at ours and tie.
He gets tired of that.

595
00:37:26.371 --> 00:37:30.290
He gets tired of kind of the contradictions of,
of,
you know,
of,

596
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:34.860
of capitalism and industrialization.
And,
and,
and he longs for this,
uh,

597
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:39.620
uh,
this,
this nonurban,
uh,
uh,
pay Sij this law,

598
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:43.560
non urban scenes to pain.
And what does he do?
As you all know,

599
00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:47.390
he moves to Giovanni is given a knee along the,
uh,
uh,

600
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:51.780
along the sin and a railroad track runs right through his back,

601
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:56.190
his backyard.
And he never paints it.
Not once.

602
00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:01.000
What he does is he creates this kind of,
uh,
this kind of idyllic,
uh,
uh,

603
00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:05.250
rural scene of,
you know,
lily pads and ponds and,
and,
uh,

604
00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:07.830
it's a wonderful experience to go there if you're not trampled by that,
you know,

605
00:38:07.831 --> 00:38:09.280
40,000 tourists,
uh,

606
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:12.540
you can imagine this is someplace where someone lived and ran up and down the

607
00:38:12.541 --> 00:38:14.580
stairs and had fun and,
and,
uh,

608
00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:18.910
and then went out and got away from this industry of ours origin toy.
Uh,

609
00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:22.380
but anyway,
he was moving on to a different stage.

610
00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:28.260
And so what you,
you know,
what you get on,
on the edge of Paris?

611
00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:33.500
I is,
uh,
uh,
and the West is this,
this is the avenue of the grown to Almay.

612
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:37.240
So this is beyond the Arc de Triomphe.

613
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:42.330
And now this is going out to New York,
which is a,
you know,
a very,
uh,

614
00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:45.730
right on the edge of the water balloon,
which was a,
I became a very,

615
00:38:45.731 --> 00:38:50.230
very prosperous,
uh,
uh,
a suburban certainly still is.
That's it,
that's for sure.

616
00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:52.230
Um,
and,
uh,

617
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.340
what you had on the other side of the east was very different and the north and

618
00:38:55.341 --> 00:38:57.880
northeast was,
was,
was,
it was extremely different.

619
00:38:57.881 --> 00:39:02.380
It wasn't like that at all.
And so what happens,

620
00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:05.860
um,
when you,
you know,

621
00:39:05.861 --> 00:39:10.861
the images that I showed you before of those big arcs of triumph that in which

622
00:39:12.071 --> 00:39:13.110
you,
uh,

623
00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:18.180
which I said the king had escaped through trying to get out of France during the

624
00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:19.930
French revolution.
Um,

625
00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:24.380
and I said that you paid on what you brought in and just,
you know,

626
00:39:24.381 --> 00:39:27.940
in conclusion for the last seven minutes,
I'm going to talk a little bit about,

627
00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:29.860
uh,
a theme that's rather interesting.

628
00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:34.860
And that's why European suburbs are so different than American suburbs.

629
00:39:35.201 --> 00:39:38.220
More about that in a minute.
But,
um,
the,

630
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:43.180
the walls around Paris when they lost their military purposes,

631
00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.820
still had a fiscal purpose,

632
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:51.030
which was to provide a means of collecting taxes on what you brought in to town.

633
00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:58.450
And this wall or this taxing apparatus is called in French,

634
00:39:58.451 --> 00:40:02.140
the Oak Trois Oct Roi.

635
00:40:02.141 --> 00:40:06.160
And I love these little buildings.
You can see some at,
uh,
on the,
uh,

636
00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:10.870
in your necio and pleasant enough show you and the other cop cow and a lot,

637
00:40:10.871 --> 00:40:12.190
there's a fantastic one.
I mean,

638
00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:14.440
seem all over the places and they're just beautiful.

639
00:40:14.441 --> 00:40:17.470
Sometimes people live in them,
but this,
but this last,

640
00:40:17.471 --> 00:40:20.260
this isn't something that disappeared in 1850 or 1900.

641
00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.710
It lasts till World War Two.
And that's,

642
00:40:23.711 --> 00:40:28.540
that's the big way that municipalities were able to raise any money at all since

643
00:40:28.541 --> 00:40:31.330
basically wealthy people didn't pay taxes.
Uh,

644
00:40:31.331 --> 00:40:35.500
and that's why it's a very regressive tax.
It's like a huge super sales tax.

645
00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:38.560
And Francis,
nothing was not full of regressive taxes.
Uh,

646
00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:40.900
since the value added tax is 21%.

647
00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:44.990
And on electronics and stuff like that is 33%.
So,
uh,

648
00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:47.140
you're taxed on what you buy and sell.
It's poor.

649
00:40:47.141 --> 00:40:49.160
People have left less money to buy things.
It's,

650
00:40:49.161 --> 00:40:51.680
it really is a totally unfair but,

651
00:40:51.681 --> 00:40:54.850
but the origins of the system is in the [inaudible] and this is one of those are

652
00:40:54.851 --> 00:40:59.440
actually fairly rare photos that I know of of what it was like in your sort of

653
00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:02.820
divulge Joss,
your coach here.
This is called an [inaudible] out.

654
00:41:02.821 --> 00:41:04.640
It was people wrote on the top and,

655
00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:09.580
and you're leaving Paris or you entering Paris.
It doesn't matter at all.

656
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:14.670
But the point is that you were controlled day or night when you went through and

657
00:41:15.851 --> 00:41:20.380
on the edge of Paris is a,
are created the,
these,

658
00:41:20.381 --> 00:41:23.630
these working class industrial suburbs,
uh,

659
00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:28.800
that are feared by the center and during the 1920s and 1930s become major

660
00:41:32.231 --> 00:41:36.230
sources of support for the Communist Party.
I,
because people,

661
00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:39.620
most of the people will live there,
were extremely badly lodged.

662
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:42.300
And the Communists do very well because of the model look,

663
00:41:42.301 --> 00:41:47.301
t that has people who are badly lodged and they provide services to poor working

664
00:41:48.621 --> 00:41:52.970
families that,
and other municipalities simply one did not have.

665
00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.640
And if you go to something like the fact that in many ta,

666
00:41:55.641 --> 00:42:00.220
which is the big communist party,
every year,
a big boom,
a big guy,

667
00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:04.040
which means a big,
big party,
you know,
with full of speeches and all of that,

668
00:42:04.041 --> 00:42:07.550
you could kind of go from one booth and have your oysters and the Feeney stair

669
00:42:07.551 --> 00:42:11.660
booth and then go have paya and the [inaudible] booth,
and then,
uh,
you know,

670
00:42:11.661 --> 00:42:14.480
have goat's cheese and the l dash booth,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

671
00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:19.730
And Beaujolais and the,
and the,
uh,
in the hone booth,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
Uh,

672
00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.800
but,
but the association between,

673
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:26.360
between working class people on the edge of a,

674
00:42:26.361 --> 00:42:30.110
on the margins of the big city,
uh,

675
00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:34.730
and radical politics is terribly important in the twenties and thirties.

676
00:42:34.731 --> 00:42:38.180
And even much later than that.
Um,
and this is a,

677
00:42:38.181 --> 00:42:40.370
a town called [inaudible],

678
00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:45.580
which is north of Paris and they all have streets called something like the

679
00:42:45.681 --> 00:42:49.090
rumor he's tall,
has,
who was a mining a minor,
who was a leader,

680
00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:53.150
a leader of the Communist Party following the dictates of Moscow.
Alas,

681
00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:57.080
in the 19,
um,
uh,
in the 1930s,

682
00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:01.640
many of them still have an avenue,
genre has,
uh,
for obvious reasons,
reasons,

683
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:04.840
but so,
but this is this,
the growth of all of,
of the,

684
00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:08.600
of these industrial suburbs that is one of the important,
uh,

685
00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.240
sort of concomitance of,
uh,

686
00:43:11.241 --> 00:43:16.160
of large scale industrialization and the identification of the urban periphery

687
00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.930
with industrial work,

688
00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:21.800
I mean many of the so called dirty industries chemical production.

689
00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:26.380
So production things that smell are forced out of the center,
uh,

690
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:29.570
and onto the periphery.
And so that's where the factories are.

691
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:33.320
That's where the cheapest labor is to be found more about this.

692
00:43:33.321 --> 00:43:34.071
And just a second,

693
00:43:34.071 --> 00:43:38.930
and just to finish this off with a Monet of Arjun tie again,

694
00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.480
and this one does,
it's not the poem ours and tell you if I had a time,

695
00:43:41.481 --> 00:43:42.980
it would have gone to get that one.
The painting,

696
00:43:42.981 --> 00:43:47.720
it was just a rip by vandals over the weekend.
Uh,
but,
uh,
again,

697
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:48.950
the extension of,

698
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:53.750
of the sort of prosperity to the West is obviously the Norman coast because

699
00:43:53.751 --> 00:43:56.510
they're pretty with a turbo trains are already going to the northern coast.

700
00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:00.560
Deauville is not far away a Choctaw,
uh,
uh,
you know,

701
00:44:00.561 --> 00:44:02.180
and these kinds of places are there.

702
00:44:02.181 --> 00:44:07.170
And so that's an extension of this west East,
uh,
a dichotomy,
uh,
in that,

703
00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:10.170
that people from eastern Paris or from the northern suburbs are not going to

704
00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:12.170
[inaudible] for the weekend.
They're not.

705
00:44:12.171 --> 00:44:15.680
The kind of people are going to be painted by Beth Kimonti zone.
Uh,
uh,

706
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:19.850
but so the spatial concomitants are aspects even,
you know,
continue to,

707
00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:23.660
is for the planting of the Parisian flag on the Norman coast.
And again,

708
00:44:23.661 --> 00:44:27.580
that's a subject for another excellent book,
uh,
by my friend,
uh,

709
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:30.260
Bob Herbert.
Now I want to get the finish off.

710
00:44:30.261 --> 00:44:34.020
I want to get somewhere more light so I can see you all.
Um,

711
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.440
um,
how to do this,
how to do this in five minutes.

712
00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:40.590
I will do this in the following way.
In 1991,

713
00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:46.290
was it 1991 or 1992 at the time of the Rodney King riots does that,
1992,

714
00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:51.580
um,
uh,
Rodney king was a,
an Afro American and lay in La.

715
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:56.390
And the police basically just beat the hell out of him.
I,
and,
uh,
there's a there,

716
00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:00.220
they're acquitted and it,
it led to some,
uh,
very,
uh,

717
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:04.920
very difficult times in,
in Los Angeles with,
with lots of riots and,
and,
and,
uh,

718
00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:10.200
uh,
lots of anger.
And we were doing a bunch of us,
uh,
an edited book on,

719
00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:14.440
uh,
on the red suburbs,
on precisely this,
in,
in,

720
00:45:14.441 --> 00:45:18.390
in working class suburbs in they're sort of identification with radical
politics.

721
00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:22.860
And people in France kept asking me,
they couldn't understand the concept of,

722
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:28.430
of wealthy suburbs and impoverished people,

723
00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:33.360
minorities living in the center of cities and find the weed.

724
00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:36.060
They stopped even press.
Well,
I could write something and not kill of me,

725
00:45:36.061 --> 00:45:37.110
but I just,
Reno wrote something,

726
00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:41.860
an epilogue trying to explain why it is that in Europe things are different now.

727
00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:45.180
I,
I,
and it's not entirely so after,

728
00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:49.110
after all [inaudible] was a suburb in the early 1830s,

729
00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:52.140
one of the ministers of Louis Felipe went to him and said,
sir,

730
00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:56.340
if these factories that you are allowing the prefect of police to tolerate on

731
00:45:56.341 --> 00:46:00.150
the edge of the city will be the core that rings are net one day.

732
00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:05.520
Fear of the periphery,
not fear of,
of the center.
Uh,

733
00:46:05.521 --> 00:46:08.430
in 1831 and 1834,
[inaudible] the,

734
00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:13.560
the suburb of the Qua who's the soap workers pour down the hill down the hill,

735
00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:17.220
defending their rights with scientists,
had live free and die fighting.

736
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:22.380
And the middleclass national guard set up their guns to right at the edge of the

737
00:46:22.381 --> 00:46:26.190
city,
uh,
to keep the suburban people from invading the center.

738
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.210
That's very,
very different,
isn't it?
Lee?
Moshe,
same thing.
They put up barricades,

739
00:46:30.211 --> 00:46:34.680
the workers in the suburbs,
the differentiate their space with,
with the center.

740
00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:39.550
Uh,
it is amazing.
Amazing kinds of continuity.
The,
the,
these,

741
00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:44.850
these sort of mutual fears in Detroit in 1968 when I was a kid,

742
00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:49.890
uh,
there was a 1967 I went to a tiger game and we came out of the tiger game

743
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:54.950
doubleheader with the Yankees and the city was on fire and it was the riots of

744
00:46:55.501 --> 00:46:59.460
Detroit.
And much of Detroit is still decimated,
has never recovered from that,

745
00:46:59.461 --> 00:47:02.880
never despite the Renaissance Center and the occasional success of the tigers

746
00:47:02.881 --> 00:47:05.850
and all good things like that.
And one of the,

747
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:11.030
of the suburbs of Detroit tried at 1.2 to change the street patterns so that

748
00:47:11.311 --> 00:47:12.144
they,

749
00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:16.200
that is the poor people from the center could not come out to gross point or

750
00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:20.430
Farmington hills or one of those elegant places.
And I remember that very,

751
00:47:20.431 --> 00:47:24.630
very vividly.
Now,
why did that all happen?
Y and we talk in two years ago,

752
00:47:24.631 --> 00:47:27.360
we had all these big riots in,
in,
in,
in,
in France,
in the,

753
00:47:27.361 --> 00:47:31.630
in the suburbs and began in clichy soup Wa and you know,
all over the place.

754
00:47:31.631 --> 00:47:33.520
I mean,
some were exaggerated and all of that.

755
00:47:33.521 --> 00:47:37.420
And Sarcozi spun it out of control by calling them scum that people live in the

756
00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:41.320
periphery.
They're scum rack rack guy is exist,

757
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:45.680
the guy and all this stuff.
It's just,
it was,
it was just the policy.
Uh,

758
00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:49.090
how did this happen?
You know,
what happened is that the,

759
00:47:49.091 --> 00:47:50.740
that people unwanted by the center,

760
00:47:50.741 --> 00:47:55.741
we're in creating [inaudible] was part of this rejected toward the outside where

761
00:47:56.260 --> 00:48:00.050
with the,
you know,
the dilapidation of,
of American Center cities,

762
00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:04.570
a good part of Philadelphia did most of Detroit,
I mean New Orleans,
New Orleans,

763
00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:06.460
uh,
San Francisco and you know,

764
00:48:06.461 --> 00:48:10.120
Beacon Hill and put when we can find exceptions to that,

765
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:13.260
but the pattern's just completely different.
You had the Vietnamese,
uh,

766
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:17.290
army firing,
you know,
large shells at the working class,

767
00:48:17.291 --> 00:48:22.180
suburbs at the housing,
uh,
working class housing on the outside of the city.

768
00:48:22.181 --> 00:48:24.730
It's just the opposite.
When you think of suburbs,
uh,

769
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:28.420
you don't just think of Darienne or you don't just think of gross point or

770
00:48:28.421 --> 00:48:33.350
Hillsborough,
California or,
uh,
you know,
very fancy places,
uh,

771
00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:36.780
in other places.
But I mean,
it's,
it's very different.
The F,

772
00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:41.290
it's a pattern is just the opposite.
It's an incredible difference.
And when,

773
00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:43.180
can't exaggerate this too much,
but,

774
00:48:43.181 --> 00:48:47.410
but these spatial tensions count for something.
And,
and,
uh,
you know,

775
00:48:47.411 --> 00:48:49.030
the margins of urban life in,

776
00:48:49.031 --> 00:48:52.510
in France and a particularly around Paris were really,
uh,
the,

777
00:48:52.511 --> 00:48:57.490
the periphery became the,
uh,
uh,
became the domain of people who,
uh,

778
00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.590
who really couldn't afford to live in the center.

779
00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:03.430
And that's an increasing problem in Paris today is one neighborhood after

780
00:49:03.431 --> 00:49:05.680
another becomes more and more expensive.

781
00:49:05.681 --> 00:49:10.590
Now it's 11th and 12th are out of control.
The 13th is audit control.
And,
uh,

782
00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:12.550
3 million people may live in Paris,

783
00:49:12.551 --> 00:49:16.780
but you've got another 8,000 people living in this urban agglomeration and

784
00:49:16.781 --> 00:49:19.300
creating these attempted cities that are gonna,

785
00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:22.630
that are gonna be magnitude of their own.
It's been an utter,
utter failure.

786
00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:26.830
But when almost mine was really part of that,
and,
and,
and,
uh,
uh,

787
00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:30.190
people building factories seek a labor force,
they seek more space.

788
00:49:30.191 --> 00:49:33.190
They want to have their factories outside of the customs barrier,

789
00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:37.750
so they're not paying taxes on what they bring in to use in their factory.

790
00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:43.020
So that's just a very short explanation for why European cities and European

791
00:49:43.481 --> 00:49:47.450
suburbs in particular,
the whole sense of a suburb.
Uh,
you know,

792
00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:51.370
despite the kind of poverty,
all of a Remy Central,
a Samurai Raimi,

793
00:49:51.371 --> 00:49:53.440
they show videos and places like that.
Uh,

794
00:49:53.441 --> 00:49:56.440
and there was a wealthier parts of the other Parisian periphery.

795
00:49:56.750 --> 00:50:00.760
There's still a contrast there.
And even the image,
when you say you're in French,

796
00:50:00.761 --> 00:50:04.210
you say,
ah,
you know,
you come from the capto vans because you come from 93,

797
00:50:04.211 --> 00:50:07.480
that means since then the knee and that it for them that that's the image of the

798
00:50:07.481 --> 00:50:11.590
93 license plate is that the of the periphery,
uh,
of,

799
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:14.560
of people who are thought to be marginal by the center.

800
00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:18.430
But as I've argued in other places,
including some of my own writing,

801
00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:23.640
the sense of not belonging to the center creates a type of solidarity that

802
00:50:23.861 --> 00:50:27.710
helped the communist in the 1920s and thirties.
And,
and,
and hopefully people,

803
00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:30.140
you know,
as the government is undercut the temps of,
of,

804
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:33.350
of suburban people to create voluntary associations that will,

805
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:37.580
we'll offer hope to all these people.
Wait Til your watch to the end,
you know,

806
00:50:37.581 --> 00:50:41.620
the film,
uh,
later on.
It's incredible.
Well,
some of this starts with those mine.

807
00:50:41.621 --> 00:50:46.200
We went along way today from the l station until all the way to clichy,
uh,
uh,

808
00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:50.630
why,
uh,
uh,
two years ago.
But I hope that the larger points were clear.

809
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:55.670
And from that,
we move on to,
uh,
to imperialism on Monday.

810
00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:58.000
I have a fantastic weekend.
See you.
