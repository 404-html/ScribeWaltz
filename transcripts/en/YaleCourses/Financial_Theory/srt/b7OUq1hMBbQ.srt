1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,240
So we have begun by talking
about general equilibrium.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,010
And uh,

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,760
this was the background to the
course so that you're all familiar.

4
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:16,230
Those of you who haven't taken freshman
economics or intermediate economics,

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,440
what's the background that's
required for the course and the,

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,970
the fact that general equilibrium
is a part of finances. As I say,

7
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:30,570
a bit of an innovation because most
finance courses are taught entirely

8
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:32,910
independently of economic theory.

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,680
But the two greatest Yale economist and
two greatest Yale financial economists

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,310
have had financing economics integrated.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,010
And I believe that's the only right
way of looking at the problem.

12
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:45,510
And as I said at the very beginning,

13
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,570
I think the events of the last few
years have confirmed that view.

14
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,670
So let's take up the question today of
why is the free market supposedly so

15
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:56,670
good?
So we worked out two examples last time.

16
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,130
The first example was,

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,450
and the two examples are very similar to
the first problem set that you did. Uh,

18
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:06,600
in the first example, you've
got two agents, a and B.

19
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,380
And whenever we write agency and B,
we really mean a million agents,

20
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:12,000
just like a in a million agents.

21
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:15,840
Just like be the heart of perfect
competition and the economies that there's

22
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:20,160
lots of people and so we can't,
yeah,

23
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,300
I think it's all right from now, from
now on. And I'm going to be in the glass.

24
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,820
So from,
so the,

25
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:30,090
so we meet a million people of type
A and a million people have type B.

26
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:31,590
So the utility function of a,

27
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,620
the welfare function of age written
there and the welfare function of bees

28
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:37,540
written and each begin with endowments.
Uh,

29
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,110
so when these 2 million
people come together,

30
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,590
they're going to be doing the same
thing that you saw in the class.

31
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:45,180
And the first day they're
going to be trying.

32
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:49,080
There can be haggling and arguing and the,
the buyers are gonna always say,

33
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:51,900
the stuff's not worth very much
and why should they pay so much?

34
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,900
And the sellers are going to say it's
worth a tremendous amount and they should

35
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:57,900
pay even more. And eventually
they're going to come to prices.

36
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:03,230
And we discovered last time that the
way of describing what prices and what

37
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:07,590
final allocations, they come to us by
writing down a system of equations.

38
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:11,520
And you did that all in your homework.
And we came up with this outcome.

39
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,280
So similarly, we did another problem
in the last class and we wrote down,

40
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,241
uh,
you know,

41
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:22,140
different welfare functions or utility
functions and different endowments.

42
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:23,460
And again,
we've got the equilibrium.

43
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,260
So he said that one of the amazing
things is that the system of equations,

44
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:33,261
the six equations for each economy
that you solved in class always have a

45
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:34,670
solution. So the, the,

46
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,270
the people who discovered that
discovered it at the Coles Foundation,

47
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:41,490
they were Ken Arrow.
Um,

48
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,240
Gerard Debreu was a yellow
system professor, Ken Arrow,

49
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,550
who's visiting the cold
foundation in Chicago,

50
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:51,230
but it was a Stanford professor
and, and, uh, Lionel Mckenzie,

51
00:02:51,231 --> 00:02:55,260
who actually taught at Rochester the
economic equations always have a solution.

52
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,070
So what's so good about that
economic solution, Adam Smith,

53
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,110
about the invisible hand,
but you know,

54
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:05,410
there was no mathematics in an Adam Smith.

55
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:09,610
So why do we think equilibrium
is such a good thing after all,

56
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:14,110
you saw in the example that there were
three pairs of people who for Lauren Lee

57
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:18,210
couldn't trade it all.
So clearly not everybody gets to trade.

58
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:20,470
Discrimination happens.
Some people get the stuff,

59
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:25,060
other people don't get the stuff. Well,
the first approach of economists, uh,

60
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,950
was that equilibrium maximizes
the sum of utilities.

61
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,200
So let's see how that works in,

62
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,530
in this example.

63
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:47,950
So this example is very special because
everybody thinks that the good why has

64
00:03:48,351 --> 00:03:50,240
constant margin utility of one.

65
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,750
So that's going to play a big role in
our optimization in maximizing the sum of

66
00:03:55,941 --> 00:03:58,850
utilities. So if you want to
maximize the sum of utilities,

67
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,950
you want to maximize the sell. If
utilities, you have to maximize,

68
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,330
um,
a hundred x,

69
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:13,331
say minus one half x squared plus
30 X v minus one half x v Square,

70
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,820
uh,
squared.

71
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,733
Yeah.

72
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,760
Okay. Uh, plus, let's put
it at the end. Why a plus?

73
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:30,910
Why B? Hey, such that,

74
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,200
okay,

75
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,880
x plus x B equals 84,

76
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,080
which is the sum of four and 80.
And why a plus?

77
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,660
Why B equals 6,000?

78
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,940
So the claim is that if
all these 2 million people
meeting their meet in a room

79
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:53,750
like this and start shouting at each
other and trading and offering deals and

80
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:57,440
stuff, it's going to come down to a final
allocation which we've written over.

81
00:04:57,441 --> 00:05:02,000
There were a gets 77 of the first good
and B get seven of the first good,

82
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,080
and that final allocation is going
to maximize the sum of utilities.

83
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,980
So why should that be the case? In fact,
in this example, it is the case. Well,

84
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:14,900
why is it the case? Because there's
constant margin utility of y.

85
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,230
So we don't have to worry about
the why allocation at all.

86
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,470
Because if you increase
why AA and decreased,

87
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:26,471
why be they still have to add up to
6,000 you're going to be lowering A's

88
00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:29,780
utility and raising bees
utility by the same amount.

89
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,910
So you won't have changed
the sum of utilities.

90
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:36,410
So the whys are totally irrelevant to
this maximizing the sum of utilities.

91
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,600
So all you have to do is make sure that
the x allocation maximize the sum of

92
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:43,040
utilities for the good acts.

93
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:44,390
Okay?

94
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:49,390
So that you can see must
be the case because we can,

95
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,840
we have to maximize the sum
of two people's utilities
are 2 million utilities.

96
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,530
You can always plug in.
X B is a function of x,

97
00:05:58,531 --> 00:06:02,570
a name we 84 so let's write
it as a function of x day.

98
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,060
Okay? And we can replace this
maximization by replay by,

99
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,990
by recognizing that Xb is just
a function of x. Say okay.

100
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:18,050
In fact, it's a very special
function where the derivative effect

101
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,640
speed with respect to x say
so let's call the function,

102
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:26,660
we'll call it that to denote that it's
a function happens in equal minus one.

103
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,790
Okay?
So we want to maximize this over x.

104
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:36,490
Say taking into account that
Xb is just a function of Axa.

105
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,640
Cause if we can't get to maximize,
you have to keep feasible.

106
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,400
So we've now ignored all the constraints.

107
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,340
Constraints have now disappeared.

108
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,510
Provided we keep track of the fact
that Xb is a function of x. Say,

109
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:51,771
okay,

110
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:56,771
so why is it the case that the
equilibrium 77 and seven maximizes this?

111
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,320
Well the,
the key is right

112
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:05,320
finishing margin utility.
We know that the utility function for uh,

113
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,530
here's x utility function for a,
you know,

114
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:14,230
is quadratic. So it looks
something like that. Okay.

115
00:07:14,231 --> 00:07:17,440
And the utility function for B
also looks something like that.

116
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:22,710
And so if you look at this function
entirely as a function of a,

117
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:27,820
it's also going to look like that.
Okay? So by diminishing margin, utility,

118
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,670
mushing,
marginal utility,

119
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,290
the function,

120
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,980
the sum of utilities,

121
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,920
slum of utilities

122
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,120
is concave

123
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,430
cave.
Remember as a picture like that.

124
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,830
So what is the essence
of a picture like that?

125
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,520
It means that setting
derivative equal to zero,

126
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,493
okay?

127
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,100
You can to zero is
equivalent to implies you,

128
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,900
you are at Max.

129
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,243
Okay,

130
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,680
well that's not true of any function.
You know,

131
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:14,150
if you have a function like that
and then it goes up like that

132
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,900
can have the derivative zero here
and not really be at the Max,

133
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,020
but because there's diminishing
margin utility more and more of x,

134
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,210
there's less and less good.
So it turns down.

135
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:26,260
So all you have to do is figure
out that the derivative is zero,

136
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,290
which it is at this point.
And then you know you're at the maximum,

137
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,513
but that

138
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,720
at x equals 77 has to be the case because
if you plug in x equals 77 and you

139
00:08:37,781 --> 00:08:41,440
take the derivative of
all this with respect x a,

140
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:50,680
this whole fang taking into account
as before that XP is a function of x.

141
00:08:50,681 --> 00:08:55,590
Say you just get a hundred minus x say

142
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,650
clause.
Okay,

143
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:03,710
now it's just going to be 30 minus xb
times the derivative of XP with respect to

144
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:08,514
x.
Say

145
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,200
why is that? Because you know the
chain rule, if I differentiate,

146
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:15,930
everything goes back deck.
Say NXP is a function of x,

147
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,980
age 30 cause I'm taking
the door with a to XP,

148
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,340
so it's 30 times the drew of XP
with respect to x. Say, okay,

149
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:28,370
minus the river was right to XP is XP
times a drove XP with respect to x?

150
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:30,490
Say

151
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,290
that,

152
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:36,290
but if you plug in x equals 77 NXB
equals seven DXA DXB Dxa is minus one.

153
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:48,420
You just get 23 minus 23
equals zero because the margin
utility of a is equal to

154
00:09:49,991 --> 00:09:52,030
the margin utility in be at equilibrium.

155
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,690
The sum of utilities is maximized
and that's the end of the story.

156
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,740
So that you noticed in the problem set
something like that you may not have

157
00:09:59,741 --> 00:10:00,940
given exactly this argument.

158
00:10:00,941 --> 00:10:03,880
That was what you were supposed to have
sort of discovered in doing the problem

159
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:07,300
set and now we've confirmed what
you already pretty much knew.

160
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,020
So are there any questions about that?

161
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:13,441
Okay.

162
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:18,090
It's just the simple generalization of
our football ticket example where the

163
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:21,810
football tickets end up in the hands of
the people who want the more the most

164
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,110
and a happens to like a lot of tickets,
not just one.

165
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,410
And so a is going to keep buying tickets
until he's bought 77 of them and by

166
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:35,010
then the next football tickets and let
worth less than 23 two m B she likes

167
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:37,830
football tickets a little less.
She's not going to buy as many.

168
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,090
By the time she gets down
to a seven football tickets,

169
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,340
she's going to think I'm so,

170
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:47,460
she hasn't bought in nearly as many when
she's gotten to seven football tickets,

171
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:51,900
she's going to think the next one's worth
less than 23 and since the price is 23

172
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,260
uh, they're, they're the,
they're going to both stop there.

173
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:59,220
So they're each going to stop at the
same point with the last ticket is worth

174
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:01,920
the same to each of them and all
the previous football tickets,

175
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,660
each bod is worth more than each of them.

176
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,800
So there's no way of rearranging
the tickets. Cause if you did,

177
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:11,730
you'd have to take a football ticket
that was worth more than 23 from one of

178
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:16,020
them and give a that ticket to the other
one who buy them would think it was

179
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:18,300
worth less than 23 so that's,
that's the argument.

180
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,780
Okay.
So economists were,

181
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,750
fell were beside themselves
with their brilliance.

182
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,310
And having proved this theorem and given
a mathematical form to the invisible

183
00:11:30,311 --> 00:11:34,870
hand, whenever you take a verbal argument
like Adam Smith and turn it into a

184
00:11:34,871 --> 00:11:39,730
mathematical argument, you've understood
it better. You understand why it's true.

185
00:11:39,731 --> 00:11:43,390
And you also start to understand why in
some circumstances it might not be true.

186
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,430
So for 50 years,
let's say between 30 and 50 years,

187
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,250
this was the fundamental argument of
economics and economic equilibrium that I

188
00:11:53,251 --> 00:11:56,470
could live on was a good thing,
cause it maximize the sum of utilities.

189
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,210
But then little by little,

190
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,410
starting with Irving Fisher and a bunch
of people at the same time and a little

191
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:05,350
bit later,
so Hixon Samuelson are famous for this.

192
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,160
They began to wonder what kind of
crazy utility functions are these where

193
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:14,410
there's some mysterious God that
has constant margin utility of one.

194
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,600
So in modern terms, how could you
justify it? You could say, well,

195
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:22,400
maybe there's a machine where we,
uh,

196
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,860
can calibrate exactly how happy
people are and we can measure it.

197
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:31,780
So for example, we can measure how
much, uh, how many, how many, uh,

198
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,990
how aroused their skin is.
What would you know the, the,

199
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:39,280
the skin texture changes as you,
as you become less than more rounds.

200
00:12:39,281 --> 00:12:42,930
Maybe we could measure that. You know,
with Mris we can measure brainwaves.

201
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,000
Maybe you can calibrate
how many brainwaves were
spinning around and how happy

202
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:46,600
somebody isn't.

203
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,620
Maybe there's some mysterious good like
food that has constant margin utility.

204
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,750
Well that doesn't seem very persuasive
to me. And it wasn't to the economist.

205
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:57,520
So the beginning of the 20th century,

206
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,650
they all argued starting
with Irving Fischer that it
made no sense to think that

207
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:05,260
we could actually measure
utility and, and, and,

208
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:08,890
and more than that made even less sense
that be some good that had constant

209
00:13:08,891 --> 00:13:10,030
margin utility of one.

210
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,350
So Fisher put everything on
a symmetric footing and said,

211
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:18,220
let's think of the two goods x and
y is more or less symmetric. I mean,

212
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:20,770
there's no reason why one has
to have some special role.

213
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,590
So let's look at this equilibrium,
which we got the same way.

214
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:25,750
And you did this on a problem
set solving correct delivering.

215
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,630
Does this maximize the sum of utilities?
Well,

216
00:13:28,631 --> 00:13:33,631
the answer is if it did maximize the sum
of utilities at the final allocation,

217
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:36,820
we couldn't gain anything by switching,
you know,

218
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:40,240
reducing nine fifths a little bit and
increasing six fifths a little bit.

219
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,690
But what is the sum of utilities?
Okay,

220
00:13:43,691 --> 00:13:46,150
so if you write WIA plus WV

221
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:52,690
okay, it's going to be for one
thing, three fourths log x,

222
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:56,740
say plus.
Um,

223
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,710
two thirds log XP.

224
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:05,620
So let's look at the margin utility to EC.
Save Good.

225
00:14:05,621 --> 00:14:07,570
A,
that's three fourths.

226
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,740
So margin utility of a x plus margin
utility of B x equals three fourths times

227
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,870
one over nine fifth,
which is five ninth. Okay,

228
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,220
that equals 15 over 36,

229
00:14:24,221 --> 00:14:28,390
which is five over
18.

230
00:14:28,391 --> 00:14:31,330
If I've done that right,
it doesn't sound right. Um,

231
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,433
right.

232
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,150
512 thank you. That
sounds better. And now,

233
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,780
but let's look at the,

234
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,940
so this is the margin
utility of X. Say, okay,

235
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:51,800
is a five twelves what's
the margin utility, uh,

236
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:55,460
to be a vax? Well, n equals two thirds

237
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,290
times one over six fast,
which is five,

238
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:04,130
six a,
which is 10 over 18,

239
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:07,550
which is five over nine.
So these two numbers are different.

240
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,580
The margin utility to be
is bigger than the margin.

241
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:13,580
Utility of acts is bigger than
the margin utility. The a of x.

242
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:17,660
So clearly the final equilibrium
allocation doesn't maximize the sum of

243
00:15:17,661 --> 00:15:20,630
utilities.
By switching some goods from a to B.

244
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:25,430
You could make both people better off.
So that was a shock to economist.

245
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:29,570
It meant that the argument they'd relied
on the thing which they were using to

246
00:15:29,571 --> 00:15:32,960
persuade, you know, policy people that a,

247
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:36,500
the free markets were good thing
was a pho is a false argument.

248
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,960
It rests on a premise that's indefensible,

249
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:41,750
namely that there's constant margin
utility and everybody can measure it.

250
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,160
So they needed some other definition
of some other way of capturing the

251
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:49,610
mathematical idea that the
invisible hand is a good thing.

252
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,950
And the reason I'm spending
so much time emphasizing this,

253
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:56,030
even though you've seen this before, is
because if economist made a mistake once,

254
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,850
what makes you think they
haven't made another mistake?

255
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,620
So now let's give the argument that,
uh,

256
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,680
in a week or since the invisible hand
holds that is that the free market comes

257
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:12,770
to a very, uh, socially
desirable equilibrium.

258
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,040
And later in the course we're going to
find that their argument is also too

259
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:16,850
narrow.

260
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,850
So my point that I'm going to gradually
get to is that economists have

261
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:26,420
constantly taken too narrow and
too special view of the world.

262
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,700
And as you enlarge the view of the world,

263
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:32,240
you have not by making things
mathematically simpler, actually,

264
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,670
you have to make the mathematically
slightly more complicated.

265
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,040
As you enlarge the view
of the world you have,

266
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:40,910
you get closer to the truth and you
start to find that the free market isn't

267
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:44,140
quite as wonderful as you thought
at first. And therefore there's a,

268
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,280
there's room for government regulation.

269
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:51,430
So it's not as Paul Krugman argued
that that economists are transfixed by

270
00:16:52,941 --> 00:16:54,860
mathematics and seduced into,

271
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,760
into simple conclusions that the free
market is perfect. On the contrary,

272
00:16:58,761 --> 00:17:02,210
I would say they buy,
they were afraid of too much mathematics.

273
00:17:02,211 --> 00:17:05,780
And by looking too narrowly, they didn't
realize what they could have just by,

274
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,500
by being mathematically more
sophisticated. So it's a
failure of sophistication,

275
00:17:09,501 --> 00:17:12,290
not too much sophistication.
So what did,

276
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:16,730
what did the economists argue so that
the chief among them, Hicks, Anderson,

277
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:18,680
Paredo and Fisher,

278
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,720
all these people basically came to
the same conclusion. They said, well,

279
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,410
it makes no sense to maximize,
to talk about the sum of utilities.

280
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,120
Let's talk about predo efficiency.

281
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,440
So an allocation. So, so we began,
so what's the general problem?

282
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,440
The general problems you
start with an economy.

283
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:46,250
Okay. Made up of all these individuals,
let's call them waa and WB,

284
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,650
but it could be as many as we want.

285
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:52,890
So let's just say Wwi and II.
I,

286
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,730
so he,
I is the endowment of x and I of why.

287
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,200
So that's the economy.
And now every,

288
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,770
so you start from the economy
and you'd go to equilibrium.

289
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,100
An equilibrium is a price factor.
P X,

290
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:18,290
P Y and allocations x,
Y,

291
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,100
Aye. Aye. Aye. Such that.

292
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,593
Okay.

293
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:31,370
Summation for all the eyes of x equals
the summation for all the eyes of e X.

294
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,340
Okay. So everyone's fine. Ice
Final consumption of ax plus js,

295
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:44,800
final consumption of eggs, plus everybody
else's final consumption of eggs.

296
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,150
Those are the son of the exercise is equal
to the summer. Everybody's endowment.

297
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,980
And similarly for the wise,

298
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,270
alright, let's see, I why

299
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:03,660
and such that everybody is doing
what's in their personal interests,

300
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,130
which is maximizing. W I have x, Y,

301
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,810
z Max of Wwi.

302
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,960
Exci such that he acts a times
x Plus p y times y equals t x,

303
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:28,080
x plus B.
Why did y eat y is solved

304
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:34,500
by XII. Why? All right.

305
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,410
That's the definition of equilibrium.
Everybody individually optimizes,

306
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,560
looking at his own budget.
Set the hell with everybody else.

307
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:46,060
Does the best in his interest chooses
exci why I at the going prices?

308
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,480
Supply equals demand.
That's how you get the final allocation.

309
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,450
So that's the definition of equilibrium
and now we're trying to argue that's a

310
00:19:52,451 --> 00:19:55,480
good thing. Okay, and
so what's our criterion?

311
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,150
Well,

312
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,950
what parade on edge worth and everybody
else decided is let's look at the

313
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:06,340
welfare functions,
Waa and WB.

314
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,500
So if you take some allocation, like
the original allocation to one and one,

315
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:16,150
two you'll have a utility, a welfare
of each person. Three fourths log,

316
00:20:16,151 --> 00:20:20,220
two plus one quarter log,
one. That's the welfare bay.

317
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:24,910
And Welfare will be, will be two
thirds log, one plus one third log too.

318
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,520
So that'll be some point here.

319
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:33,850
So this is welfare.
Be Welfare,

320
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,820
a at initial endowment.

321
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,130
Okay?

322
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,720
Neutral endowment.

323
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:51,070
And if you look at the welfare at the
final allocation, so three quarters,

324
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:54,430
LogMeIn, fiscals, one portal
log, three halves, you know,

325
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:57,040
it's going to be something like this,
it's gotta be up here.

326
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,950
So it's going to be better for
both people. How do you know that?

327
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:04,790
Because a had the choice of just
buying his initial one down,

328
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,600
one that's always affordable,
and he chose not to do it.

329
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,630
He chose to do something else and he
was better off in the same with B.

330
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,230
So clearly the equilibrium allocation
is going to be better than the initial

331
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:18,670
endowment. And so the parade
or criterion Pareto criterion

332
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,820
is that, um, uh,

333
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,840
an allocation

334
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:37,190
x hat I y hat I paredo dominates

335
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,280
allocation.

336
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,720
So this is for all I
XII.

337
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,220
Let's put the eyes on the top.

338
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:55,723
Yes.

339
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,680
If and only f everybody's better off.
That'd be you.

340
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,680
I excellent.
I had,

341
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:08,930
it's bigger than w x, Y, y.

342
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:10,443
So

343
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,940
we started with an allocation,

344
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,510
the allocation here,

345
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:21,130
and then we moved to
competitive equilibrium here
and everybody may was better

346
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:21,730
off.

347
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:26,200
So the [inaudible] allocation prayed
or dominates the initial allocation.

348
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:30,310
But now the question is maybe there's
some other allocation besides the

349
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:34,060
competitive, I could live my
allocation that dominates, um,

350
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,620
that dominates the equilibrium allocation.
So this

351
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,540
CRM CRM is that

352
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,470
if p x, y,

353
00:22:48,471 --> 00:22:53,440
y I,
I and I is an,

354
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,410
uh, is a, an equilibrium

355
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,590
for the economy. The economy. He

356
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,760
remember we defined the economy.
He put he here.

357
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:14,860
Yeah.

358
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,940
Van,
no allocation.

359
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:26,170
X Hat on I y hat. All right. I am,

360
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,980
I pereno dominates.

361
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,210
All right.
So why

362
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,183
if

363
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,750
summation XII hat equals

364
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:52,250
I x
and summation,

365
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:57,590
it's got a little too tight here.
Sorry about this. Y Hat. I equals.

366
00:23:57,591 --> 00:24:01,670
This is overall y equals summation.
E I why?

367
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,060
Okay. So let's, let's,
yeah, I can read this,

368
00:24:05,061 --> 00:24:08,270
this really bad critical
line right in the corner.

369
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:13,520
So I'll just say it in words and
then read it literally. So this,

370
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,800
this allocation dominates this one.

371
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:19,010
The competitive equilibrium
dominated the initial endowment.

372
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,670
But maybe there's some other way of
rearranging the gods that gets you even

373
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:27,290
further out here. So what I'm, the
Theorem says that's impossible.

374
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,440
So it says if you start with a competitive
equilibrium with an allocation xy,

375
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,560
y for the economy,

376
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:38,810
he the no allocation like that one.

377
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:43,190
No allocation x I had,
why I had can pray will dominate it.

378
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:46,400
This couldn't happen. You'd have to be
down here somewhere. That couldn't happen.

379
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,850
Provided this other
allocation used up there

380
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:53,880
resources that were available. So the
sum of the xs and this allocation is the,

381
00:24:53,881 --> 00:24:56,550
some of the initial endowments
and the sum of the YS.

382
00:24:56,551 --> 00:25:00,390
And this allocation is the some of the
initial endowments over the people.

383
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:05,340
So nothing else. Of course, if
you add more goods to the economy,

384
00:25:05,341 --> 00:25:08,820
you can make everybody better off. But
using the existing goods in the economy,

385
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,610
which is the sum of the aix
is in the son of the Ui wise,

386
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,180
there's no way to make everyone better
off than at the competitive equilibrium.

387
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:20,450
So it says literally if p EXCI why is an
equilibrium for the economy e which is

388
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:25,380
that which includes the initial
endowments, the no allocation Exci hat.

389
00:25:25,381 --> 00:25:28,960
Why I hat parade? Oh dominates EXCI. Why?

390
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:33,750
If the sum over, I have x
hat, eagles are some over,

391
00:25:33,751 --> 00:25:35,910
I have e I x,

392
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:40,420
and if the sum of the y eyes
over I equals y had eyes over,

393
00:25:40,421 --> 00:25:42,800
I equals the sum of the EIY.

394
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:48,210
Okay, and others, that's the theorem.

395
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:52,080
So we've totally weakened the
definition of equilibrium.

396
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,790
So might be that if you, if you add,
if this is the competitive allocation,

397
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:01,260
if you look at this line,
this is same psalm of utilities,

398
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,780
right?
Because of the slope is minus one.

399
00:26:06,781 --> 00:26:08,870
And here's the utility to
be in the utility to a,

400
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,490
everything on this line
has the same utility.

401
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,870
So that theorem would say anything else
that's feasible had to be down here.

402
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,820
The sum is less than that.

403
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,080
But here we're not saying that we're
no longer saying that maybe you can

404
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,590
increase the sum from this sacral
liberty and you could increase the sum by

405
00:26:25,591 --> 00:26:29,940
taking something away from a and giving
it to be, you could increase the sum.

406
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,550
Okay,
so that would have been here.

407
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,880
You increase the sum so you no longer

408
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,910
maximize the sum. But the fact
is to make, be better off.

409
00:26:38,911 --> 00:26:42,600
He had to make a worse off. And that's
the new criteria. Predo efficiency.

410
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,700
Okay.

411
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,140
So that's the CRM and now we're going to
prove it so that you can see the whole

412
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:53,400
logic of the free market
is just amounts to that.

413
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:56,670
So there are any questions about this?
Do you all supposedly saw this before?

414
00:26:56,671 --> 00:27:00,540
But um, that doesn't mean you really
did. So does anyone have a question?

415
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:03,450
What's going on? It's a very
basic, incredibly important idea.

416
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,303
Okay.

417
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,880
All right.
So have you one more chance.

418
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:13,610
Somebody must have a question.
Yes.

419
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,353
Can.

420
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,740
Yes. Why don't I draw a picture, which
is what I was going to do anyway.

421
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:26,170
So let's draw a picture
and I'll,

422
00:27:26,171 --> 00:27:29,740
I'll bring the theorem back
after having drawn the picture.

423
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,800
Okay. So the picture is
going to be due to Edgeworth.

424
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,370
So he invented the indifference curve
and invented it in order to draw this

425
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:46,360
picture. That was incredibly
clever picture. So he says,

426
00:27:46,361 --> 00:27:49,330
let's look at this economy. And the
one on the right that we start with,

427
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:53,740
we put x a here,
an Xb here,

428
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,320
and you notice that a begins
with an endowment of two.

429
00:27:59,321 --> 00:28:01,930
One.
So let's put as endowment to one here.

430
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:05,670
Okay,

431
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:09,570
so this is he a x equal to,

432
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:15,050
and this is e B e a y equal one.

433
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:20,940
Right. That makes sense. Okay. Now we can
draw indifference curves through that.

434
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,880
So there's difference curves. He
likes x more than he likes. Why?

435
00:28:23,881 --> 00:28:26,760
So the difference curves are going
to be sort of vertical right up.

436
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,890
He doesn't like to give up x very much.

437
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,310
So he's in different curves are
going to look sort of like this.

438
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,893
Okay.

439
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:39,700
And the most important indifference curves
are the ones where he gets better off

440
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,720
than he was before. So now in the
end, they're going to be some price.

441
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,820
He's going to have a,
there's going to be a budget set,

442
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,090
which is x is way more expensive than y.

443
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:53,200
So there's going to be a budget
set that looked like this.

444
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,610
That's sort of the budget
set that he faces. Right?

445
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,020
And he's not going to choose this.
It turns out he chooses

446
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:12,590
something like here, which is, um,

447
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:16,850
he chooses a little bit
less of acts nine fifths.

448
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,233
Yeah.

449
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,040
Okay. And a little bit
more of why. So here's x,

450
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:28,041
say equals nine fifth which is a little
less than two and xb he chose was a,

451
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:35,940
I can't read it, three halves,
which is more than one. Okay.

452
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,470
Are you with me? That make, are
you, you asked the question,

453
00:29:38,471 --> 00:29:42,010
does this picture make sense?
Okay, so he obviously did better

454
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:46,120
than he did before, but
it's really, you know,

455
00:29:46,121 --> 00:29:47,620
we've got another guy to worry about.

456
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:51,910
So how can you put the second
guy in the same diagram? Well,

457
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:57,160
let's just finish.
Let's just add the total endowment.

458
00:29:57,161 --> 00:30:01,660
Where's the total endowment?
Well, it's three units of
each. So here we've got two.

459
00:30:01,661 --> 00:30:03,010
So this is one.

460
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,533
MMM.

461
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:09,930
To this must be three.
Okay,

462
00:30:09,931 --> 00:30:14,640
so total endowment of good x is three
two plus one is three and I'm good.

463
00:30:14,641 --> 00:30:17,400
Why is three as well?
Here's one, here's two.

464
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:19,890
Here's three was supposed to be a square.

465
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:25,020
So heres the aggregate endowment.
It's here.

466
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:30,060
This is the total endowment.
Three of three of each. Okay.

467
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,590
But now we can do,

468
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,180
we can put B.
All right.

469
00:30:36,181 --> 00:30:38,870
So what is feasible?

470
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,000
What are the feasible allocations?
So this is a,

471
00:30:42,001 --> 00:30:44,940
an extremely clever inside
of edge worth. He said, look,

472
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:47,040
the total endowment is three common three.

473
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:51,090
If I tell you that a has got two
common one, that's this point,

474
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,820
what's leftover be must be consuming.

475
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,400
So bees consuming the
distance from here to here,

476
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:01,550
which is obviously one comma two and if
a ends up over here at nine 53 halves,

477
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,460
okay? That's from here to here is nine
fifths and three halves since the total is

478
00:31:08,461 --> 00:31:12,110
three three B's obviously doing,
consuming what's leftover.

479
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,110
So he's consuming this difference.
Okay? So whatever a does,

480
00:31:16,111 --> 00:31:18,600
you can see in the diagram
looking at it the normal way.

481
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,780
But if you just sort of twist your
mind a little bit and look from this

482
00:31:21,781 --> 00:31:25,020
direction, once you know what a is doing,
you can figure out what bees doing.

483
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:29,850
So each of these points
defines a feasible allocation.

484
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:33,600
Okay? And now what we want
to say, the Theorem says,

485
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:37,950
look at the utilities that a and
B I got out of this allocation.

486
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:42,150
A God is on this indifference curve.
You know what he's doing cause it be,

487
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:45,540
you know it was coming from here.
We know how he's, how he's doing.

488
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,940
So look at the allocation they got.

489
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:53,250
You can't make both people better off
than that by choosing some other point in

490
00:31:53,251 --> 00:31:56,190
this square. So let's look at
it from bees point of view.

491
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,250
From bees point of view, he likes
more of everything. So if a gets less,

492
00:32:02,251 --> 00:32:05,880
B's going to get more. So from bees
point of view, the further out you go,

493
00:32:05,881 --> 00:32:09,870
this way the veteran is
for for a, B, c, so B's,

494
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,850
the axes for B looks like that.

495
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,000
So he's going to have
some indifference curve.

496
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,773
That

497
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,750
B's indifference curve is going to look.

498
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,183
MMM,

499
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:32,270
he's indifference curve
has to look like this.

500
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:35,030
So here's where be started here.

501
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:40,450
And then B's going to be
better off doing lists.

502
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,880
So B's indifference curve looks,
something like that.

503
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,530
Those are Bs and difference curves.

504
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,430
Okay. So the further out you go
this way, the better off P is.

505
00:32:53,431 --> 00:32:56,880
So as you shrink with aid gets,
that obviously means bees getting more.

506
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,810
And so bees getting happier
and happier. Okay. So what,

507
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,980
what is the definition of prey to
efficiency? Whatever point we pick.

508
00:33:04,981 --> 00:33:09,660
Like this one to begin with. Is there
a way of making both people better off?

509
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,900
Well, the answer is the competitive
equilibrium makes both people better off.

510
00:33:12,901 --> 00:33:15,640
Why is that? If you can
see it from back there. Uh,

511
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:20,220
the reason is that a went from this
white indifference curve to a better

512
00:33:20,221 --> 00:33:24,780
indifference curve over here be who's
budget line is the same budget line looked

513
00:33:24,781 --> 00:33:26,010
at from his point of view.

514
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:31,050
He went from his indifference
curve over here to one here.

515
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:34,470
Okay. So he went from this yellow
indifference curve to a better one.

516
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:39,470
So both of them got better off going
to this, uh, final allocations.

517
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,291
And they started with,

518
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:44,550
and of course that had to be true because
a could always have chosen to stay

519
00:33:44,551 --> 00:33:46,590
where he was at two one he moved to nine.

520
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:49,290
Fifth three has cause it was
better and B could have started,

521
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:53,400
stayed where she was at one. Two she
chose to go to five. Two to six fifths.

522
00:33:53,401 --> 00:33:55,020
Three has cause it made her better off.

523
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:58,830
So both of the must be better off at the
final allocation and the word to begin

524
00:33:58,831 --> 00:34:02,910
with. Okay. Now what is the
theorem say? The theorem says,

525
00:34:02,911 --> 00:34:07,911
remember in pictures it says whatever
point we pick here that defines something

526
00:34:08,161 --> 00:34:09,960
for a and define something for B.

527
00:34:09,961 --> 00:34:13,770
Then we can look at the utility
welfare functions of both and see what

528
00:34:13,771 --> 00:34:17,010
indifference curves there
on the theorem says.

529
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,470
There's no other point
in this whole diagram,

530
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:23,970
which puts both a and B on a higher
indifference curve for each of them than

531
00:34:23,971 --> 00:34:28,650
they were at the competitive equilibrium.
So if I read the definition again,

532
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,320
it says if I'm at,

533
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,250
if I start with an economy there with
the endowments and the Utility Functions,

534
00:34:35,251 --> 00:34:39,000
so the endowments and the indifference
curves and I compute the competitive

535
00:34:39,001 --> 00:34:43,560
equilibrium like we did over
there. Okay, then no allocation,

536
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:48,590
that means no point in that box could
make everybody better off than they were

537
00:34:48,781 --> 00:34:51,480
at the competitive equilibrium provided

538
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,380
that Newpoint is in the box.

539
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:59,030
So it makes the sum of the xs equal to
the sum of the endowments and the sum of

540
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:01,430
the ys equal to the sum
of the endowments of why.

541
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,250
Okay.

542
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,000
Okay.

543
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,740
So Edgeworth this is the end of the proof.

544
00:35:08,741 --> 00:35:12,520
We already gave the proof according to
Edgeworth. Okay, so what's the proof?

545
00:35:12,521 --> 00:35:16,120
According to Edgeworth, he says it's all
a matter of looking at it the right way.

546
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,060
It's easy to look at the
picture from aes point of view.

547
00:35:19,061 --> 00:35:23,260
You just look at the x
axis and the y axis. Okay?

548
00:35:23,261 --> 00:35:24,670
This is the y axis.

549
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,150
What is this?
This is,

550
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:39,480
this is a x. A why it
was three halves. Okay,

551
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:45,000
so you look at it. So this is the y
axis going this way. This is the y axis.

552
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:48,360
And this is the x axis
going this way for a,

553
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:52,380
it's very simple to look at the y
axis and the x axis for a A's got his

554
00:35:52,381 --> 00:35:56,190
indifference curve getting
better and better. Okay. And um,

555
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,810
B. Okay, so from [inaudible]
point of view, it's very simple.

556
00:36:00,811 --> 00:36:03,750
You look at the endowment,
you draw the budget line through it,

557
00:36:03,751 --> 00:36:06,210
which is some linear line,
and then a picks.

558
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:09,210
The best point in that budget
set drawing the tangent,

559
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:12,600
which is the white indifference
curve to this point right here.

560
00:36:12,601 --> 00:36:13,770
That's the best he can do.

561
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:18,330
Now the trick is to see that
from bees point of view up here.

562
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,550
From these point of view of here,

563
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:25,560
things look very similar because bees
and downwind is also at this point he's

564
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:29,820
got one unit up here of
x and two units of y.

565
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,560
Okay, why does he have that? Because
the two together added up to three.

566
00:36:34,561 --> 00:36:36,360
So if this is what A's and dumb it was,

567
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:40,380
then of course what's leftover is bs
endowment, so be it has to go here.

568
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,470
Now what is the budget set
look like for me? Well,

569
00:36:43,471 --> 00:36:46,800
it's also a linear thing with the same
slope and it goes through this point.

570
00:36:46,801 --> 00:36:50,670
So from his point of view,
this pink line is also his budget set.

571
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,880
It goes from here all the way down to
where it hits his y axis down here they've

572
00:36:56,641 --> 00:37:00,510
got the same budget set. Just looked
at it from opposite sides. Okay.

573
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:04,020
And now what does competitive equilibrium
and supply equals demand means it

574
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:07,920
means that we're an AA chooses
this point as the best point. Okay.

575
00:37:07,921 --> 00:37:09,540
Which happened to have been nine fifths,

576
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:14,541
three halves then be is happy to choose
what's leftover is his best point.

577
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:18,150
So his optimal point on
his indifference curves,

578
00:37:18,151 --> 00:37:22,080
that's tangent to his budget set has
to be the same point looked at from his

579
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:26,640
origin instead of A's origin. That's
the trick. And so now you real, okay.

580
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:31,350
So that's the key insight that
Edgeworth had, his beautiful picture.

581
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,680
And now the point is that if the quite
indifference curve looks like that,

582
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,470
anything that makes a better off
has to be on this side of the white

583
00:37:40,471 --> 00:37:43,020
indifference curve.
And the yellow indifference curve,

584
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,700
which is B's indifference curve,

585
00:37:44,701 --> 00:37:48,210
anything that makes her better off has
to be on this side of the yellow curve.

586
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,570
But the white curve goes that way
and the yellow curve goes that way.

587
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:56,490
So there's no point that's simultaneously
above A's indifference curve and also

588
00:37:56,491 --> 00:38:00,930
above B's indifference curve. So therefore
nothing could parade or dominate it.

589
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,200
So that's the Edgeworth proof.
Yes.

590
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,063
Right?

591
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:13,920
That the pink budget line describes
what you can afford to buy,

592
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,950
describes the budget equation,
this equation.

593
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,210
So everyone's going to
choose on the pink line.

594
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,460
Okay? Now what's feasible as they could
choose, any points, it's feasible.

595
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:29,970
You're going to cook this point is
feasible. B gets almost nothing in a,

596
00:38:29,971 --> 00:38:31,140
it gets almost everything.

597
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:35,440
Bees never going to let himself be forced
down there because B can choose on the

598
00:38:35,441 --> 00:38:36,130
pink wines.

599
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,810
He's always going to choose
something better than that.

600
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:41,603
Yeah.

601
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:46,150
Okay, so that's proof number one. I'm just
going to give proof number two. So okay,

602
00:38:46,151 --> 00:38:47,950
you've,
most of you've seen this before,

603
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,730
but I'm going to give another proof
and then I'm going to ask you a quick,

604
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:55,720
then I'm going to see whether you really
understand what all this means. Okay?

605
00:38:55,721 --> 00:38:57,400
So here's a second proof.

606
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,670
Okay? And this is a much
better proof. So now approve.

607
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,690
So I'm gonna write this Algebraic late,

608
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,720
the proof of Arrow 1951
and Dobro 1951 separately.

609
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:23,030
Okay, so this is called the fundamental
theorem of economics first welfare theme,

610
00:39:23,031 --> 00:39:26,280
or if economics. Okay.
So all this picture,

611
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:29,740
I'll stuff make so many
assumptions. You'll, there
are only two kinds of traders.

612
00:39:29,741 --> 00:39:32,260
They're only two goods.
There's somehow never,

613
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,320
because they're consuming only
on the boundaries. I mean,

614
00:39:35,321 --> 00:39:38,080
they're never consuming on the boundaries.
It's always in this on know it,

615
00:39:38,081 --> 00:39:40,980
just so many special assumptions and,
and uh,

616
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,450
everything's two by two
and it's just special case.

617
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,660
So let's give a much more
general proof of this theorem.

618
00:39:46,661 --> 00:39:49,600
So here we've got two
goods won't play any role.

619
00:39:49,601 --> 00:39:51,940
There could be any number of goods.
There are two goods only here,

620
00:39:51,941 --> 00:39:55,090
but there are many traders,
lots and lots of traders.

621
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:59,350
So what's the proof that x hat,

622
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,160
why hat couldn't parade?
Oh dominated.

623
00:40:03,161 --> 00:40:06,790
So suppose that we've got
this is equal to summation,

624
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:09,310
x hat I,

625
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,730
and this is equal to the summation.

626
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:15,670
Okay,

627
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:20,050
why Hat I? Okay, so we've
got another allocation,

628
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:20,884
which is feasible.

629
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,503
Cool.

630
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:28,960
So could it be that this other feasible
allocations of x hats and white hats,

631
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,300
could that make everybody better off?

632
00:40:31,301 --> 00:40:34,290
Could that make each I
better off than Exci? Why I,

633
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:39,010
and this proof is so short
and so beautiful, so elegant.

634
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:44,450
And so convincing that it's mesmerize
people now for over 50 years and it,

635
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:48,700
it prevents them from seeing that
there could be even a more in general

636
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:53,410
situations where things aren't so great.
So what is the proof? It's two lines.

637
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:59,130
If x at y hat is really better for I
then I claim line one w I have x hat,

638
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:08,170
uh, y hat. I, okay, this is, sorry.

639
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:12,010
So this is this line zero.
This is just repeating what's the case?

640
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:16,870
Wwi of x had high.
Why had I greater than W EXCI why?

641
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:21,580
Hey, that's for all I, that's
the claim. Could this happen

642
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,670
that you've got a feasible x hat?

643
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:33,890
I why had I and it makes everybody
better off than Exci. Okay.

644
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:38,360
Could this happen? The answer is
no. Line one is, if that were true,

645
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:43,570
then it would have to be the case that p
x times x Xy hat plus p y times y hat I

646
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:53,080
had to be greater than p x
times x Plus p y times e I.

647
00:41:54,321 --> 00:41:57,080
Why?
Why is that?

648
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:01,520
Because the budget set of Mr I says

649
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:07,140
he spends all his money on x and Y in
his budget set and does the best he can.

650
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:11,200
Okay, this is Saul's Exci
why I solves this problem.

651
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:16,000
So if this thing really makes them
better off than what he chose,

652
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:19,300
it can't be that it was
affordable. Otherwise he would
have bought this instead.

653
00:42:19,301 --> 00:42:22,960
I ain't bought this instead.
So it has to be that this Alec can for I,

654
00:42:22,961 --> 00:42:25,640
this bundle costs more than he can afford.
That's why

655
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,060
choose it.
So this relies

656
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,950
on agent rationality.

657
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,300
Everybody given his choices, he doesn't
care about the rest of the world,

658
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:40,900
but given his choices,
everybody's doing the best thing he can.

659
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:45,940
Okay. Now, Shiller would say people
make mistakes. They're crazy.

660
00:42:45,941 --> 00:42:48,100
They have no idea what they're
doing. They're stupid. They're,

661
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:51,220
there's some guy tells him a story
and the bar one night and they totally

662
00:42:51,221 --> 00:42:54,580
changed their life around. They switched,
you know, the, so he'd say, well,

663
00:42:54,581 --> 00:42:58,630
this isn't true. All right. But anyway, I,

664
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:04,330
I actually believe that people have
more sense about deciding for themselves

665
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:07,480
what's good for them. Then third parties
do about deciding what's good for them.

666
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:09,310
So I don't want to challenge

667
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,250
this.
So if you don't challenge this,

668
00:43:11,251 --> 00:43:13,950
you conclude that if something
makes everybody better off,

669
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,160
each person must have found
this allocation unaffordable.

670
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,240
Otherwise he would have chosen it

671
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:20,670
over pie ea.

672
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:25,450
I why it's all I did was that's
true for every single person I saw.

673
00:43:25,451 --> 00:43:29,640
I could add this inequality for I plus
listen to quality for j plus this and

674
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,120
equality for all the people.

675
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:35,770
And then I use the distributive law to
take the sum inside and I have this,

676
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:37,211
okay,

677
00:43:37,211 --> 00:43:42,211
but that is impossible and that's the
end of the proof because the sum of this

678
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:48,700
XII x had I is equal to this son.
That was what we are supposed.

679
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:52,550
You're just rearranging all the goods
that are really there and this, um,

680
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,090
is the same as this.
Um,

681
00:43:55,930 --> 00:44:00,550
so therefore since the new allocation
just rearranges the endowment differently

682
00:44:00,551 --> 00:44:04,210
from the equilibrium and rearranges
the x's maybe differently from the

683
00:44:04,211 --> 00:44:04,930
equilibrium,

684
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:08,050
it has to be that actually this thing on
the left is equal to this thing in the

685
00:44:08,051 --> 00:44:11,680
right. It's identical to it. So I can't
be greater. And that's the contradiction.

686
00:44:11,681 --> 00:44:14,170
That's the end of the proof.
So it's two lines,

687
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:16,810
two lines to prove what you know.

688
00:44:16,811 --> 00:44:21,811
Adam Smith's spent 400 pages arguing
that the free market is a good thing.

689
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:29,800
Okay. So this is the basis for the
idea that we shouldn't regulate,

690
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:33,450
we shouldn't regulate, we
shouldn't. Sounds pretty convincing.

691
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:38,540
So any questions about this?
Anything that you'd like to say? I'm,

692
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,900
are you convinced by this?

693
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,560
Okay. So what are some reasons you don't
believe this? I need some obvious reason.

694
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:55,570
Yes. Well, even if this would make sense,

695
00:44:55,571 --> 00:44:59,980
a lot of regulation policies changing
the pricing of the things anyways,

696
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,780
so we're not necessarily,

697
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:07,590
no, but that's so you.
Okay. So it's a good,

698
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,890
so that glad you asked that
question cause it no, no,

699
00:45:10,891 --> 00:45:14,460
it betrays a misunderstanding.
So I'm glad you asked that question.

700
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:19,410
So suppose that someone came in a given
these assumptions that we've made.

701
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,270
Okay. So this theme is correct, given
the assumptions. Now he made a standard.

702
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:27,780
Okay. So there was a little bit
mistake in the reasoning he made.

703
00:45:27,781 --> 00:45:28,890
I'm going to repeat his question,

704
00:45:28,891 --> 00:45:31,590
change it a little bit so maybe he'll
deny this is what he was saying.

705
00:45:31,591 --> 00:45:35,870
But I believe what he just said is what
really happens in a lot of regulations

706
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:39,450
as they come in and they change
the prices, they tax and good,

707
00:45:39,451 --> 00:45:42,900
they prevent people from trading so much.
So the price changes,

708
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:47,190
they subsidize something, something
happens so that you get different prices.

709
00:45:47,191 --> 00:45:50,190
And of course if those different
prices you get a different allocation.

710
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,860
And then he said that's all true so far.
And then he said,

711
00:45:52,861 --> 00:45:56,990
because there are different prices,
um, you know, you can't compare the,

712
00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:00,390
the original equilibrium allocation
to the new aqua lived from allocation.

713
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,860
Well that's where he
short changed this proof.

714
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,570
This proof says,
however you get to a new allocation x hat.

715
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,560
I why had I,

716
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:13,530
maybe it's because the government has
intervened and changed all the prices and

717
00:46:13,531 --> 00:46:16,830
done a bunch of other stuff, but in
the end, after all that intervention,

718
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:21,420
the government is going to get you to
a new allocation x had I why had I and

719
00:46:21,421 --> 00:46:26,190
that new allocation can't be better
than the original one. Okay. So,

720
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:30,630
so that's the force of the argument.
No matter what the government does,

721
00:46:30,631 --> 00:46:34,680
it's going to, in the end, the, the upshot
is a new allocation EC Sadye why had I,

722
00:46:34,681 --> 00:46:37,470
we don't have to think about how
it got there. That's where it got,

723
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,960
and according to this argument,
it can't be better.

724
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,260
So the argument is correct and elegant.

725
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:45,170
There must be something
missing to the arguments.

726
00:46:45,171 --> 00:46:48,150
Some assumption you don't really
believe, if you doubt the argument, yes,

727
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,500
your allocation,

728
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,510
even at the expensive,

729
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:58,030
what if you want an allocation?

730
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:03,270
It's socially desirable that
have an allocation that's
better for one party even

731
00:47:03,271 --> 00:47:05,740
if that comes up.
Another one.

732
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:10,070
Okay, so one argument you could
say is that all right, it may be.

733
00:47:10,071 --> 00:47:14,330
And the Aqua Librium that a,
okay. So who's better off here?

734
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:19,280
You notice that this equilibrium a ends
up with more of everything than B does.

735
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,720
Okay,
so a,

736
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:25,040
so you could say the second is not very
socially desirable because a ends up

737
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:28,550
with more of everything than
B does released as much of
everything is speed does

738
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,230
and that unjust and unfair.
And so we don't like the allocation.

739
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:35,080
And so maybe we should
move something from a to B.

740
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:39,730
So that's an argument on the basis
of justice. It says we can find,

741
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:43,300
just are allocations, uh, that are
somehow socially more desirable.

742
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:47,260
But this argument of Predo
efficiencies about efficiency, okay,

743
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,260
maybe you could, uh, you know, you,

744
00:47:50,261 --> 00:47:54,910
you could hurt a to help B because
that's, you know, serves your,

745
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,710
your desire for fairness.

746
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:00,010
But that doesn't say anything about
how efficient the allocation is.

747
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:03,710
It's still true that the original
allocation was efficient in the sense you

748
00:48:03,711 --> 00:48:06,820
couldn't make anyone better off.
So the economist would say,

749
00:48:06,821 --> 00:48:08,320
in order to hurt a and help be,

750
00:48:08,321 --> 00:48:12,190
what you should do is take some of A's
and downwind away from him and give it to

751
00:48:12,191 --> 00:48:15,940
her and then let them trade to a new
competitive equilibrium where she began

752
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:16,890
with more than him.

753
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:21,490
So the just thing to do is to rearrange
the resources at the beginning and still

754
00:48:21,491 --> 00:48:26,320
let people trade to a final allocation.
Okay. So that's an argument from fairness,

755
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:28,960
but it doesn't,
it doesn't interfere.

756
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:32,980
It doesn't contradict the economic
argument that fair or unfair.

757
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,320
It's still efficient.
We've done as well as we could,

758
00:48:35,321 --> 00:48:38,170
making everyone as happy as we can
and maybe we can hurt someone and help

759
00:48:38,171 --> 00:48:42,640
someone else. We can't help everyone at
the same time. Whereas most regulation,

760
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:46,300
the argument in favor of regulation is
you're helping everybody by regulating.

761
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,820
And this says you can't ever do that.
So what's missing?

762
00:48:48,821 --> 00:48:52,270
What's some of the assumptions should
be an elementary question for you. Yes,

763
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,890
no,
it's got all those assumptions.

764
00:48:59,891 --> 00:49:03,090
So there's something about the model
that's too narrow and you should be,

765
00:49:03,091 --> 00:49:06,280
and this should be easy and you're going
to tell me obvious things where it's

766
00:49:06,281 --> 00:49:09,640
too narrow and then a and the, so I'm
going to just say where we're going.

767
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:12,700
You're supposed to be telling me now
obvious ways. This is too narrow.

768
00:49:12,701 --> 00:49:14,410
I'm going to say you're right.
You're right, you're right.

769
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:18,070
But finance is different. We don't have
to worry about those problems supposedly.

770
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:22,510
So go ahead. Back there. You. Okay.

771
00:49:22,511 --> 00:49:27,370
So one critical shortcoming of this
argument is that there are externalities.

772
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,780
Suppose that,
um,

773
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:33,880
ex is cigarettes and a smoking,

774
00:49:33,881 --> 00:49:38,290
buying and smoking more
cigarettes makes be sick. Okay?

775
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,200
So that's not part of this.
Why is that not part of this?

776
00:49:41,201 --> 00:49:45,520
Because bees utility depends only on
bees consuming, not what AI is doing.

777
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,940
Okay.
So there's no place in this model,

778
00:49:48,941 --> 00:49:51,370
it's too narrow to include externalities.

779
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:54,820
So it doesn't capture the
fact that a might be making,

780
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:59,410
he by smoking might make her sick by
smoking so many cigarettes and that's not

781
00:49:59,411 --> 00:50:02,590
in here. And if you put the idea
that utility bees, utilities,

782
00:50:02,591 --> 00:50:06,520
her utility might depend on what he's
doing and now with just not what she's

783
00:50:06,521 --> 00:50:08,500
doing, the fear, it won't be true.

784
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:12,790
So there's a reason to tax pollution and
to tax cigarettes and all those things

785
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:16,960
because of externalities. Okay. So that's
the fun. That's a fundamental problem.

786
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:18,363
Yes.

787
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,680
Well, we're assuming diminishing margin
utility, but there are different,

788
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:28,100
each person has a different curves.
So yes,

789
00:50:28,101 --> 00:50:30,860
we assume that they're all
curved away from the origin.

790
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:34,610
So we assumed diminishing margin
utility. But I think you know, that,

791
00:50:34,611 --> 00:50:37,880
that I'm almost prepared to believe
diminishing margin. Utill you know,

792
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,290
it's not literally true. You don't like
two tickets are better than, you know, uh,

793
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:47,380
going from moving from one ticket to two
tickets may be a huge gain in utility

794
00:50:47,661 --> 00:50:51,950
cause now you can bring your friend along
and going to third, a third ticket. Uh,

795
00:50:51,951 --> 00:50:52,191
you know,

796
00:50:52,191 --> 00:50:55,130
going from getting one ticket might not
be worth much because you don't want to

797
00:50:55,131 --> 00:50:55,551
go alone.

798
00:50:55,551 --> 00:50:58,850
Getting the second one may add a huge
amount of utility that's an increasing

799
00:50:58,851 --> 00:51:01,850
margin utility, but eventually
after you've got enough tickets,

800
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:04,460
it's going to be diminishing margin
utilities. So I believe on the whole,

801
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:07,700
the diminishing margin. Utilities,
not such a bad assumption,

802
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:10,770
but this clearly relies on that.
So you're right, but I'm not,

803
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:15,770
I don't think that's the critical
problem. What else is there? Yes. What?

804
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:20,030
Okay. Credit markets. Right
now we're starting to talk
a little bit about finance.

805
00:51:20,031 --> 00:51:21,620
So just hold that thought for one second.

806
00:51:21,621 --> 00:51:25,550
Anything else you can think of besides
externalities? That's terrible for,

807
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:29,660
okay, so, all right, so, okay,
so let me transition this way.

808
00:51:29,661 --> 00:51:34,040
So of course people noticed externalities
and other kinds of regulation is

809
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,000
perfect competition.
And you know,

810
00:51:36,001 --> 00:51:38,480
we assumed everyone took the
prices has given there are enough,

811
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:40,280
there was no monopolist,
you know,

812
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,760
setting the price and refusing to
bargain with people and stuff like that.

813
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:48,940
So regulation could come about in order
to enforce the competitive equilibrium

814
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:52,550
to allow for perfect competition.
So we assumed that already,

815
00:51:52,551 --> 00:51:55,670
that's one place for regulation and
a second place is because of these

816
00:51:55,671 --> 00:51:59,090
externalities. So for a hundred,
you know, 50 to 100 years,

817
00:51:59,091 --> 00:52:01,310
everybody has accepted
those two arguments.

818
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,360
Clearly there's a place for
regulating free markets,

819
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:09,620
ensuring free markets and stopping
trusts and monopolies and for stopping

820
00:52:09,621 --> 00:52:10,460
externalities.

821
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:15,050
But then people said
finance okay is different.

822
00:52:15,051 --> 00:52:17,840
As long as you know there aren't
any externalities. You know,

823
00:52:17,841 --> 00:52:20,450
you're just trading stocks and bonds,
there's no pollution.

824
00:52:20,451 --> 00:52:23,330
Nobody's going to get sick because
someone else has a stock or a bond.

825
00:52:23,331 --> 00:52:24,560
Some people,
it might be jealous,

826
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:26,930
but we're not really going to
take that into account. We don't,

827
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:29,750
we don't want to honor those
kinds of feelings of jealousy.

828
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,270
So the arguments seem to
be when you get to finance,

829
00:52:32,271 --> 00:52:34,190
you don't have to worry
about externalities. And yes,

830
00:52:34,191 --> 00:52:35,870
you have to worry about
perfect competition.

831
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:39,140
But once you've got perfect competition,
that's the end of the story.

832
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:42,260
So the rest of the course now
is going to be, if you've,

833
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,470
if you forget about externalities,
okay,

834
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,630
because you forget about
pollution because you know,

835
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:51,140
there were trading pieces of paper,
they're not polluting anything.

836
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:55,550
Why shouldn't the financial
markets be efficient?

837
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:58,250
Why doesn't this argument
apply to the financial markets?

838
00:52:58,251 --> 00:53:01,010
And one of the critical financial
markets is the credit market.

839
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:06,020
So can you understand the credit market
on just these terms and therefore argue

840
00:53:06,021 --> 00:53:07,100
that the market's efficient.

841
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:10,790
So we're going to spend a large part
of the course talking about that.

842
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:13,490
So unless you had some
particular point to raise,

843
00:53:13,491 --> 00:53:17,540
now I'm going to just use your
comment is a good introduction to the,

844
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,990
to the next part of the course. Okay. So,

845
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:25,110
so far there's nothing that seems
to directly involve finance,

846
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:29,070
what we've been talking about.
So where does the finance come in?

847
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:34,640
So Irving Fisher was the
person who created the first
really general equilibrium

848
00:53:35,071 --> 00:53:39,360
model of finance. So he was
a Yale undergraduate. Uh,

849
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:43,920
he, you know, was a superstar at Yale
undergraduate and he invented a, anyway,

850
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:47,280
he had an, he had graduated
first in his class from Yale.

851
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:51,030
He decided that he was a math major.
He decided that he wanted to go.

852
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,810
He wanted to build an economic,
uh, financial Eq Librium model.

853
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,910
There were no economists
there at his time.

854
00:53:56,911 --> 00:54:00,870
We're talking in the late 18 hundreds.
And so he went to Gibbs,

855
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:02,760
the famous physicist,
maybe a Ma, you know,

856
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:07,270
one of America's most famous physicist at
the time and said, can you, can you, uh,

857
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:11,880
advise an ex, uh, you know, an
economics phd? And Gibbs said, well,

858
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:15,120
if it's mathematical enough and has a
model and something, yes, I can do it.

859
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,193
And so,

860
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:21,290
fishers a PhD dissertation was basically
reinventing this general equilibrium

861
00:54:21,901 --> 00:54:23,490
model that I've just described,

862
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:28,700
and then making a machine to calculate
equilibrium with water and pumps and

863
00:54:28,831 --> 00:54:31,560
water seeking its own level
and solving for equilibrium.

864
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:36,540
And we had this machine up until
the 1970s in the Coles Foundation.

865
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:40,590
Well when it got stolen and, uh, some,

866
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:45,630
some engineer named Srinivasa and about
10 years ago was ready to rebuild the

867
00:54:45,631 --> 00:54:48,930
machine because we have the dissertation
where it explains very carefully how

868
00:54:48,931 --> 00:54:51,750
Fisher built his machine and
he was going to rebuild it.

869
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:56,790
And then he was offered Elbar
dies job Albara die is the guy,

870
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:58,860
the nuclear inspector who you know,

871
00:54:58,861 --> 00:55:02,550
goes to a rock and says they're building
nuclear stuff and not building this.

872
00:55:02,551 --> 00:55:07,290
And so he was offered that job and so he
left Yale and then decided not to take

873
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:11,070
the job after all. So he's still got
Albury die in the job. And, but anyway,

874
00:55:11,071 --> 00:55:15,270
he left Yale and so we never
got the machine built. Uh,
he was a great guy. And, uh,

875
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:19,410
anyway, so Fisher, uh, after, um,

876
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:24,090
Fisher after writing this dissertation
stayed at Yales and assistant professor

877
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,200
got tenure.

878
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:30,210
It became the most famous economist
probably in the country for awhile. Um,

879
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:34,740
he invented finances.
I'm about to tell you.

880
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:39,090
And he in in a way, this model of finance
I'm about to present, which was the,

881
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,580
you know,
in retrospect,

882
00:55:41,581 --> 00:55:44,310
clearly the most interesting
model of finance if it's time.

883
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:48,150
And he was a financial economist,
but he was famous for,

884
00:55:48,151 --> 00:55:52,170
he also was an entrepreneur. So you'll
see later that he started his own company.

885
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:57,380
It was a pro computer company called
Remington and he managed to make $10

886
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:02,460
million, uh, for his company
in the early 19 hundreds and a,

887
00:56:02,461 --> 00:56:06,870
he was a friend of Roosevelt's and
he kept advising Roosevelt during the

888
00:56:06,871 --> 00:56:10,740
depression to print more money. He said,
print more money, print more money,

889
00:56:10,741 --> 00:56:13,800
put more money in the Yale Library has
all these letters he sent to Roosevelt.

890
00:56:13,801 --> 00:56:17,130
And it also has Roosevelt's responses
where you can tell that Roosevelt is

891
00:56:17,131 --> 00:56:18,510
paying no attention to them.
But,

892
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:22,090
but Fisher's ego seemed to be so
big that he just, I mean, you know,

893
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:22,943
Roosevelt says,

894
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:26,920
I'm very glad that the good professor has
made such more the recommendations and

895
00:56:26,921 --> 00:56:29,800
we'll certainly take them seriously.
And then Fisher writes back and says,

896
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:34,600
I'm glad you're going to follow.
What I suggested. And so, so anyway,

897
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:37,990
Fisher convinced that the
economy was going to turn around,

898
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:41,830
poured all his money into this
computer company, Remington,

899
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:44,290
the company and the
great stock market crash,

900
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:48,100
nearly went bankrupt and was
leveraged. So he had to go to his, uh,

901
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:53,110
he had to go to his wife who was very
wealthy and borrow her money and that they

902
00:56:53,111 --> 00:56:53,861
lost that money.

903
00:56:53,861 --> 00:56:57,520
Then he went to her parents and borrow
all their money and lost that money.

904
00:56:57,521 --> 00:56:59,620
And finally he'd lost
everything of his own money,

905
00:56:59,621 --> 00:57:01,420
his wife's money and his
wife's parents money.

906
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:04,210
And they're about to take his house
from him, foreclosed on his house.

907
00:57:04,211 --> 00:57:07,660
And so Yale was forced to buy his house
forums so he can continue to teach.

908
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:08,763
And so,

909
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:14,520
so he set a bad precedent for economist
at Yale because whenever any economist

910
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:17,470
at Yale has financial
advice to give someone,

911
00:57:17,471 --> 00:57:21,850
always quotes Irvin Fischer's 1929
line that the economy had reached a

912
00:57:21,851 --> 00:57:26,260
permanently high plateau. And,
but anyway, despite all that,

913
00:57:26,261 --> 00:57:30,400
he still, uh, his theories
are well worth studying.

914
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:32,500
He was famous for a few other things.

915
00:57:32,501 --> 00:57:36,010
He's a little bit Shiller as
Cooley trying to imitate Fisher.

916
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:40,300
Fisher wrote a huge number of books,
50 books about everything.

917
00:57:40,301 --> 00:57:44,980
So he got tuberculosis and he survived
and he wrote a series of books on good

918
00:57:44,981 --> 00:57:47,890
living in good health and how to
combat tuberculosis. So he said,

919
00:57:47,891 --> 00:57:51,610
you had to exercise, you have to get fresh
air. And these were huge bestsellers.

920
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:52,840
And um,

921
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:57,040
then he said that drinking
was a terrible thing.

922
00:57:57,190 --> 00:58:01,850
So he did an experiment in class where
he would have his students do pushups,

923
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:03,310
then he'd give them all of our teeny,

924
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,230
then he'd count how many
pushups they could do,

925
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:07,960
and then you give them a second Martini
in countering the questions they could

926
00:58:07,961 --> 00:58:08,380
do.

927
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:13,150
And he found that there was a
10% reduction for each Martini.

928
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:15,910
And so he said that prohibition,

929
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:19,660
since the average business
person had two drinks at lunch,

930
00:58:19,661 --> 00:58:23,350
the prohibition would increase output
by 20%. And so he's one of the,

931
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:27,770
he was one of the leading,
he was one of the leading proponents of,

932
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:32,140
of prohibition. So in that,
after the stock market crash,

933
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:36,460
he helped form the Coles
Foundation. Um, so he,

934
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:40,090
so he, and a bunch, so what, so Coles, uh,

935
00:58:40,091 --> 00:58:44,530
who was a Yale undergraduate,
uh, had run a very famous,

936
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:49,030
uh, uh, macro forecasting
company in the 1920s.

937
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:53,560
And in 1929, the stock market crashed and
he, there were a whole series of these,

938
00:58:53,561 --> 00:58:56,650
they said newsletters, you know,
same kind of stuff they do now. He,

939
00:58:56,651 --> 00:58:57,760
unlike all the others,

940
00:58:58,030 --> 00:59:02,140
after the fact realized that he hadn't
anticipated anything about the crash,

941
00:59:02,141 --> 00:59:05,500
much like nobody anticipated it now.
And he was so embarrassed.

942
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:09,130
He went and collected not only his
old recommendations themselves,

943
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:10,600
but all his competitors.

944
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,660
And so he published a famous paper
in which he argued that it, you know,

945
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,790
economist had no idea what
they were talking about,

946
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:19,150
the fact that they were frauds.
And so he went to his old economist,

947
00:59:19,151 --> 00:59:21,500
Irving Fisher at Yale and said,
look,

948
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:25,340
I just believe that economics
without mathematics has no meaning.

949
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:29,450
I want to start a mathematical
wing of economics.

950
00:59:29,451 --> 00:59:32,390
And I've got a lot of
money. He, his, his, uh,

951
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:35,870
his family owned the Chicago Tribune and
the Seattle times and a whole bunch of

952
00:59:35,871 --> 00:59:38,090
other newspapers. And there
was a famous, you know,

953
00:59:38,091 --> 00:59:41,840
fashion models and the family fleur
coals and stuff like that. So anyway,

954
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:47,370
so with Coles money, Fisher started
the econometric society, uh,

955
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:52,010
which is the most famous mathematical
society and economics, Econometrica,

956
00:59:52,011 --> 00:59:56,150
which is the most famous journal in
economics. And the Coles Foundation,

957
00:59:56,151 --> 00:59:56,984
which they moved,

958
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:01,860
which they started off in Colorado
Springs because cold Fisher set all the,

959
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:04,610
the weather's so good there, everyone
want to go there and it's good for them.

960
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:05,690
So nobody would go there.

961
01:00:05,691 --> 01:00:09,800
So they had to move it to Chicago where
the Tribune was and it was in Chicago

962
01:00:09,801 --> 01:00:14,630
from 1930 to 1955.
And then in 1955,

963
01:00:14,631 --> 01:00:15,620
it moved to Yale.

964
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:19,460
And since then the Coles Foundation has
been a at Yale and you'll hear a lot

965
01:00:19,461 --> 01:00:22,970
more about it later. But anyway,
so Kohl's with that background,

966
01:00:22,971 --> 01:00:26,930
he set out to figure out how
to turn economics. In fact,

967
01:00:26,931 --> 01:00:30,770
he invented economics, this model
of equilibrium to study finance.

968
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:35,210
But so far we don't have any finance in
the model. So how can you put it in? Well,

969
01:00:35,211 --> 01:00:36,290
what is missing?

970
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:41,350
What do I need to put in the model in
order to have to turn it into finance?

971
01:00:41,781 --> 01:00:44,630
What would you say is missing?
How would you turn this into finance?

972
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:51,040
What are the key thing? Yes. Okay.

973
01:00:51,041 --> 01:00:55,320
So the first thing, oh, of course,
you may have read ahead in the notes,

974
01:00:55,321 --> 01:01:00,030
but that's a brilliant insight.
If it's yours, um, you need,

975
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,850
you need time in the model.
So far we just had,

976
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,820
you know, apples and oranges
or something being traded.

977
01:01:10,821 --> 01:01:14,180
So the first thing is Fisher said
you need to put time in the model.

978
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:17,900
What else is critically
missing in this model?

979
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:21,710
One other thing. The
major other thing. Yeah,

980
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:23,963
what?

981
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:28,050
Okay. Well that's good. There's
risk that's missing entirely.

982
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:31,500
So Fisher actually couldn't figure
out how to put that in the model,

983
01:01:31,501 --> 01:01:35,310
but we're gonna, we're gonna get to
that. So what else did Fisher, what?

984
01:01:35,311 --> 01:01:37,680
That was great. That's very
good. What else is missing?

985
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:39,813
Yup.

986
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:44,570
Okay. Wow. Okay. So time fishing,

987
01:01:44,571 --> 01:01:48,860
you'll see had something to say about
time and impatience that people always

988
01:01:48,861 --> 01:01:50,690
care more about the
present and the future.

989
01:01:50,691 --> 01:01:54,050
But what other fundamental thing
about what is the finance all about?

990
01:01:54,051 --> 01:01:56,210
When you think about finance,
what do you think about? Yes.

991
01:01:58,140 --> 01:01:58,973
Great.

992
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:04,090
Okay. So you think about credit as
she said, credit interest rates.

993
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:10,960
Okay, and what else? Sure. Return. Okay,

994
01:02:10,961 --> 01:02:15,490
that's quite related to that.
So all this has to go on the model,

995
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,910
but what fundamental object, when you
think the first thing you think about,

996
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,260
what do you think of? Yes. Money. Okay.

997
01:02:22,261 --> 01:02:24,450
So that's not what I had in mind,

998
01:02:24,451 --> 01:02:28,110
but I'm glad that you think about
that's what most of these, right?

999
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:31,680
That is what most people think
about. So money. So in this course,

1000
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:33,570
we're not going to
provide a theory of money.

1001
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:37,050
So Fisher did provide his theory of
money and that's what he was talking to

1002
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,110
Roosevelt about all the time.
But we're not gonna. So he,

1003
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:43,430
we're going to talk about inflation
and stuff like that, but not a theory.

1004
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:45,660
We're not going to explain
where the inflation comes from.

1005
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:47,490
So inflation is going
to be very important,

1006
01:02:47,491 --> 01:02:51,930
but we're not going to talk about a
theory of money. So what else is missing?

1007
01:02:51,931 --> 01:02:54,150
Something really basic though.
Yes.

1008
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:00,340
Okay. So there are no banks and
things like that. Institutions.

1009
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:01,263
Okay.

1010
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:08,910
Okay. And still something come
on. What, what, what's the

1011
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:10,603
what?

1012
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,760
Loaning funds? Well, somebody said credit.

1013
01:03:14,761 --> 01:03:18,960
That's sort of loaning funds and
interest rates and collateral.

1014
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:22,140
That's something that's good then
I'm going to add that. Thank you.

1015
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:27,030
What a brilliant idea. And
what, what, what, what uh,

1016
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:31,980
what basic thing come on. Yes. No. Well,
okay. That's in the model where as well,

1017
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:32,970
it's already there.

1018
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:37,020
So you know when you take your endowment
and you multiply it by the prices in

1019
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:40,260
your budget set, that's your wealth.
So wealth is already, we've got,

1020
01:03:40,261 --> 01:03:45,030
well gabble capital. Okay,
so capital and let's say,

1021
01:03:45,031 --> 01:03:49,710
and what is capital? What do
you mean by capital? It's money.

1022
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:54,930
I already told you that's not quite going
to be there. So contract will you? Okay,

1023
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:59,760
so con, so we're getting
their contract assets. Okay.

1024
01:03:59,761 --> 01:04:03,900
So assets, that's the main thing that's
on my write it over here. Assets.

1025
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:07,290
Okay.
After all the stock market is about,

1026
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:11,040
I mean finances a lot about
the stock market, bond markets,

1027
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:15,720
mortgage markets, those are all
assets that you buy that pay money,

1028
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,310
pay dividends later.

1029
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:20,880
So assets are things that pay
dividends at a later time.

1030
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:23,880
That's the critical thing that's missing.
And when we talk about finance,

1031
01:04:23,881 --> 01:04:26,460
we want to know what should the
value of the stock market be,

1032
01:04:26,461 --> 01:04:31,320
how much should a mortgage be worth?
And it will turn and, and um, okay,

1033
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,230
so those are the things we have to add.
Now how are we going to add them?

1034
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:37,620
It sounds like you might have to just
totally Redo the theory and start from

1035
01:04:37,621 --> 01:04:39,330
scratch and do something
totally different.

1036
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:43,050
How horrible that would be would
mean I also wasted three lectures.

1037
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:47,640
So Fisher said you don't really
have to change very much at all.

1038
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:53,070
So he said, number one time, how
do you put time in the model?

1039
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:55,500
Simply think of,

1040
01:04:56,730 --> 01:05:01,620
think of why as the same

1041
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:04,093
good

1042
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:08,510
as x,
but one period later.

1043
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:13,403
Okay,

1044
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:18,610
so fish are sad. You know, time isn't
such a big deal. Already got two goods.

1045
01:05:18,611 --> 01:05:23,350
You know, these old, these, these crazy
marginalist before me, they had good acts,

1046
01:05:23,351 --> 01:05:27,790
which was interesting and this very
boring good why? And so you know, things,

1047
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:31,930
it's not so clear how you can have
a time and everything in the model.

1048
01:05:31,931 --> 01:05:35,410
But I've already got two interesting
goods. X and Y, they're both, you know,

1049
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:40,690
entering on, on the scene with the
same symmetric properties. I mean,

1050
01:05:40,691 --> 01:05:44,230
no, neither one of them seems
more interesting or more
important than the other

1051
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:47,770
ones. So in fact maybe they're the same.
Good. It's just x and y is the same. Good.

1052
01:05:47,771 --> 01:05:51,790
It's one, one comes one period later.
Now next class we're going to talk about,

1053
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,620
you're not going to value
them the same amount,

1054
01:05:53,621 --> 01:05:55,750
the utility for x and
why won't be the same.

1055
01:05:55,750 --> 01:06:00,700
So here a obviously things more of x
than he does of why. And by the way, B,

1056
01:06:00,701 --> 01:06:05,200
she also thinks more of x then she
does about why. So why is that? Well,

1057
01:06:05,201 --> 01:06:09,160
if y is the same as x,
but a year later people are impatient.

1058
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:14,430
So the reason why a might like x better
than Y and B also is not because they're

1059
01:06:15,941 --> 01:06:18,080
different goods,
but because they're impatient.

1060
01:06:18,081 --> 01:06:19,270
So we're going to come to that later.

1061
01:06:19,271 --> 01:06:24,271
So we can have the idea that they're two
different time periods and the economy

1062
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:29,410
simply by a change of
notation and not, uh, not, uh,

1063
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:33,490
not introducing anything new at all.
Well,

1064
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:38,030
what about assets?
How can you put sob coming?

1065
01:06:38,031 --> 01:06:40,600
They're going to come back to that
in the next class. What about assets?

1066
01:06:40,601 --> 01:06:43,240
How can you introduce assets
into the economy? Well,

1067
01:06:43,241 --> 01:06:46,150
Fisher says what is the
essence of an asset?

1068
01:06:46,151 --> 01:06:51,151
The essence of an acid is
that it's something you hold
today because later it's

1069
01:06:52,361 --> 01:06:55,030
going to deliver you money
or goods or something.

1070
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:56,620
And we're not going to talk about money.

1071
01:06:56,621 --> 01:07:00,070
So we're imagining these
are all wheel acids. Um,

1072
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:04,380
so they're going to deliver
goods in the future. So asset,

1073
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:06,790
the definition of an asset is an asset.

1074
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:08,590
Okay?

1075
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:10,240
When we have to make it mathematical.

1076
01:07:10,241 --> 01:07:14,770
So the whole Fisher started the
society to make economics mathematical.

1077
01:07:14,771 --> 01:07:19,450
So an acid is literally something
that delivers goods in the future.

1078
01:07:19,451 --> 01:07:20,284
So an acid

1079
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,410
defined

1080
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,670
by its payoffs.

1081
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:29,253
Okay.

1082
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:32,890
The X and d y.

1083
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:38,050
So we could call that acid alpha
[inaudible] acid alpha is defined by its

1084
01:07:38,051 --> 01:07:39,820
payoffs,
the acts and

1085
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:43,300
Dyi. So it's going to pay a certain
amount of acts in a certain amount of why.

1086
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:46,390
That's all there is.
Now we're going to ask,

1087
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:50,470
do people actually know what the payoff
of why he's going to be if wise in the

1088
01:07:50,471 --> 01:07:52,060
future.
That means it hasn't happened yet.

1089
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:56,320
Do we really know what was is going
to be and so Fisher, so we have to,

1090
01:07:56,321 --> 01:08:00,820
and so you know, maybe we know less about
one asset, more about another asset.

1091
01:08:00,821 --> 01:08:05,290
So maybe one assets riskier than
another acid. So someone said risk.

1092
01:08:05,291 --> 01:08:07,360
Obviously that's going be a
very fundamental question,

1093
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:11,890
but before we come to risk,
if we don't have any risk yet,

1094
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,470
cause Fisher didn't know how to put it
in and we're going to start with his

1095
01:08:14,471 --> 01:08:16,370
model where there's no risk.
Okay.

1096
01:08:16,371 --> 01:08:20,810
Then if there's just today and tomorrow
and everybody's rational, everybody,

1097
01:08:20,811 --> 01:08:21,830
since there's no one certain,

1098
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:26,060
everybody wants to be able to anticipate
exactly what the dividends going to be.

1099
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:30,110
So the acid is no different from
what its dividend is going to be.

1100
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:33,170
Maybe it's paying something today and
also it's going to pay something tomorrow.

1101
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:37,430
So assets are defined by their dividends.
Nothing more than that.

1102
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:43,360
So if a model now becomes a model where
we have the aide Wri and then we have a

1103
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,441
Wii,

1104
01:08:48,441 --> 01:08:53,390
and then we have the goods is
before the endowments of the goods.

1105
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:57,020
But we've added a new thing,
which is we've added the acids,

1106
01:08:57,230 --> 01:09:00,920
d alpha acts and d l for y.

1107
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:02,450
Okay?

1108
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:04,880
So the ALFALFA's overall the assets,

1109
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:09,650
and we have to add everybody's
ownership of the assets to begin with.

1110
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,220
So we have to have theta,
I'm going to call it fate of Bar Alpha.

1111
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:15,203
Okay.

1112
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:17,840
Ate a bar.
I alpha.

1113
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:25,780
So how much of acid Alpha does I own?

1114
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:30,400
So that's the economy that
we're going to start with. Okay?

1115
01:09:30,401 --> 01:09:33,910
So we've made the model much more,
we made the model a bit more complicated.

1116
01:09:33,911 --> 01:09:35,050
We started what we were,

1117
01:09:35,051 --> 01:09:40,051
we did before with utilities
and endowments of chords.

1118
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:43,720
Now we're adding acids,
which pay off more goods and where,

1119
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:46,690
and of course people begin owning trees.
And stuff like that.

1120
01:09:46,691 --> 01:09:51,280
So a tree is an acid, it's going
to pay Apple's later on and people,

1121
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:53,890
various different people
own various different trees.

1122
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:58,840
So we've got to the old economy,
we add something new and now fishers,

1123
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:02,920
ingenious insight was that
if you think about this,

1124
01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:05,020
which we will for a little while,

1125
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:09,340
you'll be able to discover that you can
simplify this economy back down to the

1126
01:10:09,341 --> 01:10:10,570
economy we began with.

1127
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:14,830
So you can start talking about acids and
interest and all kinds of other things

1128
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:18,880
using the same analysis before.
So with my last thought here,

1129
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:24,310
what would you, what has interest
have to do with px over p? Why?

1130
01:10:24,311 --> 01:10:28,750
Suppose they're both. What does px over
p why? Suppose they're both apples.

1131
01:10:28,751 --> 01:10:32,260
So acts as an apple today.
Why is an apple next year?

1132
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:33,940
What does px over p?

1133
01:10:33,941 --> 01:10:38,860
Why it says how much an apple is worth
today relative to how much an apple was

1134
01:10:38,861 --> 01:10:40,410
worth tomorrow. So, so,

1135
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:45,430
so this is going to turn out to be
one plus the real interest rate.

1136
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:46,840
Fisher would call it.
Yeah.

1137
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:53,810
Because if Px is more than p
y, let's say px is a, you know,

1138
01:10:53,811 --> 01:10:58,100
20% more than p. Why what it means
is by giving up one apple today,

1139
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,380
you can get 1.2 apples tomorrow.

1140
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,810
That's just what happens when
you put money in the bank.

1141
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:06,320
You give up something today, you get
exactly the same thing back next period.

1142
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:08,480
But more of it.
So you see,

1143
01:11:08,481 --> 01:11:11,900
just by having time and the
price is like we had before,

1144
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:14,940
you're going to see very how interest,
acids,

1145
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:17,520
everything is going to start
coming into play very quickly.

1146
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,960
So I didn't put the problem set on the
web yet cause I wasn't sure how far we'll

1147
01:11:21,961 --> 01:11:22,530
get,

1148
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:27,450
but I'll put it on in a couple hours
and we'll start again on Thursday.
