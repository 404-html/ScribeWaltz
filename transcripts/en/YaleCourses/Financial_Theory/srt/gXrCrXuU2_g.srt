1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:05,520
No.
The subject of today's lecture is hedging.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,390
So this is the sweat hedge funds do.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,100
It's what almost everyone on Wall Street
does nowadays. At least to some extent,

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,310
say half the people I'm lost
where you do it nowadays. Uh,

5
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:21,960
it was hardly done at all in the past.
So first of all,

6
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:24,270
just to mention what a hedge fund is.

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,980
I Hedge Fund is a firm that manages money.

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,280
And why is it different from any
other firm that manages money? Well,

9
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:34,920
the definition of hedge fund
basically has three parts.

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,810
One is that hedge funds
hedge, okay, now, uh,

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,390
I'll say what that is in a second.
Secondly,

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,420
hedge funds use borrowed money in
addition to their investors money to buy

13
00:00:48,871 --> 00:00:51,030
acids.
So they do what's called leveraging,

14
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:54,570
which is going to be an important
subject for the last few lectures of the

15
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:59,220
course. And thirdly, they charge
their investors very high fees.

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,070
That's basically the definition of a
hedge fund because they're supposed to be

17
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:06,660
so good at what they do. They can charge
high fees and still get the investors.

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,610
So what is hedging?

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hedging is the idea that you want
to cancel out some of your risks.

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,530
So for instance, you might know that
a company's not going to default,

21
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,040
whereas the rest, whereas the rest of
the market thinks it is going to default.

22
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,820
So you know the company's worth more
than the rest of the market thinks.

23
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,550
So you might be tempted to
buy the con the company,

24
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,030
but if the interest rate were to change,

25
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,220
say go way up and the company's paying
has constant, uh, cash payments.

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,450
If the interest rate goes way up and
the company has constant cash payments,

27
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,600
you could end up losing money
anyway because you know,

28
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:48,660
the present value is going to go down just
because the interest rate has gone up.

29
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,020
So what a hedger would do is
the hedger would say, look,

30
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:57,021
I'm relying on my expertise as a evaluator
to realize there's no default risk.

31
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,820
I want to bet that there's no
default risk in this company.

32
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:03,960
It's not going to default.

33
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,680
I don't want to bet on which way interest
rates are going to go because I don't

34
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:09,570
know which way interest
rates are going to go.

35
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,380
So I want to hedge myself against that.
So to take,

36
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,810
to take a,
sorry,

37
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:19,260
I'm just starting here at a lot of hello.

38
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,120
Sorry. Hard to talk when everyone
else is talking. So if, uh, if you,

39
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,800
um,
so what is,

40
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,360
what is hedging the risk mean means it
means no matter which way the risk factor

41
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,150
goes, you're going to still end
up with the same amount of money.

42
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,880
So the first person to do this,
uh,

43
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:43,881
and call himself a hedge fund was
somebody named Jones in the 1940s.

44
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,190
And he was a stock picker who,

45
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,520
which try to find the best
possible stock to buy.

46
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:54,930
So beforehand people would say,
okay, four does a great auto company.

47
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,240
We're going to buy Ford.
Uh,

48
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,810
the trouble is that Ford May in fact
turn out to be the best auto company,

49
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,430
but because the whole economy
collapsed, it may be that Ford, uh,

50
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,140
collapsed with the rest of the economy,

51
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,370
even though it did better than all the
other auto companies. So at Jones said is,

52
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:13,870
I'm not going to just buy Ford.

53
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,950
What I'm going to do is I'm going to
buy Ford and I'm going to sell General

54
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,100
Motors.

55
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,270
So that way I'm going to be betting
not on where the forward is better than

56
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:26,140
General Motors. And in addition, whether
the whole economy is going to go up,

57
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,350
I only want to bet on where the
Ford is better than General Motors.

58
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,620
So if the whole economy goes down,
Ford and General Motors,

59
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:35,740
we'll go down together.
So what you own in Ford,

60
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,350
you won't own something
as valuable anymore,

61
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:42,190
but what you owe by having sold general
motors short also won't be as valuable.

62
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,740
So you're what you've
bought and what you've sold.

63
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:48,310
We'll cancel each other out and you won't
have lost any money. On the other hand,

64
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,280
if Ford ends up doing
better than General Motors,

65
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,090
you'll have gained more with Ford,
then he'll have lost with General Motors.

66
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:57,400
So whether the economy goes up or down,

67
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,520
if the gap between Ford and
General Motors stays the same,

68
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:01,930
you won't lose or win money.

69
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:06,490
So you're hedged against
general changes in the economy.

70
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,150
You're only gonna make or lose money
depending on the spread between Ford and

71
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:10,984
General Motors.

72
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,100
So you've cancelled out the economy wide
risk and you're only holding one risk,

73
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:19,540
which you really think
that you've understood. So
that's what, uh, hedging is.

74
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,100
So I'm going to now show you that hedging
is actually a slightly delicate thing.

75
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:27,260
It's quite complicated and
we're going to learn the,

76
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,500
the technique of dynamic hedging.

77
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,630
Okay.

78
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,910
And why is dynamic hedging so important?

79
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,490
Dynamic hedging is so important because
there's so many things that can happen

80
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:44,940
in the future. And as I said, for
example, if you hold a mortgage,

81
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,240
you may think the mortgage
is more valuable because
you know people aren't going

82
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:50,940
to default and the rest of the economy
thinks they're going to default.

83
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,150
On the other hand, the value
of the mortgage will change
with the interest rate.

84
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,240
So you want to protect yourself
against the interest rate change,

85
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,020
but it's not just the interest
rate change. You know,

86
00:05:01,021 --> 00:05:03,630
over 10 years or 30 years,
the life of the mortgage,

87
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:06,270
they're going to be a huge
number of interest rates changes.

88
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:10,410
There'll be a whole path of interest rate
changes and the and the mortgage will

89
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:14,490
be paying different cash flows along the
whole path and over 30 years. You know,

90
00:05:14,491 --> 00:05:16,710
even if you only think
of one change a day,

91
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,470
there's an exponentially
growing set of changes.

92
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,450
So there's an exponential number of pads.

93
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,230
You'll never be able to
equalize your cash flows,

94
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:28,650
you would think over every single path.
They're just too many of them.

95
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:34,080
But dynamic hedging says you don't have
to equalize over every path from the

96
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:35,160
very beginning.
That is,

97
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:39,240
you don't have to hold a portfolio at
the very beginning that equalizes your

98
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:41,160
cash flows by the end on every path.

99
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:46,140
You only have to equalize your cashflow
one step at a time and then dynamically

100
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:47,790
change your hedge.
Okay?

101
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,700
So it's a much easier thing to hedge
than it sounds at first glance.

102
00:05:50,701 --> 00:05:54,030
So I want to illustrate that because you
can't know what that means yet until we

103
00:05:54,031 --> 00:05:57,060
see an example.
So let's start with a very easy thing.

104
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,840
Understand the world series
where we started with before.

105
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,690
So you have some expertise.
In fact,

106
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:06,770
there are other people besides you have
the same expertise, these other bookies.

107
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,030
You all know the Yankees have a 60%
chance of winning every game against the

108
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:11,864
Phillies and you,

109
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,230
and let's just assume for simplicity that
the world series is only going to take

110
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:18,950
a couple weeks. The interest rate is
zero over such a short period of time.

111
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:21,380
You don't care whether you get the
money now or at the end of two weeks.

112
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:26,050
It's just so long as you get it. And
secondly, um, and you can borrow or lend,

113
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:31,010
you know, zero interest over those
short number of days. And secondly,

114
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,170
um, you know that the
probability of winning is 60%.

115
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,120
Now suppose that some naive
person comes to you and says,

116
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,280
you know,
I'm a Phillies fan.

117
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:47,810
I want to bet at even odds that the
Phillies are going to win for $100.

118
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,990
So you're going to now get a payoff that's
minus a hundred dollars at the end of

119
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:57,980
game seven, assuming I counted,
right? So this is, uh, the start.

120
00:06:57,981 --> 00:07:02,750
So this would be game one here.
So that's one, two, three,

121
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:06,500
four, five, six, seven. Okay.

122
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:09,830
So at the end of games, by the end of
game seven, if you played it to the,

123
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,440
and you would have made
$100 if the Yankees won a
majority of the games and you

124
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:17,780
would have lost $100 of the Yankees,
didn't win a majority of the Games.

125
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,710
So how much is that worth to you?
Well,

126
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,740
obviously it's worth a lot more than
$20 because if they only played one game

127
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:29,390
and the Yankees had a
60% chance of winning,

128
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,130
the expected payoff for the Yankees would
be of that bet for one game would be

129
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:36,620
$20 right?
Because you know,

130
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:41,621
in one game a 0.6 chance of a hundred
and appoint four chance of minus a

131
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:46,880
hundred, that gives you an
expectation of 2060 minus 40 is 20.

132
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,130
However,
we're playing a seven game series.

133
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:52,430
The whole point of playing along series
is that the Yankees are more likely to

134
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,490
win. That's, you know, the better
teams more likely to win. And in fact,

135
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:59,420
we know that the expect by doing this
backward induction calculation, uh,

136
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:03,320
we know that the expected
winnings for the Yankees is $42.

137
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,540
However, the Yankees, you know, you can
lose $100 if the Phillies just got lucky,

138
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,960
you could lose as well as when $100.
You don't want to face that risk.

139
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,300
So what could you do?
Well,

140
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,880
the simplest thing to do is to
go to another bookie and say,

141
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,990
I want to bet on the world series
with this other bookie and if that,

142
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:25,190
and so if the book,

143
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:29,720
he is willing to make a bet
with you for a hunt, you know,

144
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:32,150
for the whole series. Okay, so the book,

145
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:36,380
he has to be pretty sophisticated and
do the same calculation the bookie is

146
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:37,670
going to give you,
you know,

147
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:42,140
let you bet however you want
to at the right odds. Okay?

148
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:46,040
So, um, what would you do?

149
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,830
So here you can win a hundred.
There are only two outcomes.

150
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,840
You can win a hundred or you
can lose a hundred. Okay.

151
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:58,560
Now the odds of winning the game.
I forgot to say that this series,

152
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:02,550
we figured this out before.
Oh dear. What were the odds?

153
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,110
I hope I have another one of
these world series things. Um

154
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,800
Oh labor.
Okay.

155
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,230
So what are the odds of the Yankees
are going to win the world series?

156
00:09:14,231 --> 00:09:16,510
We calculated this before.
Do you remember what it was?

157
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,920
Okay,

158
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,570
well we know some probability p times a
hundred put some probability one minus

159
00:09:23,571 --> 00:09:26,720
teaching minus a hundred gives you 42.

160
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:32,050
So p times a hundred plus one minus
p times minus a hundred equals 42

161
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,530
approximately. That's 42, right?
So we know that uh, therefore

162
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,980
to p times a hundred.

163
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:44,750
Yeah.

164
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:49,700
Okay.
Two P times 100 equals 142.

165
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,680
So,
um,

166
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,100
p equals 142 over a hundred
a divide over times two,

167
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:02,390
which equals about
0.71. Okay. So you know,

168
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,220
so this other book you
would have calculated,

169
00:10:04,221 --> 00:10:08,060
the odds are 71% that the Yankees
are going to win the world series.

170
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:10,310
And we calculated this a few classes ago,

171
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,690
the [inaudible] 71% chance of
winning the world series. Okay?

172
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:18,000
So if you went to another bookie who
could do this calculation, the other book,

173
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:23,001
he would be willing to give you
odds of 71% Yankees versus 39% um,

174
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:29,000
Phillies. So you could just unload this
whole bet and get $42 for sure. In fact,

175
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:30,500
what would you bet with the other guy?

176
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,080
What, what would, what would
you bet with the other bookie?

177
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,460
What would you do if you could
bet on the whole world series,

178
00:10:40,461 --> 00:10:43,490
somebody suggested that he was sitting
over there at the end of the last class,

179
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,030
what would you do if you could bet on
the whole world series with the other

180
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,890
bookie,
what pat would you make?

181
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,210
You know that the bed is
giving you $42 on expectation.

182
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:56,120
The trouble is some of the time it's
giving you a hundred some of the time it's

183
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:58,640
giving you minus a hundred you
don't want to fix this risk.

184
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,960
You want to end up with $42 for
sure. Now, how can you do that?

185
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:12,820
Well if you did minus 68 here,
that would equal 42

186
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,970
okay.
And if you did plus a 142 here,

187
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:24,030
now it also equal 42 so could you figure
out a way of betting with the other

188
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:24,651
book?

189
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:29,651
He's 142 versus 68 you win 142 if the
Phillies win and you lose 68 if the a

190
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,070
Yankees win.

191
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,313
Yeah,

192
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,650
that's not 30 to 42 by the way.

193
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,673
MMM.

194
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,513
Okay.
Can you make a bet?

195
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,830
What would another big book he'd
be willing to give you this?

196
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,960
What's the answer?

197
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,690
The answer is yes.
How do you know the other book?

198
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:03,280
It would be willing to give you this bet.

199
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:13,850
Okay.

200
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:18,850
What is p times 50 what is p times 42
plus one minus p times 42 it's 42 what's p

201
00:12:22,161 --> 00:12:26,840
times a hundred plus one minus p times
minus 100 it's also 42 so therefore

202
00:12:26,841 --> 00:12:29,840
what's p times this plus
one minus p times that?

203
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,370
Yeah,

204
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,850
zero. Okay. So at the
odds p and one minus P,

205
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:39,850
this bed is perfectly fair.
So the other book,

206
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:44,851
he would say that's the odd 71% to 39%
that's exactly what these odds are.

207
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,790
So if,
if p times this plus one minus p times,

208
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:52,630
that is 42 and PT times this
plus one minus p times to that,

209
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:57,220
that's obviously 42 must be p times this
plus one minus p times. That is zero.

210
00:12:57,221 --> 00:13:00,610
In other words, at the odds, P and
one minus P, this is a fair bet.

211
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:04,300
So the other book he ought to be able
to would give you those odds. Okay?

212
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:07,750
So that's what hedging
is in its simplest form.

213
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,300
We haven't had to do anything dynamic.
The guy,

214
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,800
some guys willing to bet on the world
series with you so you know that he's done

215
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:18,880
something wrong in his calculations.
He's got the wrong p. So you want, okay,

216
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,070
so you can take advantage
of the situation. You're,

217
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,010
you know that P is higher than he does.
On the other hand,

218
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:27,160
there's still God in the
background and luck, you know,

219
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:28,690
which might make the Phillies win.

220
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,800
And so you don't want to subject
yourself to that risk. So what do you do?

221
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:36,370
You Do, you take the bat,
the advantageous bet,

222
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,860
but you put together with
the advantageous bet,

223
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,220
a hedging bet where you're
betting on the wrong team,

224
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,640
the team you think is going to lose. Okay,
but you're betting on the wrong team,

225
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:49,930
but this time it fair rods on the wrong
team and so you're transforming your

226
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:53,560
risky pay off. I'll be it with
very favorable odds. You know,

227
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:55,660
pee we just said was 0.71

228
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,910
you're taking your risky payoff and
turning it into a safe payoff of 42 no

229
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:07,570
matter what. That's the essence
of hedging. In order to do that,

230
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:11,920
you might have to bet the opposite way
that you think is going to turn out. Okay.

231
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:14,020
So there's principle number one.

232
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,830
So I'll let me pause and see if there
are any questions for that about that.

233
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:21,790
The idea is that there's something you
know that you can take advantage of,

234
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,640
but life is more complicated.
The knowing one thing,

235
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,520
knowing one thing, namely what
P is. Life also involves, um,

236
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,680
all kinds of other
things that might happen.

237
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,910
You want to insulate yourself from those
other things and concentrate entirely

238
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:41,170
on what you know about p and one minus p
and therefore assure yourself of a bed,

239
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,150
a 42 no matter what,

240
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:46,270
and you're taking advantage of the fact
that other people will also be able to

241
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,450
bet, uh, at p with you, okay? In this one,

242
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,040
outsider doesn't understand
that the bookies are willing to

243
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,960
take odds of p. He's offering odds of a
half, which are crazy. It's a big gap. 71,

244
00:14:56,961 --> 00:15:01,910
29 to pee. So you can take
42 of his dollars for sure.

245
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:08,400
Okay, so now, um, let's go to,

246
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:13,590
uh, okay, so this is hedging.
It's also an arbitrage.

247
00:15:13,591 --> 00:15:15,300
This is a hedging

248
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,450
created a pure arbitrage,

249
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,470
okay?

250
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:27,370
Because now that you did, in this
case, it's done even better than a,

251
00:15:27,371 --> 00:15:28,750
in my example with Ford,

252
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:33,310
because you've taken now
a bet and transformed that
we're an expectation you're

253
00:15:33,311 --> 00:15:36,040
going to win into a bat where
you can't possibly lose.

254
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,760
Okay?

255
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,121
Okay.

256
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:44,121
Now suppose that these other brokers
weren't as clever as you suppose that the

257
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:48,360
other bro. Okay? So that's hedging.
Now we're going to do dynamic hedging.

258
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,150
Suppose the other brokers,
they're not as smart as you.

259
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:54,540
They don't know how to build these trees.
They can't do backward induction.

260
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,110
They just know the odds are 60% that
the Yankees are going to win any game

261
00:15:58,111 --> 00:16:00,840
against the Phillies.
Now what would you do?

262
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,560
Okay?

263
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,780
Okay.
You can't go to another broker and say,

264
00:16:04,781 --> 00:16:06,910
I want to bet on the
whole seven game series.

265
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:10,480
The guy's going to say it's just too
complicated for me. I'm a simple man.

266
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:14,890
I make a simple living. I just do
one game bets. Tell me, you know,

267
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,740
I'll let you bet any game
you want. You can, you know,

268
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,760
you tell me what you want to bet. We'll
bet one game at a time, 60 40 odds,

269
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:25,590
the whole series. You don't as much more
complicated for me. So what could you,

270
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,640
is there anything you can do now?
What can you do now?

271
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,610
So now you have to do
something more complicated,

272
00:16:33,611 --> 00:16:35,200
which is called dynamic hedging.

273
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,033
Okay?

274
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,980
So we started to talk about this
last time. So what is dying?

275
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,070
So what would you do?

276
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,100
You only now have the opportunity of
protecting yourself against bad luck by

277
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:54,160
betting one game at a time with these
other brokers. So what should you do?

278
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:58,550
Okay,

279
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,730
well,
let's look at this picture here.

280
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,460
You know that this bet of plus 100 minus
a hundred by doing backward induction

281
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,090
is worth 42.
So if you were a trader,

282
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,830
a hedge fund manager,

283
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:16,790
you would be marking your
position at 42 you're expecting.

284
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,040
Now you've just made a trade,
which you know,

285
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:23,060
on average it's going to make you
$42. Of course, if you had bad luck,

286
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:25,610
you could end up losing a hundred dollars.
You know,

287
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,920
which means you're going to go out of
business, you're going to be fired,

288
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,420
your name's going to be in the newspaper,

289
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:33,110
you're going to be probably sued
by your investors, okay. Or,

290
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:39,220
or you can, um, we haven't been sued
by any investors, or you can, uh,

291
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:43,010
you, you, you know, you might make
$100. Now you don't want to face that.

292
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,010
You want to hedge yourself,
protect yourself, so you're
going to make the money,

293
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:50,340
for sure. Now, some people don't hedge.
They say, you know, when you hedge,

294
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,910
you're betting against yourself and
you know, something bad can happen.

295
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:55,680
The hedge might go
negative, right? I mean,

296
00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:00,420
it may be that the Yankees win just as
you think, but because of you've hedged,

297
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:03,390
your not going to get $100,
you only can get $42.

298
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:07,440
So the essence of hedging is you give
something up on the upside to get

299
00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:08,760
something on the downside.

300
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,410
Some people don't like hedging because
they're giving something up. Okay?

301
00:18:13,411 --> 00:18:14,400
So you're giving something up.

302
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:17,520
The point is you're getting something
back on the downside and you're making it

303
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:21,600
so you're locking in your profit.
So hedging is a good thing.

304
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:25,140
So people who don't hedge,
I think they're just very simple minded.

305
00:18:25,141 --> 00:18:27,150
So there are a lot of people who
still don't hedge. But anyway,

306
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:30,990
there's a revolution in financial
fought in the last 30 years,

307
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,200
anticipated by Ford.
But we didn't really get,

308
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,290
people didn't really catch on until
the 70s, uh, that you should have.

309
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:42,840
So how can you hedge this if you can
only bet one time, one game at a time?

310
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,640
That was the question we dealt with
last time. What should you do? Well,

311
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,090
you see the principles we've
learned so far. Tell us what to do.

312
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,290
You started here thinking on average
you're going to make $42 you should be

313
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,460
marking your position,

314
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:03,490
you know correctly that it's worth
$42 now if you win the first game,

315
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,830
you know you're at a big advantage,
the Yankees are up again,

316
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,240
and by backward induction,

317
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:13,241
we know that then your position
will be worth $64 okay?

318
00:19:13,491 --> 00:19:17,600
If you lose,
your position will be worth $8.

319
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:23,050
Now what is 60% of 64 and f plus 40%
of nine it's 40 to 60% of 64 is 38.4

320
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,461
okay,

321
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:37,410
so you're 42 and you could go
with 60% probability to 60 wife,

322
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,550
can't remember the number,

323
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,700
64 or down to 0.9 40% sorry,

324
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,870
I'm getting senile.
Nine with 40% probability.

325
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:53,871
So 60% times that is a 38.4 plus 40% of
nine his point is a 3.6 and the two add

326
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:03,030
up to 42 okay. So that's why the, okay,

327
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:07,110
so to say that the value's worth 42
how did you get the 42 we were doing

328
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:08,160
backward induction,

329
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:13,370
we took 60% of that plus 40% of that and
we got 42 so if you're marking yourself

330
00:20:14,161 --> 00:20:18,480
to market after the first game of the
series, you'll have to say to the world,

331
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:23,130
admit to the world that you're either now
worth $64 or you've gotten crushed and

332
00:20:23,131 --> 00:20:26,790
you're down to $8 that already
might get you fired. You know,

333
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,550
going from 42 to eight
that's a pretty drastic Wass.

334
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,230
So even the first day you're, you'd
be, if you have to mark to market,

335
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:36,480
you're going to be revealing to
the world that you screwed up.

336
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,540
And younger position only eight
you've told all your investors,

337
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,130
you've done this brilliant thing there.

338
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:44,460
They're up $42 the next day you're going
to have to tell them, well, I'm sorry,

339
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:49,180
you're only up $8 they're going to
be very upset. So what would you do?

340
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,810
You know what to do?
What would you do?

341
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:06,040
What hedge? Good answer.
How would you hedge?

342
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,350
Right?
So you'd go,

343
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,583
MMM,

344
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,540
so what? What? What'd you say? You go

345
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,693
last time.

346
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,580
So here, this is minus, not
and all this is nine, right?

347
00:21:23,581 --> 00:21:28,320
So you'd go plus 33 minus 22 okay,

348
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:33,321
so that's equal to 42 and that's also
equal to 42 so how can you do this at a

349
00:21:34,081 --> 00:21:36,720
fair? Is it fair odds
to do this? Well, yes,

350
00:21:36,721 --> 00:21:41,721
it has to be fair odds to do this because
60% of 64 plus 40% of nine is indeed

351
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:47,601
40 to 60% of 42 plus 40% of 42 obviously
it's 42 so therefore the difference,

352
00:21:49,381 --> 00:21:53,460
60% of this plus 40% of that must be
zero. So in other words, it's fair rods.

353
00:21:53,461 --> 00:21:56,790
And sure enough, this is obviously
three to two odds, right?

354
00:21:56,791 --> 00:22:00,060
60 40 means you're betting at three
to two dogs. That's three to two odds.

355
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,960
So it is a fair bet.
So the other book,

356
00:22:01,961 --> 00:22:04,860
he who's willing to bed at three to two
odds, it's going to give you this bet.

357
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,280
So again, you, you think
the Yankees are going to,

358
00:22:08,281 --> 00:22:11,700
when you go to the other and you
make a bet with the naive Philly fan,

359
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,930
you're betting the Yankees are going to,

360
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:17,931
when you go to your broker friend
and you bet against your Yankees,

361
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:19,681
you know you're,

362
00:22:19,681 --> 00:22:24,390
you're putting down 22 you're going to
lose $22 if the Yankees win and win 33 if

363
00:22:24,391 --> 00:22:26,790
the Phillies win,
you're betting against yourself.

364
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,210
But of course you're betting against
yourself to a smaller extent.

365
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:35,390
Then you're betting against the other
guy and therefore you still locked in $42

366
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,310
okay,
so now we don't have to go any further.

367
00:22:40,311 --> 00:22:44,180
You would only be confusing to go further.
And I usually go further and then,

368
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:47,270
so it's just be complicated.
If you can do something once,

369
00:22:47,271 --> 00:22:48,770
you can do it many times.

370
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:52,880
So you can by making
the right hedging bet,

371
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:57,710
you can lock in a profit
of 42 up here and up here,

372
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:58,761
okay?

373
00:22:58,761 --> 00:23:03,140
But that means you can lock it in going
forward until the very end because you

374
00:23:03,141 --> 00:23:05,570
can keep repeating that
hedge over and over again.

375
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:12,840
Okay? So maybe I'd better go one step
further. You don't really believe me.

376
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,930
So what could you do?
Going from here to here?

377
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:19,410
Will we average of here
and here is eight okay.

378
00:23:19,411 --> 00:23:24,411
But of course you've co is nine about
nine you've collected $33 don't forget

379
00:23:24,601 --> 00:23:29,160
from your, you're hedging bet.
So although this says nine,

380
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,120
you've got the 33 in the background.
So it's 42 okay. But it's nine.

381
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:34,620
So what you want to do,
this is not,

382
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:38,820
you just want to transform this and this
until nine once you've transformed this

383
00:23:38,821 --> 00:23:42,330
and this and to nine, okay?
You, which you can do, right?

384
00:23:42,331 --> 00:23:46,040
Because 60% of this plus
40% of that is nine.

385
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,890
So the other broker is going to,

386
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:52,930
you can do an offloading hedging bet
with another broker at 60 40 odds to get

387
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:57,830
nine for sure. Here. Why is that? Because
60% of this plus 40% of that is nine.

388
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,690
Okay.
So therefore there must be offsetting a,

389
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,120
a bad he'd take that gave you nine for
sure in both cases because the offsetting

390
00:24:05,121 --> 00:24:08,750
bet would also be valued at
zero according to 60 40 odds.

391
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,480
So you can transform this
and this and to nines.

392
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:13,610
But don't forget you've been paid the 33.

393
00:24:13,611 --> 00:24:18,611
So actually this is 44 42 and 42 so you
can keep 42 and 42 going forever and by

394
00:24:20,811 --> 00:24:23,960
the end you'll have 42 forever.
So that's what dynamic hedging is.

395
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:26,270
It's as simple as that. Okay? Yes.

396
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:31,771
Yeah.

397
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:36,550
So how do you make money in a hedging?

398
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,550
You affectively,
we're betting

399
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:41,660
okay

400
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:46,220
against the Phillies fan at 50% odds and
you've got your broker who's willing to

401
00:24:46,221 --> 00:24:50,810
give you 60% odds and you're
exploiting that gap. Okay. So let's,

402
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,620
uh, let's do a nother eggs. So, okay,

403
00:24:54,621 --> 00:24:56,210
so it's an excellent
question you're asking.

404
00:24:56,211 --> 00:24:57,710
So I haven't answered this question yet.

405
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,870
I want to give another example
to answer his question. So what,

406
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,940
what is really going on with the hedging?
I mean who, what am I relying on? I mean,

407
00:25:04,941 --> 00:25:08,060
how many brokers do I have to deal
with the hedge, what's going on here?

408
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,460
So I've given an example of a world
series where it's very simple, uh,

409
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,820
to figure out what to do.

410
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:18,170
So now I want to give an example of a

411
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:20,890
yeah.

412
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,380
Of A,
um,

413
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,383
yeah.

414
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,680
Okay. I want to give them
that example of a bond.

415
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:32,640
Okay.

416
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,250
Okay. So it doesn't matter
what bond, I have to confess,

417
00:25:35,251 --> 00:25:39,990
I haven't done this in
advance. Okay. So what is the,

418
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:47,250
okay, so here we have a, a
year, we have a 30 year bond,

419
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:51,570
8% 30 year bond. Okay. And it, um,

420
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,820
it's an 8% 30 year bond.

421
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:03,643
Okay.

422
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:09,810
Um, it's an 8% 30 year bond. So,

423
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,600
uh,

424
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,840
okay. So we know what its payment is and
now if the guy, if the, if the homeowner,

425
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:22,940
homeowners are all perfectly perfectly,
you know, uh, not paying attention,

426
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:25,700
the bond is going to be
worth some amount of money.

427
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,110
Okay. So here are the interest
rates. And I forgot to say,

428
00:26:30,111 --> 00:26:33,500
so we have to assume what the risk is so
we know. So in fact, what does this mean?

429
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:38,480
We know that the risk is a,
we know that the,

430
00:26:38,481 --> 00:26:42,320
that the uh, risk is a six. The, the,

431
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:47,130
the interest rate starts at 6%
and it has a 20% volatility.

432
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,380
Okay?
So what does that tell us?

433
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,860
It tells us that the interest rates
could go up or down by this amount.

434
00:26:55,510 --> 00:27:00,430
Now we've assumed that the odds
that it can go up or down are 50 50.

435
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:01,541
Okay.

436
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:05,860
So we've assumed that everybody thinks
the odds are 50 50 that the interest rate

437
00:27:05,861 --> 00:27:10,810
could go up or down. That's an
assumption. And so now I'm going to make,

438
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,060
okay,
we assumed that the odds are 50 50.

439
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:18,150
Let's assume that everybody is
willing to trade you 50 50 odds.

440
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,560
Okay? So what is the,
what is that right? Mean?

441
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,070
This is like your other broker.
Okay. So the interest rate is here,

442
00:27:31,071 --> 00:27:32,030
our zero,

443
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:37,330
it can go up to our zero times up or it
can go down to our zero times some down.

444
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,720
Okay. And up. Remember is
you know, up by the way,

445
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:49,190
this equals r zero e to the volatility,

446
00:27:49,191 --> 00:27:54,191
times e to the drift and down equals r
zero e to the minus volatility e to the

447
00:27:57,231 --> 00:28:01,790
drift. It doesn't matter, our
zero can go up or it can go down.

448
00:28:01,791 --> 00:28:04,400
So you as bigger than one D
is less than one probably.

449
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,200
And so we see examples of that.

450
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:11,710
Now I'm making an assumption here that
the odds are are a half and a half and

451
00:28:11,751 --> 00:28:16,751
that everybody understands and is willing
to bet on these odds of a half and a

452
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:17,450
half.

453
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:22,340
So betting on an interest rate move is
called that kind of betting on interest

454
00:28:22,341 --> 00:28:26,110
rate.
Interest rates

455
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,730
means trading,

456
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,450
uh,
interest rate derivatives.

457
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,610
Okay.

458
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:40,000
All right.

459
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So there are a bunch of ways that you
can trade in the interest rate market to

460
00:28:46,271 --> 00:28:50,170
get a dollar if the interest rate goes
up to this number in exchange for losing

461
00:28:50,171 --> 00:28:53,860
a dollar, if it goes down
to this number. Okay.

462
00:28:53,861 --> 00:28:58,510
And these things are called swaps and
they're called interest rate derivatives

463
00:28:58,511 --> 00:29:00,930
and they're called a whole
bunch of other things, which I,

464
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,100
it's going to take too long to explain.
Okay.

465
00:29:03,101 --> 00:29:07,510
But so let's suppose that you can go
out into the interest rate derivative

466
00:29:07,511 --> 00:29:12,400
market and simply trade a security
that'll pay a dollar. Things go up, uh,

467
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:16,810
you know, or you can buy another security
that'll pay a dollar of things go down.

468
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,440
Now, what is the price of this
security that pays a dollar?

469
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,940
If the interest rates go up,

470
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,850
let's say they can only go up
or down to one of two values.

471
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,340
So what would somebody,
what would it be? The cost.

472
00:29:27,341 --> 00:29:30,960
If everyone agrees the odds
are 50% of getting out peer,

473
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:35,380
what is the price today going to be of
getting a dollar if the interest rate

474
00:29:35,381 --> 00:29:36,214
goes up?

475
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,633
Okay,

476
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,040
excellent.

477
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:46,960
Who said that? Perfect. Okay.
I didn't expect anyone to
say that so fast. So right,

478
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,220
so the,
the pro,

479
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:53,250
the price here we could write is 0.5
divided by one plus r zero and this price

480
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,120
is going to be going down,

481
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:03,100
is going to be 0.5 divided
by one plus r zero k. Now,

482
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,230
how did he figure that out?
Well,

483
00:30:05,231 --> 00:30:09,190
the odds are 50% of going up
here on 50% of going down here,

484
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:12,220
but don't forget you're getting the
money later and this is a one period

485
00:30:12,221 --> 00:30:15,940
interest rate one plus r
zero. So therefore, uh,

486
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:20,050
what you'd be willing to pay here
is 50% of the dollar that you'll get

487
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,910
discounted by one plus r zero.

488
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:26,800
What you'd paid here for that is 50% of
the dollar you'd be paid discounted by

489
00:30:26,801 --> 00:30:31,600
one plus r zero. Okay, so exactly right.

490
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:36,970
But now these are like the
world series game by game odds,

491
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:41,200
they're going to change depending on where
you are in the tree because if you go

492
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:43,540
here in the tree,
you've got a higher interest rate.

493
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:48,250
So it's going to be 0.5 divided
by one plus r u or something,

494
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:52,330
which is a bigger number. Okay. So
the price of betting on a dollar,

495
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:55,510
you know what you have to pay to get
a dollar. If interest rates go up,

496
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:00,280
it's going to be, um, more
here than it is here. Say,

497
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:02,920
because you're going to still
have 50% chance of getting here,

498
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:05,800
but you're discounting by
higher interest rates. So, okay,

499
00:31:05,801 --> 00:31:07,840
so this is a slightly Sigler,
but not much.

500
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:12,490
It's like the broker in the world
series who gained by Game Day by day,

501
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:15,760
there's the interest rate derivative
market, and they're willing to trade you.

502
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,670
They're willing to let you bet on which
way the interest rates are going to go.

503
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:24,730
Okay, so what have we got now? We've
got this mortgage that's sitting there.

504
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:29,671
Okay,

505
00:31:29,671 --> 00:31:34,671
so let's say that you know that the
mortgage is owned by a very rational guy.

506
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:41,923
Oh,

507
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:47,310
you know, the mortgage is owned by a
very, you know, the, the, the homeowner,

508
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:51,270
he's not the owner of the mortgage.
The homeowners are very rational people.

509
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:56,580
The market is very foolish. This
is an exaggeration. The market,

510
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,960
Mike, thank all the homeowner,
you know, he's got this,

511
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,800
the homeowner's never does anything.
The market things.

512
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:06,940
So they think the bond is worth
120 but your much, you, you know,

513
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,810
you studied prepayments much
more than the market does.

514
00:32:09,811 --> 00:32:13,080
You realize that the homeowners aren't
going to just sit there, you know,

515
00:32:13,081 --> 00:32:16,200
dumb Lee paying whatever they owe.
If the interest rates go down,

516
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:20,400
they're going to prepay.
So in fact the mortgage is only worth 98.

517
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,980
Okay.
So the market thinks it's worth a hundred.

518
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,930
The market thinks it's worth a hundred.

519
00:32:25,931 --> 00:32:29,110
The market understands the interest rate
probabilities and is willing to give

520
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:31,690
interest rate risk.
They agree with you about that.

521
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,630
You don't know anything more about
interest rates in the market. Does.

522
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,890
What you do know is you know something
about the prepayments that the doesn't

523
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:44,891
know and so you and all the bond is
really worth 98 instead of 120 okay.

524
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:48,830
So what,
what should you do now?

525
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:53,831
Let's suppose that the
market is actually treating.

526
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,710
So what the market things market thinks,

527
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:03,410
market thinks mortgage

528
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,510
is equal to a 30 year bond,

529
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:14,930
30 year, a 30 year, um, you know,

530
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:19,820
30 year. Uh, well okay. It's
not actually a bond. Okay.

531
00:33:19,821 --> 00:33:22,170
Cause it doesn't have a principal
at the end. So the market,

532
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,590
so I'm going to have to do a different
sheet here to get it together.

533
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,650
Don't the market, thanks
mortgage, never prepays.

534
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:36,320
Now let's suppose that what you can trade
in the market is you can trade these

535
00:33:36,321 --> 00:33:40,550
interest rate derivatives. So what
should you, what should you do?

536
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,143
So

537
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,150
what should you do? Now you can
trade the mortgage, you can buy it,

538
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,260
you can sell it short,

539
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,310
you can a buy or sell these
interest rate derivatives.

540
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,630
What would you do?

541
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:02,770
Let's say you can only buy or sell
one unit in the mortgage. There's,

542
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:06,520
there's only one mortgage that you
know is training and you want to,

543
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,250
since you know there's a mistake
being made, you're going to,

544
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:12,130
you're going to use all of it.
So what would you do?

545
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,543
Okay.

546
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:21,210
Do you think the mortgage is
overvalued or undervalued? Overvalued.

547
00:34:21,211 --> 00:34:25,740
So therefore, what should you do?
Sell all you're allowed to sell.

548
00:34:25,741 --> 00:34:28,140
I've assumed you know,
a little artificially.

549
00:34:28,141 --> 00:34:30,570
All you can do is sell one
unit of the Morgan Short.

550
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,180
So you're going to sell it for $120

551
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:39,080
okay?
But what does it mean to sell it short?

552
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:43,760
It means you have to make the payments
that the mortgage is making. Okay,

553
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:48,230
so you and all those payments are
only worth $98 so what does that mean?

554
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:53,180
It means that you know you're going
to get a profit of $22 okay? However,

555
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:58,270
you could get completely crushed if
things don't turn out exactly the way you

556
00:34:58,341 --> 00:35:02,450
thought. So you want to lock
in a constant profit for sure.

557
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,460
So you don't want to get a huge profit
more than 20 and no profit in some other

558
00:35:07,461 --> 00:35:10,250
cases or even a negative
profit and a huge profit.

559
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:14,810
You want your $22 for sure. So how
would you do that? What would you do?

560
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:18,723
Yes.

561
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,253
Yeah.

562
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,870
Okay. So let's be more precise.
It's exactly right. Well,

563
00:35:28,871 --> 00:35:31,840
let's just see what that really means.
Okay.

564
00:35:31,841 --> 00:35:35,200
So I'm going to copy these numbers down,
which I can't see yet.

565
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,210
Yeah.

566
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,590
Okay.
So you,

567
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,920
you have a mortgage that's 98 you know,

568
00:35:43,921 --> 00:35:46,740
it's worth 98 something 0.8

569
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,161
okay.

570
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:55,161
And it could go and the upstate to 92.6

571
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:02,630
or in the downstate and could go to 99.011

572
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:10,470
okay? Now on the other hand, the
market thinks that this mortgage

573
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,730
on the other hand,
this other instrument

574
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,480
you're selling at the same time,
something that's worth 120

575
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,540
you're selling it for 120 okay?
It doesn't even matter what the,

576
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,970
it doesn't matter what the mistake is,
the market makes.

577
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,370
That's the reason why the
market made its mistake.

578
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,980
You don't care why they made
their mistake, you know,

579
00:36:36,981 --> 00:36:41,060
they're just willing to give you 124 it.
So you're making a $22 profit.

580
00:36:41,061 --> 00:36:42,140
So what should you do

581
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,900
if you are marketing yourself to market,
what would you do?

582
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,570
What would you mark
yourself to market here?

583
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:15,000
Well, you've gotten $122 so you've
marked yourself to market here.

584
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:20,001
You'd say you're 21 point $16 up here.

585
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:24,180
You'd have to say,
well, you know, you, uh,

586
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:28,350
you're not up so much money anymore
because you've just lost some of the value

587
00:37:28,351 --> 00:37:30,870
of your mortgage. You've
lost, you know, six bucks.

588
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:35,580
So you'd have to say you're only up $15
now and here you'd have to say, well,

589
00:37:35,581 --> 00:37:39,330
you made a little bit of money
so you're up, you know, $22 now,

590
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:41,961
hey,

591
00:37:41,961 --> 00:37:46,961
but you want to lock in this
Prophet 21 point 16 for sure.

592
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,290
So what should you do if you're
marking yourself to market,

593
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:53,450
you want to turn this money into,

594
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:58,930
you want to turn this into 21 point 16
but more than 21 to point 16 you want to

595
00:37:59,301 --> 00:38:04,301
turn this into 21 point 16 times one plus
r zero and you want to turn this into

596
00:38:06,531 --> 00:38:11,450
21 point 16 times one plus r zero okay?

597
00:38:11,451 --> 00:38:16,451
Because then having locked in 21 point
16 times one plus r zero that's no risk

598
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,190
and it's got the same
present value is this.

599
00:38:19,191 --> 00:38:24,191
And so every period you want to keep
locking your money into 21.16 that's the

600
00:38:24,501 --> 00:38:29,060
gap between that and up there. Maybe one
six wasn't the right number. By the way.

601
00:38:29,061 --> 00:38:31,520
What was this price appear
that they were willing to pay?

602
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:36,130
They are willing to pay 120.58
so that's a little bit more,

603
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:37,010
ah Ha.

604
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:42,010
That's 21 points seven or something.

605
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:44,950
So it's 21.7 that was the gap.

606
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:50,610
So it's 120.58 and so the
gap here is 21.7 so okay,

607
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:57,730
so you want to turn this
into 21.7 and this to 21.7

608
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,920
Hazel 21.7 here.
You know,

609
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,920
you want to ensure that that's what
you're marketing yourself to position.

610
00:39:03,921 --> 00:39:05,720
You want to know by the
end of the next year,

611
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,520
you could turn this into 21.7
you know, discount it up. Okay.

612
00:39:10,521 --> 00:39:13,010
And then keep a discount
until all the very end.

613
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,400
So whether you take your money now you're
taking your money late or it's always

614
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:20,990
a sure thing with exactly
the same present value. Okay.

615
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:25,130
So how would you turn 21.7 knowing that
you're going to run this risk if you're

616
00:39:25,131 --> 00:39:27,860
marking yourself to market,
how would you do that?

617
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:34,450
Well, you know the value of this plus
this at this interest rate with the in the

618
00:39:34,451 --> 00:39:39,280
mortgage derivative market,
it's worth 98.84 okay?

619
00:39:39,281 --> 00:39:44,281
So you can always transform this into
exactly 91.84 by doing a fair bet.

620
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:51,870
You can get this to go up to 91.84
and this to go down to 91 point uh

621
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,720
oh there's also a payment here.
Don't forget the payment. So sorry,

622
00:39:57,721 --> 00:39:58,750
we forgotten the payment.

623
00:39:58,751 --> 00:40:03,751
So this is the mortgage as much subtler
because you've actually gotten $8 here

624
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,330
plus eight and this is plus eight. Okay?
So we forgot about this, the president.

625
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:14,360
So you got an $8 coupon plus what was
left was 92.6 and this is 99.1 plus eight

626
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,670
it's actually the total,
yeah,

627
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:21,670
value here as a hundred 0.6 and
the total value here is 107.11

628
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,500
okay? And you discount
this by this, you know,

629
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:31,210
6% interest and you get 98.84 okay?
So,

630
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:34,420
so I left out a crucial step.
So remember the cash flows.

631
00:40:34,421 --> 00:40:37,390
Here are the coupon plus the
value of the mortgage that's left.

632
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,320
So the value of the mortgage
that's left is 92.65 okay?

633
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,830
Plus the $8 coupons.

634
00:40:43,831 --> 00:40:47,560
So over here you're going to have a
value of 100.6 down here you're going to

635
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:51,100
have a value of 107 point 11 okay?
So how can you,

636
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:55,350
you want that to equal locked in forever.
You want that too.

637
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:59,950
So you know that you've,
you've just sold this mortgage for um,

638
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,320
a hundred. Uh, what do you call it?

639
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:07,090
A hundred twenties you've
got $21.70 sitting here,

640
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,900
okay?
So now what can you do with this $21.70?

641
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:13,540
You can cancel your cash flows.

642
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:16,480
So what you owe on the mortgage
is always exactly the same thing.

643
00:41:16,481 --> 00:41:21,481
98.84 so you want to make this 98.84 so
you have to subtract off something from

644
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:27,460
here. A hundred 0.6 you have to subtract.
So you want this to be equal to,

645
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,630
so let's do it this way.
Okay,

646
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:34,070
let's make this 98 point.

647
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:39,380
There's a simpler way of
saying it. I think 98.84 okay,

648
00:41:39,381 --> 00:41:41,330
so let's turn this thing in.
This thing,

649
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:46,190
the present value of this and
this is 98.84 therefore, you know,

650
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:50,330
there must be some fair trade and the
derivatives market that turns this thing

651
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:55,360
and this thing and to 98.04 times one
plus r zero and this into the same thing,

652
00:41:55,731 --> 00:41:59,270
98.84 times one plus r zero how
do you know you can do that?

653
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:04,480
Because the present value of 98.84 times
one plus r zero and 98.84 times one

654
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:05,871
plus r zero,

655
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:10,871
a half of that plus a half of that
divided by one plus r zero is 98.84 so

656
00:42:11,691 --> 00:42:15,320
therefore the present value of this
thing has to be the same as the present

657
00:42:15,321 --> 00:42:16,640
value of that thing.

658
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,640
And therefore there must be some
trade in the derivatives market.

659
00:42:19,641 --> 00:42:21,590
You can make where you uh,

660
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:25,580
you sell some of these interest rate
derivatives and you buy some of these

661
00:42:25,581 --> 00:42:29,840
interest rate through it. It was, that
guarantees you 98.84 in both cases.

662
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,890
So that means the present value of what
you have to deliver in cat the present,

663
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:38,030
the value of what you'd have to
deliver in cash is 98.84 okay,

664
00:42:38,031 --> 00:42:43,031
still $21.70 in present value terms
less than what you've received.

665
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:44,331
Okay,

666
00:42:44,331 --> 00:42:48,230
so what have you done with this hundred
$20 you've invested that at the same

667
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:50,810
interest rate and so
now you've got a profit,

668
00:42:50,811 --> 00:42:55,100
you owe 98.84 jacked up
by the interest rate,

669
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,900
but the hundred 20 you've invested,

670
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,480
you've got that hundred 20
plus the interest rates,

671
00:42:59,481 --> 00:43:01,730
you've always got more
that you're carrying on.

672
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,970
Then the present value of what you owe
and you keep going to the end of the tree

673
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:05,804
when it ends,

674
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:10,820
you're going to still own 98.84 increased
by the interest rate a bunch of times.

675
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:15,590
But then the value of the money you
have is going to be 120 increased by the

676
00:43:15,591 --> 00:43:20,420
same interest rate. And so you're going
to end up, um, with money for sure,

677
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:23,990
which will have a con. So then you can
just reverse it all and get the money.

678
00:43:23,991 --> 00:43:28,850
21.7 locked in for sure at the beginning
and old, nothing later in the tree.

679
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,470
Okay? So to say it all
one more time, okay?

680
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:37,460
You have to think of yourself
as marking to market.

681
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:39,590
And if you're marking to market correctly,

682
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:44,740
you know what you owe is only worth $98
and what you've sold it for is $120.

683
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,900
That's a profit of 21.7.

684
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:52,850
But you want to make sure you can
maintain the same profit forever, okay?

685
00:43:52,851 --> 00:43:57,100
Or to put it another way,
if you've bought this bond and got those,

686
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:02,270
if you want to make sure you can
lock in your profit forever. Okay?

687
00:44:02,271 --> 00:44:05,930
So how would you do this? Well, um,

688
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:10,940
are different ways of doing it. I
was saying, suppose you, you, uh,

689
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,620
so let's say you want this $21.70 for
sure at the beginning and you don't want

690
00:44:15,621 --> 00:44:18,410
to ever have to make any payments on,
you know,

691
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,890
in the end you want everything
to cancel out. What would you do?

692
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,720
How would you do this? Well, this number
tells you you owe in present value terms,

693
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:29,240
$98.84.
Okay?

694
00:44:29,241 --> 00:44:33,030
So you've gotten a $20.
So with this,

695
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:37,650
you could take the hundred $20,
put 21.7 in your pocket,

696
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,270
and now with this $98,
you can buy,

697
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:46,740
uh, these cash flows. What
can you buy? You can invest,

698
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:51,150
you can invest money so that you,
um,

699
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,540
okay,

700
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:56,420
you can, you can buy the right
interest rate derivatives,

701
00:44:56,421 --> 00:45:00,140
so you're able to make all the
payments of the future bonds.

702
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:03,620
So this bond, the actual payments,
the bond is going to make,

703
00:45:03,621 --> 00:45:07,160
you can buy all those payments for $98.84.
Okay.

704
00:45:07,161 --> 00:45:09,170
I guess that's the
simplest way of saying it.

705
00:45:09,171 --> 00:45:11,270
I'm not saying going a
little bit in circles.

706
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,640
What is the mortgage security down here?

707
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,060
If you know how the mortgage
is going to pay, all this is,

708
00:45:17,061 --> 00:45:19,820
is a bunch of payments at
different parts in the tree, right?

709
00:45:19,821 --> 00:45:24,650
It pays $8 here at pays $8 here.
Somewhere low in the tree.

710
00:45:24,651 --> 00:45:28,550
It's gonna just prepay for sure and pay
the whole remaining balance. You know,

711
00:45:28,551 --> 00:45:33,530
down here it's not paying any, you
know, it's just paid off for sure. Okay,

712
00:45:33,531 --> 00:45:37,220
so it's prepaid. So
what is the, uh, sorry,

713
00:45:37,221 --> 00:45:41,540
it's prepaid at the top. It's just
going to at the bottom it's prepaid. So,

714
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:44,653
okay.

715
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:49,710
The fact that all these payments together
are worth 98.84 means that by taking

716
00:45:50,771 --> 00:45:54,730
$98.84 in trading on
the derivatives market,

717
00:45:54,731 --> 00:45:59,731
you can buy all those payments for exactly
98.84 so therefore as you go future

718
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:01,180
farther into the tree,

719
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,750
you always will have the payments
to make you sold the bond short.

720
00:46:04,751 --> 00:46:08,800
What does that mean? Anytime to this bond
makes the payment, the dividend payment,

721
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,780
you have to make the payment, but you
can always buy those payments for 98.84.

722
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,890
How do you know you can buy
those payments for 98.84? Well,

723
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,820
because you know,
by by backward induction here,

724
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:27,230
the payments are $8 here plus
$92 of remaining payments.

725
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,910
So there's a way in an interest rate
derivatives market of buying eight plus

726
00:46:31,911 --> 00:46:36,911
92.6 that's $100.60 here
and buying 107.1 $11 here.

727
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:41,240
So by spending this 98.84,

728
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,820
you can get by this many, uh,
interest rate to revolution.

729
00:46:45,821 --> 00:46:50,600
You get a hundred dollars of payments
here and $107 of payments here, you know,

730
00:46:50,601 --> 00:46:55,601
half of 100 plus half of 107 discounted
at 6% interest gives you 98.84.

731
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:57,591
Okay?

732
00:46:57,591 --> 00:47:02,591
So it's possible on the market to buy
$100 up here in $107 down here with this

733
00:47:02,991 --> 00:47:06,800
98.84. Now out of those hundred
dollars up here you've bought,

734
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:11,030
give eight of them to the guy
you sold the bond short too.

735
00:47:11,031 --> 00:47:13,040
That's the coupon payment down here.

736
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,210
Give eight of these dollars to the
same guy you sold the coupon short too.

737
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:22,510
Now that leaves you with
$92 up there and $99 there,

738
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,780
but this $92 is the present value of
what's going to happen next and what's

739
00:47:26,781 --> 00:47:31,690
going to happen next up here is that
you're going to owe $8 to the guy here and

740
00:47:31,691 --> 00:47:33,430
you're going to owe $8 to the guy here,

741
00:47:33,431 --> 00:47:38,431
but what's left and be worth $83 and $97
so therefore with this $92 you in fact

742
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:45,270
are able to buy this 90 to plus 105 here
because you know the present value of

743
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,000
92 that's [inaudible] 91 you know
almost 90 to plus 105 here is exactly 92

744
00:47:55,121 --> 00:47:56,290
that's how he got that number.

745
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:01,320
It's a half times this number and plus
the coupon plus a half times this number,

746
00:48:01,481 --> 00:48:04,900
plus the coupon discounted at the interest
rate corresponding to hear that is

747
00:48:04,901 --> 00:48:09,160
$92 so therefore by investing
here in the interest rate market,

748
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,620
you can buy that cashflow here,

749
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:16,450
the 84 plus eight $92 okay,
pay the guy that ate,

750
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,050
you'll still have $83 left and
what the cash you have over here,

751
00:48:20,051 --> 00:48:23,740
remember you bought exactly this much
cash, you've got this much cash left,

752
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:28,450
you can buy all the payments you need
to make here the $8 coupon plus you'll

753
00:48:28,451 --> 00:48:32,560
still have 97 left.
So all the way forward through the tree,

754
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:37,510
you could always afford to buy all the
cash payments of this bond so you can pay

755
00:48:37,511 --> 00:48:41,530
off the guy you sold it short to all
the coupon payments that this bond is

756
00:48:41,531 --> 00:48:46,480
making by having invested 98.84
at the beginning. And similarly,

757
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:50,010
you've got 120 by selling the bond shorts.

758
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:54,880
So you've made $21.70 and there's never
any more cash coming out of your pocket,

759
00:48:55,090 --> 00:49:00,090
your pocket to the 21.7 and you invest
in the 98.4 in the derivatives market

760
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:05,050
over and over changing your investment
and therefore reproducing all the cash

761
00:49:05,051 --> 00:49:08,530
flows that you have to make to the
guy for having sold it short. Okay,

762
00:49:08,531 --> 00:49:12,130
so do I need to say this yet?
I've been saying it for the wealth.

763
00:49:12,131 --> 00:49:16,630
Do How followable with that?
Not Very followable. All right.

764
00:49:16,631 --> 00:49:20,290
Sorry. I didn't do a good
job, so let's try again.

765
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,860
What is the essence of what's going on?

766
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:27,490
The essence of what's going on is
that gain by gain or month by month.

767
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:32,260
You can find someone else who will
always trade at fair odds with you. Okay?

768
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:34,510
Fair odds means in the
interest rate market,

769
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:37,390
they don't know these people
trading the interest rate market.

770
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:41,350
They don't understand prepayments.
Okay? It's not like the book he here,

771
00:49:41,351 --> 00:49:42,760
they don't understand prepayments.

772
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:45,940
They're not willing to bet with you
on what prepayments are going to be.

773
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:50,110
They're just going to bet with you on
what interest rate is going to turn up.

774
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:55,530
But you see the cashflows from the bond
depended on prepayments and dependent on

775
00:49:56,261 --> 00:49:59,950
the interest rate.
So you calculated what it was worth,

776
00:49:59,951 --> 00:50:04,570
98.84 because you knew what
prepayments to put in the future.

777
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:09,250
So if you're absolutely confident
on your prepayments, okay,

778
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,430
you're going to know what this
bond is going to do in the future.

779
00:50:12,431 --> 00:50:15,280
So remember what the prepayment,
you know, and so what is,

780
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:17,890
what are those prepayments?
It's you know, this stuff.

781
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:21,700
So down here where the ones
are the guys prepaid for sure.

782
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,440
So you'd have to deliver it to the market,

783
00:50:23,441 --> 00:50:26,860
the entire remaining balance at that
point. But see when you, when you,

784
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,910
when you calculated this bond,

785
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,850
you are anticipating what all
the payments were going to be,

786
00:50:31,851 --> 00:50:34,670
whether they are going to be the whole
remaining balance or just the coupon

787
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:39,650
taking the present value.
What calculations were you
doing in the present value?

788
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,950
You're doing calculations
that this guy can do.

789
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:47,300
You're just taking a half times this
plus a half times that discounted the

790
00:50:47,301 --> 00:50:49,550
interest rate derivative.
Guys willing to do that.

791
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,500
He doesn't know what the
prepayments are going to be,

792
00:50:51,501 --> 00:50:53,720
but you're never betting
on prepayments with him.

793
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:56,090
With the interest rate derivatives guy,
you're just saying,

794
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:00,440
let me pay you some money now you give
me money if things go up here or I'll pay

795
00:51:00,441 --> 00:51:03,560
you some money ma now and you give
me money if things go down here,

796
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:06,440
if interest rates go up here
or interest rates go down here.

797
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:11,770
So because the present value of the
mortgage cashflows evaluated according to

798
00:51:13,611 --> 00:51:18,611
the interest rate probabilities
and discounting is 98.84
that means that you can

799
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:24,950
successively trade on the interest rate
market and reproduce all the mortgage

800
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:27,890
payments, assuming you're right
about what they're going to be.

801
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,380
And therefore with $98.84 you
can replicate what the bond,

802
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:36,830
what the mortgage is going to pay and
therefore you make 21.7 for free because

803
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,300
you sold it for 120.

804
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:43,490
You only need 98.8 for that to reproduce
all the payments of the mortgage bond.

805
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:45,170
And how do you know that you can do that?

806
00:51:45,171 --> 00:51:47,600
Because it's just one step
repeated over and over again.

807
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:52,780
At every step there's going to be a
payment of say $8 and a present value of

808
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:57,140
what's left. And there'll be a payment
down here of $8 in a present value.

809
00:51:57,141 --> 00:52:00,370
What the floods left.
Or maybe this thing is just uh,

810
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:05,080
a prepayment which case it's a
single payment of 90, you know,

811
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:09,230
99.5 that's the remaining
balance after one period. So,

812
00:52:09,231 --> 00:52:10,700
but when you figure out this number,

813
00:52:10,701 --> 00:52:15,230
it's always taken by averaging this
number discounted with this number

814
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,990
discounted.
Okay,

815
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:21,590
so therefore averaging at the,
at the odds,

816
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,340
the interest rate guy who will give you,
so therefore using this money,

817
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:28,310
we're now doing the opposite of
the world series using this money.

818
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:30,380
You can buy this cash,

819
00:52:30,381 --> 00:52:34,070
paint this total payment and you can
buy this total payment because that's

820
00:52:34,071 --> 00:52:35,330
exactly what the interest rate guy.

821
00:52:35,331 --> 00:52:40,331
We'll give you this as equal to a half
of all of that divided by one plus r zero

822
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,990
plus a half of all this divided by
one plus r zero that is this number.

823
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,570
So therefore the interest rate
market by using this cash,

824
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:52,310
you can buy that and you can buy that
and that's enough to make the payment a

825
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:56,450
eight that the mortgage is paying. So
you keep your promise. And over here,

826
00:52:56,451 --> 00:52:59,120
if the mortgage prepaid,
you know the remaining balance,

827
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:03,140
that's that number 99.5 you
can pay that too. And He,

828
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:05,840
and then the mortgage is done here.
The mortgage is going to go on.

829
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:08,140
But see it's going on at present value.

830
00:53:08,141 --> 00:53:13,141
You've calculated at 92.6 you bought
92.6 plus eight use the eight to pay off

831
00:53:14,421 --> 00:53:18,440
the coupon.
You still have $92.60 in your pocket here.

832
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:22,000
You're going to use that to buy
the future payments of a mortgage,

833
00:53:22,001 --> 00:53:26,130
some of which will be a coupon and
maybe this will be another coupon. Okay.

834
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:29,070
Plus the present value of what's left.
If it goes down to here,

835
00:53:29,071 --> 00:53:32,220
again the guy might prepay but you're
going to have enough money left to make

836
00:53:32,221 --> 00:53:33,060
that prepayment.

837
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:37,650
So with this $98.84 you just doing
fair rods over and over again,

838
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:42,830
you're buying the future cash flows and
the mortgage and therefore with $98.84

839
00:53:42,901 --> 00:53:46,800
you can keep all your promises and yet
you've gotten 120 at the beginning so

840
00:53:46,801 --> 00:53:51,300
you've locked it in. Hey,
so that's the, that's it.

841
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:56,550
Any questions? I don't know if that was
to clear. So somebody asks a question,

842
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:01,250
you are great at asking questions
cause there is this followup will or,

843
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:06,600
okay, well that's, it
was too good to great.

844
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:12,810
Okay.
So let's see if I can do another example.

845
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:17,000
Um,
uh,

846
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:24,720
okay,
let's suppose that we've got this bond.

847
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:30,530
Let's say you can't trade in the interest
rate derivatives market directly,

848
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:37,170
but you can trade in the bond market.

849
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:42,720
So let's get more realistic. Now. Let's
suppose that there's a bond market.

850
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:48,530
Now here we had interest rates of Ah

851
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:57,560
yeah, we had, okay, so
as a 30 year bond, 8%,

852
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:01,730
the starting interest rate was six and
the volatility was 20. So we had that,

853
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,610
that a sheet that was bond market trading.

854
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:08,810
So let's just go to that file was open.

855
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:14,430
Okay,
so callable bond.

856
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:20,710
So here we are in the bond market.
So let's say there's a 9% coupon bond.

857
00:55:20,711 --> 00:55:22,660
Doesn't matter what it is.
Uh,

858
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:26,590
we start at the interest rate of 0.06,

859
00:55:26,591 --> 00:55:29,940
was that where we were starting
and the volatility was 20.

860
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:35,670
Okay, so here we have the same exact, um,

861
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,910
you've got exactly the same
interest rate processes before.

862
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,430
So those are the interest
rates just as we had before.

863
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:48,750
Okay. And now let's talk about a
bond. So it's a non callable bond.

864
00:55:48,751 --> 00:55:52,920
I forgot already. Now what I said
how, how long was this bond? It was a,

865
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:57,030
it was a 30 year bond,
didn't have to be 30 years,

866
00:55:57,031 --> 00:55:59,430
but it was a 30 year,
9% bond

867
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:08,720
and its value was 140.93 so the bond is
worth 140.93 the interest rates go up,

868
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:18,090
same interest rate process.
It can go to 121.4

869
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:23,740
or two 159.4

870
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:27,893
okay.

871
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:32,450
So now let's suppose you can't
trade and the interest rate

872
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:34,970
market anymore.

873
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:40,470
What should you do now?

874
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:52,130
Well you've got the interest rate,
you've got the one month bond,

875
00:56:52,131 --> 00:56:57,131
but you can trade at an interest rate
of a 6% and you've got this bond market.

876
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:01,730
So anyone will buy and sell
with you. This, this is the,

877
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,360
remember this is the 30 year,
30 year,

878
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,580
9% coupon bond.

879
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:10,880
They're all willing to buy
and sell this with you.

880
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:15,980
And you've got this mortgage
that everybody else thinks
is the price is worth

881
00:57:15,981 --> 00:57:20,280
120 but you're sure it's worth
98.84 cause you know the,

882
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,470
the prepayments,

883
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:26,580
the homeowners are smart and they're
going to prepay and no one else realizes

884
00:57:26,581 --> 00:57:28,610
that they're going to do it.
So what should you do now?

885
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:32,060
You can't trade interest
rate derivatives anymore.

886
00:57:32,061 --> 00:57:34,070
All you can do is trade
in the bond market.

887
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:36,980
So you do you have any
idea what you could do?

888
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:44,790
What would you do? So this is um, this
is even slightly more realistic example.

889
00:57:44,791 --> 00:57:48,510
You've got a mortgage that
you know is overvalued.

890
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,950
You've got a bond that you can trade.

891
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:56,420
And of course you can trade a very
short bond. The one one year bond,

892
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:58,250
which is trading at 6% interest.

893
00:57:58,251 --> 00:58:02,900
You can trade a one year treasury
and here's the 30 year 9% treasury.

894
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:08,240
Okay? Which happens to be worth 140. So
what should you do? Well, you know that,

895
00:58:08,241 --> 00:58:10,400
you know,
you could sell this mortgage short,

896
00:58:10,401 --> 00:58:15,401
get $120 for it and you think the value
of the payments is only 98 so you'd love

897
00:58:15,981 --> 00:58:18,080
to do this. The trouble is it, you know,

898
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:22,910
the future values depend on a
lot of uncertainty. Okay? So,

899
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:27,090
um, it may be that you'd
have to, you know, you pay,

900
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:31,040
the payments you might have to make are
more than 98. They could go. So, you know,

901
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,300
so what are you going to do?

902
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,860
How would you lock in your profit?
For sure.

903
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,420
Can anybody figure out what to do?
Just intuitively,

904
00:58:43,421 --> 00:58:46,810
it seems like pretty complicated
to figure out what to do.

905
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,570
So you sell this bond for 120,

906
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:55,330
you put the $21.70 in your pocket,

907
00:58:55,540 --> 00:59:00,540
you have $98.40 now that you have to
spend to somehow acquire payments that are

908
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:05,260
going to just allow you
to make the bond payments.

909
00:59:05,261 --> 00:59:08,830
You've sold short the mortgage
payments you sold short and every node,

910
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:12,190
so you never have to give up any
more money. So what should you do?

911
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:19,180
You want to acquire some assets with
this $98.84 that'll put you in a position

912
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:24,700
where you have a hundred point dollars
up here and $100.71 down there.

913
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:30,040
So how can you do that?
Well,

914
00:59:30,041 --> 00:59:33,370
you have a combination of the short,
you can put,

915
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:38,220
you have this 30 year bond you
could invest in if you bought,

916
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:41,500
if you spent $98 on the 30 year bond,

917
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:44,350
you know that's 70% of that.

918
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:48,370
So that would give you 84 up
here and 105 down there. Okay,

919
00:59:48,371 --> 00:59:51,430
so wouldn't match what you really need.
On the other hand,

920
00:59:51,431 --> 00:59:54,940
you could also put your
$98 and the one year bond,

921
00:59:54,941 --> 00:59:58,300
which would give you 98.84 times,
you know,

922
00:59:58,301 --> 01:00:03,301
1.06 and 98.04 times 1.06 so you've
got this choice or are you can put,

923
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:09,880
you know,
you can put $100 here and get $106 there.

924
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:12,940
Right?
That's what the one year,

925
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:17,560
the interest rate we said was 6% so that
means there's a one year bond that pays

926
01:00:17,561 --> 01:00:21,160
106 in these two cases,
there's the 30 year bond.

927
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:25,600
We're $140 could be worth this
and this in the two cases.

928
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:31,870
So let's say you can't go trade
on the derivatives market.

929
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:35,350
It doesn't exist but release,
you don't know how to trade on it.

930
01:00:35,351 --> 01:00:39,220
But when you do know how to trade is
on the bond market and the, you know,

931
01:00:39,221 --> 01:00:41,560
the long bond market and
the short bond mark get.

932
01:00:41,561 --> 01:00:45,960
So let's call this the long bond
market and the short bond market.

933
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:56,830
So what would you do?

934
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,073
Okay.

935
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:17,020
Any thoughts here?

936
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:22,390
So let me repeat the problem you find
like you typically do when you were

937
01:01:22,391 --> 01:01:24,430
trained or you know something
other guys don't do.

938
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:26,170
That's what you're making
your whole livelihood on.

939
01:01:26,171 --> 01:01:30,340
You understand the prepayments are
going to be very fast. They're going to,

940
01:01:30,341 --> 01:01:33,550
you know, the people know how to
prepay the rest of the market.

941
01:01:33,551 --> 01:01:37,600
It hasn't occurred to them yet that
people can prepay there over grossly

942
01:01:37,601 --> 01:01:38,920
overpaying for the mortgage.

943
01:01:38,921 --> 01:01:42,670
Paying $120 so you go and
sell the mortgage short.

944
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,430
Now that means you have to
deliver whatever anyone else,

945
01:01:45,431 --> 01:01:49,150
what the mortgage is pain, you have
to deliver it to other people. Okay,

946
01:01:49,151 --> 01:01:50,620
so that's a lot to take on.

947
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:55,860
But I say that you can sell this
bond for 120 put 21.7 in your pocket,

948
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:03,030
take the remaining $98.84 and now by the
cash flows that you're going to have to

949
01:02:03,731 --> 01:02:06,980
deliver in the future, how do you
know you can buy all the cash flows,

950
01:02:06,981 --> 01:02:10,960
their 30 years of cash flows, their
coupon payments, they're prepayments.

951
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:14,020
There are all kinds of complicated
payments. So the cash flows,

952
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:18,130
how would those $98.94 you're going
to be able to buy them all. Exactly.

953
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:23,370
All you can do is trade by the long bond
and by the short bond or maybe sell the

954
01:02:23,641 --> 01:02:26,160
long bond short or sell
the short bond short.

955
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:29,430
So how by trading these two securities,

956
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:34,730
can you over and over again can you
replicate the cash flows of the mortgage?

957
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:40,500
That way you will have hedged out your
risk and you'll have the 21.7 locked in

958
01:02:40,501 --> 01:02:43,530
with ml ever having to worry
about anything in the future.

959
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:47,850
Provided your prepayment
calculations are correct. You know,

960
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:50,600
if you're wrong about prepayments then
you're going to be in big trouble.

961
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:54,750
So you're betting on knowing what the
prepayments are. So what should you do?

962
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,200
Well here, this thing
is going to, you know,

963
01:02:58,410 --> 01:03:03,410
the cash flows at this point are gonna
be worth a hundred 0.68 that you have to

964
01:03:03,841 --> 01:03:08,390
deliver 92.6 for the present value
of the future cash flows here.

965
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,410
They're worth
here or they're worth,

966
01:03:12,411 --> 01:03:14,780
let's just do the real thing.
Nevermind that stuff.

967
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:18,650
Here are the worth 107 point 11 okay?

968
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:23,680
Now you know that a half times a half
times one over one plus r zero of 106 plus

969
01:03:25,761 --> 01:03:30,761
a half over one plus 0.06 times 107 is
98.84 so the average of these discount it

970
01:03:33,831 --> 01:03:36,710
is that number. Okay. So,

971
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:41,990
and you know that the
average of these numbers, um,

972
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,800
so this is the non callable bonds,
so it's not these numbers,

973
01:03:45,801 --> 01:03:50,510
it's this number plus nine and this
number plus nine is paid a coupon.

974
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:55,280
So the average of these numbers
discounted by 6% is that?

975
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:00,173
Yeah.

976
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:05,190
Okay, so, so what does that
tell you should you should do?

977
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:13,040
Well I cleaned by combining
this bond and this bond,

978
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:17,440
you can produce a hundred 0.6
and 107 point 11 here. So,

979
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:22,450
so we know that this top bond is going
to pay you 138.4 up there and 168.4 down

980
01:04:27,261 --> 01:04:31,720
here. Hey, so if you bought, you know,

981
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:35,240
x units of the long bond,
that's what your pay offs would be.

982
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:40,260
The short bond is going to pay you 106
in both cases. So if you bought x units,

983
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:43,100
so the short bond,
that's what your payoff would be.

984
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:45,650
And you want the payoff to be,

985
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:51,130
you want the payoff to be a
hundred 0.6 and 107 point 11

986
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:03,000
hey, so there must be an XL
and an excess that equals that.

987
01:05:03,001 --> 01:05:04,350
How do you know there has to be,

988
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:09,270
because it's two equations in two unknowns
and these are independent equations.

989
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:09,931
In fact,

990
01:05:09,931 --> 01:05:14,931
you can tell what Xcel has to be this
gap between a 100.6 no and the hundred

991
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:21,200
seven that gap is about seven
and this gap is about 38 okay,

992
01:05:22,871 --> 01:05:27,871
so seven is like a fifth of 38 so
Xcel is going to have to be a fifth.

993
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:35,270
So I know in advance that this is going
to turn out to be about seven over 38

994
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,450
okay.
And XSL just by general principles,

995
01:05:39,451 --> 01:05:44,430
you know there's a solution for
Xcel and access. Okay? Now, okay,

996
01:05:44,431 --> 01:05:47,100
so I know there's a solution to that
because it's too old linear equations in

997
01:05:47,101 --> 01:05:48,690
two unknowns and they're not degenerate.

998
01:05:48,691 --> 01:05:51,360
So I know there has to be
a solution to that. Okay.

999
01:05:51,361 --> 01:05:54,330
And I also can tell you what
Xcel has to be because the gap,

1000
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,480
that's a difference between the top
number and the bottom number is seven.

1001
01:05:57,690 --> 01:06:02,690
That gap over there is 38 so obviously
the middle gap 160 160 zero so if I take

1002
01:06:04,801 --> 01:06:07,560
Xcel to be seven 38th of that number,

1003
01:06:07,561 --> 01:06:11,340
the gap is going to go down from 38 to
seven and then I'll just have to find the

1004
01:06:11,341 --> 01:06:13,800
right access to make that equal.
Okay,

1005
01:06:13,801 --> 01:06:16,460
so that combination of XL and excess,

1006
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:20,060
we'll produce this payoff
here in this payoff there.

1007
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:26,250
Okay, so I know what combination of the
long bond and the short bond to hole.

1008
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:30,840
So I produced exactly these things.
So I'm going to get a cash flow of a,

1009
01:06:30,841 --> 01:06:31,141
you know,

1010
01:06:31,141 --> 01:06:35,730
a hundred 0.6 and 107 point 11 and I'll
be able to use that to make the coupon

1011
01:06:35,731 --> 01:06:40,410
payment of eight and both cases and on
top of that have enough money to continue

1012
01:06:40,411 --> 01:06:43,020
buying future cash flows.
Okay.

1013
01:06:43,021 --> 01:06:47,830
Now what will the cost of
this l an x a short be?

1014
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:49,390
It'll be XL.

1015
01:06:49,391 --> 01:06:53,900
I'll have to pay $100 for
the x for the short bond.

1016
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:56,060
If I do x, x, x, Short,

1017
01:06:56,061 --> 01:07:00,140
and I'll have to take seven 30 days of
140 that's almost, it'll cost me to be,

1018
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:04,760
to buy the long bond. So the right
combination of short bond and long bond,

1019
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:09,320
short pond and long bond will give
me the right right payoffs. And now,

1020
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:13,790
uh, and it's clear that there
is an excess here. Okay.

1021
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:17,860
And an XL here such
that I get the payoffs,

1022
01:07:17,870 --> 01:07:22,870
I won 100 and 107 but the last thing to
notice is the cost of this XL and this x

1023
01:07:23,901 --> 01:07:25,670
s okay.

1024
01:07:25,671 --> 01:07:30,590
Which is going to be 140 times
XL plus a hundred times excess.

1025
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:33,770
That cost will be exactly 98.84

1026
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:42,750
okay, how do I know that? And therefore
I'll just be able to do it. Okay,

1027
01:07:42,751 --> 01:07:45,990
so I'll ask you that question the second.
So here's,

1028
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:50,520
here's what this hedging amounts to the
hedging amounts to. Again, you know,

1029
01:07:50,521 --> 01:07:54,780
because of your superior knowledge of
prepayments, but the mortgage cash flows,

1030
01:07:54,781 --> 01:07:55,710
not the mortgage itself,

1031
01:07:55,711 --> 01:08:00,510
the cash flows that are going to come
from the mortgage could only worth 98.8

1032
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:05,660
someone's handing you $120 in exchange
for making those mortgage cash flows.

1033
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:07,770
Okay,
so what do you do for that?

1034
01:08:07,771 --> 01:08:12,771
You take the $98.84 out of the hundred
20 you take 21.7 that goes into your

1035
01:08:13,021 --> 01:08:17,870
pocket, the 98.4 you have to use
to buy the future cash flows. Well,

1036
01:08:17,871 --> 01:08:18,081
you know,

1037
01:08:18,081 --> 01:08:21,830
the first cash flows are going to be $8
but you're gonna need more money to buy

1038
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:25,010
the cashflows that come after.
How much more money do you need?

1039
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:28,820
92.6 here at 99.1 there.
Okay,

1040
01:08:28,821 --> 01:08:33,530
so how can you put yourself in a
position to have a hundred $0.60 here and

1041
01:08:33,531 --> 01:08:35,780
$107.11 here?

1042
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:39,800
Can you use this amount
of money to buy these,

1043
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:44,390
this value at the next step? Well we saw
in the derivatives market, yes you can,

1044
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:47,750
but even if you can't trade in the
derivatives market, you don't need to,

1045
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:50,120
if you could trade a
short bond and along bond,

1046
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:54,140
you would just find how much of the
long bond do I hold and how much of the

1047
01:08:54,141 --> 01:08:59,141
short bond do I hold so I can get these
cash flows of 100.6 and 107.11 and the

1048
01:09:00,291 --> 01:09:03,320
answer is you have to solve
that equation up there,

1049
01:09:03,321 --> 01:09:07,100
what Xcel and one excess
gives you that number. Okay.

1050
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:08,750
And that is a,

1051
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:12,860
you know that there's some excel and
some access that will solve that because

1052
01:09:12,861 --> 01:09:15,650
it's two equations in two unknowns.
I'm repeating myself.

1053
01:09:15,890 --> 01:09:20,780
You even know what Xcel is without
writing down the equations because the gap

1054
01:09:20,781 --> 01:09:23,780
has to be, you know, one thing,
there's no risk. And the other thing,

1055
01:09:23,781 --> 01:09:24,650
there's a big risk.

1056
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:29,000
So the only risk in the payoff
has to come from the long bond.

1057
01:09:29,001 --> 01:09:32,240
So that gap of 38 if you
take seven 30 ace of that,

1058
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,340
you're going to get the
gap to go down to seven.

1059
01:09:34,341 --> 01:09:38,540
So the XL is gonna turn out to be seven
30 ays excess you have to solve by

1060
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:43,010
Algebra. So you know how much that
Xcel is and what the excess is.

1061
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:47,180
Okay? So that's what you hold.
That combination of XL and excess,

1062
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:49,910
you hold here and you
get exactly the payoffs.

1063
01:09:49,911 --> 01:09:54,911
And then the final step is to notice that
you can exactly afford it with $98.84

1064
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:58,070
how do you know that you can afford it?

1065
01:09:58,310 --> 01:10:03,310
Because what you want is a 100.6 and
107 point 11 and that costs 98.84 okay?

1066
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:10,070
What you're buying,
you're buying two things together,

1067
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:15,460
which are w who's payoffs together are
worth 98.84 so therefore the cost of the

1068
01:10:18,261 --> 01:10:22,490
two things separately have
to be worth 98.84 okay?

1069
01:10:22,491 --> 01:10:25,640
So it will turn out when you
fought solve for Xcel and access,

1070
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:29,870
you'll exactly be able to afford
it with this amount of cash. Okay?

1071
01:10:29,871 --> 01:10:32,780
And so you can just do that
going forward all the time.

1072
01:10:32,781 --> 01:10:35,630
Constantly we hedging your portfolio.

1073
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:40,050
So that's the essence of dynamic hedging.
It's a very um,

1074
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:44,630
beautiful idea, which I probably
haven't explained in the optimal way.

1075
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:49,790
But the point is that, um, to
summarize the whole thing again,

1076
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:52,790
the point is that you take,
you know,

1077
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:57,791
something about a bond but you're subject
to more risk besides what you know,

1078
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:05,660
you hedge out the extra risk,
still relying on yourself
to be right about what,

1079
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:08,660
you know, you relied on your
being right about the prepayments.

1080
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:11,150
You don't know anything about
the future interest rates.

1081
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:14,070
But there's another guy like
the trader in the world series,

1082
01:11:14,071 --> 01:11:17,310
the broker in the world series who's
willing to make bets on the interest rate

1083
01:11:17,311 --> 01:11:20,760
with you. Okay. Or to say
the same thing. Who's,

1084
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:24,860
who's been calculating the values
of the bonds as if you know,

1085
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:28,980
the short and the long bond as if he
was making bets on the interest rate

1086
01:11:28,981 --> 01:11:33,900
because he's calculated at the same 50,
50 odds discounting by the interest rate.

1087
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,830
So because there all these guys in the
market who are willing to make these game

1088
01:11:37,831 --> 01:11:39,960
by game bets either directly,

1089
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:43,740
I'm almost done there either to make the
game by game bets and the interest rate

1090
01:11:43,741 --> 01:11:47,130
directly in the derivatives market
or what's equivalent to that.

1091
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:52,200
They've used that calculus to figure out
the value of these long and short bonds.

1092
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,390
So by trading to the long and short bonds,

1093
01:11:54,391 --> 01:11:58,260
you're effectively doing the same
interest rate bet. So either way,

1094
01:11:58,261 --> 01:12:01,200
by trading through the two bonds are
trading directly in the interest rate

1095
01:12:01,201 --> 01:12:02,070
derivative market,

1096
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:06,540
you're able to buy by going
game at a time, year by year,

1097
01:12:06,541 --> 01:12:09,840
you're able to buy all the
cashflows of your mortgage,

1098
01:12:09,841 --> 01:12:12,090
the cash flows that you're
predicting it's going to have,

1099
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:16,410
and therefore you can make the
profit for sure. Okay. So just it's,

1100
01:12:16,411 --> 01:12:18,300
it's a predicting something,

1101
01:12:18,301 --> 01:12:22,380
being confident in your prediction than
being able to buy what you've predicted.

1102
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:26,310
The cash flows are for a smaller price,
then you can sell the security for,

1103
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,980
that's how you locked in your profit.
Okay.
