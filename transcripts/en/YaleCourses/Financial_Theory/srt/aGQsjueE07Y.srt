1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,550
Okay. But now I want to
move to the next topic. Um,

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,770
which is the topic called the
capital asset pricing model.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,120
And it's in some points,
the high point of the class.

4
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:15,330
It's used to be the high
point of a finance. Uh,

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,250
the theory hasn't worked out as well
as people thought, uh, in recent times,

6
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:25,251
but it is quite a great achievement
and a lot of it was done here at Yale.

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,850
So I want to ex explain it to you.
So you see we have a problem so far.

8
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:31,800
If everybody's trying to hedge,

9
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:36,300
that means everybody's trying to get a
completely, you know, riskless payoff.

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,370
It's impossible because I mean,

11
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:42,510
there's real risk in the economy in s
and so how and what do we mean by real

12
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:43,620
risk?
Well,

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,850
something in one state is just going to
be bad for the whole economy compared to

14
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:50,580
another state. Maybe we'll run
out of oil or something like that.

15
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,200
It's impossible that everybody can
consume the same thing in every state.

16
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,260
So it's impossible that
everybody can perfectly hedge,

17
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,700
but everybody wants to perfectly hedge.
So what has to happen? What gives?

18
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:05,670
How does the theory have to change?
Well,

19
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,300
the theory is going to
change in a simple way,

20
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:12,930
which Shakespeare himself already
knew and already told us about.

21
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:14,010
And the merchant of Venice,

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,840
what's going to happen is everybody is
going to try and hedge as must as they

23
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:20,700
can by diversifying.

24
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,110
But because there's some real risk
in the economy, in some states,

25
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,320
things will be, uh, in the aggregate,

26
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,560
worse than they will be in other states.

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,380
So what's the consequence of that?

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,640
The consequence of that is if you're
going to buy an asset that pays something

29
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:42,990
that's riskless, you're going to pay the
discounted expected return of the acid.

30
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,480
But if you're going to
buy an asset that's risky,

31
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,820
you're going to need a
higher rate of return.

32
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:51,750
So the price will be less than
the expected discounted payoff.

33
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,200
So Shakespeare member said
exactly that. When the, uh,

34
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,880
the play begins with Antonio, uh,
looking melancholy, melancholy,

35
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,320
uh, his entire interlocutor says
Solario or somebody asks them,

36
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:07,140
it's whether he's worried about
his businesses. He says, no,

37
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:11,670
I've got a different ship. Every ships
on a different ocean. So I'm diversified.

38
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,990
I'm not that worried.

39
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,530
So Shakespeare knows about diversification
and that's what everybody should do.

40
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,150
But then when it comes time to pick the
caskets to get to marry the beautiful

41
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:24,180
Porsche, who by the way is not
just beautiful, but she's rich.

42
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:28,110
So they're looking for a prize,
the the uh,

43
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,490
but they sign a contract that whoever
picks the wrong casket not only doesn't

44
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:35,640
get Porsche,
he can never marry anyone in the future.

45
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,840
So what's the purpose of that contract?
It's to make it a very risky gamble.

46
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,170
And so why did Shakespeare want to make
it a risky gamble? So we can explain?

47
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:44,650
He understands risk and return.

48
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:46,920
So you remember the conversation
where everybody says, well,

49
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:48,840
I'm not going to pick
this unless you know,

50
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:51,750
it's only because she's so rich and so
beautiful that I'm willing to do this.

51
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:54,690
The return is so high that
it's worth the risk to me.

52
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,380
So Shakespeare already understood that
things that are risky are going to have

53
00:02:58,381 --> 00:03:02,880
to be priced less than their
expected return. So expected payoffs,

54
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:04,210
so they expected return.

55
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:08,500
That is the payoff per dollar put into
it looks higher to compensate you for the

56
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:12,730
rest. So Shakespeare almost had the whole
story. What's missing from Shakespeare?

57
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,290
Well, what is the definition of
risk is missing from Shakespeare?

58
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,810
And it will turn out that it's going
to be a very surprising definition.

59
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,810
So the purpose of the model I'm going to
explain is how do you measure risk and

60
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:30,340
how should that affect the price of
things and how does that affect all the

61
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:32,920
analysis we've done so far?
Okay,

62
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,110
so that's the topic of the
next couple of lectures.

63
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,410
So the first person to confront
this problem and propose a solution,

64
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,540
a mathematical solution was the
mathematician Bernoulli and his brother.

65
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,650
So the Bernoulli's were famous
mathematical family. Uh,

66
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,820
and one of the brothers went off to
St Petersburg where he ended up dying

67
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,820
shortly afterwards, but
he invented, uh, he,

68
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:03,040
he noticed the following puzzle. Suppose
I am, some of you have heard this.

69
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:08,041
It's called the Saint Petersburg
paired Pete Saint Petersburg paradox.

70
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,850
So suppose I offer you a bet. I
say, ah, I'm going to flip a coin.

71
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,130
And it keeps flipping the
coin until it comes up. Tails.

72
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,690
And I count how many coin flips I've had.

73
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,630
I've counted until you get tails.
And if that's end flips,

74
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,190
you get two to the n dollars.

75
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,790
So if you flip it one time and
it comes up tails right away,

76
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,490
which is probability a half,
you get $2.

77
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,540
If I flip it two times and it
gets heads and then tails, okay?

78
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:45,010
That's with probability a quarter you get,
you flipped it twice,

79
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:47,800
you get to to the two or $4.

80
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,280
If I flip it three times and
I get heads, heads, tails,

81
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:54,580
the odds of that are half times a,
half times a half, which is an eighth.

82
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,490
But then you'll get two to the $3.
Okay?

83
00:04:57,491 --> 00:05:01,440
So four plus eight plus,
you know,

84
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,530
one over two to the end times
two to the n plus dot, dot, dot.

85
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,790
So Bernoulli the one
who died, um, you know,

86
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,380
told his brother Daniel about
this and he said, well, you know,

87
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:17,140
I've offered this bet to a bunch
of people and I asked them,

88
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,930
how much would they be
willing to pay for this?

89
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:24,880
Risky acid and I mean,
what would you pay?

90
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:25,900
What's,
here's the numbers,

91
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:29,290
how many dollars would you
pay if I offered you this bed?

92
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,480
I'm going to just keep fit.
Whipping a flare. Fair coin.

93
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:36,070
Count the number of flips until a tails
and pay you to, to the end dollars.

94
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,970
So this is the expectation,
which obviously equals infinity.

95
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,460
So according to what we said so far,

96
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:44,740
you should pay infinite
amount of dollars for it,

97
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,590
but Bernoulli couldn't get anyone
to offer him that much money.

98
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,340
How much would you offer for this bag?
I just want to hear some numbers.

99
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,160
Dollar 50 okay.
Anybody else have any

100
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,930
it's pretty conservative. I mean,
that's almost ridiculous. In fact,

101
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:08,230
you're guaranteed $2 no
matter what happens, right?

102
00:06:08,231 --> 00:06:10,840
So you're paying a dollar 50 and
you're going to get to for sure.

103
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:13,720
So that's a pretty
conservative number to say.

104
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,660
Anybody a little more
venturesome than that?

105
00:06:16,661 --> 00:06:20,800
You can't do worse than $2 in this bad.
What?

106
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,600
$4 $4. Okay. All right.

107
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:27,220
So Bernoulli asked a bunch of people,

108
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,000
and the average of what they
say happens to have been $4.

109
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,380
That's what they said on average. And so
burdened only said, well, this is amazing.

110
00:06:35,381 --> 00:06:38,980
The expectation is infinite and they're
only willing to pay me. I'm miserable.

111
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,020
$4 for this.
Now,

112
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,500
the real reason might have been that they
didn't believe Bernoulli was actually

113
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:46,270
going to pay the money. And uh, you know,

114
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,670
they give up their money and they
weren't going to get anything back.

115
00:06:48,671 --> 00:06:52,690
But let's ignore that temporarily
and take it seriously. Bertolli said,

116
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,930
the solution must be that people
don't care about the dollar payoff.

117
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,610
They care about the utility
of the dollar payoff.

118
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,680
So let's put in a utility function. So
the utility of the dollar payoff would be,

119
00:07:05,681 --> 00:07:08,320
you have to,
plus one porter,

120
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,130
you will four plus one eighth.

121
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,760
You have eight plus one
over two to the end.

122
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,570
You have two to the n plus. Dot, dot, dot.

123
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,580
And so then he said, well, of course,
why is that going to help? Well,

124
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:27,880
because if the utility
functions say looks like this,

125
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,020
so here's x and here's you a Vax,
the more dollars you get,

126
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,660
maybe it increases utility,
but by less and less.

127
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:39,490
So you're not really gaining much by
getting these numbers way out here.

128
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:41,080
They're not adding really much to utility.

129
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:44,080
So you only care about these
small numbers. I mean, you know,

130
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:48,130
it's good to have more, but not much
better to have more. So he said,

131
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,210
Lo and behold, if I put in log
natural as my utility function,

132
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:57,430
which this looks like that's
the graph of log natural. Okay.

133
00:07:57,431 --> 00:08:01,960
And I put this in
and now if you know a little bit of,

134
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,431
okay,

135
00:08:06,431 --> 00:08:11,431
now you see this is easy to solve to
compute because log of two to the end is n

136
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:15,640
times log of two. So the log of
two's come out and it's just,

137
00:08:15,641 --> 00:08:18,430
the psalm is log of two times the Psalm,

138
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,660
one over t times the sum of
one of her two to the end,

139
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:27,700
um, times. Uh, and so it's an over to,

140
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:29,090
to the end.
So it's the,

141
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:33,580
so this is equal to log of uh,

142
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,650
two times the song n equals one to
infinity and over two to the end.

143
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,560
Yeah, that's what it turns
out. That this thing is

144
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,383
that,

145
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:45,661
okay,

146
00:08:45,661 --> 00:08:48,740
so it's not just one over two to the n
which would have added up to one but an

147
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:52,260
over to, to the end. So the point is,
because you have the log function here,

148
00:08:52,261 --> 00:08:55,140
this actually equals a log of four.

149
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,720
So anyway, I've worked out the arithmetic,
it's very simple. You just have,

150
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,670
you all know how to some
one over two to the,

151
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:05,070
and you probably don't know how
to sum in over two to the end.

152
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,510
You never thought of doing it before,

153
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:09,510
but the same trick gets you to be
able to some and over two to the end.

154
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,750
It's obviously more than one or two to
the end. In fact, it's equal to two.

155
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,090
So this sum is equal to two and two times.
Log of two is log of two squared,

156
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:21,570
which is log of four. So
by plugging in, instead of,

157
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,910
instead of caring about the expectation,
you care about the expected utility,

158
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,020
you can explain why the average
person was willing to pay $4.

159
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,170
Because the expected log in this
is equal to the log of four.

160
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,390
This is equal to the log of four.

161
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,210
So Bernoulli thought he'd
brilliantly explained his paradox.

162
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:43,320
So this is the other brother,
Daniel and the dot.

163
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,100
The dead brother pose the problem and
maybe solve the two for all I know,

164
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:47,934
but the one who,

165
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:53,190
the other brother who still live came
up with the a solution maybe with his

166
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:58,370
brother that it's uh, you know,
people don't look at expected payoffs.

167
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,540
They looked at expected utility of payoffs
and the utility should have this con

168
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,560
k feature that more and more
payoff ads on the margin,

169
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:11,590
less and less utility. So the,
this is, so you know what,

170
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,970
there's this function satisfies
d squared util effects.

171
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,370
The x squared is less than zero.
Second derivative is negative. Okay?

172
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:23,070
So the margin utilities declining
as you get more and more.

173
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,460
So that was the first, um, the,

174
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:31,050
that was the first advance on how
to deal with risk. Now actually,

175
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:35,850
Bernoulli didn't really solve
the problem because, you know,

176
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,880
just saying that you replace utility with
the payoff with expected utility of a

177
00:10:40,991 --> 00:10:42,620
concave function,
you know,

178
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,440
this log wouldn't have really solved the
problem because suppose that Bernoulli

179
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:51,210
had offered instead a bet not have
to to the end. But if to, to the, to,

180
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:54,540
to the end, you know, much
more generous bet. Okay.

181
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:58,200
Then even with logs,
you would've gotten an infinite number.

182
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,980
So basically he should have
said that you maximize that.

183
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:06,981
People care about a concave function of
payoff where the function is bounded,

184
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,590
unlike log, which is
not bounded. But anyway,

185
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:14,820
let's leave that aside should
be a concave function. Okay,

186
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:18,870
so to put it another way,
a concave function has the property.

187
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,780
If you look at it, you know,
let's say it looks like that,

188
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,960
that if you have this path x a
and this path xb and you've got,

189
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:32,970
so this is the utility now
here x say,

190
00:11:32,971 --> 00:11:37,840
and this is the utility, you have x
Xb and this is the utility you have.

191
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,960
Say if you have a 50 50
bet of either getting x,

192
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:47,480
say are getting XP, you're going to
end up with this expected utility.

193
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:50,760
Are Utilities going to be half
of Uxa plus half of your XP?

194
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:51,840
That's what we had down here.

195
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,260
Half of this utility plus
half of of that utilities.

196
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,490
I mean nothing else can happen.
Okay,

197
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,230
but if you're giving the person
half the amounts of money, for sure.

198
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,253
Okay.

199
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:08,300
Then he gets this utility which
is much bigger than that utility.

200
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,450
Okay.
Because this is a kind k function.

201
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:17,580
The extra you gain by winning the bet
compared to getting the average for sure

202
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,570
the extra you game doesn't drive the
utility up very much cause it's flattening

203
00:12:21,571 --> 00:12:25,320
out. Whereas losing the bet, even though
you're losing the same number of dollars,

204
00:12:25,321 --> 00:12:27,480
because from here to here as
the same as from here to here,

205
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,500
the loss of the same number of dollars
is more important to you than the gain of

206
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:35,580
an equal amount of dollars. And that's
why you'd rather get the middle for sure,

207
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,760
than having a 50 50 chance
of going on the extremes.

208
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,970
So Bernoulli pointed the way to
the modern theory of risk aversion,

209
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,140
which is to just assume

210
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,700
risk aversion in modern economics means
people care about expected utility.

211
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,230
Okay.
Maybe discounted,

212
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:08,231
expected discounted utility expected
this county utility where the utility is

213
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:10,580
concave.

214
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:15,850
Yeah.

215
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,700
Okay. So whatever utility
function we wrote in here,

216
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,790
maybe it shouldn't be log
should be something else.

217
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,410
How would people evaluate this?
They'd evaluate it.

218
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:31,411
Log of four and other ones they'd say
take whatever that constant utility was,

219
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:36,620
which was log of four that
produces the same utilities,

220
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,470
the random gamble. So this random
gamble is this expected utility,

221
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:45,580
which is equivalent to having
that for sure. So here's the four.

222
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,830
Okay. So La, so for,

223
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:52,000
for sure it gives it utility
Laga for that puts you here,

224
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,660
which is the same as the expected
utility of getting the ramp them gamble.

225
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,900
So that's what uh,
okay.

226
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:03,901
That's the modern theory of risk
aversion and it explains why people would

227
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:06,010
rather have things for sure.
Okay.

228
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:11,011
But it's now quantifiable because if
you can't have something for sure,

229
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,000
if you can't have something for sure,
then you know that it's more dangerous.

230
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,880
But with this concrete utility function,

231
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:23,680
you can find out exactly how much
you're willing to pay to transform.

232
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:27,070
You know,
this risky gamble into a safe gamble.

233
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,780
You'd give up this much expectation
in order to get the payoff for sure.

234
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,460
Okay. So we're going to
turn into something into a,

235
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:39,550
a vague theory into something quantifiable
and get a surprising conclusion.

236
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,550
Okay. So that's step one. We now think
about people maximizing utility. Well,

237
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,110
of course we thought about
that from the beginning.

238
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:50,800
The very first class you had utility
and diminishing margin utility.

239
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,130
So actually this risk aversion
with diminishing march and utility,

240
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,700
fortunately for us is exactly the
same thing we've been thinking about.

241
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:01,820
All along anyway, diminishing
margin, utility for consumption.

242
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:04,730
So the very assumption of diminishing
margin utility that we made from the

243
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:07,130
beginning is also
explaining risk aversion.

244
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,680
So it's incredibly fortunate that
we don't actually have to change.

245
00:15:10,681 --> 00:15:14,640
And I have our mathematics and
we've explained a new phenomenon.

246
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,280
Okay?
Now the,

247
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:23,030
the most simple utility function it
needs with a log one or the quadratic.

248
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,910
So remember you have that

249
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:31,090
equals a plus bx minus x squared.

250
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,070
Okay? Now I'm on, you know,
adding a constant is never
going to change anything.

251
00:15:36,071 --> 00:15:37,210
Saw,
he's going to write this

252
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,200
a x minus one half alpha x squared,

253
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,000
okay? That's going to be
my, uh, utility function,

254
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:51,180
my quadratic utility. It could be
like this, or it could be like that.

255
00:15:51,181 --> 00:15:53,550
If he had a constant, you know,
which doesn't depend on x,

256
00:15:53,551 --> 00:15:56,220
that's not changing what anybody does.
So that's irrelevant.

257
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,980
And if I divide it by a constant,
like B,

258
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,960
that's not going to change
what everybody does.

259
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:05,700
So I might as well as soon the quadratic
utility is x minus one half Alpha,

260
00:16:05,701 --> 00:16:09,160
x squared,
quadratic tilty.

261
00:16:09,161 --> 00:16:12,220
So that's about as simple as we can get
when we're used to working with those

262
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,170
kinds of utility functions.
Now,

263
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:18,950
why is that such a good
convenient thing for us to use?

264
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,540
It's because, let's suppose now
that you've got this random payoff

265
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,920
where with probability gamma one,

266
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:28,650
you're going to get an x
one properly gamma two,

267
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:33,660
you're going to get x to probability
gamma s you're going to get gamma s yes.

268
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,270
Is what's the expected utility.

269
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:41,271
The analog of renewing that means you is
going to equal summation ass equals one

270
00:16:42,631 --> 00:16:45,220
to s oh yeah,
Ma

271
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,160
s um,

272
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,650
x s minus one half alpha x s squared.

273
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,470
Okay,
so that's all we're doing.

274
00:16:56,471 --> 00:16:58,880
We're just saying that people
don't care about the payoffs.

275
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,040
If they have to evaluate getting x one
x two or x s they're going to take that

276
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,920
and multiply the payoff
by the expectation,

277
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:13,720
but not look at the payoff itself.
Look at the u, the utility of a payoff.

278
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,960
Quadratic is very simple.

279
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:19,960
And the reason why we're going to get
such a beautiful theory out of it is

280
00:17:19,961 --> 00:17:21,610
because this number,

281
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:25,480
you don't have to keep track of all
the x's to express this utility.

282
00:17:25,481 --> 00:17:28,810
We're going to be able to
summarize it incredibly simply.

283
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,990
This is going to equal some function,
right?

284
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,060
F of the expectation of x,
okay?

285
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,000
And the variance of x.

286
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,450
So all we're going to have to worry
about is the expectation of acts and the

287
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:43,220
variance of x and so many,

288
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:48,050
many very complicated things we can think
about very simply. So more generally,

289
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:49,770
if you put the log instead of the

290
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,280
quadratic utility,
we couldn't get this simplification.

291
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,700
And so the theory would have to be more
complicated. So the beautiful theory,

292
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:01,910
the capital asset pricing model comes
out of using this simple quadratic

293
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:06,650
utility. So why does it get
so simple verified? Well,

294
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,770
if I just write it out,

295
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:15,100
you is going to equal the
summation of gamma s ex Sas.

296
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,350
So this is s equals one to s.

297
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,130
I've let my probabilities began.
I don't know why I chose that.

298
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:27,370
Minus one half Alpha summation ass
equals one to ass of gamma s access.

299
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,650
Weird.
Okay,

300
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:39,190
well here we have the
expectation of x already.

301
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:44,860
Now what is this one? Fl for
gamma is excess squared. Well,

302
00:18:44,861 --> 00:18:49,290
if I wrote SAS minus the expectation of x,

303
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,020
okay, nice. Some this squared, hey,

304
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:57,150
that's equal,
the variance of x,

305
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:02,410
that's the deaf oops times gamma
ass by definition is the variance.

306
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,820
But if I wrote this out, what
would I get? I get summation.

307
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,530
S equals one s cam,
s excess squared,

308
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,950
okay? Which is what I have
over there. And then I'd have,

309
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:20,070
you know what I have
minus two times summation,

310
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:25,800
gamma s excess expectation of X.

311
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,241
Okay?

312
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:32,241
Plus summation s equals one s of
gamma s expectation of x squared.

313
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:46,770
Okay, but what? Uh, what's this?

314
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:51,540
The second term minus two times that
the expectation of acts is a constant.

315
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,030
So I can take that out.
Minus two.

316
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,120
Expectation of x can take this out and
notice that summation gamma us access,

317
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:03,060
that's the expectation of acts as well.

318
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,380
So that's just minus two times
the expectation of x squared.

319
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,550
And this I can take the
expectation of x squared out.

320
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,070
My summation of the probabilities is one.

321
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,290
So therefore I just
get equal to summation.

322
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:27,410
S equals one to ask Amma s s s squared
minus expectation of x squared.

323
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:34,580
So therefore this up here is
equal to the expectation of X.

324
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,420
Okay, so what have I got here?
I've got this term, sorry,

325
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:46,860
I've got the variance of
x equals this summation,

326
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,220
excess squared minus

327
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,660
expectation of x squared.

328
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:54,160
So this term equals the variance
of x plus expectation of x squared.

329
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:59,490
So therefore I've got this minus one
half Alpha expectation of x squared plus

330
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:07,770
minus one half Alpha variance of X.

331
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,940
Okay? That's what the, uh, that's what the
Algebra gives me. So why is that again?

332
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,570
Because the given quadratic
utility up here, that thing

333
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,950
getting old, you have in the quadratic
utility up there, I can write it as this.

334
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:27,160
And this term, this term is
obviously the expectation of eggs,

335
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:31,360
but this term is just the variance of X.
Okay?

336
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,930
Plus the expectation of x squared.
So when I subtract it,

337
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,950
I keep the expectation of x minus
the expectation of x squared.

338
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,480
That's the first term.

339
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:45,640
And then I've got minus the variance
of x from that term times the one Hass

340
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,301
Alpha.
Okay,

341
00:21:46,301 --> 00:21:51,100
so you see that depends on the
expectation of x in a positive way.

342
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:56,530
Assuming Alpha's a small number and in
a negative way on the variance of x.

343
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,830
So just as I said somewhere

344
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,680
I said it was going to turn out
like that and it did right here,

345
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:10,130
the utility is equal to the expectation
of acts and the variance of x in a

346
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:14,520
positive way on the expectation of acts
and in a negative way and the variance.

347
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,710
Okay, so now we're ready
to start the analysis.

348
00:22:19,711 --> 00:22:22,050
We've, we've said, okay,

349
00:22:22,051 --> 00:22:26,310
so far we've assumed people
only care about the expectation.

350
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,370
And then we said, well, we know they
don't really care about the expectations.

351
00:22:29,371 --> 00:22:30,630
Hedge funds and everybody else.

352
00:22:30,631 --> 00:22:33,720
If they know what they're
doing and they're trying to
keep their investors happy,

353
00:22:33,721 --> 00:22:36,660
they're going to hedge.
We didn't say why they're going to hedge.

354
00:22:36,661 --> 00:22:40,500
We just asserted they like to hedge so
their investors don't get mad at them.

355
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,240
But really what we had in mind is the
investors have some utility function.

356
00:22:45,241 --> 00:22:47,610
They don't like risk. So the, so the,

357
00:22:47,611 --> 00:22:50,580
the hedge fund is going to try
and keep the payoffs steady,

358
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,760
but there's a trade off. You know,
you can't eliminate all risk.

359
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:58,260
So how much is the hedge fund and the
investor going to suffer if all risk is

360
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,420
eliminated?
Now we have a way of quantifying it.

361
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:05,040
People care about the utility and
not about just the expected payoff.

362
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,110
And so you add more risk to them.

363
00:23:07,111 --> 00:23:10,830
You replace a shore thing with a
risky thing with the same expectation.

364
00:23:10,831 --> 00:23:14,040
They think it's worth that much worse.
Okay.

365
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:18,420
And so we've said that of all
the myriad of utility functions,

366
00:23:18,421 --> 00:23:21,000
we could use log,
you know,

367
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:25,320
some exponential e to the
minus eight x x to the,

368
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,720
are there lots of different
utilities we could use?

369
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,710
We're going to deal with the quadratic
because it has the simple property that

370
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:36,630
in evaluating an entire risky proposition,
people care about the expectation,

371
00:23:36,631 --> 00:23:38,730
which is what they cared about before.

372
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,690
But they're punishing themselves
for getting a bad variance.

373
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,080
Okay.

374
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,110
Okay. So because that's
such a simple thing to say,

375
00:23:48,111 --> 00:23:52,010
we're going to get a simple conclusion
and a very surprising conclusion.

376
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,510
Okay.

377
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:58,510
So let's now analyze a problem
and see what would happen.

378
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:05,000
Okay. So the problem I'm going
to choose to analyze is this one,

379
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:10,430
I'm going to say that they're three
things can happen in the economy.

380
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,560
Oles with probability.
Sorry. Uh, the first three.

381
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,960
Anyway, those are the
probabilities. Yeah. Okay. Now,

382
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,570
there are many firms in
the economy, a, B, and c,

383
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,490
and let's say the first farm,
I don't want to invent the numbers here,

384
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,970
so I might as well just
write down the ones I picked.

385
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,600
The first one is going to be 50 or 175.

386
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,383
Okay.

387
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,251
Hey,
B,

388
00:24:42,251 --> 00:24:47,251
the other firm's going to be
one 51 88 and three 65 and see,

389
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:54,010
it's going to be 300,
two 20

390
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,780
and 60.
And I'm going to say,

391
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:03,290
so those are the three things that can
happen and the payoff of the three firms.

392
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:07,570
And let's say there are two agents,
ancient Alpha,

393
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,160
uh, owns, uh,

394
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,320
a and also

395
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:21,030
133.5 units of x Zero K and Beta owns B
and C and I may have reversed these two

396
00:25:31,741 --> 00:25:36,440
guys. Uh, okay, in 66.5

397
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:42,950
units of that zero. Okay, so here we go.

398
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:44,750
So by a Alpha and Beta,

399
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:48,560
I mean there were a million Alpha agents
in a million Beta agents and you know,

400
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:49,221
they,
you know,

401
00:25:49,221 --> 00:25:52,400
so everything can be scaled by a million
because I want a bigger economy like we

402
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:55,190
always have. Okay? So there we have it.

403
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:00,470
We've got now a risky world.
Things can happen to the, okay,

404
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:01,730
so what are the utilities,

405
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:06,590
let's say utility now of
Alpha is going to equal.

406
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,050
So I left out the main point.

407
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:14,180
Utility of Alpha is going
to equal a half x zero.

408
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,670
I just made up these numbers by the
way, they're not. So summation, uh,

409
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:24,970
s equals one to three gamma s
that's the gamma s up there times x,

410
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,800
s minus one over 400 x s squared

411
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:37,770
the states. So there's ass
one. So here are the states.

412
00:26:37,771 --> 00:26:42,771
This is state one as equals one
s equals two and s equals three.

413
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,340
Those are the three possible

414
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,820
states just like we had
before with this payoff.

415
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,950
And those are the payoff
of all the assets.

416
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,173
Oh,

417
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:01,370
Alpha ohms from a which is producing
that output in the three states and also

418
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:06,240
owns 133.5 units of x zero.
So over here,

419
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:11,270
Alpha's owning 133.5 and Betas owning
65.5 at of consumption at time zero.

420
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,780
So this is time zero.
This is time one

421
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,400
the end of the year.
So by the end of the year,

422
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:28,110
something is going to happen. There's a
lot of uncertainty between now and then.

423
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,610
Some of the firms are going to be paying
off in some of the states and badly in

424
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:37,300
other states and so on.
Okay.

425
00:27:37,301 --> 00:27:39,310
And so the utility function for Alpha,

426
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:43,510
so he cares about consumption at time
zero and also in each of the three states.

427
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,780
Okay. But now he's going to
have these quadratic utilities.

428
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,690
He's going to say to himself,
um,

429
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,010
I care about my consumption and whatever
I'm going to cut. If I consumed,

430
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:59,140
if I just hung on to my AA in state one,
this would be okay if I,

431
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,550
if I never traded, I just hung on to a,
the utility function would be, you know,

432
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:04,220
this uh,

433
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:08,480
quadratic thing of one 33.5,
so it'll be um,

434
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:14,020
one 33.5 minus one over 400,

435
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:17,420
one 33.5 squared.

436
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,190
Okay. Plus, um,

437
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:27,490
he would end up with 50 minus a one over
400 times 50 squared times a quarter

438
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:38,930
plus, you know, 100 minus one over 400,

439
00:28:38,931 --> 00:28:43,931
100 squared times a quarter plus 75
minus one over 475 squared times a half.

440
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,900
That would be as utility if he
never traded. If you just stuck

441
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,680
to a,
he,

442
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,680
he eat his own consultant in
endowment one 33.5 at time zero.

443
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,140
Oh that isn't true. I wrote down
the wrong utility at time zero.

444
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:07,150
I said it's time zero utilities a
half x zero. So it's a half one 33.5.

445
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:11,170
Okay, so you get a half
one 33.5 but in the future,

446
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,420
yeah,

447
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:16,380
he'd get this and he'd
get 50 in state one. Okay,

448
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,640
so a hundred in state two
and 75 and stage three.

449
00:29:20,641 --> 00:29:22,350
And that's the utility he ended up with.

450
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:26,070
But that's not very good for him
because he's running this gigantic risk.

451
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:29,580
He's got this risk at time.
You know,

452
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,610
it's state one is a disaster for
him if he just sticks to that.

453
00:29:32,611 --> 00:29:36,180
So he doesn't want to stick to that.
So how should we evaluate the shares?

454
00:29:36,181 --> 00:29:37,014
Affirm a,

455
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:41,130
how should you evaluate you and all the
shares are from B when she could get,

456
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,110
if he gave up some of a or how
should evaluate the firm, you know,

457
00:29:44,111 --> 00:29:47,230
shares a see what should he do?
Okay.

458
00:29:47,231 --> 00:29:50,770
So Beta has a similar utility.

459
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,670
Betas,
utility you Beta

460
00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:01,170
is going to equal one three quarters x
zero plus the summation s equals one to

461
00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:07,780
three Ama s times x,

462
00:30:07,781 --> 00:30:12,460
s minus one over 800 x s squared.

463
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:28,380
Okay. So I've made these guys far from
being impatient. They seem to, uh,

464
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:32,720
they seem to prefer a consuming in
the future till now. But, um, okay,

465
00:30:32,721 --> 00:30:35,780
that was poor choice of numbers.
But lets you know the, these, this,

466
00:30:35,781 --> 00:30:38,330
this number should be bigger than one
and this should be bigger than one.

467
00:30:38,331 --> 00:30:42,800
But anyway, uh, I, I put a
half and three quarters. Okay.

468
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:45,770
So there's impatience built in
except it goes the wrong way.

469
00:30:45,771 --> 00:30:49,850
That was just poor choice of numbers.
But the rest of it, oh, uh, you know,

470
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,500
expresses their risk aversion.

471
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,110
So Alpha is looking at the
expected payoff of what,

472
00:30:55,111 --> 00:30:56,780
or he gets to consume in the future,

473
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,170
but he's punishing
himself by the variance.

474
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:03,350
So you look at this formula all you see,
it's not just the expectation,

475
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,340
but he loses something because of
the variance. And similarly, Beta,

476
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,140
he's looking at consumption today.

477
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:13,190
He's adding to that the expectation of
his consumption tomorrow for his utility,

478
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,790
but he's punishing himself for
having variance in the future.

479
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:23,700
So it's exactly what we
formalize Shakespeare's idea
of people not liking to be

480
00:31:26,081 --> 00:31:29,710
exposed to variants to uncertainty,

481
00:31:29,711 --> 00:31:34,480
which we've quantified by
calling variants. Okay.

482
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:37,000
Is everyone with me now? Yes, go
ahead. I'm glad you had a quick,

483
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,550
I just made up those numbers though.

484
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,890
That's the utility of Alpha
and that's the utility of Beta.

485
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:48,510
I could pick any people I wanted. I just
picked those two people. Okay. Now what?

486
00:31:48,511 --> 00:31:52,260
How do they differ? Which person is
more afraid of risk than the other?

487
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,303
Yeah.

488
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,940
Is Alpha or Beta more afraid of risk?

489
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,970
Alpha is more afraid of risk,
right?

490
00:32:01,971 --> 00:32:06,971
This one over 800 is smaller than one
over 400 so Beta doesn't really care that

491
00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:09,860
much about risk. Oh cares. But you know,

492
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:13,670
it's not going to punish himself too
much by, by being exposed to risk.

493
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:17,600
Alpha is not going to punish himself too
much, but he's going to punish himself,

494
00:32:17,601 --> 00:32:21,650
you know, somewhat more. So
Alpha is more risk averse.

495
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,100
Alpha is more afraid of risk,

496
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,303
it seems.

497
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:32,681
Okay.

498
00:32:32,681 --> 00:32:37,681
So I've taken two agents who are afraid
of risk ones more afraid than the other,

499
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,660
and I've put them in an economy where
they're risky things that could happen.

500
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,180
And so we now have,

501
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:50,230
we not want to work out a
more sophisticated version
of pricing and EVAC will

502
00:32:51,461 --> 00:32:52,940
Librium than we had before.

503
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:58,180
So let me remind you that what we sort
of have been supposing up until now is

504
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:01,910
that the price,
what would the price of a B,

505
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:06,800
if we didn't think about risk aversion,
you would so far what we would say,

506
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:13,110
what would you say the price of a is
price.

507
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:17,340
Affirm a, hey, if we didn't,
you know, if we were naive,

508
00:33:17,341 --> 00:33:21,270
you might say it's a quarter, by the way,
I hope I haven't those probabilities.

509
00:33:21,271 --> 00:33:24,250
Right. I didn't, you know,

510
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,510
it's like you'd say
it's a quarter times 50

511
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,640
what's a quarter times a hundred

512
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:33,330
okay.

513
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:37,680
What's a halftime? 75 is that what
you would have said? Up until now?

514
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,150
Even up until now, we would have been
more sophisticated than that. Discounted.

515
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:50,000
Okay. Times discounted. Okay.

516
00:33:50,001 --> 00:33:54,050
That's what we've sort of figured up
until now. That's the logical thing to do.

517
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,990
Well,
but we ignored risk aversion

518
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:03,530
and we ignored it at our peril
because it's obviously important.

519
00:34:03,531 --> 00:34:05,600
I mean Shakespeare,
a literary person,

520
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:09,440
he understood already 400 years ago
that risk aversion was important.

521
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,860
And their facts that
confirm what Shakespeare is.

522
00:34:12,861 --> 00:34:17,540
Intuition is the stock market historically
has had a lot higher return than the

523
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:20,720
bond market. You know, even though
with the last stock market crash,

524
00:34:20,721 --> 00:34:22,460
of course it came back a lot,
you know,

525
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:27,461
average since 1926 the stock markets
made something like 9% a year compared to

526
00:34:27,651 --> 00:34:29,630
two and a half percent
and the bond market.

527
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,680
So there's a huge disparity and after
over such a long period of time,

528
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:36,860
it can't just be, it was luckier
every year after year after year,

529
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:40,190
somehow people must have realized
the stock market's riskier.

530
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,980
And so as Shakespeare said,
they wanted a higher return,

531
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:46,480
meaning they were playing out a
lower price, but how much lower,

532
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,910
how can you figure out how much lower?
So in this example, in other words,

533
00:34:49,911 --> 00:34:51,200
what is the price of a,

534
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:56,230
so this is the wrong price of a apparently
because it doesn't recognize risk

535
00:34:56,331 --> 00:35:00,540
aversion. Okay, so what would,

536
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,510
okay, so that's where
we are. So everybody,

537
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,440
any questions about what the question is?
We're about to give an answer,

538
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:11,520
but what do you see what the question
is that our old methodology for figuring

539
00:35:11,521 --> 00:35:13,190
out prices,
um,

540
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,400
there's taking expectation and discounting
obviously can't be right because it

541
00:35:17,401 --> 00:35:20,130
doesn't recognize risk aversion.
On the other hand,

542
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,980
we always had a utility function
in there from the beginning,

543
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,630
even a quadratic one.

544
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,740
So all we have to do is do what we did
before and put it in a quadratic utility

545
00:35:28,741 --> 00:35:30,720
and we'll probably get the right answer.
Okay,

546
00:35:30,721 --> 00:35:34,350
so that's exactly what we're going to do.
So Arrow

547
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,080
in 1950,

548
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:41,160
this is the same guy who proved with
the brew the Predo efficiency of

549
00:35:41,161 --> 00:35:45,690
equilibrium. He was my thesis
advisor. He said, you know,

550
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,380
we can do the same trick that Fisher did,

551
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,680
so only heat.
For some reason he never credited Fisher.

552
00:35:52,681 --> 00:35:57,300
I could never quite figure that out. He
had some obscure Danish guy he credited.

553
00:35:57,301 --> 00:35:59,730
But anyway,
apply Fisher trick

554
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,310
trek and assume,

555
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,250
uh,
from dividends.

556
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,450
Dividends

557
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:20,180
are part
of a endowments.

558
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,503
Look

559
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:25,371
for g.

560
00:36:25,371 --> 00:36:30,220
E the general lack of
Librium trading outputs,

561
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,990
trading, you know, trading gourds. Okay.

562
00:36:37,991 --> 00:36:42,190
Then go back to find out,
then go back to deduce

563
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,130
value of firms.

564
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,030
Okay.

565
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:52,680
Okay. Now what goods are we trading
here? That was a conceptual advance.

566
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,440
We call them Arrow.

567
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,050
Okay.

568
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,440
And then the brew got involved to Aero De.

569
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,810
So de Bruin was the gale
assistant professor,

570
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,750
while Arrow was a Stanford
assistant professor.

571
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:10,580
So Arrow Debreu state
contingent commodities.

572
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:19,190
And so justice Fisher said an
apple today and an apple next year,

573
00:37:19,191 --> 00:37:20,180
even though they're identical,

574
00:37:20,181 --> 00:37:23,720
apples are different commodities with
different prices because they come at

575
00:37:23,721 --> 00:37:25,310
different places in time.
In fact,

576
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:29,900
most people would prefer the apple today
to the apple next year. So Aero said,

577
00:37:29,901 --> 00:37:33,870
okay.
On apple in the top state map,

578
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,000
when the top state

579
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,880
an apple in the top state is a different
commodity for the same apple in the

580
00:37:40,881 --> 00:37:43,910
second state. Okay? So it
should have a different price.

581
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,480
So we've got to start conventional
equilibrium according to Arrow,

582
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:50,990
where as long as you have these Arrow
state contingent commodities that you can

583
00:37:50,991 --> 00:37:53,950
trade trading today,
you can bond.

584
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,170
You can imagine today buying
an apple if state one occurs,

585
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:01,400
but not having to get the apple of state
two or stage three occurs and that will

586
00:38:01,401 --> 00:38:02,690
have a price p one.

587
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:06,410
And today you could imagine buying the
apple of state two occurs a different

588
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:08,200
price from the apple of state.

589
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:11,240
One occurs and also an
apple of state three occurs,

590
00:38:11,241 --> 00:38:14,360
which obviously is going to be more
expensive or it looks like it'll be more

591
00:38:14,361 --> 00:38:18,140
expensive than the other apples
because it's 50% likely to happen.

592
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,620
And those are the prices
we have to look for.

593
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:26,890
And that's going to solve our problem
because the prices of the Arrow securities

594
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:31,160
are going to be different
maybe from the probabilities.

595
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:36,040
And that's what will reflect the fact
that when everybody's trying to hedge and

596
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:39,190
not everybody can do it, you're going
to have to change the tradeoffs.

597
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,520
So we've already seen this in our
gambling thing, at least the prices.

598
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,970
Remember with our bookies,
the bookies were effectively willing.

599
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:50,140
Remember there were two outcomes, you
know the Yankees win or the Phillies win.

600
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:53,320
And if you paid,
you know you could get the bookie.

601
00:38:53,321 --> 00:38:58,090
Who thought the odds were 60 40 by
paying 60 cents today, the book,

602
00:38:58,091 --> 00:39:01,180
he was going to give you a dollar if the
Yankees won are paying 40 cents today,

603
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:05,140
the book you will give you a, you
know, a dollar for the Phillies won.

604
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,960
So we've already had these aero contracts,

605
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:12,760
these arrows securities implicitly in
our equilibrium and those 60 40 odds,

606
00:39:12,761 --> 00:39:14,970
those were the opinions of the bookie,

607
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:19,090
maybe not the actual probabilities.
We said, you know those,

608
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,630
the final betting odds,
depending on what the other book is,

609
00:39:22,631 --> 00:39:25,570
we're willing to give it didn't
have to correspond to reality.

610
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,070
There might not be a reality.
Even.

611
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:32,260
So here there's a reality 25 25 50
but that doesn't mean that the odds,

612
00:39:32,261 --> 00:39:35,320
the prices that are going to quote it in
the market will turn out to be that we

613
00:39:35,321 --> 00:39:37,540
have to solve for echo
Librium and see what they are.

614
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,163
Okay.

615
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,910
Okay, so what's going to happen while we
can solve for echo Librium very easily.

616
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,540
We've done this a million times before

617
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:55,300
and I've chosen linear quadratic utility.

618
00:39:55,301 --> 00:40:00,301
He's the kind we did on the very first
day of class because those are easiest to

619
00:40:01,751 --> 00:40:03,100
solve for equilibrium.

620
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,850
You don't have to do get involved in
the budget sat or anything complicated.

621
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:11,380
You just set margin utility equal
to price. So we know for Alpha,

622
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,053
sorry,

623
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:18,240
we know that the margin utility of Alpha
at times zero divided by the price is

624
00:40:19,131 --> 00:40:24,131
zero is going to have to equal the
margin utility of Alpha and each state as

625
00:40:25,121 --> 00:40:30,070
times the price ps, so the equilibrium,
the Arrow to brew equilibrium.

626
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,853
Okay?

627
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:39,530
Equilibrium is going to involve p Zero p
one p two and p three the prices of the

628
00:40:41,931 --> 00:40:44,450
Arrow securities,
the present value prices.

629
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,540
P Zero is what you pay today
to get the apple today.

630
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:52,280
P One is what you pay today to get the
apple a year from now in state one.

631
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:56,390
So these are the present value.
Present value.

632
00:40:56,391 --> 00:41:00,020
That's what Fisher would say.
State contingent,

633
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,370
yeah,

634
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:07,780
prices. The state contingent
is what Arrow added. Now,

635
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:10,990
you may ask whether there really are
these arrows securities floating in the

636
00:41:10,991 --> 00:41:12,820
economy. And we're going to
come back to that question,

637
00:41:12,821 --> 00:41:17,821
but you could imagine all these Arrow
Debreu state contingent prices and

638
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:22,120
commodities, and those would be the
prices we'd solve for equilibrium.

639
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:27,040
So we get this over this
margin utility of that. Okay,

640
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:32,041
so what is this and similarly for
Beta marginal utility Beta at over

641
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,610
the prices,

642
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:39,610
zero equals margin utility
Beta s over the price of s.

643
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,770
So what is this for Alpha?

644
00:41:42,771 --> 00:41:46,190
His marginal utility of
consumption is a half.

645
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,760
Okay. We might as well assume the
price at one of the prices is one.

646
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:55,070
Let's take this price to be one.
Okay,

647
00:41:55,071 --> 00:41:57,950
so Beta her prices three quart,

648
00:41:57,951 --> 00:42:02,780
her margin Tillys three quarters in the
price is one. What's his margin utility?

649
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,470
It's in any state ass.

650
00:42:06,471 --> 00:42:11,471
It's Gamma s the Ama s times

651
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,730
times one.
Okay.

652
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:19,200
Minus one over 200 times x.
S

653
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:25,270
so just differentiated this.
I got one minus two over 400 times excess.

654
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,850
And what's her margin utility?

655
00:42:28,851 --> 00:42:33,851
It's gamma s and stayed s times one
minus one over 400 times excess.

656
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,833
Okay.

657
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:43,110
Okay. So I know an equilibrium
that's going to imply

658
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,070
that
one half.

659
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,553
Hmm.

660
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:55,770
Well, now I have to screw around
here. So how am I going to,

661
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:57,320
so I've got this thing right

662
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,570
over here.
A half equals this thing over here.

663
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,630
What over ps.
Ah,

664
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:11,400
glad that appeared. I was getting
worried there. Thank you. Over a PS.

665
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:16,000
Okay, that helps a lot.
Uh, the whole thing.

666
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:21,600
So that implies that something like x.

667
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,810
So this is what Alpha is going to do
and this is what Beta is going to do.

668
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:28,920
So this implies acts Alpha s equals what?

669
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:34,180
So if I multiply through
by 200 and I bring ps over,

670
00:43:34,181 --> 00:43:36,820
gam asked the other side
and I do a bunch of stuff.

671
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:42,290
I'm going to guess this is 200
minus 100 a p s over gamma ass.

672
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,280
How do you think that's going to play?
Right?

673
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:50,110
Peoria. Let's see if I'm
all the way through by ps.

674
00:43:50,111 --> 00:43:53,860
I get from all the flights
through by ps over gamma ass.

675
00:43:53,861 --> 00:43:56,020
I got ps over GAM ass times a half.

676
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:01,380
Then I multiply everything through by 200
so I get a hundred ps over gamma s and

677
00:44:01,871 --> 00:44:05,020
then I get the 200 here.
So,

678
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:08,490
and the excess goes to the other side and
the ps over gas goes to the other side.

679
00:44:08,491 --> 00:44:11,730
So it's 200 minus 100 ps over gamma s and

680
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,110
one is going to be x.

681
00:44:14,111 --> 00:44:18,090
Beta s is going to equal,
well,

682
00:44:18,091 --> 00:44:22,480
I'll have to do the same trick here
except the only multiplying through by 400

683
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,070
and taking three quarters,

684
00:44:24,071 --> 00:44:28,270
which is 300 so it will be 300 minus.

685
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:31,763
MMM,

686
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:32,923
okay.

687
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,140
No, that was wrong. 400

688
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,473
okay.

689
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,940
Minus 300 over ps over here.

690
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:42,873
Damn man.

691
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,590
Okay. Because of my multiply
through by 400 put ps over Ghana,

692
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:54,281
us and the other side.

693
00:44:54,281 --> 00:44:59,140
I have three quarters ps over gamma
as times 400 which is 300 ps over GAM.

694
00:44:59,141 --> 00:45:03,670
As this becomes a 400 and the ps GAM
has went away. So I have that. Okay.

695
00:45:03,671 --> 00:45:07,450
So I know now if I could
figure out what the prices are,

696
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:12,010
I know what everybody would
demand in every state. Okay, so

697
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:18,550
not, okay. So let me pause here. That was
the first critical step. So what did I do?

698
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:23,620
I said, it's a long story. Lot
of years went into this. I said,

699
00:45:23,621 --> 00:45:27,310
people are risk averse. Shakespeare
knew that. We want to quantify it.

700
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:31,780
So we say people of concave utility
functions that quantifies risk aversion.

701
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,040
We want to make a simple concave utility
function. We pick quadratic, okay.

702
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:37,540
But of course we don't
know what quadratic,

703
00:45:37,541 --> 00:45:40,150
different people could have different
quadratic utility functions.

704
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,570
Then we do the Fisher trick
and say that any equilibrium,

705
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:47,560
as long as you can buy and sell every
contingent commodity in the future,

706
00:45:47,561 --> 00:45:49,300
cause the,
all the arrows securities are there,

707
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:53,140
it can always be reduced to general
equilibrium just like we did before.

708
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:58,500
And so now you have to feed the endowments
into the agents and the payoff of the

709
00:45:59,411 --> 00:46:03,610
dividends into the agent's
endowments. Okay? Um,

710
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:06,190
but here, so we're going to,
we haven't done that yet.

711
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,410
And then we solve for
supply equals demand.

712
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,350
So all we have to do is we have to have

713
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:14,690
ex Alpha s plus X.

714
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:19,690
Beta s has to equal in downwind of Alpha
an s plus the endowment of Beta and

715
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:27,170
ass. Okay? But this equals all right,
so we'll have to do that for every s.

716
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:29,990
So this is a 200

717
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:36,640
minus 100 ps over GAM s equals um,

718
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:43,320
okay, now I have to do it in state one.
All right, so equals whatever they are.

719
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:47,250
So what is endowment avast and
down one of Alpha and ask Wilson,

720
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:51,840
downwind Beta vets. We have to look at
each state separately. And Lo and behold,

721
00:46:51,841 --> 00:46:55,260
I picked the numbers so that
if you add these all together,

722
00:46:55,380 --> 00:47:00,380
you get 500 and here you get to 80 and
two 20 is also 500 and here you get 500

723
00:47:02,701 --> 00:47:06,060
again.
So Lo and behold,

724
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:08,910
there is no aggregate risk in the economy,

725
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:11,220
although the individual stocks are risky,

726
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:15,420
the aggregate is totally unrisky.
So I could pull it.

727
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:18,720
So matter what s is,
I could put in 500 here.

728
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:22,230
I'm going to turn out that the
total endowment of both people,

729
00:47:22,231 --> 00:47:24,990
because I've plugged the dividends
into their personal endowments,

730
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,400
added up the two people.

731
00:47:26,401 --> 00:47:31,401
It's 500 so it means that
ps over gamma s equals

732
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:38,623
what?

733
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:45,210
Which I have forgotten something
for sure. One Oh, x Beta.

734
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:47,460
Yeah,
so that's Alpha.

735
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,113
Thank you.

736
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:58,260
Glad 400 minus 300 p s over
gamma as equals 500 okay,

737
00:48:02,621 --> 00:48:06,060
so if I add this up,
I get 600 um,

738
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:11,430
minus 400 p s over gamma acid equals 500
so then I flipped on the other side and

739
00:48:12,941 --> 00:48:17,941
I get Pete s over gamma s equals a
corridors because 500 from here is 100 and

740
00:48:19,331 --> 00:48:22,410
put the 400 and the other side
divide by it. I get ps over GAM.

741
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:26,980
I asked equals a quarter for all
tasks. Okay. So what did I find?

742
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,450
I found that in this
and so every,

743
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:35,380
so it's the same ps over
gamma s is the same. Okay.

744
00:48:35,381 --> 00:48:36,670
Same in all states.

745
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,210
Okay.
So what would the price of a be here?

746
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,790
What's the price of a,
an equilibrium?

747
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,780
What's the price of a, I'm going
to take the price of a shouldn't be

748
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:02,390
price of a,

749
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:07,660
shouldn't be p one times 50 plus p two
times a hundred plus p three times 75 and

750
00:49:12,801 --> 00:49:13,790
what does that equal?

751
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,393
Okay,

752
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:20,970
well p one is just a
quarter times gamma one,

753
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,860
right?
P One over gamma one is a quarter,

754
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:29,600
p two is a quarter times gamma two and p
three is a quarter times gamma three so

755
00:49:30,341 --> 00:49:33,190
I just got this multiplied by a quarter.

756
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,370
So in fact all I did is I
did what I had always done.

757
00:49:36,371 --> 00:49:40,600
I took the expected payoff and discounted
it. But discount rate is a quarter.

758
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,970
What's the price of the riskless asset?

759
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:49,020
Pi of one one one is just going to be
a quarter because it's a quarter times

760
00:49:49,981 --> 00:49:52,300
gamble, one plus a quarter defense
gamma tube. What's the core of times?

761
00:49:52,301 --> 00:49:56,080
Gamma three gamma one. Gamma two. Both
Gamma three is one. So it's a quarter.

762
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,990
So it implies the risk,
less interest rate as what?

763
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:06,750
What's the risk plus interest rate?
300% okay.

764
00:50:06,751 --> 00:50:09,540
And that's why the disk,
so we're discounting by one over record.

765
00:50:09,541 --> 00:50:13,020
Because the interest rate is 300%
so basically nothing happened.

766
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:17,520
We got all the prices exactly as we would
compute them with expect with, without,

767
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:20,790
you know, just doing expectations.
We got the right discount rate.

768
00:50:20,791 --> 00:50:22,590
All we had to do was figure
out the discount. Right?

769
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:26,280
So risk hasn't played any role.
And why didn't it play any role?

770
00:50:26,281 --> 00:50:30,680
Because although Alpha
started off owning a alone,

771
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:34,130
which exposed her,
I forgot who was her and who was him.

772
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:36,200
Let's say her exposed
her to a lot of risk.

773
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,990
She's not going to sit there
stupidly just holding a,

774
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:42,320
she's going to trade it for B and
C for different shares. In fact,

775
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:46,640
she's going to end up holding her
consumption. This is her consumption.

776
00:50:46,641 --> 00:50:48,890
200 minus 100 ps over gamma's.

777
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:53,030
This number doesn't depend on s she's
going to consume the same thing in every

778
00:50:53,031 --> 00:50:56,000
state by the and how can she do that?

779
00:50:56,150 --> 00:51:01,100
She can own equal shares of Ab and C,
she'll own a share of the whole economy.

780
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,170
So in other words, by
diversifying, by diversifying,

781
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:08,380
okay.

782
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:13,380
Alpha and Beta each get rid of all risks.

783
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:20,540
So instead of calling it diversifying,
I could call it hedging.

784
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:24,230
The same thing.
She doesn't just hold her a,

785
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:28,790
she mixes BNC with it so that
she gets a payoff of consumption.

786
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:33,590
That's exactly the same in every state
because ps over gas is independent of the

787
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,480
state.
She'll always consume the same thing.

788
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:38,900
Everybody can hedge perfectly and
there's no problem because there's no

789
00:51:38,901 --> 00:51:43,190
aggregate risks that anyone has to be
stuck with and therefore the price is just

790
00:51:43,191 --> 00:51:46,790
going to be the same as the
probabilities, you know, discounted.

791
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,370
And that's the theory
we've worked with so far.

792
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:52,550
So so far you could say that
everything we did was kosher.

793
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:56,240
It's just that when we
had these two different
probabilities of things happening

794
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:57,103
up or down,

795
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,030
we thought that the aggregate economy
would have the same endowments here as it

796
00:52:02,031 --> 00:52:05,910
did there. And therefore the
probabilities we used, worthy, worthy,

797
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:07,700
objective probabilities,
discounted.

798
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:11,660
No reason to change them because
nobody's going to be forced not to hedge.

799
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:16,370
Everybody will hedge [inaudible] there
any questions about what I've said?

800
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:20,480
I'm sure there should be a question cause
I can't have said it as clearly as I

801
00:52:20,481 --> 00:52:25,480
ought to have. So with
somebody like to say something.

802
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:28,123
Yes.

803
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:33,623
Right.

804
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:38,900
This is the new price with the one
quarter. This is the correct new price.

805
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:42,800
So the theory so far hasn't
changed in any interesting way.

806
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:46,400
We just found the discount rate.
It just looks like expected utility.

807
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,450
But you shouldn't have expected it to
change because the aggregate endowment was

808
00:52:50,451 --> 00:52:53,360
500 the constant in every state.
Nobody,

809
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:58,100
there's no reason why we can't have
everybody perfectly hedged and consuming a

810
00:52:58,101 --> 00:53:01,670
constant in every state. And in fact
that's what we did have everybody,

811
00:53:01,671 --> 00:53:03,680
she consumed the same
thing in every state.

812
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:05,750
He consumed the same thing in every state.

813
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:09,560
No reason why they both couldn't hedge
themselves perfectly and an equilibrium.

814
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:10,790
That's exactly what they did.

815
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:13,460
Okay.

816
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,360
Any other,
yes.

817
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:20,770
Would you create?

818
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,760
Okay,
so the next is going to be,

819
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:29,880
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to
assume that the endowment is don't add

820
00:53:29,881 --> 00:53:32,730
up to a constant and every state
then what's going to happen.

821
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,670
So this is not at all obvious
how to solve this and what to do,

822
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:39,210
but it's going to turn out to have a
beautiful, simple answer. Shocking,

823
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:41,850
not only simple,
but also surprising.

824
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:45,910
So any before I do that,
I'm going to change the endowment.

825
00:53:45,911 --> 00:53:50,100
So they're not all a constant. Any
questions about where we're going? Yup.

826
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:54,350
Okay.

827
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:58,490
Yes. What I Prue okay, so
thank you for the question.

828
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:00,650
Okay,
so I went a little quickly.

829
00:54:00,651 --> 00:54:05,651
I said that what we proved by solving
for the general equilibrium is that the

830
00:54:06,261 --> 00:54:10,460
price in every state was just going
to be a quarter times the probability.

831
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:13,940
Okay? That's what we showed had
to happen in, in equilibrium.

832
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:18,860
Now what's the consequence of that? The
consequences are twofold. Number one,

833
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,660
the price of all the assets is the same
expectation when I easily would have

834
00:54:23,661 --> 00:54:28,340
taken before where we use the
discount rate a quarter. Okay,

835
00:54:28,341 --> 00:54:30,770
so that,
and that's the first implication.

836
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,610
The second implication is that
from the formula for consumption,

837
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:39,560
we noticed that she consumes the same
amount in all three states because ps over

838
00:54:39,561 --> 00:54:42,580
gamma ass is a quarter in all
three states for consumption.

839
00:54:42,581 --> 00:54:45,740
Is going to be the same in all
three states and his consumption,

840
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:47,060
which will be different from hers,

841
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:49,880
but his will be the same in
all three states as well.

842
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:54,880
The tool will add up to 500 so then
I took a little bit of a leap and I

843
00:54:55,311 --> 00:54:59,330
interpreted that conclusion that her
consumption doesn't depend on the state.

844
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,250
What's the interpretation of that?

845
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:06,400
She has obviously some are behind the
scenes given up some of her Aa to get BNC

846
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:11,690
and held them in a mixture, a so as to
get the same consumption in every state.

847
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,460
What must the mixture be?

848
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,510
Obviously she held the
same proportion of a, B,

849
00:55:17,511 --> 00:55:22,010
and c because those add up to 500500500
so she must have held the same

850
00:55:22,011 --> 00:55:26,460
proportion of a, B and c, a fraction of
the market and got a riskless payoff.

851
00:55:26,461 --> 00:55:29,270
So she diversified.
She didn't just stick with her a,

852
00:55:29,271 --> 00:55:31,440
she substituted a little bit of a,

853
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:35,150
a little bit of being a little bit of
see a different boat on every ocean and

854
00:55:35,151 --> 00:55:37,700
now she runs no risk at all.
So she diversified.

855
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,590
But in the language we use last time,

856
00:55:39,591 --> 00:55:42,380
I could call diversification
hedging if I wanted to.

857
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,460
She just sort of sold Arrow securities
in the right proportions to turn her a

858
00:55:46,461 --> 00:55:49,490
into something that was
completely riskless. Okay.

859
00:55:49,491 --> 00:55:51,920
So whether you call it
diversifying or call it hedging,

860
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:56,390
she's achieved the same end of totally
balancing her consumption and everybody,

861
00:55:56,391 --> 00:55:59,990
he did the same thing and they both can
do it because the aggregate consumption

862
00:55:59,991 --> 00:56:00,824
was a constant

863
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:02,853
yes.

864
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:10,260
In real life. Okay. The
closest we've come to an Arrow,

865
00:56:10,261 --> 00:56:13,740
security in real life is a cds.

866
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:17,370
And this is part of the reason why
these economists, Larry Summers,

867
00:56:17,371 --> 00:56:20,970
my classmate and Ruben who you know,

868
00:56:20,971 --> 00:56:25,971
who was the secretary of the Treasury
and Ran City Corp and who was a Yale law

869
00:56:26,351 --> 00:56:29,680
school student in the
Harvard undergraduate and
who I sat on many committees

870
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:33,970
with, um, he, they were seduced
by the, okay, so watts of CDs,

871
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:37,800
a CDs pays a dollar if some,
uh,

872
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:42,760
bond defaults by a dollar. Okay.
So that isn't an Arrow security,

873
00:56:42,761 --> 00:56:46,720
because an arrow security's a much more
detailed thing. And Arrow security says,

874
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:48,970
I'll pay a dollar.
In state one,

875
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:53,950
an Arrow security says you get an apple
in state one, but stage one, remember,

876
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:56,770
is not described by a single firm.

877
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:59,560
State won the states of nature,

878
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:02,950
our total descriptions of everything
that could happen in the economy.

879
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:07,810
So an Arrow security really says, if
it stopped snowing in Siberia, if,

880
00:57:07,811 --> 00:57:12,520
uh, the, you know, uh, Khomeini
loses power in Iran. If,

881
00:57:12,521 --> 00:57:13,150
uh,

882
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:18,130
there's a favorable election
outcome and Afghanistan and uh, if,

883
00:57:18,131 --> 00:57:21,630
uh, Obama wins reelection, and if a,

884
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:25,720
the u s solves the energy problem,
then I'll give you a dollar. Okay.

885
00:57:25,721 --> 00:57:28,810
So the Arrow security list,
incredible number of contingent things,

886
00:57:28,811 --> 00:57:31,990
every contingency possible and says,
in that case, I'll give you a dollar.

887
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:35,800
A CDs says, if this thing
happens, I'll give you a dollar.

888
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,020
Whether or not Obama wins election,

889
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:41,500
whether or not America discovers
a new source of energy,

890
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:44,050
whether or not Afghanistan turns around,
you know,

891
00:57:44,051 --> 00:57:46,330
just as long as the bond defaults,
I'll give you a dollar.

892
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:49,000
So the CDS is an event contingent.

893
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:55,210
It's an event contingent, a lot
of event, contingent security.

894
00:57:55,211 --> 00:57:59,920
That's the cds and an Arrow security.
It's a much more finely specified thing.

895
00:57:59,921 --> 00:58:03,100
It's a state contingent. He, you say
everything that happens in the economy,

896
00:58:03,101 --> 00:58:05,200
so we'll never get to aero securities,

897
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,990
but cds looks like we're
on the way to them.

898
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:11,590
And these guys blundered
by thinking since CDs is,

899
00:58:11,591 --> 00:58:15,040
or on the way to aero securities,
we should have as many cds as,

900
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:16,960
and let people trade as
much as them as we can.

901
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:20,200
But we're going to get to that in the
last lecture about how all that was, uh,

902
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:24,460
you know how all this theory, what's
wrong with all the theory, but, okay,

903
00:58:24,461 --> 00:58:26,230
so any other questions before we,

904
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:34,480
okay, so let's, uh, let's now,

905
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:35,570
yeah,

906
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:38,330
make the change that
he suggested up there.

907
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:42,360
Let's now change the economy just
a little bit. Let's eliminate C.

908
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:46,100
Okay. So, uh, so let's just disappears.

909
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:52,160
So obviously now the total endowment
is very contingent. It's 200.

910
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:57,500
It's 280 and it's a, what is it? Four 40.

911
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:03,980
Okay, so we now, now what do we do?

912
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:06,290
So Beta owns B.

913
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:12,140
Okay. So now what's that
delivery I'm going to be,

914
00:59:12,141 --> 00:59:14,520
what do you think is going to happen?
So we're going to see,

915
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:16,790
we want to quantify this.
We want to give a beautiful,

916
00:59:16,791 --> 00:59:19,100
simple theory that's quantifiable,

917
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:23,060
but what do you anticipate
happening to one p two and p three

918
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:30,120
so everybody's going to say alpha.
She's going to say, look, my a is risky.

919
00:59:30,121 --> 00:59:32,010
I don't want to hold my risky thing.

920
00:59:32,011 --> 00:59:34,530
I want to start hedging and
trading these arrows securities.

921
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:38,670
So I get the same constant in every
state. Of course, Beta beat Beta,

922
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,220
who owns B,
he's going to do the same thing.

923
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,770
So they're both going to be
trying to trade Errol securities.

924
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,690
What's going to happen

925
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:49,560
you think?
Yes.

926
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,180
Yeah. There's no way
that they can, exactly.

927
00:59:57,181 --> 01:00:00,330
There's no way that each of
them can be perfectly hedged.

928
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:05,060
So no matter what they do, they're going
to be exposed to more risk and states,

929
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,470
you know,
state three is going to be a great state.

930
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:09,720
State one is going to be a terrible state.

931
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:13,830
So what do you think that means about
the prices? So there's no way to head.

932
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,380
Everybody can't be hedged.
And so in fact,

933
01:00:16,381 --> 01:00:19,500
what'll happen is nobody will be hedged.
Okay?

934
01:00:19,501 --> 01:00:24,501
Although Alpha will be who hates risk
more than Beta will be closer to hedged,

935
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:29,820
then Veda will be, um, so Beta, we'll end
up bearing more of the risk than alpha.

936
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:34,800
And what do you think will happen to the
prices of the Arrow securities relative

937
01:00:34,801 --> 01:00:35,850
to the probabilities?

938
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:38,743
Yes,

939
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:43,280
there won't be a constant ratio
of a quarter as we had before,

940
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:44,810
but can you be more specific?

941
01:00:58,910 --> 01:00:59,661
Exactly.

942
01:00:59,661 --> 01:01:03,890
So that's what's going to turn out because
everybody though the world is short

943
01:01:03,891 --> 01:01:07,700
of commodities and state one, there just
aren't many apples. That's the disaster.

944
01:01:07,701 --> 01:01:12,590
That's when we, we can't solve the energy
crisis. We're totally screwed. Okay?

945
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:17,090
People, everybody wants to
consume more in that state.

946
01:01:17,091 --> 01:01:19,130
Everyone's going to try and
hedge against that state.

947
01:01:19,131 --> 01:01:22,370
They're all going to be trying to
buy Arrow securities in that state,

948
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:25,790
which means that because there aren't as
many divides and just not enough apolis

949
01:01:25,791 --> 01:01:29,300
to go around the price of Arrow Securities
and state one is going to be high

950
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:33,860
relative to state three where everybody's,
you know, you, you know there's,

951
01:01:33,861 --> 01:01:35,450
there's plenty to go around there.

952
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:40,630
So she is going to sell some of her
Aa and get some B okay to diversify,

953
01:01:40,761 --> 01:01:44,750
but these got so good and state three
that all of a sudden she's not going to be

954
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:47,000
so worried about state three anymore,

955
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:50,390
but state one she's still going to be
worried about and there's nothing to be

956
01:01:50,391 --> 01:01:51,970
done about that.
So the price is going to have,

957
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:56,060
have to be very expensive and state one.
Okay, so all right, that's all blah,

958
01:01:56,061 --> 01:01:59,270
blah blah. Let's solve for
equilibrium and see what happens.

959
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:04,130
We can solve immediately.
Nothing's changed. The utility
functions are the same.

960
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,970
None of this changed. Okay, so
this board doesn't change at all.

961
01:02:07,971 --> 01:02:12,971
That's demand still depends on p zero p
one p two and p three but now we have to

962
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:15,560
be a little bit more
careful and state one.

963
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:20,830
So demand in every state is 600 minus
401 over gamma one equals endowment of

964
01:02:21,481 --> 01:02:23,040
Alpha plus a dominant Beta.

965
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:26,430
So in state one I'm going
to now change this to a one,

966
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:29,580
although it's my handwriting,
it looked like a one anyway.

967
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:32,280
What's the aggregate
endowment in State One?

968
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:37,330
Yeah, I agree. Getting downwind
and state one is a hunt.

969
01:02:37,331 --> 01:02:41,290
It's 200 this is a one now.
Okay,

970
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:46,030
let's 200 okay,
so that means p one over gamma one

971
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,840
equals one right?

972
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:57,880
Because 400 and 400 so let's one so
you're not discounting the first state at

973
01:02:58,661 --> 01:03:00,520
all.
You're looking at the probability of it.

974
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:05,230
But what if I go to p two over gamma
to the demand is going to be the same.

975
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,760
It's the price that's going to change to
make up for the fact that the supply is

976
01:03:09,761 --> 01:03:13,720
much different.
Namely maybe we want to 80

977
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:16,830
yeah.

978
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:21,020
Okay. So now if I subtract,
I get 400 to 80 minus,

979
01:03:21,021 --> 01:03:25,170
that is three 20 divided by 400
which looks like four fifths,

980
01:03:25,171 --> 01:03:30,120
maybe two three 20 over 400 okay.
It's four fifths.

981
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:36,390
Okay. And if I go to right, because
three 20 divided by 404 fifths.

982
01:03:36,391 --> 01:03:39,630
So peach over gamma twos for fifth,
they're not proportional anymore.

983
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:42,690
And then p three over a gamma three.

984
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:48,580
Okay?

985
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:52,540
Okay.
Equals now the outcome is um,

986
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:57,880
four 40
so if I subtract four 40 from this,

987
01:03:57,881 --> 01:04:01,810
I get one 60 divided by 400

988
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:05,303
what's that?

989
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,460
Two fifths.
Thank you.

990
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:12,550
P three p three over gamma
three equals two fifth.

991
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,470
Okay, so a prices turned
out to be quite different.

992
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:23,840
Now the reason why they're slightly
higher on average, of course,

993
01:04:23,841 --> 01:04:27,260
and they were before is because
there's less consumption in the future.

994
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:30,140
We suddenly made our
future much worse off.

995
01:04:30,141 --> 01:04:33,140
So people are more desperate
to consume in the future.

996
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:35,960
So that means the price is a future
consumption. I'm going to be higher.

997
01:04:35,961 --> 01:04:37,340
So we have two effects here.

998
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:40,940
These prices instead of being a
quarter everywhere are higher,

999
01:04:40,941 --> 01:04:43,760
much higher than a quarter because
the future will look so much worse.

1000
01:04:43,761 --> 01:04:46,760
The interest rate is going to go up.
It's going to go down.

1001
01:04:46,761 --> 01:04:48,590
It's not going to be 300% anymore.

1002
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:53,890
But more interesting is that the prices
are no longer proportional to the

1003
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:56,660
probabilities. Justice,
he said over there,

1004
01:04:56,930 --> 01:05:01,930
the price in state one is going to be
much higher relative to the probability,

1005
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:04,040
namely 100% of it.

1006
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:08,990
Then the price and state three
which is only 40% of it. Okay,

1007
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:13,970
so that's the conclusion.
So now what do we do for our price?

1008
01:05:13,971 --> 01:05:18,530
What's the price of a,
what's the price of a,

1009
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:22,920
what do I plug in here? That, okay,

1010
01:05:22,921 --> 01:05:27,921
so that equals one quarter times 50 plus

1011
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:34,590
four fifths times a quarter,
four fifths times a quarter,

1012
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:39,710
four fifths times a quarter or one fifth
times a hundred plus p three was a two

1013
01:05:43,261 --> 01:05:45,960
fifths times a half plus one fifth

1014
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:53,270
time 75 hey would equal
something 2035 and 12 and a half.

1015
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,010
47 and a half.

1016
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:04,790
Why did I what? Okay. So what is p won?

1017
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:08,630
He won is equal to gamma one.

1018
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:13,190
Gamma one is a quarter. So that's
how I got a quarter here. So that's,

1019
01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:16,610
that's one times a corner.
Hey,

1020
01:06:16,611 --> 01:06:19,500
P two was to fit was three fifths.

1021
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:22,640
Now what was p two maybe
I did it wrong anyway.

1022
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:26,390
He too was for fifth times a quarter

1023
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:29,810
times the corner.
Hey,

1024
01:06:29,811 --> 01:06:34,730
which is equal to one fifth and p
three was two fifths times a half.

1025
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:36,300
Okay.

1026
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:39,440
Okay. Which is equal to one fifth.
So that's how I got the prices. Okay,

1027
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:41,060
so all right.

1028
01:06:41,061 --> 01:06:45,110
So you see that things change and we've
captured the idea that people can't

1029
01:06:45,111 --> 01:06:49,160
hedge fully by making the price of the
oral security in the state where the

1030
01:06:49,161 --> 01:06:53,310
economy's worse off,
much smaller than it was

1031
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:57,550
before I go much higher than it was
relative to the probability then before.

1032
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:02,800
Okay. So, so we haven't gotten close
to the punch line. Sorry, I got,

1033
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:04,780
okay. So we're about, yes,

1034
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:09,960
we're much more than you.

1035
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,970
Okay.
So the prices,

1036
01:07:13,971 --> 01:07:17,240
the two things happen to the
prices compared to before.

1037
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:18,800
One is that we no longer have,

1038
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:21,620
the price is proportional to
the probabilities right there.

1039
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:25,340
The proportion is one, four fifths,
two fists instead of the same constant,

1040
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:26,300
a quarter everywhere.

1041
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:30,260
And that's because the relative scarcity
people are much more worried about the

1042
01:07:30,261 --> 01:07:34,040
first state, then the fourth state. And
that's why relative to the probability,

1043
01:07:34,041 --> 01:07:36,680
the prices much higher
than the third state.

1044
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:37,450
Okay.

1045
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:39,010
You Fall, you agree with that, right?

1046
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:40,200
Yeah.

1047
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,660
Okay. But there's a second effect,
which is that all these numbers,

1048
01:07:42,661 --> 01:07:45,540
one four fifths and two FIS,
they're bigger than the quarter,

1049
01:07:45,541 --> 01:07:48,120
quarter quarter we had before.
But that's obvious.

1050
01:07:48,121 --> 01:07:50,610
That's cause we wiped out the future,
you know,

1051
01:07:50,611 --> 01:07:52,860
the half the endowment in
the future disappeared.

1052
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:55,880
So naturally people are willing to pay
more for the future because they're poor

1053
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:58,560
there. That's what we do.
In the first day of class,

1054
01:07:58,561 --> 01:08:01,380
we said that the interest
rate or the third week,

1055
01:08:01,381 --> 01:08:05,880
the interest rate according to Fisher
would go down if you've got poor in the

1056
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:09,240
future. Okay. So that's part of the
reason that's happened. By the way.

1057
01:08:09,241 --> 01:08:11,040
What is the riskless rate of interest?

1058
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:16,370
So p one plus p Plus p three
equals now it's equal to um,

1059
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:24,620
a quarter plus a fifth was a fifth,
so a quarter plus a fifth plus a fifth.

1060
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:29,710
These are the prices a quarter plus a
fifth plus a fifth and that's equal to,

1061
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:32,960
okay,

1062
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:37,760
2010, 14 over 20 okay,

1063
01:08:37,761 --> 01:08:42,761
so that's five over seven over 10 so
therefore the interest rate one plus r

1064
01:08:42,861 --> 01:08:46,520
equals 10 over seven so r
equals three seven. Okay.

1065
01:08:46,521 --> 01:08:48,620
Which is like 40% okay,

1066
01:08:48,621 --> 01:08:53,621
so the interest rate went from 300% to
40% but that's because we lost all this

1067
01:08:54,141 --> 01:08:57,110
future consumption,
but that's not what I'm concentrating on.

1068
01:08:57,111 --> 01:08:58,700
Fisher would have already known that.

1069
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:03,020
What I'm concentrating on is the fact
that the prices are no longer proportional

1070
01:09:03,021 --> 01:09:06,380
to the probabilities. You, you're
discounting every probability,

1071
01:09:06,381 --> 01:09:09,410
but adjusting the probability because
people are much more worried about the

1072
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:10,820
first date.
Then the third stage.

1073
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:14,813
Yeah,

1074
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:18,180
not a, they're more worried about
the first state at the pain.

1075
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:21,280
The firms are a and B. The
states are one, two and three.

1076
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:25,210
So they're much more worried about the
first state where the payoff is 200 than

1077
01:09:25,211 --> 01:09:27,150
they are about the third
state with a payoff.

1078
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,620
Total dividends in the economy or four 40

1079
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:37,580
you with me?
Oh boy.

1080
01:09:38,410 --> 01:09:41,020
That sounded so unconvincing.
So let me just say like,

1081
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:42,230
I want to say the punch line.

1082
01:09:42,231 --> 01:09:46,010
So I've got three more minutes to go
there to punch lines, which are okay.

1083
01:09:46,011 --> 01:09:48,710
I haven't gotten to the
stunning conclusion so far.

1084
01:09:48,711 --> 01:09:51,700
I've said stuff which is um,
you know,

1085
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:53,870
which Arrow and debris
had already figured out.

1086
01:09:53,871 --> 01:09:57,740
But now I want to go to the thing that
Tobin and Marco, it's figured out okay.

1087
01:09:57,741 --> 01:10:00,230
Which is one more step
we haven't noticed yet.

1088
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:04,010
Arrow has already figured out that
because not everybody could hedge.

1089
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:05,980
That means that the,
the,

1090
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:10,580
the price of an Arrow security is
not exactly equal to the probability.

1091
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:13,580
It's relatively high
if the economy's poor,

1092
01:10:13,581 --> 01:10:16,010
like in state one and relatively lower.

1093
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:20,390
If the economy's rich like in state
three. Okay, that's common sense. Now,

1094
01:10:20,391 --> 01:10:24,710
what's not common sense is
the extraordinary conclusion
I'm about to show you.

1095
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:29,060
Let's look at what the consumption is,
the final consumption of this.

1096
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:31,760
Um,
these two people,

1097
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:39,590
okay. So if we look at the final
consumption of these two people,

1098
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:44,570
what's her final consumption? So
x a, okay. In the three states,

1099
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:48,860
it's 200 minus 100 times one.
Okay.

1100
01:10:48,861 --> 01:10:51,700
Which is a hundred. What is
it? In the second state? It's,

1101
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:55,670
it's 200 minus 100 times.

1102
01:10:55,671 --> 01:10:59,540
What was ps over times four fifths.
Okay.

1103
01:10:59,541 --> 01:11:03,680
Which is a help one 60 maybe.
Okay.

1104
01:11:03,681 --> 01:11:07,970
In the last it was 200 minus 100 times,
um,

1105
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:11,810
two fifths. Okay. Two fifths is 20.

1106
01:11:11,811 --> 01:11:14,820
So this is one 80 say that's hers.

1107
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:19,110
And his consumption in the future, I'll
put a twill, I haven't talked about x.

1108
01:11:19,111 --> 01:11:20,370
Zero yet.
Is,

1109
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:25,760
is a 400 minus 300 times one.

1110
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:26,731
Okay.

1111
01:11:26,731 --> 01:11:31,731
Which equals 100 and here it's
400 minus 300 times four fifths,

1112
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:33,781
okay?

1113
01:11:33,781 --> 01:11:38,781
Which is equal to help
four fifths of 300 160.

1114
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:41,513
Okay.

1115
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:46,550
And here it's 400 minus six no,

1116
01:11:46,951 --> 01:11:50,570
400 minus 300 times to fifth,

1117
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:55,970
which is equal to m one
22 to 80 is this right?

1118
01:11:58,170 --> 01:12:02,940
Hundred hundred 60 who told me
it was 160 yes. And what's that?

1119
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:06,450
Two fifths is one 20 this is two 80

1120
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:14,633
what?

1121
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:18,500
Which mistake is there?
Here?

1122
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:21,580
Second one.

1123
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,630
Which is this the wrong one
here?

1124
01:12:27,290 --> 01:12:31,880
Ford 200 minus 80 is one 20 thank you.
Okay,

1125
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:33,470
so these are all right now.

1126
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,393
Okay.

1127
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:39,730
One 80 you should be. Okay. This is,

1128
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:44,890
this is 40 so this should be one
60 thank you. That's it. Okay,

1129
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:45,790
great.
Okay,

1130
01:12:45,791 --> 01:12:49,090
so now what's so shocking about those
numbers that I finally got them right.

1131
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,850
Thank you. What's shocking is, uh,

1132
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:56,880
this consumption is just the
sum of the aggregate endowment.

1133
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:58,600
What's the aggregate and downwind

1134
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:05,520
whenever the aggregate endowment is
just one is just a 200 to 80 and four 40

1135
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:16,950
so let's say you take a quarter
of this. Okay? So the differences,

1136
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:21,350
let's take a quarter of that.
That's 50 70 okay,

1137
01:13:21,351 --> 01:13:26,150
that's 50 70 and one 10
okay,

1138
01:13:26,151 --> 01:13:30,770
so a quarter of this plus,
if you add to that one 50,

1139
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:32,990
you're going to get all these numbers.
So this person,

1140
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:37,040
Alpha a I claim just holds
150 of the riskless bond,

1141
01:13:37,041 --> 01:13:42,041
pays 150 150 plus 50 7,110 that's a no,

1142
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:47,560
is this the right?
Uh,

1143
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:51,333
okay.

1144
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:56,060
Just that's just check the number. Sorry.
Only one more second. I should have.

1145
01:13:58,450 --> 01:14:02,720
Okay,
so a hundred 120 and one 60,

1146
01:14:02,721 --> 01:14:03,860
that's the right number.

1147
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:08,880
And that's equal to 50
50 of the bond plus, um,

1148
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:13,350
a quarter of this thing.
So 50 50 is okay, quarter.

1149
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,760
This is 50 70 and one 10,
right?

1150
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:18,790
So if you hold 50 of the
bond plus a quarter of this,

1151
01:14:18,791 --> 01:14:23,791
you get 150 of the bond plus 70 is 100
2050 of the bond plus one 10 is one 60

1152
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:29,110
and this guy's going to hold three
quarters of the aggregate endowment,

1153
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:33,670
three quarters of the aggregate
endowment plus minus 50 the bond.

1154
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:37,840
So three quarters of a,
of the aggregate endowment,

1155
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,520
three quarters of this thing,

1156
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:44,230
three quarters of the aggregate endowment
is one 50 minus 50 is a hundred.

1157
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:49,500
Three quarters of this is to 10 minus 50
is one 63 quarters of that is three 30

1158
01:14:49,541 --> 01:14:51,160
minus 50 is to 80.

1159
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:55,030
So what they've done in
ACC Librium is everybody,

1160
01:14:55,031 --> 01:14:58,810
despite having a million stocks to choose
from and thousands of states and all

1161
01:14:58,811 --> 01:15:01,900
that stuff, what everybody
does is hold the restless bond,

1162
01:15:01,901 --> 01:15:06,470
puts money in the bank and holds the
whole stock market. So the first day,

1163
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:09,490
and we're going to improve next time,
it's called the mutual fund theorem,

1164
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:14,740
which is that everybody diversifies.

1165
01:15:15,490 --> 01:15:15,770
Okay?

1166
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:18,100
Every body diversifies.

1167
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:20,870
Okay.

1168
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:25,140
Hey, by holding, by holding, uh,

1169
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:28,790
uh, the, the aggregate economy,

1170
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:32,830
all stocks in the same
proportion plus money in bank.

1171
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:36,213
Yeah.

1172
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:40,840
Okay. So that fear of Shakespeare of
diversifying, what did it amount to do?

1173
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:42,370
We have a very concrete thing.

1174
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:47,550
You hold 10% this person's holding 50
25% of every stock in the whole economy,

1175
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:52,390
plus a lendings putting some money,
$50 in the bank.

1176
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:56,590
The other person is doing three quarters
of every stock in the whole economy

1177
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:58,510
plus lending the money
to the first person.

1178
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:01,030
So that's the first of the two
amazing results. And I'll like,

1179
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:04,330
I'll start next time by explaining
it. Okay. So you're going to see,

1180
01:16:04,331 --> 01:16:05,560
it's going to be very concrete.
