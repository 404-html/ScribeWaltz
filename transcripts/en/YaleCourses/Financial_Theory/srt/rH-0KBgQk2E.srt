1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:07,190
Last time we, uh, found out how
to, how to evaluate options,

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,460
especially stopping options where you
don't, you don't have so many options,

3
00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:13,610
either do something you don't do it.
This is the simplest kind of option.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,650
And we discovered through
two examples at least that,

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,090
uh, the option is worth
more than people realize.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,870
So this time we're going to apply that
and that the way to figure out exactly

7
00:00:26,871 --> 00:00:30,260
what it's worth and exactly what to do
is to, is to work by backward induction.

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,060
So we're,
we're going this time,

9
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:36,320
we're going to apply that reasoning to
the two most important options that a in

10
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:39,200
the economy.
One is callable bonds,

11
00:00:39,201 --> 00:00:43,250
and then a much more important
one is the mortgage option.

12
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,390
And you know,

13
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:47,690
all of you at some time in your lives
will probably own houses and have a

14
00:00:47,691 --> 00:00:50,960
mortgage option and have to think about
what kind of mortgage to get and what

15
00:00:50,961 --> 00:00:54,830
the option is. So I want to teach
you how to think about that problem.

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,760
So let's start with the
callable bond problem.

17
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,350
Oh, got to turn this on. Oh,

18
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,890
so let's start here with the
column will bond. Problem.

19
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,820
So callable bonds are issued
by corporations and they pay,

20
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,120
usually an interest rates say 9%.

21
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,420
So the bond pays 9%,
9%,

22
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:39,000
and then some years later it pays 109.

23
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:40,490
Okay.

24
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,600
But at, at any point in
time, you have the option,

25
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:49,601
the company has the option of
calling the bond and calling it for,

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,770
so it's going to pay nine plus a
hundred at the end. So here it's nine.

27
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,330
So at any time the company has
the option of calling the bond.

28
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,350
So what does that mean? It means after
it's paid the nine. So the bond, the,

29
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,780
the, the companies issued a bond
promising to pay nine for say, 10 years,

30
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,710
and then the principal and the 10th
year, this is year 10, the tall,

31
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,910
the total of 109. Okay. So that's
the simplest possible bond.

32
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,180
And the company
occasionally has the option.

33
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:24,050
We'll see in a minute why would want this
option has the option of saying, okay,

34
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,060
we don't want to make the
rest of those payments.

35
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:29,720
We want to get out of our promise.
We've just paid you nine,

36
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,080
we'll pay off the extra
hundred. Uh, you know,

37
00:02:33,081 --> 00:02:35,390
that we're eventually going to have
to, oh, and we'll call it a day.

38
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,190
So this is the payment.

39
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,210
Okay.

40
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,830
And this is the remaining balance.

41
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,263
Okay.

42
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,000
So for a a callable bond,
there's really it,

43
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,010
the remaining balance is always a hundred.

44
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,760
So it's pretty obvious that if you've
made an arrangement, so, and you know,

45
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,090
I owe you like for example,
the prototype called mortgage,

46
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,550
where was there exactly?
This kind, somebody borrows
money from you and they say,

47
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:08,551
I promise to pay you $9 a year until the
last year when I'm gonna pay you 109.

48
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:14,050
This is called for those old mortgages,
it was called the balloon payment. Okay.

49
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:18,040
But, uh, in, in chemical bonds, it's
just the principle payment, you know,

50
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,810
the hundred face value of the bond.

51
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,160
So the person who borrowed the money
in as agreed to pay off over the years,

52
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,740
he might have a reason why the house he
put up as collateral is no longer going

53
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,520
to be his house.
He might want to move,

54
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,960
in which case the lender doesn't have
a house anymore backing the loan.

55
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,980
And they have to, some have some way of
resolving the loan in ending it. Okay.

56
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:41,020
And so the question is,
after you've made a payment,

57
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,610
how can you resolve the rest of the loan,

58
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:44,470
which was supposed to go
on for six more years.

59
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,700
Will you just agree to pay a hundred
and then you call it quit. Okay.

60
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:52,450
So that's us. That's a, that's a
typical kind of bond. All right?

61
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:57,451
So a non callable bond is you've committed
to paying the $9 in the 109 at the

62
00:03:57,581 --> 00:03:59,710
end and you have no option
to get out of a thing.

63
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,350
So we want to study what the differences
in value between the non callable bond,

64
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:07,570
where you're obliged to pay
the whole thing until the end.

65
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,840
And the callable bond where you can
get out of it by paying a hundred.

66
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:15,430
And it's easy to see why a callable
bond might've been, uh, invented,

67
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:18,760
especially for a mortgage when you've got
this balloon payment because you know,

68
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:23,390
you might want to dissolve the debt,
but by,

69
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,120
by putting this option
to dissolve the debt,

70
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,150
you drastically change
the value of the promise.

71
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:31,760
And that's what we want to calculate,
how much that changes.

72
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,990
So why might it change? Well,
the interest rates might change.

73
00:04:35,991 --> 00:04:38,870
They might go up or down soon.

74
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:43,100
We're going to have them going up
or down in a more complicated way.

75
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,410
But suppose that the interest rate starts
somewhere like it's seven, you know,

76
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:53,240
8% maybe and it uh,
it could go up to some number.

77
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,560
Now I'm always going to do
a geometric random walk.

78
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,270
This has become very fashionable in
finance and you should be asking the

79
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:08,200
question, you know, does it is a special
that we're only have two possibilities?

80
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:10,570
I'm the world life has many
more than two possibilities.

81
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:13,840
Suppose we had hundreds of possibilities.
Would that make a difference?

82
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,940
The answers is not going
to make a difference,

83
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:19,450
but we're going to have to see why.
So in the geometric random walk,

84
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:23,710
literally the thing can go
up or down, um, each period.

85
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,650
So what does it go to if this is our zero,

86
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:31,830
the next period we say it goes to
our zero times e to the volatility,

87
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:36,400
which I usually call sigma.
Okay.

88
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:41,910
Plus maybe a drift plus d and here it's
going to go to r zero e let's write it a

89
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:46,750
little more room

90
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,470
are zero e to the sigma,

91
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:55,040
e to the minus sigma,
plus

92
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,320
minus plus d. Okay, so
what's happened here?

93
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:05,210
The interest rates started at 8% it gets
multiplied by e to the d which is just

94
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:09,410
a number. Okay, so it's maybe
tending to go up over time.

95
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:13,340
If DNS positive or if dia zero think of
d zero are zero on average it's going to

96
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:17,510
stay at our zero but there's
some uncertainty. Maybe
the interest rate goes up.

97
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:22,511
We multiply it by some number eight of
the sigma and then we multiplied by the

98
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:26,180
reciprocal of the same number,
we divide it by eight of the sigma.

99
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,540
So using the exponential notation just
makes the computations and the computer

100
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,490
easier because the
computer's adding numbers.

101
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,700
You know this thing over here is going
to be our zero e to the two sigma Plus d

102
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:45,250
plus to be right and
this will be our zero e.

103
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,740
This will just be our zero e to the two
D and this will be our zero e to the

104
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:53,270
minus two sigma plus two.

105
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:59,140
So the computer in calculating the
interest rate at every step is adding

106
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:03,110
exponents and it makes the calculation
when you're doing gazillions of nodes

107
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,990
much faster.
So that's why we use this.

108
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,930
It's a traditional to use this notation,

109
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:13,340
but really all I'm saying is you multiply
or divide by the same number to see

110
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:14,690
what the next interest rate is.

111
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,470
And on top of that you might be sort of
increasing all the things over time just

112
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,180
because you think the interest
rates are going over time.

113
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:24,350
So that's how we're modeling uncertainty
and everybody's supposed to understand

114
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,030
what the probabilities are of these moves.
Okay.

115
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:32,870
So for now that's going to be our model
of uncertainty and in a few minutes I'm

116
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:37,670
going to try and indicate why complicating
it won't have much effect. Okay.

117
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:41,810
So there are any questions. This
notation I hope isn't too complicated.

118
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:43,760
Are there any questions about
the interest rate process?

119
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:46,190
I'm assuming the uncertainty
that people are facing. Yeah,

120
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,143
why is that?

121
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,761
Okay.

122
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:57,760
Cause I'm assuming that if there weren't
uncertainty the interest rate was going

123
00:07:57,761 --> 00:08:02,400
to keep steadily rising by multiplying
by the constant e to the B.

124
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,360
So here I have multiplied it by eight
of the d here on multiplying it again by

125
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,950
either the B I'm going to
multiply it again by eating the d.

126
00:08:08,951 --> 00:08:11,190
So d is a 10th of a percent.

127
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:16,170
It means that the interest rate is rising
at a 10th of a percent every period.

128
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,170
And you know you might just think interest
rates are going to get higher in the

129
00:08:19,171 --> 00:08:19,890
future.

130
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,340
You might have a more complicated
function than steadily rising are steadily

131
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:24,060
falling.

132
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,510
It's just that this is the simplest t
to add a little complication without

133
00:08:27,511 --> 00:08:28,770
making it too complicated,

134
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,920
steadily rising are steadily falling and
binomial uncertainty with the easiest

135
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,520
simple things I could do.
Of course a more realistic thing.

136
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,570
We do more complicated things.
Any other questions about what this means?

137
00:08:42,571 --> 00:08:44,400
I know this can be confusing,
this notation,

138
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:45,990
so let's just figure out the notation.

139
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,340
Make sure you understand it before I
move on cause it's really nothing but

140
00:08:50,341 --> 00:08:53,640
notation. I'm just saying the
interest rate is, you know, 8% today.

141
00:08:53,641 --> 00:08:57,080
It can go up a little or down
little, uh, and then you know,

142
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,590
after that it can go up or down and the
percentage rise and fall is always going

143
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:04,830
to be the same relative to adrift
and the Drift might be zero.

144
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:09,170
The drift might be positive.
Okay, so to take it again,

145
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,023
example,

146
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,760
let's take an example here.

147
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,390
Okay, so this is a plug, everything in?

148
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:26,560
Yes. This is a spreadsheet that
you have called callable bond.

149
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,010
I did a little work on it,
but not much.

150
00:09:31,011 --> 00:09:35,940
It's basically your spreadsheet.
Everything's plugged in here.

151
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,100
Sing that. Right. Okay. So
what I've done is I've said,

152
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,750
let's take over here the year.
So here are the years, you know,

153
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,990
zero one, two, three blah
blah, up to 31 or something.

154
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:53,350
Then the bond coupon rate is 9% so the
bond is going to pay $9 9% of the face is

155
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:58,810
always 100 we'll pay $9 till the end.
So if you look at,

156
00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:01,850
if I take the bond
maturity of 30 down here,

157
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:06,140
I've got the $9 payments and
I've got the remaining principal,

158
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:09,470
the remaining balance,
what you can pay to dissolve the contract.

159
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,150
You could after the first year,

160
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:14,120
after paying nine immediately afterwards
you could pay a hundred and say forget

161
00:10:14,121 --> 00:10:17,120
about the whole thing. Okay?
So that's, that's that.

162
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:20,570
And so it goes all the way
to year 30 and searing youth,

163
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,600
your 30th see you're paying 109 and then
then the bond is over 109 and by then

164
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:31,430
the bond is over. There's
nothing to talk about. Okay?

165
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:35,990
So now I start off the interest rates.
Some are at 8% okay?

166
00:10:35,991 --> 00:10:39,170
And I take the volatility,
it's always said in hundreds.

167
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:44,171
I think the volatility is 16 that means
sigma equals 16 over a hundred cause

168
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,910
that's the way people talk
about volatility of 16% so
that is a sort of standard

169
00:10:50,361 --> 00:10:50,991
volatility.

170
00:10:50,991 --> 00:10:55,991
12 or 16% is about the annual volatility
of these things traditionally.

171
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,070
So I've taken the volatility at 16% so
I take the drift to zero to make that

172
00:11:01,071 --> 00:11:05,720
simple. The DS disappearing.
Okay? So what does that mean?

173
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:10,250
It means that whatever the thing was
last period when it moves to here,

174
00:11:10,251 --> 00:11:14,690
I take the old number. Okay? At
the top there, if you read this,

175
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,540
I'm taking,
this is the up multiplier.

176
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:22,220
I just take of the signal plus d
and that's what this says over here.

177
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,240
Exponent of, you know, just as that, okay,

178
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:30,860
so that's the Apollo supplier and that's
the download multipliers. So then, okay,

179
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:35,570
and so let's just see how that looks.
So if I look at the interest rates,

180
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:40,130
I started 8%
and they can go up,

181
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:44,570
you know, by that
multiplier, 16% up, 16% down.

182
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,660
And see if we take 8% you add 16% too.

183
00:11:47,661 --> 00:11:51,950
It's slightly more than 16% because
either the 0.16 is a little bit more than

184
00:11:51,951 --> 00:11:56,951
16% you think 16 for eight 16% off
is about 9.3% interest and 16% down,

185
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:02,470
you go from 8% to 6.8% and
things just go up or down.

186
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,890
So that's the uncertainty. Okay?
So that's the, that's the, uh,

187
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,450
that's what interest
rates are going to do.

188
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:12,280
So everybody knows that you started at
8% and interest rates can go up or down

189
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:14,650
by 16% for the next 30 years.

190
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:19,090
The question is what's the value of the
bond? Well, if you couldn't call it,

191
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,620
okay, you're, please interrupt
me if you're not following.

192
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:28,000
If he couldn't call it non callable bond,
the,

193
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,500
the why would you expect it to
have such a high price? Well,

194
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:37,150
because the interest rate, you know,
is, sorry, the interest rate remember,

195
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,890
is only 8% and on average it's going
to stay at 8% it could go up or down,

196
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:44,020
but you know, it's always
coming back. The middle,

197
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,830
the middle thing there is always
8% so if you look in the middle,

198
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:52,900
it's 8% 8% 8% 8% so sort of the geometric
average is 8% on average it's going to

199
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:56,050
be 8% that's less than the payment nine.

200
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:00,940
So the poor bondholder is overpaying
paying nine every year when the interest

201
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:05,560
rates only 8% and on average is
going to be 8% so obviously the, the,

202
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:10,270
the bond issuer is giving a very good
deal to the buyer by paying nine when the

203
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:14,710
interest rates only 8% and you know
how you calculate this at every step,

204
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:18,730
you'd have to do it by backward
induction. So you'd write down, uh,

205
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:22,120
and we've done this before,
the value at every node.

206
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,380
V S okay.
So if I take a note here,

207
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,480
what's the value of it? The value
of it. So, so what's the value?

208
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,740
So I could do a con, okay. I don't know
if I need to do a concrete example. If I,

209
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,310
how do I do this by backward induction?
So I keep going like that,

210
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,880
right? And then the, the
life is going to end.

211
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,900
This is the last payment somewhere.
Let's say the last payment is here.

212
00:13:48,901 --> 00:13:53,901
So you're going to get a hundred 909
no matter what because that's where the

213
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,890
life,
that's the last period.

214
00:13:55,891 --> 00:14:00,891
100900900 nine 109 okay,

215
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:05,200
so we know what the value is here.
Uh,

216
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,730
at the end is zero beyond this point.
So the question is,

217
00:14:08,731 --> 00:14:11,360
and we know what the value is here,
you just take the inch,

218
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,380
you know going to pay 109 no matter what.

219
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,930
So you just take the interest
rate back here. Okay?

220
00:14:15,931 --> 00:14:17,190
So we know what the value is here.

221
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:20,730
So the question is if you figured
out the value at the end of the tree,

222
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,280
which is trivial because the
last page at the very end,

223
00:14:23,281 --> 00:14:24,930
you're just going to get 109 for sure.

224
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,630
Can you figure out what the value
is at the beginning of the tree?

225
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,740
And the way you do that is for
every node you say to yourself,

226
00:14:30,741 --> 00:14:34,080
it doesn't matter which node you are,
like this one or that one,

227
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,720
let's call it note s.
Okay?

228
00:14:36,721 --> 00:14:39,930
So the value of note s this is the value

229
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:46,230
just after paying the coupon.

230
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,680
Okay? So you've paid the coupon, you
paid the nine. Now what's the value?

231
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,980
Well the non call price.
So what's do non call

232
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,260
non call bond.
What is the value going to be?

233
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,720
Well just after paying the nine here,
what's the value of what's left?

234
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,790
Well half the time, so you're going
to have to go up here. So half that.

235
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,410
So first of all you're going to
discount by the interest rate here.

236
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:23,411
So it's one over one plus r s so you're
discounting by the interest rate there.

237
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,280
Then half the time you're
going to have to, um,

238
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:32,900
you'll go up. Okay. And so what
we have to do, if you go up,

239
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:37,930
you'll have to pay nine because that's
the required payment and then you'll be

240
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:42,230
left in the same situation except that
you'll be at the upstage or whatever the

241
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:46,520
value is there plus the s up.

242
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,860
If this note is asked, this node, we call
s up and this snowed, we call s down.

243
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,310
So if you knew,
so I'm doing this by backward induction.

244
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:59,930
Remember I'm saying suppose towards the
end of the tree I figured out what is

245
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:03,070
the value of the bond just after
making the coupon payments,

246
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,590
since there are no coupon payments at
the end. I know the value of zero. Okay,

247
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:11,120
so having done it at the end and working
my way backwards now by induction,

248
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,610
I can figure out the value
at any previous notes.

249
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:18,200
So suppose I'm here and I've already
figured out the value of all future nodes.

250
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:23,380
The value here is simply going to be value
here is just after the coupon payment

251
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,630
is going to be, I'm going to
discount it, the interest rate here,

252
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:30,130
one plus r s half the time I'm going
to have to go up here with Jason,

253
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,620
I'm going to pay nine and
then what am I going to do?

254
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,920
I'm going to be at a situation and I've
just made the coupon payment and I've

255
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,890
see what the value left is. Well that's
the number you already calculated.

256
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:44,540
So vs up plus one half.
If I go down,

257
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:48,310
I'm down to here,
it's nine again plus vsts.

258
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,100
So I mean that's pretty simple.
Okay.

259
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:54,620
And now I just have to solve
it by backward induction.

260
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,510
So that's what I did in this tree. Here's
the interest rates. And now back here,

261
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,100
here's the present value of a non
callable bonds. So at any node,

262
00:17:03,101 --> 00:17:06,080
let's pick one like this one.
What's the value?

263
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:11,470
It says it's one over one plus the
interest rate times the probability p 0.5

264
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:14,720
that's a half times the payment.

265
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:17,780
That's $9 plus what the
value would be if I went up.

266
00:17:17,781 --> 00:17:22,610
Cause Jay one 49 is, is
this, no, that's Jay.

267
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,220
That's Jay one 49 here.
So it's just exactly what I wrote.

268
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:32,210
Half 50% probability j
four is the $9 at the top,

269
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,920
plus the probability,

270
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:38,950
the plus the value of what I would get
here plus a half times the same $9 if I,

271
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,730
I'd have to pay if I went down plus
the value that I'd get down here.

272
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:48,110
So that's an extremely simple
calculation to do. And because Xcel,

273
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,260
you know, is a brilliant,
as I say, I'm created by uh,

274
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:56,250
Kapore the whose sister was my classmate
and it was two years ahead of me at

275
00:17:56,251 --> 00:17:59,910
Yale. You know, Excel immediately
understands, he called the Lotus,

276
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,330
immediately understands that a,
if you give all these directions,

277
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:06,750
he can't figure out the value here unless
you know what the value was forward.

278
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,460
So Xcel understands that you should keep
going forward and starting at the end

279
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,760
and at the end it knows what the
value is because it's to zero.

280
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,980
So having got the value zero at the end,

281
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:20,340
it then works backwards all the way
through the tree and gets the value at the

282
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:24,540
beginning. He gets it 113 so
it's exactly what we want to do.

283
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:28,800
And he's just written this brilliant
program that understands, you know,

284
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:32,520
if there's a dependency,
you can't calculate this
without knowing this. He says,

285
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:33,630
okay,
I don't know this.

286
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,330
I'll go forward in the program
to hear I can't do these either.

287
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,820
I'll go all the way to the end.
Now everything's zero.

288
00:18:38,821 --> 00:18:41,220
So I know all these
numbers now step by step,

289
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,840
I can go backwards and get all of them.

290
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,870
That's what Xcel is doing and
it does it instantly. Okay?

291
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:50,730
So there's no doubt about that, right?
You all are way ahead of me on that. Okay,

292
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:53,550
so the is 113 that's a huge number.

293
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,520
So obviously it's a very generous company.

294
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,940
The company may not want to be so
generous. So the company says, look,

295
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,570
we want maybe to,
uh,

296
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,940
we want to be able to call the
bond at a hundred. Okay. And, uh,

297
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,240
now with the w, so that's simple
option. What's it going to be?

298
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,430
What's the value going to be?
Well,

299
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:18,240
obviously the company could call her
right away at a hundred so it's going to

300
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:23,100
make the value go all the way down to 100
because the company now has the option

301
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:27,660
whenever it wants to, like at the very
beginning before making the first payment,

302
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,640
it could pay a hundred here.
Okay.

303
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:33,660
Or it could pay the $9 and then pay
a hundred here. So the question is,

304
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:38,040
should the company do it and when do
you think the company will exercise the

305
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:38,874
option?

306
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:40,950
Okay.

307
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:45,120
Why would the company, why wouldn't the
company exercise the option right away?

308
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:46,861
So here it is,

309
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:51,861
the bonds worth 113 every period
the is promising to pay $9.

310
00:19:52,051 --> 00:19:55,130
That's like a 9% interest.
The interest rates in the economy,

311
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,010
only 8% at the beginning here.
So it's losing money right from the start.

312
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:03,150
Why shouldn't the company just say, okay,
you know, we gave ourselves the option.

313
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:04,170
We're taking it right away.

314
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:06,720
We're going to just pay you a hundred
and cancel the whole thing at the

315
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:11,060
beginning. Why wouldn't
they do that? Okay,

316
00:20:11,061 --> 00:20:13,550
well hang on for one second. Someone
else, why wouldn't they do that?

317
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,950
See, the puzzle is the company can
pay his promise to pay $9 forever.

318
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:28,500
That's like 9% on the
hundred dollar coupon.

319
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:33,060
The interest rate is only 8% now,
so the company's paying more money,

320
00:20:33,061 --> 00:20:37,860
$9 then you know it could have borrowed
and only had to pay $8 so the guy buying

321
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,570
it is getting this who'd huge bonus.

322
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,600
He's getting $9 coupons
instead of $8 coupons.

323
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,500
He's probably telling his friends, you
know, who aren't marking to market.

324
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:49,720
Look at my return.
I've got $9 as until the first year.

325
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,840
Look at that great 9% return I got
in my investment of 100 why is uh,

326
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,000
why won't the company call
it right at the beginning?

327
00:20:58,001 --> 00:21:00,850
What's the company waiting for?

328
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:07,620
Yup.
Back Up.

329
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,970
Exactly.
Because if the interest rates go way up,

330
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,150
then the company, maybe the
interest rates, you know,

331
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:18,630
not after a very short amount of time,
if the company gets lucky,

332
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,800
the interest rates are gonna go up. So
here, here are the interest rates, right?

333
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:27,030
So after a very short amount of time,
you know, two years you get the up thing,

334
00:21:27,031 --> 00:21:31,020
the interest rates are 11% so all of
a sudden the company's looking great.

335
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:35,820
It's borrowed at 9% and it's
a only having to, you know,

336
00:21:35,821 --> 00:21:38,970
and the interest rates are
actually 11% so that, so,

337
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:44,510
um, you know, every time you know,
effectively it's borrowing from the,

338
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:49,490
from the guy 9% and it's able to invest
the money at 11% to put it another way,

339
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:54,200
the present value of the payments left
from then are much less than a hundred so

340
00:21:54,201 --> 00:21:57,080
it's glad it made the deal.
And on the other hand,

341
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:00,140
if the interest rate goes down far enough,
okay,

342
00:22:00,141 --> 00:22:04,100
then the company will be able to call
the thing present value of the payments.

343
00:22:04,101 --> 00:22:06,530
If it couldn't call,
would be way higher,

344
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,730
but because it can call it can never
do suffer worse than having to pay a

345
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:11,960
hundred.
Okay.

346
00:22:11,961 --> 00:22:15,230
So you see that it's the interest rates
are going up or down and he couldn't

347
00:22:15,231 --> 00:22:19,550
call it. Okay. Then it's a,
and you couldn't call it.

348
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,870
Okay. Then when interest rates go up,
that's really good news for the company.

349
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:29,090
Okay. Because now the interest rates
are over 9% on average going forward.

350
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,060
So actually the Wa the present
value of payments is 98.

351
00:22:32,061 --> 00:22:36,530
That's less than a hundred. On the
other hand, if interest rates go down,

352
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,730
then the company's really screwed. Now
the present value of what it owes is 127.

353
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,610
Okay.
And at the beginning it's 113.

354
00:22:43,611 --> 00:22:45,800
So as interest rates go
further and further down,

355
00:22:45,801 --> 00:22:48,200
the company's made a worse
and worse bond issue.

356
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,870
But it doesn't suffer
very much because of that,

357
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:54,590
because it can always get out of
it's deal by calling it. Okay.

358
00:22:54,591 --> 00:22:59,420
So in fact, astonishingly, um,

359
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:03,430
it doesn't even call the first
time. So here, here's the OP,

360
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:06,680
here's the value and the,
when the company behaves optimally,

361
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,640
it won't call the first time when
interest rates go up, it says a high,

362
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:13,760
we're going to make money. That's
great. But when interest rates go down,

363
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,260
we just saw that that's, that's, you know,

364
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:18,020
now the interest rates 6%
and it's still paying nine.

365
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,270
The company's still not
going to call the bond.

366
00:23:20,271 --> 00:23:24,800
It won't call the bond till the interest
rates go down all the way to 5%. Okay.

367
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,390
So anyway,
by backward induction,

368
00:23:26,391 --> 00:23:31,310
you get the value of the
callable bond is 95 which is um,

369
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,980
95.5 to nine, which is a lot. Uh,

370
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:41,840
so let's, let's do, let's write those
down. In fact, Sovi callable bond

371
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:53,880
95.5 to nine.

372
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,730
Okay.
A non call.

373
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:01,983
Okay.

374
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,980
Was 113 point something
which I forgot already.

375
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,400
MMM.

376
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:10,611
Okay.

377
00:24:10,611 --> 00:24:14,120
So I hope you're falling cause it's going
to get a lot more surprising when we

378
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,310
do mortgages,
but it's the same logic.

379
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:20,690
One 13.2361 13.236.

380
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,790
Okay, so the call option
is worth 18% of the bond.

381
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:29,290
It's a huge thing. It sounds so simple.
Of course you should get out of the,

382
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,163
a lot of the,

383
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,890
you should dissolve the thing for a value
of a hundred that's the only natural

384
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:34,724
thing to do.

385
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:39,140
So it's perfectly reasonable you would
think for the company to give itself that

386
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:42,470
option. Look guys, we're borrowing
money, but there may be some reason why,

387
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,810
you know, things get too
complicated. We can, you know,

388
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:47,690
our company might close down.
We want to keep our promise,

389
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:51,590
so he just want to pay off the loan
at a hundred so give us that option.

390
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:53,960
Even if our company
doesn't close down well,

391
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:57,800
the company has just taken an
incredibly valuable option.

392
00:24:57,801 --> 00:25:02,801
Instead of making a promise worth 113
it's made a promise worth 95 okay.

393
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,740
Now before I move,
so any questions about that?

394
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:09,710
You could all get that and you all see
why that's happening and it's a bigger

395
00:25:09,711 --> 00:25:11,060
number than you'd expect.
Yup.

396
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,483
Okay.

397
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,420
When should they call it?
Okay. They should call it.

398
00:25:15,421 --> 00:25:20,421
You can tell when they should call it
because you'll know when they call it.

399
00:25:20,491 --> 00:25:22,830
Because if they do call it,
what's the value?

400
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:31,150
Okay, so I, I didn't, I
didn't work out the, the, the,
what's the backward induction?

401
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,060
Oh, sorry. So let's write down
the formula when you do call it,

402
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,610
how could I have forgotten to do that?
So what do you do?

403
00:25:36,611 --> 00:25:39,700
What when you do call it,
so value,

404
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:45,560
how do you figure this out? I just skip
this. Sorry. Value of callable bond.

405
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,740
Yeah.

406
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,650
Okay.
So vs what is that going to equal?

407
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,220
Now you've got an option.
Okay.

408
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,700
Just after making the vs this is,

409
00:25:58,701 --> 00:26:02,240
remember this is a value just after

410
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,890
coupon payment.

411
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,870
Okay. So what is the value?
Just after the coupon payment,

412
00:26:13,871 --> 00:26:15,940
that's when you have to call in a second.

413
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:18,700
You'll see why that's the
way the rule works. Okay.

414
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:23,260
So the just after the coupon payment,
what's the value of the bond? Well,

415
00:26:23,261 --> 00:26:24,730
now that you have the option,

416
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,630
you can pay the minimum
of the remaining balance.

417
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:30,900
Okay.

418
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,990
Okay. So if it's a time,
it's a hundred all the time.

419
00:26:33,991 --> 00:26:38,160
This is just going to be a hundred you
could pay a hundred or you could keep

420
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:39,870
going.
So if you keep going,

421
00:26:39,871 --> 00:26:44,850
it's going to be one plus r s
times the same thing a half.

422
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,090
And then you're going to have to make
the coupon payment the next, you know,

423
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,030
up you'll go. You know you're,
you're, you're going to,

424
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,720
so just a

425
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,680
second. Where should we go? So here, this
is the interest rate. So at any node,

426
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:02,230
you know, you can pick any one like
here in the tree, this one, okay,

427
00:27:02,231 --> 00:27:06,430
that's the interest rate. So at that
node, you could, if you wanted to,

428
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,880
after making the coupon payment there,
you could pay the hundred and say, okay,

429
00:27:09,881 --> 00:27:12,250
we've made the payment,
I'm making a hundred more,

430
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:15,580
let's just call the whole thing quits.
But if you don't,

431
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,790
then something you're going to move on.
And when you're going to move on,

432
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:22,330
you're going to go either up to here.
Okay?

433
00:27:22,331 --> 00:27:25,510
So that's what the probability a half,
you have to make the coupon payment.

434
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:28,960
And then again,
you'll have the option of a,

435
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:34,610
you know, paying your way out of it.
Dissolving the contract or continuing.

436
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:38,450
So you just have VSU because
that's exactly the value.

437
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,860
Just after making the coupon
payment at node Su. Okay,

438
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,760
that's VSU and so it's going to take
into account that you're minimizing

439
00:27:46,761 --> 00:27:51,260
something. So you see vs the value
in any node takes into account.

440
00:27:51,261 --> 00:27:56,261
You could minimize by possibly paying the
balance and dissolving it or you could

441
00:27:56,481 --> 00:27:59,240
continue.
And so if you continue and things go up,

442
00:27:59,241 --> 00:28:01,640
you have to make the coupon and
then you're going to face a choice.

443
00:28:01,641 --> 00:28:04,970
But we assume by backward induction you've
already figured out the value of that

444
00:28:04,971 --> 00:28:06,380
thing.
Maybe it's paying the hundred,

445
00:28:06,381 --> 00:28:11,381
maybe it's not paying the hundred whatever
that is plus a half times nine plus

446
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,430
VSD.

447
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,090
Okay.

448
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,880
So the only difference
between this callable,

449
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:23,881
non call case and the call case is you
notice that the second term is exactly

450
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:26,140
the same in the two cases.

451
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:30,000
But here we've added the minimum of a
hundred in that cause you either can

452
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:31,720
continue or you could pay a hundred.

453
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:37,020
Of course the values vsq appear and vas
are not the same as the VSS here because

454
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,120
they've all been concatenated by
taking the minimum with a hundred. So,

455
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,760
um, okay. So how can you,

456
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,960
so the computer now is going to solve
this by backward induction and now how can

457
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,180
you tell what the
computer's decided to do?

458
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:56,200
Well you look at if the computer
said it's a good time to call,

459
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,191
that means it's going to,

460
00:28:57,191 --> 00:29:00,640
the value at that point is going to be a
hundred cause it's called by paying the

461
00:29:00,641 --> 00:29:05,140
remaining balance, which is a
hundred. So if you go now to the, um,

462
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,470
if you go to the present
value of non call,

463
00:29:08,471 --> 00:29:11,500
you get all these present values you
known as the interest rate goes down,

464
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:13,930
you get crushed. Okay. Of course,

465
00:29:13,931 --> 00:29:16,690
because you have the same
payments and lower interest rates,

466
00:29:16,691 --> 00:29:21,010
you're discounting buy less. But the
callable bond, so you shouldn't call here,

467
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:26,011
it's 99.9 so that means when the guy in
the computer took the minimum a hundred

468
00:29:26,081 --> 00:29:28,270
and this thing, it took
this, which was 99,

469
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:32,650
it didn't use the option to call at a
hundred but if things go down again,

470
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,390
then it's going to call it a hundred

471
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,433
okay?

472
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:42,010
So it's got a threshold here where the
interest rate has to go pretty far before

473
00:29:42,011 --> 00:29:46,090
it calls at a hundred okay?
It has to go down twice.

474
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,120
But you notice this
threshold as time goes on,

475
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,910
the threshold is going to get a tighter.

476
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:56,200
So even if you're at the same interest
rate for years, you know, this is a one,

477
00:29:56,201 --> 00:29:59,080
two, three, four, this is
five years later, okay?

478
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:03,010
When the interest rate's gone down
once below the minimum bar here,

479
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:08,260
five years later, you will call when
the interest rate is, you know, uh,

480
00:30:08,261 --> 00:30:13,261
instead of 8% to 6.8% but one year
later he won't call if it's 6.8%.

481
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,560
And why is that? Because at
this, no, well why is that?

482
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:20,380
How come if in the first year
the interest rate went from,

483
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:25,450
remember it started at 8% and it goes
down to 6.8% here you don't call on the

484
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:29,740
other hand, if things had gone, you know,

485
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:34,741
stayed the same for a few years and then
in year five or year or whatever this

486
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,720
year us, how many years have
we got here? One, two, three.

487
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:42,910
No year zero one, two, three,
four. So if a year for the,

488
00:30:42,911 --> 00:30:46,630
um, the interest rate
goes down to a year five,

489
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,500
the interest rate goes down
to 6.8%. Okay. And you're one,

490
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:54,430
if the interest rate went down
from 8% to 6.8%, you wouldn't call.

491
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,480
But if the interest rates sort of bounces
around and in the near five is backed

492
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:02,410
down at 6.8% you will call,
why would you call here?

493
00:31:02,411 --> 00:31:05,440
Even though in the exactly the same
situation, you didn't call here,

494
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,540
why call here and not here.

495
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:11,590
You can tell what you call cause those
are a hundreds and the computer's pick

496
00:31:11,591 --> 00:31:16,591
the minimum equal to 100 so why is it
that it's going to call here but not here

497
00:31:18,671 --> 00:31:22,510
even though the interest rates are
exactly the same, 6.8% in both cases.

498
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,063
Yes.

499
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,423
Yeah,

500
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:33,810
exactly. So the point is the only
reason not to call here, you're getting,

501
00:31:33,811 --> 00:31:35,610
you're paying through the nose,
it's horrible.

502
00:31:35,611 --> 00:31:39,870
The interest rate 6% you're paying
nine, it's terrible. But you're hoping,

503
00:31:39,871 --> 00:31:41,730
you know maybe things
are going to turn around,

504
00:31:41,731 --> 00:31:45,030
the interest rate's going to soar,
then it's going to be a great deal for me.

505
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:50,060
So I'm willing to have some short run
losses in case I get a gigantic gain on

506
00:31:50,401 --> 00:31:51,234
the upside.

507
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:54,540
And I know that I'm protected on the
downside because of things go down again,

508
00:31:54,541 --> 00:31:57,300
I can cut my losses and
just call it a hundred okay.

509
00:31:57,301 --> 00:32:00,780
But if you run out of time and things
are still here, the interest rate,

510
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:05,790
6.8 is still way below a 9% which is the
coupon you're paying and you don't have

511
00:32:07,531 --> 00:32:09,660
much time for the interest
rates to go back up.

512
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,780
You better call ven and cut
your losses. Exactly. So, okay,

513
00:32:12,781 --> 00:32:16,810
so that's the whole logic of the thing.
So any questions about that? And it's a,

514
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:20,160
as I said,
the options worth much more than it seems.

515
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,383
Okay.

516
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,560
Could you all do a problem like this?

517
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:32,550
You'll find out.
Okay.

518
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:39,140
All right. So now let me just do
one more example. Suppose, okay,

519
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:42,110
so now I want to say I
want to do an aside here.

520
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:46,670
Suppose that we had a trinomial
tree instead of a binomial tree.

521
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:53,120
Okay. So I have the same picture, but
instead of three to two things happening,

522
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:57,620
I say three things could happen
or five things could happen. Okay.

523
00:32:57,621 --> 00:33:02,060
Now how would I create? So
I would, I would take the
same tree and put this here,

524
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:06,680
you know, and I, I'd always allow for
something happening in the middle. Okay.

525
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:10,040
And then of course it gets
more complicated and I'm
gonna be able to draw it

526
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:14,140
because now this thing, three things
could happen from here and from here,

527
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:17,280
three things could happen from
here. You know, I have three things.

528
00:33:17,281 --> 00:33:20,330
So I have a trinomial tree like that,
right?

529
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:24,620
We're always three things could happen.
So from here I could go here,

530
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:29,480
stay the same, or go up. Okay.
Now, if I had a trinomial tree,

531
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:32,000
and of course you could think of an end,
no meal tree,

532
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,880
would I keep the same numbers here?
Well,

533
00:33:34,881 --> 00:33:37,940
I can't keep the same numbers
because if I have a half and a half,

534
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:40,280
that doesn't allow any probability
for going in the middle.

535
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,790
So I'll put a quarter here and a quarter.

536
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:50,540
Okay, now what do I have to do to
these numbers? Well, the drift,

537
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:53,930
I'm going to leave the same because on
average it's still going to go up by D.

538
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,810
Okay? So this was, remember
ours, your e to the minus sigma,

539
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,890
plus D. Okay. Do I want
to, but the s you know,

540
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:08,210
so this is a probability a half. Okay.
I just made up three numbers a quarter,

541
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:11,050
quarter and a half, or the
trinomial tree. Suppose those,

542
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,860
suppose those are my numbers.

543
00:34:12,861 --> 00:34:16,340
If I want to make this tree
comparable to the binomial tree,

544
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,710
what does it mean to be comparable?

545
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:23,890
It means that the standard deviation
and the expectation of the interest rate

546
00:34:25,581 --> 00:34:29,510
ought to be the same. Okay. So, um,

547
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,680
so I'm using the fact that if they're
normally distributed random variables,

548
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:36,050
all I need to know.
So if there were mill,

549
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:40,820
if there were millions of successor
interest rates and I took them with this,

550
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:45,560
uh, then there are millions of
these successor interest rates,

551
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:50,030
then as long as the standard deviation
and the expectation were the same,

552
00:34:50,031 --> 00:34:51,830
no matter how I put the probabilities,

553
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:55,280
I'd get almost the same variable because
it would be normally distributed with

554
00:34:55,281 --> 00:35:00,140
that standard deviation and that
expectation and normally distributed. Um,

555
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:05,240
as I said means it's determined by
standard deviation and expectation.

556
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:10,250
So, um, what, what do I,

557
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,200
okay, so I've just picked a
quarter, a half and a quarter.

558
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,910
It's as if I had two moves where you can
get to ups to go to here an up or down

559
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:23,030
or a down or up to go here
and two downs to go here.

560
00:35:23,031 --> 00:35:26,690
That's why I picked a quarter, a half
and a quarter. It's like I added two,

561
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,460
six month moves here. Uh, and
called it a one year move.

562
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:36,830
Okay. So if I keep dividing the process
and having it happen quicker and quicker,

563
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,370
I'm going to, you know, by the,

564
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,850
by the central limit theorem going to
get something normally distributed with a

565
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:44,100
corresponding standard deviation and mean.

566
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:49,110
So what is going to end up as the
standard deviation here and here? Okay,

567
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:56,160
well I I know to get the same variance
before I had a half sigma squared plus a

568
00:35:58,421 --> 00:36:03,130
half sigma squared that equals
sigma squared. But now my,

569
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:08,110
my variance is going to be
a quarter sigma. You know,

570
00:36:08,111 --> 00:36:12,550
this is the new sigma hat squared
plus a quarter sigma hat squared.

571
00:36:12,551 --> 00:36:16,450
Cause I'll go down whatever the sigma.
So now I should put a sigma hat here.

572
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:21,040
So of quarter sigma hat squared.
So if I look at the variance of the,

573
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,270
of the exponent,

574
00:36:22,271 --> 00:36:27,040
it's going to be a quarter sigma hat
squared plus a quarter sigma hat squared

575
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:31,780
plus a half times zero because half the
time you just get the average. Okay?

576
00:36:31,781 --> 00:36:33,970
So therefore it's,

577
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:38,680
it means a half sigma hat
squared has to equal six,

578
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,420
it has to equal sigma squared.

579
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:45,870
So therefore sigma hat squared has equal
to sigma squared and therefore sigma

580
00:36:46,691 --> 00:36:49,780
hat has equal the square
root of two times sigma.

581
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:55,080
So I should put the square root of two
here and the a square root of two here.

582
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:07,180
Okay, so now if I do a
trinomial, but I have, um,

583
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,450
you know, for the Trinomial
to be similar to the binomial,

584
00:37:10,451 --> 00:37:15,430
the binomial would be sort of here and
here and the trinomial in knows a lot of

585
00:37:15,431 --> 00:37:16,810
probability you're stuck in the middle.

586
00:37:16,811 --> 00:37:19,150
So to get the same kind of average spread,

587
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,730
I'm going to have to have this thing
sticking further out and this thing

588
00:37:21,731 --> 00:37:22,541
sticking further out.

589
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:26,640
But if I choose my numbers by multiplying
by the square root of two here, okay,

590
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:27,820
in the square root of two here,

591
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,230
the standard deviation of this trinomial
is the same as the standard deviation

592
00:37:32,231 --> 00:37:35,380
of the binomial. And the
expectation of the two are the same.

593
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,950
So a truck and I could do
the same thing with an end,

594
00:37:37,951 --> 00:37:41,200
no meal or an any number
thing I wanted to,

595
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:45,160
and I could always pick the standard
deviation properly, uh, you know,

596
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:48,910
pick these nodes properly so that I
had the same standard deviation and

597
00:37:48,911 --> 00:37:51,970
expectation as I did with
the original binomial tree.

598
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,930
So just because I've got three
nodes or five nodes on average,

599
00:37:55,931 --> 00:37:58,750
they can turn out to be the
same and the average spread,

600
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:02,680
the average spread squared can
also be the same as the binomial.

601
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,470
And if I do that,
okay,

602
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,360
I'm going to get a shockingly
similar answer. So,

603
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:14,020
um,
so let's just see what we get.

604
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:18,940
So what do I have to do now? I have to
do, I have to go to trinomial? Okay.

605
00:38:18,941 --> 00:38:20,110
So what did we do here?

606
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:24,850
We did 9% was the coupon we paint.

607
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,110
And the interest rates start at
8% in the volatility was a 16.

608
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:33,190
So if I go to Trinomial, okay, um,

609
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:39,790
okay, I put 9% to start 30 years, uh, 8%.

610
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:44,530
The starting rate and volatility is 16,
and now I have to do the up multiplier.

611
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,640
Okay. And by doing that, you see I've
multiplied up there in that formula,

612
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:51,610
there's a square root of two there,
two square root of two.

613
00:38:51,611 --> 00:38:55,480
So I've got just a slightly
more complicated thing. Uh,

614
00:38:55,481 --> 00:38:58,900
I've just multiplied by the square root
of two and that's what I've got all my

615
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:02,440
notes. So otherwise it's the same
thing. I do the same backward induction,

616
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,350
except instead of being a half a half,
you know,

617
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:08,410
I put a quarter here and a quarter here.

618
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:13,411
So it will be a quarter VSU
plus a quarter VSD plus a half,

619
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:18,070
you stay the same,
which will be nine plus v s,

620
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:23,530
um, same, whatever that is. Okay.
And so it's exactly the same. Okay.

621
00:39:23,531 --> 00:39:27,730
So I probably lost you. So
let me just say, I want to,

622
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:32,050
I want to convince you that this binomial
assumption is not such a special case.

623
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:35,380
Okay? So you should be thinking to
yourself two things happening next year.

624
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:38,770
That's ridiculous. I could
imagine a million things
happening next year. So I say,

625
00:39:38,771 --> 00:39:41,740
okay, I believe it a million
things could happen next year.

626
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,190
So I'm going to write down a million
things, not any million things.

627
00:39:45,191 --> 00:39:49,660
I'm going to say. Let's suppose that
instead of two things happening in a year,

628
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:54,810
I say I divide via what can happen over
the year into a million different up and

629
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:59,350
down moves. Now in order to replicate
sort of the original binomial,

630
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:03,130
those million up and down moves,
let's say 250 of them, one every day,

631
00:40:03,131 --> 00:40:06,520
those daily moves of course going to
be much smaller than the one year move.

632
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:11,530
But if I make the drift be the
old drift divided by two 50,

633
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:16,210
and the, the, uh, new standard
deviation of the tiny things be,

634
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:21,160
um, you know, the right ratio of
a standard deviation, then when I,

635
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:25,420
when I compute, you know, the
standard deviation at this,

636
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,860
of all the nodes here,

637
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,520
I'll get the same standard deviation is
the binomial and the same drift on the

638
00:40:30,521 --> 00:40:33,460
binomial. Okay? So if I ended
up with three nodes here,

639
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:37,030
I would just be multiplying by
the square root of two. Okay?

640
00:40:37,031 --> 00:40:41,440
And so by having a trinomial thing
with a slightly adjusted, uh, you know,

641
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:42,700
move up and down slightly,

642
00:40:42,701 --> 00:40:44,950
spreading it and putting some
probability in the middle,

643
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:48,100
I can have the same variance
and the same expectation.

644
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:50,260
If I had thousands of nodes here,

645
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:52,570
I'd also have the same variants
of the same expectation.

646
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:56,530
And so I did it just for the trinomial.
So let's see what happens to the value.

647
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,520
If we look now at the interest
rates. Okay. It was an uglier thing.

648
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:05,110
I couldn't do it quite as I was
too lazy to do it as neatly.

649
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:10,350
So the interest rates started at 8% and
now they can go up to 10 or down to 6.3

650
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,080
you know, so there are, and then the next
period they can go up to 12 and a half.

651
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,330
So that you see the different moves here.

652
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,180
Remember the other one was 6.8 and nine.
So there,

653
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,340
if you don't get the same
interest rate right away,

654
00:41:21,341 --> 00:41:25,090
you move more violently up or down.
So these three things,

655
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:28,450
these two are spread out further
than this, but at the same day. Okay.

656
00:41:28,451 --> 00:41:31,420
So what happens to the,
what happens to the price?

657
00:41:31,421 --> 00:41:36,421
The present value of the
non bond is 113.23 and what
was it before 113.236 okay.

658
00:41:41,691 --> 00:41:42,740
It's not so different.

659
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:47,030
And if I look now at the
value of a callable bond,

660
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:52,190
it's 95.142 and what was it
before 95.5 to nine okay.

661
00:41:52,191 --> 00:41:55,400
A little bit different.
So you can see that the trinomial thing,

662
00:41:55,650 --> 00:42:00,440
it gives you almost the same
answer as the binomial. And um,

663
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,460
okay. And so if I made the buying
or if I could, all right, so anyway,

664
00:42:04,461 --> 00:42:05,630
I don't want to say
anything more than that.

665
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:08,060
So no matter how many
nodes you have in the tree,

666
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,580
the binomials going to
give a good approximation,

667
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:13,920
provided that we shrink the periods
instead of looking at a year,

668
00:42:13,921 --> 00:42:16,820
are looking at daily moves
or minute by minute moves.

669
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:20,600
As long as those are binomial over a year,
a million things can happen.

670
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:25,340
And so you can restrict yourself to
binomial without any loss of generality.

671
00:42:25,341 --> 00:42:29,840
Just taking the time period short enough
because if it's a daily binomial over a

672
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:34,760
year, there's 250 outcomes or something.
And uh, you know, if it's over a minute,

673
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:36,560
then there are thousands
of outcomes over a year,

674
00:42:36,561 --> 00:42:41,480
even though each move is binomial
and you'll get the same answer. Okay?

675
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:44,420
So that's that.
All right,

676
00:42:44,421 --> 00:42:49,421
so we've done the a callable bond idea
in the call option is worth a lot.

677
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:53,030
Now let's talk,
let's take a more concrete example.

678
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:56,590
The one that you've all heard
your parents talking about.

679
00:42:56,610 --> 00:43:00,440
If you don't know on a house yourself,
which is a mortgage.

680
00:43:00,441 --> 00:43:03,860
And I just want to do the same thing
and help you start to think about how to

681
00:43:03,861 --> 00:43:07,040
value mortgages. Okay?
So what's a mortgage?

682
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:11,870
A mortgage is you don't have the
balloon payment at the end. You pay

683
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,940
the same amount each period.
So if you have a nine year,

684
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:29,470
if you have a nine year, if you
have a, let's take a mortgage.

685
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:32,170
So which example have I done here?
Okay,

686
00:43:32,171 --> 00:43:34,840
so I've got a mortgage rate of 7%

687
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:41,470
7% coupon, 7% coupon. You can see,

688
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:46,600
and it's a 30 year fixed rate mortgage,
okay?

689
00:43:46,601 --> 00:43:49,970
Now how much does that mean you
have to pay every year? Why isn't it

690
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:50,913
nice?

691
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:56,970
So every year, what are you going to
pay? You're not going to pay seven.

692
00:43:56,971 --> 00:44:01,950
What this means is whatever x you pay
every year, that's your annual payment,

693
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,370
and the 30th year you're
still going to pay X. Okay?

694
00:44:05,371 --> 00:44:10,371
But if I took this all over 1.07 plus
x over 1.07 squared plus this over 1.07

695
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:19,791
cubed plus this over 1.07 to the 30th I
would get a hundred k equals a hundred

696
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,170
so that's how x is chosen.

697
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,480
So that the constant payment,

698
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,830
the is an annuity of constant x.

699
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:38,370
Who's present value at the coupon is
equal to 100 that's how you define the

700
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:40,920
payment on a mortgage.
Okay?

701
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:45,840
So let's put a mortgage has to be
defined more completely than that.

702
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,340
You also have to say,

703
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:51,960
what do you get by
dissolving the mortgage?

704
00:44:51,961 --> 00:44:54,750
How much do you have to pay right away?

705
00:44:54,751 --> 00:44:59,130
You have to pay a hundred what would
you have to pay here if you dissolve the

706
00:44:59,131 --> 00:45:02,670
mortgage right after the,
so remaining balance.

707
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,473
Okay.

708
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,610
Equals payment.

709
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:09,660
Okay?

710
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,310
Just after coupon.

711
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:13,973
Okay.

712
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,570
Necessary.

713
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:17,490
Okay?

714
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:22,470
To dissolve a mortgage.
Okay?

715
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:25,180
So what do you think that,
so at the very beginning you,

716
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:27,840
you're the guy gave you a hundred if you
want to dissolve it and undo what you

717
00:45:27,841 --> 00:45:29,220
should be able to do
it for a hundred okay?

718
00:45:29,221 --> 00:45:33,150
But what about after the very first
year you've paid x? By the way,

719
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:38,180
x in this case is going to work
out to 8.05 you solve for x,

720
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:46,071
you get x 0.8 0.05 that 8.05 discounted
at 7% gives you a hundred okay,

721
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:53,001
so obviously x has to be bigger than
seven because if it were seven everywhere,

722
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:57,930
you need a 107 at the very end to make
it a hundred of course at the very end,

723
00:45:57,931 --> 00:46:02,250
that's 30 years later. So
that extra hundred can be
compensated by an extra one,

724
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:06,870
1.05 all the way along,
1.05 all the way along.

725
00:46:06,871 --> 00:46:09,180
It's just the same as an
extra hundred at the end.

726
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:13,560
So the payment is 8.05 so if
you're paying a 7% mortgage,

727
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:18,330
your annual payment is going to be
more than 7% it's going to be 8.05

728
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,100
okay. But in fact, yeah. Okay,

729
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:27,330
so that's the 7% coupon and the
mortgage coupon of mortgage.

730
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:29,020
Yeah.

731
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:33,190
Now if you want to get out
of the mortgage, it's called
prepaying. How do you,

732
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:36,460
what would you have to pay here to get
out of the mortgage, do you suppose?

733
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,880
What's the only logical thing
to have written in the contract?

734
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:41,850
Okay,

735
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:42,840
well you could pay a penalty,

736
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,450
but what if you don't want to have a
penalty then what should the guy paid to

737
00:46:45,451 --> 00:46:46,500
get out of the mortgage?

738
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,753
Yeah,

739
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:53,340
the remaining balance. Yes,
but what is the remaining
balance? That's the question.

740
00:46:53,341 --> 00:46:56,190
What is the remaining balance? Well,
maybe you know what the answer is.

741
00:46:58,410 --> 00:46:58,870
Okay.

742
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:00,460
Of what's left.
Okay,

743
00:47:00,461 --> 00:47:05,461
so the guy here are the remaining balance
be one ought to be this number without

744
00:47:06,221 --> 00:47:10,510
this. So you've only got 29 payments,
only going to put a one here now.

745
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:11,411
Right?

746
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:16,411
So it's B one B squared and being to
the 29th because you've made the first

747
00:47:16,721 --> 00:47:19,210
coupon payment,
you've got 29 years left,

748
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:23,890
assuming you know the same terms
as before, it still a 7% coupon.

749
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:28,270
So you should discount the remaining
29 years at 7% to get B one.

750
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,860
Okay, so B. So that's what B one is. Okay.

751
00:47:32,861 --> 00:47:37,861
So as you can see in the
thing B one is 98.94 okay?

752
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:43,360
Now,
not 98.94 is an interesting number.

753
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,750
You notice that the 8.05

754
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:53,340
8.05 minus seven okay happens to equal.

755
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,793
Um,

756
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,073
okay.

757
00:47:59,560 --> 00:47:59,980
Okay.

758
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:04,980
That a plus B one has to equal
a hundred k which is B zero.

759
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:10,300
Okay.

760
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:15,280
Okay. So why is that? So you started
owning the guy a hundred okay.

761
00:48:15,281 --> 00:48:16,460
You've borrowed a hundred you all,

762
00:48:16,461 --> 00:48:19,690
I'm a hundred and he's sort
of charging you 7% interest.

763
00:48:19,691 --> 00:48:20,860
That's the way the deal works.

764
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:24,010
So you would have expected
to only pay $7 next period.

765
00:48:24,011 --> 00:48:28,060
That's to keep up with the 7% interest.
But you know, he doesn't want,

766
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:29,830
remember why was this more,

767
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,800
why did the old mortgages go
from the balloon payment to this?

768
00:48:32,801 --> 00:48:37,801
Because in the depression in 1933 every
single farmer practically who old the

769
00:48:38,981 --> 00:48:42,370
hundred nine cause there's more
Asians coming up, defaulted.

770
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,870
So the lenders decided they didn't want
to be facing that situation where a guy

771
00:48:46,871 --> 00:48:51,460
owed 109 they'd rather have the guy pay
x every period where there's never this

772
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:54,310
gigantic payment that he's
going to default. In fact,

773
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:58,900
by paying x every period that lenders
in a safer and safer situation.

774
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:01,990
Why is that?
Because he's asking for acts,

775
00:49:01,991 --> 00:49:06,991
which is $8 even though the interest is
$7 so the the homeowners paying 8.05 the

776
00:49:08,411 --> 00:49:13,411
interest was only seven so he's making
an extra payment of $1.05 so what do you

777
00:49:13,781 --> 00:49:17,440
do with the extra $1.05 you write
down the balance. You say, okay,

778
00:49:17,441 --> 00:49:20,050
you've overpaid me by 1.05 I'm no longer,

779
00:49:20,051 --> 00:49:21,970
you're going to say you owe
a hundred you're going to,

780
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,690
oh now a hundred minus
1.05 okay. Uh, you know,

781
00:49:26,691 --> 00:49:30,190
all of this is x 0.05 had a
few decimal places after it.

782
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:34,720
And so it's going to be a 98.94136 okay,

783
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:38,770
so that's this gap.
So be zero minus p one

784
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:40,620
yeah,

785
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:45,330
the balance went down by exactly what
the overpayment was beyond the interest.

786
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:47,460
Okay.

787
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,020
So the fact that,
so you're always,

788
00:49:49,021 --> 00:49:53,310
and so the next time the balance is
going to go down even further because the

789
00:49:53,311 --> 00:49:58,110
next time the balance is only be
one the next time what the guy owes.

790
00:49:58,111 --> 00:49:59,760
If he was just paying the interest,

791
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:05,330
he ought to only 0.07 times B one and
yet he's still going to be paying 8.05 so

792
00:50:07,801 --> 00:50:12,801
B one minus p two so the balance B
two is going to go down even more.

793
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:16,140
So the gap from 100 to be
one is a very small one.

794
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:19,020
It's going to be bigger from B one to B
two and keep getting bigger and bigger

795
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:24,260
because each time the guy's paying eight
oh five but what he owes the balance

796
00:50:25,381 --> 00:50:26,191
that he owes on that,

797
00:50:26,191 --> 00:50:29,690
he's basically borrowed the money
on as a smaller and smaller number.

798
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:34,490
So he's overpaying the 7% interest by a
bigger and bigger amount and the balance

799
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:38,900
goes down by more and more each time.
Or to put it another way, if you take,

800
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,570
you know, uh, the first
thing is, you know,

801
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:44,830
be one is x times 1.07 1.07 squared,

802
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:49,430
1.07 29 B two is x 1.07 blah blah blah,

803
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:53,060
x times 1.07 to the 28th.
So the difference between this,

804
00:50:53,061 --> 00:50:57,080
and this is the last payment,
which was one of the 1.07 to the 29th.

805
00:50:57,350 --> 00:51:00,110
The difference between this
and this is the last payment,

806
00:51:00,111 --> 00:51:02,780
which was one of 1.07 to the 30th.
Okay.

807
00:51:02,781 --> 00:51:06,620
And so as that final maturity
gets smaller and smaller,

808
00:51:06,621 --> 00:51:07,820
the gap gets bigger and bigger.

809
00:51:07,821 --> 00:51:11,600
So I'm just rewriting the saying the same
thing in different ways. The roommate.

810
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:15,980
Okay. So any questions about this?
Did I go too fast or are you with me?

811
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,390
Somebody asks a question if you're lost.
Yes.

812
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:20,523
Yeah.

813
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:25,130
Why do I what?
I'm sorry.

814
00:51:25,131 --> 00:51:28,550
Why do I say it louder?
Why do I discount what?

815
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,060
Yes. This. Okay. So let me say
this again. You borrowed a hundred

816
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,000
okay.

817
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,940
The coupon is the agreed upon interest.

818
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,070
So you should all the guy,

819
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:50,050
$7 or $107 the next period,
right?

820
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:55,660
Not 100 anymore. There's 7% interest.
Now you all the guy 107 right?

821
00:51:56,230 --> 00:52:01,230
But at that moment when you owed him 107
you paid him eight oh five so the guy

822
00:52:02,451 --> 00:52:06,680
says, look, I lent you a hundred
I expect 107 back. Next period

823
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:11,430
you pay me eight oh five
that's more, you know, that's,

824
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:13,760
that's eight oh five so
what's left that you owe me

825
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:17,060
eight oh five it's,
it's,

826
00:52:17,061 --> 00:52:22,061
it's a a hundred minus the
1.05 so 98.4 something.

827
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,130
Okay, so you see, okay, so
let me just say it again.

828
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:37,150
You borrowed a hundred the next year
you all 107 we've already taken into

829
00:52:37,251 --> 00:52:41,150
account the interest rate.
That's 107 so we're sitting in next year,

830
00:52:41,151 --> 00:52:45,560
we're no longer sitting back here. B
One is as of next year. So the guy,

831
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:47,600
you should really buy rights,
be old.

832
00:52:47,601 --> 00:52:51,680
Now the lender should be
owed 107 now because he, he
he lent a hundred last year.

833
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:56,180
The agreed upon interest is 7% so
he should be getting 107 this year.

834
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,440
What is he getting?

835
00:52:57,441 --> 00:53:02,441
He's getting 8.05 so what's
left is 107 minus 8.05

836
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:05,760
yeah.

837
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,750
And that's what we have.

838
00:53:06,751 --> 00:53:11,751
What's left is 107 is exactly that.

839
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:16,230
So what's left is um,
he should be getting,

840
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:19,470
so this is seven he got paid.
So if I write it this way,

841
00:53:19,471 --> 00:53:24,300
107 he got paid 8.05 so what's,
what's he got?

842
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:26,760
So a hundred I'm just
rewriting the same thing.

843
00:53:26,761 --> 00:53:31,350
107 minus 8.05 is going to be,

844
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:32,290
uh,

845
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:37,110
the new B One k which is
happens to equal 90 you know,

846
00:53:37,111 --> 00:53:41,790
whatever that is.
98.5 4.505 something like that.

847
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:46,260
98 Oh eight eight 98.95

848
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:48,950
yeah.

849
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:51,410
Right.
So this is 1.05.

850
00:53:51,411 --> 00:53:56,411
So 1.05 plus this is a hundred so 107
minus 8.05 is 98.95 you agree with that?

851
00:53:58,011 --> 00:53:59,210
Right.
Okay.

852
00:53:59,211 --> 00:54:03,740
So what I'm saying is a year later you
were owed 107 you were paid 8.05 so

853
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:07,910
obviously what's left that you're owed
is the difference 98.95 and that's

854
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:11,600
exactly what the equation was
that I wrote before. Okay.

855
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,920
Any other questions?

856
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,640
Okay, so you can always divide a
mortgage payment into the interest part.

857
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:26,200
So any mortgage payment x can
be divided into the interest.

858
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,440
Now it's a race this,
and I'm saying it another words.

859
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:38,310
Okay. So your payments are x everywhere
up to the last period and your remaining

860
00:54:38,311 --> 00:54:43,311
balance is going to be B
one B two B three you know,

861
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:47,460
and be 30 which is obviously Poopa zero.
Okay.

862
00:54:47,461 --> 00:54:52,461
So you can always get out of the mortgage
by paying after you make a coupon,

863
00:54:52,651 --> 00:54:55,020
payment acts,
you can get out of it by paying be too.

864
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,490
So your mortgage payment is going
to be divided into the interest.

865
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,880
Okay.
And then the scheduled

866
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:07,380
principal reduction.

867
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:15,750
Hey,
so here you pay 8.05 you only,

868
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:20,160
the interest was only 7% so
you've overpaid. So that's
why the balance goes down.

869
00:55:20,161 --> 00:55:21,750
That's the scheduled balance.

870
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:25,680
It's called principal at scale and
you'll balance reduction. Okay?

871
00:55:25,681 --> 00:55:26,514
And if you want,

872
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,880
you can prepay and pay off
part of the remaining balance.

873
00:55:32,191 --> 00:55:36,570
Any part you want to.
So let me say it again in some period.

874
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:41,460
Uh, let's say three. What do you, what,
what could you do in period three? Well,

875
00:55:41,461 --> 00:55:43,290
by the time you've
weighed into period three,

876
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,620
you've got to pay the coupon X.
Okay?

877
00:55:46,621 --> 00:55:51,621
Now the coupon x is way in
excess of 7% times been to it's,

878
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:56,010
it's eight and 7% of a
hundred is less than X.

879
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,110
We're already down to
a balance of being too.

880
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,200
So the ACS is bigger than 7% of B two.

881
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:05,250
So 7% of B two was the interest.
Okay? But on top of that,

882
00:56:05,251 --> 00:56:10,020
you paid more than that. So that extra
you paid reduced the remaining balance.

883
00:56:10,021 --> 00:56:13,920
That's the scheduled reduction. And the
remaining balance, you paid that off.

884
00:56:13,921 --> 00:56:16,980
You have no choice about that.
But now in addition, if you want,

885
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:19,920
you can pay the B3 and get
rid of the whole mortgage.

886
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:23,920
That's the rules of a mortgage.
Is that clear to everybody? Okay,

887
00:56:23,921 --> 00:56:27,310
so any mortgage that you
get works by those rules.

888
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:36,130
Okay. So we have to figure out
the value of the mortgage somehow.

889
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:39,560
I feel I'm going too fast cause
someone asks a question if you're lost,

890
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:41,150
I need to pick out.
Yes.

891
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:44,890
So what you just said applies to,
as time goes on,

892
00:56:44,891 --> 00:56:48,320
you pay a bigger and bigger
chunk of principal success.

893
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:52,400
Yes. So the mortgage is
called an amortizing mortgage.

894
00:56:52,401 --> 00:56:55,460
This was a great invention. You
know, at the time of the depression,

895
00:56:55,461 --> 00:56:56,360
after the depression,

896
00:56:56,361 --> 00:56:59,720
I probably had been invented before
but was used in a big way after that.

897
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:04,070
I don't know the person's
name who invented it and it
has the property that the

898
00:57:04,071 --> 00:57:04,761
roommate first.

899
00:57:04,761 --> 00:57:08,540
It has the property that you're always
paying more because you're paying level

900
00:57:08,541 --> 00:57:12,050
payments. You must always be
paying your principal down.

901
00:57:12,051 --> 00:57:15,950
That makes the lender's safer and safer
because it's the same house protecting

902
00:57:15,951 --> 00:57:17,090
as long as collateral.

903
00:57:17,091 --> 00:57:20,930
We haven't come to collateral and how the
whole world depends on collateral yet,

904
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,800
but we're going to believe me,
we're going to get there. And uh,

905
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:27,380
so we haven't gotten to collateral yet,
but when we get to it,

906
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:29,510
the lender's protected by the house,

907
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:33,530
the amount that's owed to him started a
hundred. It's getting lower every period.

908
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:35,510
So he's feeling safer and safer.

909
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:39,830
That contrast to the old lenders during
the depression who were at the most

910
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:43,310
vulnerable right at the end. Oh,
I've lost it. Right? Most vulnerable.

911
00:57:43,311 --> 00:57:44,870
Right at the end here,

912
00:57:44,871 --> 00:57:49,700
these lenders are getting less and
less vulnerable as time goes on. Okay?

913
00:57:49,701 --> 00:57:51,800
So that's the advantage
of an amortizing mortgage.

914
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:56,801
Now it's so happens that the rate of
amortization gets big faster and faster.

915
00:57:56,931 --> 00:58:00,140
So these numbers start at a hundred and
stay pretty close to a hundred and then

916
00:58:00,141 --> 00:58:04,490
they go down pretty fast, which is what
his point is. And that's absolutely right.

917
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:07,980
And so if you look at the remaining
balance says here in this chart,

918
00:58:07,981 --> 00:58:12,330
it started at 101 to 98 one to 97, 96, 95.

919
00:58:12,331 --> 00:58:17,070
Now 93 92 98 you know,
they're going down faster and faster.

920
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,181
You keep going,

921
00:58:18,181 --> 00:58:22,500
you're going to see that they're going
in all they start leaping down from 73 76

922
00:58:22,501 --> 00:58:26,180
to 73 73 to 70 so you know,
you know,

923
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:30,420
now they're starting to go from 43 to 38
there really by percentage is going way

924
00:58:30,421 --> 00:58:34,500
down really fast, you know, 21
to 14 to seven to zero. Okay?

925
00:58:34,501 --> 00:58:38,220
So they go down really fast at the
end of the remaining balance. Okay?

926
00:58:38,221 --> 00:58:42,510
But that's just the way the amortizing
fixed, uh, interest mortgage works.

927
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,160
Okay. Now we want to think about how to
value it. All right? So the way we, yeah,

928
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:48,150
so now let's suppose the,
okay,

929
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:53,300
so we've got the payment is eight the
coupon that they agreed on in the mortgage

930
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:59,460
was 7% but that's different from what the
interest rate is in the whole economy,

931
00:59:00,211 --> 00:59:03,030
which is 6% say.

932
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:08,230
So suppose the interest rate is 6% why
would it be that with a 6% interest rate

933
00:59:09,091 --> 00:59:12,480
today, one year interest rate
today? Why would it be that?

934
00:59:12,481 --> 00:59:16,830
If the interest rate was 6% today,
too complicated the street,

935
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:21,620
the interest rate were 6% today.
Why?

936
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:30,940
Why would it be that the mortgage rate
that people would agree to be 6% why is

937
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:33,560
it that the interest that,

938
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:38,590
why is it that the mortgage rate people
could agreed to since the 7.3% and this

939
00:59:39,171 --> 00:59:43,340
went down to, you know,
4.9% that's in that tree.

940
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:44,713
Okay.

941
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:50,330
Okay, so you tell me why is it that
when the interest rate is 6% today,

942
00:59:50,331 --> 00:59:54,680
so everybody knows on average it's going
to stay around 6% and here I want to

943
00:59:54,681 --> 00:59:58,310
get a loan from a bank to buy a house
and I put up my spectacular houses as

944
00:59:58,311 --> 01:00:03,110
collateral so the banks should feel safe.
It's amortizing and all of that. Um,

945
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:06,290
they should feel safe as long as they
haven't lent me too much money. Right.

946
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:06,651
By the way,

947
01:00:06,651 --> 01:00:10,190
if my house is only worth $80 and they
lend me a hundred then the bank's in

948
01:00:10,191 --> 01:00:10,611
trouble.

949
01:00:10,611 --> 01:00:14,690
If the house is worth 100 and they lend
me a hundred the bank might be in some

950
01:00:14,691 --> 01:00:17,060
vulnerable situation if
the house loses value.

951
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:22,270
So banks would have to be stupid as they
were to make loans of the home value

952
01:00:22,371 --> 01:00:24,860
almost equal to the house value.
But we're going to come back to that.

953
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:29,090
So suppose the house is worth way more
than a hundred they lend me the, the,

954
01:00:29,091 --> 01:00:31,250
the amount I'm owning the
bank is only going down.

955
01:00:31,251 --> 01:00:35,930
So the house is protecting the bank
completely has no worries of me defaulting

956
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:38,930
cause it'll just take my house.
Let's take that case.

957
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:44,890
The interest rate and the economy is
6% and here the bank is charging me 7%

958
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:48,860
mortgage rate.
That's what we agree on.

959
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:51,110
And of course when the charges
to be 70% mortgage rate,

960
01:00:51,111 --> 01:00:52,730
I'm going paying $8 every month.

961
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:56,000
How could that possibly be
fair or to put it another way,

962
01:00:56,120 --> 01:01:01,120
why does the bank have to
charge an mortgage rate
that's way above the starting

963
01:01:01,401 --> 01:01:06,040
interest rate? Why would it have
to do that? Why does it do it?

964
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:07,420
Why is everyone willing to pay it?

965
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,510
You see what the question is back there?
Yes.

966
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,890
Right.
I've got this really valuable option,

967
01:01:17,891 --> 01:01:21,370
which of course the bank realizes
I can always get out of it.

968
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,680
I can pay the remaining
balance and get out of it.

969
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:28,840
Now what am I hoping for when I take
my 7% mortgage out from the bank?

970
01:01:28,841 --> 01:01:32,680
What am I hoping for? How am I
going to make money? The homeowner?

971
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:35,183
Yes.

972
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:39,240
Right?
So if there's some tremendous inflation,

973
01:01:39,241 --> 01:01:43,590
like there might well be now
some tremendous inflation
in the next five years.

974
01:01:43,591 --> 01:01:45,900
This is a 30 year loan.
If for the next five years,

975
01:01:45,901 --> 01:01:49,080
you know the economy's in so much trouble
and you've got all these homeowners

976
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:51,840
underwater and we owe so
much money to the Chinese,

977
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:56,010
we could well see the Fed
engineering a gigantic inflation.

978
01:01:56,011 --> 01:02:00,420
So the interest rate might go up to 10%
I'm continuing to borrow effectively at

979
01:02:00,421 --> 01:02:04,890
7% from the, from the
bank. How can you see that?

980
01:02:04,891 --> 01:02:06,210
Because this remaining balance,

981
01:02:06,211 --> 01:02:10,800
remember the whole way it's structured is
w you know the payments I after a year,

982
01:02:10,801 --> 01:02:13,020
the hundred I borrowed
goes down to be one,

983
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:17,520
but it's like a 20 year mortgage where
I borrowed be one again at 7% interest

984
01:02:17,521 --> 01:02:20,670
after the third year when I
just after making my payment,

985
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:25,700
both the 27 years left of the mortgage
are treated explicitly by the law of the

986
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:30,660
contract as if I borrowed
be $3 at 7% interest.

987
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:31,501
So in other words,

988
01:02:31,501 --> 01:02:36,501
a mortgage is like a contract where every
year I get to reborrow at 7% but I'm

989
01:02:37,381 --> 01:02:42,381
borrowing a smaller and smaller amount
so I perpetually get to borrow at 7% but

990
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:45,360
I have the option of canceling the
whole thing by paying off the remaining

991
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:46,020
balance.

992
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:49,530
So I'm hoping that the interest rate's
going to go to 12% and I'm going to be

993
01:02:49,531 --> 01:02:54,030
borrowing still at 7% borrowing at 7%
and reinvesting in at 12% I'll make a

994
01:02:54,031 --> 01:02:57,030
killing. I'm praying for
interest rates to go up. Now,

995
01:02:57,031 --> 01:02:59,790
most homeowners think that they're
praying for interest rates to go down,

996
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:01,410
but they just have it all backwards.

997
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:04,980
They think of interest rates go down and
get a norm lower mortgage with a lower

998
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:08,640
interest. They don't realize that the
present value of their future payments is,

999
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:12,060
are going to go up. So they should be
hoping for the interest rates to go up.

1000
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:14,460
They should be opening for big inflation.
Okay.

1001
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:15,810
And that's when they're
going to make money.

1002
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:18,630
So that and the option
that the homeowner gains,

1003
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:22,320
if interest rates go up and the homeowner
can always get out of the mortgage and

1004
01:03:22,321 --> 01:03:25,440
pay it off, if interest rates go down
by paying off the remaining balance,

1005
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:29,880
that's tremendously valuable. Okay,
so how do we compute that value?

1006
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:36,030
We have to do it by backward induction.
Okay, so you can't, you know,

1007
01:03:36,031 --> 01:03:37,980
you can intuitively
see there's some value,

1008
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:41,010
but you don't know exactly what it is
until you do it by backward induction.

1009
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:45,600
So here, you know, the payments
are always ate. The payments.

1010
01:03:45,601 --> 01:03:46,710
We said we're eight,

1011
01:03:46,711 --> 01:03:51,711
we're a 8.05 and 8.05 you know,

1012
01:03:53,101 --> 01:03:56,310
and then at the end,
8.05

1013
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:07,420
okay.
So we know that at the end the value,

1014
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:10,300
the, the, the, the present value
of what the bank is going to,

1015
01:04:10,301 --> 01:04:13,480
all the present value of how much the
homeowner is going to have to pay.

1016
01:04:13,481 --> 01:04:17,590
Let's do it that way. He's going to be
zero. Okay? So we know that at this point,

1017
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:21,430
what's the value that's left as zero
because there are no payments after this

1018
01:04:21,431 --> 01:04:25,710
final. That's your 30 the no payments
after that. So what is the value add?

1019
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:29,140
So assume that we've figured out the
value and we're working backwards.

1020
01:04:29,141 --> 01:04:33,100
So we're at some node like this one where
we know the interest rate and we want

1021
01:04:33,101 --> 01:04:38,101
to figure out what the value is here
just after the coupon payments made.

1022
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:41,830
So what's the value?
Well, the homeowner has,

1023
01:04:41,831 --> 01:04:46,831
the option of making remaining balance
from member was being one B two and this

1024
01:04:48,581 --> 01:04:53,470
is [inaudible]. So at this
node here, okay, this is zero.

1025
01:04:53,471 --> 01:04:54,430
This is times zero.

1026
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:59,940
So we have the zero equals a
hundred at time one the homeowner,

1027
01:05:00,581 --> 01:05:05,050
he's made the payment here.
So at time one he could, uh,

1028
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:09,520
just pay B one and B out
of the whole thing. Okay.

1029
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:13,900
Or he could make his payment.
So if he makes his payment,

1030
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:18,250
then he owes the 8.05. So half the, sorry,

1031
01:05:18,251 --> 01:05:21,280
he's just made his payment
so he can either get out of
the whole thing by paying

1032
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:24,250
Dijuan or you could wait to
see what happens next period.

1033
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:26,350
So half the time he's going to go up,

1034
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:31,890
so he's going to have to pay 8.05 and
then he's going to have a decision then to

1035
01:05:32,081 --> 01:05:34,270
me. But we've already, we're
working by backwards deductions.

1036
01:05:34,271 --> 01:05:37,180
We've already solved out for what
the value of his decision is there.

1037
01:05:37,181 --> 01:05:40,090
So it's going to be s up.
Okay.

1038
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:43,760
Plus half the time,
uh,

1039
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:47,440
he's going to have to pay 8.05, he's
going to be down here, but we've,

1040
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:50,110
and then he's going to have the remaining,
you know,

1041
01:05:50,111 --> 01:05:52,990
he's going to have to decide whether to
pay off the remaining balance or down.

1042
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:56,860
And vs down is that decision.
Okay.

1043
01:05:56,890 --> 01:06:00,370
Cause we've already figured out whether
he should prepay or not here. Okay.

1044
01:06:00,371 --> 01:06:01,204
So that's it.

1045
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:05,800
It couldn't be simpler at every node
after the coupon payment is made,

1046
01:06:05,801 --> 01:06:10,660
the guy has the choice of pain or um,
I mean if prepaying,

1047
01:06:10,661 --> 01:06:10,931
you know,

1048
01:06:10,931 --> 01:06:14,200
paying off the remaining
balance or waiting till the
next period and then he has

1049
01:06:14,201 --> 01:06:16,990
to pay the coupon if he
waits till next period.

1050
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:20,230
And if he doesn't pay the coupon then um,

1051
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:23,980
okay.

1052
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,520
Oh, what happened to the interest
rate? Well I forgot it, so thank you.

1053
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:30,880
So I have to put this in brackets

1054
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:36,930
and multiply by one over 1.049.

1055
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:40,230
That's what happened. The
interest rate, I just forgot it.

1056
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:44,010
So either he pays the remaining balance
or he waits and of course he has to

1057
01:06:44,011 --> 01:06:46,950
discount it by the interest rate there,
which is of a 1.04,

1058
01:06:46,951 --> 01:06:51,030
nine times a half times what happens
over here plus a half times what happens

1059
01:06:51,031 --> 01:06:53,520
over here.
That's it.

1060
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:56,670
And that's what I've
written down in the nodes.

1061
01:06:56,671 --> 01:07:00,660
So here are the interest rate nodes
and here are the present value.

1062
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:05,730
So here's the non callable mortgage.
Okay, so the non callable mortgage,

1063
01:07:05,731 --> 01:07:09,650
if the at the homeowner, we're so
stupid that he never prepaid and he's,

1064
01:07:09,830 --> 01:07:14,830
and the interest rate is 7% the mortgage
interest rate is 7% and the interest

1065
01:07:14,971 --> 01:07:18,490
rate starts at 6%. That's obviously
great for the bank. The Guy Stupid,

1066
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:23,250
they always going to pay never prepaids
the bank makes $109 but if the guy is

1067
01:07:23,251 --> 01:07:24,600
much smarter than that,

1068
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:31,110
if the guys much smarter than that,
um,

1069
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:33,433
sorry,

1070
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:37,350
that's the guy, he's much smarter
than that and he's going to call.

1071
01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:42,030
And now lo and behold, the
valley's only 95.55. Okay?

1072
01:07:42,031 --> 01:07:47,031
The option is so valuable that even
though the interest rate is 7% is 6% the

1073
01:07:48,751 --> 01:07:53,670
mortgage rate is 7% the bankers chart
incredibly overcharging him and the,

1074
01:07:53,671 --> 01:07:56,760
uh, you know, and, and, and
the guy will never default.

1075
01:07:56,761 --> 01:08:00,780
Still the bank is getting a terrible
deal because the option is so valuable to

1076
01:08:00,781 --> 01:08:02,940
the, to the, uh, to the guy.

1077
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:10,240
Okay. So what is the bank going to
do in that case? What would a bank do

1078
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:16,020
if you were the banker?

1079
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:20,010
What would you do? The interest rate is
6% you can't control the interest rates.

1080
01:08:20,011 --> 01:08:21,000
That's the whole economy.

1081
01:08:21,001 --> 01:08:24,920
Everybody's patience and impatience and
all the Fisher stuff is determining all

1082
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:29,880
these interest rates. What would you
do for your, uh, what would you do?

1083
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:32,910
You, you wouldn't charge
7% is your mortgage rate.

1084
01:08:32,911 --> 01:08:37,380
You'd have to charge a higher mortgage
rate. Maybe you charge 8% okay.

1085
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,860
And so we could just change the whole
thing to 8% and we do it and you'll see

1086
01:08:40,861 --> 01:08:43,140
that the guy will do better.
So the mortgage rate,

1087
01:08:43,141 --> 01:08:48,090
let's put it as 0.075 okay.

1088
01:08:48,091 --> 01:08:52,350
Instead of 0.07 so now the annual
payments gone up and everything's going to

1089
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:56,220
change. And so the interest
rate process is the same.

1090
01:08:56,221 --> 01:09:01,221
If the guy never prepaids it's now
worth 114 and if the guy does prepay

1091
01:09:01,231 --> 01:09:01,741
optimally,

1092
01:09:01,741 --> 01:09:06,270
well you still haven't gotten it high
enough of have to make it 8% maybe. Okay.

1093
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:10,320
So the interest rate looks like
it'll have to get to a lot above

1094
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:16,980
6% maybe we'll have to go to
8% maybe 8% isn't enough. Well,

1095
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:18,121
on average,

1096
01:09:18,121 --> 01:09:23,070
let's just write 0.08 and now
we can see how that worked out.

1097
01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:25,350
Interest rate processes the same.

1098
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:29,100
Look at this and the guy never prepays
it's worth 120 if he does free pay,

1099
01:09:29,101 --> 01:09:31,860
it's still not enough. So it's
going to have to be 9% or something.

1100
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:37,340
Now typically if the interest rate is
6% the mortgage rate will be something

1101
01:09:37,501 --> 01:09:42,300
like seven and a half percent not
the 9% or 10% I'd have to get up to.

1102
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:43,980
So why do you think that is?

1103
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:46,773
Yes,

1104
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:53,940
exactly.
You have to count on the dumb p.

1105
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:59,020
So that's an important fact of life.
You not only have to count on them,

1106
01:09:59,021 --> 01:09:59,920
you have to count them.

1107
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:05,160
So you have to figure out what
fraction of the population is this.

1108
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:07,930
It's going to only pay you 98 in the end.

1109
01:10:08,110 --> 01:10:10,630
And what fraction of
the population is this?

1110
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:13,120
They're going to pay you 120 in the end.
Okay.

1111
01:10:13,121 --> 01:10:16,030
And if you knew which of
the guys with 120 guys,

1112
01:10:16,031 --> 01:10:19,750
what fraction with 120 guys and
what fraction of their 98 guys,

1113
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:24,040
you'd know what the, the, uh,
the thing was worth. Okay.

1114
01:10:24,041 --> 01:10:28,810
And it's going to be okay,
so, all right, so, um,

1115
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:31,690
how far am I going? All right. So
if you're a mortgage hedge fund,

1116
01:10:31,691 --> 01:10:35,080
my company is a mortgage hedge fund.
That's where we started out with.

1117
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:40,000
We quickly did these calculations
and now, um, all right,

1118
01:10:40,001 --> 01:10:43,330
so if you look at the data, you're
going to find, oh, by the way,

1119
01:10:43,331 --> 01:10:47,380
Sunday I'm having remember this extra
class Sunday night to tell you a little

1120
01:10:47,381 --> 01:10:48,460
bit about the real world.

1121
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:51,790
So I'm going to save the stories of
all the data and stuff until then.

1122
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:55,990
But basically we look at how people
have behaved in the past, you know,

1123
01:10:56,050 --> 01:10:59,560
so we're doing this tree and we're
figuring out, you know, from this tree,

1124
01:10:59,561 --> 01:11:03,100
you can figure out when the people
should have prepaid or not. Okay.

1125
01:11:03,101 --> 01:11:07,390
Actually the next tree, if you have
a dollar's worth of principle, okay.

1126
01:11:07,391 --> 01:11:12,340
If you assume that the original principal
was a dollar instead of a hundred and

1127
01:11:12,341 --> 01:11:13,920
you always figured out at every node,

1128
01:11:13,921 --> 01:11:18,000
what would a dollar's worth of principle
be there. Okay, you can, you can,

1129
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:21,600
you can find out in an easy
way when people should prepay.

1130
01:11:21,601 --> 01:11:24,270
So here you can see where all the ones
are is when they should have prepaid.

1131
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,330
So I don't have time now to explain that.
But anyway,

1132
01:11:27,331 --> 01:11:30,720
just a slight modification of the tree
shows you one, they should prepay.

1133
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:34,290
So you can look at when people should
prepay and he can look in the data at how

1134
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:38,280
many of the people do prepay. So
you can go house by house, you know,

1135
01:11:38,281 --> 01:11:41,880
it's public information. Are these people
prepaying or aren't they prepaying?

1136
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,170
How smart are they?

1137
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:48,030
And you can deduce from having watched
them in the past miss opportunity after

1138
01:11:48,031 --> 01:11:50,760
opportunity to prepay.
You know that these guys now,

1139
01:11:50,761 --> 01:11:52,530
it's not a matter of being stupid.
In fact,

1140
01:11:52,531 --> 01:11:54,300
the smartest people might
be the ones not prepaying,

1141
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:58,260
they're not paying attention or maybe
it's a real hassle for them to prepay.

1142
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,450
So we're going to come to the
reasons why they won't prepay.

1143
01:12:00,451 --> 01:12:04,650
So you have to calibrate how many people
are behaving optimally and how many

1144
01:12:04,651 --> 01:12:05,484
people aren't.

1145
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:08,640
And then you can judge how high you
have to set the interest rate to make a

1146
01:12:08,641 --> 01:12:12,480
reasonable profit. And I'm going
to talk more about that next time.
