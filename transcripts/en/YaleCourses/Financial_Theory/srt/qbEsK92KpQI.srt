1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:05,220
So we're talking now about
mortgages and how to value them.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,900
And if you remember a mortgage,

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,290
so the first mortgages, by the way, uh,

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,700
that we know have come from Babylonian
Times. It's not like, you know,

5
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:20,490
some American invented
the mortgage or something.

6
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:24,660
This was a 3,500,
3000,

7
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:29,160
800 years old. And we have on these
cuneiform tablets, these mortgages.

8
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:32,910
And so the idea of a mortgage
is you make a promise,

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,090
you back your promise with collaterals.
So if you don't keep the promise,

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,010
they can take your house and there's
some way of getting out of the promise

11
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:47,520
because everybody knows that you
might, the collateral, you know,

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,770
you might want to leave the home and
then you have to have some way of

13
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:53,040
dissolving the promise because the
promise involves many payments over time.

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,600
So it's making a promise,

15
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,730
backing it with collateral and finding
a way to dissolve the promise that exp

16
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,340
prearranged terms in case you
want to end it by prepaying.

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,120
And that prepaying is called
the refinancing option.

18
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,030
And because there's a refinancing option,

19
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,540
it makes the mortgage a
much more complicated thing.

20
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,470
And a much more interesting thing
and something that, for example,

21
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:20,190
a hedge fund could man could imagine
that it could make money trading.

22
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,300
So I just want to give you a slight
indication of how that could happen.

23
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,050
So as we said, if you have a
typical mortgage, you know,

24
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:32,730
say the mortgage rate is 8% maybe there's
a different answer than I do. Uh, okay.

25
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:37,731
So here we have an 8% mortgage with
a 6% interest rate to begin with.

26
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,490
Okay?
Now if it's an 8% mortgage,

27
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,450
the guy's going to have to pay much
more than 8% a year because a mortgage,

28
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:48,270
remember their level payments,
we're talking about fixed rate mortgages,

29
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:51,390
you pay the same amount every
single year for 30 years.

30
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:52,620
Now you're really paying monthly.

31
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,580
And I've ignored the monthly business
cause it's just too many months. Uh,

32
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,780
and there's 360 of them. So I'm
thinking of it as an annual payment.

33
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:05,500
You have to pay, of course more than
$8 a year, because if you're paying a,

34
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:10,410
if the mortgage rate were 8% and you had
a balloon payment on the ad and you pay

35
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:14,940
eight eight 108, that's the way they
used to work. But they were changed,

36
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,690
you know, so you could imagine the old
fashioned mortgage would pay eight eight,

37
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:19,021
eight,
eight,

38
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:23,490
eight 108 if you didn't pay your eight
somewhere along the line they confiscate

39
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:27,390
your whole house. Um, and then
take what was owed out of it.

40
00:02:27,391 --> 00:02:31,140
And you could get out of it by paying
100 the new mortgages instead of paying

41
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,830
eight every year for 30 years,
you pay 8.8 every year for 30 years.

42
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:38,820
Because if you discount payments
of 8.8 forever, for 30 years,

43
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:41,130
at 8% you get a hundred.

44
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,280
So the present value is a hundred at
the agreed upon discounting rate or

45
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:49,200
mortgage rate, 8%. And so the,

46
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,360
you see how important this a discount
rate is and the remaining balance however,

47
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,260
is more it goes down because
every time you're paying,

48
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:02,440
you're paying more than the 8% interest
you're paying in the first year,

49
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:03,880
8.8 instead of eight.

50
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:08,881
And so that gap of 0.8 0.88 is used to
reduce the balance from a hundred to

51
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:11,920
99.117 and as you see,

52
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:16,120
the balance is going down over time
and making the lender's safer and safer

53
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:20,020
because the same houses backing it,
so it's called an amortizing mortgage.

54
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,630
Now why is it difficult to value?

55
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,190
Because you have the option
anytime you want and it's,

56
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,600
there's a good reason for that option.
Anytime you want,

57
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:32,230
you have the option of getting out of
the mortgage and just saying, okay,

58
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:35,860
I've paid three payments of 8.88
I don't want to do it anymore.

59
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,860
I want to pay off 97.13 and
then let's call it quits.

60
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,690
And they say, okay, and there's
nothing they can do about it. Now,

61
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,850
when are you going to
exercise that option?

62
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,960
You're going to exercise that option
either because you have to move.

63
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:53,290
That's the intention of it.
Or you'll exercise at one.

64
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,300
It's most advantageous to you.
Now,

65
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:59,020
why could it become advantageous
to exercise it? Well,

66
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,420
you don't really want
to exercise the option,

67
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:04,660
and this is the way most people think
of it backwards. They think, oh,

68
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,220
the interest rates are going down.

69
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,040
That means I'll get a new mortgage
with a lower interest rate.

70
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,270
They sh they're hoping for exactly the
wrong thing. If the interest rates go up,

71
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,570
what they've got is a much better,
uh,

72
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,770
mortgage because they're continuing to
buy at the same 8% interest and maybe,

73
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,280
uh,
interest rates and the economy.

74
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,510
If we come 12% and they're
actually making money.

75
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,710
So people who borrow in times
of high inflation do better.

76
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,920
When there's times of deflation,
the borrowers get crushed.

77
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,180
Irving Fisher said one of the main
reasons for the depression being so bad is

78
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:40,240
all the entrepreneurial people in
the account, in the country as usual.

79
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:44,080
We're borrowing. And then
there was a deflation, and
so they were getting crushed.

80
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:48,220
And the very people who drive the economy,
we're being hurt the most. And so he,

81
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,150
that feedback he said was responsible
for the severity part of the severity of

82
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:54,820
the depression. So you see
interest rates can go up or down.

83
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,550
And what happens when they go up,

84
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,880
they go up high enough to 19% you think,
my gosh,

85
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:02,710
I've made a fortune holding this mortgage.

86
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm still borrowing at 7% 8% and um,
I'm uh,

87
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,050
you know,
I can invest my money at 19% so you're,

88
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,770
you've made a fortune and the poor
lenders gotten crushed. On the other hand,

89
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,900
if the interest rates go way down here,

90
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:21,190
so the present value of what you owe
if you kept paying, it becomes huge.

91
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,090
You don't have to face that big loss
because you just prepay at whatever the

92
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,720
remaining balance is there and then your,

93
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,100
you've protected your downside.

94
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,450
So by paying attention and deciding
when the optimal time to prepay is,

95
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:39,400
you can save yourself a lot of money and
thereby costs the bank a lot of money.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,420
So when exactly should you prepay
when she's, you exercise your option?

97
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:45,670
Well in this example,
if you've never exercised it,

98
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:50,850
you'd be handing the bank effectively
$120 even though if I lent you 20 so the

99
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:54,190
bank would have made a 20% profit on you,

100
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,460
but if you exercise your ah,
your option optimally,

101
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:03,560
you're going to make not a hundred.
Uh, you're not going to make,

102
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,870
the bank is not going
to get $100 out of you.

103
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:07,670
They're going to even get
less than a hundred dollars.

104
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:10,670
They're going to get $98 out of you.
Okay.

105
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:15,270
So when exactly should you be
exercising your option? Well, I,

106
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,990
we went over this last time.
I'll do it once again.

107
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,320
So remember the payment you
old was 8.88 8.88 blah blah,

108
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:26,750
blah.
8.88.

109
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,040
The remaining balance started of course
at a hundred and then it went down to

110
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:35,060
99.11 and then it kept
going down from there.

111
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,790
Hey Saul, since I can't
remember the numbers, uh,

112
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,990
let's just call this B one the
remaining balance, which happened to be,

113
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,080
you know,
it was 99 point 11 the first time.

114
00:06:50,081 --> 00:06:53,440
Let's call this B one and
then I went to B, two B,

115
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:55,660
three et Cetera,

116
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,370
and then be 30 it was equal to zero,
no remaining balance after that.

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,890
Okay, so we said, what should you do?

118
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:05,290
I'm going to do the calculation
now a little bit differently.

119
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:10,590
I said after every payment of 8.88
you could always say to yourself,

120
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:15,250
do I want to continue or
do I want to pay my option?

121
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:20,730
Now you notice that if I had divided
this by B one say if you had a mortgage

122
00:07:21,551 --> 00:07:26,080
that was a little bit smaller,
barely over a dollar, for example,

123
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,040
um,
the payments would,

124
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,490
the payments would all that would divide
everything by B one the payments would

125
00:07:33,491 --> 00:07:36,070
all be divided by B one.
Okay.

126
00:07:36,071 --> 00:07:38,710
And the remaining balances
would all be divided by B one.

127
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,140
So I could always scale
this thing up or down.

128
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:46,120
There's nothing fancy about a hundred,
nothing important. About a hundred.

129
00:07:46,121 --> 00:07:47,920
If the original coupon,

130
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,730
the original loan was for 200 you just
double all your payments and double all

131
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:54,010
your remaining balances.
What could be more obvious than that?

132
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,980
So I want to think in
those terms of a mortgage,

133
00:07:56,981 --> 00:07:59,110
that star that always has a dollar left.

134
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:04,470
So suppose at any stage you had
a dollars left in your mortgage,

135
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:09,070
what would the, your remaining
balance was one, what would you,

136
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,010
so let's say at any node,

137
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:13,490
okay,

138
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,290
Nino, let's ask the
question. What is the value

139
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,410
of $1 of remaining balance?

140
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,170
Okay, so if you start at a hundred and
you haven't prepaid here, you've got B,

141
00:08:34,171 --> 00:08:37,620
$2, of course, whatever
the value of that is,

142
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,680
you take divided by B two,
that's the value of $1.

143
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:42,090
So I'm just going to figure out the doll,

144
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,800
the value of $1 for balance
and want to call that.

145
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,940
Um, W let's say, I'll call that w. Okay.

146
00:08:50,941 --> 00:08:55,550
If some node s so where am
I? I'm in some node. Um,

147
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,260
okay.

148
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,960
Uh, I'm in some node in this
interest rate tree, right?

149
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:04,370
Here's our interest rate tree and I'm
anywhere just here and I'm doing backward

150
00:09:04,371 --> 00:09:06,410
induction.
So for all success or nodes,

151
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:09,410
I figured out what $1 remaining balances.

152
00:09:09,411 --> 00:09:14,210
And let's say it's in period
one, two, three, four,

153
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:18,590
five. So I'm in period five. B Five. Okay.

154
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,680
So what is the remaining balance
at this? No, which I call ass.

155
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,000
So at some node right there
of, oh no, I've lost it. Uh,

156
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,790
so w s is going to be what?

157
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:36,320
It's going to be the minimum
of one.

158
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:41,350
You could just pay it if you wanted to
or you could wait one over one plus r s.

159
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,720
Okay. And then what would you
have to do? You would have to

160
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,530
make your payment. Well,
what's your payment?

161
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:56,660
The payment is this 8.88,
but divided by

162
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,440
B five.

163
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,430
Okay. Plus, um,

164
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,750
the remaining value
remaining balance of uh,

165
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,310
yeah,

166
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,430
of a dollar.
So B six

167
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,590
over be five times the remainder

168
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:31,130
times a w s up. Okay. Now why,

169
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,650
why is this right?
I hope it is right by the way.

170
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,680
Should have thought of
this a little before. Um,

171
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:38,950
okay.

172
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,650
Okay, well typically I,
so I've just taken the,

173
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,980
so this is the remainder of $1 left.
Okay.

174
00:10:44,981 --> 00:10:47,110
So if I divide by B five here,

175
00:10:47,111 --> 00:10:49,240
I'm not going to have a
remaining balance of the six.

176
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:52,330
I'm going to have a remaining
balance of B six Overby five.

177
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,960
So if I started with a dollar
of remaining balance, okay,

178
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,410
then I know that in the next period
I'm going to have B six or B,

179
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:05,260
$5 of remaining balance left.

180
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,900
Just didn't sound too
convincing by the way. Um,

181
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,110
okay. Well that's right. And that
happens with probability a half.

182
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,920
And then with the other probability a
half plus I make the payment but I go down

183
00:11:27,431 --> 00:11:28,270
instead of up.

184
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,853
Okay.

185
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,900
And so I have B six over five.
Uh,

186
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,710
but I have w s down

187
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,510
and that's also times a half.
Okay.

188
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:46,370
So either I pay off my
rape remaining dollar or I,

189
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:51,050
uh, end up with this
many dollars, you know,

190
00:11:51,051 --> 00:11:54,130
assuming I had a $1 remaining balance,
okay,

191
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:58,300
I'm either going to pay it
off the remaining balance
or I'm going to have this

192
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,660
much left next period and adult
remaining balances is going to be that.

193
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,093
Okay?

194
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,040
Okay.
So that's it.

195
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,360
So I know now by working this forwards,
I can always tell backwards.

196
00:12:11,361 --> 00:12:13,820
I can tell what a dollar
at the beginning is worth.

197
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,540
And so it's exactly the same calculation
I did before except I'm talking about a

198
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:18,111
dollar.

199
00:12:18,111 --> 00:12:21,350
I'm always figuring out a
dollar for meaning balance
instead of the whole thing.

200
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,430
Um, present value of
Kabul with the whole case.

201
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,960
So here's present value
of a dollar is principle.

202
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,910
And so remember the present value
of a callable mortgage was 98.8.

203
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:36,740
Here are the present value of a dollar.
Figure it out that way is 0.98.

204
00:12:36,741 --> 00:12:38,780
Obviously it's divided by a hundred,

205
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:43,850
but the key is that now you can see just
by looking at it where the ones are is

206
00:12:43,851 --> 00:12:48,200
where the guy decided to prepay. Okay.
So it's the same thing as before.

207
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:52,620
But you see before you couldn't tell
very easily from the numbers. Uh,

208
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,050
when I did the hundred,
sorry,

209
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,190
I'm going to make it before when I did
the present value with the hundred,

210
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,760
all these numbers were 98 to [inaudible]
97. So I mean, where is he prepaid?

211
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:03,620
It's hard to tell where the prepayment is.

212
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,560
If I do it all in terms of a
dollar of remaining balance,

213
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,250
then just by looking at the screen, I
can tell where the guy prepaid. Okay.

214
00:13:10,251 --> 00:13:14,030
Because there ones there. So I know where
he's prepaid, wherever the ones are,

215
00:13:14,031 --> 00:13:17,840
that means he's prepaid. So I can tell
very easily what he did. All right.

216
00:13:17,841 --> 00:13:21,590
That's the only purpose of, of doing
this somewhat the same calculation,

217
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:24,260
this dilemma, trickier way. So
if you think about it a second,

218
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,120
you see I've just divided by,

219
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,750
I've always reduced things to what
if you had a dollar left? All right?

220
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,500
So this tells us what to do
when the guy should prepaid,

221
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,470
when he shouldn't prepay.

222
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:38,060
So if you're now in the world
looking at what's happening,

223
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,470
you can find the historical
record of how people have prepaid.

224
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:47,780
So let's just look at the
historical record for example. Um,

225
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,460
here, if you can see this, uh, uh, this,

226
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:54,440
this is blown up as big as it goes,

227
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,190
okay?

228
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:56,431
Okay?

229
00:13:56,431 --> 00:14:01,431
So this is what you might see as
the historical record of percentage

230
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,500
prepayments,
um,

231
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:10,650
annualized from 86 to 99.
Say,

232
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:11,701
okay?

233
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:16,701
So you noticed that they are very low
here and then they get to be very high and

234
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,810
then they get low again and
then they get high again.

235
00:14:18,811 --> 00:14:21,240
So why do you think that happened?
So what is this?

236
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:24,540
This is prepayments for
particular mortgage,

237
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:29,570
8% you take all the people in the country
who started in 1986 with 8% mortgages.

238
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,580
There's a huge crowd of those,

239
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:34,980
cause that was about what the
mortgage rate was that year.

240
00:14:34,981 --> 00:14:39,300
So a huge collection of people got these
mortgages in 86 and you keep track of

241
00:14:39,301 --> 00:14:43,230
what percentage of them prepaid
really every month. But you're right,

242
00:14:43,231 --> 00:14:45,960
the annualized rate and
then this is the record.

243
00:14:45,961 --> 00:14:49,830
So why do you think it changed
so dramatically like that?
What's the explanation?

244
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,780
What, okay, looks like the stock market,

245
00:14:53,781 --> 00:14:56,810
but I assure you the stock market
had almost nothing to do with it.

246
00:14:56,811 --> 00:15:00,500
Why would prepayments be so low and
then be so high then below than be high?

247
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:04,190
What do you think was happening?
Interest rate. We just did that.

248
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,980
We just solved out. That was the
whole point of what we were doing.

249
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:10,010
So you tell me,
what do you think happened in 93?

250
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,910
This is September [inaudible] 93.
I don't know if you can read that.

251
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:15,140
What do you think was going on then?

252
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:18,220
Okay,

253
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,410
interest rates got low.
Exactly.

254
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:24,880
So you may not remember this
because you were barely born in, uh,

255
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:29,140
in the early nineties there was a
recession and then the government cut the

256
00:15:29,141 --> 00:15:33,490
interest rates. Uh, in the 90s, the early
nineties, there was a recession. And the,

257
00:15:33,491 --> 00:15:36,250
and the government kept cutting interest
rates further and further and further,

258
00:15:36,251 --> 00:15:39,250
it was this huge decline in interest
rates through the early nineties.

259
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,790
And so what happened?
All these people who,

260
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,760
who in in 86 who had these 8% mortgages,

261
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:49,120
the new interest rates were lower.
And so they all prepaid,

262
00:15:49,121 --> 00:15:52,480
you've got the shocking amount of
prepayment. Okay. So this graph,

263
00:15:52,481 --> 00:15:55,330
which seems sort of, you know, surprising,

264
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:58,720
and it looks like the stock market
turns out to have nothing to do with the

265
00:15:58,721 --> 00:16:03,720
stock market. It has to do with
where the interest rates are.

266
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:07,230
Well, do you think interest
rates explain everything? Um,

267
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:13,410
no. What else could you notice
about the, uh, um, escape?

268
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,970
Okay. What else could you notice?
What else do you think that, uh,

269
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,120
what else have we learned here
by doing these calculations?

270
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,251
Okay.
Well,

271
00:16:23,251 --> 00:16:28,170
what we've learned so far
is that if the people are,

272
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,950
you know, if, if the interest
rates and the economy or at 6%,

273
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,210
that's where they started.

274
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:38,020
I remember we said they started at
6% or 16% volatility, which is, Oh,

275
00:16:38,021 --> 00:16:40,640
here I had 20% volatility.
Okay. It doesn't matter. I mean,

276
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:45,510
that's a plausible amount of volatility.
Little High, but okay. That volatility,

277
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,673
the um,

278
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,360
mortgage rate of 8% is not going to give
a value of 100 it's going to cheat the

279
00:16:54,661 --> 00:16:58,990
bank. If the homeowners are acting
rationally, the bank, you know,

280
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,860
the bank could get 120 if the
people weren't acting rationally,

281
00:17:01,861 --> 00:17:04,470
they were just never caught,
never exercising their option.

282
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:08,220
If they're exercising their option
optimally, the thing was only worth 8%.

283
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,460
Now I told you at that time the interest
rates should have been around seven and

284
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:16,110
a half percent, not 8%. Given these
a 6% interest rate in the economy,

285
00:17:16,111 --> 00:17:17,940
the mortgage rate should be
seven and a half percent.

286
00:17:17,941 --> 00:17:22,260
So we deduced last time that obviously
not everybody's acting optimally. Well,

287
00:17:22,261 --> 00:17:25,170
you can tell that looking
at this, uh, diagram,

288
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,620
how do you know that not
everybody's acting APP optimally?

289
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,680
Remember these are 86 mortgages,

290
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,350
so it's everybody's taking
them out at the same time,

291
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:37,320
within a few months of each other,
the same 8% mortgage.

292
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,500
How can you tell from this graph that
they're not exercising their their option

293
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:47,660
optimally? Completely obvious. Why?

294
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,040
Just looking at it for one
second. You can say, oh,

295
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,080
these people can't be exercising their
option optimally. Why is that? Yes,

296
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,690
they should be exercising all at the same.

297
00:17:58,930 --> 00:17:59,763
Bye.

298
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,970
Okay, so as he says, we've just done the
calculation with those ones and Zeros.

299
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,350
I told you when the right time to exercise
the option is so everybody's got the

300
00:18:09,351 --> 00:18:11,780
same circumstance.
Every single person,

301
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,380
if all they're trying to do is minimize
the present value of their payments,

302
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,990
they should all be
prepaying at the same time.

303
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:22,040
Here you see that very few people are
prepaying but you know it's getting up to

304
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,170
almost 10% so these people are,

305
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,470
so probably this is a
stupid time to prepay,

306
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:32,330
but the point is there are still 10%
of them are prepaying and over here,

307
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,950
one presumably you ought to
prepay in the entire year, right?

308
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:38,900
They have 12 chances during the year.

309
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:43,940
It takes them an entire year and only
60% of them have have figured out that

310
00:18:43,941 --> 00:18:45,890
they should prepay.
Okay,

311
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,390
so you know they're not acting optimally
so that just from that graph that would

312
00:18:50,391 --> 00:18:52,880
tell you and you have
further evidence of that,

313
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,450
that's evidence that they aren't
acting optimally. Furthermore,

314
00:18:56,451 --> 00:19:00,890
you have evidence that the banks don't
expect them to be act acting optimally

315
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,220
because the banks aren't charging
them eight or 9% interest,

316
00:19:04,221 --> 00:19:08,360
which is what they would need to pay to
get the thing worth a hundred they're

317
00:19:08,361 --> 00:19:10,850
charging them seven and
a half percent interest,

318
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,710
which for the optimal prepare is worth
much less than a hundred to the bank.

319
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,120
So the banks wouldn't do that.

320
00:19:17,121 --> 00:19:19,610
They would just go out of business if
they did something stupid like that,

321
00:19:19,611 --> 00:19:23,240
they wouldn't do that unless they thought
that the homeowners weren't acting,

322
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,780
at least not all of them acting optimally.
Okay,

323
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,900
so suppose you had to predict how people
are going to act in the future and you

324
00:19:33,861 --> 00:19:36,290
want it to trade on that.
How, what would you do?

325
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:37,790
Okay.

326
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:41,540
How would you think about predicting it?
So this is the data that you have.

327
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:45,830
What would you go, what would you do?
You have this data, these are 8% things.

328
00:19:45,831 --> 00:19:50,210
You also have 9% mortgages issued the
year before and then maybe a year before

329
00:19:50,211 --> 00:19:53,620
that there were eight and a half percent
interest and you have that history and

330
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,510
you've got all these different pools
and all these different histories.

331
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,940
How would you think about
figuring out, uh, a prepayment?

332
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:07,710
How would you predict prepayments?
Well,

333
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,650
the way economists,
macro economists,

334
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,120
at least in the old days used to
make predictions. They would say,

335
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,490
hmm, the first quarter looks pretty
good. Now what are they predicting now?

336
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:24,750
Now they're saying unemployment is
probably going to keep rising for the next

337
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:28,710
quarter or two, uh, till
well until the next year.

338
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,820
But at that point,

339
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:33,900
things are going to turn around and
we expect the economy to get stronger,

340
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,220
come out of its recession and unemployment
should gradually improve from its

341
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:38,671
high,

342
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:43,650
which we expect will be 10 and a half
percent to something back down to 6% by

343
00:20:43,651 --> 00:20:48,130
the end of 2011. That's more or
less the economist prediction. Now,

344
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,310
can you make a prediction
like that about prepayments?

345
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:53,200
Would it make sense to make
a prediction about that?

346
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:56,890
Why is that an utterly
stupid kind of prediction?

347
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,220
What is the essence of good prediction?

348
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,460
If you wanted to predict something and
you are going to lose a lot of money if

349
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:07,750
your prediction was wrong,

350
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:12,820
how would you refine your prediction
compared to what I just gave as a sample

351
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:14,550
prediction.
Yup.

352
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,370
You have a number of
scenarios and what exactly.

353
00:21:18,371 --> 00:21:22,540
So what he said is if you're even
the slightest bit sophisticated,

354
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,410
you're not going to make a bald,
you know,

355
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,270
noncontingent prediction.
You know,

356
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:30,610
things are going to get
worse the next two quarters,

357
00:21:30,611 --> 00:21:33,490
then they're going to start getting
better. Then they're going to, you know,

358
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:37,180
you know t you know things are going
to get as well as they're going to get

359
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:39,670
after two years.
You'll solve the problem after two years.

360
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:44,500
You know what happens if another war
breaks out in Iraq? What if Iran, Brahms,

361
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:49,390
Israel. What if, uh, uh, you know, there's
another crash and commercial real estate.

362
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,810
You know, how could that prediction
possibly turn out to be true?

363
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,570
It's a sure thing. It's going to
be wrong. It's just impossible.

364
00:21:55,571 --> 00:21:58,960
That's going to be right because the
guy making the prediction has made no

365
00:21:58,961 --> 00:22:01,000
contingencies built in his prediction.

366
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,670
You know that guy's making a
prediction for free minimum.

367
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,670
Someone's maybe paying him to hear him,
but he's not going to be panelized.

368
00:22:06,671 --> 00:22:07,780
There was prediction is wrong.

369
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,570
No one in their right mind
would make such a prediction.

370
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:15,280
So the first thing you should do in
predicting prepayments is to realize that

371
00:22:15,281 --> 00:22:17,860
you've got a tree of possible futures.

372
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,470
And given this tree of possible futures,

373
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:24,400
you're going to predict different
prepayments depending on what,

374
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,680
where are you going on the tree?
Okay,

375
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:30,760
so you see prediction is not a simple one,
one event,

376
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:35,080
it's not a a one shot thing
just as he so aptly put it.

377
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:39,490
It's a many scenario thing. You have
to predict over many, many scenarios.

378
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,640
What do you think will happen? And
that makes your prediction much better.

379
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:45,940
Because of course if there is a war in
Iraq and if there is a catastrophe and

380
00:22:45,941 --> 00:22:50,941
Afghanistan and if Iran does bomb
Israel and if the commercial real estate

381
00:22:50,951 --> 00:22:52,090
market collapses,

382
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,810
things are going to be a lot worse than
this original guys prediction. Okay,

383
00:22:55,811 --> 00:22:57,940
so why not?
I mean everybody knows that.

384
00:22:57,941 --> 00:23:02,590
So why not make the prediction
more sensible? Okay, so the art,

385
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,400
so on Wall Street, that's what
everybody's done for 20 years now.

386
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:09,130
They haven't done it for 30 years.

387
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,190
It's just 20 years that
they've been doing that. Okay.

388
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:17,191
So when I got to kidder Peabody in 1990
they were making these ones scenario

389
00:23:17,621 --> 00:23:22,090
predictions. So we had to change. And
so I, I, you know, I, it's a long story,

390
00:23:22,091 --> 00:23:26,770
which I'll tell maybe Sunday night
I ended up in charge of the research

391
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:30,220
department. And so we made, you know,
other firms were doing this already.

392
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:32,140
We made scenario predictions.
Okay,

393
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,670
so now what kind of scenario predictions
are you going to make when you make

394
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,340
contingent predictions
through an awful lot of them,

395
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,990
you can't even write them all down.

396
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,950
So what you have to do is
you have to have a model.

397
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:49,640
So what kind of model should
you, uh, should you have? Okay,

398
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:50,201
well I'll,

399
00:23:50,201 --> 00:23:54,260
I'll tell you now what the standard guys
were doing on Wall Street at the time.

400
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:59,190
They were saying,
here's interest rate.

401
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:03,750
Sorry. Here's the present value of a
mortgage is the present value of a call.

402
00:24:03,751 --> 00:24:07,890
We'll mortgage present value of $1 to
principals. So realistic p payments.

403
00:24:07,891 --> 00:24:12,630
So if we go over here,
we'll see that people said,

404
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,630
look, from this graph, it's clear.

405
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:19,740
They would say that when interest
rates went down, people prepay more.

406
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,450
So why don't we have a function that,

407
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,530
uh, looks like this? Let's say the prep.

408
00:24:28,531 --> 00:24:30,440
So prepay,

409
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,900
that's the percentage,

410
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:39,150
percentage of remaining
balance that is paid.

411
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,010
Paid off. Okay, so,

412
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:47,520
so what does that mean? Remember
after you've made your coupon payment,

413
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:49,800
you have a remaining
balance. You know, B five,

414
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,900
you could pay all of it or none of
it, or half of it. So the, the prepay,

415
00:24:54,901 --> 00:24:59,520
the prepay is what percentage of the
B five. That's just after you've paid,

416
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:04,620
right? So B two let's do that one B two
just after you've paid 8.88 the remaining

417
00:25:04,621 --> 00:25:06,240
balances now been reduced to be too.

418
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:10,800
You could in addition to the 8.88 pay
off all of that be to typically some

419
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:14,760
people who are alert and think it's a
good time to prepay will pay all of me to

420
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:19,950
others will pay none of B two so if you
aggregate over the whole collection of

421
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:24,480
people, the prepaid percentage is a
lot of the sums of all their be twos.

422
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,800
What percentage of them are going to
pay off s so we look at the aggregate

423
00:25:28,801 --> 00:25:31,020
prepayment,
that's the old fashioned way.

424
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,680
And we say what percentage of
the remaining balances paid off?

425
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:39,240
And typically what? So that you'd
make a function like this. You'd say,

426
00:25:39,241 --> 00:25:44,241
well prepay might equal 10% why am I
picking 10% so if you go back to this

427
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:49,770
picture,
you see that prepayments were

428
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:58,570
prepayments, you know, seem to be around
10% when nothing's happening. Okay,

429
00:25:58,571 --> 00:26:03,070
so you say 10% plus maybe you're
going to get some more prepayments.

430
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:08,320
Okay. So you might write, well I just
wrote down a function plus the men,

431
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:15,260
the men say of point 60 because it never
seems to get over 60% if you look at

432
00:26:15,401 --> 00:26:20,110
that because he never gets over
60% really? So the men of 60

433
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:24,280
and 15 times

434
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:32,730
15 times the Max of zero and m
minus our of s minus sigma over one,

435
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:42,940
three, three. Yeah. That would
be a kind of prepayment function.

436
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,640
What does this say? It says
you pay, it says, okay,

437
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:52,500
what happens you're normally going to pay.
So this is this whole function here.

438
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:58,080
So I should write, this is 0.1 plus if
you can read, can you see that over there?

439
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:02,700
Maybe not. So, um, this plus 0.1, okay,

440
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:07,701
so there's a baseline of 10% and
if the interest rate is high,

441
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,010
so the interest rate is
above the mortgage rate.

442
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:14,250
No one else is going to prepaid because
this is going to be a negative number

443
00:27:14,251 --> 00:27:18,570
and this will be zero. So you're
just going to do, um, 0.1%.

444
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,183
Okay.

445
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,930
On the other hand is the interest rate
gets low and falls far enough below the

446
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:28,020
mortgage rate. People are going
to say to themselves, a Ha,

447
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:31,620
I have a big incentive to prepay now
maybe think interest rates have gone down

448
00:27:31,621 --> 00:27:34,920
so far, I can no longer hope they're going
to go back up above the mortgage rate.

449
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,710
I should stop.
I should start prepaying more.

450
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:41,610
So more people are going to prepay and
this thing is going to go up, you know,

451
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:45,390
and I've just multiply it by
some constant. Okay. And uh,

452
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,040
but it will never go up more than 60%
that's what this function says. And sigma,

453
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,300
this is the volatility AACM all right,

454
00:27:54,301 --> 00:27:55,590
so let's just leave that aside.

455
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:59,820
So there is a prepayment function that
seems to sort of capture what's going on.

456
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,940
It's usually around 10%
when there's no incentive,

457
00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:06,840
it never gets above 60% but as the
incentive to prepay is interest rates get

458
00:28:06,841 --> 00:28:10,290
lower and the incentive to repaying
pieces more and more people prepay.

459
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,510
That's kind of the idea.
All right.

460
00:28:12,511 --> 00:28:16,050
And then you would fit
fancier curves than that.

461
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:20,520
You would look at an minus. Rt and
you would fit a curve, you know,

462
00:28:20,521 --> 00:28:23,700
that looks like this. So if there's just
a little bit of incentive to prepay,

463
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:25,530
the rates were a little bit
lower than the mortgage rate.

464
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,150
Nobody does it then quickly,

465
00:28:27,151 --> 00:28:29,640
a lot of people do it and
then they stopped doing it.

466
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:34,800
So this is like 60% and you know,
most of the time you around 10% and uh,

467
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:36,270
you know,
you're trying to fit this curve.

468
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:39,090
You'd have millions of parameters
and since you have so much data,

469
00:28:39,091 --> 00:28:41,550
you could fit parameters. Okay,
that was the old fashioned way.

470
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:45,360
And that's how people would
predict, uh, prepayments.

471
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,210
Now that's not going to turn
out to be such a great way,

472
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:50,460
but it's certainly teaches you something.

473
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,990
So let's look at what happens if you
now with those realistic prepayments,

474
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:58,990
you compute the value of a mortgage.
So the,

475
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,160
this is the prepayment that you'd
get for the different rates.

476
00:29:02,161 --> 00:29:05,650
And so you can see that
as the rates go down, um,

477
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:10,830
as the rates go down, the total
prepayment is going up. And by the way,

478
00:29:10,831 --> 00:29:15,450
it's more than 60% because you've got
this 10% added to the 60% so the most,

479
00:29:15,451 --> 00:29:18,480
it could be a 70% which it hits over here.

480
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,140
So you get 70% is the maximum prepayments.

481
00:29:22,141 --> 00:29:27,141
And you know as interest rates get higher
it no one prepays except the 10% of

482
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:30,720
guys. Now, by the way, why are
people prepaying over here?

483
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,730
Even when the rates are so high,

484
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,270
it's because some people are moving or
they're getting divorced and they have to

485
00:29:36,271 --> 00:29:37,170
sell their house.

486
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:41,410
So obviously you're going to get some
prepayments no matter what people have to

487
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:42,244
prepay.

488
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:47,140
And why is it that people never prepay
more than 60% historically or 70% because

489
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:50,800
not everybody pays attention.
Now I called them the dumb guys last time,

490
00:29:50,801 --> 00:29:53,980
but as I said, you know, I
probably fit into that category.

491
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:56,020
It's people who are distracted
and doing other things,

492
00:29:56,021 --> 00:29:58,540
so just not paying attention. And
so they don't realize, you know,

493
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,880
they'll know what's going on if they
don't realize they should be prepaying.

494
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,210
So as interest rates go down,
more people prepay interest rate goes up,

495
00:30:04,211 --> 00:30:05,200
less people prepay.

496
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:09,820
And if you did some historical thing
and you don't figure it out the right

497
00:30:09,821 --> 00:30:12,260
parameters, you'd get a
prepayment function. So you know,

498
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,200
how did I figure out this was 15,

499
00:30:14,201 --> 00:30:18,820
how do I figure out this was 0.6 why
should I divide this by one 33 what?

500
00:30:18,821 --> 00:30:20,920
Sigma. Okay. Once you
get those parameters,

501
00:30:20,921 --> 00:30:25,120
historically you now have
a weld determined, uh,

502
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,730
behavior rule,
what people are going to prepay.

503
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:32,080
And from that you can figure out what the
prices are of any mortgage by backward

504
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:35,040
induction. So how would you do
it again, by backward induction?

505
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,690
The same way we always did it over here.

506
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:44,260
Okay. What, what, what would you do over
here? How would you change this rule?

507
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:58,690
Well, you would just be feeding in
the prepayment function. Okay, so,

508
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,220
so what would the prepayment function be?
Well,

509
00:31:09,221 --> 00:31:11,260
people wouldn't be doing a minimum here,
right?

510
00:31:11,261 --> 00:31:16,210
They're not deciding whether or not to
prepay their just prepaying. So this is,

511
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,960
Oh, let's get rid of that. There
are prepaying. So some of them are,

512
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:23,680
so this is the value of a
dollars left of principle.

513
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:27,190
So some of them are prepaying
and that's the function.

514
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:30,670
So prepay and that depends
on what node you're at.

515
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,310
And here it says what fraction,

516
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,340
what percentage of the remaining
balances being prepaid.

517
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,230
So that tells you that rule,

518
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:42,850
who's prepaying and then with the rest
of the money that's going on until next

519
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:45,610
time,
one minus that same thing,

520
00:31:45,611 --> 00:31:50,200
one minus prepay times
exactly what we had before.

521
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,670
Okay. So this part of the
dollar got prepaid immediately.

522
00:31:57,671 --> 00:32:00,160
So that's the cash that
went to the mortgage holder.

523
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,990
The rest of the cash got save till next
time. And here's what happens to it.

524
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:11,600
Okay, you have to make your coupon,
then you have a remaining balance.

525
00:32:11,601 --> 00:32:13,490
And then whatever's gonna
happen is gonna happen.

526
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,600
Okay? So that's the uh,
okay. So doing that by,

527
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,480
so you'll study this and you'll figure
out, I'm sure it will, you know,

528
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:27,380
it takes a little bit of
effort to see that through.

529
00:32:27,381 --> 00:32:29,420
But with half an hour staring at it,

530
00:32:29,421 --> 00:32:32,480
you're all understand how this works
and you'll read it in a spreadsheet.

531
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:37,160
So you can figure out the value of every
of a mortgage. Okay? So that's, that's,

532
00:32:37,161 --> 00:32:40,490
uh, you know, you'd a
value of a mortgage. Okay.

533
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:43,640
And now we could start doing experiments
by changing the parameters and see how

534
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:47,480
the mortgage works. Now, before
I do that, I want to say that,

535
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:51,350
that there's a better way
to do this. Okay? I mean,

536
00:32:51,351 --> 00:32:54,450
maybe these numbers are estimated
were interest rates didn't.

537
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:58,640
What's a better way of doing it? So how,
how would I, how did I do it at Ellington?

538
00:32:58,641 --> 00:33:02,990
How did we, I mean, at kidder Peabody,
how did we predict prepayments?

539
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,910
What's another way of looking at,
at the prepayments and why you could,

540
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:12,320
so let me, let me, let me tell you
something that's missing. Suppose that,

541
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,100
um, I used to ask people
who wanted to work at,

542
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,210
at a kidder Peabody or Ellington,
the following little simple puzzle.

543
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,490
And most of the genius mathematicians
always got this answer wrong. Um,

544
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,070
of course we hired them anyway,
but they'd always get this wrong.

545
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:32,630
So the question is, suppose you've
got a group of people like this,

546
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:33,740
okay?

547
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:38,180
And you figure out what the value of the
mortgages and interest rates have been

548
00:33:38,181 --> 00:33:42,770
constant all of his time. Let's suppose
for one month, interest rates shoot up,

549
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,950
shoot down, interest rates
collapsed and half the pool,

550
00:33:45,951 --> 00:33:50,780
60% of the pool disappears. So now
you've only got 40% of the people left.

551
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:51,860
You have before.

552
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:56,420
And then interest rates return to exactly
where they were to begin with. Okay.

553
00:33:56,421 --> 00:34:01,421
Should the pool that's left be worth 40%
of the pool that you had just here or

554
00:34:02,961 --> 00:34:07,961
more than 40% or less than 40% so
remember you had a hundred people here.

555
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,850
You're the bank who's lent them the money.

556
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,130
You know your value in the
mortgage payments they're
going gonna make to you and

557
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,950
you're getting a certain
amount of money from them.

558
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:21,260
60% of them suddenly disappeared
in one month leaving 40 left.

559
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:24,110
But now interest rates are back
exactly where they were before.

560
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,800
Is the value of the mortgage starting
here with the 40% pool worth 40% of what

561
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,770
it was originally more than 40% or
less than 40% what do you think?

562
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,353
Yes.

563
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,790
More than 40%

564
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:47,530
exactly.
So that's an incredibly important point.

565
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,840
It's called the opposite
of adverse selection.

566
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:53,350
Every one of these events is
selecting the people left,

567
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:57,250
not adversely. What's the, not perversely,

568
00:34:57,251 --> 00:35:01,330
what's the opposite of
adverse favorably to you.

569
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:04,570
So the guys who are left are all losers,
but that's what you want to deal with.

570
00:35:04,571 --> 00:35:07,710
You don't want to trade with the geniuses.
You want to trade with the guy.

571
00:35:07,711 --> 00:35:08,830
He's not paying any attention.

572
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,280
So the guys left are the people who are
never going to prepay or hardly ever

573
00:35:12,281 --> 00:35:14,980
going to prepay. And so
it's much better. Now,

574
00:35:14,981 --> 00:35:19,000
this function doesn't capture that at all,
right?

575
00:35:19,001 --> 00:35:20,230
It doesn't say anything.

576
00:35:20,231 --> 00:35:23,170
It just says you're a prepayments
depending on where you are.

577
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,980
So you know whether you were here or here,
uh,

578
00:35:26,981 --> 00:35:28,690
you're going to get the same prepayment.

579
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,450
But we know that that's not
going to be the case. In fact,

580
00:35:31,451 --> 00:35:35,320
it's clear that over here there must
have been a much bigger incentive than

581
00:35:35,321 --> 00:35:37,530
there was over there.
So the prepayments are the same.

582
00:35:37,531 --> 00:35:41,490
But actually interest rates here, we're
vastly lower than interest rates there.

583
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,300
Okay. So, so this is not
such a good function.

584
00:35:45,301 --> 00:35:47,280
So how would you improve?

585
00:35:47,281 --> 00:35:51,390
What would you do to take into account
this adverse selection and actually pro

586
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:54,900
verse selection,
what is the opposite of adverse?

587
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,380
Okay, well I'll do that. Okay. So how
would you, what would you think to do?

588
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:07,030
You know, your whole livelihood depends
on it. You know, there are millions,

589
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:10,120
trillions of dollars at stake here.
You've got a model prepayments correctly.

590
00:36:10,121 --> 00:36:11,890
So how would you think of doing this?

591
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:15,610
Just giving you some sense of what a
hedge fund does or what anyone on in this

592
00:36:15,611 --> 00:36:20,290
market would have to do. Well, most
of them did this. Of course they got,

593
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,820
okay,
so what would you do?

594
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,600
Yup,

595
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:28,600
I old Morgan because the market is
probably over underestimating their map.

596
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,720
What you would buy it up
when? Right after, right here.

597
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,950
You'd buy it up right there.
Okay,

598
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:43,840
but what model would you
use to predict prepayments?

599
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:47,100
Not this one. What? So what would,
what would you do to do well?

600
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:49,240
How would you imagine doing it?

601
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:53,410
You'd imagine making a model just like
your intuition. So what does that mean?

602
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:54,244
Doing

603
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,220
that? One's asking you to
run a research department,

604
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:03,470
make a model of forecasting prepayments.

605
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,960
All the data you have is
aggregate data like that.

606
00:37:05,961 --> 00:37:09,320
You can't observe individual homeowners
and those days they wouldn't give you

607
00:37:09,321 --> 00:37:11,870
the information.
I'll explain all that Sunday night.

608
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,320
So this is the kind of data you have.
You know what the average,

609
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,950
what the whole group of
people is doing every year,

610
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,870
but what would you do to build the model?

611
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,133
Yeah,

612
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:30,410
adverse selection is very important. Or
Pro verse election. I, I'm really free.

613
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:33,550
It's embarrassing. I don't remember
the word. Favorable selection.

614
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,700
Very important thing. So how would
you capture that in your model?

615
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,393
Yup.

616
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,993
Okay,

617
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:47,170
so maybe another thing you could
do and that it's going to start,

618
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:48,490
what if you,

619
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:53,110
instead of having having this function
that says what the aggregate is going to

620
00:37:53,111 --> 00:37:56,890
do, all the data's aggregates, all you
can do is test against aggregate data.

621
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:00,610
But suppose you were you, you,
you said, okay, the world,

622
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,260
all we can see is the aggregate,

623
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:06,370
but the people really acting or
individuals acting, not the aggregate.

624
00:38:06,371 --> 00:38:08,380
It's the sum of individual activities.

625
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:13,210
So what we should do now is have
different kinds of people. Okay. So,

626
00:38:13,211 --> 00:38:17,680
oh Gosh, sorry. It wasn't,
they are already, um,

627
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:23,190
so let's go back to where we
were before. Okay. So realistic.

628
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,193
MMM.

629
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:31,390
Okay. What you ought to do
is you ought to say, well 8%.

630
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:37,060
Okay. Remember we had two kinds of people.
You've already got two kinds of people.

631
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:40,960
Sorry.
We've got these guys,

632
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,890
the guys who never call. So there are
people you know, that's a kind of person.

633
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,000
And suppose you go down here and you have
the people who are optimally prepaying.

634
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,410
Suppose you imagine that half the people
were optimally prepaying and half the

635
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:55,420
people never prepaid.
Well,

636
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,160
would that explain this
favorable selection? Absolutely.

637
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:03,310
It would explain it because when
you went through your little tree,

638
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,430
anyone here and here and here and here,

639
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:12,240
by the time you got down here,
all those people, all the,

640
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,070
all the optimal prepares,
they're all prepaying.

641
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:19,210
So you start off with half
optimal guys and half asleep guys,

642
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,630
once you get down here,
all the optimal guys have disappeared.

643
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,340
And the pool of what's left is all asleep.

644
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,550
So of course the pool is worth
lunch more here, you know,

645
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:29,980
then given the interest rates
and it was over here. In fact,

646
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:33,370
if it goes back then again to hear,

647
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:38,650
you know where it was before. Sorry,
that's same line. If it goes back to here,

648
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,220
if I had done this right and all I've
got to go back twice here and then here.

649
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:46,120
So once it goes back to here, if
it goes here, here, here and here,

650
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:51,610
okay, then the pool is going to be much
more valuable here than it started there.

651
00:39:51,611 --> 00:39:52,690
They're half as many people,

652
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:56,230
but it's worth much more than
half of what it was there. Okay.

653
00:39:56,231 --> 00:40:01,150
So the way to do this is to break.
So then you're looking at the individuals,

654
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:03,760
you're saying one class
of people's very smart,

655
00:40:03,761 --> 00:40:06,700
the other class of people or one
class of people's very alert,

656
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,920
a much better word,
one class of people's very alert,

657
00:40:08,921 --> 00:40:12,370
one class of people's very unlearned.
And as you go through the tree,

658
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,150
the alert people are going to disappear
faster than the non alert people.

659
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:19,480
And that's why you're going to have a
favorable selection of people who's left

660
00:40:19,481 --> 00:40:20,980
in the pool. Okay. Well,

661
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:25,120
of course there's no extremes of
perfectly rational or perfectly,

662
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:28,120
uh, you know, asleep in the economy.

663
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:32,860
So what you can do is you can make people
in between, you can have people who,

664
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:36,490
how do you make them in between?
Well, suppose that, for example,

665
00:40:36,491 --> 00:40:39,730
I only did one thing.
Suppose it's costly to prepay.

666
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:41,260
Some people just say to themselves,
you know,

667
00:40:41,261 --> 00:40:44,980
I'm gonna have to take a whole day off
of work. I'm not going to write my paper.

668
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,310
I might lose some business that
I was going to do that day.

669
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:51,540
Whole Bunch of stuff I'm losing.
So unless I think you know,

670
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:54,640
I'm going to subtract that, the,
you know, I'm not going to prepay,

671
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:59,080
not gonna even think about doing it unless
I can get at least a certain benefit

672
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,610
from having done it.
Okay.

673
00:41:00,611 --> 00:41:04,690
So you can add a cost of prepaying and
people aren't going to prepay unless the

674
00:41:04,691 --> 00:41:09,691
gain that they have by prepaying exceeds
the cost of doing the prepayment.

675
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:14,020
So to take the simplest case,
let's suppose very active,

676
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,520
nevermind the thinking and all that.

677
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:19,570
The very act of prepaying going to
the bank literally costs you money.

678
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,430
So if you have,
you know,

679
00:41:21,431 --> 00:41:25,000
a value of if the thing is a
hundred and you can prepay,

680
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:29,230
know if you do your calculations and don't
prepay today it's worth 98 and if you

681
00:41:29,231 --> 00:41:34,231
prepaid today the remaining balances 94
you're $4 but if the cost of prepayment

682
00:41:35,391 --> 00:41:37,040
is five you're still not going to do it.

683
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:41,420
So you get a guy with a high cost of
prepaying and infinite cost of prepaying,

684
00:41:41,421 --> 00:41:43,280
he's going to look like
he's totally an alert.

685
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:47,150
A guy with zero cost of paying is going
to look like he's totally alert. Okay?

686
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:49,660
So you can have gradations of a,
of,

687
00:41:49,661 --> 00:41:53,120
of a rationality and you can
have different dimensions.

688
00:41:53,121 --> 00:41:55,550
So you can have costs of prepaying

689
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,390
and you can have alertness.

690
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:03,290
What's the percentage of time you're
actually paying attention that month?

691
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:06,620
What fraction of the month do
you actually pay attention?

692
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:10,580
And you can have a distribution of people,
different costs and different alert,

693
00:42:10,581 --> 00:42:11,151
nces.
Okay.

694
00:42:11,151 --> 00:42:15,980
So that's the model that I built
that's a simplified for our book.

695
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:19,880
Gives you an idea. Okay. So, um,

696
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,830
here's this burnout effect that I showed
that if you take the same coupons but

697
00:42:24,831 --> 00:42:28,610
an older one rather than a, uh,
an older one that's burned out,

698
00:42:28,611 --> 00:42:30,020
we'll always prepay slower.

699
00:42:30,021 --> 00:42:33,950
So the pink one is always less than
the blue one because it went through an

700
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:36,230
opportunity to prepay.
Okay.

701
00:42:36,231 --> 00:42:40,970
So here you start with a pool
of guys on the right, okay.

702
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
On the right. And then after a
while, after time has gone down,

703
00:42:44,001 --> 00:42:48,230
a lot of them have prepaid and you'd get,
so here's alertness and costs, you know,

704
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:49,490
but after time,

705
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:54,670
so you describe a person by what is cost
of free paying is and how alert he is.

706
00:42:54,891 --> 00:42:57,170
The more alert he is and the
lower the cost of prepaying,

707
00:42:57,171 --> 00:42:58,450
the closer to rational is,

708
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:03,520
the less alert is the higher the cost of
repaying the closer to the totally dumb

709
00:43:03,621 --> 00:43:06,230
guy he is. And so you
can have a, you know,

710
00:43:06,231 --> 00:43:10,640
a whole normally distributed distribution
of people and over time those groups

711
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,680
are going to uh,

712
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:15,770
be reduced because a lot of them are
prepaying but they won't be reduced

713
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,080
symmetrically.
The low cost,

714
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,500
high alertness guys are going to disappear
a much faster and the pool's going to

715
00:43:21,501 --> 00:43:25,880
get more and more favorable
to you. Okay. And so anyway,

716
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:30,890
all you have to do is parameterize
the, the cost. You know,

717
00:43:30,891 --> 00:43:33,050
what the distribution of
people in the population,

718
00:43:33,051 --> 00:43:38,051
what the standard deviation
and a expectation of cost
is and of alertness is.

719
00:43:38,121 --> 00:43:40,140
And that tells you what this
distribution looks like.

720
00:43:40,141 --> 00:43:44,720
So you're fitting for numbers and you've
got thousands of pools and hundreds and

721
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,030
hundreds of months and
fitting for parameters.

722
00:43:47,031 --> 00:43:51,980
You can end up fitting all the data.
So look at what happens here.

723
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,850
So here's the same data. So
I just tell you, you know,

724
00:43:55,851 --> 00:43:57,680
I know that in the population,

725
00:43:57,681 --> 00:44:01,580
given what I've calculated
in the 90s there,

726
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:05,210
I know what fraction of the people
have this cost and that alertness,

727
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:08,510
what fraction of the people
are so close to, you know,

728
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:12,320
dumb that their costs are astronomical
and the alertness is tiny. What,

729
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:16,520
what fraction of the people have almost
no cost and in a very high alertness,

730
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:19,670
you know, so I'm only estimating
four parameters cause I'm
assuming it's normally

731
00:44:19,671 --> 00:44:23,360
distributed giving that fixed pool.
I have people,

732
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,260
I applied that to the beginning of every
single mortgage and I just crank out

733
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,030
what would those guys do,
you know,

734
00:44:29,031 --> 00:44:31,500
in the tree if they knew
what the volatilities were,

735
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,510
when would they decide to prepay?

736
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:37,200
And then I have to follow a scenario
out in the future. And I say,

737
00:44:37,201 --> 00:44:38,460
well along this path,

738
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,730
which guy would prepay in which guy
wouldn't prepay and what would the total

739
00:44:41,731 --> 00:44:43,440
prepayments look along that path?

740
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:47,820
And so this has generated the pink line
from the model with no knowledge of the

741
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:49,560
world except they fit those parameters.

742
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,990
And look how close it is
to what actually happened.

743
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:57,290
So it turns out that it was incredibly
easy to predict a contingently predict

744
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,790
what prepayments we're going to be and
therefore to be able to value mortgages.

745
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:05,550
Okay. And this was a secret
that not many people, you know,

746
00:45:05,551 --> 00:45:08,010
a bunch of people understood,
but not that many. Understood.

747
00:45:08,011 --> 00:45:10,680
And so for years we were
trading at our hedge fund,

748
00:45:10,681 --> 00:45:13,430
the first a kid her then at
Ellington with this ability to,

749
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:17,910
to contingently forecast
prepayments at a very high rate.

750
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:21,900
And why was it so stable?
The prediction and so reliable,

751
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:25,500
it's because the class of people
stay pretty much the same.

752
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:28,770
And every year they'd be the same
kinds of people with the same kinds of

753
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:31,410
behaviors. Some were very
alert, some are very, not alert,

754
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,140
but the distribution of types
was more or less the same.

755
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:37,830
And you could predict with pretty good
accuracy what was going to happen from

756
00:45:37,831 --> 00:45:39,450
year to year.
Of course,

757
00:45:39,451 --> 00:45:43,140
then in after 2003 or so,

758
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:47,700
the class of people started to radically
change and many more people who never

759
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:48,930
got mortgages before it got them.

760
00:45:48,931 --> 00:45:51,660
And it became much harder to
predict what they were going to do.

761
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:54,390
But so in the old days it
was pretty easy to predict.

762
00:45:54,391 --> 00:45:58,080
And why was it so easy to predict?
Because it was an agent based model.

763
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:01,670
Okay,

764
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:05,450
okay. Agent base. So by the way,
I added this volatility here.

765
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,700
So these guys who just ran regressions,

766
00:46:07,701 --> 00:46:10,010
they had to have a volatility
or something, parameters.

767
00:46:10,011 --> 00:46:14,690
So you see as volatility goes up,
the prepayments are slower. Well,

768
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:18,350
they just had to notice that and
build it right into their function.

769
00:46:18,351 --> 00:46:20,450
I didn't even have to
think of that or burnout.

770
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:22,550
None of those things did
I have to think about.

771
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:26,420
Because if you're a guy optimizing
here and volatility goes up,

772
00:46:26,421 --> 00:46:29,840
so you reset the tree so that the
interest rates can change faster,

773
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,630
the option is worth more.
So you're going to wait longer.

774
00:46:32,631 --> 00:46:35,450
You're not going to just exercise it
right away because you've got a chance,

775
00:46:35,451 --> 00:46:36,860
you know the prices will really go up.

776
00:46:36,861 --> 00:46:39,140
So you can wait a little
longer for it to wait longer.

777
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:41,570
So prepayments will slow down.
Okay.

778
00:46:41,571 --> 00:46:44,150
So all I'm saying all this is just
to say that if you have the right,

779
00:46:44,151 --> 00:46:47,840
so it's agent based,
it's a contingent predictions,

780
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:50,480
contingent predictions

781
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:56,420
in those two things together enable you
to make quite reliable predictions about

782
00:46:57,181 --> 00:47:00,810
the future if you're in a
stable environment and a,

783
00:47:00,811 --> 00:47:05,460
so what seems like a bewildering amount
of stuff turns out to be pretty easy to

784
00:47:05,461 --> 00:47:08,610
explain. Okay. So now what happens?

785
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:10,530
Okay.

786
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,660
Yeah. So do you have any
questions here or should I

787
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:15,203
yes.

788
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:27,320
Some sort of what I had to figure out
what the mean. And the variance is.

789
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,340
So how do I know?

790
00:47:28,341 --> 00:47:32,020
So there there's mean and variance of
costs and mean and variance of alertness

791
00:47:32,021 --> 00:47:35,950
to get that distribution right.
So how do I know what the population,

792
00:47:35,951 --> 00:47:38,920
so let me just put the picture up again.
Um,

793
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:46,020
okay. Here. So given, so who
are the hyper rational guys?

794
00:47:46,021 --> 00:47:49,110
They're the people with the really high
alertness up there and the really low

795
00:47:49,111 --> 00:47:52,440
cost. Although the guys
back there, there, the uh,

796
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,060
okay, they're the hyper.
Um, or maybe it was the guy.

797
00:47:58,061 --> 00:48:01,660
He's not one of these corners with
very high alertness and very low cost.

798
00:48:01,661 --> 00:48:05,710
I forgot which way the scale works.
Um, it might be going down. So anyway,

799
00:48:05,711 --> 00:48:09,820
the guys with very high alertness and
very low cost or the hyper rational people

800
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:11,350
at the other corner,

801
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:15,130
you've got the guys who have very
low alertness and very high cost.

802
00:48:15,131 --> 00:48:17,860
They're the people who you're going to
make a lot of money on if you're the bank.

803
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:22,570
So how do I know how many people
are of each type? Well, I don't,

804
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:26,500
I have to, I have to, you know,
fit this distribution. But you see,

805
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:29,470
I have so much data,
I've got this kind of curve,

806
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,150
this kind of curve I've got for
every starting year, you know,

807
00:48:34,151 --> 00:48:35,830
for the whole history.

808
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:39,430
And there are so many different interest
rates and so many different. So,

809
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:39,881
you know,

810
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:44,200
I'm applying that same population at
the beginning of every single curve and

811
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:47,920
then seeing what happens to my
prediction versus what really happened.

812
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,230
And so I can always,

813
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:53,410
so I've got thousands and thousands and
thousands of data points and only four

814
00:48:53,411 --> 00:48:54,340
parameters to fit.

815
00:48:54,341 --> 00:48:57,280
So I picked the four parameters to
fit the data as much as possible.

816
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:01,990
If I assumed everybody was perfectly
alert enough instead of that curve that I

817
00:49:01,991 --> 00:49:06,220
showed you, I put a huge crowd
here of perfectly rational people,

818
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:10,420
then I would have found that I
would've gotten prepayments, you know,

819
00:49:10,421 --> 00:49:14,470
at 100% up there and at
zero all the way over here.

820
00:49:14,471 --> 00:49:16,030
And so it wouldn't have fit that curve.

821
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:19,870
So that's how I knew that there couldn't
be that many perfectly rational people.

822
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:22,253
Okay.
Yes.

823
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:29,870
You mean how do I know cost and alertness?
Maybe there's some other factors. Yes.

824
00:49:29,871 --> 00:49:34,250
Well, okay, there probably are
other factors. So I, so what,

825
00:49:34,251 --> 00:49:36,560
what would you common sense
of we think are the factors?

826
00:49:36,561 --> 00:49:38,180
What keeps people from prepaying?

827
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:41,690
I think the most obvious one is just
a huge hassle and they're not paying

828
00:49:41,691 --> 00:49:43,880
attention.
So those are the first two I thought him,

829
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:48,440
could you think of another one? Maybe
they arrange their age. Okay. Exactly.

830
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,220
So maybe, so maybe demography
has an effect on it. Okay.

831
00:49:52,221 --> 00:49:56,780
So maybe for example, you get more
sophisticated the older you get, so okay.

832
00:49:56,781 --> 00:50:00,350
That was another factor we put in.
So I'm not telling you all the factors,

833
00:50:00,351 --> 00:50:05,270
but these were the two main, these
were the two main factors. Okay?

834
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,740
Another factor was growing sophistication.
We call it the smart factor.

835
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:15,530
Okay? So that's another
factor. Okay. But, but uh,

836
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:19,430
so over time you'd get
more sophisticated. So, um,

837
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:23,570
okay, so anyway, the point is
with a few of these factors,

838
00:50:23,571 --> 00:50:26,420
you see you got a pretty good fit and
it was pretty reliable and you could

839
00:50:26,421 --> 00:50:30,530
predict what gonna happen.
Contingently eh? Okay? And so now what,

840
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,320
so now if you want to
trade mortgages, how, what,

841
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:36,740
what are some of the interesting
things that happen? Okay? Well,

842
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:39,270
okay.

843
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:43,230
Okay. The first interesting
thing to notice is that, um,

844
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:48,060
what do you think happens as the
interest rate goes down? Okay?

845
00:50:48,061 --> 00:50:52,560
So the first thing to notice is,
all right,

846
00:50:52,561 --> 00:50:56,820
so I'll just make to, uh,
ask you two questions.

847
00:50:56,821 --> 00:50:58,650
Let's go on the other side
of running out of room.

848
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,730
Suppose that you have the mortgage value.

849
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,650
You know what you get in the tree bite.
So in this tree that we've built,

850
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:10,740
you know, here's the tree.
It's going like that.

851
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:14,220
And at every node we're predicting,
you know,

852
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:17,490
for each class of people were
predicting where his ones are.

853
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:22,070
So that class is prepaying.
The other class is not as
smart. So they've, you know,

854
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,580
they're not prepaying here,

855
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:27,570
but maybe when things get really low
they'll start prepaying here. So each,

856
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:31,590
each class of people, each cost alertness
type has its own tree, the same tree,

857
00:51:31,591 --> 00:51:36,300
but its own behavior on the tree. Then
I add them all together. Okay. So,

858
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,493
um,

859
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:42,860
what happens with the
starting interest rate?

860
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:46,383
Okay,

861
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,880
so here we had 0.06 and this value was,
you know,

862
00:51:49,881 --> 00:51:51,800
98 or something.

863
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:55,430
Right now suppose the interest
rate went down to 0.05,

864
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,010
I drew this picture of interest

865
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,100
and mortgage value.

866
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:03,140
Okay.

867
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:06,080
What do you think happens? So the
interest starts, this is, you know,

868
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:09,950
98 6% is there is the
interest rate goes down.

869
00:52:09,951 --> 00:52:12,230
What do you think happens to
the value of the mortgage?

870
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:18,240
If you're a bank and you've fixed the,

871
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:22,550
the mortgage rate is 8% hey
that's a fixed mortgage rate,

872
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:26,270
but now you've moved in
the tree from here to here.

873
00:52:26,271 --> 00:52:29,420
Do you think your mortgage is going
to go up in value or down in value?

874
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:40,290
It's going to go up because the interest
rates are lower and the present value

875
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:44,310
of the payments is getting higher.
Okay. So if the interest rate goes down,

876
00:52:44,311 --> 00:52:48,420
the mortgage is going to go
up like that typically. Okay.

877
00:52:48,421 --> 00:52:50,340
But will it keep going
up like this and this,

878
00:52:50,341 --> 00:52:53,070
if it were a bond it would go
up like that. Right? A bond,

879
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:57,480
you know a one year bond which owed one
over one plus r you know we keep going

880
00:52:57,481 --> 00:53:01,410
up and up the value far got negative
say it would go up but you know,

881
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:04,590
so as our got negative and
would go way up like that.

882
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:10,680
So does the mortgage keep going up like
that? As the interest rate goes down,

883
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:13,530
is the value of the mortgage is going
to get higher and higher and higher?

884
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:17,850
Huh?

885
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:21,360
Suppose the guys optimal, what's going
to happen? This is a hundred here.

886
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:26,940
What will happen?
Yup.

887
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,970
He's going to eventually figure out
that he should prepay like you know,

888
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:34,220
so it'll go like this.
If he's perfectly optimal,

889
00:53:34,221 --> 00:53:37,730
he'll never let it go above a hundred so
it's going to go something like this is

890
00:53:37,731 --> 00:53:40,490
the interest rate gets higher,
you get crushed.

891
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:42,200
And as the interest rate gets lower,

892
00:53:42,201 --> 00:53:45,530
you don't get the full upside
because he's prepaying, you know,

893
00:53:45,531 --> 00:53:47,720
at a hundred he's never
letting it go above 100

894
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,513
okay.

895
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:55,970
Right? So if he's not so
optimal, maybe you'll value
will go up, but not, you know,

896
00:53:55,971 --> 00:53:57,470
not so astronomically high.

897
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:01,760
So this idea that the mortgage curve
instead of being like this goes like that.

898
00:54:01,761 --> 00:54:03,860
This is what was called
negative convexity.

899
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:07,410
Okay.

900
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,510
Okay.
Now the next thing,

901
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:14,370
the next thing to know is suppose that,

902
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:20,070
um, suppose that the thing is
the guys are partly irrational.

903
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,780
So it's going above a hundred. Okay.
So it's starting to go like this.

904
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:28,140
Then what do you think is the
interest rate gets really low?

905
00:54:28,141 --> 00:54:29,190
What's going to happen?

906
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:36,150
All right. You just said it.
So if the guy was rational,

907
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,040
perfectly rational would go like that.

908
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:42,210
He'd never let it go above a hundred
but now suppose guys are not totally

909
00:54:42,211 --> 00:54:43,044
rational.

910
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:47,310
What's going to happen is they're going
to sort of as rates get a little bit low,

911
00:54:47,311 --> 00:54:49,980
they're not, they're going to overlook
the fact that they should prepay.

912
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:51,480
So now it's advantageous to you.

913
00:54:51,481 --> 00:54:54,960
Things are worth more than a hundred
but if rates get incredibly low,

914
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:57,660
even the dumbest guy,
the least, the least,

915
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:01,740
the highest cost guy is going to
realize he is an advantage to prepay.

916
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,990
And so things are going
to go back down like that.

917
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,170
So the value is going
to be quite complicated.

918
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,710
So this is the mortgage value
as a function of interest rates.

919
00:55:10,711 --> 00:55:14,970
Just common sense will tell you
this, that okay, in a typical bond,

920
00:55:14,971 --> 00:55:17,850
as the interest rate gets lower,
the present value gets higher.

921
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:20,760
You should expect a curve like that.
But because of the option,

922
00:55:20,761 --> 00:55:23,280
if we're rationally and to exercise,

923
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:26,520
the curve would never get above a
hundred it would have to go like that.

924
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:29,610
But now if people are irrational,
you can take advantage of them.

925
00:55:29,611 --> 00:55:31,110
And get more than a hundred out of them.

926
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:34,410
But if the situation
gets so favorable to you,

927
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:38,160
it becomes blindingly obvious
eventually to them that uh, you know,

928
00:55:38,161 --> 00:55:41,460
they're getting screwed and eventually
they act and bring it all the way back to

929
00:55:41,461 --> 00:55:44,400
a hundred again. So this value
of the mortgage looks like that.

930
00:55:44,401 --> 00:55:47,790
So that's a very tricky thing
I'll even write. Very tricky.

931
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:51,690
Okay.
So if you don't know what you're doing,

932
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:56,460
you could easily get yourself
a hurt holding mortgages, okay?

933
00:55:56,461 --> 00:55:59,340
You could suddenly find yourself
losing money holding mortgages.

934
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,710
So that's my next subject here.
I want to talk about hedging.

935
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,030
Okay? So we know something
now about valuing mortgages.

936
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:14,510
I want to talk about hedging and what
hedge funds do and what everyone on Wall

937
00:56:15,901 --> 00:56:17,430
Street should be doing.

938
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:23,080
Okay? Which is hedging and I'm to,

939
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,370
I'm going to, okay. So

940
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,540
if you hold a mortgage,

941
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:28,810
you're going to hold that because maybe
you can lend a hundred to a bunch of

942
00:56:28,811 --> 00:56:31,720
people, but actually get a value
that's more than a hundred.

943
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:35,380
So it looks like you're here,
but you know, if interest
rates change a little bit,

944
00:56:35,381 --> 00:56:36,910
suddenly this huge value,

945
00:56:36,911 --> 00:56:40,690
you thought you had Mike collapse back
down to 100 or the interest rates might

946
00:56:40,691 --> 00:56:43,630
go up and am I collapsed to way
below a hundred. So, you know,

947
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,950
you look like you're well off,

948
00:56:44,951 --> 00:56:47,800
but there are scenarios where you could
lose money and you want to protect

949
00:56:47,801 --> 00:56:51,130
yourself against that. So how do you go
about doing it? What does hedging mean?

950
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:55,840
And I want to put it in the context,
the old context of the world series.

951
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,800
Okay.
Which we started with before.

952
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,770
So it's easier to understand there.
And I,

953
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:05,830
and so many of you will have
thought about this before,

954
00:57:05,831 --> 00:57:09,640
so you'll be able to answer it,
but if I put it in the mortgage context,

955
00:57:09,641 --> 00:57:14,620
it would seem just too difficult. I don't
know why I did that. So a world series,

956
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,570
I'm going to lower it in a second.

957
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:20,980
So suppose that the
Yankees have a 60% chance.

958
00:57:20,981 --> 00:57:24,250
I said beating the Dodgers, I thought
the Dodgers would be in the world series,

959
00:57:24,251 --> 00:57:27,820
60% chance of winning any gain.
Uh,

960
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,800
against the Phillies and the world series.

961
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:34,420
And you are a bookie and your fellow
bookies all understand that it's 60%.

962
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:38,380
So some naive Philly fan
comes to you and says,

963
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:43,510
I want to bet $100 that the
Phillies win the world series. Okay,

964
00:57:43,511 --> 00:57:46,510
should you take the better not
yes,

965
00:57:46,511 --> 00:57:50,330
you should take the bat because 60% of
the time you're going to win $100 though.

966
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:54,600
No, you, yes, you should take the bad.
If he bet on one game, you would, uh,

967
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:59,640
make with 60% probability you'd win a
hundred and was 40% probability you'd lose

968
00:58:00,611 --> 00:58:02,770
a hundred.
So that means on average,

969
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,770
you're expectation is equal to 20.

970
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:09,820
So if he's willing to bet $100 on
the Phillies winning the world,

971
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:12,130
that winning the first game
of the series with you,

972
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:15,250
you know that you're expected
chance of winning is $20.

973
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,830
You're expecting to win $20 from the guy.

974
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:22,960
Now suppose he's willing to make the
same bet $100 for the entire series.

975
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:24,710
Okay.

976
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,930
What's your chance of winning

977
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:30,960
and what's your expected profit from him?

978
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:35,600
Is it less than 2020 or more than 20

979
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:41,710
more than 20. Okay. It's going to turn
out to be, so a seven game series,

980
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:46,390
I'm going to turn out to be 42 which we're
going to figure out in a second. Okay.

981
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,200
But what's your risk? What's
your risk? If it's one game,

982
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:54,430
in either case, you might lose $100. The
Phillies, you know, they're, they're,

983
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:56,350
you know,
they're probably going to lose,

984
00:58:56,351 --> 00:58:58,660
but there's a chance something
goes crazy and we'll, you know,

985
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:02,840
some unknown guy hits five home runs
in the first four games or something in

986
00:59:02,841 --> 00:59:05,470
some other unknown guy hits another
four home runs and you know,

987
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:06,670
you'll lose the world series.

988
00:59:06,671 --> 00:59:11,671
You could lose $100 and maybe the guy's
not getting $100 per $100,000 or $100

989
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,470
million. You know, you've
got a favorable bet,

990
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:18,160
but you don't want to run the risk of
losing even though there's not that high a

991
00:59:18,161 --> 00:59:22,490
chance you're going to lose. What
can you do about it? Okay. So,

992
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:24,223
uh,

993
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:29,120
well you know that there's these other
bookies out there who every game are

994
00:59:29,121 --> 00:59:34,121
willing to bet at odd 60 40 either
direction on the Phillies are the Yankees

995
00:59:34,941 --> 00:59:36,980
because they just all know
they're just like you.

996
00:59:36,981 --> 00:59:40,580
You all know that the odds are 60%
for the Yankees winning every game.

997
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:42,980
So suppose this naive guy,

998
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:48,220
the Phillies fan comes up Hugh and
bet $100 on the world series that the

999
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:49,640
Phillies or when

1000
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:54,500
you don't want to run
the risk of losing $100,

1001
00:59:54,501 --> 00:59:56,900
you know there are these other
bookies were willing to take bets,

1002
00:59:56,930 --> 01:00:01,100
a game at a time, 60 40 odds.
What should you be doing?

1003
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:02,893
What would you do?

1004
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:10,783
Okay,

1005
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:12,443
yes.

1006
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:17,083
Okay,

1007
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,570
so what would you do?

1008
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,650
So this guy has come to you and you're
not going to be able to give the,

1009
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:24,390
we're going to find out exactly
what you should do in one second,

1010
01:00:24,391 --> 01:00:28,200
but let's just see how far you can
get by reason, without calculation,

1011
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:30,540
what you saw. Okay, this guy
has come to you and said,

1012
01:00:30,541 --> 01:00:33,390
I'm betting $100 on the Phillies
winning the world series.

1013
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:35,430
This is the night before the first game.

1014
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:40,910
Every book he's standing by ready
to take bets at 30 to 20 odds.

1015
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:43,950
What would you uh,
do?

1016
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:47,760
Yeah,

1017
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:51,320
that what? Yeah, how much?

1018
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:55,263
Yeah,

1019
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:57,070
you bet the whole hundred dollars.

1020
01:00:57,850 --> 01:00:58,683
Well,

1021
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:02,630
but would you bet the whole
hundred dollars in the first game?

1022
01:01:02,631 --> 01:01:05,180
The guy's only bet $100
on the whole series.

1023
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,513
Okay.

1024
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:12,060
Okay. So it's not so
obvious what to do. Right?

1025
01:01:12,061 --> 01:01:13,650
But he's got exactly the right idea.

1026
01:01:13,651 --> 01:01:18,630
You can hedge your bet by betting on the,
uh,

1027
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:23,520
okay. You can hedge your bet. Okay, so
here we are. Shouldn't have put that down.

1028
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:29,620
Oh, I don't, don't tell me I turned
it off. That would just kill me.

1029
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:34,400
Tell meant to hit mute.
I think I hit off.

1030
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:35,340
Okay.

1031
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:39,640
Okay. So, oh, how dumb.

1032
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,970
Okay,
so you would bet on the,

1033
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:47,620
well,
while that warms up,

1034
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:56,210
I can see it. Um, all right.

1035
01:01:56,211 --> 01:02:01,211
So what happens is you'll have a tree
which looks like this and like this,

1036
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:06,800
like this and like this.
Okay. Like this and like this.

1037
01:02:06,801 --> 01:02:10,160
And let's say we go out
a few games like this.

1038
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:15,450
Now this is a one, two, three game series.
All right? So I've done it. Here's the,

1039
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:18,530
here's the, uh, here's the
start of the world series.

1040
01:02:18,531 --> 01:02:22,920
This is the world series spreadsheet
you had before. Now here's the start.

1041
01:02:22,921 --> 01:02:23,850
Here's game,

1042
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:25,100
okay?

1043
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:28,400
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1044
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:33,380
So if you win the one, if the Yankees
win the series, they get $100.

1045
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,620
Okay?

1046
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:40,960
Okay? You get $100. Sorry.

1047
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:46,210
Oh, what an idiot. Um, one one. Oh,

1048
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:47,203
oh,

1049
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:55,060
okay. So every time you end up above
the star, when more than you lose,

1050
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:58,870
you get $100. On the other hand,
if you lose more than you win,

1051
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:00,580
you lose $100.

1052
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:02,190
Okay?

1053
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:06,720
Okay.
And so control copy here is losing,

1054
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:08,110
okay?

1055
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:12,430
$100. Okay? So now this tree, you
remember from doing it before,

1056
01:03:12,431 --> 01:03:15,730
it's just by backward induction.
If you look at the thing up there,

1057
01:03:15,731 --> 01:03:19,690
it says you get, you know, 60%,

1058
01:03:19,691 --> 01:03:23,950
I think was the number we
figured out a over here. So,

1059
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:28,390
right? So 60% is the vow probability
of the Yankees win any game.

1060
01:03:28,391 --> 01:03:30,750
And so if you figure it, so, um,

1061
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:34,870
you take any node like
a, you know, this one,

1062
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:39,490
you're always taking 60% of
the value at the up up here,

1063
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:43,930
plus 40% of the value here.
Okay. So if you do that,

1064
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:48,790
you find out that the value to you is $42.
Just what we said.

1065
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:50,560
So let's put that in the
middle of the screen.

1066
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:52,140
Yeah.

1067
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:56,710
And that value is $42. Okay. Now if you,

1068
01:03:56,711 --> 01:04:00,130
if the Yankees win the first game,
you're in much better shape.

1069
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:03,790
So winning the first game means
you moved up to this node here,

1070
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:09,030
all of a sudden you went from $42 to $64.

1071
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:13,013
Okay?

1072
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:16,190
Okay.
And if the Yankees lost the first game,

1073
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:19,820
he would have gone down to that value,
which is like $9.

1074
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:25,320
Okay. You're expected winnings when
the Yankees are down a game, you know,

1075
01:04:25,321 --> 01:04:26,520
they're still a better team.

1076
01:04:26,521 --> 01:04:29,780
So actually it's more likely even after
losing the first game that the anchors

1077
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:31,980
would still win the series.
But you've watched,

1078
01:04:31,981 --> 01:04:34,920
so you see the risk that you're running
and you can calculate this. If so,

1079
01:04:34,921 --> 01:04:37,170
what should you do in the very first game?

1080
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:43,070
This tells you that you're
expected winnings is 42 of
course 0.6 times 64 that's

1081
01:04:44,491 --> 01:04:49,491
38.4 plus 0.4 times nine
is a 3.6 that is $42 okay?

1082
01:04:52,501 --> 01:04:57,501
So that's 42 cause it's an average of
this and this and 64 is the average of 0.6

1083
01:04:58,031 --> 01:05:02,340
to this. And point for that.
Okay? So what should you do?

1084
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:08,040
Well, on average you're going to make
$42. What's the essence of hedging?

1085
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:11,580
You want to guarantee that you
make $42 no matter what happens,

1086
01:05:11,581 --> 01:05:16,530
no matter who wins the series, you want
to end up with 42 extra dollars. Assuming,

1087
01:05:16,531 --> 01:05:19,420
you know the interest rate is zero from
the beginning to the end of the series.

1088
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:22,690
So how can you arrange that?
What can you do?

1089
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:33,400
Well, okay, so that's the
mystery. Give you one second
to try and think it through.

1090
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:37,180
Otherwise there'll be no, you should
get this. What would you do here?

1091
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:49,700
Are there no, um, baseball bookies in the

1092
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:53,410
Yup.
Uh,

1093
01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:59,710
that, that you view at, you can trust. Um,

1094
01:06:00,570 --> 01:06:02,570
and then you trust the rest of it too.

1095
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:08,090
Well, you can bet with another
booking, it's 60 to 40 odds.

1096
01:06:08,091 --> 01:06:10,190
If the Yankees win the first game.

1097
01:06:10,191 --> 01:06:14,720
You're just doing great fact from
the Yankees lose the first game.

1098
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,210
You know, you're looking to
be in a little bit of trouble.

1099
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:20,120
So the point is you're not going
get the payoffs till the very end.

1100
01:06:20,121 --> 01:06:23,510
He's a plus a hundred or minus a hundred,
but already by the first game,

1101
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:26,510
you're either doing better than you were
before or worse than you were before.

1102
01:06:26,511 --> 01:06:29,720
You're already in effect suffering
some risk at the very beginning.

1103
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:33,680
So this is one of the great
ideas of finance. You can,

1104
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:38,000
you shouldn't hedge the final outcome.
You should hedge next day's outcome.

1105
01:06:38,001 --> 01:06:41,240
If you are marking to market, that's
what you'd have to do marking to market.

1106
01:06:41,241 --> 01:06:45,170
You'd have to say, my position
now, my bet is worth $64.

1107
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:48,290
The Yankees lost the first game.
The bet would be worth $9.

1108
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:50,450
So what does it mean to protect yourself?

1109
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:53,030
Not just protect yourself against
what's happening? At the end.

1110
01:06:53,031 --> 01:06:55,910
That's really what you want to do.
But in order to do that,

1111
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:59,030
you should protect yourself every
day against what could happen.

1112
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:04,220
So every day you should end up with 42
here and 42 there because after all,

1113
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:07,250
that's what you're trying to lock in.
No matter who wins the first game,

1114
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:11,660
you should still say I'm $42 a head
cause I got myself in this position.

1115
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,100
So how could you do that?

1116
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:19,390
Well let's bet at three to two odds,

1117
01:07:19,881 --> 01:07:22,070
right?
60 40 is three to two odds.

1118
01:07:22,310 --> 01:07:27,310
Let's make a bet with another
bookie at 22 and 33 here.

1119
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:31,310
So 20 to put it in the wrong place.

1120
01:07:31,311 --> 01:07:36,311
This is the 33 and this is 22 but plus
33 and minus 22 so what are you doing

1121
01:07:38,871 --> 01:07:39,704
here?

1122
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:44,200
Notice that this is two times 11 this
is three times 11 this is 60 40 odds.

1123
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:48,160
I'm betting on the Phillies.
If the Phillies win one game,

1124
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:51,700
I collect $33 that's what I
should do. That he said, he said,

1125
01:07:51,701 --> 01:07:55,360
go to the bookie across the
street and bet on one game,

1126
01:07:55,361 --> 01:07:58,720
not the whole series better in one game
with that book, he across the street,

1127
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:01,360
$33 versus $22.

1128
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:03,953
Okay?

1129
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:07,300
Let's say you can only bet one game at
a time with the other bookies. Actually,

1130
01:08:07,301 --> 01:08:09,270
maybe you were saying all along
better on the whole series.

1131
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:13,000
Let's say you can only bet one game
at a time with the other, uh, bookies.

1132
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:17,840
You'd bet $33 on the Phillies and
the first game that night you,

1133
01:08:17,841 --> 01:08:20,840
Philly fan is put up $100 on the series.

1134
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:25,760
You're in the first game going to put $33.
You've taken his bed. So you're, you're,

1135
01:08:25,761 --> 01:08:27,290
you're hoping the Yankees win.

1136
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:30,350
But that's bad to be in a position when
you have to hope you don't want to do

1137
01:08:30,351 --> 01:08:33,800
that. So you take his bet
on the Phillies, you know,

1138
01:08:33,801 --> 01:08:36,980
cause he's given you a hundred
to a hundred odds. That's
even odds. Even though,

1139
01:08:36,981 --> 01:08:39,080
you know the Yankees have
a 60% chance of winning,

1140
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:42,410
you go to the bookie across
the street and you bet at 60,

1141
01:08:42,411 --> 01:08:45,770
40 odds on the Phillies,
but you don't put the whole hundred,

1142
01:08:45,771 --> 01:08:50,300
you only bet $33 of it. So if you
win, you get $33. If you lose,

1143
01:08:50,301 --> 01:08:52,010
you only have to pay the guy 22.

1144
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:55,640
So what's going to happen
after the first day?

1145
01:08:56,270 --> 01:09:00,920
This position is going to be worth 42
and this position is also going to be

1146
01:09:00,921 --> 01:09:05,210
worth 42 exactly where you
started. So because, uh,

1147
01:09:05,211 --> 01:09:09,650
when in the first game is going to put
you so far ahead in your bet with the

1148
01:09:09,651 --> 01:09:10,910
first naive Philly,

1149
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:15,980
better and a loss in the first game
is going to put you so far behind,

1150
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:20,150
you hedge that possibility by going,
um,

1151
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:23,420
33,
22 in favor of the Phillies.

1152
01:09:23,421 --> 01:09:28,421
You take a big bet on the Yankees and
then you make a smaller bet on the

1153
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:32,060
Phillies that cancels out part
of the big bet on the Yankees,

1154
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:34,970
but you've made the two at different odds.
And so on net,

1155
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:39,350
you're still going to be
$42 a head, okay? So that's,

1156
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:42,920
let's just pause for a second and see
if you, you got that. So by doing this,

1157
01:09:42,921 --> 01:09:45,710
you can't possibly lose any money.

1158
01:09:45,711 --> 01:09:50,150
And now you're going to repeat this bet
down here in here. Okay? So in the next,

1159
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:55,670
um, you see where do things go
next here or you're down $8.

1160
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:58,070
Okay? If you, if you lost again,

1161
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:02,240
you'd be down $32 now things would
really be bad after the Yankees lost two

1162
01:10:02,241 --> 01:10:06,170
games in a row. Your bet with
the original, your original
bet would look terrible,

1163
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:09,890
okay? But things aren't so bad
because you've been betting,

1164
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,850
you bet on the Phillies here,
you already made $33. Okay?

1165
01:10:13,851 --> 01:10:15,590
So how much money do you think you'll,
you'll,

1166
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:17,540
you should be betting on
the Phillies down here.

1167
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:25,730
Okay? Well you want to
lock in $42 at every node,

1168
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:27,110
no matter what happens,

1169
01:10:27,111 --> 01:10:32,111
this $42 by making the right offsetting
bet you can keep 42 everywhere here

1170
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:35,060
until the very end.
And so no matter what happened,

1171
01:10:35,061 --> 01:10:39,640
you can always end up with $42 hey,
that's the essence of hedging. So let's,

1172
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:42,530
let's just say it again.
What the idea is. Okay?

1173
01:10:42,531 --> 01:10:44,840
It's a great idea and we don't have
time to go through all the details.

1174
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:49,010
But the great ideas, this, you've
made some gigantic bet with somebody.

1175
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:52,370
Why do you bet with anybody? Because
you think you know more than they do.

1176
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,520
The whole essence of trading and finances,

1177
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:59,420
you think you understand the world
better than somebody else. So, so you're,

1178
01:10:59,421 --> 01:10:59,781
you know,

1179
01:10:59,781 --> 01:11:02,690
understand that means you
think something's going to
turn out one way that the

1180
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:05,480
other guy doesn't really
know is going to happen.

1181
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:08,750
So you're making a bet on whether
you're right or wrong. Okay?

1182
01:11:08,751 --> 01:11:12,950
So just because you think you, when you
say you know, you don't know for sure,

1183
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,980
you just have a better idea than he does.
So you don't want,

1184
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:20,070
you want to use your idea
without running the risk.

1185
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:23,910
So how can you do it if your
idea is really correct, okay?

1186
01:11:23,911 --> 01:11:28,740
There may be a way so that you
can eliminate the luck. So here,

1187
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:30,600
if you really know the odds are 60,

1188
01:11:30,601 --> 01:11:33,900
40 year class of bookies
knows the odds are 60, 40,

1189
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,200
and some other guys who doesn't
know things, the odds are 50, 50,

1190
01:11:37,201 --> 01:11:41,940
and is willing to bet against you.
You can lock in your $42 for sure.

1191
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:45,750
You don't just take a bat and,
uh, you know, hope you win,

1192
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:50,580
you can take a bat and then hedge
it to lock in your profits for sure.

1193
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:51,900
A step by step.

1194
01:11:51,901 --> 01:11:56,270
And that's what we have to explain how
that dynamic hedging words. So, um,

1195
01:11:57,060 --> 01:12:01,200
I have to stop unfortunately. So
Sunday we're going to do the, uh,

1196
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,140
glass about mortgages.
