1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:06,160
We've dealt so far with the case of
certainty and we've done almost as much as

2
00:00:06,161 --> 00:00:09,880
we could in certainty. And, uh,

3
00:00:09,881 --> 00:00:12,730
I now want to move to
the case of uncertainty,

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,950
which is really where things get much
more interesting and things can go wrong.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,380
So I'm going to cover this.
Okay.

6
00:00:25,381 --> 00:00:26,580
So we're ready to start.

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,673
Okay.

8
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,350
So, so far we've considered as is the case
of certainty. So with, with uncertainty,

9
00:00:36,351 --> 00:00:37,970
things get much more interesting.

10
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:40,790
And I want to remind you
of a few of the basics of,

11
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:45,380
of a mathematical statistics
that I'm sure you know.

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,950
So, you know, we deal
with a random variables

13
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,100
which have uncertain outcomes,

14
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,710
but with well-defined,
with well defined probabilities.

15
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,543
Okay?

16
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,900
Okay? So another step that we're not
going to take in the scores, just to say,

17
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:19,020
people just have no idea what the
chances are. Something's going to happen.

18
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,900
Shiller things we live in a
world like that where, you know,

19
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:24,570
who knows what the future's gonna be like,
and people,

20
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,500
they hear a story and then everybody
gets wildly optimistic and then they hear

21
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:31,830
some terrible story and then everyone
gets wildly pessimistic, you know?

22
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:35,100
And that kind of mood swing
can affect the whole economy.

23
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,600
I'm not going to deal with that.

24
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:41,601
It's hard to quantify and I'm not exactly
sure it's as important as he thinks it

25
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:45,570
is. So we're going to deal with the
case where many things can happen,

26
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:48,930
but you know what the chances are
that they could happen. He's still,

27
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:53,420
lots of things can go wrong in that case.
So there are a couple things that I, uh,

28
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,690
words that I want to you to know,
which we went over last time.

29
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:01,470
And I'll just do an example. So suppose
we always deal with states of the world.

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,550
Okay? States of nature that
was live, it's his idea.

31
00:02:04,551 --> 00:02:08,670
So let's take the simplest case where
with probability a half you could get one

32
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,570
and with probability a half
you can get minus one. Okay?

33
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:15,570
So that's a random variable.
It could, you could, you know,

34
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:19,100
it might be how your investment does half
the time you're going to make a dollar.

35
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,430
Half the time you got to lose a dollar.
So he defined the, so this is x.

36
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,940
So he defined the expectation of x,

37
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:32,210
which I write as x bar as the
probability of the upstate happening.

38
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:37,971
So let's just call that one half times
one plus one half times minus one which

39
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:42,820
equals zero. Then I define
the variance of X. Okay

40
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,060
to be how,

41
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,140
what's the expectation of the
square difference from the,

42
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,170
from the expectation.
So how uncertain it is,

43
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,540
you know you're sort of on
average expecting to get zero.

44
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,720
So uncertain it is as measured
by how far from zero you are,

45
00:02:57,721 --> 00:02:58,740
but we're going to square it.

46
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:04,020
So it's one half times one minus x bar
squared plus one half times minus one

47
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:10,170
minus x bar squared equals one half times
one plus one half times run jealously

48
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,091
equals one.

49
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:18,091
So the variances one and then I'll write
the standard deviation of x equals the

50
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:24,100
square root of the variance of x
equals the square root of one,

51
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:28,940
which is also one. So very often we're
going to use the expectation of acts.

52
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:30,830
That's going to be how good the thing is.

53
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,820
And the standard deviation is
going to be how uncertain it is.

54
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,420
And people aren't going to like soon
we're going to introduce the idea that

55
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:41,970
people don't like uncertainty and this
is the measure of what they do. Like it,

56
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:46,040
it pays off on average a big number.
Say this one doesn't, but it could.

57
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,700
And and the, the measure of
uncertainty is the standard deviation.

58
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:52,100
I choose that rather than
the variance for a reason.

59
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:55,760
You'll see it makes all the grass
prettier. But also if you double x,

60
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,890
you'll double the um,

61
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,750
the expectation obviously because you
just double everything inside here.

62
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,430
The variance though, you're going to
end up squaring the two. If you double,

63
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:11,270
if you double axe, you'll double
all these outcomes and the mean.

64
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,240
So you'll end up multiplying
the variance by four,

65
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,700
whereas you'll multiply the
standard deviation by two.

66
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:21,350
So we scaling just rescale is these two
numbers and as a funny effect on that

67
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:24,170
number. So that's the reason
why we use these two. Okay?

68
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:27,100
Now you can take another
example by the way,

69
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,790
which is a 0.9 times three.

70
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,610
Let's call this y and 0.1
times minus something.

71
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,630
How about scholars?
One third and this minus three.

72
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,151
Okay.
Now,

73
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:54,151
what's the expectation of why the
expectation of why equals 0.3 righty?

74
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,180
Well, let's just write it
out is 0.9 times a third

75
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,060
plus 0.1 times minus three,

76
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,840
which you can well 0.3
minus 0.3 which equals zero.

77
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,930
So the expectation of this random variable
is the same as the expert station of

78
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:20,410
that random variable.
And now the variance of this,

79
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,620
of why is 0.9 times a third minus zero
squared plus 0.1 times minus three minus

80
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:32,530
zero squared,

81
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:37,830
which equals 0.9 times one ninth right?

82
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:42,881
Plus Point one 0.1 times.

83
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,030
Um, mine. Okay,

84
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:52,031
which equals 0.1 plus 0.9 which equals
one which is the same as the other one.

85
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,310
So here we've got another random
variable which looks different from this.

86
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:03,670
So clearly standard deviation and
expectation don't characterize things.

87
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,660
This looks quite different from that
one has the same standard deviation,

88
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,850
the same expectation.
Okay?

89
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,060
So we're going to come back to what the
differences between these two variables

90
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:16,640
in a second. So there's another
thing I want to introduce,

91
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:21,380
which is the covariance of x and Y.
Okay?

92
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,770
So we could look at the
outcomes of these variables.

93
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,040
Where am I going to write this? We
could look, I'll write it over here.

94
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,240
We could look at the outcome of these
variables in a picture like this.

95
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,880
And so here we have x, and
here we have y. So x credit,

96
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,120
turn out to be expert. Turn out
to be one one. Why is a third

97
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,970
okay? And X could turn out to
be one one Y is minus three.

98
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,060
So here's an outcome
and here's an outcome.

99
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,510
And acts could be minus one and we
could get a third or minus three.

100
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:59,720
So therefore outcomes,
which looked at here, okay,

101
00:06:59,721 --> 00:07:04,310
so if you looked at Exelon, it's got
a 50 50 chance you're here or here.

102
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:08,780
If you look at why alone,
it's a 90% chance up there
and a 10% chance down there.

103
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,190
So those are called the
marginal distributions.

104
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:14,840
But the joint distribution,

105
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,470
we would have to add a number.

106
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,520
So if you looked at x alone, by the
way, you would say x alone, you'd say,

107
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:28,220
here's zero, here's one, here's minus one.

108
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:32,930
So you could have this or this with
probability a half and a half and why?

109
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:34,431
You know,

110
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:39,431
you could have sold this way with why
you could have a third or minus three and

111
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:45,800
here the probability is going
to be point mine and 0.1.

112
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:50,280
So that's what we have. Those
are the missus zero. Those
are the pictures that uh,

113
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,340
we started with. Okay, so you know
where x could end up and where,

114
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,670
why could end up? Well, you don't
know where they jointly could end up.

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,540
So if they end up on the long diagonal,

116
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,980
that means when x is high, wind tends
to behind. And vice versa, if you,

117
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:10,160
and if you end up down here,
x is low and why is low?

118
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:14,690
So to the extent that the
probability is on the long diagonal,

119
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,500
they're correlated together to the
extent that the probabilities on the off

120
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:21,740
diagonal there negatively correlated.
So anyway,

121
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,750
to get a night to get a sense of that,

122
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:28,160
the covariance is going
to be the probability

123
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,750
probability of one comma a third times
one minus x Bar Times a third minus y

124
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:45,320
bar. Okay. Plus the probability of,

125
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:50,270
I'll just go around the
circle of a minus one comma,

126
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,860
m a third times minus one x Bar Times,

127
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:02,160
uh, uh, times a third minus y bar. Okay.

128
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:07,161
Plus the probability of
m minus one and a third.

129
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,970
Uh, sorry, what did I just do? I did minus
one, the third. I've already done that.

130
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:15,900
So I'm down here.

131
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:21,020
So minus one and minus three times minus
one minus x bar times minus three minus

132
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:28,080
x Bar plus probability
of the ordered pair.

133
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,790
Thank you. And probability. What's
the point? I haven't done yet.

134
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,320
One Comma minus three

135
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,890
times one minus x Bar Times
minus three minus y bar. Okay,

136
00:09:43,891 --> 00:09:48,060
so now why does that covariance pick
up the idea of correlation? Well,

137
00:09:48,061 --> 00:09:53,040
to the extent that the probabilities are
high here and over there on the along

138
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:58,041
diag know this term is going
to get a lot of weight and um,

139
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,100
the what is the other term minus one minus
three and this term is going to get a

140
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:07,130
lot of weight. So to the extent
that you're on the long diagonal,

141
00:10:07,131 --> 00:10:09,150
this term and this term are
going to get a lot of weight,

142
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,950
but you see those terms,

143
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,540
this is going to be positive because it's
one minus zero and a third mind is too.

144
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,470
So that's a positive term and this is
negative minus one minus zero minus three

145
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:19,850
minus you.

146
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,010
So negative times a negative is also
positive till the extent that you're down

147
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:23,910
here and up there,

148
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,510
you're going to get big positive numbers
in the covariants to the extent you're

149
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:31,350
on the off diagonal,
you'll get big probabilities here,

150
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:33,150
but they all multiply negative terms.

151
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:37,350
This is a minus and this is a minus
because one of the terms is above the mean

152
00:10:37,351 --> 00:10:40,200
and the other one's below the mean.
That's what it means to be in the off Dag.

153
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,280
So covariance is giving you a sense of
whether things are moving together are

154
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:47,100
moving opposite the opposite way.
Okay?

155
00:10:47,101 --> 00:10:49,080
So those are the basic
things you have to know.

156
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,940
And I guess another couple of things are,
the covariance is linear in x,

157
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,820
right? Because the
covert, if you double x,

158
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,240
every time you see the
x variable over here,

159
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:04,360
it's always an x outcome minus an x bar,
an x outcome minus an x bar.

160
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,010
Next outcome minus an x bar. Next
outcome minus x bar. So if you double x,

161
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:11,410
you're going to double every term.
So it's linear in ax,

162
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,110
linear,
an x and y.

163
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,200
And so one last thing to keep
in mind is that the variance.

164
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,300
So the,
uh,

165
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:29,380
the variance of a x is just the
covariance of x with itself.

166
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,270
Obviously if you just plug in x equal
to y, you just get the formula for,

167
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:40,500
for a covariance, okay? And
similarly, because they're linear,

168
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:45,501
the covariance of x plus y with it's
so the variance of x plus y one more

169
00:11:47,311 --> 00:11:51,300
formula of x plus y by
linearity. Well, first of all,

170
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:53,740
that's the covariance
of x plus y with itself.

171
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,560
And therefore by linearity.

172
00:11:56,561 --> 00:12:01,360
Now I'm just going to do linear stuff
that's equal to the covariance of x with

173
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,190
x,
okay?

174
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:08,191
And plus the covariance of why with y
plus two times the covariance of x with y.

175
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,300
So I could take, since it's
linear, I could just, okay,
I just do the linear parts,

176
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:16,840
right?

177
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,490
Covariance of x plus y with x plus
wise covariance of x plus y with x plus

178
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,260
covariance of Eczema.
Swag with why.

179
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,200
Then I repeat the linearity thing
and I get down to that. Okay.

180
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:29,960
So those are basically the key formulas,
uh,

181
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,020
to know.
Okay.

182
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,680
So now I'm going to make three little
observations that come out of Alvis that

183
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:43,960
are quite fascinating.
So quite elementary.

184
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:46,480
There are any questions about
this, these numbers? Yes.

185
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,920
Oh yeah,
I'm that the probability of negative one,

186
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,490
negative one,
negative three.

187
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,110
Why did we give,
say that again?

188
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,880
Underlying probability of making one

189
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,920
probably have a negative one. Common
negative three. That's this outcome. Here.

190
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,830
We underlined it.
Not because it was very likely,

191
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:16,000
but because this term is going
to be positive. This is positive.

192
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:17,250
And this is positive.
So to the,

193
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,220
so the whole point is the joint
distribution is not specified,

194
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,730
not determined
by,

195
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,010
uh,
the distributions

196
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,040
of x alone and why alone.

197
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,160
Okay. So, even if I know the probability
of what x could do and I know what the

198
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:45,260
probabilities that why could do that,

199
00:13:45,261 --> 00:13:50,120
doesn't tell me anything
about what numbers I should
put on these four outcomes.

200
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,260
For example,

201
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,340
I could have at one
extreme x when x is high,

202
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,870
why is high? It can't be exactly that
because the probabilities are different.

203
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,240
So or, or I could, you
know, if they're there,

204
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,700
these numbers and those numbers
don't determine these four numbers.

205
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:13,430
Okay. So there are many different numbers
I could put in these four squares,

206
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:18,790
which would give me in total
this probability outcome
for x and then total this

207
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,050
probability outcome for why.

208
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,450
So an easy way to see that is
if I made them I shoulder. Okay.

209
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,400
So,
so the distribution now,

210
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:36,200
um, so okay, so what are the
observations I want to make? Okay. Um,

211
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,450
for instance,
I could say if x turns out to be a half,

212
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,040
then I'll always assume why.
Turns out to be a half. Okay.

213
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,140
And then with the other 40% of the time,

214
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:54,170
why might turn to be when wise
high x might have to turn off.

215
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,280
So I could have, I could have
that, you know, I could put a,

216
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,660
so here are some ways I could do this.
I could put 50% here,

217
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,240
0.5 here,
right?

218
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:10,070
So 50% then 40% of the time
this is going to turn out, okay.

219
00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:14,150
So I have a 0.5 here, okay. Then
what can I do with the rest of this?

220
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,940
Uh, this plus this has
to add up to 50%. Okay.

221
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And so 50% I could have
x turnout to be here.

222
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,043
MMM.

223
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:34,100
50% of the time. X. Okay. So
when x is one, I could have,

224
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,720
why always turn out to be one.

225
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,680
So that means I must have a
probability here of x, uh,

226
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:44,681
of probability is zero here because
here's x 50% so this plus this ax is going

227
00:15:44,731 --> 00:15:46,850
to churn out 21 50% of the time.

228
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:51,170
Now how much of the time is why going
to turn out to be down here? Point one.

229
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,760
So suppose I put these
probabilities 0.4 now.

230
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:58,640
So you see that x is 50% of the time,

231
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:03,680
x is one and 50% of the
time x is minus one. Okay.

232
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:08,681
Now how many of the Times
is x is y a third point,

233
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:13,190
five plus point for so 90% of the
time and then 10% of the time,

234
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:14,330
why is minus three?

235
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:18,590
So here's one way of putting probabilities
on the dots that produces this

236
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:19,424
outcome.

237
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,750
But I could have chosen another way of
doing it the way that you probably had in

238
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:26,270
mind where I assume they're
totally independent.

239
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,630
That is knowing the outcome of
acts in this way of doing it.

240
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:34,420
If I know that extra.to B one y has
to turn out to be a third. So they,

241
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,120
they're very dependent
x's somehow causing wire.

242
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,830
Determining why x has a lot
of information about why.

243
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,350
Suppose I make them independent.

244
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,910
I say what happens here has nothing
to do with what happens over there.

245
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,470
Then I'd write the probabilities
instead of these, I'd ride it. Um,

246
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,980
0.45,
hey,

247
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:56,030
I take a half times 0.9 is 0.45.

248
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,960
And then the chance that you go up,
you go down for x,

249
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:03,230
which is 0.5 and up for up for y,

250
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:07,940
which is a minus point forth,
which is also 0.45 here.

251
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:13,310
Okay?
And then I'd go 0.05 here and 0.05 there.

252
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,853
So here,

253
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,600
knowing that a y has a good outcome tells
you nothing about what ax is going to

254
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:23,920
do. It's still equally likely actions,
good or bad. Knowing that, well,

255
00:17:23,921 --> 00:17:26,660
I had a bad outcome.
Why is still equal?

256
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:30,590
X is still likely to be equally
likely good or bad, okay.

257
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:34,580
And simply knowing the outcome of x tells
you nothing about the outcome of why

258
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,400
this is nine times this.
And this is nine times that.

259
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:39,800
So this is the yellow is independence,

260
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,370
okay.

261
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:42,521
Hey,

262
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:47,521
which is probability x equals
x times x and y equals y

263
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,060
equals
the product.

264
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:54,930
Probably x equals x times
probability y equals y.

265
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,200
So that's the case of independence.
So in the case of independence,

266
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:00,840
knowing something about one variable
tells you nothing about what happened to

267
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:04,260
the other variable, but you could do
other joint things. So the joint, this,

268
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:07,020
although the knowingly
each of them separately,

269
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:08,760
it doesn't tell you how
they're jointly distributed.

270
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:13,020
And the covariance is an effort to
see whether they're sort of correlated

271
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:17,640
together or whether they're
correlated independently.
So independence, by the way,

272
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,040
independence implies
covariance equals zero.

273
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:24,841
Okay.

274
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:29,520
And that's obvious because
what's happening in the x
variables got nothing to do

275
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:32,940
with what's happening in the y variable.
So since it's linear and acts,

276
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,060
you can hold why fix and and,

277
00:18:35,061 --> 00:18:38,850
and the access just the same and you're
going to get something that adds up to

278
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:42,390
zero.
So for any fixed value of why this number,

279
00:18:42,391 --> 00:18:44,130
we'll just give you the expectation of x,

280
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:47,460
which won't depend on why it's going to
be zero in every case. So therefore, the,

281
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:50,550
if they're independent, the
covariance has to be zero. Okay?

282
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:53,820
So independence means x
and y tell you nothing.

283
00:18:53,821 --> 00:18:57,270
That means the covariance of zero.
They could be positively distributed,

284
00:18:57,271 --> 00:19:00,270
like up here or negatively distributed
either way. You want to do it.

285
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,940
Does that make sense? You asked
me about this. Yeah. Okay.

286
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:11,160
All right. So what, what are the key
simple observations here that, uh,

287
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:16,050
are gonna inform a lot of our
behavior on drug uncertainty? Well,

288
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,860
it'll, it's gonna turn out
that expectation is good

289
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:26,220
and um,
standard deviation is bad.

290
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,211
Okay?

291
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:32,211
So if we take this variable
that we just found w x and Y,

292
00:19:32,611 --> 00:19:36,690
we're both here,
x and y were both there,

293
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,950
right? They each had standard
deviation one and expectations zero.

294
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:49,830
So this is the standard deviation.
So x is here,

295
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,970
and by the way, so as y, same thing. Well,

296
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:59,420
suppose I put half my money into x
and I put half my money into why.

297
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,320
And if I put half my money in each,
let's say I get half the pay off of each.

298
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,330
Okay? I make half the bat and I get
half of the outcome. What happens to my,

299
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:14,280
what happens to my expectation?
Well, the expectation of that

300
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:21,670
obviously equals a half x
bar plus a half wide bar.

301
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:26,710
Charlottesville equals zero. So it's
staying the same expectation hasn't moved,

302
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:30,880
but what's the variance of
a half x plus a half? Why?

303
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,610
Okay. Well, by that formula,
it's the covariance.

304
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:43,230
So I'm just going to do this formula.

305
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,860
I'm going to do a half
here and a half here,

306
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,490
okay? So it's the cove,
okay? So it's the same thing.

307
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:55,760
So it's the covariance of a half facts
with a half x was the covariance of the

308
00:20:55,761 --> 00:20:59,470
half experts. A half. Why?
Plus a half and a half.

309
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:00,940
Okay?

310
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,470
But the covariance of a half
x with a half x is just,

311
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,570
okay, what is that? It's
the variance of a half x.

312
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:14,170
But we already saw from our
definition of Varian's over here.

313
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,120
Remember if you double ax,

314
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:19,630
you're going to multiply the various
by four because you're squaring things,

315
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,321
okay?

316
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:25,321
So this is going to turn out to be a
quarter times the variance of x and this

317
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,490
which is a half and a half.

318
00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:35,140
Why is going to be a quarter
times the variance of y?

319
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,580
And if the two are independent,
the covariance will be zero.

320
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,380
So in this example of these two variables,
if I take the,

321
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,440
the orange distribution where
they're independent, you know, I can,

322
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,210
I can do an x outcome and have this
standard deviation and this expectation,

323
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:55,420
zero expectation. And that standard
deviation, I could do the why thing,

324
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:59,230
get the same standard deviation,
or I can put half my money in each.

325
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:03,670
It seems like a total waste of time to
put half my money in each. After all,

326
00:22:03,671 --> 00:22:06,460
they are giving me the same standard
deviation. But no, it isn't.

327
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:07,420
If they're independent,

328
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,600
you're shockingly drastically reducing
your standard deviation because if

329
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:17,200
they're independent, the covariances
zero. And so this plus this,

330
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,830
the variance of x equal the
variance of y is just the half.

331
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:26,220
The variance of x equals
half the variance of y.

332
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,970
Okay, so that's shocking.
So the standard deviation,

333
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:34,540
therefore the square root of
that is one over the square root.

334
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,430
So by putting half your money in each,

335
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,160
you've now loose this when
they're independent. So this is,

336
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,640
this is the standard deviation
of one half x plus one half lie,

337
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,460
uh, x, y independent. Okay.

338
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,020
Move from this point to that point,

339
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:57,670
you reduced your standard deviation
without affecting your expectation. Okay?

340
00:22:57,671 --> 00:23:02,290
So the first lesson that, uh, we're
going to see applied, I'm just, you know,

341
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:05,410
this is all mathematics. So, you
know, mathematicians understood those,

342
00:23:05,411 --> 00:23:08,330
of course a long time ago.
But to realize this has an application,

343
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,430
economics wasn't so obvious. So this is
the thing of, of Shakespeare knew it.

344
00:23:12,431 --> 00:23:17,290
You know, it's a diversification.
So don't put all your, you know,

345
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:20,830
spread your investments
out into different waters.

346
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,600
Shakespeare, you know, Antonio had
a different ship on each ocean.

347
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,850
So instead of putting all
the ships on the same ocean,

348
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:30,340
you put them on different oceans,
which he assumed was independent.

349
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,130
So he had the same expected outcome,

350
00:23:33,131 --> 00:23:36,430
assuming the pads were just as quick
to wherever he was selling the stuff,

351
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:39,940
same expected outcome, and that each
of the waters were equally dangerous,

352
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:43,140
but he drastically reduced his ex is,
is variants.

353
00:23:43,141 --> 00:23:45,740
And because there are a lot of
oceans and a lot of ships, you know,

354
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:48,350
this number went down further and further.

355
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:51,650
So the key is to look for
independent risks. Okay.

356
00:23:51,651 --> 00:23:55,850
So that's one lesson in mathematics that
has a big application than economics.

357
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,230
What's a second, um, thing?

358
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,633
Well,

359
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,950
the second thing is that if you
add a bunch of risks together,

360
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:12,380
so I'm gonna say this loosely, so this
is if you add a bunch of risks together.

361
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,760
So by the way, what's the generalization
of this before I say this,

362
00:24:17,761 --> 00:24:21,030
if you had an and independent

363
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,120
risks
with

364
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,600
uh,
identical

365
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,230
means and variances,

366
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:37,990
okay means

367
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:42,790
let's call them all x bar and
variances, uh, sigma squared.

368
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,960
Hey, let's say they all have
expectation e and standard deviation,

369
00:24:46,961 --> 00:24:50,710
sigma squared variance, sigma
squared. Each of them has that.

370
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,130
Then what happens to the,
okay,

371
00:24:54,131 --> 00:24:56,050
so each of them has standard deviations.

372
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,680
So they're all identical like x
and y and the same expectations.

373
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,680
They're on the same standard deviation
one. So once I had 20 of those and I put,

374
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:07,060
um,
one 20th of my money into each of them,

375
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,490
what would happen to my expectation?

376
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,323
Okay,

377
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,090
one over n a dollars in each one

378
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,440
implies what happens to my,

379
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:28,320
my expectation expectation
equal to what each of them had.

380
00:25:28,321 --> 00:25:31,770
Expectation.
E I now split my money among all of them,

381
00:25:31,771 --> 00:25:35,430
all with the same expectation.
That also has to have expectation.

382
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,860
He all right,
just like this thing,

383
00:25:37,861 --> 00:25:40,320
putting half my money and why
and half my money in acts,

384
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:43,920
wherever the x one y was over here,

385
00:25:43,921 --> 00:25:46,680
x is there half my money in
acts and half my money in.

386
00:25:46,681 --> 00:25:50,160
Why is going to give me
the same expectation?

387
00:25:50,161 --> 00:25:52,740
If I had 12 projects like
that that were independent,

388
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,370
I'd still have the same expectation,
but my standard deviation,

389
00:25:56,371 --> 00:25:58,620
what's going to happen
to my standard deviation?

390
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,010
Well,
the variance,

391
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:10,470
the variance is going to be, so what's
gonna Happen to the standard deviation?

392
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:24,390
By what factor? So the variance.
So each it's going to be, yeah,

393
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,120
what's going to happen to the variance?

394
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,330
Put one over n dollars and
each of an identical, uh,

395
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,670
but independent, uh, investments.
What will my variance bay,

396
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:46,080
the variance is going to equal
over n times sigma squared.

397
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:50,460
Why is that? Because each one will
have one over n dollars in it.

398
00:26:50,461 --> 00:26:54,090
So its variance is going to be one
over n squared times sigma squared,

399
00:26:54,091 --> 00:26:57,720
but they're in of them. Okay. So it's
going to be in times one of rand squared.

400
00:26:57,721 --> 00:27:01,500
So it's just one of Ren.
So implies the standard deviation,

401
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,520
which implies the standard deviation.
So I'll call it standard deviation

402
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,700
is one over the square root
of n times sigma. Okay,

403
00:27:14,701 --> 00:27:17,430
so it's just as generalization,
we've got one over the square root of two,

404
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:20,090
so if I did and have them instead of two
of them might have one over the squared

405
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,670
event.

406
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:24,600
So those turned out to be very useful
formulas which are going to come up over

407
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:28,350
and over again and let's just say
it again so you get this straight.

408
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:33,590
If I have two independent random variables
and I split my money evenly between

409
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:35,910
them and they have the same expectation,

410
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,280
it doesn't have to be zero
could be a positive number.

411
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,930
If I split my money between them,

412
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:43,770
I haven't changed my expectation because
each dollar where hover, I split it.

413
00:27:43,771 --> 00:27:45,900
I'm putting into something
with the same expectation.

414
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,780
But because they're independent,

415
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,950
you get a lot of off
diagonal things happening.

416
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:56,940
The off diagonal things.
Remember a canceling one,
investments turning out well,

417
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:58,470
exes,
sorry.

418
00:27:58,471 --> 00:28:02,850
That's on the Dang the off diagonal
elements are good in a way because if one

419
00:28:02,851 --> 00:28:06,150
investments turning out well,
sorry, turning out badly,

420
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:09,180
the other one's turning out well.
So here investment wah,

421
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,550
why is turning out badly?
ButX is turning out well.

422
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:15,240
So to the extent you're off the diagonal,
your um,

423
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:19,980
canceling some of your bad
outcomes because one's good
and the other is bad. So,

424
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,280
uh, that way you leave
the expectation the same,

425
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,920
but you reduce the variance.
In fact,

426
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:29,010
it would be even better if you could
put everything on the off diagonal.

427
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,700
But to the extent you get at least
some stuff on the off diagonal,

428
00:28:32,701 --> 00:28:35,760
you're reducing the risk. Okay.
And how fast you reduce it.

429
00:28:35,761 --> 00:28:37,890
When they're independent,
you reduce it,

430
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,850
dividing it equally because
the variance is a square thing.

431
00:28:41,851 --> 00:28:43,020
Half your money in one and half.

432
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:46,110
And the other means the variance of the
first is a quarter and the variance of

433
00:28:46,111 --> 00:28:48,360
the second is a quarter.
But now there are two of them.

434
00:28:48,361 --> 00:28:52,020
So the total variance is a half of what
it was before. If you have 10 of them,

435
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,220
each one is a 10th. The money. So
it's got one, 100th of the variance,

436
00:28:56,221 --> 00:28:59,940
but there are 10 of them. So it's ten
one hundredth, one over n the variance.

437
00:28:59,941 --> 00:29:03,540
If you take the standard deviation, it's
one over the square root of N. Okay.

438
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:07,590
So that's the rate at which
you can reduce your, your, uh,

439
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,610
uncertainty and your risk.
And we're going to come to,

440
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:16,190
you'll see this gets much more concrete
and next lecture. But one more. Okay?

441
00:29:16,191 --> 00:29:18,420
So this is just stuff
that most of you know.

442
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:22,230
So one more thing if
you add a bunch of them,

443
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:24,990
bunch of independent things together,

444
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,250
independent random variables.
So I'm gonna speak very loosely now.

445
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:35,130
We are bowls. Uh, you get,

446
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,150
you get a normally
distributed random variables

447
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,840
and I'm very molt,

448
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:51,380
normally distributed random
variable with the corresponding,

449
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:55,760
uh,

450
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,440
expectation and standard deviation.
Okay?

451
00:30:00,441 --> 00:30:05,300
Now, so if you take these, you take half
your money in ancient. So if he took,

452
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,490
okay, so what am I saying? Okay,

453
00:30:07,491 --> 00:30:10,880
so I don't want to speak to precisely
about this because if you've seen this

454
00:30:10,881 --> 00:30:13,940
before and seen a proof, you know
everything about it. If you haven't,

455
00:30:13,941 --> 00:30:15,740
it's just too many subtleties to absorb.

456
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:20,300
But the normal distributed
random variables, the bell
curve that looks like that,

457
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,000
I wasn't too, okay, it looks like this.

458
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:29,840
Okay, so there's the bell curve
with expectations. Zero. Okay,

459
00:30:29,841 --> 00:30:32,330
so it's this bell curve.
Now what's special about it?

460
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:37,331
It hasn't a particular formula which has
got an exponential to a minus x squared

461
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:40,100
thing and he's got a particular formula
to it, which if you know, you know,

462
00:30:40,101 --> 00:30:42,860
if you don't, it's written down whenever
we're going to use the exact formula,

463
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,120
but it looks like that.

464
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,120
So these are the outcomes acts
and this is the probability,

465
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:51,120
probability of outcome
or frequency about com.

466
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,800
Okay,
so the bigger x is,

467
00:30:54,801 --> 00:30:59,390
and this is the mean equals zero, I've
assumed the mean is zero. So this is,

468
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,540
if you take a really big acts,
it's very unlikely to happen.

469
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:05,900
And a really small acts is very unlikely
to happen and axes near the mean are

470
00:31:05,901 --> 00:31:08,630
pretty likely to happen.
So anyway,

471
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:13,310
it's amazing that if you add this random
variable to itself a bunch of times,

472
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,250
it can only produce one and minus one.
Right.

473
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:18,440
This one produces totally
different outcomes.

474
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,010
A third in minus threes are
completely separate out their, their,

475
00:31:22,011 --> 00:31:25,640
their disjoint outcomes. But if
you add this together, you know,

476
00:31:25,641 --> 00:31:29,780
you can get 25 ones and 10 minus ones.

477
00:31:29,781 --> 00:31:34,700
So that gives you 15 over
here, you know, you could have,

478
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,023
mmm,

479
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:40,200
25 will never get me there. So
you can get a hat. So I'm sorry,

480
00:31:40,201 --> 00:31:43,650
that was a bad example. If I had
30 things I could get, you know,

481
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:47,190
18 ones and 12 minus ones,
that'll give me six.

482
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:52,350
You could have gotten six over here,
but with 30 outcomes you could get,

483
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:52,801
you know,

484
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:56,880
all 30 of them could have turned out to
be one and that would have gotten you

485
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:00,360
pretty close to the same
outcome. So it's not, you know,

486
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,600
just because these outcomes are separate.
Once you're adding them up,

487
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:07,290
you're starting to produce
numbers different from one
and minus one. You know,

488
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:08,370
and these added up,

489
00:32:08,371 --> 00:32:11,040
if you take the right combination
of one third in minus third,

490
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,860
you can start reproducing
things like to get a one here,

491
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,700
you can reduce three tops and then
you're, you're, you're producing a one.

492
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:18,301
So anyway,

493
00:32:18,301 --> 00:32:21,360
this shocking thing is if you add a
bunch of these random variables that are

494
00:32:21,361 --> 00:32:22,440
independent to each other,

495
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,070
you get something normally distributed
that looks like that because this random

496
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:28,830
variable had exactly the same
mean and standard deviation,

497
00:32:28,831 --> 00:32:30,180
you have the same number of these,

498
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:33,120
you're going to get outcomes that
are almost identically distributed.

499
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:35,070
So in the limit,
this random variable,

500
00:32:35,071 --> 00:32:38,910
enough of these added together looks
exactly the same as these added together.

501
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,260
Okay? That's the second
surprising mathematical fact.

502
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:47,270
And the third thing that we're going to
use is that the normal distribution is

503
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:49,940
characterized by the mean
and standard deviation.

504
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:53,720
That's all it takes to write the
formula. This down. And these numbers,

505
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,770
these are called thin tail.
These,

506
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,710
these probabilities go to zero very fast.

507
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:05,450
So you shouldn't expect many
outlying dramatic things to happen.

508
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:09,590
Okay.
And in the world they do happen.

509
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:14,210
And so we're going to see that much of
classical economics is built on normally

510
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:16,160
distributed things.
And so you can't see,

511
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:19,280
you shouldn't expect any
gigantic outliers to ever happen.

512
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,410
And it seems natural to build it on that
kind of assumption because if you add

513
00:33:24,411 --> 00:33:25,490
things that are independent,

514
00:33:25,491 --> 00:33:29,150
you get normal distributions all the
time and things seem independent.

515
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,550
So why shouldn't you get
normal distributions?

516
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,390
And yet we must not get it because
we have so many outliers. Okay.

517
00:33:35,391 --> 00:33:38,000
So that's the basic
background of mathematics,

518
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:41,360
learning questions about any of that.
I'm just assuming you know all that.

519
00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:41,830
And now we're

520
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,500
Ghana,
we're gonna move to

521
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,673
economics.

522
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:54,190
Yeah, I think that's all the
background you need. Okay. So here's,

523
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,140
I want to do one more thing, which is
maybe background, but it's quite a,

524
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:03,490
it's used in economics all the time.
Okay.

525
00:34:03,491 --> 00:34:06,880
And it's called the iterated expectations.

526
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,730
Okay.
So

527
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,430
if I told you that these
variables were correlated,

528
00:34:22,431 --> 00:34:24,710
like these appear like the orange things,

529
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:29,270
if I told you what x turned out to be,
that would tell you a lot about what,

530
00:34:29,271 --> 00:34:31,130
why was going to be.
So for example,

531
00:34:31,131 --> 00:34:35,030
if I told you that x was a sorry,

532
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,520
the the white ones are
the correlated ones.

533
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:41,240
If I tell you that x
has turned out to be one

534
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:48,480
that tells you that why has to
be a good outcome of a third?

535
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,150
Because if x is one,
this never happens.

536
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,450
So the only thing that can happen if x
is one is that why it turns out to be a

537
00:34:54,451 --> 00:34:55,020
third.

538
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,950
So knowing ax is going to completely
change your mind about the expectation of

539
00:34:58,951 --> 00:35:02,880
why.
So conditional expectation,

540
00:35:02,881 --> 00:35:05,790
I should have said this before.
Conditional expectation

541
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:13,030
simply means
we computing

542
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,640
recomputing
expectation

543
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:26,340
using um,
updated probabilities

544
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:34,430
from your information out in probably
done this in high school. So I'm not,

545
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:38,340
I'm just going to assume you know
how to do this. So in this case,

546
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:43,200
if I tell you something like x has turned
out to be one that tells you that only

547
00:35:43,201 --> 00:35:44,880
these two outcomes are possible.

548
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,960
So that means that the only two outcomes
in the white case have happened with

549
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:53,550
probably 0.5 and zero. But if I
tell you x is that come out to one,

550
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,940
the conditional probabilities have to
add up to once you just scale things up.

551
00:35:56,941 --> 00:35:59,430
So it's, you know, that x has, you know,

552
00:35:59,431 --> 00:36:02,340
that why I had to have been
the good outcome appear. Okay?

553
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:05,430
If I tell you that the bad outcome for,

554
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,620
for a why has happened,

555
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:12,570
if you have any of probabilities
of x of a 0.1. Okay, let's see.

556
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,140
So the zero makes things too easy.
Suppose I tell you that the, uh,

557
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,690
I tell you the good outcome
of why has happened.

558
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:25,490
What are the chances now that x has been
gotten the good outcome in the white

559
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,630
probability case?

560
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:27,880
Okay.

561
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,330
If I tell you that why it turned out
to be a third and the white probability

562
00:36:31,331 --> 00:36:35,370
case, what's the probability that x
turned out to be one conditional on that?

563
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:36,760
Yeah.

564
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,780
Five nights.
Okay,

565
00:36:37,781 --> 00:36:41,680
so that's it because the probabilities
are now you're reduced with 0.4 and 0.5,

566
00:36:41,681 --> 00:36:43,450
so five ninths of the time.
Okay.

567
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,050
So that's an idea which
I assume you all can fit.

568
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,320
It's very intuitive and it's
way too long to explain.

569
00:36:50,321 --> 00:36:53,200
Then I'm sure you know how to do that.
So anyway, the conditional expectation,

570
00:36:53,201 --> 00:36:57,250
blah. So the iterated expectation is
simply this. It's an obvious idea,

571
00:36:57,251 --> 00:37:01,360
but it's going to be incredibly useful
to us. It says, if I, if you ask me,

572
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,350
what are the chances that the Yankees
are going to win the world series against

573
00:37:05,351 --> 00:37:07,510
the Dodgers? Let's suppose
that soon it's going to play,

574
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,970
the Yankees are going to beat the Dodgers.
What do you think the chance,

575
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,600
what's the probability that's going to
happen? What do you expect the chances are

576
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:20,750
if I then ask you your opinion? My
opinion after the first game, well,

577
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:23,620
obviously if the Yankees win the first
game, my opinion's going to go up.

578
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:27,310
So I'm gonna have a different opinion.
If the Dodgers win the first game,

579
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:30,940
my opinion is going to go down.
So I'll have a different opinion.

580
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:35,440
But you can ask now another question.
What's your expected opinion going to be?

581
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:37,580
Okay.

582
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:42,000
The law of iterated
expectations is the ex expected.

583
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:47,590
So the expectation of x has to equal
the expected expectation of x given some

584
00:37:51,631 --> 00:37:52,464
information.

585
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:56,790
So here's what I think the
Yankees are 70% likely to win.

586
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:01,140
If I say after the first game, I'll
think it's 80% and after the first game,

587
00:38:01,141 --> 00:38:03,870
if the Dodgers win, I'll think
it's gone down to, you know,

588
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:09,040
a 65% it had better be that the average
of my opinions after the information is

589
00:38:09,571 --> 00:38:12,790
the same as the number I started
with. Okay. That's the law.

590
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:16,020
That's just common sense and I'm
not going to bother to prove that.

591
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:18,360
So that's incredibly
important that you're, you're,

592
00:38:18,361 --> 00:38:20,910
it's not only the expectation of x,
but as you learn stuff,

593
00:38:20,911 --> 00:38:22,950
you can anticipate your
opinion's going to change.

594
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,280
But your average opinion has to
always stay the same as as as x was.

595
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,750
Okay. So that's the, that's
the last of the background.

596
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:38,800
And now I want to do simple
application of this.

597
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:40,600
So in fact,
to that very question,

598
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,890
suppose that you're
playing a a world series,

599
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,070
the Yankees are playing the uh,

600
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:52,780
the Yankees are playing the
Dodgers and let's suppose that

601
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:57,370
the Yankees have a 60%
chance of winning any game.

602
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:01,760
Yeah,
I'll just do it here.

603
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,930
Yankees have a 60% chance
of winning any game.

604
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,680
What's the chance of the Yankees
win a three game world series.

605
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,503
Okay.

606
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:15,370
How do you figure that
out? Well, a naive way,

607
00:39:15,371 --> 00:39:19,210
a simple way of figuring that out
is to say, well what could happen?

608
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:24,330
Life can mean a Yankee win.
Let's call that an up or a Yankee loss.

609
00:39:24,331 --> 00:39:26,890
Let's call that a down.
Okay.

610
00:39:26,891 --> 00:39:31,891
And this could happen was probably 0.6
or point for the Yankees could win again.

611
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,460
Okay.
So that's probably 0.6.

612
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:41,440
We have two Yankee wins or the
Yankees could lose the second game.

613
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:44,860
So that's probably point for the
Yankees could lose or could win.

614
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:49,690
That's 0.6 and this is
0.4. Okay. And that's,

615
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:52,870
we've only played two games. The
Yankees could win a third. Well,

616
00:39:52,871 --> 00:39:56,020
you don't need to play this game cause
they've already won a three game series.

617
00:39:56,021 --> 00:39:59,310
But if you did it wouldn't matter.
Wait for,

618
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,260
or we could go

619
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,020
up or down.
Okay,

620
00:40:08,021 --> 00:40:12,850
the Yankees after winning and losing could
then when probably 0.6 or could lose.

621
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,860
Okay.
Or after losing and winning,

622
00:40:14,861 --> 00:40:19,861
they could win again or they could
lose after losing and winning,

623
00:40:20,381 --> 00:40:20,981
they could lose.

624
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:25,540
So this is probability 0.4 and this
is 0.6 and then finally we have this,

625
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:29,950
we have this. So this is 0.6. Okay?
So this is what the tree looks like.

626
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:33,190
You could imagine eight possible paths,

627
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,510
each of link three where you give the
whole sequence of wins and losses.

628
00:40:37,511 --> 00:40:42,280
So to compute the probability that
the Yankees, when you look at all the,

629
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:45,430
so in this case, the Yankees win,
right? They would have already one here.

630
00:40:45,431 --> 00:40:46,720
But if you play it out,
it doesn't matter.

631
00:40:46,721 --> 00:40:50,980
They're going to win here and here I've
got two wins and one loss here they've

632
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:55,390
got one. When two wins and one loss,
they win. Here, they've got, you know,

633
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,380
lost win. When they win the world
series here, they lose, win, lose,

634
00:40:59,381 --> 00:41:04,180
they lose the world series.
Here's lose, win, win, lose,

635
00:41:04,181 --> 00:41:07,120
lose. They also lose the world
series here. It's lose, lose,

636
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:11,200
they've lost the world series loss.
Okay? So these are the possible outcomes.

637
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:15,550
So you can compute the probability
of every path there, eight of them,

638
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,330
and then multiply that probability by
the outcome and you'll get the chance at

639
00:41:19,331 --> 00:41:24,250
the Yankees won the world series,
right? That's clear to everybody.

640
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,170
But there's a much faster way of doing
it and putting it on a computer. Okay?

641
00:41:29,171 --> 00:41:32,830
And that's using the law of
the iterated expectation.

642
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,090
So first of all,

643
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:41,570
so this is called the tree. So we're
gonna use trees all the time. Some tree,

644
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,190
I don't want to formally define it,

645
00:41:43,191 --> 00:41:46,870
it's just you start with something
and stuff can happen. You know,

646
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,410
stuff happens every period.

647
00:41:48,411 --> 00:41:50,900
And so you just write down all the
things that can happen and then you write

648
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:52,460
down all the things that
can happen after that.

649
00:41:52,461 --> 00:41:56,360
And the thing unfolds like a tree that's
formal enough to be, to describe a tree.

650
00:41:56,361 --> 00:41:58,610
And here we've got it.
But you notice that the tree,

651
00:41:58,611 --> 00:42:01,010
the number of things
happening grows exponentially.

652
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,190
It's horrible to have to compute
something growing exponentially,

653
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:09,410
but they're often recombining
trees. Oh. So if I ask, by the way,

654
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:12,020
in this tree,
whatever the opinion is here,

655
00:42:12,021 --> 00:42:16,210
which turns out to be 0.68 something,
yeah,

656
00:42:16,211 --> 00:42:18,710
I should have asked you
to guess 0.68 something.

657
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:22,790
If you write down in the opinion that
opinion has to be the average of the

658
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:26,300
opinion here and the opinion here.
So if I take the opinion here at times,

659
00:42:26,301 --> 00:42:31,301
0.6 plus the opinion here at times 0.4
that's also going to equal 0.68 okay.

660
00:42:32,871 --> 00:42:36,350
And that's what's going to be the key to
computing the thing much faster rather

661
00:42:36,351 --> 00:42:39,320
than going through every branch,
which is such a pain. Okay.

662
00:42:39,321 --> 00:42:44,321
So because they're an
exponential exponential number
of exponentially growing,

663
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,800
growing number of pads,

664
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:52,430
very bad to have to compute by hand.

665
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,970
But we noticed that we could
look at a recombining tree.

666
00:42:58,730 --> 00:42:59,450
Okay.

667
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:02,630
Okay. The, the, these two
nodes are essentially the same.

668
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:07,840
What difference does it make if the
Yankees win one and lose one or lose one.

669
00:43:08,061 --> 00:43:13,061
And when one in both cases they're
there at the same spot there even in the

670
00:43:13,731 --> 00:43:14,564
world series.

671
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:19,070
And since we assume the probability of
winning and game is the same 0.6 and 0.4

672
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:21,590
independent of what's happened before,
you might think you're learning,

673
00:43:21,591 --> 00:43:25,430
you know something about all their starter
pitched here and you know he didn't

674
00:43:25,431 --> 00:43:28,250
last the whole game and stuff like that.
So I'm, I'm not allowing for any of that.

675
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:31,790
I'm just saying it's a 0.6 0.4 chance
for the Yankees to win no matter what

676
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:32,624
happens.

677
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:37,550
So all you care about at any point
from then on is what the s who's one,

678
00:43:37,551 --> 00:43:38,420
how many games.

679
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:42,680
So these nodes are basically identical
and these nodes are identical because it

680
00:43:42,681 --> 00:43:44,210
all ended up with the Yankees.

681
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:47,030
The Dodgers ahead two to one and
here the Yankees were head to,

682
00:43:47,031 --> 00:43:49,790
to one near the Yankees were ahead,
three to zero and zero to three.

683
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,530
So the recombining tree,

684
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:55,160
which has all the same
information is just this,

685
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:00,430
this,
this.

686
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:12,200
Okay, this tree. So this tree
only has one, two, three,
four, five you know, has far,

687
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:16,580
you know, it's one node, two
nodes, three nodes, and four nodes.

688
00:44:16,581 --> 00:44:21,581
As time goes by growing linearly instead
of growing one to two to four to eight,

689
00:44:22,281 --> 00:44:23,630
which is growing exponentially.

690
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:28,520
So I could have a very long world series
and write it as a finite tree and just

691
00:44:28,521 --> 00:44:32,550
point 0.6 and 0.4 here at every stage.

692
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,290
Okay, so how am I going to
solve this? Now we'll over here.

693
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:42,900
I know the Yankees ended up
winning all three games here.

694
00:44:42,901 --> 00:44:46,830
They want to hear they won one here,
they one nuns. So those are the outcomes.

695
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:51,630
So instead of trying to figure out path
by path who these exponential number of

696
00:44:51,631 --> 00:44:54,690
pads, what the chances of each path
or why there's hard to compute here.

697
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:59,310
It's 0.6 times 0.6 times point
for the complicated calculation.

698
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,010
Okay,
I'm not going to do something simple.

699
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:05,580
I'm going to say what would I think if
the Yankees had already won two games?

700
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,440
Well I know that they would win. Okay,
that's a one. That series is already over.

701
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:15,000
What would I think after the Dodgers won
the first two games? I know it was over.

702
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:18,120
What would I see?
And so how did I get that?

703
00:45:18,121 --> 00:45:22,380
Is Point six times one plus 0.4 times one.
That's one.

704
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:27,450
The Dodgers 0.6 times zero plus
0.4 times zero. That's zero. Okay,

705
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,690
so that's my opinion.
If the Dodgers win two games,

706
00:45:30,691 --> 00:45:33,210
here's my opinion of the Dodgers
and the Yankees won two games.

707
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,650
What's my opinion? What would my opinion
be if they split? Well, if they split,

708
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:38,880
what would my opinion be?

709
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,220
Okay,

710
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:44,650
if I started here. So after game
two they've each one one game,

711
00:45:44,651 --> 00:45:47,590
I don't know who won the first one,
but it was one to one after two games.

712
00:45:47,591 --> 00:45:51,650
Now what would I think
exactly?

713
00:45:51,651 --> 00:45:55,670
So it's 0.6 it's 0.6 times one
plus 0.4 times zero. So the odds,

714
00:45:55,671 --> 00:45:59,180
I would think the Yankees would win the
world series here with one game left

715
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:00,980
knowing that they win 60% of the time.

716
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:06,130
It's a 0.6 but now what do I think
if the Yankees win the first game?

717
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,340
What's my opinion?

718
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:10,910
Okay.

719
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:15,910
So it's 0.6 times one so it's 0.6 plus
0.4 times 0.6 that's 0.24 so that's 0.84

720
00:46:18,921 --> 00:46:19,754
here.

721
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:24,830
And what's my opinion after the Yankees
lose the first game and the Dodgers win,

722
00:46:24,831 --> 00:46:26,300
what do I think is going to happen?

723
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,720
What might,
what would my opinion be here?

724
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:40,360
It's 0.6 times having an opinion of
0.6 so it's 0.36 loss 0.4 times knowing

725
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:46,250
that's all over plus 0.4 times zero.

726
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:48,410
So it's equal to 0.36.

727
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,050
Okay. So that's, that's,

728
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:57,520
that's so I've now figured out not only
am I solving this thing much faster than

729
00:46:57,521 --> 00:46:58,390
I could over there,

730
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:01,900
but I'm finding interesting numbers on
the way I'm now figuring out what would I

731
00:47:01,901 --> 00:47:03,730
think after the Yankees
won the first game.

732
00:47:03,731 --> 00:47:07,540
Well now I think it's 84% what would I
think after the Dodgers won the first

733
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:11,680
game, I think it was only 36%
chance of the Yankees winning. Okay.

734
00:47:11,681 --> 00:47:13,720
And so now what's my opinion
at the very beginning?

735
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:16,720
Okay,

736
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:21,620
it's 0.6 times point 84 it's my
chance of having this opinion.

737
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:26,480
Plus my chance of having that
opinion plus 0.4 times 0.36

738
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,460
um oh no,

739
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:38,890
a five oh four maybe plus 2144

740
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:44,780
what is that?
Six four

741
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,960
wearing six 48 six times 84 looks like
five Oh four and four times 36 and it's

742
00:47:51,571 --> 00:47:56,070
like one 44 so looks like 0.648 gave
me, that's what you said. So that's it.

743
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:59,400
I've solved it now.
Okay.

744
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:03,000
So that's the method of
iterated expectation.

745
00:48:03,001 --> 00:48:06,450
And we're going to turn this into quite
an interesting theory in a second,

746
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,830
but I want to now put that on the
computer to show you just how completely

747
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:13,860
obvious this is. I mean, not obvious fast.

748
00:48:13,861 --> 00:48:18,630
This is so you could solve
for any number of uh,

749
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:20,410
yeah,

750
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:25,030
a series of any length you could instantly
solve. Okay. And now we're going to,

751
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:28,060
we're going to price bonds that way too.
So class.

752
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:36,863
Okay.

753
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:42,970
Okay. So what did I do? I,
this is a spreadsheet you had,

754
00:48:42,971 --> 00:48:46,210
I simply had the probabilities
of the Yankees winning,

755
00:48:46,211 --> 00:48:50,290
which was 0.6 which I could change.
Oh,

756
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:19,410
okay.
So this is the simplest thing to do,

757
00:49:19,411 --> 00:49:21,960
but now suppose that,
okay,

758
00:49:21,961 --> 00:49:26,130
so we said the Yankees can win every game
with probability 0.6 so then what did

759
00:49:26,131 --> 00:49:30,420
I do? I went down to here,
I gave myself some room.

760
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,220
I didn't do very a very long series.
So now what does each of these things say?

761
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:39,990
Each of these nodes like that one
says, if I can read it, it says,

762
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,870
so this is my opinion of winning
the world series. It says,

763
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:47,970
my opinion here is going to be the chance
I go up. Okay, that's the probability.

764
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,140
That's a two.

765
00:49:49,141 --> 00:49:54,141
That's 0.6 the chance I go up times what
my opinion would be over here plus the

766
00:49:54,931 --> 00:49:58,800
chance that I go down, which
is here, chance I go to here,

767
00:49:58,801 --> 00:50:02,850
which is one minus that number
0.6 that's frozen up their times.

768
00:50:02,851 --> 00:50:06,810
Whatever I thought would be my opinion
here. So you see that's the same.

769
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:11,340
I just write that once I wrote
that one's here. That thing about,

770
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:15,810
you know the probability, my opinion
there is the probability of going up.

771
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:20,820
That's s a dollar a dollar too.
That's 0.6. It's frozen times,

772
00:50:20,821 --> 00:50:25,821
what my opinion would be on the square
over one and up one plus one minus dollar

773
00:50:26,701 --> 00:50:30,050
a two times my opinion
over one and down one.

774
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:34,490
So I just copied that as many times
as I want it to down the column.

775
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,830
And then I copied it again
across all the roads.

776
00:50:36,831 --> 00:50:40,160
So all of these entries are identical.
They're all just copies of each other.

777
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:44,960
Okay, so just as iterate your opinion
from what you know it was forward. Okay.

778
00:50:44,961 --> 00:50:49,820
Now how do I take a three game world
series? Well, we're starting here.

779
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:52,550
This will be one game,
one game two, game three.

780
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:57,850
So all I have to do now is put a
ones everywhere here like one enter.

781
00:50:59,121 --> 00:51:04,121
And now I'll copy this Schrole
copy and go all the way down here.

782
00:51:04,401 --> 00:51:07,610
Because when you, when you're
above the them. Okay, so that's it.

783
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:12,200
So we've got all the numbers. Okay. So
why is that? Because my opinion here,

784
00:51:12,201 --> 00:51:15,380
I remember the numbers, we got the game,
the series goes one game, two games,

785
00:51:15,381 --> 00:51:18,560
three games.
So if you end up above the middle,

786
00:51:18,561 --> 00:51:22,100
that means the Yankees won the majority
of gains. Your payoff is one. Okay.

787
00:51:22,101 --> 00:51:24,830
Your probability of the
Yankees winning is one. Okay.

788
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:29,310
And so now what's your opinion
going to be? Um, you know,

789
00:51:29,311 --> 00:51:32,910
if you've won two games then the
Yankees have to have one. Okay.

790
00:51:32,911 --> 00:51:35,820
What if the Yankees Win the first game?
Well, there you remember the numbers.

791
00:51:35,821 --> 00:51:40,560
We've got 1.6 and zero.
So here's the 0.84 is the average of 1.6.

792
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:45,860
Here's the 0.36 which was the
average of a 0.6 and zero.

793
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,900
And then we come down to the middle,
which is 0.648. Okay. So it's a,

794
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:54,570
what do I do if I want to play
a seven game world series? Okay.

795
00:51:54,571 --> 00:51:58,920
I have to get rid of this. Uh, and
if it's a seven game world series,

796
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,980
I would just now I want to
restore what I had before.

797
00:52:01,981 --> 00:52:05,400
So I'm going to copy
all this, uh, control.

798
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:07,940
Oh,
copy.

799
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:13,150
Okay. So I'm back to where I was
before. So this was basically,

800
00:52:13,151 --> 00:52:16,420
you see what I'm doing here. This is game.
Hasn't started. This is the first game,

801
00:52:16,421 --> 00:52:20,650
second game, third game, fourth
game, fifth gang, 16 seventh game.

802
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:22,270
Every square is just saying,

803
00:52:22,271 --> 00:52:25,330
my opinion is my average of what
my opinion will be next time.

804
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:29,260
If I want to make it a seven game
world series, I just plug in ones here.

805
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:34,090
There must be some faster way of doing
this, but I plug in ones here. So control,

806
00:52:34,091 --> 00:52:37,480
copy and here are all the
ones down to above the thing.

807
00:52:37,481 --> 00:52:39,880
Control v and now I've,

808
00:52:39,881 --> 00:52:44,350
I've solved my opinion backwards and I've
got the chances of the Yankees winning

809
00:52:44,351 --> 00:52:48,280
a seven game world series or 71% so
the longer the world series goes,

810
00:52:48,281 --> 00:52:52,270
the better the chances are the Yankees
win if they're better in each individual

811
00:52:52,271 --> 00:52:55,720
game and you can do it instantly.
So there are any questions about that.

812
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:58,771
Okay,

813
00:52:58,771 --> 00:53:03,630
so that is a trick we're going to use
over and over again to price bonds.

814
00:53:03,631 --> 00:53:07,680
You do it by backward induction because
of the law of iterated expectations.

815
00:53:07,681 --> 00:53:11,760
Your opinion today of what's going to
happen way in the future when you get a

816
00:53:11,761 --> 00:53:16,761
lot of information has to be the average
opinion you're going to have after you

817
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:19,950
get some information. But before
you know what the final outcome is.

818
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:23,580
And so realizing that you just take the
pieces of information one by one and

819
00:53:23,581 --> 00:53:27,870
worked backwards from the end and you
solve things instantly, which would take,

820
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:28,291
you know,

821
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:33,291
in the brute force way an exponentially
growing length of time to do if you did

822
00:53:33,361 --> 00:53:38,070
an path by path. Okay. So let's now,

823
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:39,023
um,

824
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:43,260
I want now I want to turn to an
application of this to one subject,

825
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:48,570
which is let's just not do
the world series. Let's do
a more interesting problem.

826
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,570
I hope I have time to finish the story.

827
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:59,220
Okay. So the more interesting
problems, this let's suppose that

828
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,030
the,
uh,

829
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:08,800
let's suppose our uncertainties
of a different kind

830
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:13,660
instead of not knowing the
outcome of the world series.

831
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:16,810
Let's say we don't know
how impatient we are.

832
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:22,030
So remember that most important idea so
far that we've seen because we haven't

833
00:54:22,031 --> 00:54:25,960
done uncertainty yet. Most important
idea we've seen so far is impatience.

834
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,510
That's the reason why you have to,

835
00:54:28,511 --> 00:54:32,170
you get an interest rate and the interest
rate is the key to finding out the

836
00:54:32,171 --> 00:54:33,250
value of everything.

837
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:38,580
So Irving Fisher put tremendous weight
on impatience and now that we're talking

838
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,700
about uncertainty,

839
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:43,720
the natural thing to make uncertain
is how impatient you are going to be.

840
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:47,590
So we want to talk a little
bit more about impatience.

841
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:51,500
So impatience.

842
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,430
Okay,

843
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:56,320
why Irving Fisher is the discount.

844
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:05,490
So I, in fact I want to talk about
this in sort of realistic terms.

845
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:09,660
Do we really believe that people just
discount the future? You know that they,

846
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:12,720
one year they discount by Delta two years,

847
00:55:12,721 --> 00:55:15,980
they just can't buy Delta squared
three years by Delta cubed,

848
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,090
four years by Delta to the fourth.

849
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:23,330
Is it really true that every year people
think of as Delta less important as the

850
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,353
year before?

851
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,150
Okay.

852
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:30,560
I mean the arguments for that is, you
know, you might not live beyond a certain,

853
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:34,010
you know, the poor at
imagination. So imagination,

854
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:37,400
poor imagination.
We've said this before,

855
00:55:37,401 --> 00:55:41,630
per imagination and mortality are
the two arguments for discounting.

856
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:45,320
But let me tell a story that
seems to contradict that.

857
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:50,960
Suppose someone asks you to clean your
room and they give you a choice of doing

858
00:55:50,961 --> 00:55:55,250
it. I'm thinking of my son for example,
say clean your room Constantine.

859
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,353
And uh,

860
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:01,340
so if I say do it today or do it tomorrow,

861
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:03,680
that makes a huge difference to him.
I mean,

862
00:56:03,681 --> 00:56:06,800
just a huge difference doing
it today for doing it tomorrow.

863
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:11,370
He'll think doing it today is just
impossible doing it tomorrow, you know,

864
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:14,330
I can almost force him
into agreeing to that.

865
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:17,330
So clearly there's a big discount
between today and tomorrow.

866
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,280
But what about between today?

867
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:23,180
What about between a year from
now and a year and a day from now?

868
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:27,160
Do you think Constantino think there's
any difference from that in that?

869
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:31,410
And the answer is no. He just,
you know, if I say Constantine,

870
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,740
you agree to clean it a year,

871
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:37,720
365 days from now or 366 days from now
to him, there's hardly any difference.

872
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,270
But you know,
there's hardly any trade off.

873
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:42,220
One is hardly more valuable
than the other. Of course.

874
00:56:42,221 --> 00:56:43,420
The both pretty unimportant,

875
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:46,120
but the ratio of the two doesn't
even seem important to him.

876
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,670
So that's called hyperbolic discounting.

877
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:53,760
If you do any experiment
with people or with um,

878
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:59,560
with people or with animals,
you know, you add, you, you,

879
00:56:59,561 --> 00:57:03,430
you make a bird do something and
you know, he, if he does more stuff,

880
00:57:03,431 --> 00:57:05,770
he gets the things faster.
You know,

881
00:57:05,771 --> 00:57:08,890
he'll do a lot of stuff to get it in
the next minute as opposed to in two

882
00:57:08,891 --> 00:57:11,800
minutes. But the amount
that hit, but, but he won't,

883
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:15,610
the difference between what he'll do
in 10 minutes versus 11 minutes is very

884
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:20,110
small. Okay. So hyperbolic
discounting is quite, is uh,

885
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,150
is discounting

886
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:29,580
march hyperbolic discounting
is discounting much less

887
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:32,920
Len exponential discounting.

888
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:39,020
So this has a tremendous importance for

889
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,810
the environment. If you fought that people
exponentially discounted, like they,

890
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:50,040
they fund each year was only 95% as if
the interest rate's 5% it sounds like the

891
00:57:50,121 --> 00:57:51,920
discounting is 0.95.

892
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:55,490
So if next year's only 95% is important
as this year and the year after,

893
00:57:55,491 --> 00:57:59,390
that is only 95% is
important as the first year.

894
00:57:59,391 --> 00:58:04,391
And the third year is only
95% is important as a second
year 0.95 in a hundred

895
00:58:04,611 --> 00:58:07,580
years to the hundredth is
an incredibly small number.

896
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,760
So there's no point in doing something
today and investing a lot of resources in

897
00:58:13,071 --> 00:58:16,130
order to clean up the environment and
help people a hundred years from now.

898
00:58:16,131 --> 00:58:20,120
Because by discounting at
this much, nobody could. You
know what's the difference?

899
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:21,800
Because the future so unimportant,

900
00:58:21,801 --> 00:58:24,680
you shouldn't be investing resources
now to do something that's going to have

901
00:58:24,681 --> 00:58:28,910
such a small effect later.
So in all the reports on the environment,

902
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:33,830
a crucial half of the report is devoted
to what the discount rate should be.

903
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:38,690
So, but they never thought of
doing the most obvious thing,

904
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:43,070
which is to ask what would happen
if the discounting was uncertain.

905
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,200
All of these are certain discount rates.

906
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:49,790
So what if you made the the discounting
uncertain? What would you imagine doing?

907
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:55,040
So suppose you discount today at 100%
and maybe next period you're going to

908
00:58:55,041 --> 00:59:00,041
discount at 200% this is the interest
rate and hearing it might go down to 50%

909
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:06,290
could go up to 400% or it could,
could,

910
00:59:06,291 --> 00:59:10,700
could go down to 100% again.
Okay.

911
00:59:10,701 --> 00:59:14,990
Or it could go down to 25% and all this
kind of discounting I have in mind,

912
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:17,271
you don't know.

913
00:59:17,271 --> 00:59:22,271
So delta equals one over
one plus r and this is our,

914
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:28,070
our zero are up or down.
Okay.

915
00:59:28,071 --> 00:59:32,150
So maybe the, maybe the discount
is uncertain and it goes like that.

916
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:35,000
So it's a geometric random walk.

917
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:38,930
I keep multiplying or dividing by two.
I multiply or divide by two.

918
00:59:38,931 --> 00:59:43,210
I multiply or divide by two. That
seems to make for a lot of discounting,

919
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:47,120
these numbers are going up very fast. It
seems like, you know, the higher the are,

920
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:48,950
the less you care about the future.

921
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:53,720
So the question is if you ask for
a dollar sometime in the future,

922
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:58,940
what will people be willing to
pay for it? Okay. So how, I mean,

923
00:59:59,030 --> 00:59:59,780
so you know,

924
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:04,580
you know today that you think the
future is only half as important as the

925
01:00:04,581 --> 01:00:06,980
present. Let's say these
all have probability a half,

926
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:14,620
okay. And tomorrow it might be that you
think the future is only two thirds.

927
01:00:14,621 --> 01:00:16,790
The next years only two
thirds is important as the,

928
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:21,930
that current year or you might think the
future's only one third as as important

929
01:00:22,031 --> 01:00:23,890
as this year.
So you'll see how this is working.

930
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:28,330
Two years from now you might think the
future is only one fifth as the third

931
01:00:28,331 --> 01:00:31,040
years, only one fifth is
importance. The second year here.

932
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:34,660
Or you might think the third years is
half as important as the second year here.

933
01:00:34,661 --> 01:00:39,520
Or you might think it's a four fifths
is important as the third year. Okay,

934
01:00:39,521 --> 01:00:41,560
so you don't know what it's going to be.
And if anything,

935
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:44,200
this process seems to give you a,

936
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:47,890
this process seems to give you a bias
towards getting really high numbers. Okay.

937
01:00:47,891 --> 01:00:52,300
High discounts, meaning the
future doesn't matter. Okay. So,

938
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:56,260
but nobody bothered to stop.
So this is the most,

939
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:59,540
this is the most famous interest
rate process and finance.

940
01:00:59,541 --> 01:01:02,950
This is called the whole
Lee interest rate model.

941
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:08,640
Where are you think today's interest rate
might be 4% maybe it'll get multiple,

942
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:11,350
maybe only 10% higher next year,
a 10% lower.

943
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,010
It'll keep going up and down like that.

944
01:01:13,011 --> 01:01:14,830
And that's the uncertainty
about the interest rate.

945
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,610
So if we think interest rates are so
important in patients is so important and

946
01:01:18,611 --> 01:01:22,360
we want to add uncertainty first place
to do it as to the interest rate and the

947
01:01:22,361 --> 01:01:24,160
holy model and finance does that.

948
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:27,790
Nobody bothered to compute
this out more than 30 years.

949
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,540
Okay. Suppose you computed,
okay, compute what out.

950
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:38,580
Suppose you get a dollar
for sure in year one. Okay.

951
01:01:38,581 --> 01:01:41,970
How much would you pay for
a dollar in year one? Well,

952
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:44,760
your discount is 100%
you pay a half a dollar.

953
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:48,510
How much would you pay
for a dollar in year two?

954
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,150
A dollar in year two.
Well,

955
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:55,290
you know how much more dollar now
is worth than a year from now,

956
01:01:55,291 --> 01:01:57,180
but you don't know two years from now.

957
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:59,910
So you have to work by
backward induction here.

958
01:01:59,911 --> 01:02:01,860
A dollar for sure is worth a dollar.

959
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:04,860
What would I pay for it here
I pay a third of a dollar.

960
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:10,020
Okay, and what would I pay for it
here? Well, the discount is two thirds.

961
01:02:10,021 --> 01:02:14,700
I paid two thirds of a dollar.
So what would I pay for it back here,

962
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:19,850
I pay half times a third plus half times
two thirds discounted a hundred percent

963
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:22,900
so that's some low.
So it's a half cents.

964
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:27,000
One third plus a one sixth,

965
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:31,770
which is a half times a half,
which is a quarter I guess. Okay.

966
01:02:31,771 --> 01:02:32,820
So I pay a quarter.

967
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:37,940
So for any time I could
figure out DFT equals amount,

968
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:43,320
I would pay him. I'm going to be done
in one minute amount. I would pay today,

969
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:49,760
today for $1 for sure at time t

970
01:02:55,140 --> 01:03:00,120
and that number obviously is
going to go down as t goes up. So,

971
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:03,690
and we know how to compute
it by backward induction.

972
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:06,630
You just put the ones further and
further out and then you go backwards by

973
01:03:06,631 --> 01:03:09,090
backward deduction.
But just like for the world series,

974
01:03:09,091 --> 01:03:11,910
I could do that for any tea.
However big I want to.

975
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:15,030
And on a computer and the
spreadsheet which I wrote for you,

976
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:17,430
you could do this instantly.
Okay.

977
01:03:17,431 --> 01:03:21,720
And nobody bothered to do this for tea
bigger than 30 because bonds basically,

978
01:03:21,721 --> 01:03:23,220
we don't last for more than 30 years.

979
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:26,520
So what's the point in doing it for
p bigger than 30 so a hundred years.

980
01:03:26,521 --> 01:03:29,370
There are virtually no financial
instruments that are a hundred years long.

981
01:03:29,371 --> 01:03:32,820
So they didn't bother to do this.
Suppose you did it for every t you know,

982
01:03:32,821 --> 01:03:36,300
up to a thousand years. While you
can do it on a computer very easily,

983
01:03:36,301 --> 01:03:40,470
you can even prove a theorem of what
it's like. So in the problem set,

984
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:45,150
I'm going to ask you to do a few of these
and what you're going to find is that,

985
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:46,473
um,

986
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:51,210
people are hyperbolic that
you get your discount a lot.

987
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:54,180
Like it's pretty close to a hundred
percent for the first few periods.

988
01:03:54,181 --> 01:03:57,240
But after that,
you're going to be anyway,

989
01:03:57,241 --> 01:03:59,670
you're going to find out what the numbers
turn out to be when you do it in a

990
01:03:59,671 --> 01:04:01,470
computer.
Okay?

991
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:05,640
So we're gonna start with random
interest rates next period.

992
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:07,920
The most important
variable in the economy.
