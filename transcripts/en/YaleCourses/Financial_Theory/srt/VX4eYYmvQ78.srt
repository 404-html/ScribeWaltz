1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,680
So for you, for those of you
who weren't here yesterday,

2
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:07,560
I'll just say a couple words
or last class, first class.

3
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:12,090
I'll say a couple words about
what a happen basically forwards.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,410
The course is really made up
of four different elements.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,650
The first part is the standard financial
theory course that grew up in the last

6
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:27,351
10 years and a lot of major universities
pioneered by a bunch of guys who won

7
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:31,650
Nobel prizes in business schools.
And it's the method,

8
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:35,670
some of them quite clever and I
think fun methods for pricing,

9
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:38,640
financial assets and making
optimal financial decisions.

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,460
So you're going to learn
all these tricks and uh,

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,600
and how the financial system works and
you'll learn it both from a theoretical

12
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:49,770
point of view, the way they thought
of it in these finance schools. Uh,

13
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:52,260
and also from a practical point of view,
uh,

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,460
since many of these very same problems
come up all the time in the hedge fund,

15
00:00:56,461 --> 00:01:00,240
I helped start, but then the, the, so
that'll be the main part of the course.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,890
But there are three other things that I
want to concentrate on in the course. Uh,

17
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:09,390
so the second point is reexamining the
logic of laissez faire and regulation.

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,250
This is a dramatic moment in our history
now where there's tremendous pressure

19
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,890
on temporarily anyway,

20
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,210
on the government to establish
all sorts of new regulations.

21
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,810
There's also tremendous resistance to
establishing the new sorts of regulations.

22
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:28,110
So there's a debate going on
now in Congress and in the,

23
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,550
in the halls of academia about what kind
of regulations should we put in place,

24
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:35,760
what regulations would have,
would have prevented the crisis.

25
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:37,410
We've just lived through
the crisis by the way,

26
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:39,330
which I don't think we're done with yet.

27
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,180
So there's a very powerful
argument in economics.

28
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:45,230
The most famous argument
in economics, the, the,

29
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,350
the invisible hand argument that basically
says markets work best when they're

30
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:52,140
not encumbered by
government interventions.

31
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,980
So we're going to reexamine that argument
in the context of financial markets.

32
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,150
Then the third thing I'm going to discuss
in this course at some length is the

33
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,390
mortgage market and the
recent crisis after all,

34
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,760
my hedge fund is a mortgage hedge fund.

35
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,590
We founded it in 1994,
by the way,

36
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:11,770
which was,
uh,

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,450
the five years before that I was running
the fixed income research department at

38
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:19,380
kidder Peabody, which was the biggest
player in the mortgage market.

39
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:22,350
Then on the sell side that
hedge funds by mortgages,

40
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,650
investment banks create and
sell the mortgage securities.

41
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,330
So I was running the research
department at the firm that completely,

42
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,560
that did 20% of the market
and what's called Cmos. Um,

43
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,330
and then I changed to the buy side and
was at a hedge fund that bought those

44
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:44,070
kinds of cmos and bought subprime
mortgages, CDOs, everything. So,

45
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,620
uh, it seems, uh, you know,

46
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:51,621
I suffered greatly for the last two
years of the mortgage crisis and it,

47
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,070
it would just be foolish not to explain
what was going on and what it felt like

48
00:02:56,071 --> 00:03:00,280
to be in a mortgage hedge fund while the
rest of the world was collapsing around

49
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,260
us. And it, it for quite awhile.

50
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,100
It's given me some great embarrassment
to have been part of it all.

51
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,180
On the other hand, now I feel like one
of those survivors that, uh, you know,

52
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:11,014
hundreds of,

53
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,160
of our counterparties and a much bigger
mortgage players went out of business

54
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:21,850
and we didn't. And uh, so I don't feel
quite as bad about it as I did before.

55
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,420
Uh, and I don't know every detail of what
went on in my hedge fund because after

56
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:29,010
all, I'm only part time
there. But I, you know,

57
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,930
there's a lot I do know about and so
I'll try and tell you some of that.

58
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:35,140
And then the fourth thing
is social security. Uh,

59
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:39,860
this is the biggest government
program and it's also a, so,

60
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,040
and it's a,
it's a financial problem,

61
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:45,490
what to do about retirement and social
security is the biggest government

62
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:50,230
program of all, the only thing
close is the military budget.

63
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,960
And so in terms of annual expenditures,

64
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:55,900
and so I'm going to explain how that
works and what the problem is and how it

65
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:59,920
arose and what I think the solution is.
So those are the four things, of course,

66
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:02,920
is going to concentrate on the
mechanics of the course. Again,

67
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,750
our homeworks every week there's going
to be a homework with little problems

68
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:11,230
illustrating what we're talking
about. I think that, uh,

69
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:13,780
so there's one already on the web.
Tuesday today,

70
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:17,650
every Tuesday there'll be one on the web.
It will be due the next Tuesday. The,

71
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:22,090
the PR, the sections we'll always
meet between Thursday and Monday.

72
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:23,980
So the problem settle,
come Tuesday,

73
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,310
you'll have two days of classes on the
material that the problem said will cover

74
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,000
and then you can talk to
the tas about stuff, uh,

75
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,880
between Thursday and Tuesday
when I presume you'll do
the problem set and that's

76
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:36,550
20% of the grade.
20% is the first midterm,

77
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:41,020
20% is the second midterm and
40% is the final. You know,

78
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:44,530
two midterms takes a lot of
class time on the other hand.

79
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,350
And it also takes a tremendous
amount of effort by the Tas.

80
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,760
And so I appreciate their
willingness to grade two midterms,

81
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:56,110
but I think you'll find it's helpful
to study the course and two pieces then

82
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:58,000
tried to do the whole thing or you know,
it's just,

83
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,170
it would be much better for you. I found
in the past they have two midterms. Um,

84
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,820
okay. So that's uh, uh, pretty
much oh and one warning.

85
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,320
The course doesn't require
difficult mathematics, but for me,

86
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:12,670
as I said in the first class,

87
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,700
it's very interesting that there's so
many subtle things that affect a financial

88
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:22,750
decision and you have to think about what
you know and all the different things.

89
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:23,051
You know,

90
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:25,870
you have to think about what the other
guy knows who's taking the other side of

91
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:29,260
the market. You have to think about
what he knows about what you know.

92
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,900
And you have to think about what he
knows about what you know about what he

93
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:35,800
knows. And all that thing in the end
boils down to one number, the price.

94
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,960
So it's, it's a, it's a philosophically
interesting problem. You know,

95
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,540
interactive epistemologies.

96
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,790
Some people have described economics
is interactive with epistemology.

97
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,590
It's more complicated than standard
epistemology and philosophy because there,

98
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,810
there were there, you know, they,

99
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:54,060
they go in circles thinking
about what one person knows,

100
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,830
whether you can know that, you know,
and stuff like that. In economics,

101
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:58,550
you have worry about what,
you know, what the other guy,

102
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:01,550
he knows what you know about what he knows
about what, you know, it's, it's, it's,

103
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,010
so it's a,

104
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,240
it's a more complex problem and yet at
the end there's just one number which can

105
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:08,810
be right or wrong. And so, uh,
when I was a freshman here at Yale,

106
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:11,750
my roommate who was a classics
major said that, you know,

107
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,310
his subject was much easier and much
harder than mine. That was math because,

108
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,860
you know, all I had to
do was be right. And, uh,

109
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,090
so I'm going to take advantage of that
simplicity and there's going to be,

110
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,970
every problem is going to have a
number that you're supposed to find.

111
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:29,030
And so it's not a complicated mathematics,

112
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:32,900
but it's involves lots of numbers.
And so if you hate numbers,

113
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,940
you shouldn't take this course.
And as I said before,

114
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:38,900
there's always been people who,
you know, you can be very smart,

115
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:43,550
you can also have a great future and
finance and not like numbers. So,

116
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,670
um, you know, you can make like
making deals and things like that.

117
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:49,470
Not Thinking in terms of numbers. So
just because you don't like numbers and,

118
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,030
and maybe shouldn't take this course
doesn't mean you should be discouraged

119
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:53,670
about finance.

120
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,810
It's just how I happen to teach the course
because that's what's comfortable for

121
00:06:56,811 --> 00:07:00,410
me. So I'm just warning you about it. It
won't be hard, but there'll be relentless.

122
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,200
Okay. So, um,

123
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,500
I want to talk today about that second
problem about the logic of the free

124
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:12,740
market. And to do that, I'm going
to have to introduce a model.

125
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:15,650
So it raises the question of
what is a model in economics.

126
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:19,310
So many of you have taken economics
before you sort of know what this idea is,

127
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,700
but I think it's worth spending a
minute on it because it represented a

128
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:25,190
revolution in thought.
So for an economist,

129
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:30,191
a model means you distinguished exogenous
variables from endogenous variables,

130
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,870
the exogenous things
people can't control their,

131
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:35,150
just the weather and things like that.
Uh,

132
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,420
the endogenous variables are things
they can control and you're trying to

133
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:42,590
predict what the indulgence variables
are going to turn out to be like,

134
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:46,160
what are the prices be? What are the
consumption's B things like that.

135
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,980
How much income will people have?
Most of the indogenous variables.

136
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,350
So you have a theory,
which,

137
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,350
so the theory is it's couched
in terms of equilibrium.

138
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,010
There's a bunch of equations
which have to be satisfied.

139
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,900
F of Enx. So given the endogenous
variables and they exogenous variables,

140
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,570
exogenous and endogenous,
I wrote them in that order.

141
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,530
There's a set of simultaneous equations,
F that have to be satisfied.

142
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,700
And so you find Ecqua Librium when
given the exogenous variables,

143
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,550
e you find the endogenous variables,

144
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,120
x of t that solve that system
will simultaneous equations.

145
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,930
All our equilibrium models are
going to have that form. Um,

146
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,470
and one very important
thing they allow you to do,

147
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:30,410
which is the heart of economic analysis,
is comparative statics.

148
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:35,411
If you change the exogenous variable e
it will require in different x to change

149
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,930
to, to, to, to, uh, solve the
equations. So he has an effect, uh,

150
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:44,690
on x in order to restore equilibrium.

151
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,760
And so the prediction that had changed
and he has a certain effect on x is

152
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:51,530
called comparative statics.
Now,

153
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,530
how would a historian described
that a historian would say, well,

154
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:57,300
that's reasoning.
The environment is easy.

155
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,450
Why are you bothering to tell me about
what would happen if the environment

156
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:04,560
change from e to e prime? Well,
that's the heart of economic analysis.

157
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:07,920
So in history, you hardly
ever get much. You know,

158
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,070
people talk about it a little just
to raise the question, you know,

159
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,460
how would the Vietnam war have gone
if Kennedy hadn't been assassinated?

160
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,730
So they all bring that up, but then they'd
be, you know, you get two sentences,

161
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,570
all he was really gonna pull out, or
oh, he had been sending more advisors.

162
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:24,060
He was going to, you know, it would
have gone the same way. That's about it.

163
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,081
In economics,

164
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:29,100
the heart of the thing is to go off on
a tangent and figure out what would have

165
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:33,000
happened if the environment had
been different. So, you know,

166
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:34,470
why do a model well,

167
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,390
because many different such settings
can be described by the same model.

168
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:44,370
So it just saves time. It makes
things much simpler. Um, it, uh,

169
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,780
you know, from the, the counterfactual
reasoning, you're making predictions.

170
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,060
It helps your understanding.
And,

171
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,460
and then for the purposes
of the next few lectures,

172
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:56,490
the most important thing is you,
there are some properties of equilibrium,

173
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:57,540
like for example,

174
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:01,410
equilibrium is so good you wouldn't want
to interfere with echo Librium because

175
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,610
it makes everyone so well off and there'd
be a terrible thing to regulate. Uh,

176
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:08,820
so those properties of equilibrium rule,
we have to test the logic of,

177
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:13,530
so there's an obvious critique.
You can make them have a modeling.

178
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,820
The first person, uh, to make
a model was, was Ricardo,

179
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,270
who you I'm sure have heard of the
principle of comparative advantage.

180
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:25,350
And he wrote, he was the first guy who
didn't write verbally. He said, okay,

181
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:28,770
I'm talking about international trade
and why free trade is a good idea.

182
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,560
I could make a verbal argument
that's what everyone else has done,

183
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,400
but I'm not going to do it. I'm going
to say, suppose that England produced,

184
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:39,900
you know, with one hour of labor,
three bottles of wine and, and uh,

185
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:43,950
and so on. And he had a little, a
numerical example and he solved it.

186
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:47,520
And he showed that in that numerical
example, it's better to have free trade.

187
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,340
As paradoxical as it might have
sounded at the time, you know,

188
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:54,570
the Portuguese had such higher,
such lower labor costs. You know,

189
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:58,080
why shouldn't English workers be afraid
of being thrown out of their jobs when

190
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,530
trading with Portugal where the Labor
was so much less expensive? Well,

191
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:04,800
we explained why that turned out not to
be the case, but in terms of a model.

192
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,720
So malfa so you've also heard of a,
a contemporary of his and his rival,

193
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:11,580
but also his friend said,
you know,

194
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:15,600
this model stuff is ridiculous because
if you start making a model, you know,

195
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:19,290
the point of a model is to make
deductions from it and to analyze it,

196
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,560
analyze it deeper and deeper and deeper.
And of course the model to begin with,

197
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:23,550
it's going to be wrong.

198
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,010
And as you go deeper and deeper
in the analysis of the model,

199
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:29,160
the error that you made at the
beginning is going to get compounded.

200
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,490
Like he said, the Taylors
of Lacuna, you know,

201
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:36,770
who buy a slight mistake at the outset,
you know, doing their stitches. Uh,

202
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,390
you know, go wrong. The stitch
goes further and further wrong,

203
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,270
arrive at conclusions,
the most distant from the truth anyway,

204
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:44,310
that's what you might
think is wrong with models.

205
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,760
And the very first model was
critiqued by that reasoning,

206
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,200
but it's turned out historically that
modeling is the way to make progress in

207
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:54,280
economics. And everybody
does modeling. Now,

208
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:58,240
you'll find out as I talk more about
it, that the Coles Foundation, uh,

209
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:02,770
which has been at Yale since 1955 was
founded by a Kohl's undergraduate.

210
00:12:02,771 --> 00:12:05,620
You'll hear the whole history of it.
I was the director of it for nine years.

211
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,120
That was the one most
important institution in the
world promoting the uses of

212
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:12,070
mathematics and economics. And it, it,

213
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:16,390
the revolution succeeded and now all
economists use models and mathematics.

214
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,840
Anyway, let's take an example
of the simplest model. You know,

215
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:24,730
there's so many different ways of
organizing price and trade. There's a,

216
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,640
you know, the, you had the supermarket,
the seller just sets the price.

217
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,590
You decide to buy it. If you go
to Jerusalem or something, you,

218
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,640
you in the Old City, you know that you're
haggling over everything. You know,

219
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:36,010
and every, you know, you offer
this and then the guy says no,

220
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:38,020
and you walk away and you come
back and it takes, you know,

221
00:12:38,021 --> 00:12:41,200
half a day to argue the price. But
that's another way of arguing the price,

222
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:41,771
you know,

223
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:45,720
then there's the government could set
the price and the Paris bourse the way it

224
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,470
worked is, um, you know,
there, there would be a, uh,

225
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:54,460
a temporary price set and then supply
and demand people would announce how much

226
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:57,730
they wanted to buy and a supply didn't
equal demand. The price would get changed.

227
00:12:57,731 --> 00:13:00,640
So it was tapped on woman's
groping and groping to the price.

228
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,140
There's the commodities futures,

229
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,950
just like the experiment we ran where
people yell at each other. There's a,

230
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:09,280
you know, computer bid, ask prices
where you do everything online.

231
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,160
There's the specialist
in the Stock Exchange,

232
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,020
there's one guy everybody has to come to.

233
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:17,140
And so he's responsible
for clearing the markets.

234
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,910
So I might affect, mentioned a little
bit of the history of the sort of thing.

235
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,260
Um, if I can hit escape, which
might be somewhat interesting.

236
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,303
Uh,

237
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,300
so the first people who had these well
developed markets and money where the

238
00:13:36,451 --> 00:13:38,280
Lydians and the,
you know,

239
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,630
they invented money in six 40 BC and
they had gold coins and you know,

240
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:44,040
with all this money in trading,

241
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:48,150
they got very quickly to gambling and
prostitution for money. And, uh, you know,

242
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:52,440
Midas, the midas touch was a,
everything turned to gold was Lydian.

243
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:57,570
Um, uh, they've, they've discovered
all these, uh, mince in, uh,

244
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,450
in, you know, where their capital was a,

245
00:14:00,451 --> 00:14:03,540
so they know that they were making all
this money and gold and stuff like that.

246
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,470
Uh, so they had open air markets, they
invented the retail markets. You know,

247
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:11,850
creases was one of the most famous, uh,
Lydian kings. And he's the guy, you know,

248
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,830
Richard's creases is a famous expression.

249
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,090
He's the one who went to
the Delphic oracle and asked
if he should fight the, uh,

250
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,700
great Persians, Cyrus the great,
and, uh, the Delphic oracle is usual,

251
00:14:23,701 --> 00:14:26,040
mysteriously say at a great
kingdom will be destroyed.

252
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,160
And since it was Cyrus the great,

253
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:31,860
he figured it must be Cyrus's and it was
his kingdom that was destroyed. Um, okay.

254
00:14:31,861 --> 00:14:35,020
So the Greeks copied a lot of that stuff.
They had their Agua raw,

255
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,500
which was the open market.
And um,

256
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,340
they had lots of trade and they
understood supply and demand. By the way,

257
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:45,960
this isn't a modern, uh, uh,
example in the, in the politics,

258
00:14:45,961 --> 00:14:49,440
there's a story of failure.
These who predicts a bad harvest.

259
00:14:49,441 --> 00:14:54,350
He's a great mathematician and he
predicts a bad harvest and he feel if he

260
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:58,290
figures, if he corners the wheat market,
he'll make a fortune when she does. Um,

261
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,360
Aristotle was famous for saying
money is a, just a convention.

262
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,680
It's not really worth anything.

263
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:06,710
People just agree it's worth something
even if it's just pieces of paper or

264
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:11,480
coins that's worth much more
than the coins. And how could
that be? And, um, anyway,

265
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:13,820
there's a long political
connection to that.

266
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:16,310
But the difference between
nature and convention to, anyhow,

267
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:20,930
he also said loaning it interest was,
was a unnatural and,

268
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:23,750
and terrible. But all the while
he was saying at the Delphic,

269
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:27,560
oracle was lending it. Interest
economics is a Greek word. You know,

270
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:31,320
household management. Xenophon wrote
a whole book about it. And one,

271
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,810
just one more little history, historical
thing. Hermes, the Messenger, God,

272
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:39,370
the God of information.
Um, so remember the,

273
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,160
the modern financial view of information
markets and information. Anyway,

274
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:44,720
he was the Greek God,
messenger,

275
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:48,800
God and God of information or commerce
comes from Hermes and the Romans who took

276
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:52,340
over the same uh,
God and called a Mercury's.

277
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,960
That's where we get the word
merchant from and market. Um,

278
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,760
anyway, uh, all right. I'm not
going to bother with all this,

279
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:05,540
but anyhow, so, all right, let's
do the history. I don't know,

280
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,340
I used to go on and on about this,
but anyway,

281
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:12,430
so the point is that in ancient times the
market was already established in this

282
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:15,410
idea of supply and demand
had already been created.

283
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:19,310
But there are many different
kinds of markets as we, uh,

284
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,190
as I've just said.
And they work in many different ways,

285
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:26,570
but we're going to describe
them in one, um, model.

286
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,320
So just to mention a couple
others, uh, the, the model that,

287
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,800
the experiment we ran in the class last
time, it's called the double auction.

288
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,050
And the experiment I told you about and
had you do was actually an experiment

289
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:43,310
that had, has been run before
and for the last 10 or 20 years,

290
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:45,620
many economists have run these
sorts of experiments, you know, for,

291
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:48,230
it's amazing that before that
was for 20 or 30 years ago,

292
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:49,460
no one thought to do that.
You know,

293
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:54,020
you didn't think that students with no
training and no experience could ever be

294
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:57,680
led to do something that was sensible.
But actually you did quite brilliantly.

295
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,650
And by the way, I've been told
that those of you who performed,

296
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,250
maybe you're still in the first two
rows, you have to sign a, you know,

297
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,430
even those of you who are left
at the end unable to trade,

298
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,640
you have to sign a release form so you
or disappointed you can't sue Gail for

299
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:16,550
you're disappointed faces appearing
on the Internet afterwards. So anyway,

300
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:19,490
the fact is we're going to see that
the people who were left at the end,

301
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:23,330
we're actually very rational.
In fact, nobody made a mistake.

302
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,770
I've done this experiment now 10 or 20
times and I would say that, you know,

303
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:30,980
half the time somebody buys something
for more than it's worth to them.

304
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,130
Nobody made a mistake and it almost
came out exactly as it should,

305
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,800
but we'll come to that in a second.
Anyway, that double auction, uh, is, uh,

306
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,880
the most complicated kind of auction.

307
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:43,430
But auctions have been
run for for a long time.

308
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,560
The first recorded auction you may
have heard about was Herat at us, uh,

309
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,760
describes the Babylonian
auction in 500 BC.

310
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:52,770
These are all going to be very
politically incorrect, but you know,

311
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,300
a lot of economics is politically
incorrect. Anyway, he just,

312
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,320
the first auction in 500 BC
was the Babylonians auction
off all the 18 year old

313
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:05,780
women as wives and they auction them
in order of most beautiful to lease

314
00:18:05,971 --> 00:18:06,511
beautiful.

315
00:18:06,511 --> 00:18:10,140
And so they got the very high price and
the price went down and down and down

316
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,120
until it hit zero. And then it started
going negative. But they use the revenue,

317
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:19,560
the first wives to subsidize the,
you know,

318
00:18:19,561 --> 00:18:24,030
husbands who would accept the other
wives as it kept going down the, the, uh,

319
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:28,860
the next most awful auction was the Roman
Empire itself was auction to offset.

320
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,400
If you saw the movie gladiator, you may
remember, uh, that Marcus are really,

321
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:38,401
this is the great emperor and he dies and
then the evil communist takes over and

322
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:43,200
you know, he dies in the, you
know, he dies as a gladiator there.

323
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,070
And then there's the senator he sorta
hardly ever see, but you know, you know,

324
00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:49,230
he's the good senator who somehow,
you know,

325
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,740
he appears a few times and you know that
he's a good guy and he's going to take

326
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:55,680
over. So his name is pertinent
acts and he does take over,

327
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,210
but he's a good guy and he gets killed
almost immediately by the Praetorian

328
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:02,730
guard and the Praetorian guard.
Then it doesn't know who to make emperor.

329
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:04,500
So they auction the whole empire off.

330
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:09,770
And so it's a bot by DDS Juliana's and
he doesn't last very long and he gets

331
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:15,180
killed. Two and the Roman legions come
back and kill him. So anyway, there was a,

332
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:19,320
I grew up in our band, Illinois and
he used to go to these livestock, uh,

333
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,140
auctions where they, you know,
they sell, they sell something,

334
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:25,380
they talk incredibly fascinating. I'm
picking, I'm going [inaudible] right.

335
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,960
Remember you don't talk like that and I
don't know how anybody could understand

336
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:30,450
them.
And then there's the famous slave auction,

337
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,180
so when they'd actually auctions
slaves, that would be, you know,

338
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:34,460
and you've seen it in the movies maybe.

339
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,550
And that's where the expression going
once, going twice, third last call going,

340
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:43,260
going, gone. That's what they used
to say at the slave auction. So the,

341
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:48,290
the double auction that we saw was kind
of what happened at the beginnings of

342
00:19:48,781 --> 00:19:52,140
the New York Stock Exchange.
The first traded securities,

343
00:19:52,141 --> 00:19:54,540
there are only five of them.
So how did they start?

344
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,190
There was the revolutionary war.

345
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,540
A lot of states had borrowed money and
issued their bonds and there are two

346
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:05,130
banks, Bank of New York and the National
Bank of the u s that issue bonds.

347
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,920
Those were the only tradable securities.

348
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,870
And so a bunch of states had issued
bonds. So what happened was, uh,

349
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:15,980
after the revolutionary
war, the, these nobody,

350
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,530
a lot of most people expected the
bonds wouldn't be paid back after all.

351
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:22,530
There was a huge expense fighting the
revolutionary war. These, you know,

352
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:24,990
the government didn't
have very much money. Um,

353
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:29,280
the price of the bonds had
already collapsed. And, uh,

354
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,030
Jefferson wanted the u s to just,
you know,

355
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:35,160
wanting to leave the states
and let them default.

356
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:39,420
And Hamilton said that that would
be terrible, that the, the, the,

357
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:43,200
the reputation of the country was going
to be made at what happened at the very

358
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:47,590
founding of the country. And it was
important that the u s never break debt.

359
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,390
So he persuaded Washington to have the
federal government by all the debt of the

360
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:55,090
states and basically pay it all off.

361
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:59,320
So none of the debts were broken.
Jefferson argued, that's crazy.

362
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,590
The people who originally
bought the bonds, who lent
the money to the government,

363
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,840
you know, the farmers who did it,
they didn't own the bonds anymore.

364
00:21:04,841 --> 00:21:07,830
They probably all sold it for
$20. It was all these, you know,

365
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,880
despicable speculators who held the bonds.

366
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:14,170
You're only going to enrich them by paying
them off. So he just wouldn't budge.

367
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:19,120
And finally, Hamilton's supposedly, this
is a famous story, I assume it's true. Uh,

368
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,700
Hamilton went to Washington and said,
all right,

369
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:25,030
move the capital from
New York to Washington.

370
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:29,350
That'll make Jefferson happy cause
near as dear Virginia. And in exchange,

371
00:21:29,351 --> 00:21:31,420
get him to concede that we
have to pay off the debt.

372
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:36,630
So Washington broker that deal and the
debt was paid and the u s since then has

373
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:39,220
never defaulted on its debt.
And you know,

374
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:43,060
that's virtually no other country
can say that. I mean, for example,

375
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:47,920
Russia has never paid a 30 year
debt. It always is defaulted. So, so,

376
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,840
so, and we'll come back to that a little
later when we talk about the crisis of,

377
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,590
of uh, uh, 97, 98. Anyway,

378
00:21:56,591 --> 00:21:58,270
so these five securities,

379
00:21:58,271 --> 00:22:02,410
three government bonds and these two from
the revolutionary war in two banks are

380
00:22:02,411 --> 00:22:06,640
the only security sold. And they used to
be sold every day in a double auction,

381
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:08,500
exactly as the kind that we described,

382
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:10,900
where people would yell and scream at
each other and the whole thing would be

383
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:12,820
over in a few minutes and
that would be it for the day.

384
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:15,610
And then the next day they would do the
same thing over and over again. Well,

385
00:22:15,611 --> 00:22:18,070
they had to stop that when,
uh,

386
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,630
Alexandra Dewar who is Hamilton's
assistant started, uh, you know,

387
00:22:22,631 --> 00:22:25,680
using his insight information about
whether the government was or wasn't going

388
00:22:25,681 --> 00:22:28,300
to make all its payments and whether
they're going to issue new bonds and stuff

389
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:31,600
like that. Uh, to try and
speculate on the market.

390
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,490
And he would do it all by borrowing.

391
00:22:33,491 --> 00:22:37,450
He'd borrow a huge amount of money and
with the borrowed money, he buy bonds.

392
00:22:37,451 --> 00:22:41,320
And if the price went against him, he'd
lose a lot more because he was leveraged.

393
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,350
And so it caused gigantic
gyrations in the market.

394
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:49,330
And the whole thing had to be, uh,
you know, changed and with, and uh,

395
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:53,590
it was no, it was made a much
smaller group of people and um,

396
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:57,250
you know, the, anyway, so, so
that was the beginnings of it.

397
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:01,150
And we're going to come back to that
because that view of the gyrations of the

398
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:05,230
market being caused by too much borrowing
and speculation is exactly the view

399
00:23:05,231 --> 00:23:10,150
that I'm going to take and explaining
the most recent crisis. So how does,

400
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,330
so anyway, you remember what
we did in our experiment,

401
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:18,570
we had eight buyers whose
prices reservation prices
are those eight numbers up

402
00:23:19,661 --> 00:23:22,300
there. That's what each person
thought it was worth to him.

403
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,330
Each person knew his own price,
but not any of the others.

404
00:23:25,331 --> 00:23:29,690
I told you almost nothing about what
was going on. There was some context.

405
00:23:29,691 --> 00:23:33,280
So they gave an example of a
person who thought it was worth 15.

406
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:37,510
So you had some idea probably from that
example that the numbers weren't 10,000

407
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,550
we plus you knew your own number.

408
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,440
But other than that you
knew absolutely nothing.

409
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:44,800
And each buyer knew her own number
and not any of the other numbers.

410
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,600
So here we have 16 different
pieces of information.

411
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:51,830
Everybody has an incentive to
keep her information secret.

412
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,970
Why should anybody admit
that she's willing to sell
at six that's only going to,

413
00:23:55,971 --> 00:23:57,620
you know,
she'll get a worse price.

414
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,110
She's going to lie and say
the thing is much more.

415
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,890
She's going to make an argument that
says, well, these are football. Okay,

416
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:06,800
but to try the, the guy here,
the 44 guy, he's going to say,

417
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,640
this is a football ticket.
This is, you know, it, uh,
no, sorry, what am I going to,

418
00:24:11,641 --> 00:24:15,920
let's say she's a, let's say she's a
44 she's going to say football tickets.

419
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:19,130
They're completely worthless to doing a
stereotype, either completely worthless.

420
00:24:19,131 --> 00:24:20,440
Who would want to go to a football game?

421
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:23,080
I certainly don't want to go to a football
game. They can't be worth, you know,

422
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,150
any more than 12 or something.
So all the buyers,

423
00:24:26,151 --> 00:24:29,780
the blue buyers are going to be making
arguments suggesting the price should be

424
00:24:29,781 --> 00:24:32,480
low reasons why this stuff
really isn't worth very much.

425
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,290
All the sellers are going
to making arguments saying
this stuff is intrinsically

426
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:39,110
incredibly valuable.
Football tickets are incredibly important.

427
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,320
So that's the facts.

428
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:45,110
Now you need a model and a
theory that fits the facts.

429
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:49,310
And I'm belaboring the obvious, but the
obvious is always central to everything.

430
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:53,600
The obvious theory would go
something like, well, you know,

431
00:24:53,601 --> 00:24:58,220
somehow these people are going to get
matched up and maybe 38 will sell to 44

432
00:24:58,221 --> 00:25:02,420
and all eight things will be sold. And the
more transactions you have, the better.

433
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:06,770
And you know, what else might a theory say
a wrong theory? It might say, you know,

434
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,030
the more people in red are,

435
00:25:08,031 --> 00:25:11,060
the more people making arguments
that the price should be higher,

436
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,920
the more compelling the argument will be.

437
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:16,250
You'll be overwhelmed by numbers and
you'll think that the price should be

438
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:19,610
higher because more people would be
arguing for a higher price. Okay.

439
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:23,060
But the theory, the economic theory,
the exact opposite of all that.

440
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,500
So the economic theory is,
uh, quite a shocking theory.

441
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,860
I think it starts with a situation where
people are arguing and talking about

442
00:25:33,171 --> 00:25:34,970
the price.
They're not doing anything else,

443
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:38,570
but making arguments about the price
and making offers about the price.

444
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:40,100
They're haggling about the price.

445
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:45,250
The whole of the activity is about the
price and how to change it and what it

446
00:25:45,621 --> 00:25:48,260
should be. The economic
theory, the first theory,

447
00:25:48,261 --> 00:25:53,120
most important theory of economics,
supply and demand is that, um,

448
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:58,910
so that describes what happened is the
exact opposite. You can, the theory says,

449
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,990
let's suppose that a price
appeared out of thin air.

450
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,090
There was no arguing about the price.

451
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,630
Nobody even thinks they have any
chance of changing the price.

452
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:13,780
Somehow a price gets into everybody's
head the price of 25 and at that price of

453
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:18,290
25, everybody wants to buy,
buys as much as they want.

454
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:19,700
So Mr 44,

455
00:26:19,701 --> 00:26:23,780
he thinks that the thing that ticket
is worth 44 he can buy it for 25.

456
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:28,820
He'll want to buy 40 he thinks it's worth
40 and the price is only 25. So again,

457
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:32,210
he's going to gain by buying,
he'll want to buy 12 things.

458
00:26:32,211 --> 00:26:36,980
It's only worth 12 he's not going to pay
25 for it. And similarly the sellers,

459
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:40,170
seller number 10, she's going to
say, okay, I can get 25 for it.

460
00:26:40,171 --> 00:26:43,500
I only think it's worth, it was worth
10 and it's a good deal for me to do.

461
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:48,000
So the theory says somehow miraculously
the price comes out of thin air.

462
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:52,230
It's given everybody taking that prices
given figuring they have no power to

463
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:57,000
change. It buys or sells all they
want, all they want at that price.

464
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:01,890
And so that's the theory.
So it's price taking out of thin air.

465
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:03,270
The price comes from somewhere.

466
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:08,040
Everybody Acts Nat by maximizing
doing the best for them, giving them,

467
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,060
given the price.

468
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:14,390
They all understand what the price is
and the price has miraculously been,

469
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:19,370
uh, imagined at exactly the level
that will clear all the markets.

470
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:22,470
So everyone wants to buy,
he's able to, and everyone
wants to sell. It was able to,

471
00:27:22,471 --> 00:27:23,310
that's the theory.

472
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,630
The theory is completely the opposite
of what common sense suggests. Since,

473
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,291
as I said,

474
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:33,060
the whole thing was this grappling and
groping and pushing and shoving and

475
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:35,820
yelling and arguing about what the
price should be. And the theory says,

476
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,200
nobody says a word about the price,

477
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:40,140
they just take it as given
and then they act after that.

478
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:45,410
So this is the most basic economic
model is a paradox and good economics is

479
00:27:46,921 --> 00:27:50,280
almost always a paradox. If you want
to make a convincing economic argument,

480
00:27:50,281 --> 00:27:54,240
you almost always say it in a
paradoxical way. And so the,

481
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:57,780
going back to the very beginning
where we said what a model is,

482
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:01,440
the standard economic model is
you take the exogenous things,

483
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:06,390
which in this case or the reservation
prices of all the people you have to solve

484
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,910
equations which are here,
supply equals demand,

485
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,920
which determines the endogenous variables,

486
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:13,620
which are the price and
who buys and who sells.

487
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:18,480
And the reason that the theory is always
a often paradoxical is if you change

488
00:28:18,481 --> 00:28:22,720
some exogenous variable, it looks like
it's going to move things in a, you know,

489
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,850
common sensical direction. But then when
people react to the change environment,

490
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,690
x is,

491
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:32,850
is a reaction to the change in e and
the change in x might be so big and so

492
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:37,290
important that a reverse is the apparent
change in eat. So you get these, uh,

493
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,280
surprising conclusions. If everybody
tries to save more. Cain said,

494
00:28:41,281 --> 00:28:45,780
it may be that everyone will end up
saving less. Um, things like that.

495
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:49,180
Okay. So, so economics at its
best takes advantage of this,

496
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:54,030
of it's paradoxical nature at its heart
and uses that as a rhetorical device,

497
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,590
but it's a, so it's a non obvious theory.
Now why do we believe the theory? Well,

498
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:02,520
all those different examples I
gave you of markets, um, you know,

499
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:05,280
they all seem to fit where,
I forgot where they were the,

500
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:08,790
and we remember what they were. They were
the, I don't remember what they were,

501
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:11,950
but, um, you know, the seller, the,

502
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:16,640
the shopping center thing, the
haggling, the, the, the title mom,

503
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:19,620
Borst, the commodities,
futures, all that. You know,

504
00:29:19,621 --> 00:29:23,310
if you look after the fact
that what people wanted to
do and what price emerged,

505
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:24,540
it seems to fit the theory.

506
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:27,420
So there's overwhelming evidence
that this theory seems to work.

507
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:32,570
And you saw that in our own example in
our experiment where you had no training

508
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:37,260
at all. Um, it came pretty
close. All those five, uh,

509
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:41,290
so all these five red sellers,
they all sold I think,

510
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:45,760
and the five buyers. The only difference
was that instead of 26 buying 20 baht,

511
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,860
okay. And the prices were all between
20 and 25. So they weren't exactly 25,

512
00:29:50,861 --> 00:29:52,600
but they were very close to 25.

513
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,900
And the 10 people who were
supposed to impart and sold,

514
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,420
well nine out of 10
actually did buy and sell.

515
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,160
So it's pretty hard to match a theory
like that with so little, um, practice.

516
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:07,660
I mean it's, it's uh, you know, I've
always found it quite astonishing. Um,

517
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:13,450
okay, so any I, is this happening?

518
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:19,470
Okay. Does anyone wanna make a comment
or ask a question about this? Uh,

519
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,103
theory?

520
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,780
All right, well, what are the properties
of equilibrium you get out of this? Well,

521
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:30,650
everyone trades at one price, so this is
going to be very important for finance.

522
00:30:30,651 --> 00:30:34,130
The idea that there's one price
for everything. Okay? Then

523
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:38,480
you can also define the,
um,

524
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,420
okay,
so you know what the theory is.

525
00:30:43,421 --> 00:30:46,390
I already told you the exogenous
variables or the reservation prices,

526
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:49,780
the endogenous variables is the,
the reservation values.

527
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:53,380
The endogenous variable is the price
that emerges and who buys and who sells.

528
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:57,910
So why is this such a good outcome?
Okay, it seems like a terrible outcome.

529
00:30:57,911 --> 00:31:02,050
There are those six people standing there
at the end unable to trade facing the

530
00:31:02,051 --> 00:31:03,400
camera.
You know,

531
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:07,390
looking slightly embarrassed that all
their friends managed to buy and sell and

532
00:31:07,391 --> 00:31:10,270
they couldn't do it. And what's the
matter with them? So they feel bad.

533
00:31:10,271 --> 00:31:14,200
They feel discriminated against. It
doesn't look like it's such a great thing.

534
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,550
We know that there's another way of
making all eight buyers purchase from all

535
00:31:18,551 --> 00:31:21,640
eight sellers just by, you know,
doing the corresponding one above.

536
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:25,240
What's so good about the market outcome?
It actually doesn't sound so great. Well,

537
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:27,460
the answer is it is great.

538
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:32,500
And what's great about it is that within
two minutes the market figured out

539
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,750
enough about what everybody valued the,

540
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,130
the football tickets at to
put the football tickets in
the 10 peoples' hands who

541
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:43,960
valued the most. Okay. So, uh, all right.

542
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:48,880
So in the end,
those five blue guys and those,

543
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:49,871
you know,

544
00:31:49,871 --> 00:31:54,871
almost without that one exception
and these five a and the a one,

545
00:31:54,911 --> 00:31:59,670
two, three read, uh, sellers, you know,

546
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,110
those three sellers and those five buyers,

547
00:32:02,111 --> 00:32:06,100
the top eight people ended up with the
eight football tickets and the bottom

548
00:32:06,101 --> 00:32:07,750
eight didn't end up with
any football tickets.

549
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:10,900
So the football tickets got put into the
hands of the people who value them the

550
00:32:10,901 --> 00:32:12,970
most.
And so as I said,

551
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:16,990
if you just simply sat there and went
through 16 tickets and sorted them into

552
00:32:16,991 --> 00:32:20,230
most and least, and then you don't try
to arrange all the football tickets,

553
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,450
it would have taken almost as long.

554
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:26,500
And that would have been with benefit
of knowing what all the numbers are here

555
00:32:26,501 --> 00:32:29,620
in the market,
does it not knowing what the numbers are.

556
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:33,730
And the only access to information is
through people who don't want to reveal

557
00:32:33,731 --> 00:32:36,640
their numbers and still the
market figured it out. All right.

558
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:40,010
So that's the message. That's
the, so the mod. So now,

559
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,400
okay, so, so we have a model which
is surprising, which seems to since,

560
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,720
which seems to, uh, uh,

561
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:52,750
describe the facts and which gives us a
surprising conclusion and an incredibly

562
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:54,020
important conclusion.

563
00:32:54,021 --> 00:32:59,021
The market is an extremely
useful mechanism of eliciting
information and turning

564
00:33:00,051 --> 00:33:04,490
the information into something
that allocates things
efficiently. And you know,

565
00:33:04,491 --> 00:33:06,560
you couldn't do better than
that. You couldn't, no other,

566
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,520
no other arrangement would have, uh, uh,

567
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:14,450
put football tickets in the hands
of people who like them better. So,

568
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:19,130
uh, Hayak described the market as
a great calculating machine and,

569
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:22,880
um, well, uh, so it is,

570
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:26,900
now there are a couple of other things
that you can get out of this model.

571
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:32,080
Another lesson of this model is
that the equilibrium price is equal

572
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:40,350
not to the
average of the price of the buyers.

573
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,430
The average of the price of the sellers
are the average of all the prices or

574
00:33:43,431 --> 00:33:44,264
something like that.

575
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:48,680
It's equal to what the marginal
buyer thinks it's worth.

576
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,960
So there's a critical marginal
buyer and marginal seller there.

577
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,590
They're almost indifferent to
buying or selling. You know,

578
00:33:54,591 --> 00:33:56,960
they could go either way,
they're pretty close to buying or selling.

579
00:33:56,961 --> 00:34:01,820
The price is going to turn out to be
very close to that valuation of the

580
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:05,550
marginal buyer.
Okay.

581
00:34:05,551 --> 00:34:08,790
So somehow the margin is going to play
a bit. That's of the word marginal.

582
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:13,530
This is a invention in 1871 it's going
to play a big role in economic reasoning.

583
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:18,360
Okay. And then so, so it gives us a
completely different understanding.

584
00:34:18,361 --> 00:34:21,660
You might think that the price of tickets
has something to do with their total

585
00:34:21,661 --> 00:34:24,150
value or average value
or something like that.

586
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,800
It's got to do with the
value of a marginal person,
the person just on the edge.

587
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:31,950
So the comparative statics
are that the uh, as I said,

588
00:34:31,951 --> 00:34:36,480
the surprising thing that if you change
a non marginal person, you take Mr 44,

589
00:34:36,481 --> 00:34:37,410
the buyer at the top,

590
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:41,610
he changed them to 50 looks like the
buyers and now more desperate to buy won't

591
00:34:41,611 --> 00:34:45,420
have any effect on the price.
You change that seller ms six,

592
00:34:45,421 --> 00:34:47,880
you change her to two or to eight.
Again,

593
00:34:47,881 --> 00:34:50,370
it'll have no effect on the
price because those two people,

594
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:55,430
the guy in 44 and the, and
the lady at six, they're, um,

595
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,490
they're not marginal. So they don't affect
the price. You add some more buyers,

596
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,760
you might think that they're arguing
for the price to be lower. As I said,

597
00:35:02,761 --> 00:35:05,580
you're going to end up raising the
price or else having no effect on it if

598
00:35:05,581 --> 00:35:09,300
they're not marginal. Okay. So, um,

599
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:14,460
now one more thing. One last thing,
one last message to this model.

600
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:19,290
If you didn't know we knew the reservation
prices ourselves because I set up the

601
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:22,860
experiment, but if you didn't know
it, you might want to infer something.

602
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,660
You could infer something from the price.

603
00:35:24,661 --> 00:35:27,960
So part of finance is going in a
backwards direction. The theory says,

604
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:31,980
take the exogenous variables, predict
what the equilibrium is going to be.

605
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,640
Financial theory does that, but often
it goes in the reverse direction.

606
00:35:35,641 --> 00:35:37,980
We can see what the prices,
that must tell

607
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,120
us something about the
exogenous valuations.

608
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,710
So a financial theory says, well, if the
price is such and such, it must mean that,

609
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:49,530
uh, the, at least the marginal
person valleys is at such and such.

610
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:54,240
And so that's why the price is that it's
the value of some, uh, special person.

611
00:35:54,241 --> 00:35:58,320
So we'll come back to that
argument. Okay. So that, that's uh,

612
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:03,900
so that lesson of economics,
that's the first economic model,

613
00:36:03,901 --> 00:36:07,500
the most important economic model we're
going to now have to generalize it and

614
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:11,040
in all kinds of ways, but it's always
going to come back to that same message.

615
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:15,180
And so Adam Smith, you know, he was the
one who first invented the invisible hand.

616
00:36:15,181 --> 00:36:17,190
There was nothing
mathematical and what he said,

617
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:22,110
Ricardo was the first one to make a
model. Um, Mark said quite, you know,

618
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:23,370
I don't have time to talk about Marx,

619
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:27,030
but he had quite elaborate models
actually in his, in his, uh,

620
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:32,240
his verbal arguments conceal
a huge mathematical apparatus,

621
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,810
a on his death bed, by the way. He was
trying to learn calculus. Incidentally.

622
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:41,790
I'm so Jeavons mangere involve Ross 1871,
right after Mark's is famous,

623
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,160
you know,
capital came out in 1967.

624
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,100
They invented the idea of the margin and
things like that and the critique of uh,

625
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:53,020
therefore of Marx and Marx was trying to
figure out what they were all about. Um,

626
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:57,750
anyway, Marshall was a great economist,
Fisher, Samson, Hicks, Arrow, Debreu.

627
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,590
These are the people who most famous
people who extended this model and the

628
00:37:01,591 --> 00:37:05,880
logic of laissez faire and regulation,
which we're going to uh, come to.

629
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,900
Now, what are the two ways we have
to generalize there three ways.

630
00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:14,730
We have to generalize the model. We
have to think of many, uh, commodities,

631
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:15,720
not just one.

632
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:20,220
We have to think of people buying more
than one unit of a commodity. Okay?

633
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:24,210
That's called general equilibrium. And
then we have to put in financial things.

634
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:28,470
We have to put in stocks and
bonds and things like that.
It sounds like, you know,

635
00:37:28,471 --> 00:37:30,390
things are going to get so complicated,

636
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:35,190
but in fact it turns out I'm going to
spend another class after this talking

637
00:37:35,191 --> 00:37:38,700
about this. There's not that much
complication to get all those things in.

638
00:37:38,701 --> 00:37:40,530
There'll be two more classes about this.

639
00:37:40,531 --> 00:37:44,240
So I'm recapitulating all that you have
to know for the purposes of this class

640
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,890
about from introductory economics
and intermediate economics.

641
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:48,420
The only thing you have to know,
uh,

642
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:51,390
you'll hear now in these two classes
and some of you will find it's

643
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,160
incomprehensible.

644
00:37:53,161 --> 00:37:56,730
And so that's why one good reason for
doing it now you find out right at the

645
00:37:56,731 --> 00:38:00,880
beginning whether it's too complicated
to bother with. So anyway, I'm going to,

646
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:05,400
uh,
keep going now to extend the model.

647
00:38:05,401 --> 00:38:09,930
So the biggest advance,
the next advance sort of,

648
00:38:09,931 --> 00:38:12,990
which was related to
this is Adam Smith said,

649
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:18,770
how could it be that a water which is
so valuable has such a low price and

650
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:20,071
diamonds,

651
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:24,840
which are so useless basically to
everybody has such a high price. I mean,

652
00:38:24,841 --> 00:38:29,841
there's not some marginal buyer who
thinks that diamonds are somehow more

653
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:31,740
important to him than water.

654
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:34,830
So how could it be that water's got
a much lower price than diamonds?

655
00:38:34,831 --> 00:38:36,280
And everybody would say

656
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,480
that it's more valuable?
Well to answer that question,

657
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:44,560
what we have to do is we
have to imagine that there's,

658
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:50,930
that people are capable of consuming
more than one good. So for instance,

659
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,290
let's imagine that there's good acts here,

660
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:56,540
which is the football
tickets we had before.

661
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,540
And you remember that.

662
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,370
You remember our numbers? Let's just
go back to the numbers for a second.

663
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:10,330
I'll stay here for awhile. The first
buyer thought one ticket was worth 44.

664
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:14,290
A second ticket was useless to
that buyer. Well, suppose we right?

665
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,860
Oh,
suppose we write utility here.

666
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:31,540
Okay. Now this first buyer,
let's put this a 44 here.

667
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,010
This first buyer,

668
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,540
you might say got utility of
44 for holding one ticket.

669
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:41,650
If the old half a ticket, maybe as
utility would be 22. Now, in fact,

670
00:39:41,651 --> 00:39:43,960
we know that half a ticket
doesn't get you into a game.

671
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:46,600
So as utility would really be zero.
But you know,

672
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:50,920
the the half when we're talking about
thousands of tickets to a football game,

673
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:55,570
a half or one, it's not so important.
Let's just say that his, his utility,

674
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,060
uh,
when up linearly with the,

675
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,570
with the quantity of tickets he
had to make a discrete variable,

676
00:40:01,571 --> 00:40:06,430
a continuous variable is utility, goes
up linear at the rate of 44 per ticket.

677
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,740
Well, after 44, after one ticket,

678
00:40:08,741 --> 00:40:11,440
he gets no extra utility out
of holding any more tickets.

679
00:40:11,441 --> 00:40:15,400
So as utility might look
something like that. Okay.

680
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:19,570
But now let's imagine he wanted two
tickets and that the first ticket was

681
00:40:19,571 --> 00:40:24,520
important to him. And the second ticket
he could take his girlfriend, let's say,

682
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:26,350
but she didn't, it doesn't want, you know,

683
00:40:26,351 --> 00:40:30,400
he's not quite as worried
about her and some self.

684
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,530
So let's say that he,
uh,

685
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:36,930
for the second ticket gets
an extra 40 new tiles.

686
00:40:36,931 --> 00:40:41,200
So after you get to ticket number two
is utility is going to be up to 84,

687
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:43,630
which is 44 and 40.

688
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:48,870
Now you notice that the rate of increase
of utility per unit of ticket is 44

689
00:40:49,991 --> 00:40:54,430
here and then it switches to
40. Okay. Now why do I, um,

690
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,400
why do I, uh, okay. And you,

691
00:41:02,401 --> 00:41:04,500
if he wanted one more ticket,
maybe you could go up.

692
00:41:04,501 --> 00:41:07,740
Maybe you'd only get utility
one 20 for the last ticket.

693
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:16,850
Raizel for third ticket is utility
would say three it goes up like that.

694
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:20,250
Usually it would go up like this.
It's just a little flatter again.

695
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:26,271
Okay,

696
00:41:26,271 --> 00:41:30,950
so here we have a utility function which
is increasing the number of tickets you

697
00:41:30,951 --> 00:41:33,020
hold.
It's not restricted just having one,

698
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:37,550
but the rate of increase goes down as
you get more and more tickets from the

699
00:41:37,551 --> 00:41:41,060
rate of increase of 44 to the rate of
increase of 40 until the rate of increase

700
00:41:41,061 --> 00:41:45,980
of 36 now if you ask this person how
many tickets does he want to buy, well,

701
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:49,310
what's he going to say? How's he
going to figure out how much to buy?

702
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,890
Well suppose, okay, so this is utility,

703
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:57,110
but now I clean this person with buying
multiple tickets is going to behave

704
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,310
exactly like the top three people
up there would have behaved.

705
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:02,421
Okay,

706
00:42:02,421 --> 00:42:07,421
so his utility at the top for three
tickets is one 20 for two is 84 for one is

707
00:42:07,761 --> 00:42:10,820
44 those sound like important
numbers is totally utility,

708
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,770
but actually they're
not important numbers.

709
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,860
The important number is the margin
of utility. So the margin utility.

710
00:42:16,861 --> 00:42:19,310
So if we go one,
two and three here,

711
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:23,820
the margin utility for
the first ticket was 44

712
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:28,100
the margin utility for
the second ticket was 40

713
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,960
and the margin until it for the third
ticket was 36 so those are the important

714
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:38,540
numbers. The same numbers of that
are up there. Why is that? Well,

715
00:42:38,541 --> 00:42:43,490
let's ask the guy. Okay, this person
who now likes three tickets after here,

716
00:42:43,491 --> 00:42:47,330
let's say he's flat, so it goes
down to zero. Let's ask him,

717
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:51,860
how many tickets would he
buy at the price of 42 well,

718
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:57,050
from this utility function,
it's, you know, you have to
say, if I bought one ticket,

719
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:00,620
I have a utility of 44 minus,

720
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:05,680
let's say my utility function now is you
have x and money is this function of X.

721
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,980
I'll call this, you have X. I don't
want to write it out. This is,

722
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:13,760
you have x plus m for money.

723
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:18,200
So he says if I buy one ticket at
a price of 44 I lose 42 from here,

724
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:22,220
but I gained 44 from here so I'll
probably should buy one ticket.

725
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:24,080
If I buy a second ticket,
I go up,

726
00:43:24,081 --> 00:43:28,430
this number goes up to 84 and now
this one goes down by 42 twice.

727
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,420
So maybe it's not such a great idea.
So what does he actually thinking?

728
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:36,350
All he's doing is he's looking at the
price and this access and comparing it to

729
00:43:36,351 --> 00:43:40,460
is marginally utility. The extra
utility out of getting an extra ticket.

730
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,530
So if the price is 42 here,

731
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:45,950
he's going to say well at a price
of 42 the first one's worthwhile.

732
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:48,320
I'm getting more utility out of that.
After that,

733
00:43:48,321 --> 00:43:51,950
it's stupid to buy another ticket cause
I'm getting extra utility of 40 compared

734
00:43:51,951 --> 00:43:56,951
to a price of 42 so he's going to do
exactly the same thing as our single buyer

735
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,850
or a single ticket buyers did over there.

736
00:44:01,851 --> 00:44:06,851
One guy whose utility goes from 44 to
84 to one 20 is going to behave exactly

737
00:44:08,211 --> 00:44:12,530
provided he's got enough money to
afford to buy at these going prices.

738
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:13,423
He's going to be,

739
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:17,420
his behavior will be exactly the same
as the three separate individuals over

740
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:21,710
there. So in fact, the
marginal revolution,

741
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:25,490
so Jeavons,
mangere

742
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:32,510
and Vol Ross in 1871 all came up with the
idea at the same time with diminishing

743
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:35,610
marginal utility.

744
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:41,200
Hey Man,

745
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,950
he said if you have people who
consume multiple amounts of very uh,

746
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,080
commodity,
but they have diminishing margin utility,

747
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:52,770
there are going to behave very much
the same way as this little example.

748
00:44:52,771 --> 00:44:57,300
So this little example, in fact, it's
going to be extremely, uh, instructive.

749
00:44:57,301 --> 00:44:59,490
In fact,
it contains all the kernels of truth.

750
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:04,560
I'm a more general model where people
consume huge amounts of every god. Okay?

751
00:45:04,561 --> 00:45:06,720
Just that they have
diminishing margin utility.

752
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:13,460
So I'm going to now describe
a slightly more complicated,

753
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,120
so I'm going to describe
this more complicated model.

754
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:21,420
So what's the,

755
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:26,430
what's the way of building a much more
general but hopefully still very simple

756
00:45:26,431 --> 00:45:27,660
abstract model?

757
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:33,080
All of general equilibrium that will
capture and generalize the example we

758
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:35,130
already had.
Well,

759
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,750
the idea is to start with
the exogenous variables.

760
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,860
This isn't gonna moves. I
don't want to do that. Do this.

761
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:47,930
Yeah,

762
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:49,480
you exogenous variables.

763
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,413
Okay.

764
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:56,560
Are going to be the youth,
the people.

765
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:02,320
Okay. So I'll have individuals, I and
I, so let's call them individuals.

766
00:46:02,321 --> 00:46:05,140
So you've seen why I use the word I,

767
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,750
I and I. Okay. And,

768
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:18,110
and what is it that characterizes
every individual a utility function?

769
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,220
So each is characterized by utility

770
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:25,330
and an endowment.

771
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:33,060
Okay. So to start with, let's
say then, so the individuals,

772
00:46:33,061 --> 00:46:34,950
and we'll call the
individuals and the Gordon's

773
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:41,660
C and c. So let's just say
there are two goods, x and y

774
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:48,560
Hay. So an individual is going to be
characterized by utility function, uh,

775
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:49,131
say,
uh,

776
00:46:49,131 --> 00:46:53,750
welfare function of x and y equals you.

777
00:46:53,751 --> 00:46:57,980
I have ax plus V,
I have y.

778
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:03,360
Okay.
And an endowment,

779
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,720
e equals e,

780
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:09,630
x of y.

781
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:16,800
So for example, you could have,
I don't know, you could have,

782
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:18,600
uh,
this could be,

783
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:21,900
so let's just think about this.

784
00:47:21,901 --> 00:47:25,140
So this is exactly the kind
of situation we had before.

785
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:28,710
We had precisely this going on before.
What was the endowment?

786
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:33,160
Every person began with money.
This could have been money before.

787
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:34,700
Okay.

788
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,020
And with football tickets.

789
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,473
Yeah.

790
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,660
And we said that the story that,

791
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:50,440
so these original marginalist argued
that it's part of human nature that the

792
00:47:50,931 --> 00:47:55,250
more you get of something, the less and
less extra advantage that brings you.

793
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:57,230
And that's just, you know,
there may be exceptions.

794
00:47:57,231 --> 00:48:01,460
Maybe you need to have something in order
to, you know, you need both shoes, uh,

795
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:04,100
in order to the shoes to
help. But then, you know,

796
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:07,670
every pair of shoes after that was going
to be less and less valuable to you.

797
00:48:07,671 --> 00:48:11,010
And so beside from these
small, you know, uh,

798
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:14,750
blips that come from indivisibility is,
or things like that,

799
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:17,540
people's utility increases,

800
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:20,270
but at smaller and smaller rate
as they get more of everything,

801
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,440
that's just human nature.

802
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:24,480
They claim they even tried to
measure human nature and they, yeah.

803
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:25,990
And to measure utilities.

804
00:48:25,991 --> 00:48:29,360
So they would try and measure
the temperature of the
skin and things like that

805
00:48:29,361 --> 00:48:32,480
and see how it increased when you gave
people more of something and whether the

806
00:48:32,481 --> 00:48:36,770
rate of increase, you know,
and how much they, you know,
smiled and stuff like that.

807
00:48:36,771 --> 00:48:39,240
Whether that would actually change
in a lesser and lesser ways.

808
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:40,630
You add more and more utility where they,

809
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,420
they abandoned that sort of thing
eventually. But anyway, there I,

810
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,680
they kept the idea of
diminishing margin utility.

811
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:50,690
So we want to keep the idea that Ui
of acts and vi of why show diminishing

812
00:48:50,691 --> 00:48:51,770
marginal utility.

813
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:54,730
Yeah.

814
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:57,610
So the way of saying that,
and I told you this is one of the,

815
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:02,410
so the first handout and the reading
list was a review of mathematics.

816
00:49:02,411 --> 00:49:05,290
You should know. So diminishing
or, or if you don't know,

817
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:07,030
you have to learn diminishing margin.

818
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:10,210
Utility means something that looks
like that. It's a concave function.

819
00:49:10,211 --> 00:49:13,900
So here's x,
here's utility and hears you.

820
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:17,020
I evac say it goes up
as you get more acts,

821
00:49:17,021 --> 00:49:21,430
but at a rate that declines. So the
slope is getting smaller and smaller.

822
00:49:21,431 --> 00:49:25,570
That's diminishing marginal utility.
So this curve that's increasing,

823
00:49:25,571 --> 00:49:26,860
but at a lesser and lesser rate,

824
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,760
we can approximate with a continuous
differentiable curve that looks like that.

825
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:33,460
So it doesn't have the kinks here and a,

826
00:49:33,461 --> 00:49:36,100
and that's exactly the kind
of assumption that you know,

827
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:39,460
seems reasonable to fit the facts
and at least for consumption.

828
00:49:39,461 --> 00:49:42,960
Our main interest of course is at the
bottom here and financial equity room.

829
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:45,490
But we have to know what's going
on in the economy. You know,

830
00:49:45,491 --> 00:49:49,570
all these finance professors,
as I said in business schools,

831
00:49:49,571 --> 00:49:51,520
they ignored the part of the above.

832
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:55,270
They started right away with the assets
and the bonds said they didn't need to

833
00:49:55,271 --> 00:49:58,180
pay any attention to what was
going on in the economy. Okay.

834
00:49:58,181 --> 00:50:00,760
Because everything was going to be great.
And uh,

835
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:03,520
but we're going to find that there's a
big interaction between the financial

836
00:50:03,521 --> 00:50:06,400
sector in the economic sector. That's
going to be the heart of what we're doing,

837
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,930
even though it was ignored and
finance most of the time. So anyway,

838
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:14,080
diminishing marginal utility,
um, for both of these.

839
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,031
So,
for instance,

840
00:50:16,031 --> 00:50:21,031
we could have a hundred miles a hundred
x minus one half x squared plus y.

841
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:27,130
That's one example of utility function.

842
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:35,870
Okay? So that's going to be a
standard kind of utility function.

843
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:40,370
So the only two ones I'm ever going to
use or things like this are one third log

844
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:43,010
x plus two thirds blog.

845
00:50:43,011 --> 00:50:47,810
Why whenever I write log,
I mean natural log.

846
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,820
Okay? Now how? So here's,
this is linear quadratic.

847
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:58,190
So listens quadratic,

848
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:05,620
in fact linear, quadratic. So maybe
both will be quadratic and this is uh,

849
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,370
this is logarithmic.

850
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:11,920
Now both of these have this property of,

851
00:51:11,921 --> 00:51:15,890
of diminishing margin utility cause
I can take the derivative of this,

852
00:51:15,891 --> 00:51:20,510
the derivative of 100 x
minus one half x squared.

853
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:25,511
So the marginal utility of x is equal
to 100 minus x and that obviously

854
00:51:28,911 --> 00:51:32,180
declines.
So that's diminishing marginal utility.

855
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:37,460
And then the derivative here,
the margin utility with respect to act,

856
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:42,740
it depends on x again,
is going to be one third times one over x

857
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:47,630
is the derivative of the law, I guess
one of racks and this x gets bigger.

858
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:49,010
That also declines.

859
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:52,640
So these are the two functions that
we're going to use over and over again

860
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:55,190
because I want to make things
concrete with actual numbers.

861
00:51:55,191 --> 00:51:58,310
So we'll always solve
examples with quadratic stuff.

862
00:51:58,311 --> 00:52:02,130
Maybe everything will be quadratic or
linear. And with logarithmic stuff,

863
00:52:02,131 --> 00:52:05,600
it was the only two functions you really
have to be totally comfortable with.

864
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:08,960
So you have to understand
what a derivative is. This
was a partial derivative.

865
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,740
So how much extra utility do
you get out of consuming more x?

866
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:15,710
If you've already got a certain
amount of x and your possession,

867
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,570
it's a hundred minus x.

868
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:21,170
How much more utility do you get out
of consuming more acts if this is your

869
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:25,880
utility? Um, when your consumption's
already a certain amount of x,

870
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:28,550
it's one third times one over x.

871
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:33,380
So those are the two things you have
to be comfortable with using. Okay,

872
00:52:33,381 --> 00:52:35,990
so that, that's, that's the utility.

873
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:39,830
What else do we need to describe a person?
It's his endowment.

874
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,340
So with only two goods,

875
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:49,540
here's acts and here's why.
So we could have an endowment,

876
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:54,040
e I, x, e, I.

877
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:57,340
Y that's the endowment of x.

878
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:02,470
And y if a certain person,
all right, x, e, I. Why?

879
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,620
Okay, so this person, let's
say it's this top guy,

880
00:53:08,621 --> 00:53:12,640
a hundred x minus one x squared plus y.
He has a certain utility function.

881
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:13,990
He's got a certain endowment.

882
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:18,950
Maybe there's somebody else over here
who I can put in a different color hall.

883
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:23,320
I think pink is a good color.

884
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:29,310
So another person might be
over here and this is e j a y

885
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,583
and

886
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:33,520
e.

887
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:38,520
J.

888
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:42,420
X. Okay, so Jay has a lot more of
why, and I have a lot more vex.

889
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:45,160
They're two different people,
but you could imagine not two people.

890
00:53:45,161 --> 00:53:48,610
You could imagine 150 of you with
different endowments in different utility

891
00:53:48,611 --> 00:53:52,000
functions are 300 million of you with
difference endowments and different

892
00:53:52,001 --> 00:53:56,880
utility functions. And what general
like liberty was about is saying, well,

893
00:53:56,881 --> 00:54:00,250
you've got all these people with
well-defined utility functions.

894
00:54:00,251 --> 00:54:03,130
Those are the data. We may not know
them, but they know them themselves.

895
00:54:03,131 --> 00:54:06,700
With all those utility functions and all
those endowments and throw 300 million

896
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:10,510
of them together,
or 150 of you together,

897
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:13,090
can you predict what's going to happen?

898
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:16,450
And is the thing that happens
good for the society? Okay?

899
00:54:16,451 --> 00:54:21,310
So that's the problem with general
equilibrium. And it turns out that,

900
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:24,820
um,
with these simple utility functions,

901
00:54:24,821 --> 00:54:27,520
it's very easy to solve frack
liver and predict what'll happen.

902
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:31,690
And things look great until you get
the financial equilibrium. Okay?

903
00:54:31,691 --> 00:54:35,140
And we'll be able to solve them
either by hand or on a computer.

904
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:38,500
And we're going to take advantage of
that because we want concrete answers to

905
00:54:38,501 --> 00:54:42,190
concrete problems and we want to interact
it with the financial world to see how

906
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:47,490
you know, to see what happens. So now,

907
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:52,180
so remember, what's the next step? The
first step is exogenous variables. Okay?

908
00:54:52,181 --> 00:54:56,380
So we define the exogenous variables.
The next step is the endogenous variable.

909
00:54:56,381 --> 00:54:58,810
So what are the endogenous
variable is going to be,

910
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:06,670
can the endogenous variables
are going to be the prices

911
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,210
and the trains

912
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,370
or final consumption's.

913
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:20,180
You can always deduce a trade from a
final consumption because if you know your

914
00:55:21,691 --> 00:55:24,750
endowment, that exogenous thing
and you're consuming more of x,

915
00:55:24,751 --> 00:55:28,620
then you're endowed with, he
must've bought that different
somewhere. And if you,

916
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,860
you know, if you're consuming
less, why then you started with,

917
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:34,140
you must have sold some of that.

918
00:55:34,141 --> 00:55:38,250
Why in order to end up consuming less so
the endogenous variables and the prices

919
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,084
and the trains.

920
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:44,540
Now how can we make a general theory that
for an arbitrary number of people and

921
00:55:45,901 --> 00:55:50,010
arbitrary number of goods you can solve
and figure out what's going to happen

922
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:53,340
that looks very much like the
example and has as a special case.

923
00:55:53,341 --> 00:55:56,040
The example we did with we
did to me to begin with,

924
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:00,810
that's what happened with general life
Librium and I'm about to describe it.

925
00:56:00,811 --> 00:56:04,620
So the next step is always
to write down the equilibrium

926
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:09,650
equilibrium as a bunch of
simultaneous equations.

927
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:14,241
Okay,

928
00:56:14,241 --> 00:56:17,720
so what are all the equilibrium equation
is going to be and that's what's going

929
00:56:17,721 --> 00:56:21,440
to be our model of what happens in the
world. Okay? There are any questions.

930
00:56:21,441 --> 00:56:23,800
This is how are all doing here?

931
00:56:23,801 --> 00:56:28,020
Is this was painfully repetitive of
what you know or, you know, just to get,

932
00:56:28,021 --> 00:56:31,570
I need some feedback here.
How many of you haven't seen this before?

933
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:34,360
Everybody's seen this before.

934
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,320
What about all these people who emailed
me and said they were scientists and

935
00:56:38,321 --> 00:56:43,321
philosophers and a psychologist and they
wanted to take economics the first day.

936
00:56:43,511 --> 00:56:46,240
So you're one of those people maybe
didn't email me, but you, okay.

937
00:56:46,241 --> 00:56:50,110
So this is first for you, but everybody
else, you've all seen this before. Okay,

938
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:53,950
well that's, that's good.
I can move along here.

939
00:56:53,951 --> 00:56:57,100
So I'll keep looking at you.
Um,

940
00:56:57,870 --> 00:57:01,240
I'll keep looking at you as I proceed
here. So don't feel bashful. You know,

941
00:57:01,241 --> 00:57:06,130
all these, you know, speak up if it's
not making sense. Okay. So how do you,

942
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,550
so what was the,
what was the great conceptual advance?

943
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,640
It was one conceptual
advance was the budget set.

944
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,800
Now this will turn out to be
in, in economics. They've all,

945
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:21,700
the rest of the 140 of them have
all got this down, but it's,

946
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:23,980
but as soon as we turned it
into a financial problem,

947
00:57:23,981 --> 00:57:25,420
they're not going to
be able to do it again,

948
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,190
even though it's going
to be the same idea.

949
00:57:27,191 --> 00:57:30,940
So there's a budget set was
an extremely clever idea,

950
00:57:30,941 --> 00:57:34,390
which I'll now repeat for them
and tell you for the first time.

951
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:38,380
But I can almost guarantee that of all
they all think it's obvious when we do

952
00:57:38,381 --> 00:57:39,700
the first financial problem,

953
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:42,850
they aren't gonna be able to do it
even though it's the exact same idea.

954
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:47,350
So what's the idea? You begin with
your endowment EAI acts and DIY.

955
00:57:47,351 --> 00:57:51,010
So this person has to
buy and sell x and y.

956
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:55,600
So the person says to himself, you know,
I've started with this x and y, you know,

957
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:57,550
I might like something that's better.
Now,

958
00:57:57,551 --> 00:58:02,320
how can you illustrate what's
better for this person? Well,

959
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:05,980
Edgeworth as I mentioned,
um,

960
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:13,650
Edgeworth Edgeworth invented the
idea of the indifference curve.

961
00:58:14,391 --> 00:58:15,224
So he says,

962
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:20,340
all the goods that are of the same utility
can be described by this indifference

963
00:58:20,711 --> 00:58:25,540
curve x. You know this person or
you're a, her utility is one third log,

964
00:58:25,541 --> 00:58:29,230
x plus two thirds log. Why?
Well if you, if you, um,

965
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:34,600
if you, uh, if she consumes less of
x enough extra Y, we'll put her up,

966
00:58:34,601 --> 00:58:38,080
make her just indifferent to where she
was before because there's a trade off

967
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:40,360
between acts and why economics
is all about trade offs.

968
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:44,980
So this is her indifference curve. Maybe
his indifference curve looks like that.

969
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:48,010
Different slope. Okay. Entirely different.

970
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:53,190
So he thinks a lot of why
a little diminution and why
you better get a lot of x

971
00:58:54,341 --> 00:58:58,480
to compensate him. She's kind of more
balanced and things x and y, you know,

972
00:58:58,481 --> 00:59:00,400
unless she starts to get too much of x,

973
00:59:00,401 --> 00:59:02,200
in which case why is
more important to her.

974
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:04,540
She in general is more balanced
than he is, but anyways,

975
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:07,750
they have different tastes,
different utility functions
and different endowments.

976
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:10,210
So what's going to happen in the end?
Well,

977
00:59:10,211 --> 00:59:12,370
the budget's set
describes what she can do.

978
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:15,370
We're going to assume as
we did before those fork,

979
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,010
that cornerstone of economic reasoning.

980
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:21,590
Somehow when these hundred million people,
300 million people get together,

981
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:24,500
if they're going to
miraculously discover the price,

982
00:59:24,501 --> 00:59:26,900
they're going to be screaming at each
other. But we don't care about that.

983
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,840
We just say for the
purposes of the big picture,

984
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,480
some price of x and y is going to emerge.

985
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,590
So equilibrium is going to be
a price of x and a price of y.

986
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:41,720
It's going to emerge. And now what is
this? What can she do? Well, she can say,

987
00:59:41,721 --> 00:59:46,220
she can say, okay, given
my ex I can buy more acts.

988
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:49,580
Then I started with,
and if I do that,

989
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:54,530
the price of acts as Px.
So if I want to buy more,

990
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:58,370
I'm going to ha I have this already.
If I want to end up consuming XII,

991
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:01,970
so final consumption will be XII.
And why I,

992
01:00:01,971 --> 01:00:06,140
this is the final consumption.
So my trade,

993
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:07,730
if I want to buy more,

994
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:11,900
I can express the idea that I'm buying
more by saying my final consumption is

995
01:00:11,901 --> 01:00:14,840
bigger than my endowment.
So I've had to buy,

996
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:16,850
I've had to trade to get this much more,

997
01:00:16,851 --> 01:00:20,870
which means I had to pay px
times this difference. Okay,

998
01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:23,810
now how did I get the money for that?
Well,

999
01:00:23,811 --> 01:00:27,680
I got the money for that
by selling some of y.

1000
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:31,730
So I sold why I started with Eei,
Y

1001
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:37,820
and I sold some of it because I
ended up with less than I started.

1002
01:00:37,821 --> 01:00:42,020
So the money I got by selling why
I can use to spend on buying x,

1003
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:43,730
that's the basic budget constraint.

1004
01:00:43,731 --> 01:00:47,350
Now the cleverness is in realizing
that it doesn't matter which one.

1005
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:50,990
So here excise bigger than the,
I asked, you're buying acts here,

1006
01:00:50,991 --> 01:00:53,630
why eyes less than DIY?
You're selling why?

1007
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:57,100
And so the revenue you get from
selling y equals the expenditure.

1008
01:00:57,101 --> 01:00:58,250
You make them buying x.

1009
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:01,880
So the cleverness is and realizing
it doesn't matter what the signs are,

1010
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:04,810
if Exci is less than EAI x,

1011
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:09,020
this equation still makes sense because
then you get a negative number, right?

1012
01:01:09,021 --> 01:01:11,900
You've gotten money by consuming
less acts. Then you started with,

1013
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:15,820
so that's money you can use to buy.
Why and then why?

1014
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:20,720
I will be, you'll be able to buy more live
than you started with. So this number,

1015
01:01:20,721 --> 01:01:24,110
we'll also be negative by
the same amount as this.

1016
01:01:24,111 --> 01:01:27,020
This is the extra value on why
this is the extra value on x.

1017
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:31,200
So whether the x's and the y's are bigger
or smaller than the aix is re I wise,

1018
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:35,690
this equation defines the budget
trading opportunities of the agent.

1019
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:40,610
Now how did that go too fast?
Where you got that? Okay,

1020
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:43,910
so he can write that a little
bit more simply by saying,

1021
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:48,620
putting a plus here and reversing
the order, making it more symmetric.

1022
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:53,150
So this is why I minus e y equals zero.
Okay,

1023
01:01:53,151 --> 01:01:54,320
so that's the budget set.

1024
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:00,570
[inaudible]
agent I

1025
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:05,210
and on the diagram, the budget set,
if I'm out of colors that show up,

1026
01:02:05,211 --> 01:02:10,100
I think all the others got vetoed.
I think orange was okay.

1027
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,620
Okay. The budget set, then we'll
be something that looks like this.

1028
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,210
Well,
it was terrible.

1029
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,460
How bad can we get?
Okay,

1030
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,780
so that budget set might
look something like a,

1031
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:32,600
let's make it this way.
Okay.

1032
01:02:32,601 --> 01:02:36,990
Looks something like that. It's
a linear line that goes up. Um,

1033
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:40,240
let's just forget this guy's budget set.
We'll do the other one night.

1034
01:02:40,241 --> 01:02:42,850
He can get it better in the picture.
So this one is budget set,

1035
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:46,300
his budget set might look
something like that. Okay.

1036
01:02:46,301 --> 01:02:51,230
So his budget set, nevermind hers, it
goes off the page, hurt his budget set.

1037
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:55,670
You start with us endowment. He can,
if the prices are given px and P,

1038
01:02:55,671 --> 01:03:00,671
y px and p why define a linear
tradeoff between x and Y in this case,

1039
01:03:02,151 --> 01:03:06,620
Jay, because you know the more x you
consume, the less why you have to consume.

1040
01:03:06,621 --> 01:03:07,900
And there's obvious and the amount of,

1041
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:11,750
and there's going to be a linear trade
off between the two given by rearranging

1042
01:03:11,751 --> 01:03:15,050
these terms cause they're all gonna,
you know, these x and p why are fixed.

1043
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:17,870
So those are just a linear
equation and EXCI and why.

1044
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,480
And so that trade off is
given by that budget set.

1045
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:23,720
So Mr Pink is going to try,

1046
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:28,780
given his opportunities on this budget
set to pick the combination of x and y,

1047
01:03:29,301 --> 01:03:30,350
then it's best for him.

1048
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:34,520
And so that's going to turn out
to be something that's right here.

1049
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,720
Because no other combination of x and Y,
we'll give them as much utility as that.

1050
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:44,640
Hey, did that make sense? All right.
So that's it. That's the main,

1051
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:47,220
that's the main lesson. So, uh,

1052
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:51,150
how do you describe novel whole
Echo Librium conditions? Well,

1053
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:56,240
so equilibrium now if you can see
this aqua Librium is defined bye

1054
01:03:58,860 --> 01:03:59,050
bye.

1055
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:04,050
What it's defined by Px p,

1056
01:04:04,331 --> 01:04:08,830
Y
and x and Y

1057
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,670
for all Imr.
Yeah.

1058
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:17,380
It's just the prices that emerge and
what everybody final consumption's that

1059
01:04:17,381 --> 01:04:21,730
everybody chooses of x and y. They're
only two goods here. So the price of x,

1060
01:04:21,731 --> 01:04:25,030
the price of y, what every
person I ends up with x, Y,

1061
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:29,950
and why and what has to be, what has to
be the case, what has to be the case?

1062
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:33,340
The first equation is going to be that,
um,

1063
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:39,030
the final consumptions of everybody have
to equal the final endowments because

1064
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,130
everyone who buys has to be
met by another cell. Remember,

1065
01:04:42,131 --> 01:04:46,930
equilibrium was priced taking ancient
optimization, rational expectations,

1066
01:04:46,931 --> 01:04:51,110
and market clearing. Price taking means
everybody knows what the prices are.

1067
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:53,710
Miraculously px and p why before they act.

1068
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:57,400
Age and optimization we're going to come
to it means they do the best thing they

1069
01:04:57,401 --> 01:04:58,234
can.

1070
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:02,020
Rational expectations means even though
they're only buying one good and there

1071
01:05:02,021 --> 01:05:05,920
are thousands of the economy,
they understand all the
prices and when they act,

1072
01:05:05,921 --> 01:05:07,000
they're looking in,
you know,

1073
01:05:07,001 --> 01:05:09,280
they're taking into account all
the trade offs they could make.

1074
01:05:09,281 --> 01:05:13,000
So they realize the whole vector of
prices and market clearing means for any

1075
01:05:13,001 --> 01:05:17,060
buyer, there's a seller. So market
clearing means summation from I

1076
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:22,480
avec sy has to equal summation.
I am,

1077
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:27,370
I have the endowment, Eei, I
have x. So in this picture,

1078
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:33,070
if I added this to this,
this was the endowment.

1079
01:05:33,071 --> 01:05:35,860
So add this vector to that vector.

1080
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:41,430
I get this thing over here and this
is going to be the total endowment

1081
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:46,990
in the economy.

1082
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:50,250
Okay,

1083
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:52,560
so this total endowment,
Eei x,

1084
01:05:52,561 --> 01:05:55,800
I had over every person I
what the total endowment is.

1085
01:05:55,801 --> 01:05:59,100
So add his endowment of x to
this guys and downwind of x,

1086
01:05:59,101 --> 01:06:00,510
and I get the total endowment of X.

1087
01:06:00,511 --> 01:06:04,580
I had his endowment of why to her or her
endowment of wine to his endowment of

1088
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:07,260
wine. They get the total
endowment of why? Okay,

1089
01:06:07,261 --> 01:06:12,160
so the first two equations are summation.
I and I,

1090
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:17,170
why I equal summation,
I and I of Eei. Why?

1091
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:23,170
The third equation is everybody's
going to choose on their budget.

1092
01:06:23,171 --> 01:06:26,590
Set everyone, this person, Mr Pink here,

1093
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:31,620
he's going to choose not
inside his budget, said he
can't choose outside, right?

1094
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:34,570
Because you know, spending is,
there's no point in wasting money.

1095
01:06:34,571 --> 01:06:37,850
He's going to buy the combination
of x and y that lies on his budgets,

1096
01:06:37,851 --> 01:06:39,940
that that does as well as he possibly can.

1097
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:44,370
So the equation here is going to be the P.
Um,

1098
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:50,120
I times x xy minus e I x plus p y
times y minus D I y is equal to zero.

1099
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,730
You know what?
I could do this for Jay to just,

1100
01:06:59,731 --> 01:07:02,910
since I've got a picture of this is p x,

1101
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:07,950
this is p y p x times x,
j minus e I j.

1102
01:07:07,951 --> 01:07:10,320
So I'm doing a special
case now with two people.

1103
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:15,390
YJ MINUS J equals zero.

1104
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:17,800
Okay?

1105
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,920
Okay.
So everybody's on their budget said,

1106
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:25,660
so he's on his budget set.
She or he's on his budget,

1107
01:07:25,661 --> 01:07:28,960
said she's going to be on her budget
set. Her budget set, by the way,

1108
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:33,820
is better than his because her budget
set is going to look like this,

1109
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,280
right?
It's gotta be parallel to his cause.

1110
01:07:36,281 --> 01:07:39,820
The price is she faces are the same
and her endowments worth more than his.

1111
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:43,600
So her budget says further out.
Okay?

1112
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:47,830
So that's what he does. That's what
she does. Or that's what she does.

1113
01:07:47,831 --> 01:07:50,350
That's what he does. And
now the fifth one, okay,

1114
01:07:50,351 --> 01:07:53,110
so now we have the two mysterious
equations that are left.

1115
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:58,770
So how do we express the idea that
the choices XII and why I buy I,

1116
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,160
that's her. Okay. And
her budget's, you know,

1117
01:08:03,161 --> 01:08:06,070
she's going to optimize by
choosing here somewhere,

1118
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:08,230
okay?

1119
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:10,330
This is her indifference
curve, right? Looked like that.

1120
01:08:10,331 --> 01:08:14,920
So that's what she's going to do. And
remember, he decides he's going to choose.

1121
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:19,730
So how can you turn her choice
and his choice into an equation?

1122
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:21,140
Well,

1123
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:26,140
this was invented by a
German Guy Goslin's in 1851

1124
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:31,800
and then rediscovered by
Jeavons Manga and wall Ross.

1125
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:35,730
Same three I mentioned several times.
Now,

1126
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:38,430
this is the marginal
revolution in economics.

1127
01:08:38,431 --> 01:08:43,230
What they said is you can turn
the behavior of, of individuals,

1128
01:08:43,231 --> 01:08:45,270
of humans,
as Gossan said,

1129
01:08:45,271 --> 01:08:49,710
I can do for the bodies on earth with
Copernicus did for the bodies and heaven

1130
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:52,380
find equations that describe their motion.

1131
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:56,040
What is it that people are going to do
to say that you're choosing the best

1132
01:08:56,041 --> 01:09:00,090
possible thing means that the slope of
the budget set is equal to the slope of

1133
01:09:00,091 --> 01:09:03,210
your indifference curve. But what is
the slope of your indifference curve?

1134
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,910
That's the trade off between x and y.
Okay,

1135
01:09:05,911 --> 01:09:09,810
so what does it mean if you
get a little bit more less,

1136
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:14,310
you get a little bit less x,
you're losing the margin utility of x.

1137
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:18,150
You can a little bit more why you're
gaining the margin utility of y.

1138
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:20,400
If the price of x and y are the same,

1139
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:24,780
then it had better be that the Mars
utility of x is equal to the marginal

1140
01:09:24,781 --> 01:09:25,770
utility of why?

1141
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:29,460
Because you could always give up one
unit of acts and get one unit of why.

1142
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:33,720
If this is optimal and you could give
up one unit of x and get to and get two

1143
01:09:33,721 --> 01:09:37,700
units, sorry if the margin Tillery Foy
was double the margin utility vacs,

1144
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:39,000
then you would give up that one,
you know,

1145
01:09:39,001 --> 01:09:43,650
the Max and you get two extra you tiles
by taking the one unit of why what you

1146
01:09:43,651 --> 01:09:46,720
can afford by selling one univacs
and utility would be, you know,

1147
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:51,720
much higher than it was here. And so, um,
you wouldn't be optimizing by doing that.

1148
01:09:51,870 --> 01:09:56,870
So the final equation is you're optimizing
if and only if the margin utility of

1149
01:09:59,281 --> 01:10:04,281
Roi of x divided by the margin utility
of I have y equals px over p y.

1150
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:14,040
Okay. And, and for, and the last
equation is the same thing for Jay.

1151
01:10:14,041 --> 01:10:19,041
The margin Youtube William J of x divided
by the margin utility of Jay of why

1152
01:10:20,611 --> 01:10:23,670
has the equal px over p y

1153
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:29,530
is a why is that? Again, that's the
whole, that's the trickiest equation.

1154
01:10:29,531 --> 01:10:34,390
That's the one that Marx and Adam
Smith and not even Ricard on the most

1155
01:10:34,391 --> 01:10:38,080
brilliant one of the mall.
Not even Ricardo, could figure
that out. This equation,

1156
01:10:38,081 --> 01:10:42,160
marginal utility wait until
1871 and again to repeat it,

1157
01:10:42,161 --> 01:10:44,740
it's of course very obvious now,
but wasn't at the time.

1158
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,440
How can you describe what
these people are doing?

1159
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:50,710
You have to figure out the budget
constraint. That's what they can afford.

1160
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:53,590
And then they're going to choose the
point on their budget constraint,

1161
01:10:54,070 --> 01:10:56,020
which maximizes their utility.
Okay?

1162
01:10:56,021 --> 01:10:59,830
But that just means in the picture makes
the indifference curve tangent to the

1163
01:10:59,831 --> 01:11:04,030
budget set, which means that
you set so, and what does it,

1164
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:08,770
what is the slope of the indifference
curve while the trade off between x and y?

1165
01:11:08,771 --> 01:11:10,030
That leaves you in different,

1166
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:15,030
how much acts do you have to give up
and take to get an extra unit of y and

1167
01:11:15,031 --> 01:11:15,930
still be in different,

1168
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:19,950
it's determined by the ratio of the margin
utility of x to the margin utility of

1169
01:11:19,951 --> 01:11:23,820
why? Because those are the, you
know, when you give up a unit of x,

1170
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:27,180
you're losing the march utility of x
when you're getting a unit of why you're

1171
01:11:27,181 --> 01:11:30,510
getting the margin utility of why.
If you can trade them off in the market,

1172
01:11:30,511 --> 01:11:35,010
it's three to one. You optimize
when in your own personal valuation,

1173
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:38,820
you're trading them off on the margin
at three to one. Okay? So how is that?

1174
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:41,370
You really follow that?
Okay,

1175
01:11:41,371 --> 01:11:46,371
so that's an idea that took 50 years to
figure out and you claim you figured it

1176
01:11:46,711 --> 01:11:51,110
out now in five minutes. So
that's good. So, so anyway, I, uh,

1177
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,510
so you'll have a chance of the
problem set to get practice with.

1178
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:59,010
So those are the equations we
now basically have described, um,

1179
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:00,450
economic Ecqua Librium.

1180
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:05,480
So we now have the ability to play with
all kinds of models as we'll start in

1181
01:12:05,551 --> 01:12:08,850
the next class doing,
solving for economic equilibrium,

1182
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:12,540
figuring out what will happen and then
complicating it by adding a financial

1183
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:15,630
sector and see how that affects,
affects what goes on in equilibrium.
