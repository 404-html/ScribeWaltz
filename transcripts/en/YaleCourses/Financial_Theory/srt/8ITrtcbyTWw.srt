1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,230
Now the course,
just to summarize again,

2
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:09,231
the course is the standard financial
theory course that was made popular over

3
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:13,250
the last 10 years and a bunch of
business schools where they and,

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,550
and those guys who develop this material
basically thought that markets were

5
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:20,790
great and it was,
finance was almost a separate part,

6
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:24,870
could be walled off from much
of economics. So here at yeah,

7
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:26,670
we've never taught finance that way.

8
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:31,140
We've always taught it as
a part of economics and the
crisis reasonably I think

9
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:34,980
has made it clear that that's probably
the way one should really think about the

10
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:39,000
problem. So it's become very
fashionable now to say that, you know,

11
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:43,800
financial theorists had everything all
wrong and to ask how it is that they got

12
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:46,260
everything all wrong,
why didn't they anticipate the crash?

13
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:51,261
And this two standard critiques of a
standard financial economics are a,

14
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:56,250
it didn't allow for, um, psychology.

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,090
And you'll hear about that from
Schiller next semester. And B,

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,240
it didn't take into account collateral
and it was all done in a very special

17
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:09,280
case. A, a knife edge
case. And that's what,

18
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,690
and that if you looked at it a little bit
more broadly, you would see you would,

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,553
you would reach,

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,040
you would realize that the kind of
crisis we've had now is not such an

21
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:20,310
unfathomable we'll thing. In fact,
it's happened many times before.

22
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,860
So that's the perspective I'm
going to take in this class.

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,450
So to put it a different way, Krugman,
very recently in the New York Times,

24
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:31,140
you may have read his magazine
article, uh, road exactly that,

25
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:32,820
that there are two problems maybe that,
you know,

26
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:35,640
that financial theory has failed us.
Why has it failed as well?

27
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:39,720
Because it didn't have psychology
and it didn't have collateral. And,

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,540
uh,
he didn't talk much about the collateral,

29
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:45,690
which is obviously something that he's
not thought very much about before.

30
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,920
But together with the collateral,
he sort of said, you know, it's uh,

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,900
too much. Uh, how did he put it? He said,

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,550
too much seduction by mathematics.
The,

33
00:01:57,551 --> 00:02:00,960
the financial economists were seduced
by their own mathematics into believing

34
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:04,500
stuff that a sensible person who didn't
pay enough to pay so much attention to

35
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:06,960
mathematics wouldn't do well.

36
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,440
Although the critique in this course is
going to be partly based on collateral,

37
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,230
the rest of recruitment said,
I completely disagree with.

38
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:19,680
I regard that as a kind of
Taliban approach to economics.

39
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,590
You know the more technology
and fire power you use,

40
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,060
the more you're going to be misled.

41
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,190
That's what the Taliban believe and they
want to get rid of modern technology

42
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,210
and you know,
return to first principles.

43
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,590
So I think in fact the problem with modern
finance was not too much mathematics

44
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:35,880
but too little mathematics.

45
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,910
And they made these very
special simplifying assumptions
and didn't realize how

46
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:44,490
important the assumptions were to
the conclusions. So we're going to,

47
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,300
we examine all that and that's
what we're starting at now.

48
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,040
We're going to consider, first of all
the argument that free markets work best.

49
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,900
So we started with a little example, a
Oh by the way, the first problem set,

50
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:59,770
if I didn't mention it,
is due Tuesday.

51
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:02,830
So you need to bring it
to class and we'll have,

52
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,810
and you're going to turn it into each of,

53
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,450
there'll be a box with each of
your section leaders names on it.

54
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:11,530
So supposedly you're been able to sign
up for sections by now, is that right?

55
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,550
Anyway, it's on the web. So you pick a
section and sign up for it. And you know,

56
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:18,100
if you wait too long,
you're sectional fill up the time.

57
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,120
So there are eight sections. You ought
to be able to find one of them that,

58
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,750
that fits your schedule and you need
to turn it on on Tuesday in class.

59
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,810
By the end of class. You know, maybe you
can scribble something during the class,

60
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:31,510
but by the end of the class we're
going to take the problem sets.

61
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,150
And after that it's too late
to hand them in. So you know,

62
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:37,330
all of you are going to have problems.
You're going to have, you know, midnight,

63
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:39,010
a session,
all nights,

64
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,070
things they're going to have to do
to for some other course, you know,

65
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:45,490
grandmothers are going to die. All
sorts of things are gonna happen. Uh,

66
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,470
but we don't take the problem sets late.

67
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,040
So you ha there'll be 10 problem sets
and we're only going to count nine of the

68
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:55,600
grades, so you'll have one
free pass. And, um, you know,

69
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:58,810
that's what life is and it's just too
complicated to keep track of people

70
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:00,010
handing them late all the time.

71
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,130
The answers are going to go on
the web right after the class.

72
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,430
And so it's just in the past,
you know,

73
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:10,000
we negotiated with every person who
was late and it's just too complicated.

74
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:14,380
And when you make a simple rule, you
know, grandmothers don't die anymore.

75
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,410
So anyway, that's how we're
going to a work at in the class.

76
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,380
You just have to turn it in and you know,
if there are 10 of them,

77
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,780
only nine count.
If you miss one all together,

78
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:25,600
it's really not going to change your
grade anyway. If you miss half of them,

79
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,090
that's going to have some
effect on your grade.

80
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:32,080
And so I don't encourage you to do that,
but I'm sure you won't do that. Okay.

81
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:35,380
So I think that's all the
preliminaries are two midterms,

82
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:37,900
one in the middle of the class
and one right at the end. Anyway,

83
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,220
the question we want to spend the whole
of the class on today is whether the

84
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:45,270
free market is really such a great idea.
And the,

85
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,400
the quintessential example in which it
is a great idea is the one we did in

86
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:54,610
class on the very first day we had a
bunch of football tickets and there were

87
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:57,520
buyers, each of whom knew his
own valuation and sellers,

88
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:59,680
each of whom knew her own valuation.

89
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:04,360
And we threw everybody together and
just very briefly explained the rules.

90
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:04,960
By the way,

91
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,340
the only important rule was there were
two important rules you had to announce

92
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:12,940
publicly and loudly what price you
are offering. That's very important.

93
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:15,730
You don't have any secret deals
that would've screwed everything up.

94
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,450
And secondly, we had a rule about once
you make a deal, what happens? You know,

95
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:23,410
how does the thing actually get
transferred? And you know, so there was a,

96
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:26,920
one of the ta stood by and wrote it
down and the two people exchange the

97
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:30,970
footballs and you know, agreed to
it and walked off stage. So this,

98
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,210
the actual mechanics of the
transaction, uh, you know,

99
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:37,210
to make sure that the person turning
over the money actually gets the football

100
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,940
ticket.
That of course it's incredibly important.

101
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,330
And that's the thing that gets
left out often in finance.

102
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:45,700
That's the collateral business
that we're going to come to later.

103
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:49,070
How do you know that the guys actually
going to pay you? What he promises? Well,

104
00:05:49,071 --> 00:05:52,810
he's got to put up collateral and so
that you can trust him. So we're gonna.

105
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,000
So without that there would
have been a big problem.

106
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:58,580
And what we're going to come talk about
that in the old days when you bought a

107
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:02,390
stock, someone on a bicycle would
carry the certificate, you know,

108
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,800
from one place,
you know,

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,890
someone would carry the check from one
guy to another guy and the person then,

110
00:06:08,891 --> 00:06:10,820
then the bicyclist would
get off as you know,

111
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:15,650
we'd get the stock certificates and, and
ride the bike back to the, to the buyer.

112
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,160
So it was a, you know, if one broker
to another broker and the Co, you know,

113
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:20,690
sometimes it took a couple of hours.

114
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:24,290
So there was a spacing in between when
the guy gave over the money and when the

115
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:28,130
guy got the stock back and uh, you
know, you have to allow for that.

116
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:30,910
Maybe we'd take a couple of days
to process on everybody's books.

117
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:34,340
So there's a thing called x dividend.
When you buy a stock,

118
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,740
you know the old buyer continues to
get the dividends for awhile until the,

119
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,780
the old owner until a particular date
after which the new buyer starts getting

120
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:45,350
the dividends,
if there are any.

121
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,040
And everybody has to understand that
cause after you allow for the, the, the,

122
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,550
the actual trading technology. So all
those things are going to come up later.

123
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:54,440
And they were in the
background of this example,

124
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:58,130
but nevermind that the point
now is that these people,

125
00:06:58,131 --> 00:07:00,080
everybody just knew their own valuation,

126
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:04,850
not anybody else's valuation and
chaos ensued, hardly any rules.

127
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,360
And miraculously, almost instantly
with less than two minutes,

128
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:13,510
they figured out what to do
and they manage to get the
football tickets into the

129
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:16,970
hands of the people who
liked them the most.

130
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,970
And I'm going to just say that
slightly more mathematically.

131
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,020
You could model what everybody did
as having a utility function, uh,

132
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,820
for football tickets.
Okay. So the top person,

133
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:33,821
Mr 44 gets utility of 44 for having
one ticket and tickets beyond that.

134
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,230
Don't give him extra any utility,
just you still utility 44 similarly,

135
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,990
ms six there at the bottom,
she had utility six for a football ticket,

136
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,570
but there's also money in the background.

137
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:52,571
So the the welfare function depended on
the football tickets and money and was

138
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:58,310
you ax plus m.
So why does that capture what went on?

139
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,490
Because Mr 44 knowing that the football
tickets worth 44 he would say to

140
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:06,290
himself, should I get a ticket
or not get a ticket? Well,

141
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:10,640
if the price is under 40 for the amount
of money he gives up and loses is going

142
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:13,790
to be less than the amount of utility
gains for the football tickets.

143
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,640
So therefore he'll buy the ticket.
So this utility function,

144
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:20,190
you x plus m captures,
the idea is, you know,

145
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:24,620
represents the goals of the
people involved in the experiment.

146
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,760
Each of them has a different view of x,
but all of them are the form Ux plus m.

147
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:33,650
And so the conclusion was of the
experiment and of the theory supply equals

148
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:34,101
demand.

149
00:08:34,101 --> 00:08:37,070
The conclusion is that the
football tickets are going
to end up in the hands of

150
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:41,450
the people who like them the best.
So what does that mean?

151
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,240
That means that enact Librium

152
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,500
inaccurate Librium uh,
uh,

153
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,250
the final allocation
allocation

154
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,950
maximizes
total welfare.

155
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,980
Okay. Now what does
that mean? Well, if you,

156
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,990
each person I has a different
utility function. Okay?

157
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:18,640
And so if you add up over all the people,
ah,

158
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,470
you get the total welfare
of every single person,

159
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,780
they economies total welfare and it's,

160
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,390
I'm now about to prove,

161
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,950
but it should be obvious that total
welfare is maximized at that equilibrium

162
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:35,730
that you actually found in class almost.
It was just one tiny,

163
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:40,080
tiny deviation from the
theory. Nobody made a mistake
by the way, you know, but I,

164
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,790
I think I mentioned this many times,

165
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,940
I've done this experiment before and
you know, Mr uh, let's say Miss 30,

166
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,040
well we'll say Mr 20 in Mr 12 gets so
upset that he can't buy any ticket and

167
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:56,100
he's standing there, you know, with,
you know, you know, embarrassed.

168
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:58,680
Then everyone else has traded and he's
still sitting there with his original

169
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:02,340
football ticket. He ends up bidding 30
or something to get a football ticket.

170
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:05,450
Okay. Nobody made a mistake
this time. And so it, it,

171
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,040
it happened almost as
the theory predicted.

172
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:12,150
So let's just think of the theoretical
outcome in the theoretical outcome where

173
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:15,050
the price is 25 and those
topic people have it,

174
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,900
that final allocation maximizes
total welfare. Why is that? Well,

175
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:20,550
whatever the money distribution was,

176
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:25,551
you couldn't change total welfare because
if I give up some of his money to her,

177
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:28,860
to Jay, the total amount of
money, it's still the same.

178
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,200
And if you add up the
welfares of all the people,

179
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:33,330
you're just going to get the total
of amount of money on the right.

180
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:36,540
And it won't make any difference.
So therefore to maximize welfare,

181
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,380
all you have to do is
maximize the sum of you have.

182
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,500
You have to put the football tickets in
the hands of the people who want them

183
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:47,520
the most. That's going to maximize
welfare because, um, that maximizes the,

184
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,880
some of the Ui of exes and
rearranging the MS doesn't matter.

185
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:56,010
So we found an equilibrium that
echo Librium maximize total welfare.

186
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:01,130
So that was the original argument for
why equilibrium was such a great idea.

187
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,130
The greatest good to the greatest
number became mathematical.

188
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,420
It maximizes the sum of welfare. So the
sum of utilities, they called it, okay?

189
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:11,430
That was the utilitarian,

190
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,740
utilitarian view of economics.
Utilitarian view.

191
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,600
Okay. And that's sort of the
view that was prevailed in 1871.

192
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,700
All right. Now they made one
generalization from that we found before,

193
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,480
which is that if you think of
not eight different buyers,

194
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,780
but one buyer or maybe two
different buyers, you know,

195
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:38,100
who's where the utility functions are,
this concave function.

196
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,280
So their Ui of x plus m where you evacs
Ui of one could be 44 and UI of two

197
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,010
could be 44 plus 40,
which is 84.

198
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:52,180
That consolidated person
would behave exactly like, uh,

199
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:57,170
the individual. He buys as many
tickets as they would collectively. Um,

200
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,750
and so nothing would change.
The football tickets will,

201
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,620
would still end up in the hands of
the people. One of them the most,

202
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,340
maybe it would be one guy who held
three tickets instead of three different

203
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:06,731
people,

204
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:11,260
but the tickets would still be in the
hands of the highest valuation holders.

205
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,600
And so you would get
exactly the same conclusion.

206
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:19,410
One last lesson from that example
is that the price turned out to be,

207
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,100
have nothing to do with the
total value or football tickets.

208
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:26,140
The price turned out to be equal,

209
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:29,950
more or less to what the marginal buyer
in the marginal seller thought it was

210
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:33,100
worth. So Mr 26th, and Mr and Miss 24,

211
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,600
they're the ones who control the price.
What 44 thought was totally irrelevant.

212
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,110
So that was why it was called the
marginal revolution in economics.

213
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,620
So Adam Smith who was so
puzzled because he said,

214
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:49,510
water is so valuable and has such a
low price and diamonds are so useless.

215
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:52,420
Really, when it comes down to it
and they have such a high price,

216
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:57,330
the answer to his puzzle is simply yes.
Water at the beginning. And you know,

217
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:02,170
Ms 44 will be 44,000, whereas if
we had a same model for diamonds,

218
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,080
uh, sorry, um,

219
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,690
diamonds would also be
very big at the beginning,

220
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:11,320
but the point is there's so much water
in the economy that the marginal value of

221
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:14,280
an extra gallon of water is not very high.
Um,

222
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,860
the marginal value of water is low,
even though the total value,

223
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:20,590
which is the area under the
demand curve is very high. Okay?

224
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:24,280
So that's the lesson that we
learned, um, in the first class.

225
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,430
And now we want to generalize
this to a much, um,

226
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:33,180
more sophisticated model and one but one
you can still compute very easily and

227
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:38,110
we're going to see how these special
assumptions don't quite work so well. Uh,

228
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,880
okay. So, yes. Sorry. Please. Yeah,

229
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:45,070
please interrupt me at
anytime with questions. Yes.

230
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,120
Can you explain again?

231
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,343
Yes.

232
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:01,240
Okay. Um, so her question
is, I said very quickly,

233
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:06,070
which you'll see later.
I pressed the button too soon.

234
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,110
If I press down and it's halfway up,

235
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:10,900
does that just break the
whole thing or anyway,

236
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,170
okay.
So her question is I she wants,

237
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,490
she would like to know
again why it is that uh,

238
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,750
I can sort of combine people
into one person and what didn't,

239
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:28,750
what do I mean by that? So what I
meant by that is if I have two people,

240
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:33,460
Mr 44 and Mr 40, I'm taking the buyers
to be, he's and the sellers to be hers.

241
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,110
I have to two guys,

242
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:38,770
44 and 40 and I said any price,

243
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,640
if the price is above 44,
neither of them will want to buy.

244
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:46,810
If it's between 44 and 40, just mister
40, we'll buy in. If it's below 40,

245
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,570
both of them will buy now.
Suppose instead.

246
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,040
But each of those guys
is only in one ticket.

247
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:57,350
Mr 40 Ford Utility as Ui Ui of one is 44,

248
00:14:57,351 --> 00:15:00,650
Ui of two was still 44, he doesn't
get anything out of a second ticket.

249
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,100
Suppose now I had a third person, uh, uh,

250
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:07,910
a bigger person whose utility,
you know,

251
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:12,920
k of one is 44 and UK
if two is 84 44 plus 40.

252
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:18,050
So that person now is a, is a bigger
guy. Uh, he's interested in more tickets.

253
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,190
That's what I mean by bigger,

254
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,390
he's going to behave himself
exactly the same way.

255
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,880
The other two separate
people behaved collectively.

256
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,730
So if the price is above 44,

257
00:15:28,731 --> 00:15:31,520
he won't buy either ticket
because if it's above,

258
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:33,620
if it's 50 and he buys one ticket,

259
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,980
he'll have lost 50 and
he'll have gain 44 noodles.

260
00:15:36,981 --> 00:15:39,830
So he will have been worse off than when
he started and he certainly won't buy

261
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:44,510
to be even worse off. If the price is
between 44 and 40, he'll say to himself,

262
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,720
this is the marginal revolution.
If I buy the first ticket,

263
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:52,460
I pay a 42 and I get 44 out of it.

264
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:53,960
So I've gained two you dials.

265
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,100
But now if I think about buying
a second ticket for 44, 42,

266
00:15:58,101 --> 00:16:00,290
and I only get 40 out of it,
I'm going to start losing.

267
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,120
So I'll stop with one ticket.

268
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,690
So that guy will behave
exactly the same way.

269
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:07,440
The two people separately behave.

270
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:09,620
So whether it's two guys
separately or one guy together,

271
00:16:09,621 --> 00:16:13,070
it doesn't make any difference there.
Total actions. Exactly the same.

272
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,150
And in the end,

273
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,440
the football tickets have ended in the
hands of the people liked them the most.

274
00:16:18,441 --> 00:16:22,800
Maybe I need a lot of more water than you
do. Um, but it felt, you know, but if,

275
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,870
if I need it much more than you do,
then all those gallons, you know,

276
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:31,400
the first few, maybe the first 20 gallons
I drank, I needed more than, than uh,

277
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,980
you know, your first gallon.
And after that, you know,

278
00:16:33,981 --> 00:16:37,600
you started needing water
as much as I did. Something
like that. So the, the, the,

279
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:41,930
the tickets or the water ends up in
the hands of whoever needs it most.

280
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:47,300
And it may be that they're more than
one unit in each person's hands. Okay.

281
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,660
Any other questions before
I raise the thing again?

282
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,310
All right, now I want to join. So
that sounds all very convincing,

283
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:57,830
but it's not going to turn
out to be quite so convincing.

284
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,360
So let's try and generalize this
model to a more sophisticated thing.

285
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,620
And so I'm following an example which is
in the notes. So you'll find that most,

286
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,550
you know, if you read the notes, um,

287
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:18,350
you know, oh, so the textbooks,
because the approach I take, you know,

288
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:21,710
and that we take it, Yale is quite
different from the standard approach.

289
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,870
You're not going to be
able to follow a textbook.

290
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,990
That's why I give you a whole list of
textbooks. I encourage you to read them.

291
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:28,940
They're great books. They're
famous people. I, there are,

292
00:17:28,941 --> 00:17:32,480
most of them are quite good friends
of mine, so I endorse them all,

293
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,600
but they're differently
presented than this course.

294
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:39,650
And that's why you need to rely on
the, on the notes a little bit. Okay?

295
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:43,130
So let's just take this, uh, example of,

296
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:49,440
um, the first example. Suppose
now that we have two gods,

297
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,040
but they're

298
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,520
going to be continuous. The, you know,

299
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,540
you don't have to have just one
football ticket or two football tickets.

300
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,860
We have two goods which are going to
call x and Y and we've got two agents,

301
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:03,000
a and B. And so WIA of x, f of x and y.

302
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:07,380
That's the welfare function like we
had before. Okay. Is going to be,

303
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,640
um,
whatever.

304
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:13,641
I had a hundred x minus one half x
squared plus Y and I'll s and now Viet v

305
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,390
endowments of chords,
which I was a little bit

306
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,490
fast and loose about before he a of x,

307
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,830
e a of why all cough.

308
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,910
That's the endowment of a,
okay,

309
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:34,911
how much he has to begin with the
facts and why I say it's four and 5,000

310
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,970
okay. And then let's make
it another person. Wb

311
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:46,710
is welfare function or let's say his and
her welfare function is 30 x minus one

312
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:53,320
half x squared plus y and her endowment,

313
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,180
e B,
a,

314
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:58,780
B of x and Eby of why

315
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,800
equals
80 and 1000.

316
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:11,840
Okay?

317
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,840
So this is supposed to be shorthand for
an economy in which there are thousands

318
00:19:17,451 --> 00:19:21,680
of people, millions of people, every
person characterized by the utility.

319
00:19:21,681 --> 00:19:26,681
They get the goals they have over the
consumption goods and they're starting

320
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:30,140
endowments and they're all going to be
thrown together and expect it to trade.

321
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:34,280
Another example, we can do one more
exam. Another example. Let's say

322
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,270
don't work out both of these,

323
00:19:38,271 --> 00:19:42,470
the same kind of examples you're going to
do on the problem set. Another example,

324
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,680
sorry,
I can't remember my examples.

325
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:48,680
I won't meet to look at these
after I write the examples down.

326
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,453
Okay.

327
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:58,840
Okay, so another one is WC of x.

328
00:19:58,841 --> 00:20:00,970
Y equals three quarters

329
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:08,390
log x plus one quarter log y
and he see the endowment of c

330
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,080
equals two and one.

331
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,940
And meanwhile I have another person d
of x and Y it's endowment is two thirds

332
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:33,331
log x plus one third log
y and her and downwind.

333
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,120
Yeah,

334
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,040
one, two. Okay. And of course I could have

335
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,440
had an economy in which they
were all there at the same time,

336
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:52,840
but I'm going to just keep
them to do two examples.

337
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,780
So you see the economy
consists of many people,

338
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,170
many goods may be many people and uh,

339
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,570
each with different endowments
and different utilities.

340
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:04,540
And if you throw them all together,
what's going to happen? Okay?

341
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:08,620
And so we have a theory now, a theory of
equilibrium that explains what happens.

342
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,530
And we can use that.
A few tricks,

343
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:15,190
which I'm going to teach you now to
actually solve concretely for what's going

344
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:18,790
to happen in each of these cases. It's
very simple. And of course we haven't.

345
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:23,140
And the next step is going to be to add
finance to it and financial variables.

346
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:25,980
But in the, at the bottom, we still
want to have economic variables.

347
00:21:25,981 --> 00:21:29,710
See here we've got the consumption of
two different codes, x and Y, okay?

348
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:34,060
And we want to see what's
going to happen. All right? So

349
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:40,650
aqua Librium is always defined
by turning things into equations.

350
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,850
So we said the equations
here are going to be that.

351
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,770
So what is a going to do?

352
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,680
Well,
the indulgent has variables.

353
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,080
VN dodginess variables

354
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:05,990
are going to be Px,
p y,

355
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,800
x, a, x, y, a.

356
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,360
Okay.

357
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,430
XB. And why me? That's what
everybody has to decide in the end.

358
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,570
A has to decide the prices
have to emerge for x and y.

359
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:22,840
We're assuming again that these people
by the one I have one agent a and one

360
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,290
agent B, I really mean there's
a million agents, just like a,

361
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,050
an a million agents just like be,

362
00:22:28,051 --> 00:22:30,970
and they're all shouting and screaming
at each other and they're in some kind of

363
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,850
market.
So if there's only one agent of each type,

364
00:22:33,851 --> 00:22:37,870
there'd be bargaining and
threats and be very complicated.

365
00:22:37,871 --> 00:22:40,480
But with lots of people of each type,
that's what I'm talking about.

366
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:43,990
So when our football player example,
there were football ticket example,

367
00:22:43,991 --> 00:22:47,440
there were 16 people competing with each
other and you don't really need much

368
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:51,070
more than three or four or five on a side,
um,

369
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:55,060
at least for to get,
you know, competition.

370
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,530
So with enough competition,

371
00:22:56,531 --> 00:23:00,100
the theory says the prices are going to
emerge and people are going to look at

372
00:23:00,101 --> 00:23:03,580
the prices and decide how
much they want to buy,

373
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:05,050
what do they want to end up consuming?

374
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:09,190
So a has to make his decisions and
bs to make her decisions. And, uh,

375
00:23:09,191 --> 00:23:14,140
so those are the indogenous variables.
The exogenous variables were all of the,

376
00:23:14,141 --> 00:23:17,650
you know, 80 1,001 half, you know,

377
00:23:17,651 --> 00:23:21,490
one times y a hundred times x.
All those numbers are,

378
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,510
are exogenous. The utility functions,
the endowments are exogenous.

379
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:27,580
So these are all the exogenous things.

380
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,030
So the theory is going to say,

381
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:38,830
how do you go from exogenous to endogenous
and it's going to be just a bunch of

382
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:40,990
equations. So what, what
are they each wanted to do?

383
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,070
So a is going to maximize

384
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,840
Wia evacs

385
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,480
and why such that as we said,
the critical insight,

386
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:58,481
the budget constraint was p why of why
less than or equal to m p x times e a x

387
00:24:04,671 --> 00:24:09,560
plus p y times e a why?
But we know what these numbers are.

388
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,920
Ea x is um,

389
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,040
four and he a why is 5,000
so a takes it for granted.

390
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,310
Theory says it's, it's
very shocking, but it's a,

391
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,030
takes it for granted that she could be,

392
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:29,270
that he can sell all of his
endowment if he wanted to,

393
00:24:29,271 --> 00:24:34,271
four units of x and 5,000 units of y and
get the money from doing that and use

394
00:24:35,631 --> 00:24:39,190
the money to spend on his final
consumption's. Let's go this x say,

395
00:24:39,191 --> 00:24:44,191
and why on his final
consumptions of a x of x say and,

396
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,220
and why Aa.
So let's call this,

397
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:51,800
let's leave out the A's here for a minute
because those are the choices he has.

398
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,150
He wants to Max over x and y.
So there are many possibilities.

399
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,180
It has to satisfy this budget constraint.
And similarly,

400
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:03,280
why is going to be maximizing,
uh,

401
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,650
over x and y WB of x, y. Okay.

402
00:25:08,651 --> 00:25:12,790
Such that x, x plus p. Why,

403
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:17,791
why less than or equal to g x
times 80 was p y times a thousand.

404
00:25:19,281 --> 00:25:22,910
I think I remember the
numbers finally. Okay, so,

405
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:29,390
and now what we want to do is we want to
solve for these variables so that when

406
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:34,230
a taking px and pys given maximizes
his utility function, he'll choose x.

407
00:25:34,231 --> 00:25:36,440
Say an XP and B,

408
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:41,000
we'll choose y a and why be
such that demand? Equal supply.

409
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:45,800
Okay. And so I'm going to write, um,

410
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,960
over here, maybe demand equal
supply. So we know that in the end,

411
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:53,540
so the choices,
so whatever these choices are,

412
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,800
they're going to lead to him choosing x.

413
00:25:55,801 --> 00:26:00,800
Say and why a and her
choosing xb and why B.

414
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,520
And it's gotta be that x plus x,

415
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:09,521
B equals e a x plus e a B,

416
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:15,430
which equals four plus 80 equals
84 and it's gotta be that.

417
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,600
Why a plus.

418
00:26:17,601 --> 00:26:22,601
Why B has to equal e a y plus.

419
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:27,320
Eby. Sorry, bad,

420
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,330
which equals

421
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:35,780
5,000 was 1000,
which equals 6,000.

422
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,860
Okay, I hope I remembered everything. So

423
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,060
all right, so those are of the
equation suppliers to equal demand.

424
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:45,511
And what are the,

425
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:50,000
and now let's just do a little trick here
to get some of the other equations. A,

426
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:53,610
he's going to spend all his money.
What's the point in not spending money?

427
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:56,490
Because the more x he has and
the more why he has really more,

428
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:58,890
why has the better off he is,
he's not going to waste money.

429
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,350
So this is going to turn
out to be an equality here.

430
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:02,900
Okay?

431
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,380
Okay. So that's actually an
equation, not just the a variable.

432
00:27:06,381 --> 00:27:09,350
So p x times x a,

433
00:27:09,351 --> 00:27:12,400
now the actual solution plus um,

434
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:17,620
p y times y a has to
equal x times four plus p.

435
00:27:20,151 --> 00:27:24,830
Why Times 5,000? That's,
that's an equation.

436
00:27:24,831 --> 00:27:27,950
And then similarly,
why she's not going to waste her money.

437
00:27:27,951 --> 00:27:31,760
She's going to spend it
all if she's optimizing. So
this'll turn into inequality.

438
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:35,900
And so this'll give p y p x times x,

439
00:27:35,901 --> 00:27:40,901
B Plus p y times y B equals px
times 80 plus p y tons of thousand.

440
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:50,130
So we've got four equations and now
we have to do the marginal equation.

441
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,580
Crucial marginally equation.
So what does that say?

442
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,570
That says one eight. Okay, we
talked about this last time.

443
00:27:57,571 --> 00:27:59,400
You've all seen it before.
So I can go quickly.

444
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:02,400
But this was the critical insight
that took years to develop marks.

445
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:04,350
Couldn't figure it out
until his dying day.

446
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:08,790
He was trying to understand what these
marginal guys were doing. And so you know,

447
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:12,420
so the idea is that the margin you to,

448
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:15,900
if you've optimized by choosing x a Xb,

449
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:20,520
if he's optimized choosing x Ane Xb, it
has to be that the last dollar he spent,

450
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,160
he was indifferent
between where he spent it.

451
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,890
Otherwise he would've moved at all
or from one thing to the other thing.

452
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,990
So it has to be that the margin utility

453
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,710
of X.
Okay.

454
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:36,390
At x a n y a divided by the price of x.

455
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,120
So what is that?
What's the margin utility of x?

456
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,100
It's a hundred minus.
That's a derivative of acts.

457
00:28:43,101 --> 00:28:45,050
A hundred minus two times a half,

458
00:28:45,051 --> 00:28:49,770
100 minus X.
Okay.

459
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:54,770
Has to equal the margin
utility to a of why

460
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,080
divide by, sorry, I just meant to,

461
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,700
we've warmed here

462
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:10,590
equals the marginal utility of a,

463
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,340
a of why evaluated at Wa x a

464
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:19,100
n y a. Okay. Divided by the price of y.

465
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,740
So that equals one.

466
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:27,830
Okay.

467
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:31,190
Margin utility of why is just
one the drove of why is one

468
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,540
okay. And then we have to
write the same thing for B,

469
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:40,800
the margin utility out of y of x,

470
00:29:40,801 --> 00:29:43,750
B of a f, x for X. B.

471
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,250
And why be lied by the price of x.

472
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,470
So what is it for me?
It's 30 minus x

473
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,440
divided by Px.
Not very good.

474
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,290
Board management,
uh,

475
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,320
has deep wall and this is also going
to turn out to be one over p y equals

476
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:09,070
march.

477
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:14,070
Utility of B of y X.

478
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,150
Say X. B y B divided by p. Y.
Okay, so those are the equations.

479
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:22,840
Now is that make sense to everybody?

480
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,270
I think I need to pause for [inaudible].

481
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,950
I'm going to do exactly the same
thing with that other system,

482
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,910
but let's just see if we can
figure this out. Okay. That,

483
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,900
um,
you always right.

484
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:38,230
So equilibrium is this
very involved thing.

485
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:41,110
What everybody does depends on what
everybody else is going to do because how

486
00:30:41,111 --> 00:30:42,370
much did you pay for something?

487
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:45,370
Depends on how much you think you can
get it by offering it to some other guy.

488
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,710
You know, if there are million
A's and a million bees,

489
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:49,590
you're dealing with one of the bees,
maybe the other be,

490
00:30:49,591 --> 00:30:50,680
we'll give you a better deal.

491
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,290
So you have to think about what the
other people were doing before you can

492
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:57,860
decide what to do yourself. All that
is captured by the idea of the prices.

493
00:30:57,861 --> 00:31:01,780
Somehow people get into their minds what
the best deal they can get is that's

494
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:06,190
the prices px and p y.
Given those prices a,

495
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:10,930
each agent looks at his budget set or
her budget set and decides what to do and

496
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:15,850
what should they do? They should,
um, equate margin utilities.

497
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,170
That's the key insight.

498
00:31:17,171 --> 00:31:22,171
The margin utility per dollar of x has
to equal the margin utility per dollar of

499
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:26,590
why that just says that the budget set
is tangent to the indifference curve.

500
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,480
Okay?
That's what that says.

501
00:31:28,481 --> 00:31:32,620
So you take the ratio of margin utilities
and equals the ratio of prices and

502
00:31:32,621 --> 00:31:37,450
cross multiplying. It says the margin
utility per dollar. You know this,

503
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,380
this, the slope of the indifference
curve is margin utility,

504
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,970
let's say of a x of a
margin activity of y.

505
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,940
And the slope of the
budget set is px over p y.

506
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,320
So if I just put the px down here in the
margin utility up there that just says

507
00:31:53,321 --> 00:31:58,321
the margin chili of x divided by px equals
the marginal utility of y divided by

508
00:31:58,511 --> 00:31:59,320
p y.

509
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,880
That's something that you could
waste a huge amount of time on.

510
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:08,230
I don't have to do it because I know
that you all have seen it before and the

511
00:32:08,231 --> 00:32:12,580
one guy who hasn't seen it
before, um, is, you know,

512
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:17,010
going to figure it out himself. So, so,

513
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,990
okay. The Dean would've been, so we
have a tremendous advantage here.

514
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:22,930
I can just skip over that immediately
and make use of that fact. Okay.

515
00:32:22,931 --> 00:32:24,190
So that's the critical insight.

516
00:32:24,191 --> 00:32:28,480
You've taken this incredibly complicated
system and reduced it to a bunch of

517
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:30,190
equations,
which you can put on a computer,

518
00:32:30,191 --> 00:32:33,100
which is about what I'm about to do and
solve it with the flick of a button.

519
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:36,880
Okay. And, um, so are
there any questions here?

520
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:39,650
Let me pause again with how I got it.
Got these equations.

521
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:47,210
Okay. So it's a little bit complicated,
but of course, once you've understood it,

522
00:32:47,211 --> 00:32:48,590
it's not so complicated.

523
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:52,370
It reminds me a little bit now who
first thought of all this stuff.

524
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:56,270
The amazing thing is, incidentally,
these equations always have a solution.

525
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:00,890
You know, she had take, take typical
equations in any field, you know, physics,

526
00:33:00,891 --> 00:33:04,220
mathematics, you know, just
random equations. You know,

527
00:33:04,221 --> 00:33:07,430
they're not going to be solvable. I
mean, x squared plus one equals zero.

528
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:10,100
That's just one equation.
It doesn't have a solution.

529
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,610
And if you have simultaneous equations,
why should there be a solution?

530
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,970
The economic system always has a solution.

531
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:21,150
This was an astonishing
fact. First approved, uh,

532
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,290
by air all my thesis advisor,

533
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:29,310
the brew who did it at Yale
as an assistant professor
and didn't get tenure and

534
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:34,010
later won the Nobel prize. And, uh, this
happened several times at Yale, Arrow,

535
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:36,890
Debreu and um,
and Mckinsey

536
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:43,450
all separately of at least two guys
ended up writing a joint paper anyway.

537
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:47,330
Um, they found that this system
always, always has a solution.

538
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:50,450
There's something special
about the economic system
that has a solution that has

539
00:33:50,451 --> 00:33:52,250
to do with diminishing marginal utility,

540
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,290
which are not going to
talk about in this class.

541
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:55,910
But it's quite a fascinating thing.

542
00:33:55,911 --> 00:34:00,410
And they base their argument on
an argument that Nash had given,

543
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,670
uh, for games. And this whole thing
is very related to nash equilibrium.

544
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,590
And I'm sure you've heard of Nash and
many of you have maybe seen the movie a

545
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:13,310
beautiful mind. Well, about five
years ago, shortly, you know,

546
00:34:13,311 --> 00:34:16,180
a couple of years after
the movie came out, um,

547
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:20,200
Nash is still very much
alive and ever so slightly,

548
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,310
not quite as wacky as it used to be.

549
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:27,290
And so the Indian gain
theory society opened.

550
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:30,230
It was founded, believe it
or not, just five years ago,

551
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:32,780
despite all the brilliant
Indian economists,

552
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:35,360
the Game Theory Society was
founded about five years ago.

553
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:40,360
And they had an opening conference
where six people gave talks,

554
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:44,750
including Nash. So I was one of the
people who gave a talk. And, um,

555
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:48,290
there were thousands of people who
showed up mostly because of the movie.

556
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:51,800
And there's, I mean, there's just
thousands and thousands of people.

557
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,890
So afterwards we went on
tour to, uh, you know,

558
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,280
traveling to a bunch of different
cities and every city we went to,

559
00:34:58,281 --> 00:35:02,420
we get off the, the, uh, you
know, the, the, the train or
the limousine or something.

560
00:35:02,421 --> 00:35:04,780
It'd be a throng of people
there waiting to meet Nash.

561
00:35:04,781 --> 00:35:06,500
And there'd always be a press conference.

562
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:10,820
And after the press conference there'd
be a picture on the front page of

563
00:35:10,821 --> 00:35:13,910
whatever city, you know, and these
were all great cities, news, you know,

564
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,630
city we'd gone to and always there was
nash and everybody else was cropped out

565
00:35:17,631 --> 00:35:21,560
of the picture. But anyway, in
one of these first conferences,

566
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:26,360
I'm just illustrating, um, Nash
equilibrium here. Somebody said,

567
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,600
some reporters says, we've
seen the movie, you know,

568
00:35:29,601 --> 00:35:33,080
but can you really tell us in a word,
what is Nash Equilibrium?

569
00:35:33,081 --> 00:35:35,270
Competitive Equilibrium, what does
that, we're just seeing a word,

570
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:38,160
what does it mean? What does
it mean for us? And so each

571
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,010
of us took a try and trying to explain,
uh,

572
00:35:41,011 --> 00:35:45,930
what Nash equilibrium was
including Nash, the, the, the,

573
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,590
they didn't go too well,
the explanations until they got to Alman.

574
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,540
He was also one of the people who spoke
and he subsequently won the Nobel Prize.

575
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:58,770
Um, and, but anyway, at the time he hadn't
won it yet and he was, he's Israeli.

576
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:03,210
He's also a great figure.
And so Almand says, ah,

577
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,450
that question reminds me I
can't do his Israeli accent.

578
00:36:06,451 --> 00:36:11,250
That question reminds me of the
first press conference cruise. Jeff,

579
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,340
who you might remember was
premier of the Soviet Union.

580
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:18,960
This was in the time of Kennedy and
thumping the table and the Cold War and

581
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:19,201
stuff.

582
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:23,340
The first press conference Khrushchev
gave to Western reporters and somebody

583
00:36:23,341 --> 00:36:25,770
said,
can you tell me in a word,

584
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:30,720
describe in a word the health of the
Russian economy? And Khrushchev says,

585
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:35,970
good. And then the reporter says,
I didn't really mean one word,

586
00:36:35,971 --> 00:36:38,970
take two words and tell us what is
the health of the Russian economy.

587
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,910
And Khrushchev says, not good. So,

588
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:50,160
so,
so almond says in Echo,

589
00:36:50,161 --> 00:36:54,450
Librium in one word is
interaction in two words,

590
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,510
rational interaction.
So anyway, that was his,

591
00:36:57,511 --> 00:37:00,750
and so his definition managed to get
into the newspapers and none of ours did,

592
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:04,920
but so that pretty much summarizes it.
It's interaction but rational interaction.

593
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:05,941
So,

594
00:37:05,941 --> 00:37:10,650
and it's captured by the idea that
everybody anticipates the price and those

595
00:37:10,651 --> 00:37:12,870
prices are going to really
lead to the markets clearing.

596
00:37:12,871 --> 00:37:17,220
So they all are anticipating the right
prices and behaving as optimally as they

597
00:37:17,221 --> 00:37:21,240
can and choosing the best thing
in their budget sets. Okay. So

598
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:27,630
I, I, um, put this on a
computer and solved it,

599
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,620
which we're going to do in a second, but
there's a trick to solving this by hand.

600
00:37:31,621 --> 00:37:35,640
Okay? And so I might as well just do the
tricks by hand because on an exam for

601
00:37:35,641 --> 00:37:37,950
example, I'm not going to be able
to give, you're not going to,

602
00:37:37,951 --> 00:37:40,170
you're going to use the computer.
It's very simple.

603
00:37:40,171 --> 00:37:43,830
You'll see in one minute you can
solve this on a computer. But uh,

604
00:37:43,831 --> 00:37:47,280
by hand it's a,
it's worth knowing how to do.

605
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:51,000
And you probably know how to do
this. So, but let me describe it.

606
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:54,660
So what you do is you say,
um,

607
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,390
let's just look at the,
okay,

608
00:37:57,391 --> 00:38:02,391
so the first thing to observe is that the
prices don't really matter up to scale

609
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:07,230
or multiples vol. Ross, by the way,
it was the first made this argument.

610
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:10,020
So while Ross was, one
of them are, you know,

611
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:14,270
one of the marginalist
in 1871 from Roseanne.

612
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,460
So he says, look, doubling the
price isn't going to do anything.

613
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,250
It's just like changing
dollars into sense.

614
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,040
If you look at everybody's budget set
and you double px and he why you're

615
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:25,590
doubling both sides of the equation,
you're not doing anything.

616
00:38:25,591 --> 00:38:30,480
So if px and p y or part of an equilibrium
to px and two p y will also be part

617
00:38:30,481 --> 00:38:34,200
of the equilibrium because the price is
only appear here in the budget set and

618
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:35,740
doubling them all,
it doesn't do anything.

619
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,680
So really you might as well
assume that px equals one.

620
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,060
Okay?

621
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,490
Okay. So he says, well that
gets rid of one variable.

622
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:51,170
You know you've got six variables
and six equations, you know,

623
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,820
so you can all solve them. But there's
so many, it seems too complicated.

624
00:38:53,821 --> 00:38:56,280
But now you've got rid of one equation,
one variable.

625
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:59,040
We can also get rid of one equation.
He says,

626
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:01,080
so how can you get rid of one equation?

627
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:04,650
Well suppose we clear the x market,

628
00:39:04,651 --> 00:39:08,760
we found x say and what we find x say x,

629
00:39:08,761 --> 00:39:13,761
B y a am y B and the two and Px and p y
and all the equations are satisfied one

630
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:17,830
through five but we, all these
equations are satisfied. Um,

631
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,110
one three, four, five and
six were all satisfied.

632
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,100
We haven't checked equation too though,

633
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:28,860
whether that market is going to clear and
Varo said, well it has to clear. Okay,

634
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:33,060
the last equation, the last, uh,
market, we don't need to worry about.

635
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,250
Why is that?
Because

636
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:40,050
if x say plus x B equals ea plus Eeb,

637
00:39:40,051 --> 00:39:44,310
that means collectively all the
agents are spending on good acts.

638
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:48,210
Exactly all the money that they're
collected. We getting by selling good ex.

639
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,330
Okay.
That's what the top equation says.

640
00:39:51,331 --> 00:39:53,730
Cause you knew multiply
through the whole thing by Px.

641
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:56,850
The total amount of people are spending
on good acts as equal to the total

642
00:39:56,851 --> 00:39:59,520
amount agents are getting by
selling all the good acts.

643
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,580
So since everybody's
spending all their money,

644
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,690
that must mean the rest of their money
collectively is just all their money

645
00:40:06,691 --> 00:40:08,130
they're getting from selling good.

646
00:40:08,131 --> 00:40:12,030
Why they must be spending it all
collectively on buying good. Why?

647
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,100
Okay. So that means the next
equation automatically has
to hold because everybody

648
00:40:17,101 --> 00:40:18,240
spent all his money.

649
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,290
So therefore all the money collectively
that was spent on good x equals to the

650
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:26,910
what's purchased of good acts. Because
supply equals demand for what? X so good.

651
00:40:26,911 --> 00:40:28,680
Why?
It has to be that all the people,

652
00:40:28,681 --> 00:40:30,360
the income of their
getting on spending good,

653
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:35,220
why all of that was spent on buying.
Why collectively, not any person,

654
00:40:35,221 --> 00:40:37,830
each person and you know,
selling why and buying x or something.

655
00:40:37,831 --> 00:40:41,880
But collectively all the money we've
just to do spent on why I had to go to

656
00:40:41,881 --> 00:40:44,430
buying. Why. So therefore the
why market is clearing too.

657
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,560
So once you've cleared
all the other markets,

658
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:50,350
you know that the last
market has to clear. So, um,

659
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:54,390
without loss of generality,
don't worry about last market.

660
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:55,323
Okay?

661
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:01,600
Okay. So that reduced it to five equations
and five unknowns. So that helped.

662
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:05,230
We got rid of one equation and
we got rid of one on known.

663
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,930
So we got rid of the
top equation let's say,

664
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:12,040
and the F and p x where we got rid of,
you know, one of those two equations.

665
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:14,320
The market clearing
equations doesn't matter.

666
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,360
As long as we can do all the others and
we one of the prices, we can fix it one.

667
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,320
So then the next step was,
um,

668
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:27,160
since we can fix p y let's say at one,
why is it was fixed p y at one,

669
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:31,060
this becomes a much simpler equation.
This now I can replace with one,

670
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,130
and this I can replace with one.
We already know

671
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,850
what the price is of,
of why it's one. Okay.

672
00:41:37,851 --> 00:41:39,440
But now things get very,

673
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:44,420
very simple because you have a hundred
over minus x over px equals one.

674
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:49,380
So I just write that again.
A hundred minus px over PA,

675
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:53,090
a hundred minus x over px equals one.

676
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:56,210
So I bring the Px to the other side,

677
00:41:56,211 --> 00:42:00,710
and I have a hundred minus x equals one X.
Say,

678
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:05,000
okay.
Or to put it in another way equals a px.

679
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,640
Another way of writing that is x,

680
00:42:07,641 --> 00:42:11,690
say equals a hundred minus pex.

681
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:16,640
Okay? And then from this
bottom equation, I've got 30

682
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,420
minus PX,

683
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:25,850
30 minus X, B, sorry, this was equation.

684
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:30,740
These are A's. And this was
B. I forgot the s superscript.

685
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:32,570
So 30 minus X,

686
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:36,770
B over t x has to eat

687
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,010
well.
Um,

688
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,950
well the margin utility is one, and
the price is one. So that equals one.

689
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:48,840
So I just have 30 minus XB equals px.
Or in other words,

690
00:42:48,841 --> 00:42:51,600
I have xb just writing this,

691
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:55,620
bring it to the other
side equals 30 minus x.

692
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:01,450
Okay, so that, that's the, okay. So
you'll look at the demands of all,

693
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:04,220
this is what wall Ross did. He said,
forget about all these equations.

694
00:43:04,221 --> 00:43:07,130
Just look at demand and see more
demand. Equal supplies. So here,

695
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:11,270
given the price px and P why we know
without loss of generality, pis one,

696
00:43:11,271 --> 00:43:15,290
so given Px,
this is how much a is going to demand of x

697
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,700
and given px.
This is how much bs going to demand.

698
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,850
And we know and I call
Librium by that top equation,

699
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,540
that plus that has to equal 84.

700
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:33,460
So now I can solve it.

701
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:38,580
So I know that a hundred
minus p well I'm not gonna,

702
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:42,160
I'm just going to solve it quickly.
So it's 130

703
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:47,860
minus two px equals 84.

704
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:52,360
Once you realize that,
um,

705
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,110
46 two px equals 46,

706
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:02,010
why is it p x equals 23.
Okay.

707
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:04,240
And once you have px equals 23,

708
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:07,720
then you can figure out what x a is.

709
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:13,450
Um, cause 30 minus a hundred
minus x say has to be px.

710
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:16,290
So that implies x.
Say

711
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:22,990
he's 23 and it implies that x B is a s

712
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,333
no,

713
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:31,290
a is 77, right? A hundred minus 20. Oh,

714
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,180
where is x? Say X, say as a
hundred minus px. So px is 23,

715
00:44:36,181 --> 00:44:40,710
x say has to be 77. And implies
that eggs, Xb, I can do eggs,

716
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:45,330
beef from over here, or 30 minus
Px is seven. And sure enough,

717
00:44:45,331 --> 00:44:48,210
77 plus seven really do equal 84.

718
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:53,460
So we've cleared the top market and now
we don't have to worry about the other

719
00:44:53,461 --> 00:44:55,380
market.
We can figure out what X B is.

720
00:44:55,381 --> 00:44:58,080
How do we figure out what x B is
when we go into this budget set,

721
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:03,380
if he's going to add a price of 23 is
going to consume a 77 that's going to cost

722
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:06,540
a bunch of money and this is how much
income he has. And we subtract it off.

723
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:11,070
And P is one, we can figure out what Y is.
Okay? So we could figure out from this,

724
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:12,840
um,

725
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:17,250
eggs be n Y A and why B?

726
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,240
And we know that that's going to clear
the market. So we solved the problem.

727
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,360
Okay.
But we can do this on a computer.

728
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:28,683
MMM.

729
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:31,320
All right.
So there are any questions how I did this?

730
00:45:31,321 --> 00:45:34,740
I'm going to do it one more time with
this model and then I'm going to do it on

731
00:45:34,741 --> 00:45:36,870
a computer. And, uh,

732
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:43,230
so th th this is the kind of problem that
hopefully it will be second nature to

733
00:45:43,231 --> 00:45:47,310
you after you do the problem set. It's
a very elementary thing. Of course,

734
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:49,260
the first time you do it
seems very complicated,

735
00:45:49,261 --> 00:45:50,940
but it's a very mechanical
elementary thing,

736
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:54,570
but it's gonna give us a lot of insight
into the economy. So any questions? Yes,

737
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,920
I was just wondering what those two
lines said. I think the first word,

738
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:03,100
assume this says without loss of
generality, that px equals one.

739
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:04,283
Okay.
Second one.

740
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:08,420
Except that I took p y this
is p why not PXP y equals one

741
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:15,310
and the second line, this one says,
okay, so without loss of generality,

742
00:46:15,311 --> 00:46:19,330
p why is one,
so having put p y equal to one here,

743
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:22,150
I then looked at these equations,
a hundred minus x,

744
00:46:22,151 --> 00:46:27,151
say over px equals one over
p y but I took p y to be one.

745
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:30,490
So that's one over one, which is
one. And I took this equation,

746
00:46:30,491 --> 00:46:35,020
which is 30 minus xb over
px equals one over p y.

747
00:46:35,021 --> 00:46:39,670
So 30 minus XB over px
equals one over p y.

748
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:42,010
But that's one of her one,
which is one. So I wrote that.

749
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:47,250
So this is how I got my two
critical equations. Hey,

750
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:49,320
these two equations here,

751
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:54,350
this and that went down to this and then
I just rewrote this one is x say is a

752
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:00,510
hundred minus px and this one you
can write as Xb is 30 minus px.

753
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:03,220
So 100 minus Px,
30 minus px.

754
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:08,270
And then I add an x eight XP and I got
130 minus two px equals 84 and I got px.

755
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:14,010
Yup. So we can set any number, any number.

756
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:18,420
Yes. You'll just multiply the
prices. If you said p y to be too,

757
00:47:18,421 --> 00:47:21,990
you'd gotten px to be 46
and you get the same answer

758
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:24,543
relative.

759
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,290
So the only thing that
matters is relative prices.

760
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:31,990
So this is what vol Ross pointed out.
If you know you change dollars to cents,

761
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:33,130
you're going to change.

762
00:47:33,131 --> 00:47:36,130
You're going to multiply every price
by a hundred but the relative price of

763
00:47:36,131 --> 00:47:38,800
oranges and tomatoes is going
to be the same as it was before.

764
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:42,610
So the theory only
produces relative prices.

765
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,630
Any other questions or someone else
raising their hand? Nope. All right,

766
00:47:48,631 --> 00:47:50,430
let's just do it one more time.
So you see,

767
00:47:50,431 --> 00:47:53,130
you get the hang of this and then we're
going to talk about why the market's so

768
00:47:53,131 --> 00:47:56,100
good and we're going to see things are
getting a little bit more complicated.

769
00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:00,720
Okay? So let's do this one.

770
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,660
This one is going to work.

771
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,120
Oh,
so I wasn't very clever here.

772
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:11,900
Uh Huh.

773
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:17,500
Oh maybe I couldn't be clever.
More clever. Okay. Okay.

774
00:48:17,501 --> 00:48:20,650
So how do we do this one? Well, we
have to write down all the equations.

775
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:25,580
So what are they going to
be? They're going to be the
same as before. X a plus X,

776
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:30,220
B equals e,
a x plus e,

777
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:33,190
bx pay that supply and demand.

778
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:37,240
But this is just two
plus one equals three.

779
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:41,920
And over here we have, it's not
a and B anymore. It's C and D,

780
00:48:41,921 --> 00:48:44,110
I guess I called them c and d.

781
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,090
Okay. And now we have
for, for the second one,

782
00:48:50,091 --> 00:48:55,091
we have x at y c plus Y,

783
00:48:55,401 --> 00:48:58,310
d e equals e c.

784
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:03,360
Why listen downwind of c of d of y
equals one plus two equals three,

785
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:12,680
right? So that's supply and demand.
Then we have to do the budget sats.

786
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,890
They're going to be simple p x times x,

787
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:22,340
c Plus p y times y c has to equal
p x times two plus p y times one,

788
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:31,820
right?

789
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:36,660
And then budget set for D is p x times x,

790
00:49:36,661 --> 00:49:39,390
d plus p.
Why things?

791
00:49:39,391 --> 00:49:44,370
Why d equals p x times
one plus p y times two.

792
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:49,050
Okay? And finally we have
to do the marginal business.

793
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:52,020
So what's the marginal business?
So somebody tell me this.

794
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,420
So we need the margin utility

795
00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:01,620
of a a,
okay.

796
00:50:01,621 --> 00:50:04,170
Over the price of x.
What's that?

797
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,560
What's the margin utility of x to Mr a

798
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:15,260
three over four. What?
Okay, that's what you said.

799
00:50:15,261 --> 00:50:19,580
Three or four acts exactly divided by Px.
Okay?

800
00:50:19,581 --> 00:50:22,220
So how did I do that? I took the
derivative of three quarters times.

801
00:50:22,221 --> 00:50:23,720
Log Axis is the only
thing you have to know.

802
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:28,010
All the derivative log acts is one over
x, okay? And that's going to equal to,

803
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:29,120
um,

804
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:34,120
the margin utility of x a y a with respect
to why over p y and that's equal to

805
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:41,684
what?

806
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:45,310
One of our four,
hold on,

807
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,390
we'll have a for why we're here.

808
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:54,640
Yes, my A's are sees. Thank you.
I'm glad you pointed that out. Um,

809
00:50:56,710 --> 00:51:00,640
thanks. So you know, it's embarrassing
to make all these mistakes,

810
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:03,460
but you'll find in 30 years you'll
start making mistakes too. Anyway,

811
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:08,260
so here we go. So, um, okay,
so that's that equation.

812
00:51:08,261 --> 00:51:11,890
And then we have to do the same thing
for y and I should have been more clever

813
00:51:11,891 --> 00:51:13,750
and left more room, but
I didn't. But anyway,

814
00:51:13,751 --> 00:51:17,500
the last equation is going to be margin.
Yeah. So what is the last equation?

815
00:51:17,501 --> 00:51:18,410
Let's just,
okay.

816
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:23,420
Margin utility of d a x
divided by p x equals what?

817
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:30,883
Okay.

818
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:36,180
Two thirds times one
override divided by px equals

819
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,513
right.

820
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:43,970
Equals what? Margin until equals.
I'm not going to write out margin.

821
00:51:43,971 --> 00:51:46,730
Utility of y divided by p.
Why is what?

822
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:50,650
Why d

823
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:52,343
okay.

824
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:56,260
Divided by p y. Okay, so
those are the equations.

825
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:58,870
So now we're going to
put these on a computer,

826
00:51:58,871 --> 00:52:03,280
but we can solve these by hand again and
we're going to see it's very useful to

827
00:52:03,281 --> 00:52:04,210
be able to do this

828
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:10,953
almost.

829
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:17,140
Okay? So let's, uh, okay, so what,
there's another trick to doing this.

830
00:52:17,141 --> 00:52:21,580
So the trick is, okay, we can
trake p one of them to be won,

831
00:52:21,581 --> 00:52:22,900
whichever we want to do.

832
00:52:22,901 --> 00:52:27,130
Take p y to be one or Px to be one.

833
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:30,670
So take p x equal one.

834
00:52:30,671 --> 00:52:33,760
Here you see things are a
little bit more symmetric there.

835
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:37,210
There was the special why that
had constant margin utility.

836
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:39,610
Just like in our football
tickets example here,

837
00:52:39,611 --> 00:52:41,090
there's nothing that has constant margin.

838
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:43,180
Utility x and y are much more symmetric.

839
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:48,100
So this move to more symmetry without
the special acts is very important.

840
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:51,780
And the guy who first did that was
actually Irving Fisher at Yale.

841
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:53,710
You're gonna hear a lot about very soon.

842
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:58,390
So it's a little bit more complicated
this time. So what is the, uh,

843
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:03,250
okay, so here's the critical
equation. This one, let's say,

844
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,450
okay, so now I'm going
to solve this. Okay?

845
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:12,830
So I just, so how can I do this? I want,

846
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:16,610
I want to do the same trick
is before I now want to solve.

847
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:21,260
So let's take p to be one like
I did before, apy to be one.

848
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:25,980
Okay? So let's just solve
this equation. Solve for x. So

849
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:29,820
how can we,
it's not gonna be so easy to do this.

850
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:31,223
MMM.

851
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:40,110
Okay. So now there's a tremendous
trick here. What does this say?

852
00:53:40,111 --> 00:53:42,150
If I rewrite this, it says, yes,

853
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:43,143
mmm,

854
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:53,330
I can bring the x down here
and I get Px Times X. Okay?

855
00:53:53,331 --> 00:53:57,320
And I can bring the white down
here and I get p y times y.

856
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:03,190
So it says that the amount you spend on
x relative to three quarters is equal to

857
00:54:03,651 --> 00:54:05,900
the amount. This is,
by the way, Mister, uh,

858
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:10,550
see the amounts see spends on x relative
to three quarters is equal to the

859
00:54:10,551 --> 00:54:15,410
amount he spends on why?
Relative to one quarter. Okay?

860
00:54:15,411 --> 00:54:20,120
But the total spending on x and
y has gotta be all his income.

861
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:25,250
So basically it says that he spends
three quarters was income on x and one

862
00:54:25,251 --> 00:54:28,700
quarter on why? That's
the crucial insight. Okay.

863
00:54:28,701 --> 00:54:33,590
So that you can solve these logarithmic
examples very easily by that trick.

864
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:37,820
Okay? So it's evident, evident

865
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:43,850
from margin utility equation

866
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,980
that C,
we'll spend

867
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:53,210
three quarters of his income

868
00:54:55,930 --> 00:55:00,640
on x and D we'll spend

869
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,470
two thirds of her income

870
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:12,250
on x by the same argument. She's going
to have two thirds, you know, look,

871
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:17,360
I can bring XD down and she's gonna
spend her spending on x relative to two

872
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:21,630
thirds is equal to her spending
on why relative to one third,

873
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:25,650
but she's spending all her income
on x and y. So clearly, you know,

874
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,610
two thirds of it is being spent on
x and one third of it on why. Okay.

875
00:55:29,611 --> 00:55:34,611
So that property of the
log utilities is no eggs,

876
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,830
no accident. They were invented
for exactly that purpose.

877
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:42,240
So it was a story you probably heard, but
there is a famous, uh, I'm from Illinois.

878
00:55:42,241 --> 00:55:45,120
There was a famous, uh,
Senator Douglas from Illinois,

879
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:50,070
been several Douglas's from Illinois.
Um, one of them debate in Lincoln.

880
00:55:50,071 --> 00:55:51,690
But anyway,
there's a famous,

881
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,690
maybe it wasn't familiar to me and
there was a famous senator from Lincoln,

882
00:55:54,691 --> 00:55:55,291
was really where I am.

883
00:55:55,291 --> 00:55:58,560
There's a famous senator named Douglas
from Illinois after the civil war.

884
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:01,410
And he noticed that, you know, farmers,

885
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:06,570
you labor tended to get two thirds to
three quarters of all the income and

886
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,670
capital the rest.
So he said,

887
00:56:08,671 --> 00:56:12,660
what kind of utility function would make
me always spend the same fraction of

888
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:16,020
wine money on a particular good.
And so he went to his,

889
00:56:16,021 --> 00:56:20,010
a college math teacher calm and uh,

890
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:23,380
asked him if he could invent any utility
function which had the property that

891
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:24,214
you always spent

892
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,980
a fixed proportion of
your money on each good.

893
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:31,080
And so Cobb invented the Cobb Douglas
Utility function. And this is where it is,

894
00:56:31,081 --> 00:56:34,450
is just the sum of a logs.
Okay.

895
00:56:34,451 --> 00:56:38,980
So it's called Cobb Douglas Utility.
So it has that property,

896
00:56:38,981 --> 00:56:41,330
this property that each
person who is Cobb, Doug,

897
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:45,360
US utility spends a fixed proportion
of her money on each of the goods,

898
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:47,320
a different proportion
on each of the goods.

899
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,180
And different people have
different proportions,

900
00:56:49,181 --> 00:56:52,390
but any single person is going to
always spend a given proportion.

901
00:56:52,391 --> 00:56:56,410
Three quarters on acts one quarter on
why two thirds on x one quarter and why?

902
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:59,800
And because of that,
it's very easy to solve for equilibrium.

903
00:56:59,801 --> 00:57:04,180
So we go x say is going to be
three quarters. What is her income?

904
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:10,020
Her income is px times
two plus p y times one.

905
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:12,460
Okay.

906
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:16,330
Okay. And, and, and her, okay.

907
00:57:16,331 --> 00:57:19,970
So that's her income has to be that
she's going to send three quarters for

908
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:21,130
income annex.

909
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:25,690
So I could write essays
that and meanwhile eggs.

910
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:30,700
So this is c and XD is going to be,
he's,

911
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:34,750
she's spending two thirds of her income on

912
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,513
x

913
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,120
and um,
one third on why.

914
00:57:43,121 --> 00:57:47,560
So her spouse, her endowments are
one unit of x and two units of y.

915
00:57:47,561 --> 00:57:51,010
So this is her income px
times one plus p y times too.

916
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:53,920
And so she's spending
two thirds of it on x.

917
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:58,630
So therefore px times XD, that's
the amount of money she spends on x.

918
00:57:58,631 --> 00:58:02,080
That's what she spends. An axe
has to be that. So XD is that,

919
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:07,090
and if I add these two, okay, I
have to get, when I add them up,

920
00:58:07,091 --> 00:58:11,260
I have to get two plus one equals three.
Okay.

921
00:58:11,261 --> 00:58:14,140
So I can just now solve this.
Okay,

922
00:58:14,141 --> 00:58:19,141
well I can do a trick and pick one
of my either p extra p y to be one.

923
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:22,690
So either one, I keep going back and
forth. It doesn't make any difference.

924
00:58:22,691 --> 00:58:27,691
Let's try p why is one can take
that to be one and I can solve it.

925
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:33,271
So this is just three quarters
times p x times two plus one

926
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,380
probably. Anyway, it doesn't
matter. It divided by Px.

927
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:48,990
Um,
okay.

928
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:54,050
And then the other one is two thirds px
times one plus two eight divided by Px.

929
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:05,070
So I can add those. Okay. And it has to
equal when I add those and equals three.

930
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:10,530
So I know that three Px,
if I multiply through by Px,

931
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,520
I get three px equals three halves.

932
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,130
Hopefully I did this right.
Three ass x,

933
00:59:18,131 --> 00:59:19,650
this will be very
embarrassing if I didn't.

934
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:24,980
Three FPX plus three
quarters plus two thirds px,

935
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:28,813
um,

936
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,080
plus four thirds equals three px.

937
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:36,980
Oh,
is this right?

938
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:44,900
So who can do this in their heads? Three
halves. Px from that is three halves.

939
00:59:44,901 --> 00:59:48,320
Px. So three halves. Wine is two thirds.

940
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:53,540
Three halves is nine.
Six minus four.

941
00:59:53,541 --> 00:59:58,110
Six is five. Six it looks
like five, six px. Hey,

942
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,350
does anyone believe that if
I do this in terms of a six,

943
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:04,880
that's nine sixth,

944
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:09,680
nine over six and that's a four over six.

945
01:00:09,681 --> 01:00:12,890
That's 13 over six and that's 18 over six.

946
01:00:12,891 --> 01:00:17,360
So it's five over six px that looks right
and three quarters plus four thirds.

947
01:00:17,361 --> 01:00:20,030
If I go to twelves,
that's a nine.

948
01:00:20,031 --> 01:00:24,290
12 and 16.
12 is 25 twelves

949
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:29,840
so this looks like, um, five has,

950
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,200
okay, so px. Sorry.

951
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:38,330
So that means px equals five halves.
Okay,

952
01:00:38,331 --> 01:00:39,560
so there I've got the answer.

953
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,233
Okay.

954
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:47,020
Does that look right to you?
Okay.

955
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:50,490
Is this clear? What I did here?
I just took for this trick,

956
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:53,040
all I did was I solve for,

957
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:01,600
okay, so let's just repeat what
I did. Just like over there.

958
01:01:01,601 --> 01:01:05,650
I reduced it to simultaneous equations
in a mechanical way, in a very simple,

959
01:01:05,651 --> 01:01:06,850
straightforward mechanical way,

960
01:01:06,851 --> 01:01:11,470
which the first time you see it looks
very complicated. But uh, it's, you know,

961
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,490
it's very simple.

962
01:01:12,491 --> 01:01:16,030
In fact after you've done it once and
then it allows you to take these very

963
01:01:16,031 --> 01:01:20,020
complicated models and say
something concrete. So I've
got all the peoples there,

964
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:22,330
their welfare functions
and their endowments.

965
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,740
So I say an equilibrium was what has
to happen. Whatever they decide to eat.

966
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:30,220
C And d, what he eats plus what
she eats has to be the endowment.

967
01:01:30,221 --> 01:01:34,390
The total endowment is three. So the
total consumption of access to be three,

968
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:38,470
the total consumption of y between when
he eats and what she eats also has to be

969
01:01:38,471 --> 01:01:41,980
three. Okay. Now each of them is
going to spend all their money.

970
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,510
He's going to spend all his money,

971
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:47,410
she's going to spend all her money
because it's carb Douglas because it's

972
01:01:47,411 --> 01:01:52,060
logarithmic and you do this margin
utility stuff. You find out,

973
01:01:52,061 --> 01:01:55,210
and this was the only trick. So this
is a non obvious trek, you know,

974
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,410
which some senator and a uh,

975
01:01:57,470 --> 01:02:01,020
a professional mathematician
had to invent Cobb dog.

976
01:02:01,021 --> 01:02:06,021
This is designed so that you can say
right away with those utility functions,

977
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:11,310
d is clearly going to spend two thirds
of her money buying x and C is going to

978
01:02:11,741 --> 01:02:16,741
spend three quarters of his money buying
x as just obvious from the first order

979
01:02:17,051 --> 01:02:19,030
conditions from this margin utility.

980
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:22,710
They're called first door to conditions
from this equating margin utilities.

981
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,680
That was the crucial
trick. Okay, so that's one.

982
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:29,160
So that's a trick that you have to
internalize and you know from now on,

983
01:02:29,161 --> 01:02:33,690
that's all you have to know that sees
going to spend three quarters of his money

984
01:02:33,691 --> 01:02:37,740
on x one quarter of his money on why and
going to spend two thirds of her money

985
01:02:37,741 --> 01:02:42,180
on acts and one third on y, but supply
to equal demand. So what is, see,

986
01:02:42,181 --> 01:02:45,840
what is he actually buying?
Here's his total money he gets,

987
01:02:45,841 --> 01:02:47,550
he has two units of x and one unit of y.

988
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:52,440
So he's selling his units of acts at the
price px and engineers of why the price

989
01:02:52,441 --> 01:02:54,780
p y and you spending three
quarters of an annex,

990
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:57,600
so how much excess he actually buying.

991
01:02:57,601 --> 01:03:01,860
This is the amount of money he spending
on x divided by the price of Px.

992
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:05,100
That's how much money he buys of ex.

993
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:08,910
She d she's going to spend,
here's her income,

994
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:11,790
which is not quite the same as his cause.
Their endowments different.

995
01:03:11,791 --> 01:03:15,660
That's her income.
She spends two thirds of it on x,

996
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,800
so the amount of x she wants to buy is
the amount of money she spends on it

997
01:03:19,801 --> 01:03:22,290
divided by the price.
That's how much she wants to buy.

998
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:25,500
Now I just have to add x c plus XD.

999
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:30,150
It's very hard for me to do at
the board and you to follow there,

1000
01:03:30,151 --> 01:03:33,720
but of course if you'll stare at the
page for a minute, it's you know,

1001
01:03:33,721 --> 01:03:38,220
at home it will be very simple to follow.
I do another, I do vall Ross's trick.

1002
01:03:38,221 --> 01:03:42,870
I said I can always take PYP to be
one. Okay. If I take p to be one,

1003
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:48,030
I'm going to get this income is px two
times one times one, which is just one.

1004
01:03:48,031 --> 01:03:51,090
So three quarters of this divided by Px,
that's what he's buying.

1005
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:56,100
She's buying two thirds of her income,
which is px times one plus one times two,

1006
01:03:56,101 --> 01:03:59,700
which is plus two divided by p access.
What she's buying.

1007
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:03,960
And I just add this to this
and do a little Algebra, okay?

1008
01:04:03,961 --> 01:04:07,320
So I just add and do a little
Algebra and lo and behold,

1009
01:04:07,321 --> 01:04:10,590
px is equal to five halves. So I happened
to remember that's the right number.

1010
01:04:10,591 --> 01:04:14,820
So I actually did this right? So
px is equal to five halves, okay?

1011
01:04:14,821 --> 01:04:17,910
And we solved the whole problem.
So of Px is equal to five halves.

1012
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:21,120
How much is she actually,
um,

1013
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:24,420
how much is she actually buying of x?

1014
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,300
Well,
I could always plug this back in.

1015
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:34,450
Plug in Px is equal to five halves and
find out that's five plus one is six.

1016
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:38,030
You know, times three quarters,
divide by five halves.

1017
01:04:38,031 --> 01:04:41,690
That would tell me how much x
she see she was buying. Okay?

1018
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:46,720
So and I could plug in five halves
for Pex and I'd get how much XD,

1019
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:51,790
how much Dee was buying a vax and I could
also plug px equal to five halves and

1020
01:04:52,461 --> 01:04:56,600
p y equal to one and find out
what they were doing of good d.

1021
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,450
Okay.
So you can solve it by hand very easily.

1022
01:04:59,451 --> 01:05:04,040
But let's just solve it by computer
instead unless there's a question. Huh?

1023
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:08,000
I stopped it. Any questions
about what I did here? Yes.

1024
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:18,280
Okay. Well now we haven't gotten
here yet. Now we're going to we,

1025
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:19,390
so I'm obviously not,

1026
01:05:19,391 --> 01:05:22,380
I run over a little bit so I'm going
to finish the class by doing this,

1027
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:26,200
repeating this calculation on a computer
just by pressing a button and you'll

1028
01:05:26,201 --> 01:05:28,870
see what the answer is. Okay. Uh,

1029
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:34,060
but then we have to examine the question.
Have we really maximized utility here?

1030
01:05:34,061 --> 01:05:38,200
And to give away the punchline
that utility was very special.

1031
01:05:38,201 --> 01:05:41,980
It was constant margin utility
of one and a particular good y.

1032
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:46,270
That's what made this example is almost
identical to the football ticket example.

1033
01:05:46,271 --> 01:05:51,130
The final equilibrium's going to
maximize the sum of utilities here.

1034
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:54,310
This equilibrium is not going to
maximize the sum of utilities.

1035
01:05:54,311 --> 01:05:57,130
There's no reason it should
maximize the sum of utilities.

1036
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:01,570
And so you need a different definition
of why the free market is such a good

1037
01:06:01,571 --> 01:06:04,360
thing.
So economists made a tremendous mistake.

1038
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:08,560
They thought that the original criteria
and for a good market is you maximize

1039
01:06:08,561 --> 01:06:13,000
the sum of utilities. That's not even
true in an example like this one.

1040
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:16,420
So we need a different definition,
which we call parade. Oh, efficiency.

1041
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:19,000
That that illustrates
why the market's good,

1042
01:06:19,001 --> 01:06:22,600
but if they made an economy will mistake
once stands to reason they could make a

1043
01:06:22,601 --> 01:06:26,080
mistake another time. So there's something
special. Even about this example,

1044
01:06:26,081 --> 01:06:27,820
when we put in financial variables,

1045
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:31,780
I'm going to argue you shouldn't expect
to get the optimal outcome all the time,

1046
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:34,360
but that will be next class.
Yes,

1047
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:40,350
like arithmetic.
Is there any reasons you choose to assume?

1048
01:06:40,890 --> 01:06:41,760
Yeah,

1049
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:48,000
no. There's no reason to pick px or p
y to be one, whichever one you want.

1050
01:06:48,001 --> 01:06:50,100
You can choose to be one,
and I keep going.

1051
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:53,430
I can never make up my mind
which one to do. So yeah,

1052
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,470
just whatever works out this one,

1053
01:06:55,471 --> 01:06:57,810
it clearly worked out
arithmetically easy to take.

1054
01:06:57,811 --> 01:07:01,770
P Y go to one because the marginal utility
of why it was one and that canceled

1055
01:07:01,771 --> 01:07:02,970
everything out here.

1056
01:07:02,971 --> 01:07:06,420
I could have taken either one price
to be one and wouldn't have helped.

1057
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:10,890
So I picked p why did we want again?
Okay,

1058
01:07:10,891 --> 01:07:12,810
so let's just in the last five minutes,

1059
01:07:12,811 --> 01:07:16,530
let's just soft show how to
solve this by computer. Um,

1060
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:20,070
and so this is something you also are
going to be able to do. And you know,

1061
01:07:20,071 --> 01:07:23,310
it sounds like, oh, there's so many
complicated things. Is this new equations,

1062
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:26,220
you know, it's, you do
this for the problem set,

1063
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,230
it will after you've done
it once for the problem.

1064
01:07:28,231 --> 01:07:31,320
So you may have a little trouble with
the problem set, the TA's will help you,

1065
01:07:31,321 --> 01:07:34,020
but after you do at once,
this will be very simple.

1066
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:38,700
Now doing a bike computer is also
very simple and it's going to sound

1067
01:07:38,701 --> 01:07:41,820
complicated, but you know,
as all you young people, no,

1068
01:07:41,821 --> 01:07:45,000
if any old guy can figure
out how to work a computer,

1069
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:49,440
you can do it vastly quicker. So let's
just take the second example here.

1070
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:59,550
Okay. And, and we have five minutes left.
That's all it will take. So this is an XL.

1071
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:03,540
Now Xcel is this program that's
made zillions of dollars.

1072
01:08:03,541 --> 01:08:06,600
The inventor of XL, by the way, um,

1073
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:11,640
was the inventor of Lotus. Uh,
oh, what was the guy's name?

1074
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:16,650
Um, his sister was in my class at
Yale. He was two ahead of me. Go,

1075
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:21,500
go, go. Uh, not Gabor,
Mitch, Mitch, Mitch, Gabor,

1076
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:23,360
something like that was his name.
Anyway,

1077
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:26,870
she was in my class and he was two years
ahead of me and he invented this thing

1078
01:08:26,871 --> 01:08:29,990
called Lotus, which made
a lot of money. And uh,

1079
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:34,220
then it got bought out by a few people
and then Xcel just basically, you know,

1080
01:08:34,221 --> 01:08:39,170
copied the entire thing and a Microsoft
and made a fortune and had to pay him

1081
01:08:39,171 --> 01:08:42,890
off for plagiarizing the thing. But
anyway, it's, it's basically Mitch.

1082
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:46,820
Gabor was the inventor and
a Yale undergraduate. Okay.
Two years ahead of me.

1083
01:08:46,821 --> 01:08:51,590
So he made, you know, he's a billionaire
now, so let's just solve the problem.

1084
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:54,080
Let's do the second one says,
I may not have time for the first one.

1085
01:08:54,081 --> 01:08:58,460
So what did I do? I said let's write down
the exogenous variables first. Sorry,

1086
01:08:58,461 --> 01:09:00,080
let's go up.
Okay,

1087
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:05,350
so the exogenous variables are the
endowment of x of the two goods a and B.

1088
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:07,470
That's two and one. Okay. And I've,

1089
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:11,870
I've bee is wanting to now what
are the variables? Px, p y x,

1090
01:09:11,871 --> 01:09:16,580
a y a XP and my be, we don't know what
those are. So I've plugged in, you know,

1091
01:09:16,581 --> 01:09:20,480
Px and p y I'll gas. Both of them are
one, which is obviously going to be wrong.

1092
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:23,240
And I'll guess that people just
end up with their endowments,

1093
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:27,710
which is obviously not right.
Okay. So then I look at the
budget set. So the, okay,

1094
01:09:27,711 --> 01:09:29,420
so those are my guesses for the,

1095
01:09:29,421 --> 01:09:32,810
these are the endogenous variables
and wild guesses about the solution.

1096
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:37,040
Now what are the equations where we wrote
them down? There's the budget set of a,

1097
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:41,270
so that's just the budget set of a,
so how do you write these equations down?

1098
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:44,870
Okay. You simply name the, it's up here.

1099
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,150
If you haven't used excel before,
up here,

1100
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:52,330
you write down the
letter C B 35 that's px.

1101
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:53,900
So be 35 times,

1102
01:09:53,901 --> 01:09:58,901
be 31 that's P X is be
35 times endowment X.

1103
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:04,100
Say that's the, that's the
income I wrote the income first,

1104
01:10:04,101 --> 01:10:09,101
that's the income a has minus how much
she spends or he spends be 35 times 37 B

1105
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:15,260
35 remembers the price of XP.
37 is how much a he buys. Okay?

1106
01:10:15,261 --> 01:10:17,870
So that's just the budget sense.
So for each of these equations,

1107
01:10:17,871 --> 01:10:19,940
the margin utility,
I just did the same thing.

1108
01:10:19,941 --> 01:10:24,941
Remember the three quarters over px
times x and w you know equals one quarter

1109
01:10:25,281 --> 01:10:27,620
times p y times y.
So this should be equal to zero.

1110
01:10:27,621 --> 01:10:32,450
All these equations are I instead of
saying this equals that I subtract the

1111
01:10:32,451 --> 01:10:34,160
right hand side from the left hand side.

1112
01:10:34,161 --> 01:10:36,560
So you want all these
equations to be equal to zero.

1113
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:41,150
I just wrote down the sick six equations.
Okay?

1114
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:46,070
And so XL now tells me, you
know, the, of course the budget,

1115
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:49,160
the budget's set is going to be satisfied
automatically because people are

1116
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:53,210
consuming their endowments
and the budget's set of bees
automatically satisfied.

1117
01:10:53,211 --> 01:10:55,280
Cause I've just had them
choosing their endowments.

1118
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,080
And markets are going to clear of course,

1119
01:10:57,081 --> 01:10:59,930
cause everybody's choosing their
endowments but they're not optimizing.

1120
01:10:59,931 --> 01:11:03,380
So the first order this a margin
utility stuff is all screwed up.

1121
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:07,010
So what do I do on the right
for every error in the equation,

1122
01:11:07,011 --> 01:11:11,450
I square it so I've squared all the
errors. Okay? So these are my equations.

1123
01:11:11,451 --> 01:11:16,260
I need to satisfy one, two, four, five,
six equations, one, two, three, four,

1124
01:11:16,261 --> 01:11:19,380
five, six and I some the squares. Okay.

1125
01:11:19,381 --> 01:11:23,130
So if I make the sum of the squares zero,
each of those has to be zero.

1126
01:11:23,131 --> 01:11:26,130
So Xcel now can minimize
the sum of squared errors.

1127
01:11:26,430 --> 01:11:29,820
Xcel is going to search over
all indogenous variables,

1128
01:11:29,821 --> 01:11:34,821
px through y B to find the things that
makes this number of smallest possible.

1129
01:11:35,641 --> 01:11:39,150
Once this number becomes zero means
all the ones above it have to be zero

1130
01:11:39,151 --> 01:11:41,250
because they're all squared numbers.
Adding up to that.

1131
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:46,020
And so I will found a solution.
So you see that all you have to do,

1132
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,110
if you've done this before, of course
it's obvious. If you haven't, you know,

1133
01:11:49,111 --> 01:11:54,090
it's just so simple to write the equation,
supplying demands. I just mean the box,

1134
01:11:54,330 --> 01:11:58,590
you know, be, you know,
I'll be 32. That's just uh,

1135
01:11:58,890 --> 01:11:59,341
you know,

1136
01:11:59,341 --> 01:12:04,170
that's the endowment of why a plus the
endowment of a y B equals the consumption

1137
01:12:04,171 --> 01:12:08,670
of, of a a plus the consumption
of me. That's the difference.
We want to make. Zero,

1138
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:13,470
okay, so here, here's how you solve
it. There's a thing called solver.

1139
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:18,840
So you go to tools and you hit
solver and now solve, says,

1140
01:12:18,841 --> 01:12:23,820
okay, you want to take a target
cell? I cheated. I already
knew what it was. See 47.

1141
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:27,990
So it's the target cell. I hit
minimize. So I want to minimize that.

1142
01:12:27,991 --> 01:12:30,810
And now what cells do I change?
Well,

1143
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:35,670
I have to tell excel what the search over.
So now Xcel,

1144
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:39,630
what are the, what are the
cells? I could say PXP you know,

1145
01:12:39,631 --> 01:12:44,100
all the indigenous variables, but I
know I can fix px. To be one. Okay.

1146
01:12:44,101 --> 01:12:48,750
So I'm going to forget that one. And
I'm going to say just these five, right?

1147
01:12:48,751 --> 01:12:52,680
I don't need all six of them. Just five
cause I can always take px to be one.

1148
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,200
Okay? So active, the solver now knows
it wants to minimize this number,

1149
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:02,820
which is the air, the squared errors of
all the equations I want to hold equal.

1150
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:05,910
It's going to minimize that by
searching over all those numbers.

1151
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:08,490
It's not very smart
about searching for it.

1152
01:13:08,491 --> 01:13:12,940
And sometimes it never finds an answer.
We know there always is an answer. And uh,

1153
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:17,040
so how do you solve it? You just hit
Sov and it's going to search and do it.

1154
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:22,020
And what should the answer be?
If I fix px to be one.

1155
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:26,790
Okay. Remember the answer was when p why
is one extra is out to be five halves.

1156
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:30,120
If I fix px to be one,
what should be why B?

1157
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:36,280
The solution we got before was
px equals five halves and p.

1158
01:13:36,281 --> 01:13:40,340
Why is one now I'm going to fix px
to be one. So what should, why B

1159
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:44,360
x was five halves times.
Why?

1160
01:13:44,361 --> 01:13:47,540
So why should be 0.4 so
if this solves right,

1161
01:13:47,541 --> 01:13:49,700
we should get y p y to be point for us,

1162
01:13:49,701 --> 01:13:54,160
I just did Saul and Voila,
I get Pete.

1163
01:13:54,161 --> 01:13:58,250
Why to before I find x ne is
1.8 I find all the numbers.

1164
01:13:58,251 --> 01:14:00,980
It's just solve it just
like that instantly. Okay.

1165
01:14:00,981 --> 01:14:05,420
So you can see how useful it's going to
be to use a solver and do these problems

1166
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:10,070
can change. Of course, if
I change the endowments,

1167
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:11,980
I'll get a different answer.
And if I

1168
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,850
increase the endow, yes it
does. And that's very important.

1169
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:21,630
If I double everybody's endowment,

1170
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,500
if I end up with one endowment
that's going to change things around.

1171
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:30,120
If I double everybody's endowment,
it won't change anything. Yeah.
