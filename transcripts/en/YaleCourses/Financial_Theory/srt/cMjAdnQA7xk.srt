1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,180
Dams.
All right.

2
00:00:02,181 --> 00:00:05,480
So I'm going to finish talking
about overlapping generations today.

3
00:00:05,481 --> 00:00:10,481
I'm going to defer my plan to save
social security till a couple of lectures

4
00:00:11,751 --> 00:00:15,500
from now. And I'm going to start to
introduce uncertainty in this class.

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,150
The exam will only cover the stuff
up to basically the last problem set.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,060
So you can, um, uh,

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,890
there are a few things about overlapping
generations I might say today,

8
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,750
which we'll clarify what you already know,

9
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:30,650
but you don't have to know anything beyond
the problem you turned in on Thursday

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,390
on a, you're turning in today. So,

11
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,560
so you I think are better informed
now than you were yesterday.

12
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:41,930
I think it's a big help
to be doing the problems.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,580
So for those of you watching on screen
at home, you know, do the problems.

14
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,880
So the, uh, the,

15
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,780
remember we had a situation where
there were, there were generations,

16
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:58,130
each of whom was rich when young and poor,
when old that looked like that.

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,400
And uh,
and it went on forever.

18
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:03,590
That was the only difference
from what we've had before.

19
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:07,520
People's lives were shorter than the
lifetime of the economy. And to be,

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,100
to go to the extreme,
the economy goes on forever,

21
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:14,690
even though where people only live a two
periods. And then there was land, one,

22
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:19,390
one, one, one. So here's land, here's,

23
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,250
uh, and then there's
generous. Sorry. There's land.

24
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,180
And then there's generation as I forgot
the generation. Here's generation,

25
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:28,460
zero generation,

26
00:01:28,461 --> 00:01:33,200
one generation to generation three.

27
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:36,290
Dot, dot, dot, and time. This is time.

28
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:42,680
And here's time, one time, two
time, three time, four time,

29
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:47,390
five, et cetera. Now this model I've
been told is the hardest thing you do.

30
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:50,780
The entire class, things are going
to get much more complicated.

31
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,520
But since they build up slowly,

32
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,990
I think this model is the hardest thing
that you have to do. The entire class.

33
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,090
I realize it's a little bit confusing,
but in the end,

34
00:01:59,091 --> 00:02:02,240
I don't think it's that
complicated. And it, it, it,

35
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,730
it reveals all of a subtlety
of fishers thinking,

36
00:02:04,731 --> 00:02:08,030
not that Fisher understood about
overlapping generations, but the,

37
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:11,420
his ideas you can see here.
So what are his ideas?

38
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,890
You've got a complicated model in which
you've got people trading apples when

39
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:18,890
they're young, uh, against land. So the,

40
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:21,800
to the objects in the economy,
our land,

41
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:23,840
which are supposed to
think of the stock market.

42
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,313
Okay.

43
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,890
Okay.
So we've got land and we've got um,

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,370
we've got land. Yes. And we've got apples.

45
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,613
So

46
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,580
now what's interesting is the land
is going to constantly change hands.

47
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,000
So the young here are going to buy
the land, but when they get old,

48
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:48,940
they're going to sell the land.
So the land is constantly changing hands.

49
00:02:48,941 --> 00:02:52,720
It's not that one person buys it at
the beginning and holds it forever.

50
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,670
So fishers formula, remember,
was that the price of any asset,

51
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,560
what's it going to be equal
to the, uh, discounted,

52
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,750
discounted dividends.

53
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,490
And the logic seem to be
at the time that the price,

54
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,680
you know,
if the person was going to buy the asset,

55
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:18,560
they could take the money now or they
could wait and get all the dividends in

56
00:03:18,561 --> 00:03:20,420
the future and they would compare,
you know,

57
00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:23,360
what they would get out of the dividends
in the future to what they have to give

58
00:03:23,361 --> 00:03:26,900
up today. But you see in this example,
it's a little more complicated.

59
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:30,500
Nobody's going to hold the land
till and get all the dividends.

60
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,010
Each person who buys the land knows that
he's going to sell it long before the

61
00:03:34,011 --> 00:03:37,850
land of stock, you know, before, before
getting all the dividends from the land.

62
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,840
And yet the price of the land
is still given by this formula.

63
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,610
So we never used the fact in fishers
argument that the same person had to hold

64
00:03:46,611 --> 00:03:47,780
the asset till the end.

65
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,590
And so now we have a case in extreme
case where people only hold the asset for

66
00:03:51,591 --> 00:03:54,560
one period. It's always turning
over, turning over, turning over.

67
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:57,830
But still the price of the asset is
equal to the discounted dividends.

68
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:03,130
So the secret to solving this problem
according to Fisher is forget about the

69
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:06,980
acid that makes it too complicated.
Fisher's argument,

70
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:11,360
again is take financial equilibrium and
arch and write it on a different board

71
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,840
versus argument is financial equilibrium

72
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,940
equity Librium okay,

73
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,380
get rid of acids.
Put dividends into endowment,

74
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,403
okay.

75
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,680
Into an Downlands.

76
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,550
Okay.

77
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,320
And transform it into general,

78
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:39,210
like Librium the very thing you solved
in the first couple days of class. Okay.

79
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,200
And then go backwards and figured out
what the financial equilibrium is.

80
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:48,270
So although it seemed very easy before,
it's a little subtler this time,

81
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:49,710
but it's the same principle.

82
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,660
Who's endowment should you
put the dividends into?

83
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,050
The land is changing hands all the time.
There's a new guy owning it,

84
00:04:58,051 --> 00:04:59,400
a new guy owning it every period.

85
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,460
So who's endowments do we increase when
we put the dividends of the land to the

86
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:08,700
sones and dammit, you put it into the
endowment of the guy who owned it first.

87
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,900
So put dividends into
endowments of original owners.

88
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,030
Okay.

89
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:22,650
So this old person who has
the right to the first apple,

90
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:27,180
his own endowment of an apple,
and also the right to the first dividend,

91
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,420
but he actually has a right to all
the dividends. So his endowment,

92
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,520
the endowment of Mr Zero. Okay.
It's going to be two, one, one, one,

93
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:40,570
etc. Because he is his
original apple plus he's got a,

94
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,523
and

95
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,840
he has this endowment of an apple cause
you know everyone when they're old has

96
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:47,070
an apple.
He's also,

97
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:50,970
because he's on the land before gotten
the right to this first dividend or the

98
00:05:50,971 --> 00:05:54,150
apple that's too. And because
he's the original owner of land,

99
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,070
he owns all the future dividends
streams of the land. Okay?

100
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:02,180
So we can freak out about land after
we've stuck the dividends into the right

101
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:06,080
persons endowment. And now we just
trade as if it's general equilibrium.

102
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,470
We just looked for supply and
demand and the present value prices,

103
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:14,420
which are p one p two p
three, it's Cetera. Okay.

104
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,610
And because it's symmetric,

105
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,880
we know that this is
going to equal one Pete.

106
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:25,220
We can always make one of them be a one.
Price can be one.

107
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,870
So the present value prices are
going to look like this. Okay.

108
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:33,500
And the reason I can make this
simplification is by symmetry. You know,

109
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,870
everything,
every generation is the same.

110
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:41,470
So it's obvious that I'll be able to
keep repeating the same argument over and

111
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:46,460
over again. Okay. And so
what do I have to, okay, so,

112
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,950
so remember the land has disappeared here.

113
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,550
Even though this generation is buying
the land and selling the land in Fisher

114
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:54,590
story,
you don't have to pay attention to that.

115
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,100
This guy bought the land and then
he sold the land so he, you know,

116
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:02,570
it was a fair trade. So he started,
he'd started without an end without it.

117
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:05,210
The fact that in between
use the land to save,

118
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,580
you can already do that
in a general equilibrium.

119
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,760
You don't need to think about the land
because the only reason this guy is

120
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:13,070
buying the land is to use
it for a means of saving,

121
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:14,930
which is already in fishers equations.

122
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:19,850
So to solve for equilibrium
is then quite simple.

123
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,390
We just,
in every generation we look at,

124
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:27,110
and remember I forgot to write
the utility functions. So we have,

125
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:32,111
you have consumption when young and old
is one half log young plus one half log

126
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,880
old.
Okay.

127
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:42,881
And so therefore INACA Librium we have
to have that one half times the income of

128
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,230
every generation.

129
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:49,130
Every generation is going to have
three one young plus one one old.

130
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:54,220
Now from the point of view
of any generation t the
prices are Pete say too when

131
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:56,150
young and p three when old.

132
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,300
Now remember any generation
cares only about relative prices.

133
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,650
So I can call them p two or p three or
I can call them one and p because the

134
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:07,700
ratio is going to be p so much simpler
to think of the prices as one in p.

135
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,010
So the old guy,
okay,

136
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:14,480
if I'm doing any tea like this
period for the old guy here,

137
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,590
you know that's p four and p three he
cares about p three and p four but he only

138
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:21,530
cares about the ratio of p
three and p four which is p.

139
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,860
So from his point of view, he might as
well have thought of them as one in p.

140
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:30,130
So his income is three plus one p and
he's going to spend half his income on

141
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,800
that good.
Which for him as a relative price of p,

142
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,800
the young guys gonna
spend half his income,

143
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,650
which is also three plus one p.

144
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,740
This is the relative price
between t minus one and t.

145
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:46,850
This is the relative price between
t and t plus one but he's now young.

146
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:51,680
So his price when young is one and that
has to equal three plus one plus one

147
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:52,514
equals.

148
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,910
So I wrote it as one plus
three plus one equals five.

149
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,110
Okay.

150
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:03,110
And we solve that and we found
that key equals 0.55 okay.

151
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,370
So there are any questions
about how we did that.

152
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:08,370
That's where we ended the last lecture.
Is that clear to everyone? Yes.

153
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,680
Okay.
If I didn't have symmetry,

154
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,440
I would have to say this is,

155
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,640
I would have to write this as in general,

156
00:09:24,641 --> 00:09:29,641
this would be three p t minus
one plus one PT over PT.

157
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:37,170
And this guy would be three p t plus
one p t plus one divided by P t.

158
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,190
Right. That would be in
general, if I had prices,

159
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:46,690
the present value prices,

160
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:51,870
this guy income would be given by that
because he's the old at time t and the

161
00:09:53,951 --> 00:09:55,360
young would be given by that.

162
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,020
Okay. And I'd have to do this
a new equation for every t.

163
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,303
Okay.

164
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,550
Who asked? You asked the question.
Right? So does that make sense? Okay.

165
00:10:07,551 --> 00:10:09,480
But I have to do that for every single t.

166
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:13,070
So I had an infinite number of prices
and an infinite number of equations.

167
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,910
But then you say right
yourself, well, hmm,

168
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,810
you in all this is if I,
if I replace,

169
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:26,870
if I take the ratio of PT
over p t minus one to equal p,

170
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,640
okay, then the ratio of these two
prices are the same as this price.

171
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,910
And so I've got, um, you know,

172
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,000
I'll have it one equation and one unknown
variable and that same equation will

173
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:45,080
get repeated every other generation
because when I go to generation, you know,

174
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,970
s which is another generation,

175
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,120
all that matters is the ratio between
p t minus one in PT and PTT and p t p t

176
00:10:52,581 --> 00:10:56,990
plus one. So if I, if I,
uh, assume every Genera,

177
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,720
if I assume those ratios
are always the same,

178
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,620
I'm going to be repeating the
same equation over and over again.

179
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,620
So I can solve at once.
I can solve an infinite number of times.

180
00:11:06,621 --> 00:11:09,500
It's basically the same equation
written infinitely often.

181
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,730
And so as long as I stick in heat,
these ratios constant,

182
00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:16,040
I'm just doing it over and over again.
So I only have to do at once.

183
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,300
So that's the [inaudible].
So it doesn't have to work out that it's,

184
00:11:20,301 --> 00:11:21,560
you know that it's just because you know,

185
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:24,680
every generation has the same endowments
and every generation has the same

186
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:27,860
utility. That's why it's such
a simple thing to solve. Yeah.

187
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,770
Is it regular PE before you raised it?

188
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:39,530
That becomes the old age consumption
price because we assumed a young age price

189
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,783
one

190
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:46,880
the p this p is just the ratio between,
this is the,

191
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,410
this is how I got p.
P t

192
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,360
p is p t over p t minus one which
also equals PT plus one over p.

193
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,890
T the ratio of all the
prices is always pee.

194
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,750
Okay. The ratio, but between
time, t and time t plus one,

195
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:10,000
this good is more valuable than that.
Good.

196
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:15,270
This good is only worth P P is 0.55
it's only worth 55% of this good.

197
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,510
And then this good here is
only worth 55% of that. Good.

198
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,470
So the symmetry assumption, you know, but,

199
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,480
but the symmetry of the problem suggest
that I could guess that the prices are

200
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:28,000
going to,

201
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,020
the present value prices are going to
decline by 50 by the same percentage every

202
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:32,854
period.

203
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,953
So,

204
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,680
okay. So let me, any other questions? I
mean we'll keep going with questions. Yes.

205
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,713
Okay.

206
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,580
Yeah. What is the endowment
of the original old guy?

207
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,970
He's the guy who owns the land.
So what does he have?

208
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:56,780
He has one apple when he's his endowment,
when he's old,

209
00:12:56,781 --> 00:12:59,000
like everybody else who's old,
he has an apple, you know,

210
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:03,620
his own tree in his backyard. Uh, it
gives them an apple when he's old. Okay.

211
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,610
Or you know, when he's an old man or
an old woman, he can sort of, you know,

212
00:13:07,611 --> 00:13:09,680
barely scrape together one apple.

213
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,930
Now he also has the land.
The land is his for all time.

214
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:20,070
So the land is paying an apple every year
forever. So his own apple, when he's,

215
00:13:20,071 --> 00:13:24,260
he, you know, at time one plus
the land's apple is this too.

216
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,320
And the land is produced as an
apple every time in the future.

217
00:13:27,321 --> 00:13:31,850
So that's his endowment. I stuck the
dividends of the land into his endowment.

218
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,993
Yeah,

219
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,580
right. I'm not assuming he
lives forever. He doesn't.

220
00:13:40,581 --> 00:13:42,830
In fact he knows he's
going to die in period one.

221
00:13:42,831 --> 00:13:46,000
He wants to do all this consuming
in period one, but he hasn't.

222
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,930
So that's another subtle thing about this.

223
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:53,030
You can own endowments that
you know occur after your dad.

224
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:57,140
You know the, the, the, the, if you
own a tree, the tree is going to be,

225
00:13:57,141 --> 00:13:59,810
the land is going to be producing
stuff long after you're dead.

226
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,980
So when you sell off the land, you're
selling off those future dividends. Okay?

227
00:14:03,981 --> 00:14:04,341
Of course,

228
00:14:04,341 --> 00:14:07,040
you're not going to hold the land if
you don't care about your children,

229
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:10,370
you're not going to hold the land beyond
the time you live because you want to

230
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:11,750
just consume as much as you can.

231
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:14,000
So you're going to sell
off the land and consume,

232
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:18,830
but you're selling off all of
these future dividends. Okay?

233
00:14:18,831 --> 00:14:22,970
So another thing this model
gives us is a new argument.

234
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:30,900
Argument for the real interest rate
real are being greater than zero.

235
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,830
So why is it because from this formula,

236
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,360
gosh, I was so clever. Where did I,
Oh, here for the price of the acids,

237
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,610
this counter dividends,

238
00:14:44,611 --> 00:14:49,611
that's going to be one over one plus
r plus one over one plus r squared,

239
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,580
plus one over one plus r cubed,
plus dot, dot, dot. By the way,

240
00:14:55,581 --> 00:15:00,160
that's equal to p plus p squared plus Pq.

241
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,000
Do you notice?
Okay,

242
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:07,030
so the discounted value of the
dividends is the price of land.

243
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,290
So the price of land of course has to be
finite, you know, because I mean it's,

244
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,990
the old guy owned a thing worth
an infinite amount of money.

245
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:16,850
He'd sell it and he buy
everything in the world.

246
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:18,520
So if you're going to have equilibrium,
you know,

247
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,970
there's no plot of land that sells
for 10 you know, for $100 trillion.

248
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,000
The price of every plot of
land to some finite amount.

249
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,660
So if the land is producing, you
know, I think it's sort of realistic.

250
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,200
Land is probably gonna produce forever.
As long as the world last,

251
00:15:33,201 --> 00:15:35,030
if you've got land,
you'll get something out of it.

252
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:38,450
Someone will always want the land. And
so if it's going to have a finite price,

253
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:42,530
the whole future dividends have to
be discounted to a finite number.

254
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,770
If you put zero in here
for are you get infinity.

255
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,800
So this presence of land is forcing
the discount rate above zero.

256
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,221
Okay.

257
00:15:52,221 --> 00:15:55,370
So it's another argument the Fisher never
would've thought of him cause he never

258
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,230
thought about infinities
or anything like that.

259
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:01,010
Another argument for the interest rate.
Real interest rate being positive.

260
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,600
Okay.
Any other questions about this?

261
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:11,260
So we reduce it to one equation and
I'll put back the p here in just one

262
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:12,374
unknown.

263
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,833
Okay.

264
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,530
Okay. Equals five. And we solve
it and then get peak was 0.55.

265
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,950
Okay.
And it's a quadratic equation.

266
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:35,360
So you can all solve a quadratic
equations now in this. Oh,

267
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,080
okay. What else do I want to say? So now

268
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,100
you could analyze all sorts of things.

269
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:45,620
You could do the same
comparative statics Fisher does.

270
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:49,520
So we changed the utility
function and made this, you know,

271
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:53,030
a third instead of a half that
would correspond to doing what?

272
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,640
Making people more,

273
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,750
more what? Impatient. Okay.

274
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:07,220
And what would you think would happen
to the interest rate? Go Up. Okay.

275
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:10,430
So in the XL file we're going to do just
that and we're going to see it's going

276
00:17:10,431 --> 00:17:13,430
to go up. Instead, we could, um,

277
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,290
we could do the social security thing
and we could have every young person give

278
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,880
something to the previous old,

279
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:23,690
which means everybody's endowment goes
from say three to two and one to two.

280
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,590
Okay. So they get more in the future
and lesson early on. So again,

281
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:31,060
you could resolve for equilibrium and
Fisher saying if we've got worn down in

282
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:36,050
the future and less than
the present, you're going to
have a higher, um, a higher,

283
00:17:36,051 --> 00:17:39,320
a real interest rates. You've got a
higher real interest rate, you know,

284
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:43,670
you could make the land more productive
and change this to a two everywhere and

285
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:48,350
see what happens. Okay, so
in this XL file, I do that.

286
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:52,050
Maybe I'll come back to that. So we're
going to do those experiments in a second.

287
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,910
Uh, but now I do, I want to do two,

288
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,820
two more things before I end
this. The first is, I want to say,

289
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:01,680
suppose we had growth in the economy.

290
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:09,490
So what if you had growth?
Where am I going to add growth over here?

291
00:18:09,491 --> 00:18:12,490
I shouldn't have erased that.
So let's have growth.

292
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,640
Okay,
what happens?

293
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:25,620
Well, Tobin, you know, Yale's greatest
economist after Irving Fisher,

294
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:30,600
he said something which was 90% right,
but not 100%, right? He said, you know,

295
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:33,390
I pointed out to him that I got
these guys at social security.

296
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,390
I worked with them.
And anyway,

297
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:38,790
these people at Social Security and
the social security administration

298
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:43,560
calculated who were the
biggest beneficiaries of
social security and was Tobin's

299
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,340
generation, the same generations,
my father. And he said, look,

300
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:49,620
it's your fault that social
security is such a mess.

301
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,820
You benefited and I'm going to have
to pay for it. And He, you know,

302
00:18:53,821 --> 00:18:56,270
just like you're feeling, you're
going to have to pay for it. Um,

303
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,600
so it's even worse for you.

304
00:18:57,601 --> 00:19:00,060
But even my generation's not
getting a very good deal.

305
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:03,000
Yours is getting a terrible deal to opens,
got a great deal.

306
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,720
And so he said to me,
it's not his fault,

307
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:09,420
it's my fault because I didn't
have enough children. Okay.

308
00:19:09,421 --> 00:19:13,050
So the question is what happens if
you, you know, what does that mean?

309
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:18,051
So what Tobin meant is that if instead
of having one child for every adult,

310
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,570
okay, so every family has
two children. In other words,

311
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:25,470
instead of one fam child for every adult.
So it goes three one, three, one, three,

312
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:28,110
one we start doubling the size.
You know,

313
00:19:28,111 --> 00:19:32,310
the generations are growing through time.
So since this is 30 years or something,

314
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,990
we can think of the generations doubling.

315
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:37,740
That wouldn't be such a fast growth rate.
And so Tobin would say, uh, you know,

316
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:40,500
might've meant if you
double the generations,

317
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,430
you're going to have six and
two is the endowment, you know,

318
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:48,000
two guys at three and one which means
six and two that you're going to have 12

319
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:51,150
and four. It's going to
be a gigantic, uh, growth.

320
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,390
And so each generation when it's old,

321
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,950
the young guys only if they're
six and two here now instead of,

322
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,850
so I should use a different color
if I wrote six and two here,

323
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:04,920
okay,

324
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,270
if I put six and two there,
then each guy would have to,

325
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,760
or two guys at three and one each three,

326
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:16,590
one guy would only have to
give up half. Uh, we don't,

327
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:17,610
we have to give up

328
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:23,330
half of his down at half a unit
because there'd be two of them,

329
00:20:23,331 --> 00:20:27,530
each giving half a unit to the old
guy and each one when he gets old,

330
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,800
getting a full unit.
So this guy would get a full unit.

331
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,860
The next generation would only give up
half of unit because there were four

332
00:20:33,861 --> 00:20:35,960
times as many people
in the next generation.

333
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,040
Each of them would still give a half
making these two old guys get their full

334
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:43,670
one and when they got old, they'd
similarly get a full one each of them.

335
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:48,910
So it would seem that if he had a faster
growing population than social security

336
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,060
would be a much better deal because the
young would have to give a bless to the

337
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:55,180
old and still get fully
paid back when they are old.

338
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,150
And so social security wouldn't
have been a problem. Okay.

339
00:20:58,151 --> 00:21:01,150
So why isn't that a totally,
so why wasn't it our fault?

340
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:02,530
My fault and your generation,

341
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:04,930
there's probably not going to have
any more children than my generation.

342
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,860
So what's the, uh, is that
true Tobin's argument?

343
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,820
Is it true that if we just had enough
children we could pay it? You know,

344
00:21:13,821 --> 00:21:15,920
no one would have to lose
out and social security,

345
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:19,520
we could make the original generation
better off and also every other generation

346
00:21:19,521 --> 00:21:21,770
after that better off.
Yup.

347
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,453
Okay.

348
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:36,750
Right. Okay. Exactly. And
so you can't know that until
you actually solve a model.

349
00:21:36,751 --> 00:21:41,710
So the point is that if the
generations keep growing like that, um,

350
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,950
the interest rate is going to go up.

351
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,820
And so it's still going to
be a loss because although
you're going to be trading

352
00:21:47,821 --> 00:21:52,821
off minus a half to get one as
opposed to minus one to get one.

353
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,620
So this looks like a much better scenario.
You're going,

354
00:21:55,621 --> 00:21:58,530
once you get to this scenario, there's
going to be a bigger interest rate.

355
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:03,560
So remember the present value of that
trade is minus one plus one over one plus

356
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:07,620
r. That's why it's negative
cause ours positive here,

357
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:12,650
it's minus one minus a half
plus one over one plus R.

358
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:17,520
Okay. But that's a different are,
that's an are, I'll put it at the top.

359
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,830
That's an annuity economy,
a growing economy.

360
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,860
And that our is going to be a bigger are.
So you're going to,

361
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,890
even though it's minus
a half instead of one,

362
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,710
this thing's going to be small and I'll
see you still ended up losing money.

363
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,050
Okay. But you'd never know
that unless you solved it.

364
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,270
And in fact it's still going to depend
on a little delicate assumption.

365
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:37,860
So I claim, so Tobin, by the way,
never bothered to work this out.

366
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,360
I claim that

367
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,040
if you're going to be doubling
the population like this,

368
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,680
they're going to be a lot more
people working on the land.

369
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:51,000
And so the dividends of the land are
probably going to grow at the same rate.

370
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,810
So I would add a two here,
you know,

371
00:22:54,811 --> 00:22:59,700
I'd make the dividends of the land also
double if the population doubled. Okay,

372
00:22:59,701 --> 00:23:01,710
so the land dividends are going to grow.

373
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,080
And so now you can see why the interest
rate has to go up because the present

374
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:10,050
value of the land still
has to be a finite number.

375
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:13,950
The present discounted value
of the dividends and the
dividends are growing than

376
00:23:13,951 --> 00:23:16,860
the interest rate had better be growing
even faster if you're going to make that

377
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:19,410
a finite number. So sure
enough, when you solve it,

378
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,310
you're going to get a higher interest
rate. Okay. And so how would you solve it?

379
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,070
Let's say the growth rate

380
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,870
equals one plus is g.
So one plus g,

381
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:39,871
you know the growth rate is g and so
every generation has one plus g times

382
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:41,920
bigger,
the previous generation.

383
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:46,730
So what would you can just
change this equation very simply.

384
00:23:46,731 --> 00:23:47,570
What would you do?

385
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,753
Well,

386
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,410
for any generation,

387
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:57,860
it's the same equation except that you've
got one plus g times as many old guys

388
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,720
as you have. Oh, he's a young guys.

389
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,200
The number of young guys is one
plus g times the number of old guys.

390
00:24:07,201 --> 00:24:08,820
So if it's generation tea,

391
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:14,150
so this will be one plus at time t this
would be one plus g to the t minus one.

392
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,560
And this would get multiplied

393
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,140
by one plus g to the T.
Okay.

394
00:24:22,141 --> 00:24:26,910
And then the dividend five, the the, so
everybody's endowment is also going up.

395
00:24:26,911 --> 00:24:30,720
So would be,
well actually I screwed up.

396
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:32,340
It would be um,

397
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,240
the old guy one times one plus g to the
t minus one plus the young guys times

398
00:24:40,321 --> 00:24:45,321
one plus g to the t plus the dividend
times one plus g to the t or t minus one,

399
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,000
whichever. Um, okay, so
that's the new equation.

400
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,920
And then he can mult you can
divide through by one plus
g to the t minus one. So,

401
00:24:55,921 --> 00:25:00,870
right. So this is for equate, this is
period teens market clearing equation.

402
00:25:00,871 --> 00:25:04,800
But you see I haven't. Okay. Because
the number of old guys is, you know,

403
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,690
for each one of them's behaving like that.

404
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:11,190
But they're now this many of them and the
young guys are behaving justice before,

405
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,040
but there are this many of them,
more of them.

406
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:17,910
And then the endowments of the old
have been grown that for, you know,

407
00:25:17,911 --> 00:25:19,770
the old generation has
this many endowments.

408
00:25:19,771 --> 00:25:23,600
The young has this much endowments when
young and then the land we also assumed

409
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:24,900
grew.
Okay.

410
00:25:24,901 --> 00:25:29,250
So you can just now divide through by
one plus g to the t minus one and that

411
00:25:29,251 --> 00:25:30,084
goes away.

412
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:35,900
And that just leaves that Matt goes away
and that goes away and that goes away.

413
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,580
So you'd have that equation all? No. Yes,

414
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,080
he was afraid someone was
going to do that. Okay.

415
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:49,170
So let's just see where
I got this equation from.

416
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,260
Okay. So I took my original
equation, which didn't have
any one plus cheese in it.

417
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,990
And I just said if I had
growth in the economy,

418
00:26:04,991 --> 00:26:07,180
it's no big deal to
take that into account.

419
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:10,150
I'm still going to have one
equation so I can still solve it.

420
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:14,530
It's just that it every time
t how many old guys do I have?

421
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:19,770
I have each old guy behaving the same
way as before except that now you know

422
00:26:20,471 --> 00:26:24,700
there's been a growth of one plus g.
This is a generation before this one.

423
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,540
So this generation is of size
one plus g to the t minus one.

424
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,740
The young generation,

425
00:26:29,741 --> 00:26:33,490
which is one generation ahead has
grown by a factor of one plus cheese.

426
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:38,050
So there's one plus g to the t of
these guys. So I take their old demand,

427
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:38,651
you know,

428
00:26:38,651 --> 00:26:42,520
the same for each guy but different
number of guys and the young generations

429
00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:45,090
demand.
And I have to set it equal to the supply,

430
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,490
but that's just the old guys endowment.

431
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,210
So one for each old guy and at that many
old guys plus the young guys endowment,

432
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,560
same as before. And there are
that many of them. Plus, uh,

433
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:00,690
the land which I've also assumed
has been doubling one plus j is two.

434
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,970
So the land is also jumbling,

435
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:07,440
and I'm not sure whether I called this
t or t minus one, but you, you know,

436
00:27:07,441 --> 00:27:10,980
either one, it's not going to
make a big difference. Okay,

437
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,430
so who asks the questions?
Who followed that? Right.

438
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,050
So now I just say I can simple,

439
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,140
I've got one plus g's everywhere
so I can cancel a lot of them out.

440
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,190
That's all I did. So if I divide
by one plus g to the t minus one,

441
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:27,700
I just get rid of the one plus g
to the tea. Mine is ones I change,

442
00:27:27,701 --> 00:27:30,990
one plus g t to the t divided by
one plus g to the t minus one.

443
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:33,930
That's just to the first
power I got rid of this one.

444
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,550
I made this to the first power
in this to the first power. Okay?

445
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:42,300
So I can solve that perfectly easily.

446
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:47,110
Okay. And I'll do that
in excel in a second. So,

447
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,930
and then we can see what
happens to everybody's utility.

448
00:27:49,931 --> 00:27:51,820
So any questions about what I did here?

449
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,080
Yes.
I know you said it doesn't matter.

450
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,960
Yeah, it's going to change the
answer, but it's going to qualitative.

451
00:28:07,961 --> 00:28:08,794
We'd be the same.

452
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,110
Well it depends whether when I do
this, I want to say this is two, four,

453
00:28:18,111 --> 00:28:22,010
eight 16 or whether I want to
call it one, two, four, eight 16.

454
00:28:22,011 --> 00:28:26,240
So I don't know which is the right thing
to probably, I should have done one, two,

455
00:28:26,241 --> 00:28:29,850
four, eight probably the way I
have it here, which is t minus one.

456
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,373
MMM.

457
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,300
Okay.
Any other questions about this?

458
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:44,640
Okay,
so the last thing to do is to um,

459
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,300
there's do it numerically cause it's a
pain to have to solve these, uh, you know,

460
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:54,090
this quadratic things, it's only one
equation but it's still a pain to solve.

461
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,750
And I happen to have written a file
that you can use to solve these all

462
00:28:59,751 --> 00:29:00,620
automatically.

463
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,180
Well this doesn't look too good.

464
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,933
Good.

465
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:28,510
Okay. So the first one, the first
case I did is I say suppose a,

466
00:29:28,511 --> 00:29:32,050
that's the exponent for how
patient you are. It's half. Okay.

467
00:29:32,051 --> 00:29:34,900
That's the first exponent,
you know, half, half.

468
00:29:34,901 --> 00:29:39,901
So I always can make the log utilities
that two x the two coefficients.

469
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,020
So it's a log.

470
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:46,500
So I'm assuming utility here you have
young and old is a log young plus be it a

471
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,880
plus one minus say log
old old consumption.

472
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,970
Okay, so a I took to be a half,
that's just what we were figuring out.

473
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,510
I took the endowments when young to be
three and one old to be one in the land

474
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,300
output to be one forever.
And then when you know,

475
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:11,980
the price is what I'm going to
try and solve for. And so I uh,

476
00:30:11,981 --> 00:30:12,461
you know,

477
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:17,461
I solve the market clearing equation and
squared it did the XL solver and I got

478
00:30:18,491 --> 00:30:22,150
the consumption, which we figured out
was one, seven, seven, five, one young.

479
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,440
And when old was

480
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:31,260
3.225 which adds up to the two of them
add up to five together just as we

481
00:30:31,451 --> 00:30:32,284
thought.

482
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,550
And so I even calculated the
utility of each of the people.

483
00:30:36,551 --> 00:30:38,170
I didn't took log utility.

484
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:43,530
Actually I wrote a monotonic transfers
mation I put why to the a z to the one

485
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:47,590
minus say it was easier for me to, you
can get positive numbers. That's just a,

486
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:52,750
that's e to the u. So I might as well
describe utility as the exponent of you.

487
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,730
Take e to it. So it's a positive number.
When you do logs of small numbers,

488
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:01,450
you get negative. So that's easier
to look at. So that's the utility.

489
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,580
Okay,
now we can do social security.

490
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,290
What happens with social security?

491
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:11,170
The only effect of social
security remembers the same model.

492
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,080
You just take stuff away from
the young and give it to the old.

493
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,040
So nothing changes except the youngs and
diamond goes down to two and the olds

494
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:23,260
endowment goes up to two and then the
rest of the model is exactly the same.

495
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:26,290
And so of course it's going to give
you a different price. PA is different,

496
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:31,270
so PA is smaller, that means today's
price of next year's good is smaller.

497
00:31:31,271 --> 00:31:36,130
That must be more discounting.
So I did the interest rate one over one,

498
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,170
you know one over one plus r equals p.

499
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:42,520
So the inverse of p is this thing.
Okay?

500
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:47,521
So if the Ford way does 161% and if
you think of that as 30 to 30 years,

501
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:51,250
that's an annualized 3.2% interest rate.

502
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:54,640
Before it was only a 2%
interest rate annualized, right?

503
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:59,710
Remember we got the one one
plus R to be 181% 1.81 so are,

504
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:03,040
is there any 1% okay.

505
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:08,041
So this social security
doubled the interest rate
from 81% to 161% huge increase

506
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:14,290
in the interest rate. So social security
has raised the interest rate and so,

507
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:18,370
you know, you resolve the whole
equilibrium and it had, you know,

508
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:19,960
not it didn't crush everybody,

509
00:32:19,961 --> 00:32:24,961
but everybody's utility went down
except for the very first generation.

510
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:28,810
We know they, they,
they won for free. Okay.

511
00:32:28,811 --> 00:32:32,770
But now I could do the same thing
with, uh, with growth. Okay?

512
00:32:32,771 --> 00:32:34,900
I could just solve that
equation on the left.

513
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:40,140
And so I plug in now the growth rate from
generation to generation plus growth.

514
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,290
And here I've got

515
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,063
mmm.

516
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,180
Two. Okay? So it doubles every period.
Just the example I did. And so I solve it.

517
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,230
And you see that of course when the
generations growing and land is being more

518
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:56,510
productive and they're more
apples and stuff like that,

519
00:32:56,511 --> 00:32:58,430
there's just more for
everybody to consume.

520
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,640
It's actually made everybody better off.
Okay.

521
00:33:01,641 --> 00:33:06,080
But now we see that Tobin and the
interest rate is higher way higher.

522
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:11,110
247% instead of 161% okay?

523
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:15,020
If I do. Now social security
in the growing economy,

524
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:20,450
every generation one young
only has to give up half a uh,

525
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,930
an apple and get oh, you know,
and get a whole apple when old.

526
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,340
So that raises the interest
rate from 400 from, um,

527
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:29,301
you know,

528
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:34,301
247% to 300% annualized from 4% to 4.7%.

529
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,310
Okay? So, uh, it's,

530
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:41,390
the rate of growth is faster now than
the growth of the economy, right?

531
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:46,400
This interest rate 247,
300% is faster than the rate of growth,

532
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:50,930
which is 100%. So again,
everybody is going to lose.

533
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:52,550
They're going to go from 3.06.

534
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:55,370
There's still going to lose by
social security to go down to three.

535
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,220
But Tobin would,
I would say is 90% right.

536
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:02,900
Although more children doesn't solve
the social security problem cause it's

537
00:34:02,901 --> 00:34:05,450
going to continue to, it's going
to increase the rate of interest.

538
00:34:05,451 --> 00:34:08,360
So you're still going to have losers.
Nonetheless.

539
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,160
The loss is now much smaller with
lots of children than it was before.

540
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,620
So Tobin I would say is 90% right.

541
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:18,230
If only every generation
would have more children,

542
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,920
we still would have had a crisis in
social security. We still would have had,

543
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:25,430
you know, this, every generation
complaining it was getting a bad deal,

544
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,570
but it would be a lot worse. It would
be a lot less bad than it was before.

545
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,130
Okay. So, um, and then I did this variant,

546
00:34:34,131 --> 00:34:37,370
depending on what we said,
whether the growth was,

547
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,640
whether I had a g to the t or
a g to the t minus one there,

548
00:34:40,641 --> 00:34:43,490
it doesn't really change that
much. Okay. So that's it.

549
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:48,700
So you see just by a very
simple modification of the
problem you can resolve.

550
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,740
You know, you can just, it's just
the understanding is so much,

551
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:55,880
at least in my mind, so much clearer
now about what role growth pay plays.

552
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,060
Having more children doesn't make the
problem go away. It makes it better,

553
00:34:59,061 --> 00:35:02,000
but you can never make it
grow away because the interest
rate is always going to

554
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:04,460
be higher than the rate
of growth of the economy.

555
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:06,723
Okay,

556
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:11,250
so let's do one last
experiment on this stuff.

557
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:17,790
Okay. Another problem to
resolve. So this was a big, uh,

558
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,370
I wrote a paper.
Uh,

559
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:24,660
the newspapers were saying the same sorts
of things and I'll tell you what they

560
00:35:24,661 --> 00:35:26,280
were saying.
Um,

561
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,143
oh no,

562
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:40,810
I d mistake.
Sorry.

563
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,320
Okay.
So

564
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:54,320
remember those pictures that we
showed before of the stock market,

565
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,930
if you discount for it,
if you take out inflation,

566
00:35:56,931 --> 00:36:00,710
the stock market seems to go when these
waves where prices go up and then they

567
00:36:00,711 --> 00:36:03,920
come down and prices go up and they
come down and prices go up and they come

568
00:36:03,921 --> 00:36:04,460
down.

569
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:09,080
We've had five big waves of stock
market's going up and coming down.

570
00:36:09,081 --> 00:36:11,300
We're now in a period where
they've been coming down, you know,

571
00:36:11,301 --> 00:36:15,770
the stock market is lower now than it was
10 years ago, correcting for inflation,

572
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,590
in fact even not correcting for inflation.
So how,

573
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,130
why would you expect that to happen?
Is there any logic to that?

574
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:25,760
So here's an old picture of
the stock market. So this,

575
00:36:25,761 --> 00:36:29,900
I wrote this paper in 2005 so remember
at the first class we had a picture like

576
00:36:29,901 --> 00:36:33,680
this. You can see the stock market going
up and down, up and down, up and down,

577
00:36:33,681 --> 00:36:36,560
up and down five waves.
It's now come down further.

578
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:41,630
This is like 2001 or two. So it's
come down way further than that. Okay,

579
00:36:41,631 --> 00:36:45,710
so is there any explanation
for why that would happen? Um,

580
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:52,360
so here's an explanation.
I gave a paper,

581
00:36:52,361 --> 00:36:56,050
which a lot of people in the
newspapers were giving. I said,

582
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:00,670
the baby boomers, I said, you know,
all these baby boomers like me,

583
00:37:00,671 --> 00:37:03,220
we're getting old.
We're going to start selling our stocks.

584
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:07,060
And so the stock market's going
to go down. And so my account,

585
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,950
so that's what newspapers were saying too.

586
00:37:08,951 --> 00:37:13,930
The difference is that the economists
criticize the newspapers and me and they

587
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:17,200
say, oh, you're crazy.
They said the stock market,

588
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,800
it can't be that the stock market is
going to go down and everybody knows it's

589
00:37:20,801 --> 00:37:23,740
going to go down because if we knew
it was going to go down in the future,

590
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:27,700
it would have already gone down now.
And uh,

591
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:32,470
so okay, so you have to give an argument.

592
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:36,040
So what I pointed out was that the,

593
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:41,080
if you look at the history of live birth,
you get the same cycle.

594
00:37:41,081 --> 00:37:45,580
Look at when up and down, up and down.
I don't know if you can lead that.

595
00:37:45,581 --> 00:37:50,020
I can hardly read it myself. What
years are the Pi's? It's so unreadable.

596
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:57,220
Let's just see if I blow it up a little
bit, whether that, okay, now I can see it.

597
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:57,701
Okay,

598
00:37:57,701 --> 00:38:02,701
so this is 91020304050 607080902000.

599
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:08,110
So you can see these are live
births. So birth, you know,

600
00:38:08,111 --> 00:38:12,640
there was a baby boom and then a
plummet and another huge baby. Boom.

601
00:38:12,641 --> 00:38:15,310
That's the famous baby.
Boom, my baby boom.

602
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,950
And then a plummet and then there
was another baby boom, you know,

603
00:38:17,951 --> 00:38:20,170
I forgot what they call it,
the x generation or whatever it is,

604
00:38:20,171 --> 00:38:24,880
some other baby boom that
happened. Basically my baby
boomers, me having lots of,

605
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,310
you know, having children,
another big baby boom.

606
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,630
And then birth rates are going to go down.
So I think that you are the, you know,

607
00:38:31,631 --> 00:38:34,240
the number of 18 year
olds in the country is,

608
00:38:34,241 --> 00:38:39,241
you know at its all high or it's going
to be in two years when my four son tries

609
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:43,180
to get into college and so there so
and then it's going to go down again.

610
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:48,420
So this is a cyclical thing that keeps
happening over and over again with baby

611
00:38:49,001 --> 00:38:53,170
booms and busts and everybody knows
about the baby boom after the war.

612
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:57,940
My generation, the 50s and 60s when I
was born, everybody knows about that,

613
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,270
but they don't realize that there's been
baby boom after baby after baby boom

614
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:03,220
and this is a cyclical phenomenon.

615
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:08,380
And then the thing they really don't
know is that it's exactly the same as the

616
00:39:08,381 --> 00:39:12,940
stock market that the stock market
follow those five patterns in the stock

617
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:16,390
market where the same patterns
of the baby boom. Okay.

618
00:39:16,391 --> 00:39:20,620
So I'm going to end with
that picture. So, um,

619
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:23,260
okay,
so a picture is worth a thousand words,

620
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:26,170
but it's not that compelling an argument.
You need a little bit of analytics.

621
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:30,070
Suppose everybody knew that generations
we're going to get bigger and then

622
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:34,570
smaller and then bigger and then smaller
with the stock market go up and then

623
00:39:34,571 --> 00:39:36,880
down and then up and then
down as I was saying.

624
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,210
And it's all these newspaper columnists
were saying or would it just stay the

625
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:44,590
same as these, um, less imaginative,

626
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,170
it kind of condoms, cra credit. You know,

627
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,680
critiquers were saying that it couldn't
have anything to do with demography

628
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:54,130
because by rationality people would look
forward and they'd anticipated going

629
00:39:54,131 --> 00:39:58,210
down and so they'd all cell before it
went down. So it never go down and, okay,

630
00:39:58,211 --> 00:40:01,030
so that, so it turns out it
does go up and down. Okay.

631
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:02,710
And that argument the economist gave,

632
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,180
it doesn't make any sense because they
were implicitly assuming that the rate of

633
00:40:07,181 --> 00:40:09,100
interest stayed the same the whole time.

634
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,500
And if the rate of interest
doesn't stay the same,

635
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:15,220
then there's no reason why the
stock market has to stay the same.

636
00:40:15,221 --> 00:40:19,530
So let's go back to where we were
before and changed the model a little

637
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,433
fit.

638
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:27,370
So let's suppose that the model
is an alternation between big,

639
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,860
between big generations
and small generations.

640
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,730
So let's suppose that
you have six, two, three,

641
00:40:37,731 --> 00:40:39,290
one and six too.

642
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:46,740
And I think I kept, that was a good
question. What should I do with land?

643
00:40:46,741 --> 00:40:48,720
I think I kept it at one every period.

644
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,260
Okay.

645
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,770
No, I hope that wasn't the
key to the result. Okay.

646
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:57,200
So in the paper of course I had,
you know,

647
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:02,300
people livings 80 years and
I had their income, you know,

648
00:41:02,301 --> 00:41:05,400
reflecting the sort of trend in income
over the lifetime. But I don't really,

649
00:41:05,401 --> 00:41:07,760
for the purposes of this class,

650
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,250
let's say every generation there's a
small generation work goals, you know,

651
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:17,030
young three old one, then the next
generation, which is just two guys.

652
00:41:17,031 --> 00:41:19,880
So they're both three one guys. So an
aggregate, they're going to be six,

653
00:41:19,881 --> 00:41:23,630
two and the next generations three one
the next generation six to the next

654
00:41:23,631 --> 00:41:28,490
generation is three one and it keeps
alternating like that forever. Okay.

655
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:32,960
Now how would you solve frack Librium
does the whole thing gets just much

656
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:35,240
complicated?
I mean what happens after all?

657
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,000
Are there any questions
here about what we're doing?

658
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,850
So it looks way more complicated,
but it's not.

659
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:45,260
It's a little bit more complicated, but
not much. You can still solve for this.

660
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,440
Okay, so I'm going to not spend
too much time on this because it's,

661
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:56,850
but I'm just going to show you what you
would do. So what would you do? Well,

662
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:03,700
by symmetry I claim you can guess that
they're going to be two prices a p.

663
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:10,790
So you notice that every generation only
cares about the relative price between

664
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:14,480
one and two young and when it's old.
So there's this relative price,

665
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:18,650
that relative price between consumption
of time one and time two that's going to

666
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,630
affect the generation born at time one.

667
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:23,750
It actually has no effect on
any other generation. You know,

668
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:26,540
these generations are born after that.
So this interest rate,

669
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:30,620
this relative price between these two
periods affects only one generation.

670
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,780
Okay? So, uh,

671
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,950
this generation is affected
by the interest rate between
time two and time three.

672
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:41,210
This generation has, is, is
affected by the interest rate.

673
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:46,330
But time three and time for
every generation is responding
to the interest rates

674
00:42:46,971 --> 00:42:51,680
during its life, not during another
generation's life. So by symmetry,

675
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,210
I think you could guess,

676
00:42:53,211 --> 00:42:56,900
and it turns out to be true that there's
going to be a price relative price,

677
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:02,500
I should call them small relative price
between for the small generation and a

678
00:43:04,401 --> 00:43:06,380
relative price for the big generation.

679
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:14,520
Okay. And that the same thing is going
to happen. So this is going to be,

680
00:43:14,521 --> 00:43:16,950
this relative price will be pieced small,

681
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:22,400
this'll be p big and then we'll get peace
small again here and p big connecting

682
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:28,170
these guys. And it's just going to keep
repeating itself over and over again.

683
00:43:28,171 --> 00:43:31,950
And by symmetry you, you could guess that
the equilibrium would look like that.

684
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:40,780
Is this making sense? It's not
making sense. Is it making sense?

685
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:45,330
So what would I have to check to see that
there's echo Librium will any generate?

686
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,164
So

687
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:47,543
mmm,

688
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,760
let's do a,
let's do it over here.

689
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,250
Let's do a small generation.

690
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,153
Yeah.

691
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:05,870
Oh, okay. So we never did the first.
So the first generation, yeah,

692
00:44:05,871 --> 00:44:09,320
it depends on whether we start with a
small one or a big one. But remember,

693
00:44:09,321 --> 00:44:14,321
if we can clear all the markets for
all time except the first market,

694
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:17,600
that one has to automatically clear.
That's Fisher also.

695
00:44:17,601 --> 00:44:22,070
That was vol Ross's insight. Okay. So we
know that if we can clear all of these,

696
00:44:22,071 --> 00:44:24,980
the first one's going to look very
different, but it's going to clear anyway,

697
00:44:24,981 --> 00:44:29,510
so I don't really have to worry about
it. Um, so we'll see why that works.

698
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,510
Uh,
so what are the generations,

699
00:44:32,511 --> 00:44:36,950
so I'm going to now talk about Martha
clearing it anytime except the first one

700
00:44:36,951 --> 00:44:37,940
just more complicated.

701
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:41,120
The first one seems really complicated
because there's this guy zero who owns

702
00:44:41,121 --> 00:44:42,770
these dividends that go on forever,

703
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,040
but of course they're just worth the price
of land, which he's going to sell off.

704
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:50,130
So Ben and we'll come back. Did that
in a second. So in every generation,

705
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,870
every time period,

706
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:55,860
you're either going to have the
w when small generation is young.

707
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:04,050
Okay. What do you get? What's the, what's
the market clearing equation going to be?

708
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:09,300
Well,
the small generation is going to be young,

709
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:14,160
so that means the old generation has
is big. Sorry. So there's a half year.

710
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:18,840
So the big old guys, their endowment
is going to be three, sorry,

711
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:22,080
it's going to be six. There's
two of them. So I can multiply,

712
00:45:22,081 --> 00:45:25,260
I can put the two out here.
Three plus one

713
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:27,550
P big.

714
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:32,380
Okay.
Divided by P big.

715
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:38,370
That's the big old generation plus.

716
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,040
And the young generation,
there's just the old,

717
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:44,250
they're the usual three plus one p

718
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:50,500
divided by one.K has to equal.

719
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:53,260
Now how many endowments do we have?

720
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:57,010
We've got two old guys plus

721
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:01,060
each owning one.
So that's two times one.

722
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,520
That's their endowment plus three.

723
00:46:03,521 --> 00:46:07,390
That's the young guys plus the
land dividends. So that's six.

724
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:16,150
So this should be peace.
Small, not PYP. Small. No,

725
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:18,670
I don't because the old guys,

726
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:24,100
the big generation is old.
So small generation is young.
So the young generation,

727
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,980
they're after,
they're consuming in their youth now.

728
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:30,100
So they're looking at their endowment.
The price when they're young is one,

729
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:33,560
so they're young. Endowment is
three, they're old endowment there.

730
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:37,940
Their income is three times the price to
them of one when they're young plus the

731
00:46:37,941 --> 00:46:41,610
endowment of one when they're old times
p small divided by the price when they

732
00:46:41,611 --> 00:46:43,570
were young, which they're
thinking of is one, right?

733
00:46:43,571 --> 00:46:47,200
They only care about the relative price
between young and old and that relative

734
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:49,960
prices is determined by p small.

735
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,080
So I could call it p t and p t plus one,

736
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:55,810
but I know that ratio
is going to be p small.

737
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,590
So really it only depends on the ratio.

738
00:46:57,591 --> 00:47:01,030
So I might as well just use
the ratio piece. Small is this,

739
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:03,830
this is a crucial idea that
I've used a hundred times.

740
00:47:03,831 --> 00:47:07,390
So I think I've used it now, you
know, three or four times. Anyway, so,

741
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:09,850
but I think some of you don't quite
know what the hell I'm talking about.

742
00:47:09,851 --> 00:47:13,030
So somebody asked me a question,
if they don't know why this is right,

743
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,150
whoever just asked it,
maybe you still don't know why it's right.

744
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:20,050
Who asked this question a minute ago?
Yes.

745
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:24,880
Do you understand how I got this? Or
you do okay. But when the old guys,

746
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:28,750
so the old guys, which is the big
generation, we're, we're clearing time.

747
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:30,250
We're looking at this time.

748
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,670
So the total endowment is
three for the young generation.

749
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,670
Their endowment is two
and the one unit of land,

750
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:41,740
that's where I got the total
supply of six. So this generation,

751
00:47:41,741 --> 00:47:44,440
when it's young,
they care about the p small,

752
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:47,890
the relative price between here and here.
And so they're there,

753
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:51,670
they're looking at peace, small, the
relative price of one to p small.

754
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:56,410
The old generation at the same time is
looking over their lifetime at the ratio

755
00:47:56,411 --> 00:47:58,960
of consumption here to here,
which was given by P big.

756
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,690
So they've got a p big here
and they're consuming went old.

757
00:48:01,691 --> 00:48:06,440
So the dividing by P big.
Okay.

758
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,780
But now we've got a second equation,

759
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:11,840
which is when the,

760
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:16,990
when a big generation is young,

761
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,820
so why don't you tell me what
that equation is going to be?

762
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,440
How much is the endowment when
the big generation is young?

763
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:33,350
So that's maybe clearing at this time.
Here are the big generation is young.

764
00:48:33,351 --> 00:48:37,830
So what's the endowment
going to be?

765
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:41,190
The young, so the old, there's
only gonna be one old guy.

766
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:44,160
They're going to be too young.

767
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,210
Young guys each have endowment
of three plus one unit of,

768
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:49,440
so that's eight

769
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:54,850
and you can see that adds up to
six plus one plus one is eight.

770
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:57,990
Okay.

771
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:02,550
Okay. And what's their demand? What's the
demand for the two? So there's the old,

772
00:49:02,551 --> 00:49:04,140
what are the old going to be doing here?

773
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:09,300
It's in this generation.
We're doing the market clearing.

774
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:12,360
Somebody knows how to answer this.

775
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,073
Yeah,

776
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:25,210
over here. The young, the small
generation only has one when it's old.

777
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:30,250
But big gentleman that's over here,
we're clearing at this time period.

778
00:49:30,251 --> 00:49:34,000
So the a bunch of young guys
and just a few old guys.

779
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:39,640
So the endowments are six plus one
plus one. The time is going that way.

780
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:45,430
So that's why that's an
eight over here. One. So one.

781
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:47,670
Okay,

782
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:51,600
so this is the one old guys endowment,
two young guys who have three each.

783
00:49:51,601 --> 00:49:55,050
That's endowment of six plus
the land is once you get eight.

784
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:58,800
That's how I got an eight over there.
That's the supply. So what's the demand?

785
00:49:58,801 --> 00:50:00,330
Who's trying to buy the stuff?

786
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:05,110
But what's the demand or the old guys?

787
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:08,253
Yeah,

788
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:12,480
so and that's going to be what they're
planning to spend when they're old.

789
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:16,470
Okay, we're doing this one there. So
when the point of they make their plans,

790
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:19,200
when they young, they anticipate
what the prices are going to be.

791
00:50:19,201 --> 00:50:22,050
And so how much did they plan
to spend when they're old?

792
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,190
Three plus p.

793
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:32,090
What
over what p

794
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:36,560
pieces? Small. Exactly.

795
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:42,140
Over the small plus.

796
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:48,890
What are the young guys doing?
We're over here.

797
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,230
So two,
there are two of them.

798
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:03,220
What's this? P what big divided by

799
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,180
almost a half here. Yup. Over what

800
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:17,590
one. Okay. Exactly. So that's it. So
there are two equations in two unknowns,

801
00:51:17,591 --> 00:51:22,360
p big and p small and two equations.
So to solve this whole model,

802
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:24,910
you could get two equation.
You could you, you,

803
00:51:24,911 --> 00:51:29,670
you just have to solve these
two simultaneous equations,
which I did. Okay. Now,

804
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:30,920
okay.

805
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,810
And then you can find the effect.
So all of these old economy,

806
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:39,050
the economists critiquers would
say, well, P big should equal. Okay,

807
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,600
what,
what will be the price of land by the way?

808
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:44,720
So what's the price of land
going to be in the end?

809
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,410
What's going to be the price of land
according to Fisher at time? One

810
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,590
at time one,
let's say.

811
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:04,380
So right here,
what's the price of land?

812
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:08,190
Remember it's the price after the dividend
is paid. So what's the price of land?

813
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:16,630
Let's do the present value of the
discounted dividends. What would it be?

814
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:22,170
Maybe I better write it over here.

815
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:36,410
Remember the dividends are just
one plus one, you know, one plus.

816
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:41,440
So there's going to be one
plus one plus one plus one,

817
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:45,880
but I'm going to be discounting, but I'm
going to be multiplying by something.

818
00:52:45,881 --> 00:52:47,530
So what is the price of land?

819
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:55,440
P small incidentally equals I could
always write that is one over one plus r

820
00:52:55,441 --> 00:52:56,274
small.

821
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,280
Okay.

822
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,900
I could write p big as
one over one plus r big.

823
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,970
Okay.
So what's the price of land going to be?

824
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:07,100
Okay,

825
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:10,970
so it's the price of land starting
here just after the dividend is paid.

826
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,520
So it's very, you know, it's
hard to think about this,

827
00:53:13,521 --> 00:53:16,550
but if you can figure this out then you've
totally understood everything in the

828
00:53:16,551 --> 00:53:19,300
course because this is so much
more kind and uses all the ideas.

829
00:53:19,301 --> 00:53:22,430
I'm just way more complicated way.
Yes.

830
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,380
Well start telling me the formula.

831
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:34,160
So if I want to multiply four and I do
the first terms, what is this first term?

832
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:42,350
So you,
you would put one plus our small here?

833
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:44,150
Yeah.

834
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:46,100
Okay.
And now what would you put over here?

835
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:49,753
What

836
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,930
you'd put one plus our big here.

837
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,030
Okay,
very good.

838
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:03,240
So now you guys really know what's going
on and what would you put over here?

839
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:09,370
Okay,
exactly.

840
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:14,371
One plus our small times one plus
r big times one plus r small.

841
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:20,680
Hey, that's that one. I'm going to stop
with that too. Too much. Okay. plus.dot,

842
00:54:20,681 --> 00:54:23,890
dot. Okay, so you have the
idea now, what's the idea?

843
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:28,030
Discounting between you're taking the
present value of all the dividends.

844
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:33,160
So this, this dividend, you have to
discount it by one plus r a small.

845
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:36,700
This one you have to discount it
twice first to bring it back here.

846
00:54:36,701 --> 00:54:38,860
That's one plus our big.
Then to bring it back here,

847
00:54:38,861 --> 00:54:41,950
that's another one puts our smallest
one plus our big one plus our small,

848
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:46,300
the third dividend.
You discount first at the small discount,

849
00:54:46,301 --> 00:54:49,750
then at the big discount.
Then at the small discount just like that.

850
00:54:49,751 --> 00:54:53,020
And You keep adding them.
So why should the prices,

851
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:58,050
what if you look at the
price of land at time two?

852
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:02,260
Is it the same number?
Is that,

853
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:05,740
is it the same formula?

854
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:09,720
Yeah,

855
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,420
it's not the same it.
Well, because at time too,

856
00:55:12,421 --> 00:55:16,410
you're starting here and the
first discount is p big. Okay.

857
00:55:16,411 --> 00:55:20,790
So it's going to be one
over one plus r big plus,

858
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:24,030
one over one plus r big times,

859
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:29,390
one plus r small plus one over one plus
r big times one plus r small times one

860
00:55:32,341 --> 00:55:36,450
plus r big plus. Dot, dot, dot.
So this isn't the same as that.

861
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:40,950
Okay? It would only be the same as
that if our big was equal to our small.

862
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,520
If piece small is equal to p o p big.
So

863
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:50,280
which one,
which one do you think is a,

864
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,330
the,
which one do you think is bigger?

865
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,740
You think pee small is equal to p big
or one of them is bigger than the other.

866
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:05,963
And why?

867
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:11,870
That's the answer to the critics puzzles.
So you see,

868
00:56:11,871 --> 00:56:14,570
you've taken something that
appeared in the newspapers.

869
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:18,550
It sounds like common sense.
If there are all these young youth,

870
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:22,130
all these middle aged people like
me bidding up the Pr, you know,

871
00:56:22,131 --> 00:56:25,630
there were so many of us who want to
hold stocks with the peak of our earning

872
00:56:25,631 --> 00:56:29,570
power. We've got tremendous
amounts of money. Um, we wanna,

873
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:33,070
we wanna, you know, what are we going to
do with it? Except put it into stocks.

874
00:56:33,071 --> 00:56:35,890
You'd think common sense that the
price of stocks would have to go up.

875
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,200
When we get old and we're
selling all our stocks,

876
00:56:38,201 --> 00:56:41,350
you'd think the price of stocks
would have to go down. Okay.

877
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:46,060
So that would tell you that the
interest rate was going to be

878
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,900
bigger or smaller. So that
would, okay. So that would,

879
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:55,920
so that would suggest that the price
at time one when they're with a small

880
00:56:55,991 --> 00:57:00,460
generation was young, would be low and
the price at time two would be high. Okay.

881
00:57:00,461 --> 00:57:05,410
And that could happen if this interest
rate was low and this interest rate was

882
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:08,680
high. Okay, but does that
happen or does that happen?

883
00:57:08,681 --> 00:57:11,710
You can't know until you solve it
in the model. You know the critique,

884
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:15,530
the critics said all that can't
be right because somehow you know,

885
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,580
the price should even out and everybody
will be looking ahead and buying or

886
00:57:18,581 --> 00:57:19,690
selling at the right time.

887
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,450
You can't buy and sell at the right
time because you're going to be dead.

888
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:26,140
So you don't have much choice except
when you're young here to save.

889
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:30,710
And when you're old here to dis save. So
you know, they, they seem not to have,

890
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:34,810
I've overlooked that small
problem. So anyway. Um, okay,

891
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:39,760
so the point is that to know the answer,
you can't just reasoned it out verbally.

892
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:43,150
You have to write down a model,
solve for the model and see what happens.

893
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:48,160
And sure enough it happens. Like, okay.

894
00:57:48,161 --> 00:57:50,680
So we'll go back to the paper now.
Well,

895
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:52,140
okay.

896
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:54,180
Okay.
There are any questions about this.

897
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,633
MMM.

898
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:34,760
Okay. So all I did in this spreadsheet
is I wrote down those two equations.

899
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:38,200
So you see that I've got the um,

900
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,140
young and the old or have the
same half half log utilities,

901
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,030
the small generations,
three one,

902
00:58:44,031 --> 00:58:48,590
the big generation is six to land is
always producing one every period.

903
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:53,450
And we get two different prices.
The PA, the, the price is called Pa,

904
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:57,830
that's the age generation, which is the
small generation and the beat generation,

905
00:58:57,831 --> 00:58:59,030
which is the big generation.

906
00:58:59,031 --> 00:59:04,031
So you can see that PA is a very small
number when the generation of small,

907
00:59:04,251 --> 00:59:06,680
and that means the
discount rate is very high.

908
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:10,730
So a high interest rate
when the generation is small
and a low interest rate

909
00:59:10,731 --> 00:59:14,600
when the generations are big. So
when the, when the, when the, uh,

910
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:19,520
in the moneymaking peak
of the big generation, the
real interest rate is small.

911
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:22,190
And so that means you're
not discounting very much.

912
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:25,640
And so the prices are high of land.
And so sure enough,

913
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:29,540
the price when the small
generation is young is 1.29.

914
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:34,670
And when the big generation is young,
it's a 2.08 vastly higher.

915
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:38,590
So it really is the case that as
the generations rise and fall,

916
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:42,170
the interest rates rise and fall and
the price of land rises and falls and

917
00:59:42,171 --> 00:59:46,070
everybody's rational anticipating
everything. Okay. So,

918
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:49,340
so there really is, you know, it really
could be, I'm not saying it's true,

919
00:59:49,341 --> 00:59:52,490
you know, cause it could be a coincidence
that these things all matched up.

920
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:57,670
But the fact is demography can have a big
effect on economic equilibrium and the

921
00:59:57,921 --> 01:00:00,890
stock market. And you can be an
economist and believe in demography.

922
01:00:00,891 --> 01:00:04,640
You don't have to be a
Marxist or something to think
demography and fertility

923
01:00:04,641 --> 01:00:05,301
and all that stuff.

924
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:09,200
It's going to affect the economy and
for a long time economic strike to wall

925
01:00:09,201 --> 01:00:12,890
itself off from other
social sciences and say, oh,

926
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:15,860
those fertility people and you know,
all those touchy feely people,

927
01:00:15,861 --> 01:00:17,780
it's got nothing to do with
the wheel markets. Well,

928
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:21,080
if it has a lot to do with the real
markets. Okay, so one last thing.

929
01:00:21,081 --> 01:00:23,840
Would you rather be in the small
generation of the big generation?

930
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:30,410
Of course the answer is there,
but tell me why.

931
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:34,053
Yup.

932
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:38,970
Okay. That's correct. So I'm
screwed. And so why is that?

933
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:42,470
Okay.

934
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:46,730
Well, it turned out to be
the utility of the, um,

935
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:48,160
okay.

936
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:52,630
This is the utility of the big generation
per person. You know, of course,

937
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,070
adding the two people together,
it's bigger.

938
01:00:54,071 --> 01:00:57,790
So per person was this a lot less than
the generation of the s the utility of

939
01:00:57,791 --> 01:01:01,150
the small.
So why did that happen?

940
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:03,130
Why exactly is that happening?

941
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:04,920
Okay,

942
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,790
so remember, I'm distinguishing sort
of your peak. I'm calling young,

943
01:01:08,791 --> 01:01:11,160
your peak earning years and old.

944
01:01:11,161 --> 01:01:14,220
I'm calling the stuff when you're
retired and not earning very much.

945
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,070
So why is it that a high
interest rate is good?

946
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:20,623
Yes.

947
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:27,200
Well,
I think the,

948
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:31,810
the point is if you're making money
when you're young and you've got a high

949
01:01:31,811 --> 01:01:34,690
interest rate,
that means a high return so you,

950
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,970
you can make a big
return through your life.

951
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:40,660
Whereas my generation had a very
low return, you know, the money,

952
01:01:40,661 --> 01:01:44,530
the return I'm getting now is
terrible. It's negative. So, you know,

953
01:01:44,531 --> 01:01:47,800
the return I'm getting now is
just hideous. But when, you know,

954
01:01:47,801 --> 01:01:51,640
when my parents were young,
they were making an astronomical return.

955
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:55,270
Incredible rates of return. Okay. So,
and they were earning money, you know,

956
01:01:55,271 --> 01:01:57,100
in their younger years and,

957
01:01:57,101 --> 01:02:00,520
and investing it to save when they were
old and they're getting incredibly high

958
01:02:00,521 --> 01:02:02,740
return.
There's nothing to do with my money.

959
01:02:02,741 --> 01:02:05,710
There are so many people like me
pouring money into the stock market,

960
01:02:05,711 --> 01:02:07,210
we're getting a very bad return.

961
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:11,480
And that's why it's not so good to be
part of a big generation. So other people,

962
01:02:11,481 --> 01:02:12,820
it said the same thing.
They said,

963
01:02:12,821 --> 01:02:15,280
big generations have to
squeeze into the same houses.

964
01:02:15,281 --> 01:02:18,160
So there be less housing stock,
you know, or we build more houses.

965
01:02:18,161 --> 01:02:21,480
The next generation along through all
these houses built for them and they're

966
01:02:21,481 --> 01:02:24,150
less of them to, you know, so they
get better houses and you know,

967
01:02:24,151 --> 01:02:26,190
everything's better when
you're the small generation,

968
01:02:26,191 --> 01:02:30,960
you're screwed as the big generation.
And here's an example of it. Okay?

969
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:32,460
So that's it for social security.

970
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:37,290
All the things I wanted to say
about social security. Now the exam,

971
01:02:37,291 --> 01:02:39,930
as I say, we'll end with a, you know,

972
01:02:39,931 --> 01:02:43,170
you won't have to do the two generations
and all that stuff on the exam,

973
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:48,240
but the first part about solving for
the 0.55 that one you might have to do

974
01:02:48,241 --> 01:02:50,940
something like that. But anyway,
the lesson that you know,

975
01:02:50,941 --> 01:02:55,500
you can have a controversy in the
newspapers with arguments on both sides.

976
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:58,680
You never can figure out the right
answer to you write down a model.

977
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,390
And a lot of that can be very simple.

978
01:03:00,391 --> 01:03:02,340
The kind of thing you could
do as an undergraduate.

979
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:07,320
That's the lesson I'm trying
to communicate. All right,
so from now on though,

980
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:12,030
we have to change gears and I think the
course gets a lot more interesting. Okay.

981
01:03:12,031 --> 01:03:16,230
But we needed all this background
basics to have the logic of finance.

982
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:20,490
But finance is really nothing
without uncertainty. You know,

983
01:03:20,491 --> 01:03:22,440
if you don't know what's
going to happen tomorrow,

984
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:25,710
that's when the thing gets interesting.
That's when you have to think harder.

985
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:29,190
That's when people make mistakes. That's
when a hedge fund can make a profit.

986
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:30,210
That's when,
you know,

987
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:34,140
everything gets more exciting when
there's uncertainty and we have to start

988
01:03:34,141 --> 01:03:37,170
adding uncertainty to are
thinking about the world.

989
01:03:37,171 --> 01:03:38,610
So since they only have a few minutes,

990
01:03:38,611 --> 01:03:43,410
I'm going to spend the last few minutes
just reminding you of what you're

991
01:03:43,411 --> 01:03:45,510
supposed to know about uncertainty.

992
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:48,913
MMM.

993
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:50,960
Which is this slide.
Okay.

994
01:03:50,961 --> 01:03:54,650
So it's not a very complicated thing.

995
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:58,190
Where's the IC PowerPoint? Okay. So,

996
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:02,090
so there are two kinds of uncertainty,
one of which we're never going to get to.

997
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:05,690
So the uncertainty that we're going to
work with in this course is everybody

998
01:04:05,691 --> 01:04:10,400
understands what could possibly happen.
So this was a brilliant, uh, you know,

999
01:04:10,401 --> 01:04:13,670
states of the world model
it's called. So, uh,

1000
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:18,110
live nets is supposed to sees as states
of the world right there live next was

1001
01:04:18,111 --> 01:04:22,250
the one who first, uh, invented the
idea of states of the world. He said,

1002
01:04:22,251 --> 01:04:24,260
we live in the best of
all possible worlds.

1003
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:26,900
So if you don't know what's
going to happen in the future,

1004
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:30,860
we're going to represent that as
many potential states of the world.

1005
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:34,040
Now there are other ways you could model
uncertainty and philosophies. A big,

1006
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:37,580
you know, a big subject and
epistemology and philosophy.

1007
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:42,320
I'm going to stay hew closely to
the states of the world thing.

1008
01:04:42,321 --> 01:04:44,810
So if there's something about
the world we don't know tomorrow,

1009
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:47,900
I'm not going to assume that it's
just vague in our minds and you know,

1010
01:04:47,901 --> 01:04:51,530
we can't quite make it out. I'm going
assume you actually can make it out.

1011
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:54,260
It's just you don't know which of the
possibilities are going to happen.

1012
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:58,160
So it's many states in the world.
So a uh,

1013
01:04:58,310 --> 01:05:02,060
example of that of course is
spinning a dice or spinning to dice.

1014
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:05,900
So you don't know, you know, which of
36 possibilities is going to happen.

1015
01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:07,940
Each of those would be
one state of the world.

1016
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:10,460
Okay?

1017
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:14,960
Okay. So we can, um, you know, so
those are all the possible sums.

1018
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,770
So they're more states of the
world and there are outcomes.

1019
01:05:17,771 --> 01:05:20,470
Notice that you can get to
through 12 is the sum of the dice,

1020
01:05:20,471 --> 01:05:23,170
but there's still 36
possible states of the world.

1021
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,570
And so that random variable,

1022
01:05:25,571 --> 01:05:29,800
the sum of the two dice is expressed as
a function that says in every state of

1023
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:34,390
the world, what is the random variables
value? So our state of the world,

1024
01:05:34,391 --> 01:05:39,391
by that I mean something
that's so detailed that it
tells you the value of every

1025
01:05:40,001 --> 01:05:43,780
random variable. So that's how I'm
going to be thinking of uncertainty,

1026
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:47,710
that we're here today and a bunch of
different things could happen tomorrow.

1027
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:51,370
And this is an exhaustive list of
everything that can happen tomorrow.

1028
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:56,270
We're going to have to come
back and criticize this
assumption, but it, you know,

1029
01:05:56,350 --> 01:06:01,180
introduces uncertainty in a way which is
still quantifiable and not vague. Okay?

1030
01:06:01,181 --> 01:06:05,140
So you can talk about the histogram
of outcomes of the dice. You know,

1031
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:08,590
how many ways, what chances are the
chances of getting a seven, you know,

1032
01:06:08,591 --> 01:06:13,000
six out of 36 et cetera.
So this is stuff I'm sure you all know.

1033
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:17,710
Okay. Um, the most
famous histogram in, uh,

1034
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:20,860
in all of mathematics is
the normal distribution,

1035
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:22,810
which I don't have time to explain.

1036
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:26,280
And so a normal distribution or
memorize this exponential thing, the,

1037
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,700
the dice example, you know, is a
sort of, looks like it. In fact,

1038
01:06:30,701 --> 01:06:32,140
if you had enough,
you know,

1039
01:06:32,141 --> 01:06:35,230
you had enough dice and you
kept averaging their outcome,

1040
01:06:35,231 --> 01:06:38,350
it wouldn't be normally distributed.
So lots of things turn out to be normal.

1041
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:43,560
One of the properties of normal is
that the tail gets small very quickly.

1042
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:48,940
Okay. And so, um, you're not
going to get very many outliers.

1043
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:52,510
The normal distribution is
a very common distribution.

1044
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:55,750
There are lots of reasons why it
should occur all the time. And so it,

1045
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:58,480
and it's also mathematically
very easy to work with.

1046
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,830
And so economists for a long time assumed
everything was normally distributed.

1047
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:05,260
But an implication,
as I say,

1048
01:07:05,261 --> 01:07:08,890
of normal distribution is that it's very
unlikely something extreme is going to

1049
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:12,040
happen because this thing goes
down exponentially fast to zero.

1050
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:14,890
So you're almost never going to
see something way out here yet.

1051
01:07:14,891 --> 01:07:18,010
We get these crashes fairly
frequently. If ever, you know,

1052
01:07:18,011 --> 01:07:21,190
10 20 or 30 years or something.
There's some gigantic outlier.

1053
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:26,230
So clearly things can't be normally
distributed and that's called fat tails.

1054
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:28,780
Okay. The, and I'm sure you've
heard about that and the newspaper,

1055
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,580
we're going to come back to that.
Okay.

1056
01:07:30,581 --> 01:07:34,910
Now there are a couple
things that you need to, uh,

1057
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:41,260
no. So you can, you can
represent the payoff of any
random variable as a picture,

1058
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:44,200
you know, in every state
what its, its payoff. Okay.

1059
01:07:44,201 --> 01:07:48,220
So a riskless random variable riskless
investment will pay the same amount in

1060
01:07:48,221 --> 01:07:52,840
every state. So I still have a
few minutes here. Okay. Um, okay,

1061
01:07:52,841 --> 01:07:56,200
so now two incredibly important concepts,
which I'm sure you know, but I'm,

1062
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:59,410
or at least the mean, you know,
just the average. What's the,

1063
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:01,210
what's the expected payoff?

1064
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:05,800
So the expected payoff is you multiply
the outcome and every state by the

1065
01:08:05,801 --> 01:08:08,320
probability of the state
and you add it up. Okay,

1066
01:08:08,321 --> 01:08:13,060
so there how many different ways?
Uh, so if you have one dice,

1067
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:15,890
okay, you can figure out
the expectation of one dice.

1068
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:18,650
It's equally likely to get one,
two, three, four, five or six.

1069
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:22,610
And so if you add all those up, multiplied
by six, you get three and a half.

1070
01:08:22,611 --> 01:08:24,770
So the expectation of one
dice is three and a half.

1071
01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:29,420
The expectation of to die is therefore,
okay,

1072
01:08:29,421 --> 01:08:33,650
so, so that's okay. That's one dice, okay.

1073
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:38,210
Now the expectation of adding two dice
together and of course going to be seven

1074
01:08:38,211 --> 01:08:40,940
because the expectation of one dice is
three and a half and the other guy says

1075
01:08:40,941 --> 01:08:44,030
three and a half in there. And so
the expectation of the psalm is the,

1076
01:08:44,031 --> 01:08:46,820
some of the expectations. So it's
seven. Okay? So you know that. Now,

1077
01:08:46,821 --> 01:08:49,220
one more thing that you have
to know is the variance.

1078
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:54,760
So how do you measure how uncertain
you are about what's going to happen?

1079
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:58,970
Well, the simplest number to do,
like with the dice is to say, okay,

1080
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:02,780
the expectation is three and a half.
When we don't get three and a half,

1081
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:06,320
we're going to, it means there was some
error. Expectation wasn't confirmed.

1082
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:10,310
So you could just measure the air as the
distance between three and a half and

1083
01:09:10,311 --> 01:09:11,570
what you actually got.

1084
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:15,590
So if you've got a four you could
say you are off by a half the room,

1085
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:17,090
but it con but people don't do that.

1086
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:19,820
They they'd measure the
square of the distance. Okay.

1087
01:09:19,821 --> 01:09:23,210
And they take the average square of the
distance that's called the variance.

1088
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:26,810
Okay. So it would be, if you've got four,
when you're expecting three and a half,

1089
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:30,140
the error is a half squared.
So it's a,

1090
01:09:30,141 --> 01:09:34,370
you take a six times a half squared plus
the six times one and a half squared

1091
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:36,110
plus a six times two and a half squared.

1092
01:09:36,111 --> 01:09:38,960
That's where the high
mistakes and the low mistakes,

1093
01:09:38,961 --> 01:09:42,740
you'd take a half times a half squared
plus a half times one and a half squared

1094
01:09:42,741 --> 01:09:44,600
plus a half times two and a half squared.
Now,

1095
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:49,100
why do they use the expected squared
error instead of just the expected error?

1096
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:52,970
Well, for this simple reason,
she may not have thought of.

1097
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:55,460
If you had to guess,
if you,

1098
01:09:55,461 --> 01:10:00,050
if you look at as the error as the penalty
for making a wrong guess and you were

1099
01:10:00,051 --> 01:10:03,560
forced at the beginning to say what
guests would you like to make for how the

1100
01:10:03,561 --> 01:10:07,250
dice is going to turn out, how the dye is
going to turn out. And if you're wrong,

1101
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:11,090
w will penalize you by this
measure of error. Well,

1102
01:10:11,091 --> 01:10:12,890
if you're just taking the absolute error,

1103
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:16,460
your best guess would be any
number between three and four.

1104
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:17,870
You could say three and a half.

1105
01:10:17,871 --> 01:10:20,690
He could also say three and a quarter
because if you said three and a quarter

1106
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:21,321
you'd meet,

1107
01:10:21,321 --> 01:10:24,800
you'd become closer on all the low rolls
of the dice and be a little further off

1108
01:10:24,801 --> 01:10:27,770
on all the high roles and you'd
get exactly the same error.

1109
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:30,650
So you could say any number
between three and four.

1110
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:34,850
But if you make the s the error
of the square of the mistake,

1111
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:39,590
your best guess is always
to say the expectation.

1112
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:41,720
Three and a half is the only is the,
is the,

1113
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:45,350
is the only thing you can say to minimize
your expected penalty if the penalty

1114
01:10:45,351 --> 01:10:49,220
is the squared error. So
because of that, um, so that,

1115
01:10:49,221 --> 01:10:51,650
that's connected to a
mathematical thing and you know,

1116
01:10:51,651 --> 01:10:54,710
in orthogonal vectors and
all that because of that, uh,

1117
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:57,470
the error we talk about
always is the squared error.

1118
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,630
And so that's whenever
we're measuring uncertainty,

1119
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:02,450
we're going to talk about
the square to error,

1120
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,000
the average of the squared errors
of the square root of that,

1121
01:11:05,001 --> 01:11:07,280
which is called the standard deviation.
Okay.

1122
01:11:07,281 --> 01:11:11,180
I've one more minute to just finish this.
So this is, I'm assuming you all, uh,

1123
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:16,140
no that okay. Or can learn that. Okay. One
more thing. I'm going to assume, you know,

1124
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:18,180
the last thing is the covariance.

1125
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:23,390
What does it mean to say that random
variables x and y move in the same

1126
01:11:23,461 --> 01:11:26,940
direction?
So this was quite a brilliant thought.

1127
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:32,060
So what it means is that to move in the
same direction means if x surprises you

1128
01:11:32,131 --> 01:11:36,930
by being above what you would
have expected. So if the
expectation of x as x bar,

1129
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:39,330
and the expectation of y is y bar,

1130
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:43,230
if you multiply the two and they're
both higher than you expected,

1131
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:46,140
you'll get a positive number.
If they're both lower than expected,

1132
01:11:46,141 --> 01:11:49,650
you'll also get a positive number.
So by taking this some,

1133
01:11:49,651 --> 01:11:53,880
the expected deviation from
the expectation multiplied,

1134
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:56,100
you get a number,
which when it's very positive,

1135
01:11:56,101 --> 01:11:58,950
it means they're either both positive
together, both negative together.

1136
01:11:58,951 --> 01:12:00,690
So they're going in the same direction.

1137
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:04,170
If one of them is above the average
while the other one's below the average,

1138
01:12:04,171 --> 01:12:05,390
then you'll get a negative numbers.

1139
01:12:05,391 --> 01:12:09,330
So big covariance means they
move in the same direction,

1140
01:12:09,331 --> 01:12:12,780
big negative covariance they move means
they move in the negative direction.

1141
01:12:12,781 --> 01:12:15,540
Okay? So I'm going to take it
for granted, you know, vis,

1142
01:12:15,541 --> 01:12:19,410
and we're going to take this up
starting right after the exam,

1143
01:12:19,411 --> 01:12:20,910
which was on Tuesday.
