1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,120
So,
uh,

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,860
we're now at the stage
where we're considering the
implications of uncertainty.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:13,070
So I hope that the subtlety and surprise
element of the class will gradually

4
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:17,940
pick up, uh, without
increasing the difficulty.

5
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:20,760
The complexity will pick up a little bit,
but not the difficulty.

6
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:22,920
It's just you have to keep a
few more things in your head,

7
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:26,520
but the mathematics isn't any harder.
So we started,

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,820
we ended last time talking about default
and inferring default probabilities.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,760
And so I just want to
finish off that discussion.

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,780
So suppose that at any stage of the tree,
you know,

11
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:44,610
lots of things can happen in the world.

12
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:48,540
We're always going to model the
uncertainty in the future by a tree with

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,130
different things happening.

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,400
And at each of these nodes people
are going to have a discount rate.

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,580
So maybe it'll be a, you know, uh,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,770
r equals 20% and here are could equal 15%,

17
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:05,820
something like that.

18
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,510
And we want to add to this the
possibility that there's the fault.

19
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,710
So if we add the possibility of default,
you know,

20
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,470
on these things keep going and maybe
their payoffs at the end or pay offs along

21
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:20,304
the way.

22
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,030
If at any point in the tree like this one,
we add a new possibility,

23
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:29,950
which is the default possibility.

24
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,100
Okay?

25
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,730
And we assume, so this just
happens by when new people to fall,

26
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,860
they never default before
they have to make a payment.

27
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,460
So when do they default exactly when
they're supposed to make a payment.

28
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,760
So suppose that this guy is going to
default here when he's going to make a

29
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:53,180
payment. You know what every possible
scenario he would default there.

30
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:58,130
So you've got a very simple
uh, model of default. Okay?

31
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,720
So not a very realistic one where the
guy defaults in all of these following

32
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:06,800
scenarios. Okay? So some things
just bad once he's gotten here,

33
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:09,680
you know that he's not going to
make the payment the next period.

34
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,380
And let's suppose we further
assume that only does it,

35
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:15,770
not only does he default there,
but he defaults on everything thereafter.

36
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,790
So the payoff is just going to be
zero here. So this is going to be,

37
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,900
originally we had probabilities,
p one p two p three,

38
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:25,430
let's say for the probabilities.

39
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,730
Now we're going to have probabilities d
for default and then one minus d times

40
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:33,254
all of these,

41
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,290
right?

42
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,660
So essentially what have we done?

43
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,730
We've simply replaced in our calculation
of payoffs and present values,

44
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,910
we've simply replaced these possibilities
with probability p one p two p three

45
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,370
we added another possibility,
but the payoffs are zero here.

46
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,100
Nothing's going to happen
from then on except zero.

47
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,140
And we said that happened
with probability,

48
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,710
which means presumably all of these
have to be scaled down by that.

49
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:04,030
So they still add up to one.

50
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,800
So essentially the point I'm
trying to make is that default,

51
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,850
uh, that, uh, leads who

52
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,580
zero payoffs thereafter

53
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,930
after is just

54
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,890
like
discounting more.

55
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,430
Why is that?

56
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,960
Because whatever calculation you did for
the value here of what the bond could

57
00:03:38,961 --> 00:03:41,270
possibly be worth there is,

58
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,090
it's all the same numbers
as they were before,

59
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:48,650
except we've multiplied it by one
minus d. Okay. So it's the same thing.

60
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:53,390
So instead of going one over one plus
r times, you know, future payoffs,

61
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,220
that's no default value.

62
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,623
Hmm.

63
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,700
Okay. Now, so that time, suture payoffs,

64
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,770
now we've got the fault value
under this special kind of the fall

65
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:18,410
is going to be one minus d times one
over one plus r times the same future

66
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:23,150
payoffs.
Okay.

67
00:04:23,151 --> 00:04:24,470
But always could make one.

68
00:04:24,471 --> 00:04:29,471
I could rewrite one minus D as
one over one plus s or something.

69
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,860
And so then I really have just one over
one plus r times one over one plus s.

70
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,240
So that's just one over
one plus r Plus s plus s.

71
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:46,510
So that's going to equal one over one
plus r Plus s plus r s times future

72
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:50,894
values.

73
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,650
Okay, so the effect of this
special kind of default,

74
00:04:58,651 --> 00:05:01,920
we just get zero thereafter. You know,
the guy decides after this payment,

75
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:05,100
I'm not gonna make any more payments
on DePaul. The faulting from then on.

76
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,840
That's the same thing when
valuing the future payoffs.

77
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,870
It's the same thing as instead of
discounting by our discounting by r plus s

78
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,130
with a little bit. Our Times, as
you know, if rns are small numbers,

79
00:05:20,131 --> 00:05:21,780
this is probably quite a small number.

80
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:27,140
So default probabilities get mapped
into spreads that are called.

81
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,351
Okay.

82
00:05:31,351 --> 00:05:36,120
The Way to evaluate it is just you
just multiply it by one minus D,

83
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,480
which is the same thing as
discounting by a higher number.

84
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,240
And that a higher number
is almost the same.

85
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,570
It's very close to r plus
d as a matter of fact,

86
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,530
because one minus D is one of
one plus ass. If d is very small,

87
00:05:49,531 --> 00:05:51,570
s is going to be very close to d as well.

88
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:53,560
Okay.

89
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,380
Okay, so on Uproxx. Okay, so,

90
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,960
okay, so that, okay, so what's
the implication of this,

91
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:07,730
the implication of this in a special case,
special case,

92
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:12,050
again, where are we? We don't have,

93
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:15,740
we just have, you know, no one
certainty except we have default.

94
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,040
So here or there could be d one one minus
d one and here there could be probably

95
00:06:21,911 --> 00:06:26,911
living to fall two on one minus t two
probability of default three one minus d

96
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:32,420
three and we've got interest
rates are zero. So this will be,

97
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:33,723
um,

98
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:38,890
I zero I f one F two.

99
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,190
Okay. So if you knew what the
interest rate was going to be today,

100
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,290
you knew what the interest
rate was going to be tomorrow.

101
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,870
You knew what the interest rate was
going to be the day after tomorrow.

102
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,920
There no uncertainty about interest rates,
they're perfectly anticipated will,

103
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,360
but you know that there's a probability
of default each time. So in Stage one,

104
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,200
this guy might default before
making his payment here,

105
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,520
which case you're just going to get
zero. In Stage two, he might default,

106
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:09,030
instead of making this payment, won't
pay the coupon, he'll just default.

107
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,060
Or in year three he might default.
Okay.

108
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,290
So what's the implication
of what we just said? Um,

109
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,000
you can evaluate this bond.
The payoffs are the bond.

110
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:22,940
So let's say it pays off

111
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,310
coupon, c c a hundred plus city. Okay.

112
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,031
All right.

113
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:32,530
The way you would evaluate that without
the fault is you would just take

114
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,250
the value of the coupon.
The present value would have been one,

115
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:42,380
um, would have been, uh, you
would have done it recursively,

116
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:44,060
you would have gotten,
you know,

117
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:48,260
p three equals a hundred plus c,

118
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,670
then you would have said p two, it
would've gone. And your computer,

119
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,880
you're going to said p two is one over
one plus I f two times a hundred plus c.

120
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,250
Okay.
And then p won equals.

121
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:09,350
So the value here is the hundred plus
c discounted by that Ford, right?

122
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Then [inaudible] would have been c
plus p two divided by one plus I f one.

123
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,750
So you take the value here, time to that.
So this is in case there's no default,

124
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,930
and p zero would have been c plus
p one over one plus I f zero.

125
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,390
All right? So that's how you would
have done it by backward induction.

126
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,070
But now that you know,

127
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,030
chances, there's default. You have to,

128
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,480
you have to not multiply by one.
Plus I have to,

129
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,000
you have to multiply all the sides

130
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,210
things by the probability of default.

131
00:08:45,211 --> 00:08:47,760
You'd have to multiply this by,

132
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:50,550
if we change colors by one minus d,

133
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,500
You'd have to multiply this by one minus
d two and you'd have to multiply this

134
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:04,761
by one minus d one times one
minus d two and this by one minus,

135
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,210
uh, sorry, this would
be one minus d three.

136
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,630
This is one minus d three times d two
and this is one minus d one times one

137
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:21,540
minus d two friends,
one minus d three.

138
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,850
Okay.

139
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,211
Okay.

140
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:29,130
So this value would be the old value
got here multiplied by one minus d three

141
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:31,170
multiplied by this one,
minus d three.

142
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,400
This value is what you would've gotten
here, but you've already scaled it down.

143
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:39,450
So multiplied by one minus dean too.
And this is why one minus t one.

144
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,270
So what's the upshot?
The upshot is had you.

145
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,620
And so then this is okay. So that gives
you the price, uh, with the fault.

146
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,470
Okay.
So

147
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,213
Yup.

148
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,310
Well I could have done it two ways.
I could have written.

149
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:19,200
So what you're suggesting is a better
way would have been to say p two the

150
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:19,980
default,

151
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,980
the default fine p two is going to
be one minus d three times p three

152
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:34,050
okay. Which is also equal to p three
because there's no default after here,

153
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:39,051
the world just sends than p one is equal
to one minus d two times p two okay.

154
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:47,810
But that P to remember is already one
minus d three times a p three okay.

155
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:54,510
And then p zero

156
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:01,100
is going to be one minus d one times
one minus d two times p one but that's

157
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:04,890
equal to

158
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:11,390
one minus d one times one minus d two
times p one which is one minus the three

159
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,550
times p three

160
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,183
right?

161
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,950
Sorry. If you go from here to here,
the value here is a hundred plus c.

162
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,030
So if p three is just a hundred plus C,

163
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:32,031
that's leave it as 100 plus c
that's what the guy actually pays.

164
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,670
Okay.
So the present value would just be um oh.

165
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:42,230
Then you have to divide
all this by one plus I to,

166
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,041
sorry,

167
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:48,000
this is one plus I f two all making
a mess of this and this is a,

168
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,980
okay, so usually you'll go back
from here to here discounting by

169
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,480
the interest rate.
Okay?

170
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,840
But now we're going to have
to also multiply by the
probability that you default

171
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:00,970
to go back here.
So we get a lower number.

172
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:05,971
P two is not just a 100 plus c divided
by one plus I f that's the discounting.

173
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,670
You also have to multiply by
the probability of default.

174
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,500
Then when you go back one period further,
you have to discount again. Okay?

175
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:19,501
So I should have multiple divided this
by one plus I f one you have to discount

176
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:23,950
it and also you have to multiply it
by the probability of default. Okay?

177
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:24,650
But the thing you're,

178
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:28,030
you're bringing backwards is p two
which has already taken to account the

179
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,970
probability of default the next time.
Okay?

180
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:33,730
And then when you go
back one step further,

181
00:12:33,731 --> 00:12:38,731
you have to do the whole thing
again divided by one plus I f zero.

182
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,913
Okay.

183
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,470
I have one minus. This is p
one, not p two. So I have a,

184
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,720
okay.

185
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,290
No. Okay. So, but I'm switching the,

186
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,960
the peas on you. I've got a pee. Okay.

187
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:10,340
So when you have p when we go from here.
Okay.

188
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,080
You can, the value here, we just
calculated it was going to be p two. Okay.

189
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,041
So here,

190
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:21,041
the value of p one taking into account
the fault is one minus d two times p two.

191
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:27,080
Okay. Which already takes into
account that the fault next time. Um,

192
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:28,810
yeah,

193
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,300
thanks P to discounted by
the interest rate here.

194
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,440
So I've got the one minus d two here
now and I discount back to here.

195
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:38,680
You're saying how come the [inaudible]
showing up anymore? Cause I'm,

196
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,370
I'm just at the one that's your question.
Right. Okay. So it doesn't show up.

197
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:47,550
It's just a p zero is one minus
Dijuan oh you're asking this,

198
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:48,191
you're right.

199
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:52,870
One minus steam on you are
right times p one divided by

200
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,030
one plus I f zero.
That's right.

201
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,090
But if I plug in for p
one p one already had,

202
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,110
that's where the dean too came from.
So p ones got the deed to it.

203
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:09,130
So it's one minus d one times one minus
t two times p two and then p two had a p

204
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:13,690
three or it. So I've got all the
defaults in it. Are you with me now?

205
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:18,280
So sorry about that. So you're
right, I said it wrong. So, okay, so,

206
00:14:18,281 --> 00:14:20,920
but this is the point. This is Jay.
This was supposed to be obvious.

207
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:21,850
I didn't even think about it.

208
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,970
What I'm the next step is the
thing that's not obvious. Okay.

209
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,260
So to discount, you just figure
the here the potential cash flows,

210
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:30,820
you're discounting them
by the interest rate.

211
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:34,000
You also have to discount it again by
the fact that the guy might actually pay

212
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:36,190
you.
So that gives you a lower present value.

213
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:40,180
Pink to yellow p two is less than the,
no default,

214
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,790
quite p too.
When you discount again,

215
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,940
you're discounting the yellow
pea to by the interest rate here.

216
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:48,010
And also the fact that
the guy might not pay.

217
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:52,610
So you have to disk multiplied by one
minus t two and also the fact that he

218
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:56,270
might not pay the the
the forward. Right. Okay.

219
00:14:56,271 --> 00:15:00,140
And You keep moving that backwards.
Okay. So that was supposed to be obvious.

220
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,940
Even though I made it sound complicated,

221
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:10,550
what slightly subtler is just
saying the same thing backwards,

222
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:15,930
which is suppose that I,

223
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,063
um,

224
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:23,630
saying the same thing backwards is
suppose I knew all these forward rate

225
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,753
suppose.

226
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,773
Okay.

227
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,970
I knew the forward rate.
Suppose,

228
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,440
suppose I,
uh,

229
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,160
suppose I had a bunch of bonds.
So polls,

230
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,530
I had American bonds,

231
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,060
bonds, um, coupon bonds.

232
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,410
Okay. And so the American coupon
bonds are going to, are, you know,

233
00:15:56,411 --> 00:15:57,610
they're going to pay,
you know,

234
00:15:57,611 --> 00:16:02,611
the one year pays a coupon c one and
has a face of a hundred and has a price

235
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,043
high one.

236
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,030
The two year American bond has a coupon
seed to a face of a hundred and a price

237
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:10,960
of Pi two.

238
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,880
And let's say the five year has some
things see five phase of a hundred and the

239
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:20,860
price pie five. Okay. Now from
that we know that we can deduce,

240
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,880
you know what all the forwards are.
We did that in the first class.

241
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,820
Okay. So now suppose at the
same time we have Argentina,

242
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:40,780
were there many Argentine sovereign
bonds promise payments and dollars by the

243
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:43,220
way, they're trying to
trade them internationally.

244
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,980
So let's say Argentina,
we also have the Argentina bonds.

245
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:54,340
See Hat one a hundred pie hat one that's
the one year down to the five year,

246
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:02,710
which is the Argentina see had five a
hundred and p hat five by had five it's

247
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,250
price.
Now let's suppose that um,

248
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,120
Argentina could default
whereas America can't.

249
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:16,450
So it's quite likely that pie one will
be less than the American pie one and pie

250
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,660
five is going to be less than the
American pie five because all these bonds

251
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:24,840
might default. So if the coupons were the
same, if you see one hat was the saying,

252
00:17:24,841 --> 00:17:27,440
the c one and c five hat
was the same as [inaudible],

253
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,380
the fact that Argentina could default
obviously would mean it's bonds would

254
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:33,590
trade less for the American ones.
So the question is,

255
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:38,591
can you figure out the
default probabilities very
quickly in Argentina without

256
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:41,510
having to do a lot of
complicated calculations?

257
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:46,760
Well one thing you could do one
thing and the answer is yes.

258
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,700
And why is that? Because you could
take this data and you could say,

259
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:55,020
so we can just erase this here.
We could say assuming

260
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,660
no default,
um,

261
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,200
we could explain these prices.

262
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:07,883
Okay.

263
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,890
These prices by finding,
just like we did in America,

264
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,440
the Argentine Argentine forwards.

265
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:17,963
Okay.

266
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:23,030
Forwards one plus I hat zero one plus
I hat forward one and one plus I hat

267
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:31,020
forward for.

268
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,650
Okay,
so these are the Argentine forwards.

269
00:18:33,651 --> 00:18:37,520
Now these four words would be much
bigger than the American forwards.

270
00:18:37,521 --> 00:18:42,260
Why is that? Because the prices
in Argentina are so much lower.

271
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:46,820
If you're assuming there's no default
assuming no default contrary to fact,

272
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,530
how could you explain all these very
low prices where you must think that in

273
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:55,680
Argentina they've got very high
interest rates and very high forwards.

274
00:18:55,681 --> 00:19:00,050
So the discounting more and that's why
they've got lower prices and we know how

275
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:02,270
to get those forwards.
Assuming there was no default.

276
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:07,570
So the trick I'm merely pointing out
now is that if we now go back and say,

277
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:14,300
Aha, Argentina doesn't have different
Ford's because anyone in Argentina,

278
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,920
the bonds are denominated in dollars
precisely so that people can be crossover

279
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:22,910
investors and American can put his money
in Argentina or an Argentine can put

280
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:26,900
his money in America. So you can
move your money to either place.

281
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,380
So it must be that the forward
rates can't be different.

282
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,140
If you knew for sure you're
going to get paid in Argentina,

283
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,630
you'd have to have the
same Ford rates in America.

284
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,650
So the reason these forward rates are
higher is because there's a chance of

285
00:19:39,651 --> 00:19:43,940
default.
So what is the chance of default?

286
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,630
So I claim the chance of default is,
and I was supposedly,

287
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,340
you're supposed to realize this now,

288
00:19:49,341 --> 00:19:53,130
if I'd been clear before
you would have gotten it,

289
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,680
he would see where I'm going.

290
00:19:54,681 --> 00:19:57,320
The chance of default is
incredibly simple to find out.

291
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:02,120
So it's one minus d a t

292
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,560
equals what?

293
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:12,310
Okay. But in terms of Ford's
is what? It's not pie.

294
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,970
This pie, this isn't the zero price.
This is the big price of the bond.

295
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,670
So it's not pie hat t over piety.

296
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,140
What is it though?

297
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,383
So,

298
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,610
okay, this is going to be
a bigger number than that.

299
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,600
And the fact that ratio is
the default probability.

300
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,543
Okay,

301
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,160
so,
so this is assuming,

302
00:20:53,161 --> 00:20:57,990
remember that if the Argentine
bonds defaults at this period,

303
00:20:57,991 --> 00:21:00,480
say it's never going to
pay anything after that,

304
00:21:00,481 --> 00:21:02,850
you're going to get zero
payoff and all the other barns,

305
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,380
Argentine bonds will also default. I
claim that this is going to be the, uh,

306
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:10,950
this is the easy way of getting
the default probability.

307
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:16,230
And so the differences in the forwards
is just explain by the default

308
00:21:16,231 --> 00:21:19,680
probabilities.
And so the extra Argentine interest,

309
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:21,690
if this is a higher number than that,
you know,

310
00:21:21,691 --> 00:21:26,691
this is approximately one minus d is
approximately one over one plus the,

311
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,270
which is, and so it's basically, you know,

312
00:21:30,271 --> 00:21:33,840
this is very close to that.
Basically if d,

313
00:21:33,841 --> 00:21:36,600
if all the numbers are
IMB or small than I,

314
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:41,340
F t minus one is
approximately I f t minus one,

315
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:45,980
the American one plus this
default rate in Argentina. Okay.

316
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,870
So I should probably have a hat because
what I'm referring to Argentina with the

317
00:21:48,871 --> 00:21:49,704
hat.

318
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,633
Okay.

319
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,960
All right. So why is that
true? I just argued and how
could that possibly be true?

320
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,060
Okay. The week. Okay.

321
00:22:02,061 --> 00:22:06,050
So you see what I'm claiming that you
have now a very simple algorithm for

322
00:22:06,051 --> 00:22:10,640
finding out, inferring what Argentina
default rates are. You can just,

323
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,460
again, I'm making a special assumption
that when Argentina defaults,

324
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,790
you get nothing.
That really isn't the case.

325
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:20,270
There's some huge convention that happens
in all the countries get together.

326
00:22:20,271 --> 00:22:22,910
They defaulted on,
they've got some big meeting and you know,

327
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,630
someone like Brady invents some idea will,

328
00:22:25,631 --> 00:22:29,150
they'll old less than there'll be a
writing down of principle by the way.

329
00:22:29,151 --> 00:22:30,500
So whenever this happens,

330
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:34,430
there is recovery is recovery,

331
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,950
uh, after, uh, writing down of principal.

332
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,310
Okay? So what all the
countries do as they say, okay,

333
00:22:43,311 --> 00:22:47,000
we know you can't pay all that you owe us,
we'll settle for half of it.

334
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,690
We'll write down the principle and we'll
hold you to that half or to a third of

335
00:22:50,691 --> 00:22:51,560
it.
Okay.

336
00:22:51,561 --> 00:22:54,980
And so this is one of the
things we curiously haven't
done in America where all

337
00:22:54,981 --> 00:22:58,400
these homeowners can't pay and we
don't write down their principle.

338
00:22:58,401 --> 00:23:00,320
We just throw them out of their houses.
But anyway,

339
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:04,370
let's say you wrote the principle
down to zero and that special case,

340
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,620
you could easily infer from the price
of the Argentine bonds what the default

341
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:14,000
probabilities were and by this formula.
And so the question is why is that true?

342
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:21,730
Okay? We know how to calculate
the forwards and America
given the American data.

343
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,560
That was one of the first
things we did in class.

344
00:23:23,561 --> 00:23:28,300
We said that every American company in
the whole country financial company is

345
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:32,500
doing that. Everybody has those
four words calculated. Okay? Now,

346
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:34,150
if you give them the Argentine data,

347
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,390
which is after all just coupons
and the prices of the bonds,

348
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,570
you could find Argentine forwards
assuming there's no default.

349
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:45,080
But that of course, but, but, but there
is the fault. So it must be that they,

350
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,320
there are, they have access to the
American interest rates and forwards.

351
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,720
But the Argentine mine bond might default.

352
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,420
But you see what we did when
we did this calculation,

353
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,920
the difference between the backward
induction in America from here to here was

354
00:23:57,921 --> 00:24:01,910
just discounting by the American forward.
Okay.

355
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,320
To go to Argentina,

356
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:07,850
we had to discount by the American
Ford and multiplied by one minus d.

357
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:11,570
So discounting it again.
So all I'm saying is that in the u s one,

358
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:12,590
we went backwards.

359
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:17,830
We just discounted by
this thing in Argentina,

360
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:22,160
when you go backwards, you have
to discount, buy this thing.

361
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,913
Okay?

362
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,330
So those things have to be the same.

363
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,160
Okay? So the Argentinian discount
is like taking the, uh, um,

364
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,170
I hope I haven't got the thing,
see,

365
00:24:44,171 --> 00:24:46,690
the American Ford's is going to
be less than the Argentine Ford's.

366
00:24:46,691 --> 00:24:47,524
It's going to be like that.

367
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,063
Okay?

368
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,570
Okay. So that's it.
There's nothing to, uh,

369
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,820
else to show except that whenever
you're going backwards here,

370
00:24:56,821 --> 00:25:01,650
you're discounting. Remember
you're discounting by the,
uh, you know, the, the,

371
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:05,370
the interest rate times the probability
that you're actually going to pay off.

372
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,390
And so that's what it is in a Argentina.

373
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,010
Um,
hang on.

374
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,480
Hope have an inverted one of these.
Uh,

375
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,613
okay.

376
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,730
Yeah,
exactly.

377
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:28,450
So if you write one minus d times the
American thing in the denominator.

378
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:32,260
So as I said to to, to do the disc
carrying in Argentina at every step,

379
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,140
going back from here to here,
what did we do in Argentina?

380
00:25:35,141 --> 00:25:40,141
We simply took one minus d that was
the default rate hat in Argentina and

381
00:25:40,721 --> 00:25:43,060
discounting it at the American forward.

382
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:49,690
Okay? So that's what I did here.
So if I take one minus d hat,

383
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,690
you know,
multiplied by one.

384
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,950
So I take one minus t hat
multiplied by one over this. Okay?

385
00:25:56,951 --> 00:26:01,090
I just get one over the Argentine
discount and that's how we calculated.

386
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:06,040
That's how we went backwards with our
recursion. Just taking the interest rate,

387
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:11,190
the discount one over one plus I times
one minus d and that's how we discounted

388
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,620
going backwards.
And so therefore in Argentina,

389
00:26:14,621 --> 00:26:17,320
if you're forgetting that there's default
and you're just thinking you have to

390
00:26:17,321 --> 00:26:19,840
discount at the right rate and
you're getting this discount,

391
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,280
you're getting this number.

392
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:24,550
But in reality you should have
been taking this divided by that.

393
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,290
So therefore figuring out this and knowing
that tells you what this has to be.

394
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:33,880
So it's extremely simple to
deduce what the market thinks.

395
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:37,720
Argentinian default
probabilities are year by year.

396
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,180
If you make the ad to the
assumption that once they default,

397
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,350
they default completely.

398
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,590
And if you think you're only
going to get a little bit back,

399
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,070
well then the calculation won't
change that much. Okay. Yeah.

400
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,970
Yeah. So you could also do it
by using the price of Zeros,

401
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,770
but to me the best thing is the,
the easiest thing is using the forwards,

402
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:03,270
but you can also do it by zero. Okay. So
that's all I wanted to say. All right,

403
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:05,370
so and, and, and as I said,

404
00:27:05,371 --> 00:27:09,600
the one last thing to say is that
if these numbers are all small,

405
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:14,780
then one minus one over one minus D or
one minus d one minus D is approximately

406
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:19,530
equal to one over one plus d.
Okay.

407
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:24,210
That's if d is very small, those are
practically the same things. And then,

408
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,780
you know, if you multiply one over
one plus d by One over one plus I,

409
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:32,670
it's almost one over one plus d plus Psi.
So it's almost this thing,

410
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,530
it's not quite true,
literally true.

411
00:27:34,531 --> 00:27:39,090
But it's very close to say that the
gap between Argentinian forwards and

412
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:44,091
American Fords is just
the default probability in
Argentina and that that reason

413
00:27:45,421 --> 00:27:48,510
is why it's called a default spread.
Okay.

414
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:51,690
You just add some spread to the
interest rate and you've pretty even,

415
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,600
so you can guess by the spread
what the probability of default is.

416
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,480
If it's a 6% interest
there and a 3% interest,

417
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,630
you know if the 8% interest
there in 3% interest here,

418
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:05,130
somebody must think the probability
of default is 5% there. That's it.

419
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,403
Okay,

420
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:14,340
so let's now move to a tree
where you have to make decisions.

421
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:20,590
So I'm going to now describe the
method of backward induction,

422
00:28:20,591 --> 00:28:23,620
which occurs over and over and over again.

423
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:28,300
And we've used it a couple times,
but not in its subtlest form.

424
00:28:28,301 --> 00:28:32,860
So backward induction,
a backward induction.

425
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,910
Okay. Now who first invented the
idea of backward induction? Well,

426
00:28:36,911 --> 00:28:41,911
the first person who spelled
it out formally was Armello
who's a in 1910 I think

427
00:28:43,601 --> 00:28:45,040
that's within a couple of years,

428
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:48,490
a famous mathematician
Frankel's or mallow axioms.

429
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,550
And he proved that chess,

430
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,800
that there is an optimal strategy.

431
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,770
There is an optimal strategy

432
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:03,130
strategy in chess by backward induction.

433
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,750
Okay? So for example, let's take a game.

434
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,820
So we always are on a tree,

435
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:18,110
but now we're going to use a slightly
extended definition of a tree.

436
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,500
A tree is going to look
like this, you know, there.

437
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:24,020
So it's a root finite number
of branches from every,

438
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,530
I want to formally define a tree. You
know what it sort of looks like. Okay.

439
00:29:27,531 --> 00:29:30,560
And there's no reason why the number of
branches has to be two or even has to be

440
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:35,120
the same from every point. But the
reason we're going to extend it is the,

441
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,780
the node is going to be described,
is going to describe by who moves.

442
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,720
So let's say white is moving here
and black is moving here. You know,

443
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:47,890
let's say the outcomes
are a win for white.

444
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:53,380
I win for black,
a draw or a draw.

445
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:57,580
Okay, so the question is, so
it's a to move chess game,

446
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,560
white moves first up or down. Then after
white moves, black moves up or down,

447
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,220
and then the gay man's,
and depending on where position you reach,

448
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,910
either it's a win for wide, a
win, win for black or a draw.

449
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:14,470
So what should white do?
Assuming that black is a smart player,

450
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:18,550
what should she do
so clearly?

451
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,800
Um, so what did Zur mellow do? He said,
not only there's an optimal strategy,

452
00:30:23,801 --> 00:30:27,040
but you know what the outcomes
should be with rational players.

453
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,610
So as [inaudible] said,
if white goes up, okay,

454
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,970
then black is clearly going
to go down and win the game.

455
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,580
So white ought to be thinking here,

456
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:41,620
if I go up the game of it won't end
for another period. It's already lost.

457
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,770
So the value of the game is already zero.
Okay?

458
00:30:44,771 --> 00:30:48,370
So this method of backward
induction attaches the value here.

459
00:30:48,371 --> 00:30:52,210
We have values at the end,
okay?

460
00:30:52,211 --> 00:30:55,600
And so to figure out what the right
thing to do is buy backward induction,

461
00:30:55,601 --> 00:30:59,920
you can propagate the values backwards.
If black makes the right choice here,

462
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,820
but you know the, the payoff is
black gets the negative of white.

463
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:08,940
So the right choices here are a black
could get negative one or could get zero.

464
00:31:09,071 --> 00:31:13,510
So black clearly wants to get zero. So
black could win the game by moving down.

465
00:31:13,511 --> 00:31:14,980
So black,
surely we'll move down.

466
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:18,880
So I should think of the game is already
lost here and pretend that I had a

467
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:23,650
shorter tree with the final valuation
of zero at this node. Similarly,

468
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,730
if white goes down, it doesn't
matter what black does, uh,

469
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,340
the game is going to be drawn.
So quite should think to himself,

470
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:35,050
the game is already a draw. If I go
down and now white has an easy choice,

471
00:31:35,051 --> 00:31:39,940
do I want to move to a loss or do I want
to move to a draw so clearly white so I

472
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:41,830
could,
I could just pick a move for black year.

473
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,910
Clearly white is going to go down
and therefore with correct play,

474
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:50,800
the game is a draw. So by
backward induction, you
figure out the correct play.

475
00:31:50,801 --> 00:31:55,000
Now why is this surprising?
Because chess has an incredibly big tree,

476
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:58,090
not an infinite tree. You know, there
are all these rules that keep it finite.

477
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:02,650
If you reached the same position
three times, it's considered a draw.

478
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,820
If you make something like 50 moves in
a row without upon moving, it's a draw.

479
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:11,350
Whatever those rules are. I used to play
chess quite a bit, I've even forgotten.

480
00:32:11,351 --> 00:32:13,900
But whenever those rules are,
they're designed to make the game finite.

481
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:18,901
So the tree is finite and so it's
impossible to see the whole tree.

482
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,730
And how should you know
what to do at the beginning,

483
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,170
but you don't know what to
do at the beginning too.

484
00:32:23,171 --> 00:32:25,750
You know what blacks going
to do afterwards and to
what could happen later in

485
00:32:25,751 --> 00:32:29,770
the tree. But if you were fast enough
to put the whole thing on a computer,

486
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,790
you could figure out what to do at the
beginning because your best move at the

487
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:36,070
beginning depends on what you
think black is going to do next,

488
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:38,560
which depends on what he thinks
you're going to do after that,

489
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:41,840
which depends what you think he'll
do after that. But if the tree ends,

490
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:45,140
you can always go backwards from the end
to the beginning and figure out what to

491
00:32:45,141 --> 00:32:49,100
do at the very beginning. Okay. So this
is a familiar argument to all of you.

492
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:51,860
I think it was a beautiful argument in,
um,

493
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:57,810
in chess in 1910 and then it
was anticipated, I mean, in,

494
00:32:57,811 --> 00:33:02,400
in mathematics in 1910, the chess players
of course, all knew about it. So Stein,

495
00:33:02,401 --> 00:33:03,234
it,

496
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:08,290
who was a world champion from when
to when something like 1870 or so,

497
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:12,500
two or 1880,

498
00:33:12,501 --> 00:33:17,480
let's say to let's say 1921 to 1894,

499
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,021
I think it was,

500
00:33:18,021 --> 00:33:21,230
world champion from then to their
Lasker became the champion then.

501
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:26,030
So he wrote a bunch of books and
stuff in which he said, you know,

502
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,120
there's a backward
induction value to chess,

503
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,140
but since we can't figure that
out on general principles,

504
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:36,110
you can tell by looking at
the configuration of pieces,

505
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:41,240
what the right possible move
is. And so you can, you can
have positional, you know,

506
00:33:41,241 --> 00:33:44,480
you can have positional, uh, values.

507
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:49,790
So I'll do that. And then you can
have the backward induction values.

508
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:55,340
So for instance, a puddle positional
value might tell you that, uh, you know,

509
00:33:55,341 --> 00:33:58,400
having a doubled ponds is a bad thing.

510
00:33:58,401 --> 00:34:01,520
Having control of the center's a good
thing and you add up all those pluses and

511
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:05,420
minuses and you'd get these
positional values. And so, um,

512
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:10,190
he said your positional, you know, if
you've got the right positional, uh,

513
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:14,390
algorithm, right, positional
understanding, your positional
sense of what to do,

514
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,090
you only need to analyze one move deep.

515
00:34:17,091 --> 00:34:20,360
You can figure out what the best
positions going to be and move that way.

516
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,570
And if we really understand the game
properly, that positional thinking,

517
00:34:23,571 --> 00:34:24,980
that strategic thinking.

518
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:30,340
So let's call the strategic thinking is
going to give you the same decision as

519
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:34,650
the exhaustive analysis of all the
possibilities, which is tactical thinking.

520
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:36,780
Okay,

521
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,180
okay. So the two should
amount to the same thing.

522
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,870
Now in fact people can't do
the full tactical thing and
also they don't have the

523
00:34:42,871 --> 00:34:44,610
full strategic understanding either.

524
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,540
So they kind of mixed strategy and
tactics and that's what makes the game

525
00:34:48,541 --> 00:34:50,190
interesting.
So no one has ever written this,

526
00:34:50,191 --> 00:34:54,210
but I'm sure there's an interesting
study to be made about what games are

527
00:34:54,211 --> 00:34:57,570
interesting and they must be the
kinds of games where you can mix.

528
00:34:57,571 --> 00:34:59,280
There's always a mixture of strategy.

529
00:34:59,281 --> 00:35:02,700
And tactics in game theory as
we describe it and economics,

530
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,340
there's no such thing as strategy.
All of this is out.

531
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,240
It's all just backward induction,
which is what I'm teaching you. Um,

532
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,720
so the way computers play
chess incidentally is,

533
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:17,380
and the guy who invented this is Shannon.
Uh,

534
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,650
so he's a famous

535
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,363
mmm.

536
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:25,660
You know,
a famous professor of information systems.

537
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:30,760
So an engineering professor.
So he, he said, well, you
can't look at the whole tree,

538
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:33,160
which is too long in chess.
So what you should do.

539
00:35:33,161 --> 00:35:37,440
So all of this extends way further.
Maybe you can only look to moves deep.

540
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:42,330
So what Shannon recommend is look as
far as you can put it in your computer,

541
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:47,570
apply some positional thinking to evaluate
these positions at the pseudo end of

542
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:51,240
the tree.
So it's really not a win for white,

543
00:35:51,241 --> 00:35:54,840
let's just pretend white so far ahead
that we'll call it a win and a loss and a

544
00:35:54,841 --> 00:35:56,490
draw on the draw.
You know,

545
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:59,910
that's just my looking at positional
values and then having a sign those

546
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:02,880
terminal nodes values.
Now by backward induction,

547
00:36:02,881 --> 00:36:06,660
you can figure out what the value is here
and exactly what the right first move

548
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:10,050
to make is. And then after whites
move, black will come here.

549
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:11,730
Black can now look to moves deep.

550
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:15,270
So blacks going to look from
here all the way down here.

551
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,950
He's going to do is positional evaluator
to these nodes and try and figure out

552
00:36:19,951 --> 00:36:23,020
what they're worth and then do backward
induction to figure out what his right

553
00:36:23,021 --> 00:36:26,580
move is. Anyway, that's basically
the idea of all chess algorithms.

554
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,460
And then they've gotten refined by saying,

555
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,100
why don't we throw lots of refinements?
So I used to be very interested in this.

556
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:34,920
I don't think I'll talk more about it
unless anyone wants to ask me something.

557
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:39,570
So there's the origin of backward
inductions are mellows, uh,

558
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,970
proof and uh,
you know,

559
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:44,940
it's obviously a big deal in chess and
the chess players all knew about it

560
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:47,100
before as a Merrill low,
but they didn't write anything down.

561
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:48,210
His formulas are mellow.

562
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,670
So how does this apply to
everything we do in economics? Why?

563
00:36:52,671 --> 00:36:57,671
I want to give a series of examples
culminating in market examples,

564
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:01,290
but starting off a little far from life.

565
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:05,520
So the first one I want to
give is the red and the black.

566
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,630
So then there's just two games. This is
the first one I invented 10 years ago,

567
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:16,860
but I don't think there's any way.
I think there they aren't that original.

568
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:19,710
I thought they were when I invented them.
But anyway, so the red and the black,

569
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,820
it works like this. There's
a deck of cards, 52 cards,

570
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:29,700
deck of 52 cards
and you can um,

571
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:34,200
someone offers you. So half
of them are 26 read, right?

572
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:35,340
And 26 black,

573
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:39,300
which is all I care about the cards and
someone offers you a game and they say,

574
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,230
okay, the decks upside
down, they've been shuffled.

575
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,020
You can turn over a
card and if it's black,

576
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,800
I'll pay you a dollar if it's red
and you have to pay me a dollar.

577
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:54,690
So I'm offering you this chance
to play this game. And of course,

578
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:58,950
um, you know, you can quit whenever you
want to. I can't keep forcing you to play.

579
00:37:58,951 --> 00:38:03,440
So anytime you want to, you can
quit. So that's the game. Uh,

580
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,470
can stop

581
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,680
whenever you want.
Okay?

582
00:38:11,681 --> 00:38:14,740
And once you drove a car and
you throw it away. And so I'm,

583
00:38:14,741 --> 00:38:18,610
all these examples are going to
be examples of stopping games.

584
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,520
And you'll see an economics that,
you know,

585
00:38:21,521 --> 00:38:25,660
when you prepay on a mortgage
or when you call a bond,

586
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,620
you're stopping the thing. The contract's
ending. I mean, your life is going on,

587
00:38:29,621 --> 00:38:31,000
but that contract is ending.

588
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:34,990
So want to know when's the right time
to take an action like that. So red,

589
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:39,310
black is a simple game like that
where you turn over a card, you,

590
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:43,000
if it's black, you're in the black,
you win a dollar. If it's red,

591
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:47,770
you lose a dollar and you can stop
whenever you want. So you have an option.

592
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,480
So I call this an option

593
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:56,260
and most people totally
underestimate the value of options.

594
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:00,640
So let's just figure out how to
figure out the optimal thing to do.

595
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:04,480
What would you do in this game? Would you
play if I gave you the chance to play?

596
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:09,490
I think we did this on the very first
day. Yes. You're about to say something.

597
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,740
Your hand twitched. I thought, yeah,

598
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,720
I was going to say.

599
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:33,530
Okay, so we're, I'm not, I'm going
to now disagree with what you said,

600
00:39:33,531 --> 00:39:36,170
but it's very interesting
what he said. He said, look,

601
00:39:36,171 --> 00:39:39,260
if you draw a card at the beginning,
it's 50 50.

602
00:39:39,261 --> 00:39:42,800
Whether you're going to win or not. If
you win, you get a dollar. If you lose,

603
00:39:42,801 --> 00:39:45,860
you lose a dollar 50 50 chance.
You know,

604
00:39:45,861 --> 00:39:49,460
if you're a little bit afraid of if a
full dollar loss is more important to you

605
00:39:49,461 --> 00:39:53,660
than a dollar game, that's a bad, you
don't have that, that's the right away.

606
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:58,220
It's not very good. Uh, not very good
odds. I mean, it's barely even. Okay.

607
00:39:58,221 --> 00:40:01,970
And if you're a little bit risk averse
and it's barely even, you shouldn't play.

608
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:07,520
Okay, but now is it really
barely even this game? Yep.

609
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,300
You should play it because even point

610
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,083
you might as well,

611
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:25,310
right? So you can't possibly
lose, if you play this right,

612
00:40:25,311 --> 00:40:28,700
you can always go to the very end of
the deck. We're ignoring, you know,

613
00:40:28,701 --> 00:40:31,100
good point.
We're ignoring your utility of time.

614
00:40:31,101 --> 00:40:34,250
She can always go to the end of the
deck and assure yourself of zero.

615
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:38,840
So this is actually a pretty valuable
option to be able to stop. Like he says,

616
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:41,990
you can stop. Uh, if
the first one's black,

617
00:40:41,991 --> 00:40:43,940
you could stop and then
you've won a dollar.

618
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:47,330
If the f a whole bunch of them are red
and you lose while you can always go to

619
00:40:47,331 --> 00:40:50,180
the end of the deck and get zero so
you're never going to lose and you have a

620
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:54,080
chance of winning. So obviously you should
play. Even if you are risk averse, um,

621
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:58,250
you should play. And, but now the
question is, can we tell exactly?

622
00:40:58,251 --> 00:41:02,150
Suppose your risk neutral,
how many dollars do you expect to win?

623
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,100
Okay.

624
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,933
Would you guess?

625
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,453
Yup.

626
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:14,430
You'd expect to get zero.
Okay.

627
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:17,940
Now he just made an argument that you
should expect more than zero because for

628
00:41:17,941 --> 00:41:22,890
instance, he said, take this
strategy, pick a card. If it's black,

629
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,600
you went into all or quit. You're a
dollar. I had. So with 50% of the chime,

630
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,690
you're plus a dollar.
If it's red the first time,

631
00:41:30,691 --> 00:41:33,830
just close your eyes and play to the
end of the game and you're going to get

632
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:37,430
zero because you're going to
win 26 times and lose 26 times.

633
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:40,220
So that's equal to 0.5.

634
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:44,000
So there's one strategy that
gets you 50 cents on average,

635
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,430
you can't lose and half the
time you'll get a dollar.

636
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,860
But that may not be the best strategy.
Yup.

637
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:03,990
Right. Okay. So he's saying, you
know, this is an ambitious enough,

638
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,480
this surely gets half a dollar,
but you could do much better.

639
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,950
Like let's just wait. You know, the
first time, suppose you get a dollar,

640
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:14,970
suppose you get black the first time.
So that gives you a dollar.

641
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:20,300
Now the trouble is the deck is starting
to turn against you now it's 25 blacks

642
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:24,750
in 26 reds.
So what would you do then?

643
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:28,850
You'd stop or keep going.

644
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:31,580
Okay,

645
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,530
well the, the, the deck is against you.

646
00:42:33,531 --> 00:42:38,270
So now your very next draw is unfavorable.
And by the way,

647
00:42:38,271 --> 00:42:41,390
playing till the end of the deck is going
to lose you a dollar because they're

648
00:42:41,391 --> 00:42:44,120
25 black and 26 red.

649
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:46,160
So this argument that if you just
played at the end of the deck,

650
00:42:46,161 --> 00:42:46,970
you'll break even.

651
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:50,600
It's not true after you've already taken
a black one out so you could lose it.

652
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:53,870
You know from that on, you're starting
to run a little bit of a risk.

653
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:57,290
So we're ignoring risk aversion,
we're just caring about expected dollars.

654
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:01,100
The fact is the deck is against you,
so should you play or not?

655
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:05,660
And so a first reaction is,
hell no, the Dex against me,

656
00:43:05,661 --> 00:43:07,040
why should I draw another card?

657
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:10,310
But you still have the option
of going to the end of the deck.

658
00:43:10,311 --> 00:43:12,620
So the most you could lose is a dollar.

659
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,960
If he went all the way to the
end of the deck. And who knows?

660
00:43:14,961 --> 00:43:18,650
Maybe you'll get a run of more black
cards in the beginning and make a lot more

661
00:43:18,651 --> 00:43:23,360
than a dollar. Okay, so you
should choose another card.

662
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:27,980
Okay. In which case if you get black
again, if you've got red on the next card,

663
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:30,710
you'd be breaking even.
But now it's 24 20 sorry,

664
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:33,560
25 25 and by the previous argument,

665
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:36,440
it's obvious you should pick another one
because the worst you can do is break

666
00:43:36,441 --> 00:43:39,530
even from then.
But what if you got two blacks in a row?

667
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,860
Well now the deck is way against you.

668
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:47,920
It's 26 red and 24 black.
So your,

669
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:49,940
you know,

670
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:54,110
now you've only got a 48%
chance of drawing a black
when the next time the deck

671
00:43:54,111 --> 00:43:58,340
is going further against you.
Should you really draw another black card?

672
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:01,760
It seems another card, it's, you
know, it's more likely to be read.

673
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,580
Well the answer is yes.

674
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:07,520
And suppose you got a black one again,

675
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
meaning your three up and
now the deck is 26 23 sorry,

676
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:16,550
I went the other way. 26 red, 23 black.

677
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:21,110
It's getting further and further against
you. Should you draw another card? Well,

678
00:44:21,111 --> 00:44:26,111
what you've got is you've got
a bad deck working against you,

679
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:29,960
but you've got this option
or working in favor of you.

680
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,270
So the question is how valuable
is the option? And Mike,

681
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:37,740
I said people always underestimate
the value of options. And so,

682
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:39,540
okay,
go ahead.

683
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:42,250
Option A,

684
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:46,160
is there any loose condition is a either
bounced out or worse than your wind

685
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:47,003
conditions?

686
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:49,020
Yes.
But what is that condition?

687
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:49,983
13 months

688
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:54,890
you would take, you would, if
you got 10 blacks in a row,

689
00:44:54,891 --> 00:44:57,350
you would keep drawing blacks.
Is that what you're saying?

690
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,570
Well, I mean at that point, if
you see that, that's awesome.

691
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:04,770
I'm assuming that you just pick another
red and then put up the end of the game.

692
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,340
You could lose, uh, would it be

693
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:08,910
13 more?

694
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,830
So you're saying you want to keep drawing
blacks until if you played till the

695
00:45:13,831 --> 00:45:17,070
end of the deck, you would lose as
much as you'd want up until that point.

696
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:22,530
So you want are never run the risk of
losing money, of losing more. Okay.

697
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:25,500
Do you see that strategy would get
you to quit after the first one?

698
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:30,030
After the first black, if he ran to
the end of the day, uh, you know,

699
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,600
your strategy doesn't make sense.
You're always going to,

700
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,840
by going to the end of the deck,

701
00:45:33,841 --> 00:45:36,990
you're always going to undo everything
you've won until that point because

702
00:45:36,991 --> 00:45:39,360
you'll be zero no matter what.
If he'd go to the end of the deck,

703
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:44,120
yeah, she did. You quit.

704
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:49,320
Whenever you have more black cars,

705
00:45:49,341 --> 00:45:53,450
their red card number of black cars

706
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:56,110
dec is less

707
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,030
number red.

708
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,000
Yes.

709
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,930
Whenever we do have one dog,

710
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,990
no,
that's it.

711
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:06,920
So he's saying just the
common sensical thing.

712
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,470
After you draw one black card,

713
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:12,440
he would quit because now
the deck is against you.

714
00:46:12,441 --> 00:46:16,910
It's 25 red and only 25 black.
The dex against you.

715
00:46:16,911 --> 00:46:19,910
Why go on and play against
an unfavorable deck.

716
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:24,350
You've got your dollar be satisfied
and quit. That's his recommendation.

717
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:29,240
But that's wrong. And it's because
you're doing what everybody does.

718
00:46:29,241 --> 00:46:31,310
You underestimate the option.

719
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:36,410
The option is incredibly valuable here
and now I just want to show how to

720
00:46:36,411 --> 00:46:41,180
compute what your optimal strategy
is and I think you'll be surprised.

721
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:46,160
Okay, you should keep drawing. Not three
times if he got a fourth black card.

722
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:50,720
Okay, so you've already made $4. It's a
sunk cost. You've got this horrible deck.

723
00:46:50,721 --> 00:46:55,640
It's 26, 22. Should you keep
playing? Yes you should. Yes you can.

724
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:00,020
If you've got,
if you get a fifth black card in a row,

725
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:03,740
you're up $5.
The deck is horribly against you.

726
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,970
Should you keep playing? Yes,
you should. So anyway, um,

727
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:09,890
it's really shocking, I think. Okay,

728
00:47:09,891 --> 00:47:14,210
so now let's just see how to compute
this out so that we don't have to argue

729
00:47:14,211 --> 00:47:14,631
about it.

730
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:19,550
It's just a little bit of mathematics
and you just see how a surprising this

731
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:21,890
calculation is.
So how would you do it?

732
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,990
Okay, well, the key is to figure
out how to put it into a tree.

733
00:47:36,991 --> 00:47:40,350
So I'm not going to draw a picture
because it gets too complicated,

734
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:44,580
but basically what you want
to know is how valuable.

735
00:47:44,581 --> 00:47:46,500
Remember the tree in backward induction?
It was.

736
00:47:46,501 --> 00:47:51,501
Take the thing at the end and then figure
out at the beach by propagating the

737
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:52,950
values backwards.

738
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:58,190
So if I have black and red here and I've
got one black card and no red cards,

739
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:03,000
the value to me of that is what

740
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,360
I'm going to win a dollar for sure.

741
00:48:06,361 --> 00:48:09,480
If there's only one black card
left in the deck and no red cards,

742
00:48:09,481 --> 00:48:11,610
I know I'm going to play to
the end and get a dollar.

743
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:16,670
And obviously the value of two black
cards, no red cards is $2 et cetera.

744
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:21,890
And I also know what's the
value to me of no black cards.

745
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:24,570
And one if I know that there are no black,
you know,

746
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:26,730
you know what every stage
what's left in the deck.

747
00:48:26,731 --> 00:48:28,920
Cause you've seen what came up before.
So if they're,

748
00:48:28,921 --> 00:48:32,610
if you're at the very end of the deck
with no black cards and one red card,

749
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:34,770
what's the value of that position to you?

750
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:40,410
Zero not minus one zero.
Why is that?

751
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:44,580
Because you're going to quit.
You're not going to play the value.

752
00:48:44,581 --> 00:48:47,550
And that's the critical step
seeing that this is zero. Okay.

753
00:48:47,551 --> 00:48:51,240
Someone said minus one that
difference between zero and minus one.

754
00:48:51,241 --> 00:48:54,090
That's the whole heart of
the thing. So zero one, two,

755
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:57,390
the value of that is also zero.
You're just going to quit. Okay.

756
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,410
So what in general is the value?

757
00:49:01,411 --> 00:49:06,411
What is the value of v if there
be black cards and our red cards?

758
00:49:06,421 --> 00:49:09,660
What's the value to you?
Well,

759
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:16,610
crucial step is that you can
choose to quit by not playing.

760
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:20,250
So this is the value from
then on to you be, you know,

761
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:23,190
so be black cards left for red.
Our red cards left.

762
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,690
You could get zero by quitting.
Okay. Or You could draw a card.

763
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,910
Now what happens to
you if you draw a card?

764
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:34,620
What happens to you if you draw a card?
Well,

765
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:39,920
with probability be over being plus art.

766
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,650
You win a dollar,
right?

767
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:48,330
But then you move on to the new deck.

768
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,520
And so what do I write?
V here?

769
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:55,140
V of B minus one.

770
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,753
And are,

771
00:49:58,540 --> 00:49:59,373
okay.

772
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,090
Okay.

773
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:05,090
But with probability are Overby.

774
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:10,110
Plus are you drew a red card.
So it's minus one,

775
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:13,950
but then you move on to a deck
that has one less red card

776
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:21,263
and that's it.

777
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:26,670
You either decide to stop or
if you've decided to draw a,

778
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:30,080
you know what the chances
of getting a black card are.

779
00:50:30,081 --> 00:50:35,010
You look at the black cards, 26
out of, you know, if I'm, I'm,

780
00:50:35,011 --> 00:50:38,630
I'm down there,
it's 21 out of 47 sounds horrible.

781
00:50:38,631 --> 00:50:41,330
21 out of 47 I win a dollar.

782
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:46,040
26 out of 47 I lose a dollar.
So the immediate draw is terrible.

783
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,350
But if I get a black card,

784
00:50:48,351 --> 00:50:53,060
I moved to this situation and if I get
a red card, I moved to this situation.

785
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,320
Okay. So that's clearly, okay.

786
00:50:57,321 --> 00:51:00,140
So do you agree with me that that's
what the value is going to be?

787
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:01,070
And so if you look at,

788
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:08,550
okay, so now, okay, is there any
questions? This is a critical formula.

789
00:51:08,551 --> 00:51:10,200
How critical spot does everyone,

790
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:14,430
it's Sophia be here now in trouble.

791
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:18,360
Somebody came and said hello to me
after class and now I know her name.

792
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,430
So just this formula makes sense.

793
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:22,423
Yeah.

794
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:27,300
Kathleen? Yes. Is it Katherine
or Kathleen? Catherine. Okay.

795
00:51:27,301 --> 00:51:30,480
Catherine, you, you, so you agree
with this formula, right? Okay.

796
00:51:30,481 --> 00:51:33,480
But this formula is the
key is just like our tree.

797
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,880
Once you know what the
values are down here,

798
00:51:35,881 --> 00:51:40,020
you can always go backwards and
figure out the value here. Okay. So,

799
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,410
um, uh, you know,

800
00:51:43,411 --> 00:51:47,310
so what is the tree the tree's going to
have? Well, I'm going to draw it on a,

801
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,700
I'll do it on a computer.
So now he can just do the sonic computer.

802
00:51:59,070 --> 00:51:59,903
MMM.

803
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:02,380
I hope I don't have to do that.

804
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:09,160
Okay, so you have this
by the way, and your, uh,

805
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,870
it's on the web.
Oh No.

806
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:20,320
Why are all these, okay, the red
question mark. Okay, so here it is.

807
00:52:20,321 --> 00:52:23,590
So you can see that on,
on this.

808
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:27,550
I can do it with this on this thing.
It's, by the way, this was, uh, uh,

809
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:32,610
I did my own spreadsheet
and an undergraduate last
year thought it was so messy

810
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,750
that a, she just, we did it
for me. So this is her doing,

811
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:41,680
it looks much better than I did. So
anyway, here are the number of cards.

812
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:44,620
This is what the number
of black cards left.

813
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:49,090
This is the number of red cards left.
And the, and then when you go to the,

814
00:52:49,091 --> 00:52:51,610
you know, the corresponding
coordinate like this one,

815
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:54,700
this is the value of the game.

816
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,060
When you have one black card
and one red card, it's a fee.

817
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:01,690
Even though there's an even deck, it's
a favorable gain to you. Why is that?

818
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:05,490
Because you draw the first card. If it's
black, which happens with probability,

819
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:09,550
50% you win a dollar. So you've
got half a dollar. If it's red,

820
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:13,270
which happens with a 50% probability,
you can draw the next one.

821
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:16,480
And so you end up with zero. And by the
way, if he got a black the first time,

822
00:53:16,481 --> 00:53:17,350
obviously you stop.

823
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,760
So you get 50% chance of a dollar and
stopping or 50% chance of going to the end

824
00:53:21,761 --> 00:53:26,250
and getting nothing. So it's value 50%
but that's a bad way of that number.

825
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:29,280
She's got a much better way
of calculating it. Okay?

826
00:53:29,281 --> 00:53:33,180
So what she said is if this is
the, uh, if you had, you know,

827
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:35,460
no red cards and only black cards,

828
00:53:35,461 --> 00:53:39,000
the value is to go to the end of the
deck and just win them all. Okay.

829
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:43,980
So if you've got only red cards in the
deck and the top line is no black cards,

830
00:53:43,981 --> 00:53:45,270
obviously you should quit right away.

831
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:48,720
So we've got this first
thing trivially done.

832
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:52,800
Now how do you figure out this thing?
Well, if you look at the formula up there,

833
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:55,860
it's just the formula you
wrote, okay? We wrote,

834
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:59,940
which is you could quit if he wanted to.
So you have to take the Max of zero.

835
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,210
But if you go on and draw,
I can't read what's written there.

836
00:54:03,211 --> 00:54:06,300
If you go on and draw, there's
is going to be, you know,

837
00:54:06,301 --> 00:54:09,240
the probability of red,
okay?

838
00:54:09,241 --> 00:54:12,840
This is the probability of getting a
read over the total number of cards.

839
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,930
Times losing a dollar,
okay?

840
00:54:15,931 --> 00:54:19,380
Plus what happens is you then move.
If you do red,

841
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,800
then you go to,
um

842
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:28,790
Oh,
what did she do?

843
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:37,460
C four we're almost seeing forest
here, okay? Right? So, sorry,

844
00:54:37,461 --> 00:54:40,970
I was getting confused with the car.
And so c four is this squared. Okay?

845
00:54:40,971 --> 00:54:43,160
That's the value in here.
So see forces,

846
00:54:43,161 --> 00:54:46,490
if you draw a red card the first time
it happens with this probability,

847
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:48,890
the number of reds over
the total number of cards,

848
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:53,210
you lose a dollar and then you move to
the position c four which is one back

849
00:54:53,211 --> 00:54:57,320
here, the one where you've got one less
red card and just the black card left.

850
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:01,040
Okay. On the other hand, you could have
drawn the first time, not the red one,

851
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:04,250
but the black one. Okay. Divided
by the total number of cards.

852
00:55:04,251 --> 00:55:05,420
And he would have won a dollar,

853
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:09,020
but then you would have
moved to the position where
you had one last black card,

854
00:55:09,021 --> 00:55:13,850
which is d three which is up here. Okay?
So instead of doing the whole game,

855
00:55:13,851 --> 00:55:17,480
she says half the time you win
and are half the time you win.

856
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:19,640
But then you move over to
here and get that value.

857
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:23,480
Half the time you lose and
then you lose a dollar.

858
00:55:23,481 --> 00:55:25,850
And when you move over to here.
So she's done that.

859
00:55:25,851 --> 00:55:30,260
That same formula appears in every box.
So all you had to do with just copy it,

860
00:55:30,261 --> 00:55:31,730
you know it's Max's and euro.

861
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:34,250
And then the chance that
you're going to lose a dollar,

862
00:55:34,251 --> 00:55:36,570
which is the number here
of red over the total,

863
00:55:36,571 --> 00:55:39,710
it's times minus a dollar
and then moving over to here.

864
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:44,270
Or You could get the probability of
winning a dollar with the black cards and

865
00:55:44,271 --> 00:55:46,590
then, but then you would end up
see when a dollar and then even,

866
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:48,410
but then you move up to here.
Okay,

867
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:53,150
so it's very simple now the, okay, so, so,

868
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:57,610
okay, so she's done it and notice that
all of Overdeck is even at one party each.

869
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,690
So it sounds like a fair game.
It's not.

870
00:55:59,691 --> 00:56:02,960
It's a favorable game because you have
an option. So you all understood that.

871
00:56:02,961 --> 00:56:05,900
But the thing is the option is
much more valuable than you think.

872
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,830
So let's see what the value of a game is.
Okay?

873
00:56:09,831 --> 00:56:14,210
It's when you had 26 black
cards and 26 red cards.

874
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,010
We have to go way over here.

875
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:19,750
Here.
Sorry.

876
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,040
Where am I going?
Not the right answer.

877
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:24,671
Okay,
here it is.

878
00:56:24,671 --> 00:56:29,671
26 26 the value of the game is
$2.60 not just half a dollar.

879
00:56:29,711 --> 00:56:33,130
You wanted to quit wherever
you are at half a dollar.

880
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:35,830
It's not looking up anymore.
So you want,

881
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:40,870
so you wanted to quit with a hat. You
don't have to the first draw, okay?

882
00:56:40,871 --> 00:56:42,400
But it's much better than that.

883
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:46,470
So now what the shocking
thing though is so poll.

884
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:51,010
So this means with 26, 26 you can, you
have a favorable gaming, you should draw.

885
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:54,160
If you didn't draw it, be worth zero. So
obviously you're supposed to draw here.

886
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:58,030
If you get a black card, you're going
to go here. So hearing your down,

887
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:01,870
you've gotten a card and you've
got one more. Uh, you know,

888
00:57:01,871 --> 00:57:05,530
it wasn't that likely you're going to
get black. But if you did 50% chance,

889
00:57:05,531 --> 00:57:09,730
you go here. So you win a dollar and
now you're at this position. Now,

890
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,850
if you were supposed to stop,
you would have a,

891
00:57:12,851 --> 00:57:15,910
if you're supposed to stop at that point,
what would you have done?

892
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:20,620
If you're supposed to stop at that point,
you would have had value zero.

893
00:57:20,621 --> 00:57:23,050
So the fact that that number
is positive is telling you,

894
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,070
even when the deck is against you,
25 you can't see it.

895
00:57:27,071 --> 00:57:31,960
It's 25 blacks and only and still 26 reds.
It's still a favorable game.

896
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:35,410
You should draw a card and if by
some miracle you want a dollar,

897
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:40,240
you would have moved to here.
So now you're 26 red in 24 black,

898
00:57:40,241 --> 00:57:44,380
but the game is still
favorable. You should draw
another dollar. Another, sorry,

899
00:57:44,381 --> 00:57:48,340
another card. Okay. And if you win again,
you're here. Now you've gone one, two,

900
00:57:48,341 --> 00:57:49,151
three times.

901
00:57:49,151 --> 00:57:52,810
You've drawn blacks and you should still
draw another one four times getting

902
00:57:52,811 --> 00:57:54,490
blacks.
You should still draw another one,

903
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:58,060
five consecutive black draws the card.

904
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:01,990
The deck is now 26 against
you and 21 in your favor.

905
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:06,230
You should draw again, the game is
still slightly favorable. And uh,

906
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:08,500
it just seems shocking.
That could be the case,

907
00:58:08,501 --> 00:58:11,830
but this is the proof that it's the case.
So anyway,

908
00:58:11,831 --> 00:58:16,720
that illustrates the power of the option
of being able to continue. And if we,

909
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:17,710
and if you work,

910
00:58:17,711 --> 00:58:21,430
you're going to work out low numbers
two and three in the homework,

911
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:25,510
and then you'll see very clearly why it
is that this option is just so powerful.

912
00:58:25,511 --> 00:58:29,170
It's uncannily strong. So there
are any questions about this? Yes.

913
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,250
Um,
I'm still a little bit confused.

914
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:36,620
I didn't know that the ocean by those
probabilities guys pretty is a little bit

915
00:58:36,621 --> 00:58:40,640
against you, especially
when you, after five weeks,

916
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:44,890
why do one another?
Yes.

917
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:50,060
The option by that is a little bit
about it. Let's do it again. Yeah.

918
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,990
This isn't the option value and
this is the value of plain. Okay.

919
00:58:53,991 --> 00:58:58,910
So it says the option value is bigger
than the more important than the fact that

920
00:58:58,911 --> 00:59:01,160
the cards are against you.
So he's asking,

921
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:04,160
my ta is asking

922
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:11,260
how could it possibly be that the deck
is now 26 red in 21 black totally against

923
00:59:12,051 --> 00:59:15,470
you. And according to this
calculation, you should still draw.

924
00:59:15,471 --> 00:59:19,400
He can't see the advantage in drawing
because the odds are pretty high.

925
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:23,240
You're going to get a red card
time. Okay, well that's true.

926
00:59:23,241 --> 00:59:26,120
You're going to get a red card next time.
But the thing is,

927
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:30,500
your downside is limited. You can never,
here's a way of thinking about it.

928
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:33,830
You can never,
you're up five cards.

929
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:38,630
You can never lose more than $5 from
that point on because you can always play

930
00:59:38,631 --> 00:59:41,850
to the end of the deck,
right? Which means you, you,

931
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:45,950
you lose the five back that you
already won. So there's a downside.

932
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:49,340
The downside of losing is
limited. Here. On the other hand,

933
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:54,110
there's a big upside to you. You
might by some miracle draw, um,

934
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:58,880
10 consecutive black ones at that
point, and then you could quit. Okay?

935
00:59:58,881 --> 01:00:02,150
And then you'd have a big, so your upside
is much bigger than your downside. Now,

936
01:00:02,151 --> 01:00:05,780
the upsides less probable than the
downside. So it's not so obvious,

937
01:00:05,781 --> 01:00:06,890
which is going to be bigger.

938
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:10,460
Is the option value more important or
is the fact that the deck is against you

939
01:00:10,461 --> 01:00:13,460
more important? It would be
impossible to intuit the answer,

940
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,980
but we don't have to intuit it.
We just proved it.

941
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:18,350
We've solved for the optimal strategy.

942
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,910
Are there any other questions? It's
quite amazing, right? This, uh,

943
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:27,030
okay.

944
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:28,470
I'm going to pause for a second.
Yes.

945
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:35,790
Okay. That's what we just
did. So let's try it again.

946
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:47,930
Okay.
So what we did this,

947
01:00:47,931 --> 01:00:52,931
number V is the expected profit you're
going to make if you start with B black

948
01:00:54,501 --> 01:00:56,270
cards and our red cards.

949
01:00:56,570 --> 01:01:01,570
And now the intuitive mind figures
that if B is less than our,

950
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:07,340
you've got an unfavorable deck
and you should just quit. Okay?

951
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:10,670
But that's not the case.
You can figure out what the profit is,

952
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:12,590
how by doing backward induction,

953
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:16,100
you couldn't tell what the value of this
bond is here with all these defaults

954
01:01:16,101 --> 01:01:19,340
and stuff until you started computing
backwards till you got to here.

955
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:20,840
So the same way here,

956
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:25,340
we know at the edges it's very obvious
when all the cards are black or all the

957
01:01:25,341 --> 01:01:29,810
cards or, or a red that's up here.
It's obvious what the value is.

958
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:31,820
But if you have a position here,

959
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:35,960
you can figure out what the value is of
being in that position of one and one.

960
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:38,210
You could quit and be zero.
Or You could say,

961
01:01:38,211 --> 01:01:41,540
what am I chances of getting a black card
and winning a dollar if I get a black

962
01:01:41,541 --> 01:01:43,760
card,
then I moved to this position,

963
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:47,090
but I already figured out this
position's value cause I'm doing backward

964
01:01:47,091 --> 01:01:51,410
induction. Right? That's got one less,
um, sorry. If I draw a black card,

965
01:01:51,411 --> 01:01:54,920
I go this way, it's got one less black
card and we already know that valley,

966
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:58,040
that position is zero. So to figure
out the value of this position,

967
01:01:58,070 --> 01:02:00,200
I know the chance of getting a black card.

968
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:03,740
Then I'm going to end up in that
position, which is value zero. Okay,

969
01:02:03,741 --> 01:02:08,741
I won't draw anymore or I'm going to get
a red card and then I'm going to move

970
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:12,530
to this position over here. Who's
value I've already computed. Okay,

971
01:02:12,531 --> 01:02:16,040
so that gives me the value here.
How do I figure out the value here?

972
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:20,850
Well it's now two reds and one black,
so this looks really bad.

973
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:25,650
Actually, this position, the value of
this I happen to know is zero. Okay?

974
01:02:25,651 --> 01:02:28,530
How could it be with two red
cards and only one black card?

975
01:02:28,531 --> 01:02:31,530
Actually the value of the position
is zero. Well, what do I do?

976
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:36,450
The chances of getting a black card
the first time or a third. So via one,

977
01:02:36,451 --> 01:02:39,090
two is going to be a third.
Okay.

978
01:02:39,091 --> 01:02:42,060
I'm getting a black card
plus then I go to here,

979
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:45,630
which is no black cards left
and just red cards. Okay.

980
01:02:45,631 --> 01:02:50,460
Which obviously is zero plus two thirds.
Okay.

981
01:02:50,461 --> 01:02:53,340
Two thirds of the time I get
a red card and lose a dollar.

982
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:57,510
But then I'm going to move to here with
one red card where I have v of one and

983
01:02:57,511 --> 01:02:59,850
one which I've already figured
out the answer to. Right.

984
01:02:59,851 --> 01:03:04,680
This was v of one and one
has value a half. Okay.

985
01:03:04,681 --> 01:03:09,210
So therefore we have one and two is going
to be two thirds times minus one plus

986
01:03:09,211 --> 01:03:14,040
v of one to write. I just drew
a black card. So it's no longer,

987
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:17,770
no, I drew a red card,
so it's one and one.

988
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:21,880
So I started with one black and two reds.
A third of the time I get a black card.

989
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:26,010
Two thirds of the Times I get a red card.
But after getting the red card,

990
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:29,800
the position is now one black and
one red or red card disappeared.

991
01:03:29,801 --> 01:03:33,250
That's over here. Okay, so you
get a black card. I moved to here.

992
01:03:33,251 --> 01:03:35,500
We know what if I get a red card,
I moved to there.

993
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,690
But v of one lawn is worth a half.

994
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:42,720
So that's equal to one third times one
plus zero plus two thirds imes minus one

995
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:48,460
plus a half.
Okay?

996
01:03:48,461 --> 01:03:52,990
Which equals one third minus one third,
which equals zero.

997
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:55,900
Okay?
So starting at this point,

998
01:03:57,340 --> 01:04:00,910
you've got one red card and two black
cards. It looks horrible to pick a card.

999
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:03,670
Two thirds of the time you're
going to get the wrong card,

1000
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:08,770
but you're still have a position that's
actually equal in value because if you

1001
01:04:08,771 --> 01:04:13,690
get that a black card, which wins,
you stop. If you get a red card,

1002
01:04:13,691 --> 01:04:16,960
you're now in a position that's equal
deck and the deck is fee that's favorable

1003
01:04:16,961 --> 01:04:19,690
for you because if you get
another black card, you stop.

1004
01:04:19,691 --> 01:04:23,950
And if you get a red card, you keep
playing until the end. Okay? So, um,

1005
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:29,410
uh, okay. So that's it. So how can
you do this by backward induction?

1006
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:31,940
You have the stuff on
the edges and then you,

1007
01:04:31,941 --> 01:04:36,280
you solve for all these things along
the side here. And having done that,

1008
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:40,120
now I can solve for this one cause I've
got up into the left and I do that whole

1009
01:04:40,121 --> 01:04:40,780
row.

1010
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:44,140
Then I can do this whole row and then I
can just do I back introduction to the

1011
01:04:44,141 --> 01:04:47,380
whole, you know, the whole thing.
And the computer does that instantly.

1012
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:51,400
So it figures out the value of every
single node and it's shocking with the

1013
01:04:51,401 --> 01:04:53,680
answer is so there any
other questions about this?

1014
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:57,483
Hm,

1015
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:04,920
Ben, you, so I,

1016
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:08,780
I tell you initially taking
care about it as well. I imagine

1017
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,480
you stay till the end for,

1018
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:17,320
you could choose to play in this game
and after your wing are you living,

1019
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:18,010
then you'll

1020
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:22,150
get the option that's continue with
the game as a separate that option.

1021
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:28,570
Well that is your option. The option is
always to keep playing or to stop. Okay.

1022
01:05:28,571 --> 01:05:31,780
So let's, let's just do, and
with the value I wrote down,

1023
01:05:31,781 --> 01:05:36,430
is the value of the game to you of being
able to play the whole game however you

1024
01:05:36,431 --> 01:05:40,030
want. Okay, so now let's do the,

1025
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:42,520
let's do another example.
Yes.

1026
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:51,670
Right?
So if you got it,

1027
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:52,680
is that,
my question is,

1028
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:56,170
is it preference to risk or is
it actually the rationality?

1029
01:05:56,620 --> 01:06:01,120
Right. So this is going to
become very important very
shortly. So his question is,

1030
01:06:01,121 --> 01:06:04,570
I just proved, you know, if you
can call that approved by computer,

1031
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:08,620
the computer proved that even
if you got five blacks in a row,

1032
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:10,450
you should still draw another card.

1033
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:15,190
Of course things are quite
risky now because you know
there's a very good chance

1034
01:06:15,191 --> 01:06:17,020
you're going to lose
on that very next card.

1035
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:20,950
So he's saying if you're risk averse,
maybe you would stop there.

1036
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:25,120
And how can you distinguish somebody
who's risk averse from someone who's just

1037
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:28,750
dumb and can't make the calculation?
So we have to,

1038
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:32,410
so that's going to be a question we're
going to take up in the very next class.

1039
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:37,030
But I would say that it's usually because
people are dumb and can't make the

1040
01:06:37,031 --> 01:06:40,570
calculation.
So they just don't realize how valuable,

1041
01:06:40,571 --> 01:06:44,290
how favorable the situation is they're
in by having this option to be able to

1042
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:47,650
play to the end of it, to stop
when they want to stop. Okay.

1043
01:06:47,651 --> 01:06:52,480
So let's just do one more example.
Suppose that you,

1044
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:53,403
um,

1045
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:58,800
suppose that you are undergraduates
and you want to get married.

1046
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:02,980
You've been told that's
a good idea and you,

1047
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:07,360
it's going to be very a sexist thing.
But anyways, also a game I invented,

1048
01:07:07,361 --> 01:07:08,710
which turned out not to be

1049
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:10,683
okay.

1050
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:16,110
As original as I thought. Uh, so I
call this the optimal marriage problem.

1051
01:07:16,530 --> 01:07:17,363
So,

1052
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:18,680
okay.

1053
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:23,180
So let's say you knew you were going to
meet a thousand women. You're taking,

1054
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,860
telling him from the guy's point of view,

1055
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:27,080
okay,

1056
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:30,170
you're going to meet a thousand women.
Okay.

1057
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:35,171
1,000 women and each woman
you meet her suitability.

1058
01:07:37,371 --> 01:07:41,660
You can't tell until you meet her and
talk to her. And after you meet her, uh,

1059
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,600
each woman's suitability,
each suitability

1060
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:50,170
is he uniform lead distributed

1061
01:07:52,850 --> 01:07:57,590
on zero one. Okay. So what do I mean by
that? I mean you meet or you talk to her,

1062
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:01,340
you get to know her and then you
just draw, you know, and so when you,

1063
01:08:01,341 --> 01:08:02,121
before you met her,

1064
01:08:02,121 --> 01:08:05,270
you have no idea how suitable she's
going to be after you've talked to her,

1065
01:08:05,271 --> 01:08:09,260
you understand how suitable the best is.
It's one the worst at zero.

1066
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,590
And it could be a draw anywhere between
zero and one before you meet her.

1067
01:08:12,591 --> 01:08:14,420
You have no idea.
After you meet her,

1068
01:08:14,421 --> 01:08:17,810
you know exactly suitable
she is and they're going to
be a thousand of them that

1069
01:08:17,811 --> 01:08:19,370
you're going to meet.
You couldn't meet.

1070
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:25,400
Like the problem is that after you've
talked to him and you can marry her then,

1071
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:28,220
or if you move on

1072
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:38,570
or you can move on, but once you've
moved on, you can never go back to her.

1073
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:42,410
So the question is, um, so
you understand the problem.

1074
01:08:42,411 --> 01:08:47,060
The problem is that let's say the first
woman is 0.95 or 0.9. Oh you think,

1075
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:49,790
Gosh, how suitable this is
a great match. But you know,

1076
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:53,810
I've got 999 more women to go.
Maybe I'll do better.

1077
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:56,510
And then you get Zeros from then on.

1078
01:08:57,020 --> 01:09:00,230
And so you've missed your 0.9
and so you're not going to,

1079
01:09:00,231 --> 01:09:03,380
you're going to end up marrying the
last one who's maybe a zero for you.

1080
01:09:03,381 --> 01:09:05,740
That doesn't mean she's a
zero just for you. A zero. So

1081
01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:14,090
I trying anyways.
Okay,

1082
01:09:14,091 --> 01:09:18,950
so what should your optimal strategy be
and are you playing the optimal strategy?

1083
01:09:18,951 --> 01:09:23,300
So what do you think? You know, just
intuitively, what's the optimal strategy?

1084
01:09:23,301 --> 01:09:25,400
Of course we're going to do
it by backward induction,

1085
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:29,450
but what do you think it's going to
look like? The optimal strategy. Yes.

1086
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:32,550
Yeah.

1087
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:35,790
Right. That is the actual,
that's what's going to happen.

1088
01:09:35,791 --> 01:09:40,050
We're going to prove this, but
he's, he's exactly picked, he said,

1089
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:43,020
you set a threshold here at the beginning.
You know,

1090
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:45,630
you'll marry her if
she's above some number.

1091
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:49,050
You keep to that threshold for a while
and you haven't married anyone. You'd say,

1092
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:52,380
Oh my God, I'm running out of women. And
then you're in standards just collapse.

1093
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:57,330
Okay. So it's best for
patients. That's it.

1094
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:00,300
Okay.
So that's absolutely right.

1095
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:04,920
But the only interesting
thing is to figure out how
high the standard should be.

1096
01:10:04,921 --> 01:10:07,230
So how high do you think
it is at the beginning?

1097
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:08,770
Okay,

1098
01:10:08,770 --> 01:10:10,840
what would you say the
number is at the beginning?

1099
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,100
Okay.

1100
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:17,720
Okay. Now let me give you a
hint. Uh, if you divide up.

1101
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:21,860
Okay, so there's, here's one
and there's a thousand women.

1102
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:25,130
So here's zero, okay? So
they're randomly picked.

1103
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:30,280
So if you could look at all the women
and see and pick out the most suitable

1104
01:10:30,891 --> 01:10:35,300
one, what would her suitability
be? Well, her suitability would be,

1105
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,490
um,
her suitability.

1106
01:10:37,491 --> 01:10:42,491
So top the top on average will
be something like a thousand,

1107
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:47,900
over 1,001. Okay? This
is a famous problem.

1108
01:10:47,901 --> 01:10:52,820
If you take and people randomly,
uh, you know, you take any numbers,

1109
01:10:52,821 --> 01:10:55,130
you pick random when
uniformly in zero one,

1110
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:59,060
the top one on average is going to be,
if there's a thousand women,

1111
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:01,940
it's a thousand over a thousand.
One second top,

1112
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:06,080
he's going to be 999 over 1,001.

1113
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:11,380
So this very standard statistical
result actually was derived by a,

1114
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:17,340
by a former professor and World War II.
The Americans captured German tanks,

1115
01:11:17,341 --> 01:11:20,760
which had all their serial
numbers on them. And uh, you know,

1116
01:11:20,761 --> 01:11:23,850
they see the first tank was number one,
the second tank was number two.

1117
01:11:23,851 --> 01:11:27,240
The third tank they made was number three.
So we captured a bunch of them.

1118
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:31,130
And then we had to guess how many
tanks did they make. Anyhow, so the,

1119
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:32,820
so it's related to this,
uh,

1120
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:36,890
to this idea that if the
uniformly distributed on
zero one the top one's going

1121
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:40,530
to be on average a thousand or
1,001, nine 99 or 1001, et cetera.

1122
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:42,900
But now you've seen, so, okay, so where,

1123
01:11:42,901 --> 01:11:46,890
what standard would you set
for the first one? Right?

1124
01:11:46,891 --> 01:11:50,820
You have to set some threshold
here. You know, here's one,

1125
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:54,720
and here's zero. By the end
you'll take any, you know,

1126
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:57,870
but the last woman you've got, you're
going to take her no matter what. So what,

1127
01:11:57,871 --> 01:12:01,980
uh, what should the threshold
be? Well, it's hard to tell.

1128
01:12:01,981 --> 01:12:04,830
We can't do it except by backward
induction. So what would you guess?

1129
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:07,023
Awesome.

1130
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,940
One we're then you'll
never take or if it's one,

1131
01:12:08,941 --> 01:12:12,990
because the odds of getting exactly
one r zero. So what would you guess?

1132
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:14,843
Huh?

1133
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:20,020
So you'd set the threshold this high,
a thousand over 1,001.

1134
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:24,340
Okay. So that means you're
expecting to get as good a woman is.

1135
01:12:24,341 --> 01:12:26,410
If you could go to the very
end and look at all of them,

1136
01:12:26,411 --> 01:12:29,380
you never make a mistake. I told you
there's a chance you'll make a mistake.

1137
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:30,790
The first one's the best.

1138
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:33,430
It doesn't quite come to your threshold
and all the rest of their worst.

1139
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:37,670
Then you end up with a disaster here. So
you know you, you, you, you know, so you,

1140
01:12:37,671 --> 01:12:39,880
you have a chance of not
doing that once your,

1141
01:12:39,881 --> 01:12:42,820
you're setting to highest standard here
cause you have a very good chance of

1142
01:12:42,821 --> 01:12:46,930
saying no to all these women and then
ending up with what's you right. Okay.

1143
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,530
However you're on the right track.
So amazingly,

1144
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:55,180
this is the answer. This
is the threshold. Okay?

1145
01:12:55,181 --> 01:13:00,181
So you should set the threshold at where
you expect the second highest woman to

1146
01:13:00,881 --> 01:13:03,220
be second highest match to be.

1147
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:07,510
And that is why there's so many
novels about the other woman.

1148
01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:09,760
Because if you're playing optimally,

1149
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:13,150
you should be ending up with the second
best woman and there should be one other

1150
01:13:13,151 --> 01:13:16,780
woman that at the end of your life you
regret that you didn't wait for and,

1151
01:13:16,781 --> 01:13:20,720
but only one other
woman. So anyway, I just,

1152
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:25,810
I just want to prove this to you in
the same way we proved it before,

1153
01:13:25,811 --> 01:13:29,050
just by solving for backward
induction for the optimal.

1154
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:32,920
So we can just do this by
backward induction. We know
exactly what to do. Okay?

1155
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:36,070
So I, you know, it's one thing
to say what you should do.

1156
01:13:36,071 --> 01:13:37,960
It's another thing to prove.
That's what you should do.

1157
01:13:37,961 --> 01:13:41,350
And I'm going to prove it now. So you
can just see by backward induction how,

1158
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:47,680
how easy it is to do these things.
Okay. So it's only, you know,

1159
01:13:47,681 --> 01:13:50,800
I'm going to have to take four minutes.
If you can hang out for four minutes,

1160
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:54,730
we'll get this.
So what happens with two women left?

1161
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:58,960
What's v of to
what should you do?

1162
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:03,790
What should your threshold be for two,
what is your threshold be?

1163
01:14:03,791 --> 01:14:08,590
For two women. So here's the
threshold and we have two and three.

1164
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,071
Okay?

1165
01:14:09,071 --> 01:14:14,071
So I'll tell you threshold for one
threshold for one woman is zero.

1166
01:14:15,071 --> 01:14:19,060
If it's the last woman there, you know,
you w w whatever she is, she's, you know,

1167
01:14:19,061 --> 01:14:19,600
it's,
that's it.

1168
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,480
You're going to might as well marry or
it's only going to can't be negative.

1169
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,460
Okay?
And then the value

1170
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:30,520
I'm carotid is the value of one
is going to be a half, right?

1171
01:14:30,521 --> 01:14:33,220
Because if there's one woman left,
you're going to take her no matter what.

1172
01:14:33,221 --> 01:14:35,860
And on average you'll get a half.
So the question is now,

1173
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:40,600
what's the threshold when they're two
women left and what's your expected

1174
01:14:40,601 --> 01:14:43,270
payoffs? So what's the threshold
if they're two women left,

1175
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:46,270
you'll see the second to last woman,
you talk to her,

1176
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:51,190
you find out how good the matches you
should take her if she's above the matches

1177
01:14:51,191 --> 01:14:56,010
above what? No, there was
only one woman left after her.

1178
01:14:56,011 --> 01:14:56,844
So

1179
01:14:57,070 --> 01:14:57,903
good.

1180
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:01,480
So I have right,
because if you don't take her,

1181
01:15:01,481 --> 01:15:04,120
you're going to go to the last woman
on average, you're going to get a half.

1182
01:15:04,121 --> 01:15:07,780
So there's no point in taking someone
who's match is less than a half.

1183
01:15:07,781 --> 01:15:10,180
When the break, next step, you are an
average, you're going to get a half.

1184
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:15,490
So your threshold is a half. So what's
your expected quality of the match? Well,

1185
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,890
with probability a half you get,

1186
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:22,060
you make you with probability a half,
she's going to be above a half.

1187
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:26,560
And if she's above a half, she's going
to be halfway between one and a half.

1188
01:15:26,561 --> 01:15:29,980
So it's three quarters. And
with probability, uh, sorry,

1189
01:15:29,981 --> 01:15:32,170
this end with probability a half,

1190
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:37,650
she's going to be below a half and
you're going to pass on her and go to the

1191
01:15:37,931 --> 01:15:40,750
last one and it'll be on average a half.
Okay,

1192
01:15:40,751 --> 01:15:45,250
so this is three A's loss. Um, no,

1193
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:49,930
probably the half. She's going to be
three quarters and probability a half,

1194
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:54,400
she'll be a half. So three A's was
one quarter is five eighths. Okay.

1195
01:15:54,401 --> 01:15:55,720
Now what if there were three women,

1196
01:15:55,960 --> 01:16:00,490
what should the threshold be for three
women and what's the value of three?

1197
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:07,120
Okay, so the threshold should be v
of two, which is five eighths. Okay.

1198
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,820
And what's the value?
The value is going to be,

1199
01:16:09,821 --> 01:16:13,570
what's the chance that you take
the one you just meet? Well,

1200
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:17,020
the odds that she's above a
half is three A's. So it's three

1201
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:23,800
times the average of one and you know,
halfway between.

1202
01:16:23,801 --> 01:16:26,680
So she's above five days. So she's
somewhere between one in five days.

1203
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:32,040
So that's going to be a one plus five
days over to Kate plus five ace of the

1204
01:16:34,001 --> 01:16:37,570
time you pass on her and
then you get five A's.

1205
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:42,460
So that equals if we just do that in a
little bit more generally it's one minus

1206
01:16:42,461 --> 01:16:45,160
V two.
Okay.

1207
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:50,460
So that's one minus v two times one
Plus v two divided by two plus V of two

1208
01:16:57,550 --> 01:16:59,560
times.
Um,

1209
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:00,950
we have to,

1210
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:07,170
okay, so that's what the pro,
that's the formula. So for any,

1211
01:17:07,171 --> 01:17:09,500
so in general v of t hey,

1212
01:17:09,501 --> 01:17:12,500
you set the threshold at v of t minus one.

1213
01:17:12,501 --> 01:17:17,501
So with probability V of t minus one
you're going to get one plus v of t minus

1214
01:17:17,961 --> 01:17:22,310
one divided by two and
with probability one minus,

1215
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,400
um no.

1216
01:17:24,401 --> 01:17:29,401
This is one minus V of t minus one with
probability V of t minus one you're

1217
01:17:30,411 --> 01:17:33,500
going to get, you're going to pass
on her and go to the next thing.

1218
01:17:33,501 --> 01:17:37,070
So you get just v of t minus one.
Okay? So that's just a formula.

1219
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:40,220
V of t equals some function
of v of t minus one.

1220
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:44,240
So you can program that into a computer,
which is ending.

1221
01:17:44,241 --> 01:17:48,350
Now with this one picture, that's the
end of it. Sorry, I know I've gone over,

1222
01:17:48,351 --> 01:17:52,850
but this is the last picture and only
take a second. So zero yield curve.

1223
01:17:52,851 --> 01:17:55,190
Optimal marriage. Okay, so here it is.

1224
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:59,630
Here's with one woman your
your value. Oh Shit. Sorry.

1225
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:06,830
With one woman,
the value is a half one match to go.

1226
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:20,750
Okay? So the number on the
left is with one match to go.

1227
01:18:20,751 --> 01:18:24,230
The valley's a half with two.
It's five days with three.

1228
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:28,100
We computed that too. So you can
tell for however many women you want.

1229
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:32,900
Now what I've done on the right
number is this, and plus one over.

1230
01:18:32,901 --> 01:18:36,920
It's an over n plus n minus
one of rent plus one. Okay?

1231
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:40,610
So that's the second best woman.
How how good she'd be on average for you.

1232
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:42,320
And as you go down further and further,

1233
01:18:42,321 --> 01:18:45,640
you see these numbers are getting
to be the same. So this number,

1234
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:48,860
this number is practically the same.
And if you go down to the very bottom,

1235
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:52,460
you'll see they're identical,
okay?

1236
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:56,420
Up to an incredible number of decimal
places. You get the, the, the,

1237
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:59,060
these two numbers are the same.
So if there are enough women,

1238
01:18:59,061 --> 01:19:01,430
you're going to hear,
get exactly the second best,

1239
01:19:01,431 --> 01:19:03,290
and it's going to be the problem
with the other one. But anyway,

1240
01:19:03,291 --> 01:19:07,130
the point of all this was to just
illustrate how powerful the option is.

1241
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:11,090
It's as if you could go to the very
end and pick out the second best one,

1242
01:19:11,091 --> 01:19:13,280
even though you have to
do them sequentially.
