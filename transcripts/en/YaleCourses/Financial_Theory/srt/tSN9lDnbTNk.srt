1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:05,960
Anyhow, so today I'm going to
try and wrap up a few loose ends.

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,090
So,
uh,

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:11,840
I'm going to try and talk about
the high watermark of finance,

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,610
which is basically cap
Bam and black shoals,

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,190
both of which we've almost talked about,
almost finished talking about.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,470
And I'm going to talk in the
middle about social security,

7
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:28,700
which we never finished.

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,730
My social security plan is I hope to deal
with all three of these things today.

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,200
So just to wrap up the cap m,
the cap M had two main ideas.

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,290
The first idea was diversification.

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,610
And the second main idea,
as we said,

12
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:50,880
was the trade off between risk and return.

13
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,080
Okay.

14
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,240
Shakespeare had both of these ideas.

15
00:00:55,241 --> 00:00:58,810
He understood that you're safer if he's
got each of your bolts on a different

16
00:00:58,811 --> 00:01:01,300
ocean and he understood that if you want,

17
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,470
if you're going to take a a high risk,
you'd better get a high return.

18
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:09,580
Otherwise no one was willing to take it.
And so he made that very clear. In fact,

19
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:12,520
I think the whole point of
the play is about economics.

20
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,940
The merchant of Venice and he made
both of these principles very clear,

21
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,910
but he couldn't quantify them
and he couldn't mathematize them.

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,000
And the capital asset pricing
model gives a mathematical,

23
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:27,001
quantifiable form to both and up quite
shocking recommendation in both cases.

24
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,410
So just to draw those two pictures,

25
00:01:29,411 --> 00:01:34,240
for those of you who didn't hear it last
night, if you do Tobin's famous picture,

26
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:39,241
this is the Markowitz Tobin
Markowitz Tobin capitol market line,

27
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:42,910
they called it,

28
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,910
you pour it and it's very important to
keep straight what's on the diagram.

29
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,350
There's the standard deviation
of any acid per dollar.

30
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,700
So here I'm writing the price,
so it's per dollar.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,200
And here is the expectation
of the acid per dollar.

32
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:06,700
So Pi of why I'm calling that the
price. Okay, let's just per dollar,

33
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,890
and I'm not going to go
over what we derived before,

34
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:16,640
but we noticed that if you take in you,
if you took all the risky assets,

35
00:02:16,641 --> 00:02:19,490
you know,
any risky assets going to have per dollar,

36
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,180
if it's priced some standard
deviation and some expectation,

37
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,200
you can write down all the risky assets
and you can combine them and you'll get

38
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,190
a possibility set that looks like this.
Okay?

39
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:36,191
So the diversification already shows up
in this picture because you don't have,

40
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:40,040
you combine this asset and this asset,

41
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,310
you're going to get possibilities
by putting half your money in each,

42
00:02:43,311 --> 00:02:44,900
not on a straight line between them,

43
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:48,950
but on some curved line that's much
better because you're reducing your risk.

44
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,980
Okay? And so, uh, Tobin,

45
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:55,520
so mark what's already had that
curve and this picture in mind,

46
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,700
Tobin added the risk was acid,
which she put. And then he said,

47
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:02,110
well,
if there's a risk plus acid,

48
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,960
everybody's going to do the
same thing and they're going to,

49
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,710
everyone's going to choose the same point.
It's better for everybody.

50
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,480
So this is the optimal risky portfolio

51
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,400
and it has to be equal to the market.

52
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,670
Because if everybody's smart
enough to figure out what to do,

53
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:24,490
they're all going to do the same
thing and everyone's going to whatever

54
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,610
everybody holds. That's by
definition in the market. Okay?

55
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:32,611
So Toban show that everybody should
choose something on this capital market

56
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:35,440
line.
And so everybody should,

57
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,440
everybody should split as money
between the market and a risk.

58
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:48,030
We'll Sasson put your money in the bank.
We're only entire market.

59
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,800
That was his recommendation.

60
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:54,600
And that was the beginning of the
whole idea of index investing. Okay,

61
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,570
so that was the first idea.
First most important idea.

62
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,700
Now how could you investing,
how could you test this?

63
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,653
Well,

64
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,700
you could simply test every
fun in history and compare,

65
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,680
you know,
of x,

66
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:13,980
so called experts and see if those
guys could get you above this line.

67
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,540
So by the way,
the slope of the line,

68
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:20,010
one more thing is the
slope equal Sharpe ratio.

69
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,060
Okay? So everybody's trying to get
the highest sharp ratio they can.

70
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,600
And if you end up, you know, if you have
this portfolio, you've made a mistake,

71
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:31,070
you haven't held the optimal one,

72
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,180
then the slope of your performance
will be a lower Sharpe ratio than that.

73
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:36,590
You're the slope of this,

74
00:04:36,591 --> 00:04:40,550
which is the sharp ratio of that point
is worse than the slope of that which is

75
00:04:40,551 --> 00:04:41,810
the sharp ratio.
This point,

76
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,800
the Sharpe ratio will remember
is the expectation per dollar

77
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,300
minus what you can get in the riskless
asset per dollar divided by the standard

78
00:04:53,061 --> 00:04:57,440
deviation of y per
dollar, let's say. Okay,

79
00:04:57,441 --> 00:04:59,720
so that's the,
that's just the slope of this line.

80
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,160
So we can measure performance of a
portfolio manager by the sharp ratio.

81
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,590
Everyone should try and get
the highest sharp ratio.

82
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,570
The upshot of diversification is you
should buy a little bit of every stock in

83
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:14,960
the economy, no matter how small, no
matter how big, no matter how safe,

84
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:18,500
no matter how risky you should
spread your money across everything.

85
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,790
That's the recommendation of Tobin and
it relies of course on everybody else

86
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,700
being rational. So everybody
else is choosing the right thing.

87
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:31,130
Then you can just piggy back and do
what everybody else is doing. Okay.

88
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:35,150
So that's the first thing. Very
shocking. As I said, at first glance,

89
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:39,830
you'd think someone who is loves risk
would just invest in risky stocks and

90
00:05:39,831 --> 00:05:43,910
people who's very people very risk averse.
When just invest in safe stocks,

91
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,410
Tobin says, no, no, no, no. If you're
very risk tolerant or risk averse,

92
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,710
you should just put most of your money
in the bank and hold a little bit of

93
00:05:51,711 --> 00:05:55,250
every stock. So you're here somewhere.
If you're very risk tolerant,

94
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,140
you shouldn't just
concentrate on the risky,

95
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,710
you should buy the same proportion
of also stocks as everyone else.

96
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,450
But you should borrow the money to do it.

97
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,840
And maybe way up here and people
who borrow money to invest.

98
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,360
That's called leveraging.

99
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,020
Okay.

100
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,450
Okay.
So that's idea number one,

101
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,500
the crucial idea and a lot of
ideas mixed in that. And as I said,

102
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:20,160
you can test it by seeing if everyone
could be, anyone can beat the market.

103
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,540
Is there anyone who historically has hired
a higher sharp ratio than the market?

104
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,170
And,
and in 1967,

105
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,160
when all this was being tested, you
know, there was a famous book called, um,

106
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,870
a random walk down Wall
Street written by Matthew,

107
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,560
Walk Down Wall Street,

108
00:06:40,561 --> 00:06:45,090
which I recommend you read a random
walk down Wall Street in which people,

109
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,870
he gives the history of tests of whether
people could beat the market. Of course,

110
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:51,270
many people beat the market
for short periods of time,

111
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:53,730
then they totally collapsed.
And uh,

112
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,480
and then some people beat the market
for 20 years in a row and then retire.

113
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,330
But there are so few of those
people that it looks like, you know,

114
00:07:00,331 --> 00:07:03,000
but just by random dumb luck,
you could get almost those people.

115
00:07:03,001 --> 00:07:03,750
On the other hand,

116
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,020
there's some people like Warren Buffett
who seem to beat the market for 40 or 50

117
00:07:07,021 --> 00:07:11,520
years. It's really hard to believe
that that's all just luck. And uh,

118
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,880
so that's one test of the thing.

119
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:19,680
Then the second idea of the capital
asset pricing model is risk and return.

120
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,110
And so now if we assume,

121
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,930
so all this graph by the way
assumed quadratic utilities,

122
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,570
quadratic where mean variants,
utilities, quadratic utility.

123
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,750
And a common probabilities.

124
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,970
So everybody knew what the probabilities
were, the different states.

125
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:45,120
So you know how to measure the covariance
and the variants and all that cause

126
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:49,620
you know what the probabilities
are to measure over. So here, uh,

127
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:54,890
having assume that it turns out that
you just apply the principle that we saw

128
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,360
the first few days of class,

129
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,800
that the price is going to
equal the marginal utility.

130
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:09,480
Hey, not the total utility price
is going to equal margin utility.

131
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,910
And if the price equals
the marginal utility,

132
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:17,060
the Margie utility is
going to be, uh, depends.

133
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,640
According to this assumption of quadratic
utilities as we showed depends on

134
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,960
expectation.

135
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:30,610
So this is the price of y.
Let's just call it pie of why.

136
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:34,660
Like I did before. Okay. It
depends on the expectation of why,

137
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,830
and it depends on the covariance.
Oh,

138
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,110
why with the market.
Okay.

139
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:47,580
So it doesn't depend on
the W we've assumed with
quadratic utilities that people

140
00:08:47,581 --> 00:08:49,410
only care about the mean and the variance.

141
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,460
So you would have expected don't the
margin utility of any single asset to

142
00:08:53,461 --> 00:08:56,910
depend on its mean and its variance.
But it's the marginal utility.

143
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,190
It's what it adds to
what you've already got.

144
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,280
So it adds expectation
because expectations additive.

145
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:05,100
But when you add another stock
to what you already have,

146
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,200
the variants of the whole portfolio
changes according to the covariants of the

147
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:14,280
new thing with what you already had and
everybody already had the market. Okay.

148
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:18,600
So given that you know that
the price mathematically,

149
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:23,601
therefore the price has to equal
something times the expectation of y plus

150
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:28,980
something times the covariance
of why with the market.

151
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,020
Okay.
But that's true for all why in particular?

152
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:38,460
It's true for the riskless acids.
So the riskless asset pays one for sure,

153
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,730
has no covariance with anything like
the market and its price is one over one

154
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:48,000
plus r. So therefore a has
to be one over one plus r.

155
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,120
So we know that this has to be one plus
r and then okay be could be whatever it

156
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:59,130
is, the covariance, by the way, it's going
to be bad. So this is minus and then B,

157
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:03,660
you have to figure be out those loans.
So you don't know what B is. A Priori,

158
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,350
even though at the interest rate is
either, you had to see that in the market.

159
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,850
Once you know the price of one asset
and you know it's correlation with the

160
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:12,684
market.

161
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,530
If you knew this price and you know
the expectation of why and you know the

162
00:10:16,531 --> 00:10:21,210
Coburn's with the market that will tell
you being so once you've given one price

163
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,030
of a risky asset,
like of the market as a whole,

164
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,520
you're going to be able to figure
out the price of every other asset.

165
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,530
Cause from that one price you can
deduce B. And once you have be,

166
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:34,020
you can price everything. So that's
the second idea of risk and return.

167
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,960
And you can see it graphically
and more dramatically.

168
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,660
Because if I take that same equation,

169
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:42,540
this is called the
covariance pricing formula.

170
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:47,541
You take that and divide by Pi of why
you get one equals expectation of y

171
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:54,171
divided by the price of y dividing
both sides by Pi of y minus B times the

172
00:10:56,881 --> 00:11:01,881
covariance of y over the
price of y with them.

173
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,110
Okay?
And that.

174
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,930
So that just tells me the expectation
and the covariance of a dollar's worth,

175
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:14,730
just like this was a dollar's worth. This
was per dollar and this is per dollar.

176
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,820
So if you put the covariance of why and
the Pi of lie down here and Ammo for

177
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:22,410
here and here,

178
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:27,411
you put expectation why over pie of why
this just says this is just a constant,

179
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:33,150
and this is a constant. So it says
this and this are linearly related.

180
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,520
These are all securities
would have priced one.

181
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,110
There has to be a linear relationship
between their expectation for dollar in

182
00:11:40,111 --> 00:11:43,470
their covariance per dollar with the
market. And as the covariance gets higher,

183
00:11:43,471 --> 00:11:46,110
the return gets higher.
So only people,

184
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:49,620
so if you take a stock
with a high covariance,

185
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,170
it's going to have to have
a high expected return.

186
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,270
That's exactly what Shakespeare said.
If it's more risky,

187
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,480
people won't hold it unless
it's got a higher return,

188
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,670
which means you can buy
it for a cheap price.

189
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:04,240
So it's price is less than
it's expectation. But the,

190
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,270
the difference with Shakespeare
is we've quantified risk.

191
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,350
It's not what you would've thought.
Variance. It's covariance and that's it.

192
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:14,800
Those are the two big ideas.
And you could test,

193
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,710
so this is called the
security market line.

194
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,373
Okay.

195
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,500
And you could test this
by asking is every stock.

196
00:12:25,501 --> 00:12:28,840
So if you look at every stock last year,
you look at it's covariance,

197
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,790
you put a point here, then you look
this year at its expected return,

198
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,500
of course some stocks
are going to be wild,

199
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:37,740
but you average over a bunch of
stocks and a bunch of years, you know,

200
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:42,210
do you get things that why in a straight
line or close to a straight line and

201
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:47,211
sharp in 1967 found that amazingly
when you did that you got,

202
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,350
so I described last night
exactly what his task was.

203
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,130
You got something that looked incredibly
close to a straight line like that.

204
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,180
So this was the greatest triumph in
the history of the social sciences.

205
00:13:00,181 --> 00:13:04,200
It was called because you had huge
amounts of data, huge, you know,

206
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:09,000
capacity to test things. A shocking
conclusion, a shockingly precise,

207
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:13,440
you know, theory, the test and it
fit the line so incredibly closely.

208
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,860
And it, it just swept. Uh,

209
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,030
it made a huge impression and financing
and Economics and lots of Nobel prizes

210
00:13:21,031 --> 00:13:24,420
were given for the sharp won a Nobel
prize mark, which won a Nobel prize.

211
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,380
Tobin won a Nobel Prize winner died.

212
00:13:28,381 --> 00:13:32,910
He would have won a Nobel
prize too. Um, okay,

213
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,270
so this was the first
major triumph of fine,

214
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,140
the most important trying to find for
the capital asset pricing model. Now,

215
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:44,460
as it happens, as the theory has
been tested over and over again,

216
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:49,290
every year since 1967,
it's performed more and more poorly.

217
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,090
And so now when you do this,

218
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,740
you get points that looked like this
and like that and like this, and they,

219
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:59,160
they don't seem to lie on a,
on a straight line at all.

220
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:04,350
And it's pretty shocking how up until 67
or the early seventies and seem to work

221
00:14:04,351 --> 00:14:07,620
out perfectly and now it
doesn't work very well. Okay.

222
00:14:07,621 --> 00:14:11,580
And the Markowitz and this business,
they've also discovered according to this,

223
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:13,680
you know, you couldn't
beat the market. Okay.

224
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:15,600
So how do you test whether
something beats the market?

225
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:18,180
You can pick a bunch of people and say,
could they beat the market?

226
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,360
Or you can actually just make up a
strategy yourself like by only new stocks

227
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,690
just every year by the stocks that are
come on to the s and p 500 for the first

228
00:14:27,691 --> 00:14:28,320
time.

229
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,640
Or just buy the stocks that are the
biggest 10% and it turns out some of those

230
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:34,500
strategies actually do beat the market.

231
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:39,000
So I don't have time to go into the
details, you know, that is, they lie, uh,

232
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:43,080
above or below here. So the theories
coming too. So theory and doubt.

233
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,320
And so what I'm going to
talk about next week is,

234
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,850
and it certainly doesn't explain
the current crisis. Okay.

235
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:54,440
So want next week to explain crisis.

236
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,730
So next week I'm going to end
by giving a counter theory,

237
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,790
another theory, which is, you know,

238
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,180
going to explain the crisis
and be different from this one.

239
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,270
But of course it hasn't been
tested over 30 years or 50 years.

240
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:11,150
Like KPM KPM look great
for the first 20 years.

241
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,590
So whatever I say next week we'll
probably turn out to be 90% wrong.

242
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,770
But at the moment it looks pretty good
and I didn't want to spend half the

243
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:22,160
course on it in case in 20 years and
seem to be ridiculous. But anyway,

244
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:26,600
I'm going to present it anyway to those
of you who want to hear it, um, next week.

245
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:27,860
And there'll be,
I think,

246
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,480
understandable and down to earth and
it will invoke a very basic thing.

247
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,600
Nowhere in this model that we
take into account, you know,

248
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,980
when we say people leverage,

249
00:15:36,981 --> 00:15:39,620
that means they're borrowing
money and choosing to go up here.

250
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,440
We haven't taken into account,
um,

251
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,860
that they're gonna have to pay the money
back and who's going to trust them to

252
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:49,080
pay the money back and forcing them to
do something to guarantee they're going

253
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:52,700
to take pay the money back is going to
change the theory in a critical way,

254
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,640
which I'll get to next week. Okay. Now,
one last thing about the theory. Um,

255
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,191
as I say,

256
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:03,110
you test it by seeing nobody should be
above this line and nobody should be

257
00:16:03,111 --> 00:16:06,650
above this line. But of course you
can find people above this line.

258
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,460
Swenson to take a famous yell
examples above this line.

259
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,320
And you can find people above this line.
Ellington.

260
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,060
So Ellington, let's say above this
line. All right, so what a hedge funds,

261
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:23,210
let's just call it an anonymous hedge
funds since we're on camera now.

262
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,680
Hedge Fund Hedge Fund II. Okay. Above.

263
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,430
So the question is, is
that luck, you know,

264
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,540
they just did it a few
years in both cases,

265
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:39,830
like 15 years a piece or is it just or
is it, does it mean something? All right,

266
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:42,260
well, so you can measure the Co, you know,

267
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:44,960
if you believe this theory
and you just say, okay,

268
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:47,270
let's say the theory is 99% true,

269
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,000
it's just that there are a few
people who really do beat the market,

270
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,270
then you can decide by looking
at these graphs, you know,

271
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,820
just how good is Swenson
relative to the market.

272
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:59,870
How good is this hedge fund
relative to the market and a,

273
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,050
so you have a way of calibrating
and measuring how well people do.

274
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,880
So I don't have time to get into that.

275
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:09,230
But I would measure the quality of a
hedge fund by its marginal Sharpe ratio.

276
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,410
How much does having
access to this hedge fund,

277
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:16,820
if you added it to your portfolio,
increase your portfolio hedge ratio.

278
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,880
That's I think the right measure
of how good a hedge fund is.

279
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:25,090
And the right measure of how good
Swinson is is what's the sharp ratio.

280
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,200
And so there's a different criteria,

281
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:31,130
and I keep emphasizing this Swenson
is managing an entire portfolio.

282
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:35,120
So you have to measure him on
housing done free, Gail, you don't,

283
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,550
not because yells not going to
combine him with something else.

284
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:42,050
It's just holding what he holds. So
it's his sharp ratio. But Ellington,

285
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:44,180
you're going to combine,
Ellington was some other stuff.

286
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:47,090
So Swenson might invest in Ellington,
but 10 million other things.

287
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:52,200
And so you have to say, how is Ellington
gonna help Swenson's Sharpe ratio?

288
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,120
So instead of Swinson Sharpe ratio,

289
00:17:54,121 --> 00:17:57,090
how much is Ellington going to
help the market Sharpe ratio?

290
00:17:57,091 --> 00:17:59,130
So that's how you should
measure a hedge fund.

291
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:03,510
It's marginal Sharpe ratio and,
and uh,

292
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:08,970
Swenson by these, his sharp
ratio. Okay. So I'd say, you know,

293
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,000
um, measure Swenson, performance

294
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,550
Swenson performance,
my Sharpe ratio

295
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:23,280
ain't measure hedge fund

296
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:29,780
performance by marginal Sharpe ratio
because you'd be crazy to put all your

297
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:33,834
money in a

298
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,850
hedge fund.

299
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,490
The only people who do it are the
partners of the hedge fund who are sort of

300
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:41,870
forced to do it because that's all they
can persuade investors that they're

301
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:46,130
really paying attention to their fund
because all their money's at risk. But um,

302
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,070
okay, so that's it. That's
the basic bottom line.

303
00:18:49,071 --> 00:18:52,640
So there any questions before
I now move on from this?

304
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,380
Okay.

305
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,970
Okay.
We talked about this last night,

306
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:58,760
we've talked about it for the
last two lectures. All right.

307
00:18:58,761 --> 00:19:00,710
So it's a high watermark,
as I say,

308
00:19:00,711 --> 00:19:05,711
incredibly precise prediction
and incredibly close to
the facts at least in 1967

309
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,990
but on that, not after
that. Now I want them,

310
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,760
I moved to an aside of social security
before I come back to black shoals,

311
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:18,170
which is the next high water, the last
high watermark of the standard theory.

312
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:22,730
So [inaudible] remember the upshot
of what we've talked about so far,

313
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,750
the upshot of this is that,
um,

314
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,143
the market,

315
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,850
we'll get a higher return.

316
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,280
Oh, by the way, I just
say one other thing.

317
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:44,800
What is the standard
critique of this theory?

318
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,370
So of course everybody else is seeing
that the theory doesn't work. So what is,

319
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,080
what is their explanation for why,

320
00:19:50,081 --> 00:19:52,840
what's the old explanation for why
the theory isn't working so well?

321
00:19:52,841 --> 00:19:55,570
Now the explanation is
that in the old days,

322
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,230
what was thought of as the market
was just all American stocks.

323
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,690
But now it's pretty obvious.
In fact,

324
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:03,160
it should have been
obvious from the beginning.

325
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:06,790
And so Swenson realized
that early on that mark,

326
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,730
what's his advice is to
diversify, diversify, diversify,

327
00:20:09,731 --> 00:20:11,410
not just into all American stocks,

328
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:14,860
into everything all over the world and
all kinds of assets that are in stocks at

329
00:20:14,861 --> 00:20:19,510
all. So what you measure as the market
shouldn't just be American stocks.

330
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:24,310
It should be the world portfolio. But
how do you measure the world portfolio?

331
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,430
That's hard to do.
And so people have tried to maintain that.

332
00:20:27,431 --> 00:20:31,540
The reason the theory doesn't work is
because we've got the wrong m in all these

333
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,180
equations.
Okay?

334
00:20:34,181 --> 00:20:36,820
So that would be a nice
way of fixing the theory.

335
00:20:36,821 --> 00:20:41,710
I doubt if that's going to help in the
end. So my problem about collaterals,

336
00:20:41,711 --> 00:20:43,690
a different look at it,
but anyhow,

337
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:48,130
so the market according to the theory
will get a higher return. Okay.

338
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:51,730
Then bonds and of course that's true.

339
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:56,170
And the market has a very high
positive covariance with itself.

340
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,850
So very low price up here,
it's high covariance with itself.

341
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:04,180
So a low price compared to its
expectation, the prices low.

342
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,720
So you're paying much less
than the expectations.

343
00:21:06,721 --> 00:21:08,530
So then when you see
what actually happens,

344
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,710
it's going to look much higher than that.
It's going to be the racial, you know,

345
00:21:11,711 --> 00:21:14,680
it's not just this, the price
is lower, therefore the, the,

346
00:21:14,681 --> 00:21:17,920
the final outcome's going to be
much bigger on average. Okay.

347
00:21:17,921 --> 00:21:22,510
So to put it another way,
if you had two possibilities,

348
00:21:22,511 --> 00:21:26,890
which you knew were equally likely a half
and a half, and the market, you know,

349
00:21:26,891 --> 00:21:31,120
paid off good, something good
here and something bad here.

350
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,920
Okay. So everybody's rich here
and everybody's poor here.

351
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:40,150
The price of the Arrow security of this
state is going to be much lower than the

352
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:44,530
price of the Earl security of this state.
This state is going to have a price,

353
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:49,210
you know, uh, let's say 0.8, and this
one might have a price point too,

354
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:53,380
because here the bad state,
that's when everybody's poor.

355
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,120
So you're going to,
you know,

356
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,360
this formula basically tells you
that if you're paying off here,

357
00:21:58,361 --> 00:22:00,940
you're negatively
correlated with the market.

358
00:22:00,941 --> 00:22:04,150
You're going to have to pay a very high
price for it because you're hedging,

359
00:22:04,151 --> 00:22:07,330
you know, by buying this
security or balancing off, uh,

360
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:12,190
what you have with the market by
buying the market, your, you know,

361
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:13,060
your,
um,

362
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,960
people don't like that because it adds
more risk to what you already have.

363
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,210
And so the price of this is going,
people don't like,

364
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:22,210
it's not going to pay very much of the
price will be much less than the actual

365
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:26,050
probability of a half. Okay.
So I want to now, all right,

366
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:27,790
so that's the conclusion
of what we've done.

367
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,190
I want to now connect
this to social security.

368
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,250
So you remember in our
social security model,

369
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:38,620
we had land that went here, here, here,

370
00:22:38,621 --> 00:22:41,620
you know, paid one, one, one, one, one.

371
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,790
And we had these people overlap
in generations. People like that.

372
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,650
Okay?
And we discovered a very important thing.

373
00:22:50,651 --> 00:22:55,651
The reason why social security seems to
be broke is because we gave away so much

374
00:22:55,961 --> 00:22:58,150
money to the people in
the first generation.

375
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:02,620
It's not that social security wastes
money like George Bush seems to imply

376
00:23:02,621 --> 00:23:05,170
whenever he talks about it,
it's not like they just throw it away.

377
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:09,220
It's that we gave a huge
gift to the people in the
forties, the 50s and the 60s.

378
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,570
And so everyone after that has to
pay for that, uh, pay for that gift.

379
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:19,170
But there's a little bit more to George
Bush a story then I'm allowed so far,

380
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,190
which is that he doesn't,

381
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,940
he wants to put the money into stocks and
we know that stocks are going to get a

382
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:32,080
higher return than bonds. Okay?
That's the whole point of this theory.

383
00:23:32,081 --> 00:23:33,160
He put money in stocks.

384
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:36,640
The expected return on stocks is higher
than the expected return on bonds.

385
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,270
So if you want to make this mathematical,

386
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:44,800
we have to add the possibility of risk
and stocks and it looks like it's going

387
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:49,370
to be complicated, but we can do it
very easily. So I'm going to just put,

388
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:54,490
I'm going to reproduce the same picture
with uncertainty and stocks in it.

389
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,090
And then we're going to come back to
social security and spend 15 minutes

390
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:03,440
talking about, uh, what, what's
the right plan for social security?

391
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:07,790
So how could I make this,
how could I take the simple model,

392
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:11,420
which already seemed complicated,
it's already pretty complicated model,

393
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:16,040
had no uncertainty and I'll
put uncertainty in it. Okay,

394
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:19,850
well I'm going to suppose that land,
okay,

395
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:23,410
so this is the land dividends
I'm now going to describe.

396
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,140
And by the way, I had people
with endowments here, they
were three one and three.

397
00:24:31,141 --> 00:24:32,880
One,
remember this is their endowments,

398
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,550
but we didn't say where
those endowments came from.

399
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,850
So I'm going to take the land dividends.
I'm going to suppose the dividend,

400
00:24:38,851 --> 00:24:41,370
the land today is one.
But you know,

401
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,680
things might get better
or worse in the future.

402
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:48,300
Maybe the dividend goes to
two or down to a half. Say,

403
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,710
you know, I'm taking some extreme
case where it doubles are halves.

404
00:24:52,711 --> 00:24:57,220
And maybe after that it could double again
or it could go back to one and here I

405
00:24:57,221 --> 00:25:00,840
could go to one or could go to a corner.
So you know,

406
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,840
what dividends are doing is a,
is a random walk.

407
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:08,820
If the economy starts getting more
productive, um, you know, then,

408
00:25:08,821 --> 00:25:09,960
then it's in a better position.

409
00:25:09,961 --> 00:25:12,270
And from that point things
get even more productive.

410
00:25:12,271 --> 00:25:15,930
Or maybe go back to where they were. If
things get worse, you know, they're worse,

411
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,930
but maybe things will start to get
better again or continue to get worse.

412
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:22,890
So this is what I imagine
as my process of dividends.

413
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,860
Okay?
So if you own the land,

414
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:29,490
you get all these dividends
in the whole infinite future.

415
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,230
All right? And now let's say
that there's labor as well.

416
00:25:36,231 --> 00:25:39,470
So labor incomes, I have to make
an assumption about labor income.

417
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,040
Okay?
So I'm going to assume only young word.

418
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,630
So here are, we kind of made
the same assumption. You know,

419
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,420
you get a lot when you're young
and not much when you're old.

420
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,400
I'm gonna assume only the young work
and I'm going to assume that this

421
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,390
productivity gains or losses you don't,
by the way,

422
00:26:02,391 --> 00:26:03,980
you might think you never go backwards.

423
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:07,100
Maybe it goes from one
to two or one to 1.1.

424
00:26:07,101 --> 00:26:11,420
So it's always growing but never,
but you know, but but random.

425
00:26:11,421 --> 00:26:14,720
But I'm just going to keep it here
since I solve this example. Yeah,

426
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,770
last night I might as well stick to that
one, but there's no reason why I quit.

427
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,820
I could have made the thing
always no matter what,

428
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:23,570
get either stay the same or get better.

429
00:26:23,571 --> 00:26:27,560
That might've been a better example to
do a more realistic because we don't

430
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:31,580
really have tremendous productivity
declines. Um, but anyway,

431
00:26:31,581 --> 00:26:33,860
all by mean to do is to
put some randomness here.

432
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:39,100
So only young work and wages
a proportional to dividends.

433
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,680
So let's just assume this,

434
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,970
so I'm assuming this is,

435
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,380
this is what's called a
neutral technical change.

436
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,430
So presumably the reason why productivity
is going up the dividends or getting

437
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:03,150
high or is there more discoveries
improving the product of the land,

438
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,730
but they're probably also
improving the product of labor.

439
00:27:05,731 --> 00:27:07,950
And so let's say they have
the same effect on both.

440
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:13,080
So I'm going to assume that Labor is
actually what the one above, let's uh,

441
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,770
okay.

442
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:19,910
Let's, uh, say Labor always gets
three times with dividends are,

443
00:27:19,911 --> 00:27:21,500
so this is a six.

444
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,920
This will be three halves and this
will be 12 and three again and three

445
00:27:27,711 --> 00:27:30,170
quarters.
That's what Labor is getting.

446
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:33,830
So labor income shouldn't
know switch colors, labor

447
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,443
income.

448
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,000
Okay.
So that's my complicated world.

449
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,130
Way more complicated than it was before.
So if you own the land,

450
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:48,490
you get all the dividends in the future.
People live two periods.

451
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:51,850
So I'm going to assume that utility.
So you're going to be,

452
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,360
you're going to live when you're young
and then when you're old and up and we

453
00:27:57,641 --> 00:28:02,230
are old in down. Okay. So you
know you're going to live,

454
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,430
let's say a guy born here, he's
young here, she's young here,

455
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:10,780
she can work here or she can. Um, and
then she's going to be old here in here.

456
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:15,640
But when she's old, it's not clear how
good her investment is going to turn out.

457
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:19,330
So this is going to
just be our simple log.

458
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,700
I'll call this a half log.

459
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,390
Y lost a quarter log,

460
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:30,190
Z up plus of quarter,
log z down.

461
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,880
Okay,
so you don't discount the future.

462
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:38,140
Let's say you just take log of
consumption today plus a half, you know,

463
00:28:38,141 --> 00:28:40,540
probability,
a half of log consumption,

464
00:28:40,541 --> 00:28:42,820
the upstate half log and
consumption of the downstate.

465
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,490
So the probabilities here are a half.

466
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,540
These are the objective probabilities.
Okay?

467
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:53,600
So maybe I should have written
that utility. Maybe better.

468
00:28:53,601 --> 00:28:56,630
It would have been to write
the utility like that. Hey,

469
00:28:56,631 --> 00:29:01,340
that's what people know what the
probabilities are. Okay, so that's it.

470
00:29:01,341 --> 00:29:02,330
That's my setup.

471
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:09,440
So what should the economy do? What
should people do? You see, if you buy,

472
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:12,830
you know, if you're a,
some person like this lady,

473
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,720
when here she could,
um,

474
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,730
she could decide to hold bonds and she
could get whatever the interest rate

475
00:29:19,731 --> 00:29:21,770
turns out to be,
which we're going to compute in a minute.

476
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,800
Or she could hold stock,
in which case she's going to get,

477
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:27,410
let's start her off here.

478
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:31,850
Maybe she could buy land.
Okay, buy stock now.

479
00:29:31,851 --> 00:29:35,150
We don't want the prices yet. We have to
compute that. But if she buys the stock,

480
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,140
she'll get a dividend of two here and be
able to sell the land for a high price

481
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:42,730
because from here on, it's obviously
pretty better than it was back here.

482
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,360
Or she might get unlucky and
the price might, you know,

483
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:49,690
the dividend might be really terrible,
just a half. And not only that,

484
00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:53,320
but the land she sells when she's old is
also going to have a really lousy price.

485
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,760
So she holds land,

486
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,080
she's going to get a high dividend or
a high capital return or else a low

487
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:02,230
dividend, a low capital return.
It's really risky for her.

488
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:06,100
Or she could just buy a bond at whatever
interest rate it turns out to be and

489
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:10,270
get some things safe. So what
should she do? And, and uh,

490
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,351
you know,

491
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:16,351
will that be a good thing for the economy
or can we make everybody better off by

492
00:30:16,411 --> 00:30:18,670
him by using social security?

493
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,940
So how can we solve this?

494
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,460
Okay, so it looks like a
really complicated model
to Saul because we've got a

495
00:30:32,461 --> 00:30:34,980
generation born here,
another one born here,

496
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,640
the same generation might be born up
here under different circumstances.

497
00:30:38,641 --> 00:30:40,450
And then this generation here,

498
00:30:40,451 --> 00:30:44,160
it could be born under any three different
circumstances the way they do the lot

499
00:30:44,161 --> 00:30:44,994
to solve for.

500
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:51,860
But what we know is that when we compute
the Arrow price starting from any

501
00:30:51,961 --> 00:30:56,640
point, this arrow price is
going to be bigger than I have.

502
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,300
And this one's going to be less than a
half because the economy is, you know,

503
00:31:00,301 --> 00:31:02,040
doing much worse down here.

504
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,640
And so people know they're all going to
get screwed down here and consume a lot

505
00:31:05,641 --> 00:31:08,610
less. So to hedge that,
they're all gonna want to buy,

506
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,970
they're going to be desperate
to buy consumption down here.

507
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,770
Of course they can't all do that.

508
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,250
So it's gotta be the price that's more
than a half that discourages them from

509
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:18,084
doing that.

510
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:21,150
And they don't really need that much
to buy up here because you know their

511
00:31:21,151 --> 00:31:23,310
dividends, you know they're
going to be so rich anyway.

512
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:27,660
So the price there are security is
going to be less, uh, it, you know,

513
00:31:27,661 --> 00:31:30,930
is going to be a less than a half because
there's so much that they have to end

514
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:34,980
up holding and that'll encourage
them to Dubai. I mean, sorry,

515
00:31:34,981 --> 00:31:36,090
I said the logic backwards.

516
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,970
There's so much that they're going to
hand off to end up consuming because the

517
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:40,320
economy is so productive.

518
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,350
How can you get them to plan
to consume that much up there?

519
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:46,720
It's by having a low Errol security price.
So in even an advance,

520
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:49,890
they know that they're going to end up
consuming a lot and they're happy to do

521
00:31:49,891 --> 00:31:53,520
that because they're willing to buy or
sell securities because they're so cheap.

522
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,900
Okay, so how, how do we solve all this?

523
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,320
So everybody following the problem,
it's quite a complicated problem,

524
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,200
but it's turns out to have
a very simple answer. Yep.

525
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:09,470
Price of consumption is
high,

526
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:11,210
but the price of land is low.
Yes.

527
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:14,610
Right. So well. So if you start

528
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,630
starting from here,
the price of consult,

529
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,620
if you want to buy at this point,
consumption at this point,

530
00:32:22,621 --> 00:32:24,630
you're going to have to pay
more than a half to get it.

531
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,920
But you know that once you get here, the
price of land is going to have dropped.

532
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,020
So yes,
I'm agreeing with you

533
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,293
Kevin,

534
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:38,860
right now, why should the price of
land be lower here? Because here,

535
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,840
so remember the price of land is
always in terms of the new Martin,

536
00:32:42,841 --> 00:32:44,810
the consumption. Good. That period,

537
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,350
every period I might as well take
an apple to be have a price of one.

538
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,483
So you'll see APP,

539
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:54,380
the land here is producing an entire
apple and on average going forward,

540
00:32:54,381 --> 00:32:56,270
you know it's going to
be producing one apple.

541
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,720
The geometric average of all these
numbers is one starting at this point.

542
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:03,350
Once you've gone down to here,
production has deteriorated.

543
00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:06,680
The land is only producing half
an apple here. And in the future,

544
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:09,800
instead of reducing 12 it's going to
produce three apples here and only three

545
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:12,080
quarters on happening.
So it's crummy or land down here.

546
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:16,400
So you're going to pay less for the
land. Okay? Any other questions?

547
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,910
But I'm going to tell you exactly
what you'll pay for the land.

548
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,410
So we're going to solve this.
So need to solve

549
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,390
for land price

550
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,160
in each state

551
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,473
and

552
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,760
um,
interest rate.

553
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:41,963
Okay.

554
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:51,200
At each state
and

555
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:57,730
price of up Arielle security

556
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,300
and price

557
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,920
down Arielle security

558
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,463
at each state.

559
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,010
So how can we do all
that? Well, first of all,

560
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,890
you notice that the Arrow
securities are always the key.

561
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:21,010
Once you solve for those,
you can figure out everything else.

562
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,850
So we just have to solve for these,
the price of the up and down arrows,

563
00:34:24,851 --> 00:34:26,130
securities in every state.

564
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:36,020
Oh,
this was me in a previous class today.

565
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:46,260
I didn't erase it. I figured the next
guy wouldn't do it. Serves me. Right.

566
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:51,563
Okay.

567
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,890
Okay. So how can we solve this? Well,

568
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,330
we can guess.
Yes,

569
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:15,320
let's do appear. Yes. That,

570
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,780
um,
these prices,

571
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,630
Arielle prices

572
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:29,110
the same
at every state.

573
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:38,160
Okay. So what do you, what I mean by that?

574
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:42,360
I mean here, how many apples would
you pay to get an apple here?

575
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:47,220
I'm guessing that that's the same amount
you would pay here to get an apple here.

576
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:48,991
Okay.

577
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:53,460
And then what you would pay an apple at
this point to get an apple down here is

578
00:35:53,461 --> 00:35:57,210
going to be the same as this generation
would pay to get an apple down here.

579
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,510
There's a lot that's a guest. We have
to verify that that's going to work.

580
00:36:00,511 --> 00:36:01,980
It seems like everything's sort of home

581
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,490
genius.
And so guess

582
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,480
that price of land

583
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:14,180
lamb is proportional to dividends.

584
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,160
The dividends
in that state.

585
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,000
Okay, well the whole thing is sort
of homogeneous and everything.

586
00:36:28,001 --> 00:36:32,500
So you know the land here is four
times as good as the land here.

587
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:36,970
The land here is four times as good as
the land here because the dividends are

588
00:36:36,971 --> 00:36:41,140
always four times higher if you go up
one thing. So this is four times that,

589
00:36:41,141 --> 00:36:42,010
that's four times that.

590
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:46,750
So why not guessed that the price of
land is four times here than it is here

591
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,580
four times higher here than it
is here. Sounds possible. Anyway.

592
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,630
And of course these are going to
turn out to be correct guesses.

593
00:36:52,631 --> 00:36:54,340
So once you make these guesses,

594
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,140
it's going to be very simple to find the
equilibrium and then we can verify that

595
00:36:59,141 --> 00:37:03,400
the guest is are correct.
Okay.

596
00:37:03,401 --> 00:37:07,060
So what does this guy want to do here?

597
00:37:07,061 --> 00:37:10,270
So assume you only work when you're young.
So what's your income?

598
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:12,700
What's anybody's income
like this young guy here?

599
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,590
Young at time.

600
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:20,380
At time one.
So this is time one here.

601
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:26,530
It's time to time. Three time
four. So yeah, Taiwan, their income

602
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,640
income is three

603
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:33,950
because that's what their wage was.

604
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,700
They work when they're young and
they've got three. That's it.

605
00:37:37,701 --> 00:37:40,130
They don't own the land. When they're
born, they're going to buy the land,

606
00:37:40,131 --> 00:37:42,230
but they don't own it now.
Okay.

607
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,740
What do they want to do?

608
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,760
They want to consume when they're
young or utility where member.

609
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,130
So what's their budget set?

610
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,930
Your budget said is they
can consume why that's

611
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:59,160
consuming here, where they
can consume here. Here. Okay.

612
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:00,540
But so they can consume,

613
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,860
uh, p, uh,

614
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:07,920
up times Z up plus p down Timesi down.

615
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:13,470
That's what they can do with
Oh zero securities. So, um,

616
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:14,410
what are they trying to make

617
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,160
surmise?

618
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:20,160
They're trying to maximize one half
log y plus one quarter log z up

619
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,700
plus one quarter logs.
He there.

620
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,360
That's what they're trying to do.

621
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,330
Okay, so now what do they have
to, what do we have to do?

622
00:38:34,331 --> 00:38:39,160
We have to clear market in this market
given what the young are going to do in

623
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:42,700
the next period. But let's see what
this guy's going to do when he's young.

624
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:44,350
Everybody's going to face a similar,

625
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,440
basically a scaled up
version of this problem.

626
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,420
So this is what the guy's doing here.

627
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:53,190
He's got an income of three and
there's the price of up and down arrows

628
00:38:53,191 --> 00:38:56,650
securities that's going to tell them what
to consume here and what they consume.

629
00:38:56,651 --> 00:38:58,690
Plan to consume up here and down here.

630
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,673
Sure.

631
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:05,210
So utility function is the same one as
this I just multiplied through by a half,

632
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,340
right? So I put a half a quarter, a
quarter to get that. So that's the same,

633
00:39:10,341 --> 00:39:14,030
I'm just multiplied it all by a constant.
Okay,

634
00:39:14,031 --> 00:39:17,540
so now the coefficients add up to
one a half, a quarter and a quarter.

635
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,870
So what is the guy who,
that's his budget constraints.

636
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:22,430
But what's the budget constraint
going to be of a guy down here?

637
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,990
It's exactly the same.

638
00:39:23,991 --> 00:39:28,910
He's going to maximize the same utility
function and as budget constraint is

639
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,370
since the prices of the Arrow security,
so the same,

640
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,390
the only difference is going to be
that he's only got three halves here.

641
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,660
Okay,
so they're pretty similar problems.

642
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:41,910
So let's see what the guy at time
one is going to do. That's going to

643
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:47,030
ply that y equals Cobb dog
was a half times his income.

644
00:39:48,811 --> 00:39:53,010
Three divided by the price of y,

645
00:39:53,011 --> 00:39:56,280
which is just one what?
Half of three over one,

646
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:59,280
which is three halves.

647
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,873
Yes.

648
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:05,030
Okay.
And what's he going to do when he's old?

649
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,880
Z up is going to be while is Cobb dog.
This is a quarter.

650
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,260
Okay.
And then his income

651
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:18,410
still three and then the price is p up
of the ERL security and won the down

652
00:40:19,981 --> 00:40:24,900
case.
He's going to have a porter times three.

653
00:40:24,901 --> 00:40:29,880
That's his income divided by p down.
Okay,

654
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:33,910
so to clear this market,
what do we have to do?

655
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:39,310
We have to clear the market by
doing what? Z up. That's this guy.

656
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:40,900
So one quarter.

657
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,460
So this is the old guy
times three divided by p up.

658
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:51,150
That's what this guy wants to consume
up here plus what the young are going to

659
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:55,810
do there. But we know what the
younger going to do here. This guy,

660
00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:00,460
this young person is doing exactly what
this guy did except instead of having a

661
00:41:00,461 --> 00:41:03,310
starting well for three as
a starting wealth of six,

662
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,160
so instead of consuming young three house,

663
00:41:06,161 --> 00:41:09,880
he's going to consume young six halves.
So this is going to be plus three

664
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,470
he's going to consume half of his wages
just like this guy consumed half of his

665
00:41:16,471 --> 00:41:19,770
way just when he was young. So
this old, this new young guy,

666
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:23,460
the young guys are always going to
consume in the first period half of what

667
00:41:23,461 --> 00:41:27,540
their wages are. That's what this equation
tells us. If this is your budget set,

668
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:30,660
this is your income,
this is what your budget said is,

669
00:41:30,661 --> 00:41:34,100
and this is what you're maximizing.
This is very special Cobb

670
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,520
Douglas Case where you have
endowments only in one good.

671
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:42,470
So it's clear that in that good
you'll always consume the Cobb.

672
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:45,770
Doug was coefficient fraction of it,
a half of that.

673
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:50,771
So three halves and this guy's going to
consume a half of six which is three so

674
00:41:52,161 --> 00:41:55,370
the old appear are going
to consume that number.

675
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:59,840
The younger going to consume three and
what's the total that's available for

676
00:41:59,841 --> 00:42:00,800
them to consume?

677
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:07,990
What's available?

678
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,250
No more

679
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:18,640
eight but the young got six apples and
the de Lyon paid to apples in dividends.

680
00:42:20,911 --> 00:42:25,620
So the total number of apples is eight
so that's it.

681
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,960
And so we can solve that.

682
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:33,950
And that's going to imply that multiplying
that's five and multiplying by four

683
00:42:36,481 --> 00:42:38,730
is 20 so p you,

684
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,920
so I'm going to screw this up now.
P you is three over 20

685
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:46,923
yeah.

686
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,070
Okay.
Because if you put three over 20 in here,

687
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:55,110
you get the threes cancel and you get
20 over four which is five and five plus

688
00:42:55,111 --> 00:42:57,610
three is eight so it's three over 20 now,

689
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:02,070
meanwhile what are we going to have
in the upstate, in the upstate,

690
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,810
downstate. That was the
upstate. In the downstate.

691
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,553
MMM,

692
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,250
no, in the downstate. The
guy's going to do one quarter,

693
00:43:14,251 --> 00:43:17,760
three over PD. Okay. What is
this other guy going to do?

694
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,250
The young person here
is going to consume what

695
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,310
reigns on the downstate. What are we going
to have the equation on the downstate?

696
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,213
Okay,

697
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,560
it's going to be,
so this one,

698
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,420
one order three divided by p down.

699
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,720
Plus,
what's the,

700
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:42,970
what's this guy going to
consume when he's young? Well,

701
00:43:42,971 --> 00:43:47,280
his income is wages are three halves
and he's going to consume half of that.

702
00:43:47,281 --> 00:43:51,370
So it's three quarters.
All right?

703
00:43:51,371 --> 00:43:54,520
Because when you're young,
you always end up consuming half of your,

704
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:58,990
of your wages. So three quarters and
that has to equal, what's the total?

705
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:07,910
Two.
Two.

706
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:13,680
Okay, so what does that leave us?
That leaves us three quarters.

707
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:16,410
That's five fourths.
So let's see.

708
00:44:16,411 --> 00:44:21,411
So five fourths equals
three quarters over PD.

709
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:26,280
So PD is going to equal three fifths.

710
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:32,220
All right?
Cause the forest out and put PD

711
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,790
up on the five down. It's three
fifths. So that's it. So now we've got,

712
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:39,700
we figured out the prices.
So this Arrow security was a half and I'm,

713
00:44:39,701 --> 00:44:42,480
the probabilities are half half.
But the prices,

714
00:44:42,481 --> 00:44:46,890
the Arrow security prices are going to
be less than a half in more than a half.

715
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,200
Forgot what they were already.
Three 20th

716
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:56,250
three over 20 and three over
five those are the aero prices.

717
00:44:56,251 --> 00:44:59,940
By the way, you noticed they don't add
up to one. So what's the interest rate?

718
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:07,990
So if you want to get a riskless bond
pays one in each of these two states.

719
00:45:07,991 --> 00:45:09,220
So how much is that worth?

720
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,630
One over one plus r equals you
have to buy both Errol securities.

721
00:45:13,631 --> 00:45:17,080
We've done this before.
Three 20th plus three fifths,

722
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:22,710
which equals 15 20th equals three fours.

723
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:26,770
So therefore one plus
r equals four thirds.

724
00:45:26,771 --> 00:45:28,900
So it's ours is 33%

725
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,850
okay. So that's when we did,
we've got the probabilities,

726
00:45:33,851 --> 00:45:36,490
three 20th and three fifths justice.

727
00:45:36,491 --> 00:45:40,120
We thought the price of the down Arrow
security is going to be much bigger than

728
00:45:40,121 --> 00:45:41,530
the price of the apparel security.

729
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:45,070
Even though objectively they have
50 50 probability. And why is that?

730
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:49,330
Because everyone who's rational is going
to realize that they have to plan to

731
00:45:49,331 --> 00:45:52,240
consume much more up here than down here.

732
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:55,390
But they're not going to want to do
that unless the price is much cheaper.

733
00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:00,280
Okay? So that's how we got the price.
And now what's the price of land?

734
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,530
That's the only last thing
we have to figure out.

735
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:04,340
So the price of land.

736
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,260
So the price of land at
time one equals what?

737
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:14,890
Well, what if you buy
the land? What do you get

738
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:17,913
with?

739
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:22,900
You get three 20th then you
get the dividend, which is too,

740
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,390
but then you get to sell the land,
which just p uh,

741
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:29,650
land up.

742
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:35,800
Okay. And then plus if you get
the downstate, you get a dividend.

743
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:39,550
So the downstate has is
worth three fifths to you,

744
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,870
right? And then what do you
get? What's your dividend?

745
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:50,900
A half plus the price of the
land you can sell p laying down.

746
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,100
Okay, so that's what the
price of land is it one.

747
00:46:59,101 --> 00:47:02,160
It depends of course on what you can
sell the plant price of land for in the

748
00:47:02,161 --> 00:47:02,994
future.

749
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:08,300
But we made a guess here that the price
of land is just proportional to the

750
00:47:08,491 --> 00:47:12,630
price of, of the, uh, dividend.

751
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:15,540
So whenever the price of land is here,
when the dividend is one,

752
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:19,230
it should be twice as high here and
half as high here. So therefore,

753
00:47:19,231 --> 00:47:22,740
this instead of looking at
is the price of land went up,

754
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:26,460
it's going to be the price twice. The
price of land was at the very beginning.

755
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:31,360
So it's just two times the price of land
at the beginning times that same price.

756
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,560
And this price of winded
down the dividends half.

757
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:38,980
So the land is sort of half as good from
here on out as it was in the beginning.

758
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:42,820
So let's guess the price of land is
half of what it was at the beginning.

759
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:47,260
Yeah.

760
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:51,490
Okay. But now you see we've just got p
land in terms of other stuff and so we can

761
00:47:51,491 --> 00:47:54,070
solve for it.
So the price of land

762
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:58,440
is going to equal,
well now it's complicated.

763
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,330
So three tens

764
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:06,830
plus three tens times
the price of land plus,

765
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:10,110
um,
three tens

766
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,730
plus three tens times the price of land.

767
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:16,891
Okay.

768
00:48:16,891 --> 00:48:21,891
And so that means the price of land
minus six 10 so four times four tenths,

769
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:22,830
the price of one

770
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:23,663
lan

771
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:28,380
is going to equal six tens.

772
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,870
So the price of land is three
halves at the beginning.

773
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:36,493
Yeah.

774
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:41,650
Okay. So we figured out the price
of land here. Price of land,

775
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:45,760
price of land is three halves
at the very beginning. Okay.

776
00:48:45,761 --> 00:48:49,960
So we've saw for the whole equilibrium,
it took a long time. But I'm, I'm in,

777
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:54,880
I'm at the end of the story now. Um,
so let's just review what we did. Okay.

778
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,360
And so I don't think it's
that complicated a story.

779
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,900
The story is that you've got
land which has risky dividends.

780
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:07,890
So instead of having one straight
line of what can happen in the future,

781
00:49:08,261 --> 00:49:10,630
we've got this infinitely expanding tree.

782
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,510
So it's very hard to imagine solving it.

783
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:16,570
But then we've built in so
much special assumptions,

784
00:49:16,571 --> 00:49:20,380
we've got all this homogeneous and that
allows us to solve it because it's the

785
00:49:20,381 --> 00:49:24,640
same problem getting repeated over and
over again, just like we did before.

786
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,430
So the price of land turns
out to be three halves.

787
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:29,620
So what is this guy going to do?

788
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,633
Okay,

789
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:34,870
he's going to take his land,
his income,

790
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:38,020
which is three eat half of it,
which was three halves.

791
00:49:38,021 --> 00:49:39,940
That's what we said he
always does when he's young.

792
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:43,690
Spent half the consumption
halfers income on consumption,

793
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:47,740
the rest of his income, three
halves. He used to buy all the land.

794
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:51,040
Now with the land,
he gets a pay off of two.

795
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,880
Okay buddy gets to sell the land.
Now for double the price,

796
00:49:54,881 --> 00:49:59,380
he bought it mainly for three.
So two plus three is five and that,

797
00:49:59,381 --> 00:50:00,011
by the way,

798
00:50:00,011 --> 00:50:04,510
the price of up was three
20th so this is five right?

799
00:50:04,511 --> 00:50:06,700
Cause I put in three 20th some here.

800
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,780
That's the Arrow price of opt and Z up
is going to be five and so that's exactly

801
00:50:10,781 --> 00:50:12,190
how we got it with the land.

802
00:50:12,191 --> 00:50:15,130
He gets the dividend of two plus he
sells the land for three. That's five.

803
00:50:15,131 --> 00:50:17,950
So he does consume five z down.
Incidentally,

804
00:50:17,951 --> 00:50:20,350
the price of down was three fifths.

805
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:21,620
Okay,

806
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,420
so the consumption of down,

807
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,110
what's consumption of down?
I'm going to be

808
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,640
five. Four, thank you. Price,
there'll be five. Four.

809
00:50:31,641 --> 00:50:35,300
So let's say that that's going to work
out too. So the guy buys the land,

810
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:38,270
he gets his dividend of a half,

811
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:41,960
and then he sells the land
for half of this price,

812
00:50:41,961 --> 00:50:43,310
which is three quarters and a half,

813
00:50:43,311 --> 00:50:46,640
plus three quarters is five for us exactly
what we supposed to have. So you see,

814
00:50:46,641 --> 00:50:50,090
it works out that everybody's
doing exactly what they're
supposed to in all the

815
00:50:50,091 --> 00:50:52,130
markets are clearing.
Anyhow,

816
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:55,130
the point is not so much the numbers.

817
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:59,660
The point is the following that
sure enough, just as we said before,

818
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:03,170
the price of Arrow securities are going
to be expensive when things are going

819
00:51:03,171 --> 00:51:05,570
down and cheap when things are going up.

820
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:10,840
The upshot of that is the return on on
stocks like land is going to be very

821
00:51:12,141 --> 00:51:15,200
high. You put in three halves, okay,

822
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:18,260
what happens with the three
halves with probability a half?

823
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:23,600
That's what you put in with probability
a half, you get two plus three or five,

824
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:28,580
you get a, you get to, plus you get to
sell the land for three, which is five.

825
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:33,080
And with the other probability a
half, you get to the, the, the, uh,

826
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:36,710
dividends is a half,
plus you sell the land for three quarters,

827
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:41,180
that's what you're eating. Five and
five floors, that's equal to, you know,

828
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:46,130
five halves plus, um, plus five,

829
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:50,780
force plus five. I don't know what
this is. Five forest, what is this?

830
00:51:50,781 --> 00:51:55,520
One half plus three quarters is five.
Four turns a half. It's five eighths,

831
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:59,010
okay. Divided by three halves.
So this is a very high number.

832
00:51:59,011 --> 00:52:01,220
So what is this four times that,

833
00:52:01,221 --> 00:52:06,221
that's 25 over eight 25 over
eight divided by three over two,

834
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:11,360
which is, uh, it's what?

835
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:15,290
25 over 12?
Is that what you said?

836
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:16,850
Okay.

837
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:19,940
25 over 12 and just believing in out,
okay,

838
00:52:19,941 --> 00:52:22,910
so that is over 200%,
right?

839
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:26,600
So your return is 100% whatever you,
whatever you put in,

840
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:29,330
you more than doubled
your money in expectation.

841
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,080
Whereas the interest rate we said
was 33 and a third percent. Okay?

842
00:52:33,081 --> 00:52:36,140
So of course you're getting a tremendous
return by putting your money into

843
00:52:36,141 --> 00:52:40,310
capital because that's the whole point
of the theory. You're going, it's risky.

844
00:52:40,311 --> 00:52:43,310
The whole economy is going to, you
know, be rich or poor together.

845
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,770
So they're going to the price
of capital on the margin.

846
00:52:45,771 --> 00:52:46,910
It's a very risky thing to do.

847
00:52:46,911 --> 00:52:50,180
It just adds to this
inequality in your consumption.

848
00:52:50,181 --> 00:52:53,090
So the price is going to be low,
you're going to get a very high return.

849
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:56,240
That's all I want it to do.
I just solved it out concretely.

850
00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:00,650
So you can see very clearly that you get
a high return in the good state and uh,

851
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,220
you get a high return on capital, much
higher than the riskless rate of interest.

852
00:53:04,221 --> 00:53:07,190
So there we are, we're back at the
beginning now where George Bush,

853
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:11,570
we can see that somewhere in the middle
here, things are really disastrous.

854
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:13,970
These people who are
getting social security,

855
00:53:13,971 --> 00:53:18,740
which means they're getting a fixed amount
here in here, are doing really badly,

856
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:23,630
at least an expected return compared to
what they would do in the stock market.

857
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:26,040
Okay.
And so what should

858
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:31,020
we do about that? And is it true that, um,

859
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:34,830
just because stocks make a higher return,
it's a,

860
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,300
we should privatized. So
what do you think now? Where,

861
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,670
where are we in this argument?
Has Anything materially changed?

862
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,353
Okay.

863
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:48,100
Okay.
So George Bush is saying,

864
00:53:48,101 --> 00:53:51,700
and many Republicans say that we should,

865
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:55,210
we should let people, you know,
get them invested in stocks.

866
00:53:55,211 --> 00:53:58,570
There's a higher expected return.
So what do we think about that?

867
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:11,170
What do you think about that?

868
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,550
Okay.
And this is a real policy issue here.

869
00:54:25,551 --> 00:54:29,660
We've got this problem in America
right now. We've got this huge deficit.

870
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,430
And in social security,
you know,

871
00:54:31,431 --> 00:54:34,730
the rate of return is gotten
really poor for your generation.

872
00:54:34,731 --> 00:54:37,130
You're looking forward to
not making very much money.

873
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,970
And now we know theoretically
confirming what we seen in the past,

874
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:43,820
stocks are making higher
returns than bonds.

875
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:49,150
And social security is paying people
a fraction of the wages of the young.

876
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:53,870
And uh, you know, so what do we, you know,

877
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,330
so let me remind you the arguments.
So,

878
00:54:56,331 --> 00:55:01,280
but the issue has come up because
social security is running out of money.

879
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:03,440
So it came up because of this problem.

880
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:07,070
You know there's going to be a deficit
if we continue to pay people the same

881
00:55:07,071 --> 00:55:08,990
rules that we've used up until now,

882
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,480
we're not going to be able to
afford to do it much longer.

883
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:16,520
So we're going to have to lower what we
pay the the people going forward or else

884
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:18,740
differ in a lower,
in some clever way.

885
00:55:18,741 --> 00:55:22,520
Like they don't get money till they're
older instead of 65 way make them wait

886
00:55:22,521 --> 00:55:25,460
till 70 or do something
like that to pay them less.

887
00:55:25,461 --> 00:55:29,180
That's one way of balancing things and
the reason and because we're going to

888
00:55:29,181 --> 00:55:30,290
have to make changes like that.

889
00:55:30,291 --> 00:55:34,940
That's why the whole issue
of social security's come
up and we've now, you know,

890
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:38,180
deeper thinkers are questioning
the whole idea of social security.

891
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:42,230
So let me just remind you that America
was ahead of everyone in the world.

892
00:55:42,231 --> 00:55:46,820
When we created social security under
Roosevelt, nobody had anything like it.

893
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:51,290
Then everybody in the US rest of the
world gradually copied us and now

894
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,750
everybody's facing the
same problem we are,

895
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:56,720
which we know why you have to face it.
You're giving away stuff to the people.

896
00:55:56,721 --> 00:55:57,554
At the beginning.

897
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:02,590
And so they're facing it by changing
social security in some crazy way or

898
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:06,620
another. And we haven't changed anything
at all. But obviously we have to,

899
00:56:06,621 --> 00:56:09,620
and my question is how should we change
it and what's the right thing to do?

900
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,060
And just to remind you again of the issues
the Democrats and Republicans seem to

901
00:56:14,061 --> 00:56:18,950
be totally opposed to each other.
The Democrats say,

902
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:20,840
Oh, we want to, you know,

903
00:56:20,841 --> 00:56:25,810
continue to give people who have done
poorly in their lives a better deal on

904
00:56:25,811 --> 00:56:30,070
social security because we
want, we want to, uh, you know,

905
00:56:30,071 --> 00:56:34,090
we want to redistribute, we want to
help the poor. The Republicans actually,

906
00:56:34,091 --> 00:56:37,360
some of them agree with that, but some of
them don't agree with that. But anyway,

907
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:40,270
even the ones who agreed,
that's not the most important thing.

908
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:42,040
They think of what in social security.

909
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:46,840
Then the Democrats say social security
is so important because, you know,

910
00:56:46,841 --> 00:56:51,460
we're sharing risks across generation.
We don't want, uh, you know,

911
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,920
if the next generation has poor wages.

912
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:57,520
So they ended up down here with bad wages,
you know,

913
00:56:57,521 --> 00:57:00,550
the economy takes a turn
south with bad wages.

914
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:03,400
Then the old people should
suffer along with them.

915
00:57:03,401 --> 00:57:05,770
And if the young do better
with high wages cause thing,

916
00:57:05,771 --> 00:57:09,550
what's went up then like the old
should also get better social security

917
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:14,410
dividends. And that's what the current
situation promises. Okay. The, um,

918
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:20,650
the, uh, it's also indexed according to
inflation. All right? So once you retire,

919
00:57:20,651 --> 00:57:22,840
then you're protected
against changes in inflation.

920
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,060
And then another important
thing of Democrats,

921
00:57:25,061 --> 00:57:26,920
you don't have an opportunity
to make a mistake.

922
00:57:26,921 --> 00:57:29,100
If you invest in stocks and
stuff like that, you know,

923
00:57:29,101 --> 00:57:31,180
in the stock market suddenly collapses.

924
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,330
You're not going to lose money in
social security because social security

925
00:57:34,331 --> 00:57:36,790
depends on the wage of
the next generation.

926
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:39,430
And that moves much slower than the stock.
Okay.

927
00:57:39,431 --> 00:57:43,150
The Republicans on the other hand
say, you know, this is just terrible.

928
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:46,000
Nobody knows what their property
rights are in social security.

929
00:57:46,001 --> 00:57:48,760
No one actually understands how much
money they're getting when they're old.

930
00:57:48,761 --> 00:57:50,740
They just know now it's going to be bad.

931
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:53,680
And it compared to what they're paying
in taxes, but they don't even know.

932
00:57:53,681 --> 00:57:57,370
You don't even know what it is.
So how can that be good? And, uh,

933
00:57:57,371 --> 00:58:01,750
so it's not transparent and not only that,
whatever you think it is now,

934
00:58:01,751 --> 00:58:04,900
it's going to turn out to be worse because
in 10 years somebody's going to say

935
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:07,690
all the systems not balanced.
We have to, you know,

936
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:11,290
delay benefits or something to put it
back into balance and we're going to take

937
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:14,950
away what you thought you were going to
get. So Republicans say that's horrible.

938
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,930
Nobody knows really exactly what it is.

939
00:58:16,931 --> 00:58:18,970
And they get an idea of what it
might be and then they always,

940
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:21,430
but it can always be taken away.
Okay.

941
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:24,970
Really what they want to know is what's
the value of my social security account

942
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:27,570
and I want it to be mine. And then, uh,

943
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:30,280
I can also then tell what the
redistribution is. You know,

944
00:58:30,281 --> 00:58:34,390
if I know what I'm paying in taxes and I
know that the value of the benefits I'm

945
00:58:34,391 --> 00:58:37,540
getting, I can see that my taxes
are much more than my benefits.

946
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,600
And if I happen to be a nice guy
and think it's a good idea to have

947
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:43,870
redistribution, fine. But if I'm
a bad, you know, not a bad guy.

948
00:58:43,871 --> 00:58:45,880
If I just don't believe in
that much redistribution,

949
00:58:45,881 --> 00:58:48,820
I should be aware of it and have
the chance to vote against it. Okay.

950
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:53,820
And also a key thing is these
Republicans say people should get equity,

951
00:58:53,951 --> 00:58:58,360
like returns, not this wages in the
next generation. Those grows slowly.

952
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,240
Stocks might have a much higher return.
On average,

953
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:04,720
people should get equity like returns.
So let's put them in the stock market.

954
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:08,260
And then Republicans think
choice is always great. You know,

955
00:59:08,261 --> 00:59:11,500
even if people make mistakes, it's their
own mistakes. So let them make mistakes.

956
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:14,290
So those are the opposite
sides of the argument.

957
00:59:14,291 --> 00:59:18,700
They seem totally at odds with each
other and impossible to reconcile.

958
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,110
So I want to now tell my plan of rec.

959
00:59:22,111 --> 00:59:24,410
So everyone's got the problem straight.

960
00:59:24,411 --> 00:59:28,910
We're running out of money and the
philosophies of the two groups seem to be

961
00:59:28,911 --> 00:59:32,330
totally opposed. So what should
we do about it? All right,

962
00:59:32,331 --> 00:59:35,690
so my plan in five minutes because
I want to end with black shoals,

963
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,240
my plan in five minutes is

964
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:39,463
mmm,

965
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:45,610
okay. To make a few
observations. First of all, yes,

966
00:59:45,611 --> 00:59:49,510
it's true that you get a
higher return on stocks,

967
00:59:49,511 --> 00:59:52,750
then you get on bonds,
but you face a higher risk.

968
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:57,340
So it's not like you get it for free. It's
a, you know, it's a bigger risk. And so,

969
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:59,170
um, okay, so that's number one.

970
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:04,350
So you don't actually number 0.0 is
you still got the problem because you,

971
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,560
you gave money to all those people in
the forties and the 50s and the 60s and

972
01:00:08,561 --> 01:00:11,140
the 70s that money's gone. We
have to something, you know,

973
01:00:11,141 --> 01:00:14,470
we've essentially borrowed to give them
money and somebody's got to pay back

974
01:00:14,471 --> 01:00:16,960
that debt.
And so there's no way around that.

975
01:00:16,961 --> 01:00:21,961
There's this huge $17 trillion
debt hanging out there
that we have to pay back.

976
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:23,560
And you can't get around that.

977
01:00:23,561 --> 01:00:25,990
So putting the money into equities
or wherever you put the money,

978
01:00:25,991 --> 01:00:28,510
there's still that tremendous debt.
Now the question is,

979
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:32,020
so you can't just make the problem go
away by saying that equities have a higher

980
01:00:32,021 --> 01:00:34,090
return. Stocks also have, I mean,

981
01:00:34,091 --> 01:00:37,330
bonds also have a higher return than
the return people are getting on social

982
01:00:37,331 --> 01:00:41,650
security because the social
security return includes
the tax that you're paying,

983
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:46,090
you know, to, to make up for the
original generation. So, okay,

984
01:00:46,091 --> 01:00:49,690
so that's the first thing.
So the next thing is, um,

985
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:55,150
maybe it's not such a big difference,
you know, this equities and not equities,

986
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:58,750
because notice in this model
you don't,

987
01:00:58,870 --> 01:01:03,730
when the stock is paying higher on the
stock dividends or higher two instead of

988
01:01:03,731 --> 01:01:07,630
one, the price of stocks goes up. That's
a great return from the stock market.

989
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:12,010
But the wages were also higher
here as well. So in fact,

990
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:15,470
I clean that in the long run.
And it's amazing people who,

991
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:19,810
those Republicans haven't noticed this
in the long run you over 30 or 40 years,

992
01:01:19,811 --> 01:01:23,530
it's obvious that the stock market and
wages are pretty close, are correlated.

993
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:27,320
I mean, you know, if the stock
market collapses, you know,

994
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:29,710
that's disaster for
America and sh you know,

995
01:01:29,711 --> 01:01:33,580
you can be sure the wages are going to
go down to if our stock market's booming

996
01:01:33,581 --> 01:01:37,720
in America's incredibly successful,
it's a sure thing that in 40 years,

997
01:01:37,721 --> 01:01:41,800
if the stock market is just booming along,
wages are going to be higher as well.

998
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:46,510
So if you get the wages of the
generation 30 years from now, you know,

999
01:01:46,511 --> 01:01:51,400
in the, in the democratic plan you are
actually getting equity like returns,

1000
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:53,290
but you're getting an advantage,

1001
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:58,470
which is that the wages move slowly so
of all the stocks are bouncing up and

1002
01:01:58,541 --> 01:02:02,200
down.
So somebody who retired in the year 2007,

1003
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:05,320
if he held stock and sold
that when he retired,

1004
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:09,790
he could get a huge pension where
someone who retired in 2008, uh,

1005
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:11,650
and sold the stock just when he retired,

1006
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:15,430
he would be crushed because
the stock market lost 50% okay.

1007
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:18,880
So that will never happen if you just
pay according to wages because they're

1008
01:02:18,881 --> 01:02:20,460
much stable.
All right?

1009
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:24,060
But wages in the long run are
correlated with stocks in the long run,

1010
01:02:24,061 --> 01:02:28,530
in the short run, they just
don't fluctuate as much.
So, so what it was my plan.

1011
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:31,920
Okay. So those are just some preliminary
observations and I'll give you the plan.

1012
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:34,980
Okay. And then as I said, this
is obviously controversial.

1013
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:40,070
I think I've identified the problem in
a scientific way that is everyone who,

1014
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:45,360
you know, would agree with me if
they, if they knew enough economics.

1015
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:49,530
But now my plan, even people who do know
as much as me might disagree with me,

1016
01:02:49,531 --> 01:02:54,240
but I, I, okay, but so this is what I
would, uh, okay. So here's the plan.

1017
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:57,240
Okay. As I said, other plans
just say, well, things are bad.

1018
01:02:57,241 --> 01:03:00,780
Let's just keep the same system.
And so there are two basic ideas.

1019
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,760
The democratic ideas,

1020
01:03:02,761 --> 01:03:06,210
let's just keep adjusting at the margin
will make up for it by giving people

1021
01:03:06,211 --> 01:03:10,530
money later. We'll do all kinds of things
like that. Maybe we'll raise some taxes,

1022
01:03:10,531 --> 01:03:12,660
reduced some benefits,
balanced the system,

1023
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:17,070
the Republicans want to junk the whole
thing and privatized and let people,

1024
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,760
you know, force them to save. But put it
in the stock market, in their own account.

1025
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:25,700
Okay, now here's my plan. Um,

1026
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:28,830
I don't have time to talk
about bushes plan. Um,

1027
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:31,613
okay.

1028
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,960
So here's my plan.
Number one,

1029
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:38,340
the fact that we gave all this money
away to people in the forties and 50s and

1030
01:03:38,341 --> 01:03:43,080
60s and 70s, why should that
be the responsibility of the,

1031
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:48,150
um, the workers today? I mean, our
government decided it was a good idea.

1032
01:03:48,151 --> 01:03:52,230
Roosevelt and Frances Perkins decided
we had to rescue the old of the forties

1033
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:56,310
and our congresses kept that
up for the next 20, 30 years.

1034
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:59,370
Even though the old Warrington's
such dire shape, but they kept up,

1035
01:03:59,371 --> 01:04:01,770
maybe it was not a good idea.
It's probably a very good idea.

1036
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:03,510
But because we have that huge debt,

1037
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:07,560
why should workers be the only people
responsible for paying back that debt?

1038
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:12,540
I would start by imposing a legacy
tax on everybody. You know, um,

1039
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:14,490
not for social security,

1040
01:04:14,491 --> 01:04:18,720
just for the debt we accumulated by
giving it to those old generations.

1041
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:23,340
So I believe that would be something
like 1%. Uh, I wrote two to 3%,

1042
01:04:23,341 --> 01:04:28,210
but I think it's closer to 1% actually on
all income. If I did it on all Lincoln,

1043
01:04:28,211 --> 01:04:33,211
we'd be like 1% and that fun would pay
off for the social security legacy.

1044
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:38,730
So then if we were starting the system
of fresh, how should we do it? Okay.

1045
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:39,930
So,
um,

1046
01:04:39,931 --> 01:04:42,810
and that's some countries like Chile
decided they're going to start a fresh.

1047
01:04:42,811 --> 01:04:44,460
So how should we start a fresh,

1048
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:49,410
having gotten rid of this old debt
that was hanging over our heads? Well,

1049
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:55,270
um, uh, where does, what would I do?

1050
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:58,810
I would have what I call
progressive personal accounts.

1051
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:03,010
So I like all the Republican
ideas of knowing what you've got,

1052
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:05,920
making it yours and making it transparent.

1053
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:07,960
I think that's all an extremely good idea.

1054
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:12,560
But why should it be that that comes from
putting your money into stocks? I mean,

1055
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:13,061
stocks,

1056
01:05:13,061 --> 01:05:16,390
this is an old fashioned security and
it's incredibly risky from one year to the

1057
01:05:16,391 --> 01:05:20,820
next. That totally, I like the
idea of Shit, you know, of a,

1058
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:22,980
of indexing something to wages.

1059
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:27,520
So I want to create a new security that
I call personal annuitized average wage

1060
01:05:27,521 --> 01:05:29,410
security.
So what this does,

1061
01:05:29,411 --> 01:05:33,580
this is the security that just pays
proportional to the wage in the whole

1062
01:05:33,581 --> 01:05:37,720
country at the year you
retire. So whenever you, uh,

1063
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:41,350
earn money on social security, so I'm
running out of time, so I don't want to,

1064
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:45,940
I'm going to skip over this
pretty quickly. So if you
earn a dollar and you pay,

1065
01:05:45,970 --> 01:05:49,930
let's say 12% and social security's taxes,
that income,

1066
01:05:49,931 --> 01:05:53,920
now I'm going to, um, that income,

1067
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:56,920
I'm going to say that's your
income. Okay? It's your 12%,

1068
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:58,550
you're going to be forced to save it.

1069
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:02,710
And what you're forced to do
is to buy these securities.

1070
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,610
So it's a new kind of security
that pays proportional to the wage.

1071
01:06:06,611 --> 01:06:11,290
So it might pay 10, you know, 1% of the
average way. So We'd pay 12 cents here,

1072
01:06:11,291 --> 01:06:14,200
30 cents here,
and three quarters of a scent there.

1073
01:06:14,201 --> 01:06:18,160
That's the wage and the economy and
would pay, you know, 1% of that.

1074
01:06:18,161 --> 01:06:22,150
And how much of it when you get to buy
as much as you could afford to buy with

1075
01:06:22,151 --> 01:06:24,850
your security,
with your tax contribution.

1076
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:29,260
Now that almost replicates
the current system.

1077
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:33,970
The only difference is that, um, it
doesn't replicate the current system.

1078
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:35,590
There's nothing progressive about it yet.

1079
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:38,830
So what I would do is I would make
it a progressive tax. You know,

1080
01:06:38,831 --> 01:06:41,050
if you're making a hugely high income,

1081
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:44,290
I wouldn't give you the whole
12% I would take part of it.

1082
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,270
And if you're making a really low income,

1083
01:06:46,450 --> 01:06:49,030
I would have the government
subsidize it a little bit.

1084
01:06:49,031 --> 01:06:53,260
So instead of getting 12% of your low
income, you'd get a little more than 12%.

1085
01:06:53,261 --> 01:06:56,350
If you had a high income,
you're 12% tax, you know,

1086
01:06:56,351 --> 01:06:59,590
some of the government would take one
of those 12 away from you and you'd only

1087
01:06:59,591 --> 01:07:04,270
have 11% that you got to put in your
personal account. Okay. And then, um, now,

1088
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:07,270
but it has a tremendous
advantage the system,

1089
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,820
which is that if you can price the pause,

1090
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:14,200
if you know what the market price of
pauses, then you're balancing the system.

1091
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:17,530
Okay. Because every time
you hand somebody money,

1092
01:07:17,531 --> 01:07:20,410
you don't make some crazy promise
that when you get to be old,

1093
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,090
I'm going to pay you
such and such dollars.

1094
01:07:22,091 --> 01:07:26,440
Like the current system is you're
letting the guy or the woman,

1095
01:07:26,441 --> 01:07:30,730
let's say who's working, she's buying
her own social security benefits.

1096
01:07:30,731 --> 01:07:35,110
So the, the, the, the benefits have an
equal value to what she's paying for.

1097
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:38,870
So you've balanced the system,
you know from the, the,

1098
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:43,880
the legacy tax you got rid of by having
the tax on everybody have one or 2% and

1099
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,850
the uh,
the uh,

1100
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:49,360
balancing system going
forward is occurring because
you're forcing people to buy

1101
01:07:49,361 --> 01:07:53,680
their social security benefits. So anyway,
that's my, in a nutshell, my system.

1102
01:07:53,681 --> 01:07:57,280
And the last thing is how are you going
to get pause priced by the market? Well,

1103
01:07:57,281 --> 01:08:00,160
I'm going to get the market to trade them
and I think that would be a tremendous

1104
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:05,320
boon to the economy if we had
these securities paid. Why is that?

1105
01:08:05,321 --> 01:08:08,290
Because they're tremendous.
Okay. So how would I do that?

1106
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:11,830
I'd force everybody to
invest only in pause,

1107
01:08:11,831 --> 01:08:14,860
which I claim her likes stocks in
the long run, but in the short run,

1108
01:08:14,861 --> 01:08:17,150
they're risky.
So it's a better investment vehicle,

1109
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:21,530
but they have to sell exactly 10%
of their paws into the market.

1110
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:24,650
And with that 10% of money they could
hold stocks or whatever else they wanted

1111
01:08:24,651 --> 01:08:29,651
to and those 10% would all be pooled
together and the traded in the market and

1112
01:08:29,691 --> 01:08:32,420
the market then would have
an idea of, you know, a,

1113
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:36,080
a new instrument to price what they
think future wages are going to be.

1114
01:08:36,081 --> 01:08:40,760
So anybody giving a pension plan that's
indexed a future wages would know what

1115
01:08:40,761 --> 01:08:42,140
the market price of those things are.

1116
01:08:42,141 --> 01:08:44,870
So it would dramatically help
pension plans as well. Anyway,

1117
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:48,350
that's my idea of the,
uh, for social security.

1118
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:53,800
So I have four minutes left and I
want to end with one last thought.

1119
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:59,030
Okay. One last idea,
which is black shoals.

1120
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:02,990
Now we've already done black
Sholes and a few problem sets.

1121
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:06,440
So what is the idea of black shoals?

1122
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:10,320
It's just like the idea of the
example we gave. By the way, you know,

1123
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:13,970
if you do come next week and you want
to question me about my social security

1124
01:09:13,971 --> 01:09:18,920
plan and criticize it, I'd be
thrilled to be criticized because, um,

1125
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:21,680
you know, you can't learn anything
unless you're criticized. And I, I,

1126
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:24,740
I think I can defend it
too. But, uh, anyhow,

1127
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:27,770
this is an idea which obviously hasn't
caught on yet because social security

1128
01:09:27,771 --> 01:09:30,410
reforms stopped.
We've got worst problems to worry about,

1129
01:09:30,411 --> 01:09:31,970
but if we get through this crisis,

1130
01:09:31,971 --> 01:09:35,810
the very next thing on Obama's agenda is
going to be reforming social security.

1131
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:41,210
So I'm ready anyway. So
let me just end with, uh,

1132
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:45,830
with the black shoals. So
in 1972, black and shoals,

1133
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,190
uh, wrote a famous paper.
And what did they do?

1134
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,080
They started off by saying,

1135
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:54,560
this model we had you
see of the stock market,

1136
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:58,730
which follows a geometric random walk
and can go up by a certain percentage or

1137
01:09:58,731 --> 01:10:03,110
down by a certain percentage. We've
used that with interest rates to, okay,

1138
01:10:03,111 --> 01:10:05,000
they can go up or down
by a certain percentage.

1139
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:07,910
Here are the stocks can go up
or down by a certain percentage.

1140
01:10:07,911 --> 01:10:12,860
We saw that you could solve models like
that very easily. So black and shoals,

1141
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:17,810
Fisher black, who was a great economist
and Myron shoals who won the Nobel prize,

1142
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,540
but it was not as mathematical
as Fischer black. Anyway,

1143
01:10:20,541 --> 01:10:21,920
he started the hedge fund,

1144
01:10:21,921 --> 01:10:26,921
long capital fish of Myron shoals was
one of the people they looked in 1972 at

1145
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:33,070
the returns each day on the s and p
500 and they bend them up like this.

1146
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:37,100
So here are the number of times
the return was between, you know,

1147
01:10:37,101 --> 01:10:40,190
0.47% and some other number.
Okay.

1148
01:10:40,191 --> 01:10:44,420
And then they compared that to a normally
distributed random variable and look

1149
01:10:44,421 --> 01:10:47,510
how close to normally distributed
as it's practically like that.

1150
01:10:47,511 --> 01:10:50,000
So this thing over here
is the normally exactly,

1151
01:10:50,001 --> 01:10:53,340
normally distributed and this
is the frequency, you know,

1152
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:55,310
graph of what actually happened that year.

1153
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:57,500
Incredibly close to normally distributed.

1154
01:10:57,501 --> 01:11:00,950
And if you take the cumulative occurrence
of each thing and compare it to the

1155
01:11:00,951 --> 01:11:04,940
normal, it's incredibly close to
the normal. So they said, Gosh,

1156
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:09,380
isn't it great this model of things
going up or down by a certain percentage

1157
01:11:09,381 --> 01:11:10,820
every year?
Maybe with a drift.

1158
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,740
That's exactly the model of the
stock market seems to follow.

1159
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:17,250
And maybe interest rates fall
that thing sort of model too.

1160
01:11:17,251 --> 01:11:19,350
And that's why we've worked
with all those models.

1161
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:24,950
Well it turns out if you make those
assumptions and then you try to solve for

1162
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:30,750
uh, option prices, you can do it
very quickly through some formula,

1163
01:11:30,751 --> 01:11:34,830
which I'm not going to have time to
present, but so when we take one minute,

1164
01:11:34,831 --> 01:11:39,030
but I'm going to skip that. So
what happened then? So this,
so this, uh, so this, um,

1165
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:42,780
this was the second high point of,
you know,

1166
01:11:42,781 --> 01:11:46,170
there's the cap m model and
then the black Sholes model.

1167
01:11:46,171 --> 01:11:49,980
You've done problems with black Sholes
now and the problem set to figure out the

1168
01:11:49,981 --> 01:11:51,240
value of a call option.

1169
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,900
So I'm just pointing out that you could
put it in a spreadsheet like I've done,

1170
01:11:54,901 --> 01:11:58,890
which will be on the, on the web and
you can do, you know, for 10, you know,

1171
01:11:58,891 --> 01:12:02,850
daily returns and fix the
standard deviation and stuff
and do backward induction

1172
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:05,940
incredibly quickly and figure
out the value of the call option.

1173
01:12:05,941 --> 01:12:08,820
Even get a closed forum formula for it.
So that was,

1174
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:13,080
and then explain why call option
prices have the form that they do.

1175
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:16,170
So it was a great triumph and it
relied on their things being normally

1176
01:12:16,171 --> 01:12:18,600
distributed down to 30 seconds.

1177
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:23,780
So what happened if you do the same
thing recently so you do exactly the same

1178
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:29,010
thing and been everything up
like Fischer black did. Okay.

1179
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:32,070
Not 1972 shit,
sorry.

1180
01:12:32,071 --> 01:12:36,630
Not In 1972 but you know the last five
years, say they only did one year,

1181
01:12:36,631 --> 01:12:39,150
but you do the last fight.
Actually I did this a couple of years ago.

1182
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,550
So from seven years ago to two years ago,

1183
01:12:41,551 --> 01:12:45,330
if the pink thing is normally distributed
and we do the same binning that

1184
01:12:45,331 --> 01:12:49,630
blackened shoals did look everyday at
what the return is and sticking in a Ben

1185
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:53,310
and just do the frequency thing.
What do you see?

1186
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:58,050
You see that there are a lot more times
where in reality the move was very

1187
01:12:58,051 --> 01:13:02,850
small, but there are a lot more times
in reality where the move was very big.

1188
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:07,770
So this is precisely what you call
a fat tail, that you get mold,

1189
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:10,380
you know, smaller moves than
the normally distributed ones,

1190
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:13,860
but also bigger moves the normally
distributed one so you can have some big

1191
01:13:13,861 --> 01:13:18,090
negative moves. And so we know, we've said
I had some huge negative shocks. Okay.

1192
01:13:18,091 --> 01:13:23,091
So I'm ending now with this thought that
finance produced remarkable theories,

1193
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:26,850
remarkably precise predictions.

1194
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:31,410
And for decades at a time it seemed
those were born out in practice.

1195
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:36,390
But then looking back 50 years later
or 30 years later on these discoveries,

1196
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:40,620
we see that they don't do quite as well
as they seem to be doing at first glance.

1197
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:42,510
So some things missing in the theory.

1198
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:46,650
And I think the subject is so exciting
because it's so connected to the world.

1199
01:13:46,651 --> 01:13:51,150
You know, everybody talks about
finance nowadays, you can't,

1200
01:13:51,151 --> 01:13:52,260
I mean any dinner part,

1201
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:55,410
anyone in the world is spending half
their time thinking about finance.

1202
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:59,730
And the theory is still up in the
air because the old, you know,

1203
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:02,610
classics of the theory no longer hold.

1204
01:14:02,611 --> 01:14:05,610
And so it's an exciting time
to be developing a new theory,

1205
01:14:05,611 --> 01:14:07,230
and maybe you'll think
about it in the future.

1206
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:09,270
So I'll see you some of you next week.
