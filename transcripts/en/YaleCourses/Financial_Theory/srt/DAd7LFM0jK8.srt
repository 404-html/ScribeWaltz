1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,050
Okay, so time to start. So let me
begin by reviewing a little bit, uh,

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,230
the dynamic hedging,

3
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:11,640
which I could have described a
little bit more clearly last time.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,780
It's a very important idea and I
made a little bit of a mess of it.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,540
So let's say,
or I didn't make that big a mess of it,

6
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:21,780
but a little bit of a
mess of it. So let's, uh,

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,560
be a little bit careful now about
who knows what and what you're doing.

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,850
So we said,

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,910
imagine somebody who knows
that the probability the
Yankees are going to win the

10
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:37,050
world series is 60% and therefore the,
again,

11
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:40,890
each game of the world series
or 60% and knows that if he,

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,010
the probability the Phillies
win the game is 40%.

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,430
So suppose that he find somebody who's
willing to bet with him on the Phillies

14
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,030
so he can win $100.
If the Yankees wins,

15
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:57,030
he has to pay $100 of the Yankees lose.

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,980
Now his expected payoff is 20.
He should take the bat.

17
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,890
Because if the person's willing to bet on,
even at even odds,

18
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:08,220
the Phillies fans willing to bend it,
even odds, and he knows the odds are 60,

19
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:12,630
40 an expectation, he's going to make
20. So it's clear what he should do.

20
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,320
But the problem is he subject to risk.
And He,

21
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,160
although he's right about the odds,
he could still through,

22
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:24,330
even though he's done the smart thing,
he could still end up losing $100,

23
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,400
which could be a disaster for him.

24
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,380
So we we'd like to do is to hedge his
bets. And what does it mean hedges?

25
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:32,220
Bet.
Well,

26
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:36,750
suppose there was another bookie
who was willing to bet at 60,

27
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:41,370
40 odds in either direction,
then what should he do? Well,

28
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,630
if he could find another bookie who
was willing to bet at 60 40 odds,

29
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:50,870
he should try and lock in
a $60 $20 no matter what.

30
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,860
So he should, um, do this bet.

31
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,870
He should bet with the other bookie $80.
Uh,

32
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,880
he'd be willing to give up $80 if the
Yankees won in order to win a $120 if the

33
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:12,020
Phillies win. And that's a fair bet.
According to the other book, he,

34
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,800
because it's 60, 40 odds, 60% of
this and 40% of that or you know,

35
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:20,310
this is three to two odds. So it's a,
it's a fair bet. So in other words,

36
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,460
he makes money by taking advantage of
the Philly fan to bet on the Hankies,

37
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,170
but that subjects them to whip to risk.

38
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,890
So in order to minimize
the risk he hedges is bat.

39
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,540
That's where the expression came from.

40
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,660
He hedges that bat by betting in the
opposite direction on betting on the

41
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:43,020
Phillies with his bookie in the
opposite direction. But you know,

42
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,530
standing to lose less than he,
you know,

43
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,820
he's betting in this proportion and
this amount so that he gets 20 no matter

44
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:55,410
what. So He's locked in his $20 profit.
Okay, so that was where we began.

45
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,530
Now let's just think about it a little
bit more carefully than I did before.

46
00:02:58,531 --> 00:03:01,510
Somebody fact basically
asked this question,

47
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,790
is he really making money?

48
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,840
Because he understands better the
odds of the Yankees winning the game?

49
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,470
Is he making money? Because
he knows the odds are 60, 40,

50
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:15,160
and the poor Philly fan thinks
they're 50 50. The answer is no.

51
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,750
That's not why he's making money.

52
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,900
Doesn't matter what the odds
are of the Yankees winning,

53
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,350
he's winning because he's
managed to arbitrage,

54
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,670
to different betters, namely the
Philly fan and the other bookie.

55
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,280
And the fact that they
differ in their beliefs.

56
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:33,460
The fact that he can trade with
the bookie at three to two odds,

57
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:35,440
whatever bet he he wants.

58
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,790
And the Philly fan is a trading
at different odds with him.

59
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,160
That's what enables
him to make his profit.

60
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,780
So how did he make the arbitrage?
So what is an arbitrage?

61
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,850
An arbitrage as you find two bets,
uh,

62
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,840
which are more or less the same thing,
which in fact are exactly the same thing,

63
00:03:55,841 --> 00:04:00,760
but trade at a different price.
Okay. So what are the, uh,

64
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,990
what are the two bets? Well,
there's the Philly Bat,

65
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,460
the Philly Fan bet,

66
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,320
and then there's the bookie bat

67
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,070
plus borrowing $20

68
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,150
okay.
So if he's going to make 20 for sure.

69
00:04:27,151 --> 00:04:31,500
So he could make the 20 at the beginning
just by borrowing against his winnings.

70
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:36,390
Then he'd have 20 at the very
beginning and his payoffs would, uh,

71
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,420
you know,
would be it.

72
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:43,470
The payoffs from the Philly fan
bet would be exactly. He'd over 20,

73
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:47,100
so he'd have minus a hundred,
you know, so this bat is a,

74
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,690
he'd get 20 at the beginning.

75
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,520
He'd be able to get 20 to be anybody
to have to pay minus a hundred and a

76
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:56,780
hundred
okay.

77
00:04:56,781 --> 00:05:01,781
He'd pay $100 if the Yankees one
and get $100 if the Phillies won.

78
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,231
Okay.

79
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:14,231
And so that way he get he breast cancel
his bed at the end and end up with $20

80
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:17,090
for sure. Okay. So just to say it again,

81
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,960
he's made money apparently because he
knows more than the Philly fan knows.

82
00:05:20,961 --> 00:05:24,890
But actually in order to guarantee
that he doesn't run a risk,

83
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,390
he has to find another trader.
And,

84
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,460
and it's the presence of the other trader
who's willing to get really giving him

85
00:05:31,461 --> 00:05:32,510
his profit opportunity,

86
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:35,990
not as superior knowledge and the
fact that it's two different traders.

87
00:05:35,991 --> 00:05:38,270
And so why does that
give them an opportunity?

88
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:43,100
Because he can arrange a bet with a
Philly fan and a bet with the, uh,

89
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,910
bookie bookie, but
combined with a, you know,

90
00:05:46,911 --> 00:05:51,080
borrowing the money so
that in the end he's, uh,

91
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,630
he's gonna just get zero payoffs putting
together the Philly fan bet and the

92
00:05:56,631 --> 00:05:59,420
bookie bet and borrowing $20,

93
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,020
he gets $20 at the very
beginning and on net.

94
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,790
He has nothing at the end.

95
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,350
So whatever losses he got from the
Phillies he made up from the book,

96
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:10,160
he bet whatever losses
he had from the book,

97
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,770
he bet he made up for it
with the Philly fan bet.

98
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,040
So arbitrage relies on
replication somehow through some

99
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,550
other bet. He was able, he was
able to hedge his other bat,

100
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,520
is able to hedge his Phillies bat,
um,

101
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:33,550
by replicating the bet with somebody
else combined with borrowing to produce

102
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:35,200
exactly the same,
uh,

103
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,630
payoffs in the end or the negative
of the payoffs and the end.

104
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,950
And yet for a different price at the
beginning of the Philly fan didn't demand

105
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:46,520
any money up front to make this a
hundred minus hundred bet with him. And,

106
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,440
and with the a bookie, he's able
to get $20 up front and make this,

107
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:55,910
uh, you know, the opposite bet, the
minus hundred hundred bet. Okay.

108
00:06:55,911 --> 00:07:00,280
So by getting more money up front and
doing the opposite bet with the bookie,

109
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,030
he can end up completely cancelling
the Philly bet. Can we fan bet?

110
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,770
And that's how he makes us profit.
Okay. So, um, that was the first idea.

111
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:11,150
And so what have I clarified?

112
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,150
What I've clarified is that it
wasn't a superior knowledge.

113
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,200
It was the presence of two
different traders that enabled
him to make his profit.

114
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,230
And I've clarified the method
that he made the profit,

115
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,440
the profit wasn't just kind
of mixing in another bet.

116
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,300
It was really cleverly arranging
to undo totally the original bed.

117
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,980
Okay. So he got actually zero in the end.
It ended up with $20 at the beginning.

118
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:40,100
So let's just see now what you
would do in a dynamic situation.

119
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,623
Yes,

120
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,083
yes.

121
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:57,510
Why would he do what at all?
It seems like no matter what,

122
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,370
whether they win or lose together,

123
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,140
he didn't have $20 to begin with.
He had no dollars.

124
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:09,250
So he went and found the Philly fan and
he made a bet against the Philly fan

125
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,360
with no money.
Right.

126
00:08:10,361 --> 00:08:14,950
The Philly fan was ma was willing
to bet him $100 on the Phillies,

127
00:08:14,951 --> 00:08:17,800
so he gets a hundred if the Yankees
winning pays the fan a hundred if the

128
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:20,440
Phillies win,
it didn't cost him any money to do that.

129
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,190
Then he goes out and makes another
bet with the bookie. Again,

130
00:08:24,191 --> 00:08:27,790
it doesn't cost him any money.
He gives up $80 if the Yankees win,

131
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:31,480
but he gets 120 if the fillings win.
So he spent no money at all.

132
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:35,440
And his total profit is $20 for sure.
So what could he do?

133
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:37,990
Since he knows he's going to
make $20 for sure in the future,

134
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:39,430
he could just borrowed at the beginning.

135
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:42,280
If the interest rate zero
have $20 at the beginning,

136
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,470
end up with zero no matter what the
uncertainty is and put the $20 in his

137
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:51,820
pocket. So that that's, so that's
another way of saying the same thing,

138
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,700
which is that he could, by combining the
bets put as pocket in at the beginning.

139
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,620
And no matter what happens in the future,

140
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,890
he doesn't have to give anybody any
more money. So that's what he's done.

141
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:04,980
That's what an arbitrage is. You put
money in your pocket and in the future,

142
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,880
in the present, and in the future,
you never have to face a problem.

143
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,940
You've always got money
that's going out in one hand,

144
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:16,030
you're getting from the other hand.
Okay?

145
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:19,810
Now in a dynamic situation, you
can do the same thing. Okay?

146
00:09:19,811 --> 00:09:22,060
So I'm just reinterpreting what
we did before a little bit.

147
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,850
So in the dynamic situation,
what are you doing?

148
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:29,020
You've got the Philly fan now is
betting on the whole world series,

149
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,560
even though you know
the odds are 60 40 okay,

150
00:09:32,561 --> 00:09:35,950
so now it's an even worse
back by the Philly Fan. If
you're right about the odds,

151
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:39,220
because the chances are even higher that
the Yankees are going to win the series

152
00:09:39,221 --> 00:09:43,750
than one game. The odds we know
are 71% so by backward induction,

153
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:48,751
we did this calculation to say you're
expected payoff is $42 so let's suppose

154
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:53,080
now, but, but now the key
is that you're making money,

155
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:55,390
not just because you know
better what the odds are.

156
00:09:55,391 --> 00:09:59,470
You're making money because there's
another book he's standing there always

157
00:09:59,471 --> 00:10:03,340
ready to trade with you
at 60 40 odds on any game.

158
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,930
So the presence of the second book,
even if you knew nothing,

159
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,580
would enable you to make money in
this case, lock in a profit for sure.

160
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,870
A $42 now how do you know that
you can lock in a profit for sure.

161
00:10:16,871 --> 00:10:20,500
$42 well,
it's now done by dynamic hedging.

162
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,160
You have to

163
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,480
lay off part of your bat
a little part each day,

164
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,360
each game and the amount that you lay
off is going to depend on what happens.

165
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:35,230
So that's why it's dynamic.
It's a complicated calculation,

166
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,750
so it seems almost hopeless to
figure out what to do. You know,

167
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:42,970
like I'm betting on the whole series, you
know, many different things can happen.

168
00:10:42,971 --> 00:10:45,190
You know, the Phillies could
win the first game, the Yankees,

169
00:10:45,191 --> 00:10:48,820
good win the first game.
Lots of things could happen by the end.

170
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,770
I want to make sure I've locked in my
profit for sure. How can I do that?

171
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:56,740
Well, the key is to think
about marking to market.

172
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,230
Just as we said.

173
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,300
Okay.

174
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,140
If you're

175
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,050
okay

176
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,910
assessing your position correctly,

177
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,110
even though the world series
take seven games after,

178
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,390
if you were reporting to your investors,
you're the,

179
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,440
you are a hedge fund, you're reporting
to your investors. How you're doing.

180
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,140
You should be telling them
after the first game, you know,

181
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:20,430
at the beginning you're telling them,
look,

182
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:25,020
I'm going to make $42 I expect to make
$42 after the Yankees win the first game.

183
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,930
Looks like you're going to make 60
you know, now things are better.

184
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:32,430
You expect to make $64 on average.
But if the Yankees lost the first game,

185
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,600
you can only expect to make $9 on average.
So after the first game,

186
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:41,520
you go from thinking you're going to
make 42 to meaning even more optimistic.

187
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:45,210
Now you're gonna make 64 or
are you going to make nine?

188
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:50,470
So 60% times 64 plus 40% of mine is 42.

189
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:56,180
So if you were mark telling your investors
properly how you stood after the very

190
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:57,550
first game,

191
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:02,920
you might have to tell them you've lost
33 of the $42 that you told them before

192
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:06,070
you are going to make. So you'd
already be taking, you know,

193
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:07,090
we'll be running a risk.

194
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,190
You really only care maybe about
getting money for sure by the end.

195
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:15,880
But if you're doing proper accounting,
you should be worried all the way along,

196
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:21,090
whether you're making or losing money.
And that's the key to how to uh,

197
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:25,270
have no risk by the end. You just run
no risk at all. The in between stages.

198
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,540
So all you have to do is make a bet with
a bookie who's standing by to make $33

199
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,790
in case the Phillies win the first game
and making a one game get in exchange

200
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:41,110
for losing $22 if the Yankees win,
this is still three to two odds.

201
00:12:41,111 --> 00:12:45,580
So the book is willing to do it.
So the night before the first game you,

202
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:50,170
you've bet with the Philly fan on
the entire series, which is you know,

203
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:54,640
giving you a huge advantage but you're
willing to bet with the other bookie.

204
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,910
The other book, he, we're assuming
it's only standing by game by game.

205
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,790
You're betting 33 to 22 on the Phillies.

206
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,770
You're betting on the
team you expect to lose.

207
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,370
You're betting on that team with the
other bookie but in a smaller quantity.

208
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:11,340
So this is going to mean vet your profit
at the end of the first day after,

209
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,220
after the first game, no matter
what happens is still going to be 42

210
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,930
so you can guarantee you can
lock in 42 after every game.

211
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:25,180
And so as I said last time,
the crucial thing is so then the,

212
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,420
so then one thing I didn't
say, so one thing to, uh,

213
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,070
which I forgot to observe last time,

214
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:32,890
which I think is interesting is
so is that what you should do?

215
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,750
Should you do that after every
game? Always Bet 33 to 22, uh,

216
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:41,680
you know, against the Yankees with
the other bookie of the answer is no.

217
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,000
Okay. What should you do if
the Yankees win the first game?

218
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,450
By winning the first game,
your expectation goes up to 64.

219
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,390
Now it could be either 82 or 30,
but after,

220
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,640
so on the night after the first game,

221
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,040
you're much better off than
you were before. Of course,

222
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:03,540
you laid off part of the bet with
the bookies you've had to pay off 22.

223
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,830
So you're still only 42 ahead.

224
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,740
But the Yankees have
now won the first game.

225
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:11,650
So it's now the night after the
first game, before the second game,

226
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,030
you're subject to more risk.
What should you do now?

227
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,290
You should go back to the book and
make another bad on the second game.

228
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:25,291
But should the other bet be 22 to 33
absolutely not because 64 up here goes to

229
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:31,300
whatever that number is,
which I forgot already.

230
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,860
82 and a half to 36 and a half.

231
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,520
Okay,
so what should you do?

232
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,730
What did you do now?
So I've done some rounding here,

233
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,280
which is going to screw everything up
a little bit, but while I'm not now,

234
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:04,660
what should you do here after the
first game? You're here. Here you are.

235
00:15:04,661 --> 00:15:05,860
After the first game

236
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,950
you've made your bed, um,
with the book the first game,

237
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:16,640
you bet 33 against 22.
Now what should you do the second game?

238
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,690
What should your bet be with that bookie,

239
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,030
he's still willing to give you three to
two odds on the Yankees either direction.

240
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,320
What should you do?

241
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,450
Okay,

242
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,730
you're not going to bet 33 22 again,

243
00:15:36,731 --> 00:15:40,510
you're going to make a different
pet and what should it be? Yes,

244
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,210
exactly.
So you should do,

245
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:50,270
you should give up 18 if the
Yankees win and get 27 rounding up.

246
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,860
She conveniently rounded a little bit
because I had rounded a little bit.

247
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,720
So you should do 18 and 27.
Now notice that's still three to two odds.

248
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,481
So the book,

249
00:16:01,481 --> 00:16:06,481
he's still willing to do that for you
and you're locking in the 64 because it's

250
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:11,190
going to be 64 again. And you
know, adding this a 64 again,

251
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,180
but of course you'd already, right, so
you've locked in whatever this number is.

252
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:20,100
So the first step, you made a bet to
lock this number in. In the second step,

253
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:23,880
you made a bet to walk this number and
you're always walking in where you were

254
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:27,890
before.
So that bed is changing each time,

255
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:30,980
but you're always walking in what you
were before because after the Yankees have

256
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:34,210
won the game, now you
know, the next game is, uh,

257
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,080
not quite as important that you know,

258
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:40,100
the time is running out on the
Phillies so that it's not as, uh,

259
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,560
you know, revealing the next game
about what's going to happen. So, um,

260
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,940
you make a smaller bet up
here than you did before.

261
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,550
Okay, so that, so why is
that locking everything in?

262
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:59,570
Because this average is now 64
what was here. But don't forget,

263
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:04,100
you'd already made the initial bet to
lose 22 so you've locked in 44 now here

264
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:08,690
and also 44 here cause you still
over 22 from the first bet. Okay?

265
00:17:08,691 --> 00:17:12,350
So you just keep proceeding down the tree,
locking in where you were before.

266
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,790
And so by induction you've locked
in 42 so that's what you're doing.

267
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:20,420
And the bat is changing every time.
So what do you think the bed is here,

268
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:21,254
by the way?

269
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,690
The bed here or you could go
from nine you can go from nine to

270
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,440
36 or minus 32 so what should you do here?

271
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,350
What's your,
do you do here?

272
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,210
What's the bet that you're going to make
with the bookie after the Phillies win

273
00:17:48,211 --> 00:17:49,080
the first game?

274
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:56,370
So it's going to be minus
27 and plus 41 okay.

275
00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:02,740
And that's, you know, all three to
two odds with some rounding. Right?

276
00:18:02,741 --> 00:18:07,420
13 and a half times three is 40 and
a half. So it's still fair odds.

277
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,040
Okay.

278
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,810
So the book, he's willing to do that.
You've locked in nine. So bite induction,

279
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,200
you've always locked in where you were
before and therefore you've locked in 42

280
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:20,020
all the way along. You know, it
sounds like we're lacking in nine,

281
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,340
but we're not locking a nine.

282
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:25,630
Because remember the first day you won
$33 from the bookie when the Phillies won

283
00:18:25,631 --> 00:18:29,560
the first game. So you've locked in the
nine, but don't forget the 33 from before.

284
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:34,390
So it's really, you've locked in 42.
So 42 is locked in the whole way. Okay?

285
00:18:34,391 --> 00:18:38,080
So that's dynamic hedging.
You, you, you, uh,

286
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,550
have a complicated bat along. That
depends on a lot of things along the way,

287
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,190
but you bet each time,
along the way,

288
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,760
maybe changing her bad each time
depending on what's happened so far.

289
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,730
And that way you can lock
in whatever profit you had.

290
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:57,210
So that's the thing that sports
bookies have known for a long time.

291
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,090
You know, the expression hedging
your bets comes from that.

292
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,710
And so that same logic can
be applied to the market.

293
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,390
Okay. But remember the
crucial, okay, so the,

294
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:14,220
the step that I didn't emphasize
very much is that although you're,

295
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:16,960
you're, you know, you seem to be
locking in where you were before,

296
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,340
there was a slightly more abstract way
of saying that that at the end you're

297
00:19:21,341 --> 00:19:24,220
going to get $42 a for sure.

298
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,400
So of course you could borrow all the
way back from the beginning and get $42

299
00:19:29,441 --> 00:19:33,370
immediately and then never
owe anything in the future.

300
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:36,970
Cause whatever bet you were winning
or losing with the Philly fan you were

301
00:19:36,971 --> 00:19:41,350
making up for with your myriad
bets with the bookie. Okay.

302
00:19:41,351 --> 00:19:42,230
So it's a,

303
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:47,230
it's a replication argument that by
betting sequentially with a bookie,

304
00:19:47,231 --> 00:19:48,100
different amounts,

305
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,270
you're undoing the single long
bet you had with the Philly fan.

306
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:54,923
Okay?

307
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:55,401
Okay.

308
00:19:55,401 --> 00:20:00,401
So now let's move from sports
as we did last time too.

309
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,050
Um,
the market.

310
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,160
So here we had the prepayment
spreadsheet and so we had,

311
00:20:07,161 --> 00:20:10,790
remember this was a,
this was a bond,

312
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,020
a mortgage, the 30 year
mortgage, 8% mortgage,

313
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:19,610
and the interest rates started off
at 6% and had a 20% volatility.

314
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,360
And now your thinking of a,

315
00:20:23,361 --> 00:20:26,510
so the interest rates could follow
this process there you see it,

316
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:31,750
they started 6% but they can go up or
down by 20% basically every period.

317
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:37,010
So you assume that everybody knows this
and knows that the probabilities are 50

318
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:38,960
50.
That's like saying you know,

319
00:20:38,961 --> 00:20:43,910
in advance there's a bookie out there
that is the market that's willing to give

320
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:45,710
you no matter what day it is,

321
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,600
50 50 odds of the interest rate
going up or down from then on.

322
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,490
That's just like the book he's
standing by. Now this time though,

323
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,800
you're going to have to,
okay. So that's how that,

324
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,860
so you now are going to take advantage
of the fact that you can anticipate that

325
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:05,920
the market will stand there
ready, uh, to, to bet with you.

326
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:10,510
Now if the whole market freezes or
something, you can be totally screwed.

327
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:14,410
You're doing your complicated dynamic,
you know, betting with the market.

328
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,210
One day you wake up and you can't bend
anymore because nobody's willing to train

329
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:22,330
something horrible's happened, you know,
nine 11 happened or something like that.

330
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,080
You can be caught in a really
bad situation and ended
up running a lot of risk.

331
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,540
Okay,
so you're relying on the market.

332
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,690
So it's not surprising that
when the market freezes up,

333
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:34,840
lots of people suddenly are exposed
to more risks than they were before.

334
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,420
All right? Now let's, uh,

335
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:42,220
let's suppose that so now in the market
you're not going to be able to find

336
00:21:42,221 --> 00:21:46,450
these pure arbitrage is in the sports
example, it was a pure arbitrage.

337
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:51,310
There was a Philly fan who is betting
and even odds and a bookie who is betting

338
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:55,210
at three to two odds. Now, you
shouldn't expect that to happen. I mean,

339
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:59,570
by what miracle did this fan come to
you instead of to the other bookie?

340
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,450
You know, why do you deserve to meet
this fan and take advantage of him?

341
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,030
What have you got that
no other book he has?

342
00:22:07,031 --> 00:22:10,540
It's a miracle he came to you and not to
one of the other hundred bookies. Well,

343
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,980
it's probably because you actually know
something that the other bookies don't,

344
00:22:14,981 --> 00:22:18,160
that you can take advantage of.
So in the background here,

345
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,490
there's another thing that you knew,

346
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,460
you knew the fan was going
to pay off if he lost,

347
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,970
maybe the other bookies weren't willing
to bet with him because they didn't

348
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,580
think he was going to pay off if he lost.
Okay?

349
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:34,570
So that's the extra thing that you knew,
you knew he was going to pay off.

350
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,650
Now it makes sense that he came to you
and not to the other book is because you

351
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:41,140
actually knew something that they don't.
Okay?

352
00:22:41,141 --> 00:22:44,440
And so that's how it
really works in the market.

353
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,250
You're relying on some piece
of information you have
that they don't. Of course,

354
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:50,930
you could be wrong about that information.
Then you get into a lot of troubles.

355
00:22:50,931 --> 00:22:53,830
So here in this mortgage,
what's the thing you're relying on?

356
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:58,900
I'm assuming that there's a bookie that
the rest of the market is standing by.

357
00:22:58,901 --> 00:23:03,700
Ready? As I said to trade, make
interest rate bets with you. Okay?

358
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:07,210
With everybody at even odds.
You know, whether the market,

359
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:09,820
whether the interest
rate's gonna go up or down.

360
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,610
So no matter where you find
yourself in the future, like here,

361
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,150
someone's be willing to vet in 50
50 odds that will go up or down.

362
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,250
Now this is a year long bet.

363
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:20,170
So you're gonna have to take
into account the interest rate.

364
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:25,410
It's not just going to be 50 50 you know
you have to discount all the cash flows

365
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:26,291
by the interest rate,

366
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:30,520
but it's basically a 50 50 bet discounted
by the interest rate. So now what?

367
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,220
What's new here? Well, you don't
know what the cash flows are. Okay?

368
00:23:36,221 --> 00:23:40,620
So here's the extra piece of information
you're adding. You know that the, the,

369
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,680
the mortgage homeowner is rational
and it's going to prepay rationally.

370
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,440
So you know what these cash flows are.
You know,

371
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:51,770
some of the time the mortgage
homeowner's going to pay the $8 CEOs,

372
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,800
some of the time he's just
going to pay $8. In fact,

373
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:58,340
here is what you know is going to
happen down here where the ones are,

374
00:23:58,341 --> 00:24:01,940
he's going to pay as coupon of eight
pay off the remaining principle.

375
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,540
And that's the end of it. So,
in fact, the very first day he,

376
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,370
if interest rates went down,

377
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:11,150
the rational thing to do is to
pay off the entire mortgage. Okay.

378
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:15,230
So you know that's going to happen. Now.
That's the extra information you have.

379
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,290
You know what the cash flows are.
If other people knew those cash flows,

380
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,820
they would figure out the
price of the mortgage too.

381
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,370
It's just they don't know those,
you know,

382
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:29,380
the cash flows and you can now figure out
that the price better be 98 because if

383
00:24:29,691 --> 00:24:31,100
it's why,

384
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,420
if there's someone else willing to trade
with you to buy that mortgage for more

385
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:39,050
than 98. Okay. Like why might that happen?

386
00:24:39,051 --> 00:24:42,350
Because someone else might have the
erroneous opinion that the homeowner will

387
00:24:42,351 --> 00:24:44,090
never call.

388
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:47,750
The mortgage will never prepay cause he's
just going to be asleep all the time.

389
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:52,100
So let's say, um, let's say
it's a, the homeowners, a she,

390
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:54,680
let's say the homeowners are all,
she's this,

391
00:24:54,681 --> 00:24:58,850
this other trader thinks they're
all asleep and we'll never prepay.

392
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:03,560
You know that these homeowners are all
incredibly alert and on top of things.

393
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:08,120
And so they're going to prepay and the
value's only 98 so because of that extra

394
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:12,950
information, you know the actual
cashflows, sorry, we're here.

395
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,120
You know the cash flows,

396
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:18,230
you know how to value the bond
and you know it's worth 98 okay?

397
00:25:18,231 --> 00:25:19,340
But you can so,

398
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,780
and let's say the other guy's willing
to pay you 124 so you can sell it short

399
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,740
for a,

400
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,120
you can sell it to the Guy Short for 120
that means you owe whatever cash flows

401
00:25:29,121 --> 00:25:32,780
the mortgage pays. Okay? And you know
what it's going to pay down there.

402
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:38,140
So how can you lock in your profit will
because with $98 at the very beginning,

403
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,470
you can replicate those cash flows.

404
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:46,750
You can go out into the market
and buy those cashflows.

405
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:50,540
The very cashflows you know the mortgage
is going to make. How can you do that?

406
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:55,010
Well, because of the first step.
Remember what this says, the first step,

407
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:59,570
the price is 98 the interest
rate could go up or down.

408
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,220
If the interest rate goes up,

409
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:06,940
the payment is eight that's
the coupon plus 92 something.

410
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,670
Now you need 2.6 and if it goes down,

411
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:14,870
the payment is eight okay,
so what is this?

412
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,380
The payment is actually eight that's
the cash flow that has to be made.

413
00:26:18,381 --> 00:26:22,760
The mortgage wasn't called here at the
beginning, so no matter what she does,

414
00:26:22,761 --> 00:26:23,421
the homeowner,

415
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:26,720
she's got to pay the eight so you know
you're going to owe the guy ate the first

416
00:26:26,721 --> 00:26:30,890
period. Now down here, she's
actually going to prepay,

417
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,690
so she's actually going to pay
the guy the whole 99.1 up here.

418
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,600
She's not going to prepay.
She's going to hang on to the mortgage.

419
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:42,890
So what is this 92.6 this
is the present value,

420
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,690
assuming those cashflows
of her future payments.

421
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:50,820
So if you get $98 you know
that one half times this,

422
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:55,821
this by the way is 102.6 so one half times
this divided by 1.06 plus this thing,

423
00:26:57,751 --> 00:27:02,751
remember is one oh seven one one
divided by 1.06 times a half.

424
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,140
That's how we got the number
98 98.8 whatever it was.

425
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:13,070
That's how you calculated 98.8 by backward
induction and took this value divak

426
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:18,030
times a half discounted plus this value
times a half discounted that say you got

427
00:27:18,031 --> 00:27:23,031
98.8 so therefore if people are
willing to trade at these prices,

428
00:27:23,281 --> 00:27:24,930
in other words,
what's the price here?

429
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:30,140
It's a half times one over 1.06 and this
is a half times one of 1.06 you can buy

430
00:27:32,341 --> 00:27:37,341
a dollar here at a cost of one half
times 1.06 you can buy a dollar here at a

431
00:27:38,251 --> 00:27:43,230
cost of a half divided by 1.06
paying this amount at the beginning.

432
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,410
We'll buy you a dollar here paying
this amount at the beginning.

433
00:27:46,411 --> 00:27:49,440
We'll buy you a dollar here.
So by paying this amount,

434
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:54,770
you can get this pay off a 102.6 a 100.6
or 800.6 you can get this hundred 0.6

435
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:05,811
and you can get 107 point
11 because precisely this
is the cost that you have to

436
00:28:07,321 --> 00:28:10,890
pay for each dollar up here.
And this is the cost

437
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:16,230
that you have to pay here for each
dollar down here. Why is that?

438
00:28:16,231 --> 00:28:20,910
Because we said the market is standing
by recognizing that these are 50 50 odds

439
00:28:20,911 --> 00:28:22,050
and then it has to discount.

440
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,760
So that means the whole market is
willing to train you. Uh, you know,

441
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,750
we'll be willing to promise you a dollar
here in exchange for this amount of

442
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:31,584
dollars here.

443
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,460
It'll be willing to promise you a dollar
here and in exchange for this amount of

444
00:28:35,461 --> 00:28:37,470
dollars here.
So with this amount of dollars,

445
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:41,770
you can buy $8 and have 92.6 leftover and,

446
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:46,500
and you can also buy $8
here with 99.11 leftover.

447
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,370
So all of this together is enough to
make the prepayment cause you know she's

448
00:28:50,371 --> 00:28:52,530
going to prepay here.
That's what we found out.

449
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:54,630
She's going to prepay
it the first step down.

450
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,670
What would the headlines say?
Okay.

451
00:29:05,671 --> 00:29:08,910
She's pretty pain.
Just as we said at the very first step,

452
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,060
she's prepaying the first interest
rate down. She's going to prepay.

453
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:14,340
So we know you're going to have
to come up with all this money.

454
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,690
But you've bought it over here, it costs
you this amount and you bought all that.

455
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,950
If things went up, you'd have to pay
eight okay. Which you've also bought,

456
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:27,300
but you've got 92.6 leftover and that's
going to be enough to buy everything

457
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:30,360
that comes after that because the next
day you're going to have to buy more

458
00:29:30,361 --> 00:29:32,880
stuff.
And so you just keep buying going forward.

459
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:38,090
So with $98.80 you can buy all the future
cash flows and you sold the thing so

460
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:41,950
you can make all your payments that
you're obliged to selling it short.

461
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:46,870
And he received 120 to begin with.
So you locked in $21.20 okay.

462
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:51,280
So that's the gist of the whole
thing. So okay, I said it last time.

463
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:55,360
Not very well. I said it a little bit
better this time. Still not brilliantly.

464
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,670
But do you get now get it.

465
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,350
Someone asked me a question perhaps.

466
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,873
Is it

467
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,860
okay? So two, I'll say
the, the punchline again,

468
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:17,280
the punch line is that if
you can find a favorable,

469
00:30:17,411 --> 00:30:18,071
so here,

470
00:30:18,071 --> 00:30:22,390
what was different about the world series
and the mortgage example in the world

471
00:30:22,391 --> 00:30:22,901
series,

472
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:27,901
you took advantage of the fact that there
was a bookie and a Philly fan willing

473
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:30,850
to bet at different
odds on the same thing.

474
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,350
And so even though the Philly fan
had a very complicated, you know,

475
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:39,850
seven day bed and the Yankee,
the bookies,

476
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:42,640
the other bookies were rolling,
willing to make day by day bats,

477
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:47,620
you could take advantage of that
disparity to lock in a profit for sure.

478
00:30:47,621 --> 00:30:51,280
And that's what you should
try to do in the market.

479
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,610
Your probably relying on something else.

480
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:59,290
You're relying on the fact that you know
more about the cash flows then the rest

481
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:03,070
of the traders do.
The rest of the market does.

482
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,910
Maybe cause you understand
prepayments better than they do. Okay.

483
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:11,160
And so that's why I said it was so
important to, you know, model prepayments.

484
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:14,290
So let's say you understand prepayments
better than they do. So you know what?

485
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:17,710
The cash flows are going to be
much better than the market does.

486
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:21,520
You can take advantage of
that in front of, okay,

487
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:25,180
so you're taking advantage of you.
You need now this advantage,

488
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,890
just like in the world series,

489
00:31:26,891 --> 00:31:29,800
you might have needed the advantage of
knowing the Philly fan would actually pay

490
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:30,760
off if he lost.

491
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:34,750
So there's that advantage that you have
and now you have to rely on the fact

492
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:38,080
that the market or the bookie
from then on day by day,

493
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,140
year by year is willing
to make bets at these, uh,

494
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,120
odds that you can anticipate.

495
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,230
And so using that you can trade over and
over again with the rest of the market

496
00:31:47,231 --> 00:31:50,160
and dynamically replicate what,
uh,

497
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,740
the payments you have to make
by selling the bond short.

498
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,460
So therefore you've locked in your
profit because you can anticipate,

499
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,940
assuming the market stays, they're
willing to trade it, even odds,

500
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:06,090
you'll always be able to produce the cash
flows with the $98 you started with to

501
00:32:06,401 --> 00:32:10,060
exactly meet all your payment obligations
you've incurred by selling the

502
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:13,300
mortgage short. And since you
sold it at the beginning for 120,

503
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,630
you've made $21 at the beginning
and you'll never need those dollars.

504
00:32:16,631 --> 00:32:20,170
You just put them in your
pocket. Okay? So that's the, uh,

505
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:22,441
okay.

506
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:27,441
So that's how the dynamically hedge a
winning position to eliminate the chance

507
00:32:27,931 --> 00:32:31,440
of loss. Of course, you
still bear a chance of loss.

508
00:32:31,441 --> 00:32:35,280
If you are wrong about the prepayments,
you're going to lose money.

509
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:39,230
And if the rest of the market suddenly
stops being there to make these year by

510
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:41,780
your bets on which way
interest rates are going to go,

511
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,470
you'll also be subject to a lot of risk.
So you're relying on those two things.

512
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:49,250
The whole market not collapsing and
you're being right about prepayments.

513
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,910
But conditional on those two facts,
you've locked in your profits,

514
00:32:52,911 --> 00:32:54,500
you got rid of a bunch of risk,

515
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:59,480
the blind luck of a hundred minus a
hundred from the roll of the dice of the

516
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:01,010
Phillies.
You've got rid of that lock,

517
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:05,570
but you still had to count on the bookie
being there day after day after day and

518
00:33:05,571 --> 00:33:06,440
on the fact.
Yeah.

519
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:08,990
And in the mortgage case and the
fact that you knew how to predict the

520
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:09,824
prepayments.

521
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,213
Yes.

522
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:28,480
Okay. I never made 42 on the
first bet here at the beginning.

523
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,040
Nothing's happened yet. The series hasn't
been played yet. So I say to myself,

524
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:37,270
I've made this hundred dollar bet with
the Philly fan for the whole series and

525
00:33:37,271 --> 00:33:41,110
who's going to win the series?
That's going to happen seven days later.

526
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,140
So right now I can anticipate on average,

527
00:33:44,141 --> 00:33:48,280
I'll make $42 some of the time I'll
lose a hundred some of the time I win a

528
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,800
hundred but an average,
I'll come up $42 a head.

529
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:54,520
But so I've done a smart thing
betting with the naive Philly fan,

530
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,620
but I'm still potentially screwed.

531
00:33:56,621 --> 00:34:01,060
I could still lose $100 I'll still have
to face my investors and tell them I've

532
00:34:01,061 --> 00:34:05,440
lost all your money. They'll, you
know, they're going to close me down.

533
00:34:05,441 --> 00:34:07,120
And that's the,
so I don't want to run that risk.

534
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,550
They don't want me to run that risk
and I don't want to run the risk.

535
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:11,840
I still want to take
advantage of the Philly fan.

536
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:16,841
So what I do is every game I make
another bet against my inclination.

537
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,070
I bet not on the Phillies. I
bet. I mean not on the Yankees.

538
00:34:21,071 --> 00:34:21,904
So I think they're gonna win.

539
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:26,230
I'm betting on the Phillies cause I'm
undoing part of the gamble that I did with

540
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:30,970
this guy. I'm hedging that gamble.
But by doing that in a clever way,

541
00:34:30,971 --> 00:34:35,410
changing how much money, I bet each
game. So the night before the first game,

542
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,440
I bet $33 to $22 on the Phillies winning
after the ink is when the first game,

543
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:46,120
I bet $27 to $18 again on
the Phillies winning. Okay?

544
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:50,170
So I decrease my bet going up.
I increase it going down.

545
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:53,140
So by doing these clever
game by game bets,

546
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:55,630
I lock in $42 for sure.

547
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:57,823
Yes.

548
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:16,070
Okay. So you have locked it
in. So how could that be?

549
00:35:16,071 --> 00:35:20,330
So that's a good question. But you've
overlooked something. So her question is,

550
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,330
you know,
the game is going to end after seven days.

551
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:25,850
What if I ended with a
minus a hundred you know,

552
00:35:25,851 --> 00:35:29,630
I ended the Philly's won all four games.
It doesn't look like I've lost.

553
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,970
So why didn't I lose?

554
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,793
Okay,

555
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,010
I bet a hundred with the original

556
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,440
Philly fan,
I bet $100 on the Yankees of the Phillies.

557
00:35:40,441 --> 00:35:45,060
We in all Ford first four games,
I've got to give the guy $100 okay?

558
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:47,970
Of course I made these side bets
with all these books on the way.

559
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,590
So what were the side bets?

560
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,440
Don't meet those that are secure that
I love the rent was coming out of it.

561
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,133
There's going to be an end

562
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:07,380
situations. You're up $42 but we're
trying to understand why that is.

563
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:10,320
That's your question, right? So I'm,

564
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:13,440
you're going to be able to
answer the question. Uh,

565
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:16,530
although you don't think so yet,
but so what happened the first time?

566
00:36:16,531 --> 00:36:19,020
The first time the Phillies won.
Okay.

567
00:36:19,021 --> 00:36:21,810
That bet with the original
Philly fan is looking worse.

568
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:26,760
Now it looks like I had 44
to $42 I expected to win. No,

569
00:36:26,761 --> 00:36:31,590
I only expect to win $9 because you
know the series is turning against me.

570
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,510
But the book,

571
00:36:33,511 --> 00:36:38,130
He paid me $33 so I'm
$33 already in my pocket.

572
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,173
This is nine.

573
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:44,180
Now let's say I got to the end to the
last game where this was a zero okay,

574
00:36:44,981 --> 00:36:48,160
let's say this is the last
game where I've lost, okay,

575
00:36:48,161 --> 00:36:51,880
well this is minus 32 let's say it was
minus. Let's say this is the last game.

576
00:36:51,881 --> 00:36:55,420
I lose $32 here.
Let's say the bat,

577
00:36:55,421 --> 00:37:00,421
it was only a two game series and I lose
30 I give up $32 in case the Phillies

578
00:37:01,961 --> 00:37:03,340
win the first two games,
right?

579
00:37:03,341 --> 00:37:07,120
So you're saying I'm down
$32 that's the last node.

580
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:11,050
How can I possibly be up 42 well,
so what's the answer?

581
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,173
What?

582
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,050
Right? Because I bet on the
first game and the book,

583
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,820
the first book he gave me $33 then the
second game I'm going to bet with the

584
00:37:22,821 --> 00:37:27,320
bookie and I'm going to
be minus 27 and 41 okay,

585
00:37:27,321 --> 00:37:31,610
so although I now all the Philly Fan,
$33 here,

586
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:36,970
I made $41 with the second bookie
and $33 with the first bookie,

587
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:42,150
that's $74 and I paid 32
to the original Philly fan.

588
00:37:42,151 --> 00:37:46,340
So I'm still up $42 okay. Now,

589
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:48,920
just so it sounds like you
have to do a lot of arithmetic.

590
00:37:48,921 --> 00:37:52,850
You don't have to do any arithmetic.
I knew I was going to end up $42 up.

591
00:37:52,851 --> 00:37:57,440
How is that? Because every bed, I
said, let's look at the number here.

592
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,440
Wherever we are in the tree,
like here at this node,

593
00:38:00,441 --> 00:38:02,510
after all the stuff
that's happened before,

594
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,580
the bet I'm going to make with the bookie,

595
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:09,670
that one game is going to be enough to
turn this random thing and to 64 64 okay.

596
00:38:11,181 --> 00:38:15,800
So I always take what happens further
down the tree and turn it in to what's

597
00:38:15,801 --> 00:38:17,270
happened at the beginning of the tree.

598
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:22,490
But then I work at all the way back
and it's 42 okay. So that means,

599
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:27,730
see this thing was 64 nine but I made a
bad 22 to 33 but the bookie to turn it

600
00:38:28,311 --> 00:38:33,311
into 42 42 this thing was 64 I made
a bet to turn this into 64 64 okay.

601
00:38:35,261 --> 00:38:40,060
But with the 22 here, that's also 42
so no matter how far I go on the tree,

602
00:38:40,061 --> 00:38:44,920
I'm still exactly 42 ahead.
Okay. Any other questions?

603
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:45,754
Yes.

604
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,613
Okay.

605
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,680
Sorry. What am I doing? We're, we're

606
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,790
okay. So her question is,
in this case, the mortgage.

607
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:18,780
So now we're moving from the world
series to more real life. In this case,

608
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:23,840
I know the cashflows from this mortgage
or worth 98.8 but somebody else not

609
00:39:24,451 --> 00:39:27,390
understanding the homeowner
and how rational she is,

610
00:39:27,391 --> 00:39:30,780
someone else is willing to
pay me 120 for that mortgage.

611
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:35,990
So I sell the mortgage for 120 and
I take $21 and put it in my pocket.

612
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:41,580
Okay, now I've got $98.80
left. So that's money.

613
00:39:41,581 --> 00:39:45,030
Now I have to do something
active with what do I have to do?

614
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:48,840
I owe this guy a lot of payments.
Every time she,

615
00:39:48,841 --> 00:39:51,540
lets say it's you makes your payment,
her payment,

616
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:56,070
you know in the market I've sold
the thing short. That means I owe,

617
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:58,710
I've promised to deliver
whatever that mortgage delivers.

618
00:39:58,711 --> 00:40:02,790
That's what it means to sell it short. So
I've got to deliver the eight here. Say,

619
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:06,870
okay so how am I, I've got to live with
eight here and here. She's prepaying,

620
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:10,320
I have to deliver the whole hundred seven
all right,

621
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:15,470
so with $98.80 I can afford to buy a
$100.60 in this state and a 107.11 in this

622
00:40:19,531 --> 00:40:22,860
state. How do I know that? Because
that's where the 98.8 came from.

623
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:27,120
It said this total amount
of 100.6 times the price,

624
00:40:27,121 --> 00:40:29,520
which is the odds of it happening,
discounted.

625
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:34,640
That's the price plus the
hundred 7.11 times it's priced.

626
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,510
The odds that happens.
Discounted.

627
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:41,810
Okay is exactly 98.8 that's where I got
98.8 so therefore with $98.80 remember

628
00:40:42,751 --> 00:40:43,131
the book,

629
00:40:43,131 --> 00:40:47,760
he's willing to go either way with $98.80
I can buy all these cash flows and all

630
00:40:47,761 --> 00:40:48,750
these cash flows.

631
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:53,990
So what do I do with the hundred
0.6 so with the 107.1 down here,

632
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:59,340
I pay the eight her coupon
and her 99.11 prepayment.

633
00:40:59,341 --> 00:41:03,270
I pay it all to that guy sold the bond
short too. And I've kept my promise.

634
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,560
That's the end of the mortgage appear.
The mortgage only delivered eight.

635
00:41:07,561 --> 00:41:10,320
So I only owe him eight.
Okay.

636
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:15,330
But I've got another 92.6 left.
Why is that exactly what I need?

637
00:41:15,331 --> 00:41:16,350
Because from here on,

638
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:20,370
I have to use that money to buy the
future cashflows cause she's going to

639
00:41:20,371 --> 00:41:24,780
continue to pay her eight
and maybe eventually we will
prepay. But by induction,

640
00:41:24,781 --> 00:41:27,090
by repeating the step over and over again,

641
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:32,130
I can always make the payment and have
the present value leftover to afford to

642
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:35,870
buy the future payments plus
the present value leftover.

643
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,660
So by induction I'm
always making the coop.

644
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:41,390
Like in this first step I
make the coupon payment,

645
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:45,410
plus I've got enough money leftover
to match the present value.

646
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,870
So that means as I go
forward and Ford and Ford,

647
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:52,020
I keep making the payment and matching
the present value that's leftover.

648
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,550
By the time I get to the 30th year,
I've made the coupon payment,

649
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:59,420
the present value leftover zero cause
there isn't gonna be any payments after

650
00:41:59,421 --> 00:42:01,280
that.
So I've made all the payments.

651
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,370
Yeah.

652
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,260
Yes I could.
Okay.

653
00:42:07,261 --> 00:42:11,640
So I was hoping you wouldn't
ask me that because it's um,

654
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,500
so what happens in the next period?

655
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:20,380
So here we know that she didn't pay,
she didn't prepay.

656
00:42:20,381 --> 00:42:25,381
This was 90 to the present value is 92.6
so we're here 92.6 now she didn't pray.

657
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:32,290
Let's look at what she's doing,
whether she's prepaying or not. Okay?

658
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:34,240
So this is why I did the second graph.

659
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:38,740
So if the interest rates go up
the first time and then back down,

660
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:42,370
she's still not going to prepay.
Okay?

661
00:42:42,371 --> 00:42:45,160
So we can now go up and see,
oops,

662
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,423
let's see.

663
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,250
Okay, here we are. So we can go up
now and see what's happening here.

664
00:42:56,251 --> 00:42:59,940
It's 92.65 go up to 83.95

665
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:07,560
or down to um,

666
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,550
97.2

667
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:17,930
I need 7.17. Okay, so what does that
mean? That means what the, okay,

668
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:22,670
so with $98.80 she bought a,
he I bought,

669
00:43:22,671 --> 00:43:26,570
I'm the guy selling the thing short.
You're the smart, rational prepare.

670
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,910
So you paid $8 here.

671
00:43:28,911 --> 00:43:31,220
That means because I've sold the
mortgage short and you've paid,

672
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:32,750
you've made that $8 payment.

673
00:43:32,751 --> 00:43:36,410
I owe the guy the $8 payment
just as if he had the mortgage.

674
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:40,070
So I've got to come up with the $8
down here. Things had moved here,

675
00:43:40,071 --> 00:43:42,830
you would have paid $8
plus the whole prepayments.

676
00:43:42,831 --> 00:43:47,831
You would have paid $107 but with 98.8
I can buy eight plus 92.6 up here.

677
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,510
April's 99.11 down here.

678
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,810
So I bought all the cashflows
I need to down here.

679
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:56,180
I hand them over to the guy and they say,
you see,

680
00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:00,680
I kept my promise to deliver whatever
that mortgage did and I knew that she was

681
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:04,070
going to prepay. I knew how smart
she was and so I've kept my promise.

682
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:08,270
You didn't think she'd prepay. I knew
what. I've kept my promise. Okay,

683
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:13,220
and then up here I've got the $8
so I can make the payment match it.

684
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:18,140
I've got 92.6 left now I don't give it
to the guy because the payment's only

685
00:44:18,141 --> 00:44:18,710
been eight.

686
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:23,710
I take the 92.6 and with the 92.6 that
happens to equal this plus eight times a

687
00:44:26,601 --> 00:44:31,601
half divided by 1.06 and then equals
also this plus eight times a half divided

688
00:44:33,241 --> 00:44:37,350
by 1.06, uh, not by 1.6
by the interest rate here,

689
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,280
which happens to be, you have to figure
out what that interest rate was up there.

690
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:42,583
Um

691
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,513
mm.

692
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,960
So the interest rate went up to it started
at 6% and went up to old seven three

693
00:44:51,861 --> 00:44:55,450
2%.
So this is 0.0732

694
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:01,550
how did this number 92.6 get calculated?
It was exactly.

695
00:45:01,551 --> 00:45:04,880
Take the payment of Eight,
take the present value of what's left,

696
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:10,030
multiply by half and discounted at the
interest rate here plus a half times,

697
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:11,323
uh,

698
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:16,250
this payment of eight plus the
remaining plus the value of what's left

699
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:18,140
discounted by that.
It's interest rate.

700
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:22,370
So this is number 92.6 allows
me to buy this and to buy that.

701
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:26,270
So therefore if things went up again,
okay,

702
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:31,360
I could make her eight your $8 payment
that you make to the bank I have to make

703
00:45:31,401 --> 00:45:34,610
to the other guy because I sold the Morgan
Short, I've got the money to pay him.

704
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,490
I've also got the money to pay
him if things had gone down again,

705
00:45:37,491 --> 00:45:40,910
$8 and I've got more cash in my pocket,

706
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,550
this and this and the two
cases with this money,

707
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:47,270
I can continue to buy the future
payments that you're going to make.

708
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:51,470
So I always have enough money to make
whatever payments it is that you,

709
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,960
that I have to to keep my promise.

710
00:45:56,310 --> 00:46:00,800
Yup. Correct. From your point of view,

711
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:07,010
go up because your theory
about prepayments isn't
going to be put to the test.

712
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,083
Um,

713
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:14,220
well don't forget I'm locking
in my $21 profit for sure.

714
00:46:14,221 --> 00:46:15,450
So no matter what happens,

715
00:46:15,451 --> 00:46:18,330
I'm going to just be able to make
all the payments no matter what.

716
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:24,150
But that assumes that you're hearing
about prepayments, correct? Yes.

717
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,370
So yes. Right. Not just
put it on one risk.

718
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,790
Right.
So it's sort of,

719
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:36,870
okay. So go ahead. So let me
repeat his question and feel free,

720
00:46:36,871 --> 00:46:41,520
give me in slightly different words.
He's saying that I was able to take it.

721
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:43,080
This is what my hedge fund does.

722
00:46:43,081 --> 00:46:47,190
Literally we think we know better what
the prepayments are going to be then the

723
00:46:47,191 --> 00:46:50,430
rest of the market.
So we're willing to take on a commitment.

724
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:54,660
Someone will pay us $120 we think
we're only going to have to, you know,

725
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,360
$98 or enough to buy all the,

726
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:02,370
all the promises that we've made by
selling the thing short say now how do we,

727
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:07,020
we could be wrong.
We have been wrong last two years.

728
00:47:07,021 --> 00:47:09,780
We made a lot of mistakes. So, um,

729
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:14,430
your saying the question is okay.
Uh,

730
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:19,490
the reason why the guy is willing to pay
so much is because down here he thinks

731
00:47:19,681 --> 00:47:23,070
he's going to get a lot of
money. The interest rates
are going down. So you know,

732
00:47:23,071 --> 00:47:26,700
discounting at a lower rate, the
mortgage is going to be worth a lot more.

733
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:29,220
We don't think it's going to be
worth more because we're expecting,

734
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,060
okay up here it's sort of obvious that
there aren't going to be any prepayments.

735
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,090
So if the world really goes
interest rates going up,

736
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:40,990
then our theory of prepayments
never gets put to the test.

737
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,310
And so we just make money in this
guy, you know? And so I mean,

738
00:47:44,311 --> 00:47:47,830
so our theory never gets put to the test.
If interest rates go down,

739
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:51,290
then our theory has been really put to
the test and we have to see whether she's

740
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:56,050
really smart enough to prepay or not.
So you're right, that's absolutely true.

741
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,190
Yup.
But in any case,

742
00:47:57,191 --> 00:48:00,910
we're going to assume our theory is
correct and hedge in such a way so that if

743
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:02,560
our theory is correct about prepayments,

744
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:06,880
we will exactly be in a position to
keep our promises without ever running a

745
00:48:06,881 --> 00:48:08,830
risk of loss.
Yes.

746
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,273
Yup.

747
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:17,770
There are two situations where the
Phillies win four games or they win the

748
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:18,604
series.

749
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:24,720
Either way you $100 and
you win a single game vets.

750
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:29,540
But in one of those situations
and one single game,

751
00:48:29,541 --> 00:48:33,460
that one in five games rather than

752
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:38,560
okay.

753
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:43,560
Because it couldn't have happened that
there were four straight wins and then a

754
00:48:43,891 --> 00:48:48,510
lost the series would have
been over. Right. So therefore,

755
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,880
uh,
you're,

756
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:55,110
so his question is I've asserted
that no matter what the way,

757
00:48:56,230 --> 00:49:00,580
what way things go, I'm going to
end up $42 a head no matter what.

758
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:04,210
And he's saying that's great,
but he's a little skeptical.

759
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:07,930
It could be true because I'm always
betting against this other bookie.

760
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:13,090
I'm always betting on the Phillies with
the other bookie. And so in one case,

761
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,380
uh, the Yankees win four in a row, I just,

762
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:21,130
I lose for bats with the other bookie.

763
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,360
In the other case with the bookie,
I'm betting on the Philly. So I've,

764
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:28,030
I've had to take for losing bets with
the other bookie in the case where the

765
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:30,550
Yankees win three lose one.
And then when in the end,

766
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:34,030
I've again lost four bets
with the other bookie.

767
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:35,860
But I've actually won a
bet with the other bookie.

768
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,710
So it seems like somehow
things are better for me.

769
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:43,330
And so it seems unbelievable that
I'm still at 42 in both cases.

770
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:47,380
That's your question. Right.
Okay. So the puzzle, the,

771
00:49:47,381 --> 00:49:50,560
the reason is that,
um,

772
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:57,280
my bets are changing.
So after I don't make the same last bed.

773
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:01,630
Okay. So the first three bats, there's
a Yankee, Wayne Yankee. When Yankee,

774
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:05,350
when each of those nights, I'm making
the same bet in the same scenario,

775
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,920
but when the Phillies lose
and then win again, I changed.

776
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:13,840
I've changed my bet.
So I'm still going to end up with a,

777
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,360
I'm still going to end up. So
the, so the Yankees lost the, uh,

778
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:24,220
your scenario was the Yankees
lost the fourth game. Okay.

779
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:29,310
So that outcome is different from what
it would have been in the first scenario

780
00:50:30,651 --> 00:50:32,930
because the Yankees
lost instead of winning.

781
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:37,760
So the bookie bat went the other
way now. Okay. So that was a,

782
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:42,820
but now the f the last bet I made is not
the same bet as I would have made the

783
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:43,430
night before.
It's a tour.

784
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:47,360
It's a different bet so that it just ends
up with the different direction in the

785
00:50:47,361 --> 00:50:49,400
fourth bet.
Plus this different fifth bet.

786
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,000
It adds back up to what
would have happened had the
Yankees won the fourth time.

787
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,140
I don't know if that helps. But
that's what happens. And, and the,

788
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:02,060
and the proof that it happens is just by
induction. So really your, your, you know,

789
00:51:02,061 --> 00:51:06,710
I gave a proof and your saying the
proof is just, it's amazingly good.

790
00:51:06,711 --> 00:51:09,680
Remember the proof is very simple.
You always make a bet. So let,

791
00:51:09,681 --> 00:51:10,910
no matter what happens,

792
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:15,410
you're expectation is back to where it
was the night before. And if you do that,

793
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,430
you have to end up,

794
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:20,480
that's the proof that you've always
locked in 42 from the beginning. And so,

795
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:20,721
you know,

796
00:51:20,721 --> 00:51:23,660
you can ask a thousand questions like
that and it's always going to be a

797
00:51:23,661 --> 00:51:26,330
complicated answer. But there has
to be an answer cause we proved it.

798
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,253
There was one.

799
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,740
Okay.

800
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:32,080
Okay. Any other questions about this? Yes,

801
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:34,603
Morgan.

802
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:41,050
So with the mortgage example, your
hedging against the interest rate going,

803
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:45,100
uh, no. When the interest rate goes up,

804
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:49,270
you actually pay less, right?
That's that. You've made a promise.

805
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:53,380
Remember the price as the interest rate
goes up. Where's the mortgage? Sorry?

806
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,230
The value of the non call,
the value of the call.

807
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:05,150
So is the interest rate goes up,
you owe less money,

808
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:08,810
right? Cause you're promising to deliver
this stuff. So we interest rates up.

809
00:52:08,811 --> 00:52:11,420
The mortgage you've sold short
is less and less valuable.

810
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:15,830
So that's the good scenario for you.
But if the interest rate goes down,

811
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:20,540
that's the scenario where you could
get into trouble. So you're hedging,

812
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:23,690
you're trying to protect against
the interest rate going down.

813
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:27,620
In order to do that, you
have to give money up in case
the interest rate goes up.

814
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:36,580
Okay. So now I want to, I want to,
uh, any other questions about this?

815
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,690
It's quite an ingenious thing.

816
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:43,940
I think this is the high, so we're
going to have one more step of this,

817
00:52:43,941 --> 00:52:47,480
but this is the high watermark of
the standard. Uh, you know, the,

818
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:52,250
the finance guys who made finance
such an important subject and,

819
00:52:52,251 --> 00:52:56,090
um, you know, the rational
expectations, school of finance,

820
00:52:56,091 --> 00:52:58,190
this is kind of the most
clever thing that they did.

821
00:52:58,191 --> 00:53:02,270
So this was this kind of
reasoning, you know, uh, bookies,

822
00:53:02,271 --> 00:53:03,650
maybe new ad for a long time,

823
00:53:03,651 --> 00:53:08,651
but black shoals in 1973 started this
kind of thinking and then lots of hedge

824
00:53:09,381 --> 00:53:12,750
funds started imitating it,
including my own. So, so I,

825
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:16,550
I certainly didn't invent this
idea of dynamic hedging. Now

826
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:20,000
let's take a step back.

827
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,270
The crucial idea is marking to market.

828
00:53:23,271 --> 00:53:27,510
The crucial idea is that you want to
hedge through millions of scenarios and

829
00:53:27,511 --> 00:53:29,700
really the outcome,
you won't know until the end.

830
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:32,160
What you should do is hedge at each,

831
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:37,050
at each step of the way your
mark to market value. Okay?

832
00:53:37,051 --> 00:53:39,520
So you only have to do things
a step at a time. So, you know,

833
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:42,510
there's an exponentially
growing number of paths,

834
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:45,840
but there are only two possibilities
from today til tomorrow.

835
00:53:45,841 --> 00:53:47,190
So it's very simple to hedge.

836
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:52,191
Two things seems incredibly complicated
to as hedge to to the hundred things you

837
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:56,160
know, to the 10th is a very big
number. Two was a very small number.

838
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:59,490
You can hedge to things that may be
very complicated to hedge two to the 10

839
00:53:59,491 --> 00:54:03,360
things, but you only have to hedge
to things on every day. Okay?

840
00:54:03,361 --> 00:54:06,600
So once you've realized that hedging
is actually quite a simple operation,

841
00:54:06,601 --> 00:54:11,280
you don't have to do it by trading in
the interest rate derivatives market.

842
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:14,550
You could trade in a simpler market.
Suppose for example,

843
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:16,680
that you knew that uh,

844
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,330
there were bonds being traded,
you know,

845
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:24,990
let's say 30 year bonds. So let's just
take a look at a 30 year bond here.

846
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:25,913
Um,

847
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,180
cold barn.
So this is exactly the same thing.

848
00:54:37,181 --> 00:54:41,590
This is the 30 year bond under the
same circumstances. It's a 9% bond,

849
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,580
9% bond, okay? Coupon bond,

850
00:54:45,581 --> 00:54:48,340
and it starting with the
same 6% interest rates.

851
00:54:48,341 --> 00:54:50,530
Exactly the same process as before.

852
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:52,670
Okay?

853
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:56,840
Okay. So the interest rates, those are
the same. Interest rates is before. Okay?

854
00:54:56,841 --> 00:54:58,910
So here's the bond.
Now the bond,

855
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,640
okay,

856
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,840
the bond,
it starts at $140.

857
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:06,550
You can go to $121 at $159.
Hey,

858
00:55:06,551 --> 00:55:11,551
remember this thing that you're trying
to hedge goes from 98.8 to a hundred 0.6

859
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:19,720
or 207.11 okay?

860
00:55:19,721 --> 00:55:24,470
So what you need to do now is you're,

861
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:29,350
you've promised to make
deliveries in the future,

862
00:55:29,351 --> 00:55:32,860
you know, very complicated, but you know,
you can summarize that whole future.

863
00:55:32,861 --> 00:55:37,861
As long as you've got a hundred $0.60
in the upstate and $107.11 in the

864
00:55:37,931 --> 00:55:39,880
downstate,
after the very first step,

865
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:44,260
you will have hedged your
mortgage obligation. But you know,

866
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:48,430
you could just buy the right percentage
of bonds and be able to accomplish the

867
00:55:48,431 --> 00:55:52,630
same thing. So why is that? Well,
there's a gap here in here. You know,

868
00:55:52,631 --> 00:55:56,140
you owe less money here
than you do down there.

869
00:55:56,230 --> 00:56:00,250
So the bond is worth less
appear than down here. In fact,

870
00:56:00,251 --> 00:56:03,430
this bond is worth $38
more here than here.

871
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:09,070
So the gap and the bond
is 38. The gap in the, uh,

872
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,800
in here is something like a

873
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:15,500
6.5.

874
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:17,250
Okay?

875
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,110
Okay,
so this is like one sixth.

876
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,610
So as long as you held
one sixth of the bond.

877
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,050
Okay.

878
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,370
One sixth of the bond.

879
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:28,810
Yeah.

880
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:32,140
And something that paid
the right constant amount.

881
00:56:32,141 --> 00:56:35,860
In each case you would get the
same payments here in here.

882
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:38,920
So what is the right constant? Mt.
One sixth of the bond. By the way,

883
00:56:38,921 --> 00:56:43,921
it would cost you 20 a
to 24 23 about $23 okay.

884
00:56:46,961 --> 00:56:47,970
One Sixth of the bonds.

885
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:51,760
So if you took the other $98.80 and
put it to the one year treasury,

886
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:54,640
I claim it's obvious. So
take one, sixth of the,

887
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:59,260
so one sixth of 30 year,

888
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:04,270
9% bond. Okay, that's one
sixth of this thing. Okay.

889
00:57:04,271 --> 00:57:09,100
Plus. Okay. Which costs
you cost you what it costs?

890
00:57:09,101 --> 00:57:14,101
$23 price of that is $23 now combine
that with a $75.80 of one year treasury.

891
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,840
6% one year or 6% treasury.

892
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,233
Yeah.

893
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:30,591
Okay.

894
00:57:30,591 --> 00:57:35,591
So hold those two things I claimed that'll
pay you a hundred 0.6 year and 107.11

895
00:57:36,801 --> 00:57:41,600
here. How do I know that without having
to even calculate anything out? Well,

896
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:44,360
the Treasury is going to pay
the same amount here in here.

897
00:57:44,361 --> 00:57:46,730
It's going to be a constant.
This thing,

898
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:50,300
since it's gap is $38 and
I only hold a sixth of it.

899
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:55,400
It's going to pay me exactly six and a
half more down here than a pace here.

900
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:58,220
Cause the gap instead of
38 will be a sixth of that,

901
00:57:58,370 --> 00:58:01,460
which will be six and a half.
So the gap will exactly match that.

902
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:04,010
So added that to the treasuries,
constant payments.

903
00:58:04,011 --> 00:58:07,850
I'm going to get something over here and
six and a half dollars more than that

904
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:12,260
down here, but since I've
paid the same amount, 98.8,

905
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:16,280
it's going to have to be that
that constant was exactly
right to make this be a

906
00:58:16,281 --> 00:58:21,281
hundred 0.6 and 107.11 because both the
one year treasury and the 30 year bond

907
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:26,750
were calculated by discounting whatever
their payments were here in here by the

908
00:58:26,751 --> 00:58:31,040
same prices, this and this.
Okay. So there's a second way.

909
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:35,300
Instead of trading in the, in the, in
the treasure, in the derivatives market,

910
00:58:35,301 --> 00:58:37,880
I could just hold the,
uh,

911
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:42,520
a combination of two bonds though
one year treasury and the, um,

912
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:46,340
30 year, 9% bond, and I'd
still be perfectly hedged.

913
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:49,160
But then when I got to hear,
I'd want to change my mix.

914
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,090
I'd want to hold a different one
year bond, different interest rates.

915
00:58:53,091 --> 00:58:54,410
So a different,
I have to buy a new one.

916
00:58:54,411 --> 00:58:59,300
Your bond in a different amount
of the 30 year, a callable bond,

917
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:02,930
9% bond. But I could always
reproduce these same two payments.

918
00:59:02,931 --> 00:59:07,570
So I don't have to hedge by holding
derivatives, interest rate to Rodeos.

919
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:11,120
I can hedge my holding standard bonds.
Okay.

920
00:59:11,121 --> 00:59:16,121
And I can tell at a glance how much of
the longer term bond to hold because I

921
00:59:16,341 --> 00:59:21,341
just have to match this gap and the prices
since the one year is always going to

922
00:59:21,831 --> 00:59:23,150
pay the same thing up and down.

923
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:25,040
Okay.

924
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,370
Okay.
Did that go too fast?

925
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:36,300
Yeah. Like this, this, but, but how
you, you figure out how to put one,

926
00:59:36,301 --> 00:59:37,134
you're bothered by it.

927
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:39,710
Okay.
So I want to find,

928
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:43,610
I want to hold one sixth
of the 30 year bond,

929
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:49,030
which costs me 140 so one sixth of
that is going to cost me $23 okay?

930
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:52,100
So I know,
alright,

931
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:56,960
now I want to also hold a one
year treasury so that the payment,

932
00:59:57,110 --> 01:00:02,110
one sixth of one 21 at the top plus
whatever the one year treasury pays me is

933
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:07,700
equal to 100.6 and such.

934
01:00:07,701 --> 01:00:12,140
That one sixth time's this
value at the bottom. Oh, sorry,

935
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,900
it's one sixth.
This coupon is paying,

936
01:00:14,901 --> 01:00:18,920
actually it wasn't 121.6 it's not 9% bond.

937
01:00:18,921 --> 01:00:23,540
I forgot it's coupon. Very bad of me.
It won't change the numbers, but uh,

938
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:26,300
so it's, it's paying.
I didn't write it down.

939
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,530
So this thing is not paying 121
it's also paying the coupon.

940
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:32,330
This is the present value of what's left.
So I was paying nine plus that.

941
01:00:32,331 --> 01:00:37,331
So it's 130 and here it's
168 the gap is still 38 okay.

942
01:00:37,521 --> 01:00:42,521
So I want one sixth of a hundred
a 130 so one sixth of 130 costs.

943
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:51,160
Um,
2020

944
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:54,280
it's still the same number is 22
did bad arithmetic to begin with.

945
01:00:54,281 --> 01:00:58,510
So it's still 22 no, sorry, one
sixth. It's one sixth of this thing,

946
01:00:58,511 --> 01:01:02,410
which is 140 so it's 23 right?
Sorry, I didn't change. Okay,

947
01:01:02,411 --> 01:01:07,390
so the payment here is 130 and
the payment, here's 168 so I want,

948
01:01:07,391 --> 01:01:12,391
so one sixth of 130 that's the UPPP
payment and this is one sixth of 168 okay.

949
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:20,730
Now I want that plus whatever the one
year treasury gives me to equal a hundred

950
01:01:21,251 --> 01:01:24,550
0.6 up here and 107.11 down here.

951
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:28,300
That way I would have replicated things
and hedged myself perfectly. Right.

952
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,420
But I don't have to figure out
what that one year treasury is.

953
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:32,500
I think it's obvious.

954
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:37,680
All I have to do is say subtract 23 from
98.8 so I just have to buy $75.80 worth

955
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,340
of the one year treasury. And that'll
give me exactly the right payoff.

956
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:46,990
Why is that?

957
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:52,320
Because this number 140.93

958
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:54,533
okay.

959
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:01,520
Divided by six is exactly this evaluated
this price one half over 1.06 times

960
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:09,090
this. This is the price one
half times one over 1.06

961
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,500
right.
So that bond,

962
01:02:13,501 --> 01:02:17,820
which costs 140.53 how
did I get 140.53 there?

963
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:20,790
I took the of a dollar and the upstate,

964
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:24,590
which is it's 50% likely discounted
multiplying by its payoff.

965
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:29,600
One 30 plus a half discounted multiplied
by the payoff of one 68 this is one 68

966
01:02:30,571 --> 01:02:31,980
cause it's a 9% bond.

967
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:36,450
So it's one six times one six
so if I get a sixth of the bond,

968
01:02:36,451 --> 01:02:41,451
it will cost me one 40.43
divided by six which is 23 okay.

969
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:46,980
So what about the one year treasury
that's going to give me some payment,

970
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,650
you know,
an additional payment here in here,

971
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:53,430
namely 1.06 times whatever I put in.
Okay,

972
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:55,240
so but you see the,

973
01:02:55,770 --> 01:03:00,030
so that payment,
okay,

974
01:03:00,031 --> 01:03:02,160
so you noticed that the
gap between here and here,

975
01:03:02,161 --> 01:03:06,090
since I've multiplied by one six is
exactly the six and a half dollar gap.

976
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:11,220
So if I spend, the total I have
to spend is 98.8 over here.

977
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:13,840
Okay?

978
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:17,690
So if I spend $23 on the treasury
and the remaining amount,

979
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:22,600
$23 on a 30 year, 9% bond,
the remaining amount of money,

980
01:03:22,601 --> 01:03:25,090
which is 75.8 on the treasury,

981
01:03:25,091 --> 01:03:29,830
I will spend this $98.80 but then
I have to get the same payoffs.

982
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:33,080
Why is that? Because they're all
being priced at the same prices.

983
01:03:33,081 --> 01:03:35,470
So it's just the distributor
of law of Arithmetic.

984
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:38,530
If these payoffs times the sixth okay.

985
01:03:38,531 --> 01:03:43,531
Plus the treasury payoffs equal a hundred
0.6 and 107.11 then it must be that

986
01:03:44,581 --> 01:03:46,570
the,
some of the money I spent on the,

987
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:51,460
on the 30 year 9% bond plus the son of
the money I spent on the treasury has to

988
01:03:51,461 --> 01:03:55,870
equal mind the 8.8 therefore I know that
the amount of money I spent on 98 on

989
01:03:55,871 --> 01:03:57,160
the amount of money,

990
01:03:57,161 --> 01:04:02,161
the 98.8 I spend on the one year Treasury
was 98.8 minus the 23 I spent on the

991
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:06,280
um,
the night on the 30 year bond.

992
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:08,190
Okay.

993
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:12,450
Okay. So that's how you can,
uh, okay, so to say it again,

994
01:04:12,451 --> 01:04:15,870
just in a big picture,
look there are two things that can happen.

995
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:19,140
If you hold to bonds a one year
treasury in a 30 year thing,

996
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:22,770
you're obviously going to be able to match
these two things by holding the right

997
01:04:22,771 --> 01:04:24,600
proportion on them.
Okay.

998
01:04:24,601 --> 01:04:29,601
That is just obvious and then less obvious
is how quickly I'm figuring out how

999
01:04:30,271 --> 01:04:32,040
much of those two bonds to hold.

1000
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:36,120
And the way I'm figuring it out so quickly
is because the one year treasury is

1001
01:04:36,121 --> 01:04:37,860
paying the same thing up and down.

1002
01:04:37,861 --> 01:04:40,710
So I have to get all the
variation out of the 30 year bond.

1003
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:41,900
So I have to hold the right,

1004
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,930
right proportion of the 30 year
bond to get the same variation.

1005
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:49,140
Okay.
So in the very big picture,

1006
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:53,130
if you're trying to hedge some instrument
with another instrument you want to,

1007
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:56,250
uh, and something, you
know, a portfolio stuff,

1008
01:04:56,490 --> 01:05:00,330
much of which is is certain and
only one thing that's risky,

1009
01:05:00,331 --> 01:05:04,320
the amount of the risky thing you have
to hold has to produce as much variation

1010
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:05,820
as the thing you're trying to hedge.

1011
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:11,060
So the key is being able to tell at a
glance how much variation each thing has.

1012
01:05:11,551 --> 01:05:15,180
Then he can tell them what
proportion of the whole bum. Okay.

1013
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:18,280
And so the very last thing I want
to tell you today, which is good,

1014
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:19,780
unfortunately it take me a few minutes,

1015
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:25,140
is how traders look at variation
and can guess it incredibly quickly.

1016
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,360
So a trader could look at this and yes,

1017
01:05:28,361 --> 01:05:32,710
without doing almost any calculations
what the rate hedges. So just like we did,

1018
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:34,000
did the doubling rule.

1019
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:38,770
I want to do the variation rule of thumb.

1020
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:42,260
Okay.
And so this is uh,

1021
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,050
okay.
And this is called,

1022
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:52,160
this is called duration and
convexity or average life.

1023
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:57,140
So I asked myself,
suppose I have this 30 year bond,

1024
01:05:58,970 --> 01:06:02,880
30 year non callable bond.
That's this one. Okay.

1025
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:05,600
9% bond.
How could,

1026
01:06:05,601 --> 01:06:10,601
I guess kind of what the variation in
price would be without having to do,

1027
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,720
you know, I've had to do this
very complicated backward
induction calculation.

1028
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:20,270
Now remember once the interest rates
go up here, it's a random walk.

1029
01:06:20,271 --> 01:06:23,660
So on average they're
pretty much not pretty much,

1030
01:06:23,661 --> 01:06:26,360
they're exactly what they were here,
you know, they're, they start here,

1031
01:06:26,361 --> 01:06:27,141
they go up and down.

1032
01:06:27,141 --> 01:06:30,980
But on average they're still here and
over here they've gone down. Okay.

1033
01:06:30,981 --> 01:06:34,250
So the average is lower going forward.
In fact, it's exactly equal to that.

1034
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:38,510
So if you're a trader and
there was no uncertainty,

1035
01:06:38,511 --> 01:06:42,170
you would know that the present value
with no uncertainty is going to be the

1036
01:06:42,171 --> 01:06:47,171
coupon divided by one plus the interest
rate plus the coupon over one plus the

1037
01:06:48,141 --> 01:06:49,340
interest rate squared.

1038
01:06:50,330 --> 01:06:55,330
Plus in the last year the coupon over one
plus the interest rate to the t plus a

1039
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:01,460
hundred times one plus the interest rate
the tea. That's the value of the bond.

1040
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:02,571
Okay.

1041
01:07:02,571 --> 01:07:07,070
Now you're sort of want to know how much
is that price going to change when the

1042
01:07:07,071 --> 01:07:11,900
interest rate changes? Well, at a glance,

1043
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:17,060
I mean you just take the derivative.
What is DPV Dr.

1044
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:21,170
Okay.
It's going to be um,

1045
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:26,380
minus C over one plus r squared
minus two c over one plus r cubed

1046
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:32,840
minus,
um,

1047
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:38,660
t time see over one
plus r to the t plus one

1048
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:45,340
minus t times a hundred divided by
one plus r to the t plus one as the

1049
01:07:45,981 --> 01:07:48,590
derivative.
Okay,

1050
01:07:48,591 --> 01:07:53,060
so all I would say I'm making things even
more complicated you would think. But

1051
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:54,823
yeah,

1052
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,870
this turns out to be not so complicated.
Okay.

1053
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:04,190
Because this is a number.
So let's put the minus on the outside.

1054
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:05,600
It's all get rid of this.

1055
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:13,190
This is a number which you
can sort of get in your head.

1056
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:17,060
So let's try writing.
Let's pull out one of the one plus R's.

1057
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:19,340
So it's minus one over one plus r times.

1058
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:24,790
See Over one plus r plus two s
two CE over one plus r squared,

1059
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:33,780
k plus t times c plus a hundred that's
the last payment over one plus r to the

1060
01:08:35,271 --> 01:08:36,104
t.

1061
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:39,823
Now

1062
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,140
what is that? Can you interpret
that? And the answer is yes,

1063
01:08:45,141 --> 01:08:48,620
you can interpret that because
what is that? That's saying?

1064
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:53,540
These are all the payments you're getting
over the life of the bond paid cc and

1065
01:08:53,541 --> 01:08:54,920
the last one,
c plus a hundred.

1066
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:59,870
This number that keeps coming in front
of them though is the year in which

1067
01:08:59,871 --> 01:09:03,020
you're getting the payment. This is in
the first year. I could put a one there.

1068
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:05,570
This is the payment and the
second year there was a two here.

1069
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:08,270
This is a payment and the teeth here,
there's a t here.

1070
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:12,650
You got that t from taking the
derivative of the denominator here. Okay.

1071
01:09:12,651 --> 01:09:17,651
So it's like waiting the year in
which the payments come by the press,

1072
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,280
the value of those payments.

1073
01:09:22,281 --> 01:09:26,420
So in the first year the value is see
the present value of c of one plus r and

1074
01:09:26,421 --> 01:09:30,150
the second year the payment is see
the value, you know, but discounted.

1075
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:32,870
See Over one plus r
squared in the last year.

1076
01:09:32,871 --> 01:09:36,290
The total payment of c plus a hundred
but you have to discount it by one plus r

1077
01:09:36,291 --> 01:09:37,124
to the teeth.

1078
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:42,280
So this is just like taking the average
year in which the present value flows

1079
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,570
actually come.

1080
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:49,780
If I divided this now by the
present value of the present value,

1081
01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:52,460
this number,

1082
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:58,270
these numbers down here see over this
plus c over the squared plus one c plus a

1083
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,690
hundred over this to the teeth.

1084
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,410
Those are all weights multiplying
the year in which the payments come,

1085
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:05,120
they add up to the present value.

1086
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:10,360
So basically I've just got a weighted
average of what year the payments come in.

1087
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:13,040
This is called the average life

1088
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:22,040
is this thing in here is the average life
because I multiplied the year in which

1089
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:26,630
the payments come by, the present value
of the cash flows there. And I'm going,

1090
01:10:26,631 --> 01:10:31,340
I've made bows multipliers add
up to one by dividing the up Pv.

1091
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,250
So yeah, this is the, this in parenthesis,

1092
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:39,280
all these terms are the things multiplying
the year in which the thing came.

1093
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:44,000
So if I add up all these coefficients
here, I'm just getting the present value.

1094
01:10:44,001 --> 01:10:45,590
So now the coefficients add up to one.

1095
01:10:45,591 --> 01:10:49,880
So I'm just taking an average of the
year in which the thing cane and that's

1096
01:10:49,881 --> 01:10:51,890
what the average life is.
But that's equal to the,

1097
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:56,390
to the derivative of the present
value divided by the present value.

1098
01:10:57,590 --> 01:11:01,460
Okay, so what's the percentage change in
the present value is the average year in

1099
01:11:01,461 --> 01:11:03,920
which the payments come.
So let's just think about it.

1100
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:08,090
Suppose you have a 10 year
bond, it pays C, c, c, c, c,

1101
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:12,860
and then a hundred at the very end. What
do you think the average life is? Well,

1102
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:14,370
if there were no discounting,

1103
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:18,330
the average life wouldn't be five because
it was such a huge payment. In the end.

1104
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:22,770
The average life would be,
you know, eight or nine. Okay.

1105
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:24,490
But there is this county,

1106
01:11:24,491 --> 01:11:27,360
so this thing at the end won't count as
much and the average life is probably

1107
01:11:27,361 --> 01:11:31,350
seven if it's a 30 year bond fee,
average life,

1108
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,740
you know you're going to get CCC and then
all the way at the end you're going to

1109
01:11:34,741 --> 01:11:38,670
get c plus a hundred well, if the payments
were all equal and no discounting,

1110
01:11:38,671 --> 01:11:42,120
it would be 15 but there's a
huge amount of discounting.

1111
01:11:42,121 --> 01:11:45,120
So that last payment is
really pretty irrelevant.

1112
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,880
So probably so it's not
clear which way it goes.

1113
01:11:47,881 --> 01:11:52,350
Probably the average life
will be less than 15 okay.

1114
01:11:52,351 --> 01:11:56,250
So, so you can see just
by looking at the bond,

1115
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:59,550
I'm ending with this thought
by looking at the bond itself,

1116
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:03,510
you can figure out what
the average life is. Okay.

1117
01:12:03,511 --> 01:12:07,680
So I've trader just by a little experience
and common sense can figure out the

1118
01:12:07,681 --> 01:12:11,160
average life I'm here, all the payments,
the way they're coming, they're coming,

1119
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:14,910
you know, evenly across the whole history,
the bond with something at the end.

1120
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:17,610
So the average life is probably
a little bit over the average,

1121
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:19,440
but if you go way off,

1122
01:12:19,441 --> 01:12:23,220
you pushed the final payment too far to
the end that it's becoming negligible,

1123
01:12:23,221 --> 01:12:24,270
it's almost irrelevant.

1124
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:27,810
And so the average life by discounting
probably be before the average.

1125
01:12:27,811 --> 01:12:30,900
So a 10 year bond probably
has an average life of seven.

1126
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:35,490
A 30 year bond maybe has an average life
of 12 or 13 once you know the average

1127
01:12:35,491 --> 01:12:36,830
life,
you just have to,

1128
01:12:36,831 --> 01:12:40,650
to hold bonds in proportion
to their average life.

1129
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:44,970
The dollar amount you put in each bond
to hedge it is just proportional to its

1130
01:12:44,971 --> 01:12:49,230
average life. So that's how a trader,
without having to do any arithmetic,

1131
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:54,440
can kind of guess how much of the 30
year bond will it take to hedge a 10 year

1132
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:56,090
bond.
And how much of uh,

1133
01:12:56,240 --> 01:13:00,960
so which has the so which has a higher
average life. The longer the bond,

1134
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:05,350
the higher the average life, the
more sensitive it is to, uh, uh,

1135
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:09,300
to interest rate changes. So the less
of it you need to hedge your position.

1136
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:12,420
So if you hold the 30 year bond,
you don't have to hold that much of it,

1137
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:16,140
a sixth of it. In order to hedge this
mortgage, the mortgage has a very short,

1138
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:18,840
average life because it's
prepaying so quickly,

1139
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:20,490
so it's not going to last very long.

1140
01:13:20,491 --> 01:13:25,230
So it's this amazing connection between
average life and sensitivity to interest

1141
01:13:25,231 --> 01:13:27,270
rate.
Average life is something you can guess.

1142
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:30,810
Sensitivity to interest rate is something
you have to do huge calculations for.

1143
01:13:30,811 --> 01:13:33,990
But the two are almost the same.
Okay. So on the problem set,

1144
01:13:33,991 --> 01:13:35,730
we'll see if you can do it.
Um,

1145
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:40,680
I ask you a couple of problems
to do with the average life.
