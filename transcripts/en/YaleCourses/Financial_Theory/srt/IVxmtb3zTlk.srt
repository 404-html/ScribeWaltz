1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,200
I think I'm going to start.
Um,

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,190
so this is really the beginning
of the finance part of the course.

3
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:10,770
So far we've reviewed general equilibrium,

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,210
which I said Fisher invented or
reinvented in order to do finance.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,260
And as you remember, the, the, the,

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:22,270
the main conclusions from general
equilibrium are first that uh,

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,870
the market functioning by itself
without interference from the outside.

8
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:30,681
In other words,

9
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:35,030
the situation of Laissez faire leads
to allocations that are parade Oh,

10
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:35,850
efficient.

11
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,030
So they're in some sense good for
the economy and good for the society.

12
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:41,400
They don't maximize total welfare.

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,430
That's not even a well defined
thing as we saw last time.

14
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:48,000
Because how can you measure, how can
you add one person's utility to another?

15
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:49,170
It doesn't even make sense.

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,540
So economists at first were wrong to
think of that as the criterion for good

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,620
allocations.

18
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,670
But there's another better
definition of efficiency.

19
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,010
That parade oh invented
called Credo efficiency.

20
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:06,180
And the free market achieves pray to
efficiency at least if there are no

21
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:08,490
externalities and there's no monopoly.

22
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,590
So that lesson number one was taken
to mean that the government shouldn't,

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,540
shouldn't interfere in the free market,

24
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,850
especially shouldn't interfere
in financial markets.

25
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:19,620
And that's something we're
going to come to examine.

26
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:24,621
The second lesson we found was that the
price is determined by marginal utility.

27
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,750
So if you, it's not determined
by total utility. So, uh,

28
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:34,350
it may be that water is much more valuable
than diamonds because it does a lot

29
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:37,410
more good for everybody and for the
world as a whole than diamonds do.

30
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:41,850
But the last drop of water, really, most
people have as much water as they need.

31
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,160
The last drop of water's
not doing that much,

32
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,670
whereas the last diamond is a rare
thing and not many people have them.

33
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,760
So the last drop of water is worth less
than the last equal weight of diamonds.

34
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:55,320
And therefore water's much
cheaper than diamonds,

35
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:58,590
even though waters much more
valuable as a whole than diamonds.

36
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:03,330
The price of things depend on
their marginal utility. Uh,

37
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,920
so you, you, uh,

38
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:11,370
a third implication of what we did is
that there's no such thing as the just

39
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,530
price. It depends on what people's
utilities are and how much they like it.

40
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:18,360
It depends on how much
of the good there is.

41
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:22,830
That's why diamonds are priced less
than water. And it depends on who,

42
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,270
how wealthy people are.

43
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,360
If you chance for money from people who
don't like apples compared to tomatoes

44
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,480
to people who like apples
a lot compared to tomatoes,

45
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,380
the price and the free market is going
to reflect more of the latter class of

46
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:39,840
people than the former because
they've got the money to spend.

47
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,620
And so the price of apples is going to
go up relative to the price of tomatoes.

48
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,820
So those are the three basic lessons
of general equilibrium, which we,

49
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,440
the first one about laissez faire
has a huge implication for what we,

50
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:57,240
whether there should be regulation, but
the second pair of implications, uh,

51
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:57,511
you know,

52
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:01,690
what determines the price
and price changes as you
redistribute wealth and so on.

53
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:02,560
And no just price.

54
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:06,340
That set of ideas you'll see is also
going to be very important for finance.

55
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,180
So those lessons seem clear.

56
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:13,540
Some of those lessons were understood
already by Aristotle, as we said,

57
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,640
till the ancients understood
supply and demand,

58
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:17,320
at least a little bit
of supply and demand.

59
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:22,480
And yet as soon as they moved from
apples and oranges to finance,

60
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,440
they all got hopelessly confused.
So Aristotle said,

61
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,810
interest is unnatural.

62
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,680
I could go through a lot of people
in what they said, but I'm gonna,

63
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,500
I'm gonna just leave it at a few,
a few quotations.

64
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,980
The Bible says interest
is terrible. Judaism, um,

65
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,250
frowns on interest.
Christianity frowns on his interest.

66
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,110
Islam frowns on interest.

67
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,130
All the great religions of the world
crystallizing obviously some of the most

68
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:54,130
important thing.
You have the time frowns on interest.

69
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,350
So just to remind you
of a few. Um, so what,

70
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:03,430
what, what, why do they frown on interest?
Well, the idea is that, you know,

71
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:04,540
you do nothing.

72
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,110
The lender does nothing and he gets
Mac more than he lent to begin with.

73
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,100
He's making a profit without having
exerted any effort whatsoever. So,

74
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:17,560
so a named Middleton said, in trade,
both parties are expected to gain,

75
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:21,430
whereas in lending it usury
only the user could profit.

76
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,050
So, um, you know, in
Deuteronomy, in the Bible,

77
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,010
so this is the Jewish Bible. It
says, thou shalt not land unusually.

78
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:33,250
That just means interest. That'll show
up much lend on usury to thy brother,

79
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,710
usually of money,
usually evict duals,

80
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,910
usually of anything that has lent
upon usury. That's all terrible.

81
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,280
Of course, unto a foreigner, thou mayest
lend upon usury. But unto a brother,

82
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,280
thou shalt not lend upon usury.
Okay?

83
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:51,430
So the Jews could lend to Christians,
but not to each other.

84
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,410
So the Christian Church outlawed usury,
called it a mortal sin.

85
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:01,630
Luther, for example, says for who? So
Lens that he wants it back better or more.

86
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:06,820
That is open and damnable Aaker, those
who do that are all daylight, robbers,

87
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:11,560
thieves, and occurs. Those are
little Jewish arts and tricks.

88
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,960
So, um, there was this
antipathy towards usury.

89
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,290
And because Jewish money lenders were
able to lend to Christians, and there,

90
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,890
there was a,
an antipathy to Jewish money lenders,

91
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:25,990
which are going to come to
when we talk about Shakespeare.

92
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,880
So Muslims also forbid, uh,
lending. In fact, even today,

93
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:33,760
it's illegal to charge
interest in Islamic law.

94
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,330
So in my hedge fund we
tried to raise money. Uh,

95
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,420
I mean there's lots of money in the
Middle East so we try and, and most of it,

96
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:40,931
by the way,

97
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:44,830
10 years ago was invent almost all
Middle Eastern money was invested in US

98
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:49,450
government bonds in us stocks, nothing
else, like in mortgages for instance.

99
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,111
So we,

100
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:54,790
I went to a Saudi Arabia and I meant
a bunch of brothers of the king,

101
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,440
you know,
the Elvis brothers of kings.

102
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:02,300
And I suggest that they invest in our
hedge fund and they actually became sort

103
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:06,350
of interested. And so we had to write up
a complicated contract. I mean, you know,

104
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:07,640
a mortgage pays interest.

105
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:11,360
So if you invest in the hedge in the
hedge fund and the mortgages paying

106
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:14,990
interest, it looks like they're getting
interest. And so that wasn't going to do.

107
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,600
So we had to write a
very elaborate contract,

108
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,750
which disguise the fact that interest
was being paid and it had to be overseen

109
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,360
and a blessed according to Sharia law,

110
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:30,530
by a holy person who was going to
verify that there was no interest.

111
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,700
Now he charged a fee,
which was a percent a year,

112
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,340
which looked an awful lot
like interest. But anyway, so,

113
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,560
so the point is all these religions have
banished interest despite the fact that

114
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:48,140
they themselves were involved in
interest in lending and borrowing.

115
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,670
And so all of it, you know, you just,

116
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:54,170
the world can't function really without
lending and borrowing and the charging

117
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:57,430
of interest.
But so I don't mean to so,

118
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,340
so these religions that for baited at
the same time knew that it was going on

119
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,760
and uh, allowed it to go on and
sometimes participate in it.

120
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,150
But the point I'm trying to make
is that there was vast confusion.

121
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:12,890
And even today there's confusion because
still today the Jewish law doesn't

122
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,930
allow for interest between Jews and it's,

123
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,310
there's this charade that goes on there
just like there is and in Islamic law

124
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,170
and just like there is a still
frowned upon by the Christian Church.

125
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,460
So, um, it's a hard subject to
understand. And why is that?

126
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:31,250
Why is it that it's so confusing
and how should we understand it?

127
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:36,530
Well Fisher cut through all
of this extremely simply.

128
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,720
And the way he did it was to,
he said,

129
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,340
let's just think mathematically then
we won't get so tied up in all these

130
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,750
religious complexities. Just let's do
something mathematical and concrete.

131
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,930
So suppose that we consider a problem,

132
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,590
which is the one I'm going to
work with the rest of the class.

133
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:58,610
Maybe it'd better be over here.
So let's say that there are two agents,

134
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,990
um, uh, and to goods.

135
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,810
So the two goods now or x one and x two.

136
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:10,660
So Fisher's first insight is that let's
think of x one and x two is apples,

137
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,360
but apples today and Apple's next year,
Fisher said,

138
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,550
although they're both
apples exactly alike,

139
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,920
there's no difference
between these apples.

140
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,490
The apples this year are different
goods from the apples next year.

141
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,350
So let's move away from
apples and tomatoes to apples
this year and Apple's next

142
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,290
year. So not going to call
them goods x and y anymore.

143
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,740
I'm going to subscript them by time.
So x,

144
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,610
these are both ex cause it's
the same. Good. But they're,

145
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,320
they're different goods because they
occur at different time periods.

146
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:44,270
So Fisher said we can incorporate time,
uh, simply by having different goods.

147
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,710
So of course people he said are
going to have some utility, uh,

148
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:51,530
of consuming today versus
consuming tomorrow.

149
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:56,710
And let's say this utility is
log x one plus half log x two.

150
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,940
Okay. For Mr a. So I'm going
to come back to this, uh,

151
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,840
in half an hour [inaudible] point and
explain why Fisher thought that this half

152
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:11,070
made sense. You see this agent
a thinks a lot more likes,

153
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,500
good one,
a lot more than good too.

154
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,780
So official would say that's because agent
a is impatient and apple is an apple.

155
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:20,970
But if you get it now,
it's worth more to you.

156
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:24,000
It gives you a higher utility
than getting an apple next year.

157
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,280
This is a law of human nature.
He claimed,

158
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:30,260
which I'm going to come back to later
and it, and uh, that's why people, uh,

159
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,780
when you write down the utility function,
there's a discount factor,

160
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,350
which we're going to
add a discount factor,

161
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,150
which discounts reduces the utility
you get from future consumption.

162
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,570
So let's say you B of x one

163
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,350
and x two is equal to a log x

164
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,130
plus log x too.

165
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,420
So B is more patient then a is B
actually doesn't discount the future.

166
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:03,210
A does discount the future.
So a is impatient,

167
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,640
relatively impatient and be as patient.

168
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:15,420
Okay, so then let's make it,
they haven't Dauman so e a,

169
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,550
let's say the endowment
is one zero and um,

170
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,620
say it's one,
one and an e B.

171
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,910
Let's make that a one zero.
Okay.

172
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,560
But now Fisher wants to talk about finance
and he wants to talk about stocks and

173
00:10:32,561 --> 00:10:36,970
bonds and interest and all kinds of
things. So he says, okay, you know,

174
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,770
we've talked about goods with no problem.

175
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,530
We can talk about goods today
and next year with no problem.

176
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,910
Let's talk about stocks. What is a
stock? Let's say there two stocks. Okay.

177
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,170
Stock Alpha and Stock Beta.

178
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,240
So Fisher says,
I mean w w what are stocks?

179
00:10:53,241 --> 00:10:55,580
I mean there are pieces of
paper that you're trading,

180
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,630
but they give you ownership of
something like a factory or a company or

181
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:01,940
something. And what's good,
what good is the company? Well,

182
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:04,190
the good of the companies that
it's going to produce something.

183
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,720
So let's say that the stock is going
to produce something in the future.

184
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:13,460
So we'll call the production of the stock.
So what is it?

185
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,590
What is the future? It's
just X. There's only one.

186
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,140
They're only apples in the future.
So let's say d

187
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,050
two is one and d Beta two

188
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,433
equals two.

189
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,300
Okay. So Fisher says, uh, you know,

190
00:11:29,301 --> 00:11:32,920
you can tell a lot of stories about
what the stock does and what, you know,

191
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,420
what it's method of
production is and you know,

192
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:39,290
what kind of managers that has and a
lot of stuff like that. But in the end,

193
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,190
people care about the stock because the
stock is going to produce something and

194
00:11:43,191 --> 00:11:45,860
the value of the stock is going
to come from what it produces.

195
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,520
So d Alpha two is what people expect
the output of the stock to be next year,

196
00:11:52,431 --> 00:11:55,540
which is the last year we're
worrying about and debated to,

197
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,450
which is two is what people expect
the stock to produce next year.

198
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:03,100
And we're going to assume that,
uh, perfect foresight here.

199
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,320
So Fisher says, well, you know, in general
people's expectations might be wrong,

200
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,010
but let's start off with the case.
When people anticipate something,

201
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,840
surely they're looking
ahead to the future.

202
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,370
When deciding whether to buy the stock,

203
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,680
we've got to assume something
about what they think.

204
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,710
Let's suppose they actually get it right
and they know what the price of the

205
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:25,450
stock is next period. Okay. So what's
going to, uh, what's going to happen?

206
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,053
Um,

207
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:34,110
well we can define an economy and
presumably the interest rate and the stock

208
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:38,110
prices and all of that are going to come
out. Now I should mention, by the way,

209
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:41,990
I forgot to say this, uh, but as I
write this down, I suddenly realize,

210
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:43,390
I forgot to mention it.
You know,

211
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:48,391
there are other theories of interest to
another famous one was Marx's theory of

212
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:53,470
interest. So, uh, this is to be
contrasted with Fisher marks.

213
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:57,700
What did Marx say? So in my
youth, when I was your age,

214
00:12:57,701 --> 00:13:02,030
it was very fashionable to be a
Marxist. Um, so every, all of you know,

215
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,400
you could almost, anyway,
you had to study Marxism.

216
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,880
Basically if you wanted to talk to women,
you had to know about marks. So anyhow,

217
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,820
I dutifully went off and red marks.
And so what's the idea of marks?

218
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,670
The idea was that uh,
he imagined a,

219
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:24,760
an agricultural economy where you plant
stuff today and then the output comes

220
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:29,110
out tomorrow. He put corn in, in,
in today. Corn comes out tomorrow.

221
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,940
So it doesn't require much effort to plant
the corn. It requires a lot of effort.

222
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:37,600
You have to buy the corn. So the
capitalists would, would buy the corn,

223
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:41,200
but planning it didn't require much
effort. However, harvesting it, you know,

224
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:45,220
picking the cotton, you know,
picking the chocolate, um, you know,

225
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:47,230
picking all that stuff
takes a lot of effort.

226
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:52,120
So in the end you'd get a lot of output.
Now when you pick the output,

227
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:55,090
you'd have to pay workers in order to,
to pick the output.

228
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:00,300
So Mark's imagine that there was a wage
that was arrived at by the struggle

229
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,090
between,
uh,

230
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:08,320
struggle class struggle between the
capitalist and the workers over the

231
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:09,640
subsistence wage.

232
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:15,090
So the subsistence wage was something
that resulted subsistence wage resulted

233
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,470
from this huge class struggle and um,
you know,

234
00:14:20,471 --> 00:14:23,680
over time maybe it would rise as,
as workers got stronger,

235
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:27,790
but it was still always quite low and
the subsistence wage was what the workers

236
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:32,170
would get and what's leftover,
which was the surplus. Okay.

237
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:35,860
What was the output being more than what
was put in was the surplus part of the

238
00:14:35,861 --> 00:14:39,550
surplus would go to the subsistence wage,
the rest would go to profit.

239
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,410
And so if you look in how
much was put in to begin with,

240
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,750
you get all the output back out,

241
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:49,000
the same amount of corn
you put in plus some extra,

242
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:52,480
you have to give it to the workers
and extra you give to uh, the, the,

243
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,130
the capitalist gets back at his,
at his profit.

244
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,390
The fact that the capitalist has done no
work at all. He's just bought the corn,

245
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:02,660
let someone else plant it, let someone
else harvested, paid all those guys,

246
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:04,850
virtually nothing at the
beginning and a lot at the end,

247
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,850
he's gotten profit for doing nothing,
just like when you lend money.

248
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,140
And so this profit,

249
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,220
so the profit divided
by the initial outlay,

250
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,550
that's,
that was the rate of interest.

251
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,790
And so, uh, Mark's Ed that a capitalist,

252
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:26,120
he could put his money in his bank or
he could run this farm and make profit

253
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:26,750
this way.

254
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,260
So the money interest in the bank would
have to turn out to be the same as this

255
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:33,240
rate of profit. Otherwise he put all the
money in the bank. And if it was smaller,

256
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:33,921
he wouldn't,
you know,

257
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:37,580
the banks would have to give higher
interest in order to attract depositors.

258
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:42,410
So the capitalist profit rate of interest
was determined by the rate of profit

259
00:15:42,411 --> 00:15:45,620
and the rate of profit was determined by
the struggle between capital and labor.

260
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,610
Okay. So we've got these religious
figures and great philosopher saying,

261
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:53,360
interest is terrible. We've got this
great philosopher, economist thing.

262
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:55,640
It's the result of a class struggle.

263
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,090
And now we've got Fischer actually
marks was pretty mathematical.

264
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:02,840
But now we've got Fisher turning it
into a simple math problem and saying,

265
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,590
let's reason out the math problem and
we'll have the answer to these questions

266
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,170
and it'll turn out to be quite different
for one. All of these guys are saying,

267
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,380
so his, so here's his economy
that I just described,

268
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:18,230
the Fisher example,
not literally an example he gave,

269
00:16:18,231 --> 00:16:22,640
but similar to one he gave. So he said,
all right, what happens in this economy?

270
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:24,470
Let's just be very common sensical.

271
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,910
What we need to find out now is,

272
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,660
is financial like Librium.

273
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:40,880
So financial equilibrium is much more
complicated seeming than we had before

274
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:45,230
because we care about the prices. So
on, I'm going to use Q for prices.

275
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,460
So these are going to be
Iq for contemporary prices.

276
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,650
Queue contemporary. So the price you
pay today to get the apple today,

277
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,710
Q two is the price you pay
next year to get the apple.

278
00:16:57,711 --> 00:17:01,670
Next year they're contemporary
prices. Okay. And then, but we,

279
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,510
we've got a more I and of course people
are going to decide what they want to do.

280
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,400
X a one what they're going
to end up consuming x eight,

281
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:11,900
two x B one x v two,

282
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,620
but now we've got a
more complicated world,

283
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,700
their stocks to be traded.
So,

284
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:23,840
and there's the price of stocks.
So p Pi Alpha,

285
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:26,510
I'm running out of letters.
I'm going to switch to a Greek one.

286
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,460
This is the price of stock.
Yay.

287
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,500
Stock Alpha

288
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,090
and Pi Beta is the price of stock Beta.

289
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,343
Okay.

290
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,740
And then we have to know what,
what are people going to,

291
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:46,090
how many shares are they going to
hold? Well, it's going to be Feta, uh,

292
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,760
a is going to hold certain
number of shares, Alpha and

293
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,960
a is going to hold a certain number of
shares of stock Beta and B's going to

294
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:59,010
hold a certain number of shares of Alpha
and a certain number of shares of Beta.

295
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,380
So we want to solve for all of that.

296
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:06,040
Now I should have said at the beginning
if these are trees producing apples,

297
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,780
there was an initial stock

298
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,360
of,
of uh,

299
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,540
people owned a certain number of trees,
let's say Theta Alpha a.

300
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:16,180
So this is the original ownership,

301
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,900
regional ownership

302
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,290
of Alpha. Okay, let's just say
that. I'll make up some number of,

303
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:29,590
might as well use the same number I
thought of before. Let's say that right?

304
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,630
And let's say Feta Be Alpha is zero.

305
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:41,170
And let's say Feta bar a Aveda is a half
and fade up Barbie of Beta is a half.

306
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,030
Okay, so what we've begun, so this is,

307
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:53,380
so the original economy
is more complicated than
before because we've added

308
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,230
stocks, we characterize
the stock, we said okay,

309
00:18:56,231 --> 00:18:59,200
your stock is a very complicated thing.
Accompanies very complicated,

310
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:02,890
depends on managers and processes.
And you know,

311
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,620
there's all kinds of stuff you think
about when you think about a stock.

312
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,420
But really at heart,

313
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,990
all people are trying to do is forecast
what are they going to produce.

314
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:14,080
And so we're going to make it
simple mathematically and say,

315
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,360
let's say we know what they're
going to produce next period.

316
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,430
And then people be getting,
so let's say it's a tree,

317
00:19:18,431 --> 00:19:20,740
everybody knows the Alpha
trees producing one apple,

318
00:19:20,741 --> 00:19:23,200
the Beta trees producing two,
two apples.

319
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,440
Alpha happens to own the only
alpha tree and Beta and a and B.

320
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,930
A owns the Alpha tree,
excuse me,

321
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,770
and a and B own half
each of the Beta tree.

322
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,181
Okay,

323
00:19:37,181 --> 00:19:40,900
so that's the original economy and the
equilibrium is going to be how are they

324
00:19:40,901 --> 00:19:44,470
going to, what are the prices going
to turn out to be of x one and x two,

325
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,260
what are the prices of the
tree's going to turn out to be?

326
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,520
How much will people consume
and how money shares. I mean,

327
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,610
because Alpha a began
with all of the tree.

328
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,600
Maybe he'll sell his shares of tree and
ended up with not having a tree in the

329
00:19:58,601 --> 00:20:00,490
end.
So we have to see where they began,

330
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:03,010
the stock ownership to begin
with and where they end up.

331
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,730
So that's what we have to solve.
All of that.

332
00:20:04,731 --> 00:20:09,250
And it looks way more complicated than
before and so complicated that you can

333
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:12,430
see why people might have gotten confused,
but agreeing to Fisher,

334
00:20:12,431 --> 00:20:16,240
it's going to turn out to be a very simple
problem in the end once we look at it

335
00:20:16,241 --> 00:20:17,074
the right way.

336
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,490
So are there any questions about what
the economy is and what are the variables

337
00:20:21,491 --> 00:20:23,230
that we're trying to explain?

338
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,730
Yeah, I can't remember.
That says over a Beta Alpha

339
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:37,290
original ownership of stock Alpha and
this is original ownership by B of Stock

340
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:38,411
Alpha.

341
00:20:38,411 --> 00:20:43,000
This is original ownership by a of stock
Beta and this is the original ownership

342
00:20:43,001 --> 00:20:46,750
by B of stock Beta original
ownership of Alpha.

343
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,790
Thanks. Yep. Yes. Let me get
my note. These contributing

344
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,200
d is the dividend. That's the output
that we can all, okay, thank you.

345
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:01,180
I should just write this down.
This is

346
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,250
the anticipated dividend,

347
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,650
which is the output since isn't,
that's the end of the world of stock Alpha

348
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,560
in period two

349
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,170
and

350
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:27,170
Bake d Beta of two is the anticipated
dividend of stock Beta in period two.

351
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:28,890
So it's one apple.

352
00:21:28,891 --> 00:21:32,940
We're getting out of the Alpha treat two
apples out of the Beta tree and we're

353
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,450
right. That's what the trees good for.
We could look at how beautiful it is.

354
00:21:36,451 --> 00:21:40,440
We could, we could talk about how much
the owners actually watering the tree.

355
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,960
We can talk about a lot of
complicated stuff, but in the end,

356
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:45,540
all we care about is how many
apples we expect to get out of it.

357
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,830
All the eyes of stuff goes into helping
us think about how many apples we're

358
00:21:49,831 --> 00:21:52,740
going to get out of it and the end.
So we cut to the bottom line.

359
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,080
What are the apples we expect
to get out of the tree?

360
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,570
One from the apple tree
to from the Beta tree.

361
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,280
There was someone else had their hand up.

362
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,080
Okay.

363
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,110
Any other questions about the setup?
Okay,

364
00:22:07,111 --> 00:22:12,090
so we're returning to first
principles here. Very simple
example. You know, the, uh,

365
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,240
when there's ever a big confusion
about something important,

366
00:22:15,241 --> 00:22:17,370
it's always good to go
to first principles.

367
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:20,430
There was a chess player when
I was young. They, Mikhail Tal,

368
00:22:20,431 --> 00:22:25,080
who is a world champion for a little
while and he said that every two or three

369
00:22:25,081 --> 00:22:28,320
years he'd go back and read his original,
you know,

370
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,500
introductory textbooks on chess.
Um,

371
00:22:31,501 --> 00:22:33,570
so we're going back to
the first principles.

372
00:22:33,571 --> 00:22:38,250
How would you define equilibrium here
for a financial equilibrium? Well,

373
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,850
the first thing, you know,
it's just common sense.

374
00:22:41,851 --> 00:22:46,530
What are people doing at time one?
They're going to, what can they do?

375
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,430
They can spend money. So let's say,
so I'm going to look at the budget set

376
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,860
for agent I,
you know,

377
00:22:57,861 --> 00:23:01,820
and I can be a or B, so I don't
have to write it twice. Okay.

378
00:23:01,821 --> 00:23:06,410
So he's going to say to himself,
let's say a, is he and be as she,

379
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:10,870
he's gonna say, okay, I is he,
he's going to say to himself, uh,

380
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,090
let's say I can, um, I will say,

381
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,390
how much does it cost me to buy goods?
Well,

382
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,020
the cost of apples is Q1 times.
Excellent.

383
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,150
That's how many apples
I might end up with.

384
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,580
Now how much does it
cost me to buy shares?

385
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,760
It's going to be Pi Alpha Times.

386
00:23:28,761 --> 00:23:33,160
How many shares I ended up
with Theta Alpha plus Pi Beta

387
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,550
trying to stay debater.

388
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,360
Hey,
so I'm buying goods,

389
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:43,500
I'm buying Alpha shares and I'm buying
Beta shares and this is how much I have

390
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:46,580
to spend to get the
holdings I want of each.

391
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,130
Now where did I get the money to do that?

392
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:53,990
I got the money to do that because I
started with my endowment, you know,

393
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:54,860
of goods,

394
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:00,220
which was e one which in this case for
a was one unit for B was also one unit.

395
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:06,410
And then I also had shares to
begin with of these stocks.

396
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:10,640
So I had feta bar,
Alpha plus Pi,

397
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,440
Beta Theta Barbido that's,
that's in period one.

398
00:24:15,441 --> 00:24:16,370
That's what I had to do.

399
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:21,490
I wanted to buy apples shares and I
had shares to sell an apples to sell.

400
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,010
So that's uh,
that's what I did.

401
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:30,100
So of course if x one is bigger than
the number of apples I started with,

402
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:35,120
that means I has bought apples cause he
ends up with more than he started with.

403
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:36,860
So on net he must've been buying apples.

404
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,530
If Theta Alpha is more than of Alpha,

405
00:24:40,531 --> 00:24:43,100
alphabet means that Alpha
bought shares of stock.

406
00:24:43,101 --> 00:24:46,370
Alpha Theta Alpha is less
than fate of our alpha.

407
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,360
It means Alpha sold shares of stock Alpha.

408
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,400
Okay,

409
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,020
all right.
Now in the second period,

410
00:24:55,021 --> 00:25:00,021
what happens when the second period
we have Q two times x two now nobody,

411
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,570
the shares are going to be worthless in
period two so no one's going to buy them.

412
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:11,010
Why are the sheriff's worthless? Remember
that when you buy a share of stock you,

413
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:14,100
the dividend comes later.
You don't get the dividend immediately.

414
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,750
So someone buying stock in period two
it's too late to get the dividends.

415
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:22,380
It's already gone to the owner who
bought the shares and period one.

416
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:27,450
So the, the buyer of a stock
gets the dividend, you know,

417
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,800
for a month or something.

418
00:25:28,801 --> 00:25:33,060
So next period's dividend is still
going to go to the buyer in period one.

419
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,450
That's why it's valuable to buy shares
in period one cause you get next year's

420
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:40,770
apple. Okay? So by next
period you can buy the tree,

421
00:25:40,771 --> 00:25:43,380
but the world's coming to an end.
The tree's not going to do any good.

422
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:46,830
It doesn't produce any more apples.
So nobody's going to bother buying shares.

423
00:25:46,831 --> 00:25:50,190
I don't have to bother with
them. The prices or zero. Okay.

424
00:25:50,191 --> 00:25:55,080
And so what income do people
have in period two? Well,

425
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,460
name got the contemporaneous price times,
you know,

426
00:25:59,461 --> 00:26:04,020
the apples that somehow they find on
the ground that they're, you know,

427
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:07,290
or that their parents are going
to leave them when they get old.

428
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,650
So that's their endowment of apples.
But what else do they have?

429
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,360
They've got more apples than that.
What else do they have?

430
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,530
The dividends. Okay. And so
what are the dividends? Well,

431
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,740
you bought Theta Alpha to begin with,

432
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:27,150
so that's d alpha too. So
if you bought, you know,

433
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:31,190
the whole tree, then you've got all
the dividends and similarly with them,

434
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,760
Meda,
meda,

435
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:37,740
the out the Beta to [inaudible].

436
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,220
Okay, so that's it. So the budget's set
is a little more complicated. It's a,

437
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,010
so that's the budget.

438
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,350
So,

439
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:48,370
hey, so let's got to equality's
instead of one. A quality is already,

440
00:26:48,371 --> 00:26:52,060
things look a little more complicated now.
So an equilibrium is going to happen.

441
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:56,100
The Bay that uh,
I chooses

442
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,530
x,
I want x to Seda,

443
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:07,530
uh, Alpha. You know, I could
write a seda I Alfa Feta,

444
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,880
I beda

445
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,490
it's all the choices he has.

446
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,100
Uh,
to maximize,

447
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,420
ew,
I subject to this budget set.

448
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:31,130
Okay, so a is going to pick,
you know, what shares to hold,

449
00:27:31,131 --> 00:27:32,810
how much to to consume today.

450
00:27:32,811 --> 00:27:36,200
And then of course looking forward is
going to be able to figure out what he's

451
00:27:36,201 --> 00:27:39,080
going to end up consuming
tomorrow. All right, so

452
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:44,290
and now in equilibrium we have to have
that x a one plus x B one has to equal e

453
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:49,520
a one plus e a e B one.

454
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,380
Okay. And x a two. And then,

455
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,690
and then we'll do the shares theta.

456
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:02,290
A Alpha plus theta be
alpha has equal fader bar,

457
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:06,270
Alpha plus theta bar. The Alpha, right.

458
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:11,500
The stock market has to clear and theta
a Beta plus theta B Beta as an equal say

459
00:28:14,391 --> 00:28:16,550
to Barb a fade.
Huh?

460
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,120
Let's say the bar be bait.
Huh?

461
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,910
Hazel in period one,

462
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,750
the demand for apples has to equal
the supply of all the agents.

463
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,010
Okay. But now what's the last
equation? This is a little trickier.

464
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:30,990
What's the last step?

465
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:34,860
Equation x.
A two plus x.

466
00:28:34,861 --> 00:28:39,861
B two equals e Ey two plus e be too.

467
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,313
Is that it?

468
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,940
No,
there's something else.

469
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,070
So though the dip,
the apples are right.

470
00:28:51,071 --> 00:28:55,780
The total consumption of apples is going
to be the apples that they have on the

471
00:28:55,781 --> 00:28:59,590
ground, but also the ones that were
picked off the trees. So these dividends,

472
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,600
so it's going to be the total dividends,

473
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,630
switcher Theta Bar,

474
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,720
a Alpha plus Beta bar B
Alpha Times that tree,

475
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,160
the Alpha two plus fade up bar a Beta
plus Theta Bar B Beta Times d beta.

476
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,100
Okay, so, so just to say it in words,

477
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:32,540
it's exactly what we had before except
we have to take into account in addition

478
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,060
to the goods market clearing,

479
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:38,780
we have to take into account that the
stock market has to clear and in the end,

480
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:44,170
demand for goods has to equal the supply
that people had in their endowments,

481
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:48,640
but also what the companies are producing.
These companies are producing output,

482
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,630
you know,
apples.

483
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:52,930
And so that's part of what's the
consumption is going to be in the economy.

484
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:59,230
Okay. Are you with me here as a
good time for questions? Maybe?

485
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,143
Yes.

486
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,790
Could you just explain again
why you don't pick stocks?

487
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,060
Okay.

488
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:12,060
So in period two you might wonder Pi Alpha
is the price of a stock at period one

489
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:19,380
stock Alpha in period one Pi Beta is the
price of the stock Beta in period one.

490
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,310
How come I didn't write down list price
of the stocks and period two and keep

491
00:30:24,311 --> 00:30:28,390
track of what they're holding in period
two and the reason is that when you buy

492
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:32,950
a stock, you're buying it not for the
dividends at the same moment in time,

493
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,160
you don't get those dividends. The guy
who already had it gets those dividends.

494
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:40,120
When you buy the stock, you're buying
it for the future dividends you can get.

495
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,570
And I have assumed the world's going
to end after two periods cause nobody's

496
00:30:43,571 --> 00:30:47,500
utility, you know, cares
about period three.

497
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:52,650
So if you buy the stock in period two
it's too late for you to get anything.

498
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,420
There are no dividends because peer,

499
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,850
you could only get them in period three
and there won't be any dividends in

500
00:30:57,851 --> 00:30:59,980
period three. And if there were,
you wouldn't care about them anyway,

501
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,600
so the stock is worthless to you.

502
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:05,380
So the price of the stock in period
two of both stocks is going to be zero.

503
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:08,620
So there's no point in putting down
what people are buying of the stocks are

504
00:31:08,621 --> 00:31:12,460
selling or anything. It's just not worth
anything. But in general, you're right.

505
00:31:12,461 --> 00:31:14,580
And we're going to be more complicated,
uh,

506
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:19,660
later when you look at your income from
having bought the stocks you'll have as

507
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:23,710
your income, the dividends from the
stocks plus the resale value of the stock,

508
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,570
because you could sell
the stock next period.

509
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,510
But I just know the resale value is going
to be zero because you're in the last

510
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,820
period of the economy.
Okay.

511
00:31:30,821 --> 00:31:35,590
And I just want to keep it
very simple this first time.
So you, it, you could, yeah.

512
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,350
So we'll see, you know, step by step,

513
00:31:38,351 --> 00:31:40,630
you'll be able to keep very
complicated things in your head,

514
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:43,450
but not right the first. Yeah.
So any other questions? Yes.

515
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:44,843
Why are there,

516
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,150
you mean why do people,
um,

517
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,710
having endowments today and next year
because you could think of the endowment

518
00:31:56,711 --> 00:32:00,970
for example as here we've got apples
but usually the endowment is your labor.

519
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,950
So you can work this year.

520
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:07,000
What have you most important endowment
is your energy and your labor.

521
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:10,480
So you've got it this year. Next year
if you're still alive you're going to,

522
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,150
that's new labor that you have.
It's a different good.

523
00:32:13,151 --> 00:32:16,030
So it's a second endowment that you have.
So you know,

524
00:32:16,031 --> 00:32:19,570
I don't want to get caught up in labor
and all that and get involved with marks

525
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:21,820
again.
So I'm just going to talk about apples.

526
00:32:21,821 --> 00:32:24,310
Do you have an endowment of apples
when you're young and next year somehow

527
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:27,900
you're going to have more apples.
So you could think of the,

528
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:31,240
you might have thought that
the only apples next year
coming from what the firms

529
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,580
are producing.
But you know,

530
00:32:33,581 --> 00:32:36,640
I've allowed for the possibility
that people have apples too,

531
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:39,650
just like their labor next
year. Okay. Other questions?

532
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,210
Yeah, we didn't have to
be fine. He to a youtube,

533
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,440
the first few then downs or are they,

534
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,590
is that sort of implied?

535
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,770
Well, this is a, this is e h I
should written this more carefully.

536
00:32:56,771 --> 00:33:01,150
Maybe e and e eight is that,

537
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,200
and this is e B one and B two is that,

538
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:10,723
okay?

539
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:18,750
So as he was suggesting back there,
I have assumed for person B that you know,

540
00:33:18,751 --> 00:33:21,300
he's got an apple now somehow
the world, you know, we,

541
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:25,260
we aren't modeling what happened to get
us here. The guy got an apple today.

542
00:33:25,261 --> 00:33:26,490
They both have an apple today.

543
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,660
Somehow A's also going to have another
apple tomorrow. That a, you know,

544
00:33:30,661 --> 00:33:34,710
he's going to find under his doorstep
somehow that isn't being produced by the

545
00:33:34,711 --> 00:33:38,790
tree. And maybe you can think of it as
Labor that he's gonna have next period.

546
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:41,280
Okay.

547
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,870
All right. So that's it. Fisher says,

548
00:33:44,871 --> 00:33:47,540
as soon as you write down the economy,
mathematically,

549
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,120
all sorts of things are
going to occur to you,

550
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,180
which if you're talking in words
about justice and injustice,

551
00:33:53,181 --> 00:33:55,320
you know you're going to
be lost. So what, what,

552
00:33:55,321 --> 00:33:58,520
what can we get right away out of this?
Uh,

553
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,410
what can we get right away out of this?
Well,

554
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:04,910
the first thing is how
would we define inflation?

555
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,840
What is inflation?

556
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,490
What's inflation? And this economy,
assuming we've got the equilibrium,

557
00:34:16,491 --> 00:34:18,890
which we're going to get soon,
we're going to calculate it,

558
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:20,960
but right now we don't know
what the numbers, you know,

559
00:34:20,961 --> 00:34:23,240
we've got a bunch of equations and stuff.

560
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:27,170
We don't know what x a one in Q one
and Q two are going to turn out to be,

561
00:34:27,171 --> 00:34:29,990
but we're gonna find out very soon.
But before we find out,

562
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:34,520
assuming we've gotten those, what
will inflation B, what is inflation?

563
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,533
Yup.

564
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,310
Well,
we're talking about inflation.

565
00:34:47,311 --> 00:34:50,400
When you talk about the
consumer price index inflation,

566
00:34:50,401 --> 00:34:51,980
what are they talking about?

567
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,673
Yup.

568
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,050
Okay. So inflation is just
Q two over Q one, right?

569
00:34:59,051 --> 00:35:02,230
So that's the price of apples today.
It's the price of apples next year.

570
00:35:02,231 --> 00:35:05,200
If the price of apples next year is bigger
than this year, we've got inflation.

571
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:07,870
If it's lower, we've got deflation.
Okay, so already the model,

572
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:11,510
you're talking about
inflation. Okay, what else?

573
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,740
What's the next most obvious?
Uh,

574
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:17,030
okay.

575
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:17,391
Okay,

576
00:35:17,391 --> 00:35:21,020
well I think I'm going to skip a bunch
of stuff and get now to the key idea.

577
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,480
He idea is arbitrage.

578
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:32,510
Okay. So Fisher says people have,
you know, they have four sites.

579
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,290
They're anticipating what the
dividends are going to be.
They, they, they, they can,

580
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,740
you know, they that, you know,

581
00:35:37,741 --> 00:35:42,240
you can talk about how beautiful the
tree is and how much you like the owners

582
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:44,670
and how much they're
watering it and all kinds of,

583
00:35:44,671 --> 00:35:48,330
what do they have a good plan
for irrigation and you know,

584
00:35:48,331 --> 00:35:51,270
whether they did well in college
and stuff like that. But in the end,

585
00:35:51,271 --> 00:35:54,930
all you care about the trees is what,
how many apples they're going to produce.

586
00:35:55,050 --> 00:36:00,000
So knowing that, can we say something
about Pi Alpha versus Pi Nedo

587
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,510
enact delivery,
what's going to have to happen?

588
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:07,290
They're going to be some connection.
And what's the connection going to be?

589
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:09,840
You've got two trees.

590
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:12,983
Yeah.

591
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:20,020
Right. So Pi Alpha is going
to be Pi Beta at times d.

592
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,340
Um, uh, let's see. Pi Out. Okay.

593
00:36:24,341 --> 00:36:27,910
So Alpha will be better as long as the,

594
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:32,963
okay.

595
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:38,450
Oh, I haven't got, I've got that in the
right order. If, and so in this case,

596
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,480
Pi Alpha is going to equal a half Pi
Beta because Alpha is producing half the

597
00:36:46,131 --> 00:36:47,540
dividend,
the Betas producing.

598
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:51,740
So obviously it's going to turn out
to have half the price that that's the

599
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:55,310
fundamental principle. Okay. We're
doing it in the most trivial case,

600
00:36:55,311 --> 00:36:58,870
but so most fundamental
principle of finance that he's,

601
00:36:58,871 --> 00:37:03,800
we've got two assets and one of them,
they're basically the same up to scale.

602
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,200
Then their prices have to
be the same up to scale.

603
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:11,160
Who's going to bother to buy alpha if it
costs three times, if it costs, you know,

604
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:14,000
the same amount as Beta when
it only produces half as much.

605
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,410
Okay. Yes. Same thing. Same thing.

606
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:24,080
Well it is something like that, but
that's a word that we haven't defined yet.

607
00:37:24,081 --> 00:37:27,800
So we're going to define it in the next
class. So it's something like that. Yup.

608
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,830
Any other,
okay,

609
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:36,960
so that is a very simple thing now.
So polls I added.

610
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:42,480
Suppose I added, okay,
so here's, here's a a

611
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,420
suppose I added.

612
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:50,670
Suppose after finding the equilibrium,

613
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,700
I added a third asset

614
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,910
acid that paid

615
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,710
oh $1

616
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:14,770
period.
Two next year.

617
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:19,750
Okay, now it would have a price.
I've added a third acid gamma.

618
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:25,540
Then what? So Pi Gamma, we'd have to
solve for the equilibrium pie gamma,

619
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,020
and is there some word that I could use?
How could I,

620
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:34,380
so gamma is an asset that
pays a dollar in period two.

621
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,720
It's a bond promising
a dollar in period two.

622
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:42,190
The price of the bond
would then have to be what?

623
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,280
One over one plus I where I is
called the nominal interest rate.

624
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:59,530
So we've got inflation is occurring
in the model. If I added a bond,

625
00:38:59,531 --> 00:39:02,380
which I didn't bother to do because
it's just yet another thing I'd have to

626
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:06,100
write down, I could've had a
third acid, which pays a dollar.

627
00:39:06,101 --> 00:39:09,130
So the others are paying off in an apples.

628
00:39:09,131 --> 00:39:12,640
This one's paying a dollar and
it's priced today. You know,

629
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:16,990
if you pay 80 cents today, it's like
saying I'm paying 80 cents today,

630
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:19,270
I'm getting a whole dollar tomorrow.
So

631
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:24,080
it's like a 25% rate of interest.
Okay.

632
00:39:24,081 --> 00:39:27,510
Because another way of saying it
is that I put in Pike, you know,

633
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:31,520
so one over Pi Gamma's one plus I,
I put only Pi Gammon today.

634
00:39:31,521 --> 00:39:35,360
I get one out tomorrow. So I've gotten
back not only the Pi Gam I put in,

635
00:39:35,361 --> 00:39:40,270
but something extra. That's one plus
the interest rate. Okay? So the,

636
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:43,280
the this world is going to have an
interest rate in and he's going to have

637
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:47,510
inflation in it with me so far. All right.

638
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:51,410
So now Fisher makes his most important.
Okay.

639
00:39:51,411 --> 00:39:55,340
So let me add one more thing. I could
come back to this. So I said that

640
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,220
I said that,
um,

641
00:39:59,500 --> 00:39:59,960
okay.

642
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:04,490
I said that if you take Feta
Alpha less than fader Bar Alpha,

643
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,200
it means you're selling the stock.

644
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,560
So I'm going to allow people to go even
further Theta Alpha less than zero.

645
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,380
Okay?
So let me just write that again.

646
00:40:15,381 --> 00:40:20,381
Theta Alpha less than fader
Bar Alpha means means,

647
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,880
uh,
selling

648
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,790
Alpha Feta Alpha

649
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:29,610
less than zero is doing a
lot more than selling you.

650
00:40:29,611 --> 00:40:33,720
You don't have it to begin with. So how
can you, what are you selling? Well,

651
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:37,830
the mathematics is telling you that
over here they'd Alpha's going to be

652
00:40:37,831 --> 00:40:41,910
negative. You've got your, instead
of getting extra dividends,

653
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:45,750
you're going to be giving up dividends
because it's going to reduce your supply

654
00:40:45,751 --> 00:40:49,980
of money. So Theta Alpha, less
than zero is called selling short.

655
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:57,973
Know

656
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,700
which one I've lost.
That'd be bad.

657
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,700
Okay, so you're, you're, uh, if you can
still hear me, you're selling short.

658
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,870
This means
AC.

659
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,120
You're selling something you don't even,
you don't even have,

660
00:41:27,121 --> 00:41:28,920
or it's also called making selling.

661
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,650
It's also called making a promise

662
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,580
without collateral.

663
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:51,120
Okay?
So I'm going to for now allow for that.

664
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:54,570
So we're not taking into account
that anybody's defaulted.

665
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,580
If you take Feta Alpha negative,

666
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:59,810
it means your income in the future is
going to be reduced because you're going

667
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:03,510
to have to deliver the dividend because
you're going to have negative dividends,

668
00:42:03,511 --> 00:42:07,440
which means effectively you take out of
your endowment those dividends and hand

669
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:11,670
them over. So it's so it's as if
you always keep your promises.

670
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:16,530
So this model, so far, the
official model assumes no default,

671
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,390
no collateral. We're not worrying
about any of that stuff. Okay?

672
00:42:21,391 --> 00:42:23,480
And of course that's going
to be a critical thing. So,

673
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:24,810
okay,

674
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:29,640
you see some things happen that we never
happen had happened before. In the past,

675
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:33,300
you traded money for a football ticket,
you gave up something you wanted,

676
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:37,770
you got something, uh, that you also
wanted. It was a trade of value for value.

677
00:42:37,771 --> 00:42:40,500
Everybody agreed the two things
you traded are equally valuable.

678
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:45,180
If you take Feta Alpha negative by
taking Theta Alpha negative, hey,

679
00:42:45,181 --> 00:42:48,750
that becomes a negative number here.
So it allows you to spend more,

680
00:42:48,751 --> 00:42:53,130
you can buy more goods by taking
Feta Alpha negative, that's negative.

681
00:42:53,131 --> 00:42:57,210
That means this can be more positive
and still satisfy this constraint.

682
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,520
So by selling a stock short,
you're,

683
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:01,770
you're promising to do
something in the future,

684
00:43:01,771 --> 00:43:03,900
you get more money now
you can eat more now.

685
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,930
And then of course you have to consume
less than the future cause you have to

686
00:43:06,931 --> 00:43:11,760
pay back your promise. So you're
exchanging something valuable. You're you,

687
00:43:11,761 --> 00:43:14,820
you know you're getting money. Something
valuable in exchange for a promise,

688
00:43:14,821 --> 00:43:18,180
which is worth nothing until the future.
When you deliver on your promise,

689
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:21,210
when you buy the stock,
you know you're buying part of the tree,

690
00:43:21,211 --> 00:43:22,740
but the trees doing nothing for you.

691
00:43:22,741 --> 00:43:25,290
Now you're doing it because it's
going to be valuable. Next period,

692
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:27,900
you're actually not
physically owning the tree.

693
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:30,870
You're owning a piece of paper that gives
you a right to have the dividends of

694
00:43:30,871 --> 00:43:31,530
the tree.

695
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:34,320
So you're getting something that's only
good because it's a promise you think

696
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:38,700
has been kept. Okay, so so far we're
going for the next few lectures.

697
00:43:38,701 --> 00:43:42,060
We're going to ignore the fact that
people get very nervous when they give

698
00:43:42,061 --> 00:43:45,060
something up that's valuable in exchange
for something. That was just a promise.

699
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:49,080
What? Okay, so a critical
thing has happened here.

700
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,970
So we've kept the same mathematics,

701
00:43:50,971 --> 00:43:54,840
except we've surreptitiously added
this huge assumption. Now Fisher said,

702
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:58,680
having done that,
what can you realize?

703
00:43:58,681 --> 00:44:03,240
This is the most important insight. He
said, this model, it looks so complicated.

704
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:05,460
It looks like now we have
vastly more equations,

705
00:44:05,461 --> 00:44:09,900
no wonder marks and all those religious
zealots. We're getting confused,

706
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:10,943
you know,
uh,

707
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:16,340
we can simplify it all and be back to
where we were before and yet talk about

708
00:44:16,651 --> 00:44:17,484
finance.

709
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:21,690
So Fisher introduced the
idea of present value prices.

710
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:37,680
Okay? So he said, look, when you buy
a stock, what are you really doing?

711
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:40,470
This is the principle of arbitrage.
She says, when you buy a stock,

712
00:44:40,471 --> 00:44:43,380
you're saying to yourself,
I'm giving up money today.

713
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:46,140
Now money today is consumption.

714
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:48,330
Because I would have used that
money if I didn't buy stocks,

715
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,750
I would've bought apples today and
eating them. So when I buy a stock,

716
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:54,750
I'm giving up apples.
Today I'm getting the stock,

717
00:44:54,751 --> 00:44:58,690
which is then paying me dividends
tomorrow, which whatever they are,

718
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,330
I'm selling off. You know, I'm,

719
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:02,850
I'm getting a profit out of the
stock tomorrow and an Emmet,

720
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,530
I'm ending up with Apple's tomorrow.

721
00:45:04,531 --> 00:45:08,160
Maybe I'm just eating the
dividends straight off the
tree. So when I buy a stock,

722
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:13,110
I'm really giving up apples today
and getting apples tomorrow.

723
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,000
And no matter how I do it,

724
00:45:15,001 --> 00:45:20,001
whether it's through stock Alpha or
through stock Beta or through a nominal

725
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,384
bond,

726
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:26,460
it's got to be the case that all three
ways or all 50 other ways you could

727
00:45:26,461 --> 00:45:30,630
imagine doing it half to
give me the same trade off.

728
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,360
This is your yield.
You were talking about the same trade off.

729
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:38,220
The amount of apples I effectively give
up today in order to get apples tomorrow

730
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:43,020
is going to be the same. No matter which
way I do it. If it weren't the same,

731
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:47,550
if, if Alpha is price was more than a
half of Betas, nobody would buy alpha.

732
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,660
In fact, they would start
selling alpha. Okay?

733
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,220
So that's why this assumption is
so important. What would they do?

734
00:45:53,221 --> 00:45:57,090
Not only with nobody by Alpha, but they
start selling it. They'd say, well,

735
00:45:57,091 --> 00:46:01,740
Alpha is so expensive. Uh, you know,
let's say it's the same price as Beta.

736
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:06,330
I can sell Alpha with every elf I sell.
I can buy stock Beta.

737
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,210
And so I haven't done anything today,

738
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:13,410
but in the future I've got stock Beta,
which is paying me to,

739
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:18,180
I owe because I sold stock Alpha Short
I oh one. So I'll pay off the one I,

740
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:20,010
oh and I'll still be left with one.

741
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,100
I'm making an arbitrage profit
and so I'm not going to stop.

742
00:46:23,101 --> 00:46:25,800
It's selling one share of Alpha,
also two shares of apple,

743
00:46:25,801 --> 00:46:26,850
then three shares of Alpha,

744
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:30,000
then a million shares of Alpha
and everybody will be sewing, uh,

745
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:33,390
Alpha short to by Beta.
And, and uh, you know,

746
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:35,160
the market for Alpha will never clear.

747
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,820
So that's why the price is we'll
have to adjust. And so it can't be,

748
00:46:38,821 --> 00:46:41,610
it has to be an equilibrium. And the
price of Alphas, exactly the height,

749
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,430
half the price of Beta,
which is to say in short,

750
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:49,230
that if you solve for this equilibrium,
you can solve for an equilibrium where,

751
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:49,810
um,

752
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:54,810
p one equals Q one is the price today

753
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,680
of an apple today.

754
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:07,710
And P two is the price today,

755
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:12,980
why it's called present value price
price today of an apple next year.

756
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:20,770
Hey,
so if you've got this equilibrium by,

757
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:24,230
by working your way through,
you know,

758
00:47:24,231 --> 00:47:29,030
by figuring out what the price of
Alpha is. A, so the stock for example,

759
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:33,130
you want to figure out what the, what
the stock is supposed to stock of Alpha.

760
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:37,630
Suppose the price turns out to be a half,
okay.

761
00:47:37,631 --> 00:47:39,670
Then by paying a half today,

762
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:44,740
you can buy stock Alpha, which is
going to pay you a whole dividend.

763
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:49,930
Okay? So the price, therefore
have an entire, oh, let's do bait.

764
00:47:49,931 --> 00:47:53,920
I suppose the price of Betas
is a, is a, is a quarter. Okay.

765
00:47:53,921 --> 00:47:57,160
Suppose we happened to find out
that the price of Beta is a quarter.

766
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:58,900
Then what's p two?

767
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:04,540
How much do you have to give up
today in order to get an apple? Well,

768
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:08,890
by paying a quarter today, that's
the price. By paying a quarter today,

769
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:12,040
you're getting to dividends.
So by paying a quarter today,

770
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:14,950
you're getting to dividends.
If you paid to get one dividend,

771
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:19,820
you'd have to pay an eighth
today. So the price, um,

772
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:23,740
p two would be an eighth
in that case. Okay? So by,

773
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,800
by looking piercing through
the veil of the stock market,

774
00:48:26,801 --> 00:48:31,030
you can always figure out what you're
effectively paying today in order to get

775
00:48:31,031 --> 00:48:33,100
an apple next period.
And that price,

776
00:48:33,101 --> 00:48:36,400
which we just computed would be the same
whether we looked at it from the point

777
00:48:36,401 --> 00:48:39,490
of view of going through stock Beta or
through stock alpha through a nominal

778
00:48:39,491 --> 00:48:41,470
bond. And it always have
to give us the same answer.

779
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,680
So we know from the financial equilibrium
we can deduce what p one and p two

780
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:52,240
have to be the present value prices.
And so effectively,

781
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:53,253
furthermore,

782
00:48:56,410 --> 00:49:00,010
uh, stocks the fact of late,

783
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:06,250
just add to the endowment some goods.

784
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:16,870
Okay. So, um, we can now
consider another economy.

785
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:21,790
So let's consider the economy he
hat. So the economy, the hat economy,

786
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:27,060
so you hat of x one and x two
a is the same as it was before.

787
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:30,910
You pay x one x two,

788
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:36,330
you had me of x one and x two
is the same as it was before,

789
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:41,820
but the endowments now he had a won,

790
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,910
he had a two.
She was going to be what?

791
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:48,090
Oh Hey.

792
00:49:48,091 --> 00:49:51,990
Over here began with
one unit of each chord,

793
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:56,760
but a also own all of stock
Elfa and half we'll start Beta.

794
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,390
So all of stock Alpha pays
one dividend the future.

795
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:05,540
So really a effectively has claim on two
apples in the future and another half

796
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,550
of Beta,
which is another apple in the future.

797
00:50:08,551 --> 00:50:13,470
So really a initial
endowment of goods is one.

798
00:50:13,471 --> 00:50:16,950
Three. Okay. How did I get that? Again,

799
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:20,910
I said it was one apple to begin with.
He could anticipate having,

800
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:26,130
he knew he owned all the stock
Alpha. Okay. Which pays one apple.

801
00:50:26,131 --> 00:50:26,851
So that's another one.

802
00:50:26,851 --> 00:50:31,380
That's his and some in the future he's
going to get half of the of the dividends

803
00:50:31,381 --> 00:50:35,300
or stock Beta and half of two was also
once he's got three apples in the field.

804
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:40,320
Sure. And Beta B, I'm sorry,

805
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:45,180
he had beat to,
well his one doesn't change today,

806
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,900
but how many, what's his claim
effectively on dividends in the future.

807
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,093
Okay.

808
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:59,260
One thank you. Somebody answered that. Um,

809
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:04,600
so we've now reduced the financial
equilibrium to a general equilibrium,

810
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,590
the same kind of economy
that we had before.

811
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:13,280
It's just that we had to
augment the endowments to
take into account that people

812
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:16,370
own stuff through the stocks.
Okay,

813
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:20,090
so what's the equilibrium of this economy?
This equilibrium has,

814
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,990
this has a simple general like
Librium. Okay, so what is it?

815
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:25,500
How do we solve for x?

816
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:28,990
Librium well,
take p one equal to one

817
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:35,290
and we'll solve for P two.
So let's just clear the first market.

818
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:36,250
How do you clear it?

819
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,700
You're with me here.
There's a standard general.

820
00:51:40,701 --> 00:51:44,630
Luckily we're in the same kind
we've done many times before. So

821
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:49,930
I'll see if I can do it. So person one
is going to spend a third of his money.

822
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:54,640
And how much money does he have?
He has p one time.

823
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:59,760
So he has one plus p
two times three that's a

824
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,160
right, isn't dominant, is one three.

825
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:07,540
This is his income and he's spending a
third of it on good one. And the price of,

826
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:09,940
go ahead. One P one. Okay,

827
00:52:09,941 --> 00:52:14,770
here it's just one and
then B is going to spend.

828
00:52:14,771 --> 00:52:18,130
He's a half half Cobb.
Doug with sky.

829
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:21,190
So this is one and this is one.

830
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:26,970
He's spending half of his money in
his income is one plus p two times one

831
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:29,170
divided by one

832
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:34,000
and that has to equal the total endowment,
which is two

833
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:39,670
one plus one. So did
I go too fast? I, yes.

834
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,580
Well it's probably wrong. So let's see
if I, let's try it again. You have,

835
00:52:43,581 --> 00:52:48,020
maybe it's two thirds. Okay, so let's
try, uh, let's see what I was, he's

836
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:52,490
doing. I'm saying here are the,
I've taken the financial economy,

837
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:57,440
which was very complicated, looks very
hard to solve and Fisher says, you know,

838
00:52:57,441 --> 00:52:59,630
of course when we add
uncertainty and things like that,

839
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:02,000
we're going to have to do other tricks.
But without uncertainty,

840
00:53:02,001 --> 00:53:06,710
with perfect foresight and so on,
and no one certainty, Fisher says,

841
00:53:06,711 --> 00:53:08,690
this is an easy problem to solve.

842
00:53:08,691 --> 00:53:12,800
You take the financial equilibrium with
all its extra variables and you realize

843
00:53:12,801 --> 00:53:14,030
that people are rational.

844
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:16,730
They're going to see through
all that complicated stuff.

845
00:53:16,731 --> 00:53:19,670
They're going to realize that
Alpha is just half as good as Beta.

846
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:21,950
And so they're going to
realize that by holding stock,

847
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:25,680
they're making a certain trade
off between Alpha and Beta.

848
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:30,950
And we calculated the trade off
p two was going to equal p two

849
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:34,920
p two was going to be,

850
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,900
what was p two I forgot what
Pete two was anyway. The the car.

851
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:41,550
How much did you have to pay?
Okay,

852
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:46,551
if you pay high alpha divided by d
alpha two something like that was p two

853
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:52,990
because by um, okay, so if,

854
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,920
if it costs you a certain amount
of money and you get, you know,

855
00:53:55,921 --> 00:54:00,540
if it costs you a quarter, we
said, and you get a, this was bay,

856
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:05,100
so this is p two. So through either stock,
like bait is the one I solved it for.

857
00:54:05,101 --> 00:54:06,420
I said,
suppose Beta,

858
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:11,470
it's also equal to Pi Alpha or ruddy
alpha two we said if the price of Beta

859
00:54:12,451 --> 00:54:16,800
turns out to be a quarter and you're
getting to dividends than by paying a

860
00:54:16,801 --> 00:54:18,240
quarter,
you get to dividends.

861
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:22,920
So it means to get one apple only cost
you on eighth so affect an eighth of a

862
00:54:22,921 --> 00:54:25,200
dollar.
So p two we could figure out.

863
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,260
So once we've got our
financial equilibrium,

864
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:31,990
it basically is determining a
general equilibrium. So instead,

865
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,150
so let's go backwards.

866
00:54:33,151 --> 00:54:36,210
Instead of solving for the financial
live in that looks complicated.

867
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,280
Let's solve for the general equilibrium.

868
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:42,090
What is the effect of general equilibrium?
It's the same utilities as before,

869
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:46,440
but we've augmented the
endowments according to by
looking through the veil of

870
00:54:46,441 --> 00:54:50,430
the stocks. We realize that a actually
owns three apples in the future.

871
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:54,390
One because he owns all stock Alpha
and another one because he owns half of

872
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:55,224
stock Beta.

873
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:59,010
So we've got the simple economy that
we're used to solving that you did on the

874
00:54:59,011 --> 00:55:02,100
first problem set so we can do it
again and solve it. So I'm going to,

875
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:04,260
I'm going to now solve
for general equilibrium.

876
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:09,500
I have to solve for p one and p two and
all the [inaudible] but I can fix one of

877
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:15,450
the prices to be one. So I'll fix p
one to be one. Then what does a do?

878
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:19,650
So I made a mistake, which is why you
weren't following me a his Cobb Douglas,

879
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:24,480
two thirds of the weight is on
good one and one third on good to,

880
00:55:24,481 --> 00:55:27,900
so he's going to spend two thirds
of his money on the first God.

881
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:31,470
So that's why this should have been a two
thirds that she pointed out. Thank you.

882
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,490
So two thirds of his money. What's
his money's endowment is one. Three.

883
00:55:35,491 --> 00:55:40,491
So it's p one times one which is one times
one plus three times p two divided by

884
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:45,560
the price. P one two thirds of the income
divide by the price of the first chord.

885
00:55:45,561 --> 00:55:49,080
That's how many the first god he wants
to eat. What does she want to do?

886
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:51,000
She's going to spend,
she's patient.

887
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:55,980
She's going to spend half our income
on both goods. So half of her income,

888
00:55:55,981 --> 00:56:00,690
which is one plus p two times one divided
by one. That's so many apples today.

889
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:05,691
She wants and that's what we have to
clear to clear the apple market at time

890
00:56:06,151 --> 00:56:09,150
one. So it's, this makes sense now.

891
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:11,610
Yeah.

892
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:13,690
I'm looking at you in the front.
Do you,

893
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,780
would you agree with this
or is this confusing now?

894
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:20,470
Good. Does this make? Yep.

895
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:24,400
Okay. Someone else all, so do
you this or is this confusing?

896
00:56:24,401 --> 00:56:25,840
I can say it again if it's confusing.

897
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:29,190
Yeah.
Did nominator represents what they want.

898
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:35,460
Okay. Remember how the Cobb
Douglas Work? This is the,

899
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:40,200
this is this trick I'm going to use
over and over again with log utilities.

900
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:43,680
Everybody will spend
depending on the coefficient.

901
00:56:43,681 --> 00:56:45,780
So remember this utility
and the problem set,

902
00:56:45,781 --> 00:56:50,781
you know that this utility is just the
same as if I put two thirds here and one

903
00:56:51,451 --> 00:56:55,320
third here, right? Cause I'm just
multiplying and dividing this by three.

904
00:56:55,321 --> 00:57:00,210
So instead of one and a half.
So the originally utility is this,

905
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,780
right?
It's a,

906
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:07,570
it's log x plus one half log x two.
So the,

907
00:57:07,571 --> 00:57:11,470
some of these things is three.
The sum of this plus this is three halves.

908
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,610
I can multiply by two thirds.
So I've been multiply this by two thirds.

909
00:57:15,611 --> 00:57:19,120
I get two thirds here and one third here,
right?

910
00:57:19,121 --> 00:57:21,070
And I haven't changed
the utility function.

911
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:23,410
And now I know this is a familiar pattern.

912
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,490
A is always going to spend two thirds
of his money on the first short,

913
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,713
okay.

914
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,160
And B,

915
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:35,750
I could multiply this whole utility by a
half and a half and B is going to spend

916
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,810
and now we recognize it as
the common top dog, his thing.

917
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:42,140
And we could say that A's going to spend
half his money in the first good and

918
00:57:42,141 --> 00:57:46,070
half his money on the second
court. Okay, so what have I done?

919
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:49,790
Fisher said, look, this
model is so complicated.

920
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:53,390
You're thinking in your heads
people are deciding and period one,

921
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:56,360
how much stock should I buy?
How many bonds should I buy?

922
00:57:56,361 --> 00:57:59,420
How many apples should I eat?
But really if they're smart,

923
00:57:59,421 --> 00:58:02,180
they're not going to think that way.
They're going to say to themselves,

924
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,790
how many apples should I buy today?

925
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,980
How many apples do I
want to consume tomorrow?

926
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:12,140
All these financial assets are just
methods for me getting apples tomorrow in

927
00:58:12,141 --> 00:58:15,650
exchange for apples today.
And what's the trade off between?

928
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:20,030
The apples was the s p one and p
two is the tradeoff between apples.

929
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:22,280
You could look through
the stocks and all that,

930
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:24,530
but no matter which stock
you think of buying,

931
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:28,610
there's going to be the same trade off
between apples today and Apple's tomorrow

932
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,650
cause of of the no arbitrage.

933
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:34,820
You know the price of Alpha's going to
have to be exactly half the price of Beta.

934
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:39,290
So if I, once I saw for this
economy and get the price of Alpha,

935
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:43,880
I'll know how many apples today I have
to trade off in order to get apples

936
00:58:43,881 --> 00:58:44,714
tomorrow.

937
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,710
So I might as well forget about all the
stocks and just try to figure out what

938
00:58:48,711 --> 00:58:52,610
must that trade off between
p one and p two B. Okay,

939
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:56,510
so that's why you can forget about
the stocks. Forget about the bonds.

940
00:58:56,690 --> 00:59:00,590
Everybody's thinking, I'm trading off
apples today for Apple's next year.

941
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:04,790
I'll make you over trades today because
I'm trading apples today in exchange for

942
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:08,810
promises for Apple's next period.
So it's as if everything happens today.

943
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:11,450
It's as if they're present
value prices today.

944
00:59:11,451 --> 00:59:16,451
We trade today at prices p one and p two
for apples today and Apple's next year.

945
00:59:16,851 --> 00:59:19,070
Of course the apples won't
appear till next year,

946
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:24,220
but I can sell an apple today at price p
one and by promises for apple next year

947
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:29,960
at a price p two and that's the trade off
I'm facing. If I faced that trade off,

948
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:33,560
how much of my money am I
going to spend on apples today?

949
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:37,850
I'm going to spend two thirds of my
money on apples today and the other third

950
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:41,510
I'll spend on promises for
Apple's next period. Okay,

951
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:44,120
so I mean this is a big insight
Fisher had. It's not surprising.

952
00:59:44,121 --> 00:59:47,810
It's a little puzzling. I'm so used to it
that I forgotten how puzzling it is. So,

953
00:59:47,811 --> 00:59:51,710
well, ask me some more questions. This was
not an obvious thought Fisher had. Yup.

954
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:58,243
Okay.

955
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:01,790
Okay. The price, often
there'll be inflation,

956
01:00:01,791 --> 01:00:06,320
so Q2 the contemporaneous price
next period might be higher than the

957
01:00:06,321 --> 01:00:09,530
contemporary and is priced this period.
But we don't care about that.

958
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:14,770
What we care about is how many apples
you have to give up today in order to get

959
01:00:14,991 --> 01:00:17,930
apples tomorrow.
So that's called the present.

960
01:00:17,931 --> 01:00:20,270
So p two is the present value price.

961
01:00:20,271 --> 01:00:23,540
What do you have to give up today
to get the apple next period?

962
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:26,270
So we expect [inaudible]
to be less than p one

963
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:28,040
okay.

964
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,470
Precisely because what
we're going to come to that,

965
01:00:30,471 --> 01:00:33,530
that's the next thing I was going to talk
about because everybody's putting more

966
01:00:33,531 --> 01:00:36,830
weight on consumption today than they
are in consumption in the future.

967
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:40,370
That's why the price p one is going
to be bigger than the price Pete too.

968
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:42,023
Yup.

969
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:49,830
So we're solving for p one and P
two and present value prices. Okay?

970
01:00:49,831 --> 01:00:54,180
So the crucial thing is he invented
this term, present value prices,

971
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:58,530
the prices you paid today, no matter
when you're going to get the stuff.

972
01:00:58,531 --> 01:01:01,910
That's his big insight.
You should look at present value prices,

973
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,920
holding stocks and all that complicated
stuff is just giving you goods in the

974
01:01:06,931 --> 01:01:09,750
future. So when you buy the
stocks today, you should think,

975
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,290
how much am I having to pay today
to get an apple in the future?

976
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:16,260
You can deduce that from the price of
stocks and how many dividends they're

977
01:01:16,261 --> 01:01:20,370
paying. So everybody must have figured
out a p two what does it cost today?

978
01:01:20,371 --> 01:01:24,030
How much money do I have to give up
today to get a PR an apple in the future?

979
01:01:24,031 --> 01:01:26,940
Well, I have to buy a stock and then
sell the dividends and all that.

980
01:01:26,941 --> 01:01:31,140
But really what I should be thinking
about is what's the price today I'm paying

981
01:01:31,141 --> 01:01:33,840
for one apple in the
future and that's p two.

982
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:37,230
And so when you think about it that way,
although it's an intertemporal problem,

983
01:01:37,231 --> 01:01:39,120
it looks like a new model with time.

984
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:43,260
Fisher said you can reduce it as if
they're thinking of it as if they're just

985
01:01:43,261 --> 01:01:46,620
the same problem we did before with two
goods. You're trading at the same time.

986
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:50,460
That's not an obvious thing to a thought
of. No one thought of it before him. Yup.

987
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:04,323
Oh

988
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:07,480
absolutely. So this should have
been a Q two here because you,

989
01:02:07,481 --> 01:02:11,410
you sell the dividend, you can get money
by selling the dividend. Thank you.

990
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:16,060
Oh Ho Ho. Very good.
Who Said who said that?

991
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:20,100
I'd have to who just asked that question?
Are you the okay,

992
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:23,400
I'll remember you. That was very
good. Exactly. So in the future,

993
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,370
you're getting the money for.
So what he pointed out is,

994
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:29,460
I made another mistake here in the future.

995
01:02:29,461 --> 01:02:31,770
The money you're spending
on goods in the future,

996
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:34,380
you're going to get the dividends paid.

997
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:37,260
Of course you can sell the dividends
for money and the price is Q two.

998
01:02:37,261 --> 01:02:40,740
So a Kutu has to appear over here,
just like there's a Q two over there.

999
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:45,000
So it's the goods times the price. That's
the money you're getting in the future.

1000
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,390
And that's the money you're
spending on the good x too.

1001
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:50,913
Yeah,

1002
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:54,710
very good. Too bad you didn't ask
me that a while ago. But anyway.

1003
01:02:56,180 --> 01:03:00,940
Okay. Any other questions? Okay,

1004
01:03:00,941 --> 01:03:03,940
so we're back to this standard
general equilibrium problem.

1005
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:08,020
We can take a financial equilibrium
and turn it into a general equilibrium.

1006
01:03:08,021 --> 01:03:09,220
And so when we solve this,

1007
01:03:09,221 --> 01:03:14,221
we're going to have two thirds plus p two
plus one half plus one half two equals

1008
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:23,380
two. So, um,

1009
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:28,390
looks like three halves. Nope,
I haven't done this wrong.

1010
01:03:28,391 --> 01:03:33,340
P two equals um,
to my

1011
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:42,430
two thirds plus two P two. Thank
you. Yeah, I'll put two P two. Okay.

1012
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:45,450
So we have to be two plus
a half plus a half be too.

1013
01:03:45,451 --> 01:03:48,040
So we have five halves Pete too.

1014
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:51,750
That was lucky you caught
that five halves p two.

1015
01:03:51,751 --> 01:03:54,250
And then over here we have two minus.
Uh,

1016
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:57,420
so two thirds is four six and three.

1017
01:03:57,421 --> 01:04:01,980
Six is nine six and 12
six minus nine six is uh,

1018
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:05,583
what is this?

1019
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,860
So what's two minus two thirds minus
a half five. Six that's correct.

1020
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:16,840
Okay, so p two therefore
equals one third. All right.

1021
01:04:16,841 --> 01:04:19,420
So we've now solved for equilibrium.

1022
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:23,290
We know that p one is gotta be one

1023
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:29,980
p two has gotta be one third.
We know that,

1024
01:04:29,981 --> 01:04:34,660
um, we can figure out what
consumption's going to be.

1025
01:04:34,661 --> 01:04:39,310
I mean x a one for example,
if we wanted to solve for that,

1026
01:04:39,311 --> 01:04:44,230
we just plug in a third here. So we'd
have two thirds times one plus three,

1027
01:04:44,231 --> 01:04:48,820
which is two thirds times of four,
which is eight thirds I guess.

1028
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:54,100
Okay. And you know, eggs be one we can
solve for that too. If we wanted to.

1029
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:59,260
X B one is going to be a half times
four thirds, which is two thirds.

1030
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:02,890
That doesn't, okay. A half plus.

1031
01:05:02,891 --> 01:05:06,760
What was this one third.
So it's one plus one third,

1032
01:05:06,761 --> 01:05:10,720
which is four thirds times a half,
which is two thirds. Is that right?

1033
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:15,343
Okay.

1034
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,100
Oh that doesn't look right.
So maybe I did this

1035
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:21,880
wrong.
One plus one plus one is two.

1036
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:25,060
So this is four thirds.
That looks better. Okay.

1037
01:05:25,061 --> 01:05:28,930
Four thirds x a one is four
thirds XP one is two thirds. Okay.

1038
01:05:28,931 --> 01:05:30,940
So we have four thirds and two thirds.

1039
01:05:30,941 --> 01:05:35,680
And so we could solve similarly for x
eight two and SB two which I won't bother

1040
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:39,190
to do.
So we can figure out what the prices are,

1041
01:05:39,191 --> 01:05:42,940
the present value prices in the present
daily consumption. But having done that,

1042
01:05:42,941 --> 01:05:45,880
Fisher says, okay, we took a
hard problem. You made it easy.

1043
01:05:45,881 --> 01:05:49,000
Let's go back to the hard
problem. Can we? Okay.

1044
01:05:49,001 --> 01:05:54,001
So Fisher says the tradeoff between
good one and good to is one,

1045
01:05:54,521 --> 01:05:58,510
two, a third. So he defined, here's
the nominal rate of interest.

1046
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:01,300
Fisher defined something called
the real rate of interest

1047
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:07,560
and he said that was a variable that
you should pay a lot of attention to.

1048
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:12,980
So the real rate of
interest he said is um,

1049
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:16,200
p one divided by Pete too.

1050
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:24,530
So this is equal to three
and so r is 200% okay,

1051
01:06:25,981 --> 01:06:29,760
so why did I get that?
Just as someone in the front sad,

1052
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,730
the good too is much less expensive.

1053
01:06:32,731 --> 01:06:36,270
The present value of good too is much
less than the present value of good one

1054
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:37,171
people.

1055
01:06:37,171 --> 01:06:42,090
Like people think an apple today is much
more valuable than an apple tomorrow.

1056
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:45,360
So if you give up an apple today,
you can get three apples next year,

1057
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:47,880
just like if you put it.
So if you put an apple in the bank,

1058
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:50,460
it's like getting 200% interest on apples.

1059
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:53,070
So he called it the real rate
and the apple rate of interest,

1060
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:57,060
you put an apple in the bank, you know,
you give up an apple today, buy stocks,

1061
01:06:57,061 --> 01:06:58,050
and when it comes out in the end,

1062
01:06:58,051 --> 01:07:01,140
you've got 200% more apples
than you started with.

1063
01:07:01,141 --> 01:07:04,050
So it's the wheel rate of interest.
Okay,

1064
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:06,180
so that's his crucial variable.

1065
01:07:06,181 --> 01:07:11,010
Now let's go back to the original
equilibrium. What is the stock price?

1066
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:13,650
Assume now that cue,

1067
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:20,010
assume Q one equals one. Okay.
What is the stock price? Pi Alpha.

1068
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:28,930
Okay,
well we can figure it out.

1069
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:31,900
How can we figure it out?

1070
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:39,400
What is Pi Alpha?
Wild Stock Alpha pays one good tomorrow.

1071
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:40,830
Okay,

1072
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:42,000
so what is the price?

1073
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:43,100
Yeah,

1074
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:43,933
of five Lc.

1075
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:49,503
What?

1076
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:53,400
Somebody said it, I
couldn't hear it. A third.

1077
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:54,960
How did I get a third?

1078
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:58,920
Because we figured out that once
everybody looks through the veil,

1079
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:02,190
assuming the price,
p one is one and the price Q one is one.

1080
01:08:02,191 --> 01:08:05,840
If they look through the veil, they're
going to say to themselves, ah Ha,

1081
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:10,350
how much do I have to pay today
to get an apple in the future?

1082
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:13,710
I have to pay a third to
get one apple in the future.

1083
01:08:13,711 --> 01:08:18,290
P One is times p two so to get one app
on the future is only a third of an apple

1084
01:08:18,291 --> 01:08:22,340
today.
So the stock pays one apple in the future.

1085
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:24,920
So therefore,
how much do I have to pay today?

1086
01:08:24,921 --> 01:08:27,410
I have to pay one third of an apple today.

1087
01:08:27,411 --> 01:08:29,480
And since I took the
price of apples to be one,

1088
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:33,020
it's going to be the price of one
third. So what's the price? Beta?

1089
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:37,160
Two thirds. Okay. So Fisher said, look,

1090
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:42,110
we've solved now for all
these financial things. Okay,

1091
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:42,973
so

1092
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:45,243
all right,

1093
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:49,170
so what you can't do Fisher's theory,

1094
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:53,800
Fisher's theory
does not

1095
01:08:56,530 --> 01:09:00,580
explain
how much,

1096
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:04,660
uh,
how much of each stock,

1097
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:10,620
stock, Feta, a et Cetera,

1098
01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:13,630
uh,
the investors hold.

1099
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,720
Why is that? Well,
because it doesn't matter.

1100
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:21,050
That's not enough is
happening in the economy yet.

1101
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:25,220
Alpha and Beta are exactly the same. If
you own twice as much of the Alpha tree,

1102
01:09:25,221 --> 01:09:27,380
you get exactly the same
as having the Beta tree.

1103
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:31,670
So how can you possibly tell whether
somebody is going to hold twice the Alpha

1104
01:09:31,671 --> 01:09:35,510
tree or just one Beta tree? Either
way, he's going to get the same thing.

1105
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,600
So the theory can't possibly explain
which one they're going to do.

1106
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:39,470
Somehow they'll,

1107
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:42,920
they'll work it out and the divide up
the tree so that everybody ends up with

1108
01:09:42,921 --> 01:09:46,340
the right number of apples in the end.
And it also does not explain,

1109
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:50,090
does not explain inflation.

1110
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:54,953
Yeah.

1111
01:09:56,060 --> 01:10:00,890
Okay. Because you can't tell
what Q two is going to be.

1112
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:06,020
All right, because you see in this budget
set, thanks to that inspired question.

1113
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:10,010
If you double Q two Q
two appears everywhere,

1114
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:12,560
you're not going to change
the second equation.

1115
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:15,980
So Q two could be anything
and it uh, you're, you know,

1116
01:10:15,981 --> 01:10:19,310
you can double it or triple it.
It won't matter. Okay. So cute.

1117
01:10:19,311 --> 01:10:22,820
And the same with Q1. It's just
like vol. Ross said before,

1118
01:10:22,821 --> 01:10:26,450
you can always normalized prices to be
one. So the, so the theory, you know,

1119
01:10:26,451 --> 01:10:26,900
if he had,

1120
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:30,260
he had to add another theory of money
and how many dollars were floating around

1121
01:10:30,261 --> 01:10:34,040
in the economy to explain Q2
this theory won't explain it.

1122
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:38,550
So it does not explain inflation
and it does not explain, um,

1123
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:40,400
who holds which stock.

1124
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:45,580
And so it does not explain the nominal
rate of interest does not explain,

1125
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:50,300
hi,
the nominal rate of interest cause $1.

1126
01:10:50,301 --> 01:10:53,930
Who knows what $1 is going to be worth.
It depends on how much inflation we have.

1127
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:58,400
But it does explain the
real rate of interest does

1128
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:01,210
explain are,

1129
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:06,080
and that's the variable that Fisher sends
the one economists should always pay

1130
01:11:06,081 --> 01:11:09,740
attention to. The real
rate of interest. Hey, so

1131
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,800
that's the crucial variable.

1132
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:16,500
So if you want to figure out
what's the price today of a stock.

1133
01:11:16,830 --> 01:11:21,150
So Fisher's famous equations,
the price of a stock today.

1134
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:27,330
Okay,
so Pi Alpha divided by Q one.

1135
01:11:27,331 --> 01:11:30,330
So the real price as somebody said,

1136
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:34,740
the price and terms of gods of the
stock today is always going to equal the

1137
01:11:34,741 --> 01:11:39,741
dividend in the future divided
by one plus r a why is that?

1138
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:43,680
That's exactly what we already used.
Okay.

1139
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:46,500
This is just a rewriting
of the trick we did before.

1140
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:51,360
You take the stock tomorrow and
you multiple it, so you just,

1141
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:56,220
you take the dividend tomorrow,
you multiply it by p two okay.

1142
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:01,280
And then you realize that one plus r is
just p one divided by p two so replacing

1143
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:04,410
the p ones and p twos
by Q one and one plus R.

1144
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:09,830
Today's real stock price is just
the dividends tomorrow discounted.

1145
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:12,330
This is what he called
the fundamental theorem,

1146
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:17,840
fundamental theorem of asset pricing.

1147
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:22,100
So if you knew the real rate of interest,

1148
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:27,140
you'd be able to figure out what all the
stocks were worth just by just like we

1149
01:12:27,141 --> 01:12:30,290
did, you know, once we knew p
one and p to the present value,

1150
01:12:30,291 --> 01:12:34,560
the present value prices determine the
interest rate because they're just,

1151
01:12:34,561 --> 01:12:37,550
as we said,
p one over p two remember it's one plus r,

1152
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:42,730
so knowing p one and p two you're always
normalizing p one two B one that's the

1153
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:44,600
Saint Peter's the same
as one over one plus r.

1154
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:47,570
So if you know p two or
you know one of one plus R,

1155
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:52,490
you know what the value of the stocks are.
That's as critical insight.

1156
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:55,160
Now just to finish in third yes,

1157
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,680
Q one

1158
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,790
he won,
which is the same as p one you know,

1159
01:13:01,791 --> 01:13:06,791
because it's today's price in both
the contemporaneous price today is the

1160
01:13:07,011 --> 01:13:08,510
present value of price today.

1161
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:12,173
Okay,

1162
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:17,500
so let me just end on this
one. Node Fisher said, okay,

1163
01:13:17,501 --> 01:13:20,500
we can take financial
equilibrium without uncertainty,

1164
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:24,070
reduce it to channel equilibrium. We know
everything about general equilibrium.

1165
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:24,641
Therefore,

1166
01:13:24,641 --> 01:13:28,060
we know everything about
financial equilibrium and
we realized that the crucial

1167
01:13:28,061 --> 01:13:30,880
variable in general
equilibrium is relative prices.

1168
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:35,020
There is no just interest rate. The
nominal interest rate. Who the hell cares?

1169
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:38,800
The real interest rate is what we care
about and just be calm. And Justin,

1170
01:13:38,801 --> 01:13:41,950
normal economics,
there's no just relative price.

1171
01:13:41,951 --> 01:13:46,030
There's no just real interest rate.
It depends on people's utilities.

1172
01:13:46,210 --> 01:13:48,820
You make the more patient and the,
you know,

1173
01:13:48,821 --> 01:13:51,370
and that's going to affect the real
interest rate and make them less patient.

1174
01:13:51,371 --> 01:13:52,380
It's going to affect the real industry.

1175
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:54,550
You'll give them more endowments
today versus tomorrow.

1176
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,200
That's going to affect
the real interest rate,

1177
01:13:56,201 --> 01:13:58,060
the relative price between
today and tomorrow.

1178
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:00,070
That's the way you should
think about finance.

1179
01:14:00,071 --> 01:14:02,560
That's the way you should explain what's
going on in the financial markets.

1180
01:14:02,830 --> 01:14:05,680
So in the problem set, you're just
going to do a problem like that.

1181
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:10,780
And then I'm going to give more
interpretations of this that Fisher gave.

1182
01:14:10,870 --> 01:14:12,640
So I guess I'm out of time.
So I'll just stop here.
