1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:05,400
All right. So last time, uh, we began,

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:06,810
or maybe two times ago,

3
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:11,811
we began a discussion of
various vocabulary and facts
you have to know about the

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,350
markets.
If you want to think about finance today,

5
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:19,920
we're going to deal mostly with the
most important one, the most basic one,

6
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:23,760
the yield curve. And last time
we introduced this word yield.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,800
Now yield is an extremely
common expression in finance.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,840
And it turns out not to be that,
um,

9
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,220
well defined often or that useful.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,570
And but the word is so important is
when you so often that it's still hangs

11
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:43,590
around even when probably we
should use different concepts.

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,860
So remember the yield was an attempt to
look at an investment and without paying

13
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:53,040
any attention to the market or
anything outside the investment,

14
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:56,280
just looking at the investment itself,
try to assess,

15
00:00:56,281 --> 00:01:01,281
give a number of quantifying how
attractive the assessment was attractive.

16
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,960
The investment was. So we said you could
apply that to a bond. It has cashflows,

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,720
you can apply it to a hedge fund that's
taking in money and paying out money.

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,310
And,
uh,

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,340
the formula we came up with said that
if the cash flows are given by c one c

20
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:23,640
two, the net cashflow CT over
the course of the period,

21
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,720
then uh, and its price is
some minus a, you know,

22
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:31,680
some price p zero, maybe it's a,
it's a negative cashflow. So see,

23
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,670
so some of these cash flows
might be negative and some
of them might be positive.

24
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:40,530
Then we should just look at the number.
Why such the discounting?

25
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,130
All these things at rate,
why gives you zero?

26
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:51,190
And the why that did that was what we
defined as the yield of the investment.

27
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,100
So we saw that that had some advantages.
For example, in a hedge fund,

28
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:59,910
if you just look at the rate of return
it makes on its money every year.

29
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,420
That doesn't take into account that
some years it's got a lot more money.

30
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:06,750
So if those were the years that lost
money in the ears when it hardly had any

31
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:10,260
money with the years that have made money,
I'm just taking the average,

32
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:14,310
the multiplicative average of all those
geometric average of all those yearly

33
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:16,950
rates of returns would give
a misleading figure. Well,

34
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:21,270
the yield also gives us
somewhat misleading figure
and I don't want to spend too

35
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:25,290
much time on, uh, why
it might be misleading.

36
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,140
Uh,
but I'll give you just an example.

37
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:33,141
Suppose that the cashflows happened
to be one minus four and three.

38
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,570
Now what's the yield to maturity?
Well, there are two of them.

39
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,380
You could have y equals zero because one
over one plus zero plus minus four over

40
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:53,220
one plus zero plus three of one plus zero
is just one minus four plus three that

41
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:58,050
equals zero. So the yield
to maturity of 0%, uh,

42
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,650
the yield of 0% makes this
have present value zero.

43
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,550
But also I could try y equals 200%.

44
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,080
And then I'd have why I put a plus to an
a plus two squared here and I had have

45
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,950
minus one plus one minus four thirds plus
one over three squared is one a three

46
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:24,790
over nine so it's plus one third.

47
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:29,470
So it'd be one minus four thirds
plus one third which also equal zero.

48
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,540
So as the yield to maturity,
the internal rate of return,

49
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,740
0% or 200% it's ambiguous.

50
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,490
So yield to maturity can't be
the right way of doing things.

51
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,890
To go back to the hedge fund example,

52
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,550
you know the hedge fund was a
taking in money, paying out money,

53
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:46,600
taking in more money,

54
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:50,590
paying out money and we
calculated the yield to maturity.

55
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,350
Well suppose that there was some period,

56
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,160
you know here at which point everyone
had taken all their money out so they

57
00:03:57,161 --> 00:04:00,100
hedge fund wasn't actually do
anything for a bunch of years,

58
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:03,250
maybe for a long time.
And then it started up and you know,

59
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,140
took money in and paid
money out and stuff.

60
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,740
Well because the gap in time was
very long with nothing happening.

61
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,790
If you take a positive why the stuff
that happens in the second incarnation of

62
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:16,910
the fund is hardly going to be making
any difference because by that time it'll

63
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,700
all be discounted a lot.
So the yield,

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,800
the yield will depend to sensitively on,
uh,

65
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,030
stuff early rather than stuff
late. And so, uh, again,

66
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,780
you get into troubles yielding
just a yield to maturity.

67
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,980
So that can't be the right thing to do
even though people have done it for years.

68
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,420
So the word however lives on and there's
no getting rid of the word because it's

69
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:41,890
used in common vocabulary.

70
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,730
Now what would Irving Fisher say you
should do if you had to summarize how good

71
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,910
an investment was? What's
his lesson? What do you do?

72
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,430
Okay.

73
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:50,580
Uh,

74
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,200
an investment where there's no doubt
about what the cash flows are going to be.

75
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:59,420
What would he say you should do to
evaluate the attractiveness of it?

76
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,970
What's our lesson? Our main lesson
from Irving Fisher. What would he say?

77
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,003
Yes.

78
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,660
Well, let's say their
cashflows. So it's money,

79
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,940
money that you're going to
get coming in and out. Yeah.

80
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:17,680
He'd say deflate by inflation
and turn them into real, uh,

81
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,220
flows and then do what?

82
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,140
So just continue your answer. So
turn them into actual, you know,

83
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:28,420
potatoes every time you know
apples each time, you know,

84
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,740
the flight by inflation and
then do what with the numbers.

85
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,513
Okay.

86
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,940
This is a simple question.
You're thinking too hard. Yup.

87
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,083
Yes.

88
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,180
Okay. He'd say, just look at the
present value of all these things.

89
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:50,020
So of course to do that you'd have to
know what is the market rate of interest

90
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:52,060
with which to compute the present value.

91
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:56,500
So Fisher would say it's ridiculous
to evaluate how good an investment

92
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:58,790
opportunity is.
Just by looking at the cash flows,

93
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:02,750
you're throwing away too much information.
You know what the market is doing,

94
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,250
you know what the interest rates are,

95
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,230
use the market interest rates
and figure out what the uh,

96
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,660
present value of all the cashflows is.

97
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,520
So we're going to now do
that a bunch of times. Okay.

98
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:19,190
For the rest of the class and see,
see what that means.

99
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,450
So how do you know?
So we have to begin the first,

100
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,750
the two thirds of the class is
going to be spent on the question,

101
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,260
how do you know what the market
rates of interest are based?

102
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,500
So how do you know what the market rates
of interest or how could you find out

103
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,840
what I mean,
what the market rate of interest is.

104
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:37,220
What would you do to find it out?

105
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,413
Yeah.

106
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,800
And if you looked in the newspaper,
say could you find it in the newspapers,

107
00:06:46,801 --> 00:06:48,630
what would you find in the newspapers?
Yep.

108
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:53,540
Okay.

109
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,050
Okay. And so how so? All right. So yes,

110
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:01,620
you try and look at riskless investments
like government bonds where there can't

111
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,700
be to fault. We least, that's
what they always used to say.

112
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,270
It can't be any default.
And an American, uh,

113
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,220
promise America has never
broken government never
broke a promise and they can

114
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:16,070
always print the money. So presumably
they don't have to break a promise.

115
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:17,960
So they're just promising money,
which they can print.

116
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:19,550
So why should they ever
break their promise?

117
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:24,850
So what would you find if you opened a
newspaper you would find for different

118
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:30,200
maturities? Um, used to be up to
30 years for different maturities,

119
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,060
you would find the,

120
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,180
the yield on the various bonds.
Okay.

121
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:42,980
So why would you find the yield? Well, uh,

122
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,590
the yield of various
government bonds of Gov bonds,

123
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,610
why do they quote the yield? Well,
that's just because, you know,

124
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,290
a hundred years ago people started
using the idea of yield and some of the

125
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:01,430
vocabulary as is, uh, been, uh, kept,

126
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,170
even though it's not the best way
of describing what's going on.

127
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:07,850
So for instance,

128
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:12,370
let's just look at some of the yield
curves you might've seen over the last 10

129
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:16,490
or nine years, almost 10
years since December, 2000.

130
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,490
You would see that in
December two thousands,

131
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,260
the yield on the one year bonds,
you know, or the, you know,

132
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:28,880
the short yields were, you know, these
are, this is a log scale. So this is,

133
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:33,410
you know, three, six, 12. Okay.
So the, the shortest bonds,

134
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,800
um, usually have lower yields
than the highest bonds.

135
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,670
But sometimes like in December, 2000,
the yields are almost all the same.

136
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:43,850
That's called a flat yield curve.
Other times,

137
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:48,830
like now we're in this light blue on here.

138
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,920
Like now the short bonds have very
small yields and the long bonds,

139
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,970
much higher yields. Okay, so the
last one is the 30 year bond.

140
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,480
So,
so it's um,

141
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,440
okay,
so you get the yield on every single bond.

142
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:09,720
Now what do you notice about this picture?
By the way?

143
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,590
They can be very different at
different time periods. So,

144
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:18,150
and in December of 2000 the interest rates
were really high. The yields were 6%.

145
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:20,490
I'm talking yields. So far we
haven't talked about interest rates.

146
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:22,260
We have to figure out what the
interest rates are. But anyway,

147
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,430
they're obviously going to be connected.

148
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,400
So the yields were very high in December,

149
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,540
2000 and they've got
much lower in December,

150
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,540
2008 and they've stayed very low.
So why are they so low now?

151
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,090
What got them to be so low now?
Yup.

152
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,560
The Fed flooded the economy with money
at wanting to drive the interest rates

153
00:09:44,561 --> 00:09:45,580
down to zero.

154
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,480
So we're going to see very soon why the
Fed might have wanted it to do that.

155
00:09:49,481 --> 00:09:54,130
But these, these money rates don't
move totally on their own. They're,

156
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,200
they have to do.
And we said that Irving Fisher,

157
00:09:56,201 --> 00:09:59,530
we haven't described Irvin
Fischer's theory of money
and nominal interest rates,

158
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:03,640
but somehow the Fed is controlling the
nominal interest rates and it's changed.

159
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,050
It's changed the yield curve.
So you notice that the yield curve now,

160
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,750
December,
2008 was this blue one.

161
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:15,330
So the Fed in the crisis of 2008 you know,

162
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,420
was terrified and it dropped the
interest rate almost to zero,

163
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,160
virtually zero. And it's kept it there
because from December, 2008 until now,

164
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:27,250
we're at the end of, we're
almost, we're October,

165
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,200
2009 by September 30th,

166
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,580
2009 a long time has passed from this
dark blue to light blue line. And the,

167
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:37,060
and the rate has been kept fixed there.
But in the intervening time,

168
00:10:37,061 --> 00:10:39,820
the long rates have started to go way up.

169
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,590
Now why might that be the case?
What does that suggest to anybody?

170
00:10:44,591 --> 00:10:45,850
Does anybody know?
Yup.

171
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,150
Could, that could be one reason.
And could there be another reason?

172
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,333
Yup.

173
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,320
Okay.
So those are the two reasons.

174
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:05,370
So they somehow know that and some of
you have no idea how they could possibly

175
00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:08,940
be thinking that. And so we're,
I'm going to explain why,

176
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,170
what information is, is there in
the different yield curves. Okay.

177
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:15,930
So the point is that every morning,

178
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:21,170
every single financial analyst wakes
up and sees these yield curves,

179
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:21,691
you know,

180
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:26,430
consults the market and sees where things
are trading and can produce a yield

181
00:11:26,431 --> 00:11:31,050
curve like that. Okay. So, so
you've got a bunch of yields. Now,

182
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,840
what are the yields? Well, let's just

183
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,340
do, uh, an example here.

184
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:43,290
So I'm going to make up an example
which is very easy to compute.

185
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:48,210
So let's try this one. Okay. So suppose,

186
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:52,950
so I'm reading here at the top.
Let's just say that,

187
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:57,930
um, you've got a bunch of different
bonds, a one year bond, a two year bond,

188
00:11:57,931 --> 00:12:00,900
a three year bond, a 40 year
bond, and a five year bond.

189
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,423
Now

190
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,610
each of the bonds was issued, uh,
let's say they were, you know,

191
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:10,361
often they might.

192
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:13,060
And so I'm assuming here that
they're all issued on the same day.

193
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:17,470
So they're issued with different coupons.
Let's say they were all issued today,

194
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:20,080
we'll come back at the end.
You know obviously the,

195
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,840
the treasury doesn't issue
new bonds every single day.

196
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:26,320
So how does this change when you arrive
on a day when they have an issue things.

197
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:30,910
But let's just keep it simple and suppose
that today the treasuries if issued

198
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,640
five different bonds over
these five different years,

199
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,700
now the treasury has to set,
how do they, what do they do?

200
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,420
They decide how much of these bonds
they're going to sell and they decide,

201
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,380
you know what coupon they're going to set.
So they set the coupon.

202
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:49,210
So let's say the coupon they set
was a dollar for the one year bond,

203
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,510
$2 for the two year bond,
$3 for the three year bond,

204
00:12:52,511 --> 00:12:55,870
four for the four year von five for the
five year bond. It's easy to remember.

205
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:57,100
That's why I chose those numbers.

206
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,910
And the face value let's
say is always a hundred.

207
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,410
So why did they set those coupons?

208
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,780
Well because given how
much they want to sell,

209
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,260
they are picking the coupon hoping that
the price turns out to be close to the

210
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:12,130
face value.

211
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:16,980
So let's say when they actually do market
these and a supply equals demand and

212
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,490
aqua,
Lebron,

213
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,490
the prices turn out to be 100.1 a hundred
points to 100.3 100.4 and a hundred

214
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:27,720
0.5 so a hundred 0.5 as the price of the
market's paying for the five year bond.

215
00:13:27,721 --> 00:13:31,170
And if the coupon is five and
they pay coupons once a year,

216
00:13:31,171 --> 00:13:33,930
they actually pay you.
They may pay twice a year,

217
00:13:33,931 --> 00:13:37,590
but let's say they pay once
a year for simplicity, you're
going to get five, five,

218
00:13:37,591 --> 00:13:42,000
five, five and 105 the last year, if
you bought the four year coupon bond,

219
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:46,230
you'd get four, four, four a
hundred for the last year. Right?

220
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,300
So what, okay, so those
are the bonds. Now,

221
00:13:51,301 --> 00:13:53,220
the newspapers not
telling you any of that.

222
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:56,170
So you're sort of losing that information.
Um,

223
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,160
so you don't actually know that
from reading the newspaper.

224
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,850
So then what do you
know? Uh, you know, that,

225
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,320
you know, the, uh, you know, the,

226
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,980
the yields on all these things.
Okay.

227
00:14:10,981 --> 00:14:14,940
So you might hear this tells you
the yield on each of these bonds.

228
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:20,880
Okay. Now, um, yeah,
going back to where I was.

229
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:23,963
Okay.

230
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,710
Okay. If you, knowing the yield,

231
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,640
you could figure out what the price of
each of the bonds is or in fact the way

232
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:33,610
that they calculated the yield
at the newspapers reported.

233
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:38,800
How did the newspapers get the
yield? The newspaper said, well,

234
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,570
for the four year bond,

235
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,560
we're going to say that
a hundred point 400.4

236
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,920
equals four by one plus the four year
yield for the four year coupon bond yield

237
00:14:56,841 --> 00:15:01,841
plus a four over one plus y of four
squared plus four over one plus y o four

238
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,040
cube plus 104 over one
plus y o for the fourth.

239
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,400
Okay. And then the, in this case,

240
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:21,510
because these numbers are all positive,
obviously it's monotonic. And why a four?

241
00:15:21,511 --> 00:15:25,740
So the unique, why a four, which
you can use to solve this equation.

242
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:30,460
Price equals the discounted
value at that yield of, uh, the,

243
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,470
the, the payments. Okay. So that's
how the newspapers, the reporter,

244
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,110
that's how he got all the
yields to show you that graph.

245
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,470
He looked at the market or can call
the bank or something like that,

246
00:15:40,471 --> 00:15:43,650
had a computer screen, you know,
talk to his friends on Wall Street.

247
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,120
He knew the price of all the bonds,

248
00:15:45,121 --> 00:15:48,990
he knew the coupons of all the bonds and
then he produced the yield for all the

249
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:53,760
bonds. So the yield, as I say, it's just,
that's the word that everybody uses.

250
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,180
But really the information that you want
to deal with is the price and what are

251
00:15:57,181 --> 00:16:00,210
the coupon actually pay.
Okay, so that's what you know,

252
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:04,140
everybody knows this every day.
The information I've given every morning,

253
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,960
maybe every few hours
people will update it.

254
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,190
They'll look at what are the coupon
bonds paying and what are the prices,

255
00:16:11,191 --> 00:16:14,430
the thing that's changing, you know,
from hour to hour or the prices.

256
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,520
But we're taking a snapshot at the
beginning of the day and looking at the

257
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:21,180
prices.
So now we've got prices of bonds,

258
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,430
which I'm not call capital pies.

259
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,880
Pi One pi two Pi three five foreign pie
five but now what is fish or say you

260
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:34,580
should do,
what's the most important thing to do?

261
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,670
The most important thing to
do is find the interest rates.

262
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,090
So what does this got to do
with interest rates? Well,

263
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,380
if you modernize Fisher a little bit,
the most important thing,

264
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,600
fish this is,
he didn't put it this way,

265
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:49,460
but this is really what
he must have meant.

266
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:54,670
The most important thing to do
is fine the prices of the Zeros.

267
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,960
So Peak Pie Juan is today's money price.

268
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,550
Today's money price

269
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,260
for $1 at time one.

270
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,460
Hey ty two is today's money price.

271
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,490
$1 at time two Pi three.

272
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,310
Today's money price at
time three and pie five.

273
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,690
Okay,

274
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,800
today's money price at time five.

275
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,840
Okay. Now why do you want to find these
things? Cause once you know these things,

276
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,060
you'd be able to value any investment.

277
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,920
That original investment that we
talked about, which maybe disappeared.

278
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,320
This one.
Um,

279
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,660
it doesn't be hard anyway.
Once you have all the pies.

280
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:53,550
If tells you, you know, how do they ha ha.
If a hedge fund tells you these are the,

281
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,710
these are the, these are the, you know,

282
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,550
this is the revenue I'm going to
produce for you in the next five years.

283
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,800
If they tell you, if a company
says, this is more business plan,

284
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:02,431
we're going to put,

285
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:05,760
we're going to build a factory today
that's going to cost a certain amount of

286
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:09,210
money and we're going to get pro profits
in the next five years, blah, blah, blah,

287
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:12,420
blah, blah. If, uh, um, uh,

288
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,810
a new bond comes on the market and you
don't know how to price and somebody

289
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:18,750
offers you a price for it,
how do you figure out what it's worth?

290
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,030
All you do is you take the cashflows,

291
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,880
the C's that I not very cleverly erased.

292
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:27,210
You take the cash flows and
multiply them by the pies.

293
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,100
So the correct price p is just whatever
the cashflows you're predicting times

294
00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:37,101
these pies that Fisher says what
you should really be finding.

295
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,630
Okay?

296
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:45,290
So nothing could be simpler if you
know now, why is this the right price?

297
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:49,430
Because if you can go in the
market and buy a dollar at time,

298
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:53,120
one for Pi of one and a dollar at
time too for Pi of two, et Cetera,

299
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,710
you can buy all the cashflows from this
investment project by spending this

300
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,813
amount of money.

301
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:03,020
So if the guy is offering you the
investment opportunity at a higher price,

302
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,280
it's crazy to do it.

303
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,550
You could have bought those cashflows
yourself by paying this price.

304
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,040
If he offers it to you at
a lower price than that,

305
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,760
then definitely you should
do it because you can, um,

306
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,140
you know, it's a bargain because
if you had to buy it yourself,

307
00:19:18,141 --> 00:19:19,820
it would be more expensive.
In fact,

308
00:19:19,821 --> 00:19:23,600
you can make an arbitrage profit if he's
offering it to you at a lower price,

309
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:28,130
you can buy it. And how do you buy
it? By selling these very promises,

310
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:32,300
c one c two CT on the market.
And if people believe you that you'll pay,

311
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,650
you can sell it for this price.
So you buy his project for a lower price,

312
00:19:36,651 --> 00:19:39,770
you sell it for a higher price,
you make the difference.

313
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,050
And when it comes time
to keep your promises,

314
00:19:42,051 --> 00:19:44,640
the project has given you the
cash to keep your promises.

315
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,750
So you lock in a profit for sure.
So if you knew the pies,

316
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:51,560
you would know for sure how to value at
any project where you knew for sure the

317
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,530
cashflows, knowing the pies
would tell you how to value it.

318
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,200
And we'll tell you whether it
was attractive or not attractive.

319
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:01,610
You just look at how high the present
value is. Okay? Any questions about that?

320
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:08,430
So we just figure out, we just need
to figure out how did the Deuce,

321
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,170
what the little pies are from the data
that we're going to be given and that we

322
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,000
are given every day by the market.

323
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,010
Okay?

324
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:19,640
Okay.

325
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,640
So I said literally Pi one is the price
you would pay today to buy a dollar

326
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,183
tomorrow.

327
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,690
Now how could you go about buying a
dollar tomorrow given that the only things

328
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:37,310
you can trade on the market are these
treasury bonds, these government bonds.

329
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,760
And I've told you what they pay off and
I've told you what their prices are.

330
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:46,030
So how would you go and buy a dollar
tomorrow and how much would it cost you a

331
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:50,080
dollar next year?
How would you do that?

332
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,400
You can trade, buy or sell any of these
treasury bonds. So, you know, I, I'm,

333
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,290
I in the background, I
keep saying that, uh,

334
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,310
we're going to have to worry
about people defaulting.

335
00:21:04,311 --> 00:21:06,740
We're not quite doing it yet.
So buying a treasury bond,

336
00:21:06,741 --> 00:21:08,090
you need the cash to buy it.

337
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,290
Selling a treasury bond means you
promise to deliver what the Treasury bond

338
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,360
promises and you're selling it.
You know,

339
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:17,690
your promises as good as the governments.
So if you sell it to somebody,

340
00:21:17,691 --> 00:21:22,100
they'll pay you the same government price
for it. So obviously in the background,

341
00:21:22,101 --> 00:21:24,800
you're going to have to do something
to convince the guy you're making the

342
00:21:24,801 --> 00:21:26,630
promise to that you're
going to keep your promise.

343
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:29,150
So we're going to worry about that later.
So for now,

344
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:34,300
when I say that the market for those
treasury bonds clears that those levels,

345
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:40,180
I mean that anybody who wants to can buy
treasury bonds at those levels or can

346
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:41,150
sell them,

347
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,780
even if he doesn't have them at those
prices by making the promise of what the

348
00:21:44,781 --> 00:21:48,170
treasury bond does. Cause we're
assuming the government and you,

349
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,140
everybody is just as reliable.
Everybody's going to keep their promise.

350
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,300
So whether it's the
treasury making the promise,

351
00:21:53,301 --> 00:21:54,950
are you making the promise
of the same thing? Okay,

352
00:21:54,951 --> 00:21:58,130
so how do you buy a dollar next year?

353
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,780
What would you do when the market with
the treasury bonds to get $1 next year?

354
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,710
Yup. Oh, you're not,

355
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,330
I'm prices and then figure out
which button.

356
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,093
Well,
um,

357
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,770
you're supposed to be telling me what
do you want to do and I want to know

358
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:26,570
exactly what to do. You can look
at those numbers. By the way,

359
00:22:26,571 --> 00:22:29,580
are you all following these? I
may be. This was missing serious.

360
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:34,560
There's a one year,
a treasury bond that pays $101 next year,

361
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:39,420
the two year treasury bond pays $2 next
year than a hundred to the three year

362
00:22:39,421 --> 00:22:42,030
treasury bond pays $3 the
end of the first year,

363
00:22:42,031 --> 00:22:45,540
three at the end of the second year, 103
at the end of the third year, et Cetera.

364
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:49,560
Okay. And the one year and treasury bond
happens to be selling for this price.

365
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,840
The two year happens to
be selling for that price.

366
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:57,050
So what can I do with all these
bonds to buy a dollar next year back?

367
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:03,370
All right, go ahead. You've started
a two year bond. It's next year,

368
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:04,270
one year from now.

369
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,373
Bye.

370
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:14,700
I'm asking you how you're a
step ahead of me. I'm saying,

371
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,520
what do you do? Nevermind.
How much does it cost?

372
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,780
What do you do today
to get a $1 next year?

373
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,610
What transaction can you make today?

374
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:29,130
What purchase can you make today
to get yourself $1 next year? Yes.

375
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:37,590
Buy a one year bond.
Well that'll give me $101 next year.

376
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,200
I want $1 next year.

377
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,160
Okay.
Well exactly the point.

378
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,970
It's okay. Right? I take that fraction.
That's what I want you to tell me.

379
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,793
So

380
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,890
Hi.
One is going to be little pie.

381
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:08,891
One is going to be won over 101 times
the price of the one year bond cause the

382
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:12,840
one year bond is paying.
Um,

383
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,590
the one your bond is paying $101.

384
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,740
So you take one 101st of eight you'll
get $1 and whatever the price of the one

385
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:24,020
year bond is actually we know
what that is. It's a 100.1.

386
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:28,220
You know,
that's how much it costs to buy.

387
00:24:28,221 --> 00:24:30,980
One of them costs a hundred
0.1 to get one over a hundred.

388
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:35,720
One of them costs Pi one.
Okay,

389
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:40,721
so this number by the way is some number.

390
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,270
Okay. Which actually, uh, I
of course worked out here,

391
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,240
happens to me 0.991 but
we'll come back to that.

392
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,640
Okay,
so that happens to be 0.991.

393
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,480
So now we know py one well,

394
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:04,510
how would you buy $1 at time
at year two in year two?

395
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:16,580
So there's a way of directly buying
$1 in year two once you know what the,

396
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,310
um,
how the treasury's trade.

397
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:25,170
So what I'm doing is I'm
explaining the idea of replication

398
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,040
replication,

399
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:34,530
a pricing that's giving me pricing
and it's going to lead to arbitrage.

400
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:39,000
They're all basically going
similar ideas here. Okay?

401
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:43,680
So what I want to do is
directly by $1 in year two.

402
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:48,090
So I could probably go to a bank and they
would actually make that trade for me.

403
00:25:48,091 --> 00:25:49,710
I could just call up the bank and say,

404
00:25:49,711 --> 00:25:54,060
I want $1 in year two and they tell me
pie to how much I have to pay for it.

405
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,630
But how are they going to
figure out, uh, what it's worth?

406
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:03,050
They're going to see how they're going
to go out and have to buy the dollar for

407
00:26:03,421 --> 00:26:04,500
me.
Uh,

408
00:26:04,501 --> 00:26:07,310
so they're going to go out and go to the
treasury market and what are they going

409
00:26:07,311 --> 00:26:10,710
to do in the treasury market to come
up with my dollar in year or two?

410
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:15,600
They're going to replicate my purchase
of $1 with a more complicated portfolio

411
00:26:15,601 --> 00:26:17,400
that they can,
but they can actually trade.

412
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,080
And that's how they're going to figure
out how to price my request for $1 in

413
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,500
year two. So what is this bank
going to do on the treasury market?

414
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:33,060
What does it have to do to get $1 for
sure in year two and nothing else.

415
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:44,100
Okay.
For it's one was mentioned

416
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,770
this, but they buy it to your phone
and then settle it when you're mind.

417
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:51,110
Okay. So what are they going to do? How
much of the two year bond should they buy?

418
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,043
Uh,

419
00:26:59,010 --> 00:26:59,843
uh,

420
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,750
the two year bond don't,
you're not selling them,

421
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,040
you're talking about the two year bond.

422
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:10,850
So how much of the two year bond are
they going to buy? One, one o seconds.

423
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,200
That's right. That's very good.
Why is that? Because in year two,

424
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:16,100
we're talking about here too.

425
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:20,450
Now you're to the two year bond pays
102 if you got one over a hundred,

426
00:27:20,451 --> 00:27:24,350
two of those,
you've got $1 in year two.

427
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:28,190
So that's Pi of to,
okay,

428
00:27:28,191 --> 00:27:30,710
so which happens to be a hundred 0.2

429
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:37,160
that's how much that costs. Okay, but
is that all you need to do? I mean,

430
00:27:37,161 --> 00:27:39,200
is that it?
Are you paying the right amount?

431
00:27:39,201 --> 00:27:41,900
Are you paying too much
or what are you doing?

432
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,580
You've got to do more than just that.
Why is that?

433
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,353
Yeah,

434
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,970
close but not quite. Okay, so,

435
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:05,990
so do your reasoning before you got the,
you told me what else to do,

436
00:28:05,991 --> 00:28:10,190
which you slightly miss said,
so why do you have to do anything at all?

437
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:13,990
Tell me the reason why you want to do
something else. You're right. You're,

438
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
you're on the right track. He just
slipped up a little bit. So what do you,

439
00:28:17,001 --> 00:28:19,280
why do you,
why not just stop here?

440
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:28,010
Exactly. So that's exactly right.
By buying the two year treasury,

441
00:28:28,011 --> 00:28:31,220
you got a 102 and period.
You know, you've got, well,

442
00:28:31,221 --> 00:28:33,320
by buying this fraction of the two year,

443
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,680
you got just what you
want in period a too.

444
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,120
But you also purchased the coupon
in period one which you don't need.

445
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:45,230
So that's giving you more than you
needed to buy. You've bought extra,

446
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,920
so you're going to actually
be able to, to uh, the real,

447
00:28:48,921 --> 00:28:53,390
the cost of getting the dollar at the
end of year two is a little bit less than

448
00:28:53,391 --> 00:28:56,000
what we've written so far.
Because you bought more so far,

449
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:58,520
this is buying too much.
You bought the dollar in year two.

450
00:28:58,521 --> 00:29:00,710
You also bought a little bit in year one.

451
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:05,240
You can now sell off the extra stuff
you've gotten in year one to reduce your

452
00:29:05,241 --> 00:29:08,610
cost of buying that. So what should
you do in year one? So you were,

453
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,290
that's exactly what you were thinking.
You just didn't quite say it. Right.

454
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:13,700
So what should you do in year one?

455
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,080
I sell that. Okay. I sell.

456
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:30,320
Okay. So I can get to sell
to have little pie of one.

457
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:36,500
Right. Because I know how much it
costs me to buy a dollar at time one.

458
00:29:36,501 --> 00:29:40,160
Now it's that number so I can see.
So I'm getting, so is that correct?

459
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:43,840
What I've written here? That's what
you said. That's not quite right. Yeah.

460
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,890
Okay. So this is what he meant to say.
So that's fine. You know, it's, it's so,

461
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,200
okay, so that's what you do. Exactly.
So everybody's following you. You,

462
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,550
you agree with me now. Right.
But you know, we could simplify,

463
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,870
we could plug in for this too, by the way.
So Pi of one, we know what that is. Yeah.

464
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,421
Okay.

465
00:30:07,421 --> 00:30:12,421
So does everybody see what's going on
here to buy a dollar at time to you buy,

466
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,640
uh,
you don't get the whole to your treasury.

467
00:30:15,641 --> 00:30:19,690
You buy one 102nd of the two
year treasury. So it costs
you that amount of money,

468
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,330
but that gives you a little
bit of extra time. One,

469
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,010
how much extra does it give you?
Well,

470
00:30:24,011 --> 00:30:28,900
you've got $2 extra for
every two year treasury,

471
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:32,290
but you didn't buy a whole two year
treasury. You bought that fraction of it.

472
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:35,680
So it gives you this much extra,
which you now get to sell off.

473
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,920
So you're going to sell it
off for this price pi one.

474
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:43,810
And of course we can plug in for Pi one
by putting a 101 down here and putting a

475
00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:45,190
hundred 0.1 up here.

476
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,383
Okay.
So that

477
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,770
that was pretty clear. Right? So now, um,

478
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,180
any questions about that?

479
00:30:57,181 --> 00:31:02,181
So that's going to be some number
which I calculated a again,

480
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:08,750
which happens to be 96 2.9619999999999997

481
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,403
yeah.

482
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,540
So notice of course it's getting
cheaper to buy, you know,

483
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,360
how much does it cost to
buy a dollar in year one?

484
00:31:18,361 --> 00:31:21,420
It's that to buy a dollar
in year two is less. Okay.

485
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,140
Now what about Pi three
how would we get pi three

486
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,450
we'll stop it by three.

487
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:31,390
How would we get pi three and then
we're going to find a very fast way of

488
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:35,260
computing all these numbers. What's
by three how would you get that? Yup.

489
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,643
Hi.

490
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,930
So the three year bond costs a hundred
0.3 but we don't need all of it.

491
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:48,200
We just need,
we don't eat all of it.

492
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:52,850
We need one over 103 units times that.
Okay.

493
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,000
So that's, that's our main
cost. But then what else?

494
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,513
Right.

495
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,400
Minus three over one oh three times pot.

496
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,590
Little Pie of too,
right?

497
00:32:10,591 --> 00:32:14,010
Because we got this extra
stuff that we didn't need.

498
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:17,923
Cool.

499
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,070
Okay.

500
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:26,480
So He's saying minus three times
one all three of Pi of one.

501
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:30,320
Okay. Cause we didn't need that.
So is that the right answer?

502
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:39,470
It's not the right answer, but why
it's close. So what did he overlook?

503
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,990
So he said you buy the three year bond.

504
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,050
So by buying the three
or bond you're getting,

505
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,450
if you bought the whole three or bonding,

506
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,460
you get three three 103 you
only want one at the end.

507
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,230
So you have to divide by 103.

508
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:56,500
Now we get three over one oh three
three over one oh three one and so he's

509
00:32:56,721 --> 00:33:00,710
saying we've got two
extra payments, let's, um,

510
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:04,460
sell them off. And so he saw, okay,
so he sold them off like that?

511
00:33:04,461 --> 00:33:06,230
That actually that's correct.
So he sold them off.

512
00:33:06,231 --> 00:33:10,310
And so this one he sold off at Pi two
and this one he sold off at Pi one.

513
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,360
So as you ease making use of the fact
that we've already found out this price

514
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:19,100
and this price, but actually that's
slightly okay. But what would you have to,

515
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,930
so we're talking about
not what you would do,

516
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:23,600
talking to the bank or we're talking about
with the banker would do and he's got

517
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:26,750
a trade in the treasury market.
So how's this guy going to do this?

518
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,490
The banker and the treasury market.

519
00:33:28,491 --> 00:33:33,491
Now this Pi over $2 he's going to have
to hold this complicated portfolio.

520
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:38,100
He's going to, what's he
gonna do to s to, to, to uh,

521
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:39,321
okay.

522
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:43,730
He's going to have to combine the one in
the two year to do this thing and then

523
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:47,240
the one year to undo that thing.
So it's actually going to be,

524
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:53,270
so in terms of trading, if you just had
to trade treasuries, what would you do?

525
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,910
So this is the correct formula?
That's correct.

526
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:58,520
And we can figure out what that is.
Okay.

527
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:03,580
And so the correct formula
is 91.68 91 points.

528
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:08,930
Point nine nine one seven.
Okay.

529
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,000
But you see,
what you've done is,

530
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:15,480
these are the kind of fictitious things
that Irving Fisher has hildas deduce.

531
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,140
What you're really doing in the
market is trading the treasuries.

532
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:21,440
So here you've traded a treasury,
you bought one over a hundred,

533
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:25,310
three units of a three year treasury.
Now what else should you do?

534
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:30,710
You've got a trade treasuries.
How can you sell off the,

535
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:35,690
this amount of money in year two? You
have to sell some treasuries to do that.

536
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,070
So what would you sell

537
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,000
the two year coupon bond?
And so how much of that would you sell?

538
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,310
Well, this is the amount of
money you have to uh, get an,

539
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:01,350
and the two year coupon
bond delivers how much money

540
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,870
delivers 102.
So if you did one over a hundred second,

541
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:12,550
you would get one. So you have
to divide this by 102. Okay.

542
00:35:12,551 --> 00:35:14,740
And that you multiply by the price.

543
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,083
Yes,

544
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:20,400
by the price, which is 0.9
sick by, uh, by the price,

545
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:24,780
which is a hundred 0.2
bay.

546
00:35:24,781 --> 00:35:28,530
So there's that term,
right?

547
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,760
So what have we done here? We've had
to sell off this amount of money.

548
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:34,830
So how can you sell off
this amount of money?

549
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:39,990
Well by selling one over 102 year
treasuries, you're selling off a dollar,

550
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:41,040
but you don't want to sell off a dollar.

551
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:43,590
You want to say all of something smaller
than a dollar. So to that amount.

552
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:47,400
So you're selling that amount
of two year treasuries, but now,

553
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,260
now what do you have to do?

554
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:55,020
Now you see you've bought some one year
dollars by getting the three year coupon

555
00:35:55,021 --> 00:35:58,560
bond and you sold off some but you,

556
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:02,820
but by selling the two year coupon bond,
you've made some promises in year one.

557
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,850
So you've got a net out all of those
things and do the right thing on the one

558
00:36:05,851 --> 00:36:09,720
year coupon bond, right? So
it looks a little complicated,

559
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,590
but you can obviously do it by Algebra.
So everybody following,

560
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,290
you're not following what
the right thing to do is.

561
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:19,410
But let's just say in words
what we've done in words.

562
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:23,100
What we've done is we've said there are
things you can actually trade on the

563
00:36:23,101 --> 00:36:27,060
market. Those are the treasuries,
those are our benchmarks. Securities,

564
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,830
let's call them benchmarks.

565
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:36,580
Now what we're interested in is some
other maybe fictitious securities or new

566
00:36:36,621 --> 00:36:38,930
securities.
The price of the Zeros.

567
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,070
Those are the basic building blocks that
will help us evaluate the present value

568
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,330
of any investment.

569
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:49,700
So the reason why we know these prices
is because we can replicate them by

570
00:36:49,701 --> 00:36:52,670
trading only the benchmarks,
only the treasuries.

571
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,350
So to get the one year zero we just buy
us the correct fraction of one year.

572
00:36:57,351 --> 00:36:59,990
Treasuries do you get the two years zero?

573
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:05,060
We have to buy the correct fraction of
two year treasuries and sell the correct

574
00:37:05,061 --> 00:37:08,600
fraction of one year treasuries.
And that gets us that thing.

575
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:13,250
So we've replicated the two years Ziri
zero by a portfolio consists of being

576
00:37:13,251 --> 00:37:17,210
long for two year treasury and
short the one year treasury,

577
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,770
right?
To get the three years zero coupon,

578
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,620
we have to buy the three year treasury,

579
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:29,210
sell the two year treasury
and do something complicated
that we haven't quite

580
00:37:29,211 --> 00:37:32,180
figured out with yet with
the one year treasury.

581
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:34,610
And that will duplicate
the three years zero.

582
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:38,270
And then we'll just fix and then we'll
just add up the cost of that portfolio

583
00:37:38,271 --> 00:37:41,540
that replicates this. And that must
be the price of that thing. Okay.

584
00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:44,210
So that's what we're doing.
So there are any questions about that?

585
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,180
Are you following this or?

586
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:52,460
Yup.
Quiet

587
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,353
time.
One

588
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,190
today is zero.

589
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,540
So Pi of one is what you pay at
time zero to get a dollar at time.

590
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:09,541
One Pi of two is what you paid today at
time zero you get a dollar at time too.

591
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:14,470
Okay? So knowing those little
pies, you can evaluate the,

592
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:19,510
the price of anything just by multiplying
the little pies by the cash flows in

593
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:22,360
the future.
And now the trick,

594
00:38:22,361 --> 00:38:24,850
this is a trick we're going to
see over and over and over again,

595
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:28,630
the subtlety and finances that they don't
just tell you what the little pies are.

596
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:31,180
You have to figure that out yourself.
Okay?

597
00:38:31,181 --> 00:38:33,730
And so how are you going to
figure out the little pies? Well,

598
00:38:33,731 --> 00:38:36,310
you know that you know the treasuries,

599
00:38:36,311 --> 00:38:38,530
you can trade the treasuries and
you know what those prices are.

600
00:38:38,531 --> 00:38:39,640
You can see it on the market.

601
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:42,790
So by combining the treasuries
in a very clever way,

602
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:46,990
you can end up getting
the prices of all the,

603
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:50,950
the zero coupon bonds, the things
that pay just a dollar at the end.

604
00:38:50,951 --> 00:38:52,780
Why are they called zero coupon bonds?

605
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:58,020
Because it's like you just get principal
at the end of $1 without any coupons in

606
00:38:58,331 --> 00:38:59,770
the middle. So the, the,

607
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:04,420
the little pies are called the zero coupon
prices because the payments are just

608
00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:09,340
$1, you know Pi three is the price of $1
a time three it's as if there was a bond

609
00:39:09,341 --> 00:39:12,700
that paid no coupons and paid a
dollar of principal at time three.

610
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:18,220
So the little pies are the prices of
zero coupon bonds of various maturities

611
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,670
and those aren't really
traded directly in the market.

612
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,190
What's traded directly in
the market where, you know,

613
00:39:25,191 --> 00:39:28,460
pieces of paper change hands
are the treasury bonds,

614
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:33,850
but everybody every day is calculating
the zero coupon prices because that's

615
00:39:34,011 --> 00:39:38,660
what they need to do to evaluate
every single project that they might

616
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,810
conceivably do that day and decide
whether it was a good project or a bad

617
00:39:41,811 --> 00:39:44,840
project. Is it worth the price
or not worth the price. Okay.

618
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:49,220
And it's done by the principal of
replication. Just as we said. Okay.

619
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:52,280
So this formula is going
to be slightly complicated.

620
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,320
I don't know whether
it's worth writing down.

621
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,360
So we've got buying the three year
treasury, the right amount of that.

622
00:39:59,361 --> 00:40:02,960
Then we have to sell a certain amount
of the two year treasury. Okay.

623
00:40:02,961 --> 00:40:05,180
Because we accumulated extra coupons,

624
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:10,660
but now we've also going to be able to
sell a certain amount of the one year

625
00:40:11,481 --> 00:40:15,380
treasuries. And so how much is that going
to be? It's going to be some formula.

626
00:40:15,381 --> 00:40:18,710
Okay. So it's going to keep track of
everything we did and get a formula here.

627
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,800
So I'm actually not going to bother.

628
00:40:21,801 --> 00:40:23,960
I think I was going to write
down the formula of it.

629
00:40:23,961 --> 00:40:28,961
It'll take three minutes to work it out
because there's a much faster way of

630
00:40:29,151 --> 00:40:30,290
getting all these numbers.

631
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:32,500
But

632
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,490
does there is everybody with me hear how
you all understand how I could get this

633
00:40:36,491 --> 00:40:39,820
number if I wanted to do the work to
get it, I'd figure out I had to sell.

634
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,730
You know, I could, you know,

635
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:44,440
I'd sell some of the one year and
buy back some of the two year.

636
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:48,990
I do something complicated
here. Okay. So, sorry.

637
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:53,350
I would do something with the one year
treasury here to compensate for the fact

638
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:56,500
that the three year thing I
bought is paying me coupons here.

639
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:00,250
The two year thing I sold is
reducing some of those coupons.

640
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:04,930
And so it's only the net coupon that I
can sell and on a cell that by selling

641
00:41:04,931 --> 00:41:08,680
the one year treasury. Okay. So that's
how I would get the number there.

642
00:41:08,681 --> 00:41:12,640
And I added the cost of doing all
those things together and I get 0.917.

643
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,640
So,
um,

644
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:17,270
yeah,

645
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:20,370
you're silent, but are you
following it? Who Can I? Okay.

646
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:25,230
So it's too complicated to just figure
this stuff out all the time. All right.

647
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,640
So instead,

648
00:41:26,641 --> 00:41:30,660
there's a very fast algorithm
that you can do almost instantly.

649
00:41:30,661 --> 00:41:34,940
And that's why it's such a triviality
to calculate these numbers every day.

650
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,720
So it's called the principle.
It's the principle of duality.

651
00:41:38,721 --> 00:41:43,420
You go backwards and you say
to yourself, you know, um,

652
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:46,520
what I want is Pi one pi two Pi three,

653
00:41:46,521 --> 00:41:51,521
Pi four and pie five and I've started
to figure out what the replicating puts.

654
00:41:52,581 --> 00:41:55,610
So these are the prices of Zeros,
prices

655
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:02,090
of zero coupon bonds,
zero coupon bonds.

656
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,910
That's what I want.
Want

657
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,080
prices of zero coupon bonds.

658
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:13,340
I have the prices of the treasuries and
the way I'm figuring out the prices of

659
00:42:13,341 --> 00:42:16,790
the zero coupon bonds is by replication.
Now,

660
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:21,350
if somebody's stupidly as
happened in 50 and 60 years ago,

661
00:42:21,351 --> 00:42:26,000
fairly routinely,
if somebody was willing to trade me,

662
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:31,010
you know, to, to someone was
willing to give me a dollar, uh,

663
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,240
in year three and only
asked 90 cents for it,

664
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:39,170
then I would have be
able to lock in a profit.

665
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,640
How can I lock in a profit?
Because I would just, he,

666
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,680
he's willing to give this to me for a low
price of 90 cents instead of 91 cents.

667
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:54,230
So what can I do? Let's say
he's willing to, uh, he would,

668
00:42:54,231 --> 00:42:58,100
he'd pay me, let's say more likely.
Let's say he'd pay me 93 cents.

669
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,340
Say Some guy came to me,
I'm the banker, and he says,

670
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:06,460
I'll pay you 93 cents today to
get a up dollar in year three.

671
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,660
In other words, for three years, zero.

672
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,740
Well I'd say that's wonderful.
I'll,

673
00:43:12,741 --> 00:43:17,180
I'll sell them this promise and
year three of a dollar for 93 cents.

674
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:22,570
Then with that 93 cents I'll only use
91.7 of those senses and I'll go out and

675
00:43:23,211 --> 00:43:25,820
buy the three years zero
and three year treasury.

676
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,930
I'll sell some of the two year treasury
and I'll sell a little bit more of the

677
00:43:29,931 --> 00:43:32,360
one year treasury. And
by doing that and, and,

678
00:43:32,361 --> 00:43:36,590
and that portfolio which I've done by
doing that will pay me exactly a dollar in

679
00:43:36,591 --> 00:43:39,710
year three enabling me to
keep my promise to him,

680
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,560
but it will only have cost me 91.7 cents.

681
00:43:42,561 --> 00:43:46,520
All of made a 1.3 cent profit for sure.
With no chance.

682
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:47,840
It's a pure arbitrage.

683
00:43:47,841 --> 00:43:52,190
I made the profit of 1.3 cents with
no chance of losing any money, okay.

684
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:55,280
Because I've done all the transactions
today and all the government's going to

685
00:43:55,281 --> 00:43:56,240
keep its promises.

686
00:43:56,241 --> 00:43:58,250
I don't have to worry about the
government giving me the money.

687
00:43:58,251 --> 00:44:02,870
And so I'll be able to turn the money over
to that guy in year, uh, in year three,

688
00:44:02,871 --> 00:44:05,270
and meanwhile he's given me his 93 cents.

689
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:08,330
So if you want to do an
arbitrage and make your profit,

690
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:11,120
you have to figure out what
the replicating portfolio is.

691
00:44:11,121 --> 00:44:13,550
And the replicating portfolio
also tells you the price,

692
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:18,260
but it takes a long time to figure out
what all these arbitrage replicating

693
00:44:18,261 --> 00:44:19,370
portfolios are.

694
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,970
And maybe nobody's coming to you and
offering a stupid deal like that.

695
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:26,090
So you don't need to figure out.

696
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:30,620
So the principle of duality is you
don't need to figure out the replicating

697
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:35,520
portfolio to figure out what the Pi one
pi two Pi three Pi foreign pie five bar.

698
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:38,910
I can find those numbers now
just by clicking a button,

699
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:43,930
an XL trivially without bothering
to find the replicating portfolios.

700
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:46,370
Then if some,
you know,

701
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:51,380
bad trader comes to me and offers me 93
cents for the three years zero coupon,

702
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:55,530
then I'll figure out the replicating
portfolio and take advantage of that offer

703
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:58,110
to make a pure profit.
For sure. So I want,

704
00:44:58,111 --> 00:45:02,280
I want to show you now is how to get pie
one through pie five without having to

705
00:45:02,281 --> 00:45:07,050
go through this complicated calculation
and it just reasons backwards.

706
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,070
Okay? So please interrupt if
you're not following this logic.

707
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,510
So it,
you reason like this,

708
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:20,550
we don't know what [inaudible] are,
but if you did know them,

709
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:24,840
you'd be able to price the very
bonds that the market is trading.

710
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:30,080
So you'd know that a 100.1 had to equal
one oh one times Pi of one and you know

711
00:45:32,431 --> 00:45:36,480
that a hundred 0.2 the
two year zero coupon bond,

712
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:41,510
whose prices 100.2 would have
to be two times Pi have two uh,

713
00:45:42,841 --> 00:45:47,841
two times Pi of one plus
102 times Pi have to

714
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:51,460
right?

715
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:55,990
Because Pi of one remember is the price
you pay today for a dollar one year from

716
00:45:55,991 --> 00:45:56,530
now.

717
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:01,530
$101 one year from now costs a 101 if
you knew py one this would be the price.

718
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:03,911
Okay?

719
00:46:03,911 --> 00:46:08,590
If you knew py one in Pi two you could
figure out the price of the zero coupon

720
00:46:08,591 --> 00:46:09,370
bond.

721
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:13,780
I mean the two year treasury bond because
$2 a time one costs two Pi one and

722
00:46:13,781 --> 00:46:18,781
$102 and time to costs Pi two and then
the three years a hundred 0.3 equals

723
00:46:19,811 --> 00:46:24,811
three times Pi one plus three times
Pi two plus 103 times Pi of three.

724
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:33,070
Okay, so et cetera. I know we can go down
to the last wall. Just write them all.

725
00:46:33,071 --> 00:46:34,350
It doesn't take second.

726
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:51,120
Hey in the last one is a hundred 0.5
equals five times Pi one plus five by two

727
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:59,330
most five price three plus five Pi
four plus one oh five by five okay,

728
00:47:03,741 --> 00:47:08,030
so you don't know the little pies but
you do know these prices because the

729
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:12,470
market tells you and you know
the payoffs of all the bonds.

730
00:47:12,471 --> 00:47:14,570
Because that's just written
on there, you know, that's,

731
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:15,950
that's written on them literally.

732
00:47:15,951 --> 00:47:18,410
So you can just read what the payoffs are
and you know the government's going to

733
00:47:18,411 --> 00:47:22,190
keep its promise. So rather than
doing this complicated stuff,

734
00:47:22,191 --> 00:47:25,970
trying to figure out the Pi's,
assume you had the pies,

735
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:29,770
and then if you have the pies, it will
tell you what the prices, everything more.

736
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:32,890
So if you guessed the wrong pies,
you'd get the wrong prices.

737
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,550
But basically you're solving
five equations and five unknowns.

738
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:38,530
And that's what Xcel is so good at.

739
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,700
It's going to start with a wild guess
of the pies and then it's gonna move

740
00:47:42,701 --> 00:47:45,100
around the Pi's until you
match all these prices.

741
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:47,200
And since it's five
equations and five unknowns,

742
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:48,850
you'll hit and they're
all linearly independent.

743
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:51,640
It'll be a unique set of
pis that it'll calculate.

744
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:57,240
But that one set of pis has to be the
replicating portfolio prices because

745
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:03,400
there's only one set of pis that are
going to work and solve these equations

746
00:48:03,401 --> 00:48:05,590
named the ones you got by
the replicating argument.

747
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:10,690
So we can figure out the Pi's by solving
five equations and five unknowns.

748
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:14,890
So that's what I do. So if you, right,

749
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:18,100
if you guessed the pies
one, one, one, one, one,

750
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:24,350
any questions about what I'm
doing? You're right. One one, one,

751
00:48:24,351 --> 00:48:29,000
one, one you're going
to get prices. You know,

752
00:48:29,001 --> 00:48:33,920
for the first one it'll just be 101 and
for the two year it'll be two times one

753
00:48:33,921 --> 00:48:38,921
plus 102 times one is 104 for the
third one with all the Pi's one,

754
00:48:38,961 --> 00:48:41,510
which is obviously not the right thing,
it would be three plus three plus three.

755
00:48:41,511 --> 00:48:45,350
That's a hundred you know,
109 so those are bad prices.

756
00:48:45,351 --> 00:48:48,650
We're trying to match what the
market says the prices are. Okay.

757
00:48:48,651 --> 00:48:52,670
So all I do is I subtract
the market prices were trying
to match from the actual

758
00:48:52,671 --> 00:48:56,750
prices. I look at what the error is,
what you're trying to make a zero.

759
00:48:56,751 --> 00:49:01,730
Then I square the error. And then there's
always, this was adding would be error.

760
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,450
Some see 16 to Ge 16 I added the air.

761
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:10,300
And so I know I want to do my,
my Xcel thing and hopefully I haven't

762
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:14,670
done this, but let's, I,
you know, I got to work.

763
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:17,310
Okay,
so minimize

764
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,013
that,

765
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:25,750
such that by changing cells and
which are the cells I want to change,

766
00:49:26,751 --> 00:49:31,520
I want to change the pies. Those are
the ones that are wrong. So I do that.

767
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:35,110
So I'm minimizing the square
to her by changing the pies.

768
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:37,830
Uh,

769
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:40,040
18 okay.
And I saw,

770
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,340
okay,

771
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:43,980
okay.
And I'm done it and there is the answer.

772
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:49,070
And so you notice that I got the
same prices that I told you about.

773
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:51,780
Oh four by replication,

774
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:58,290
(991) 962-1917, nine,
nine one nine, six, two,

775
00:49:58,291 --> 00:50:01,680
nine one seven et, etc.
Okay, so we got the pies.

776
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:04,440
So that's step one.
All right.

777
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:09,500
So that's what every single financial
firm in the entire world does every single

778
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:13,980
morning and sometimes every single hour.

779
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:17,370
So are there any questions
about what we just did

780
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:25,900
you think you could do you have
to do this in the problem set?

781
00:50:25,901 --> 00:50:28,100
Are there any questions or
anything you about this?

782
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,780
Okay. Now I'm going to start deducing
all kinds of surprising things from this.

783
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:40,230
I hope that you'll be surprised.
So,

784
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,380
but I want to make sure you've got
the concept of what we've done now.

785
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:48,000
Anybody puzzled by it?
Okay,

786
00:50:48,001 --> 00:50:53,001
so somehow Fisher's Pi one pi two Pi
three Pi four Pi five are are going to be,

787
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:57,000
uh,
you know,

788
00:50:57,001 --> 00:51:00,810
deducible from market to what's
going on in the markets every day.

789
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,960
All right, so let's ask one more
thing that's deducible. Suppose I,

790
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,910
I go to a bank and say,
um,

791
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:14,730
I promise to give you
a dollar in year two,

792
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:18,780
how many dollars will you
give me in year three?

793
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,540
What do you think the
bank's going to tell me?

794
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:29,480
Every bank will give me the same
answer. If that yield curve, you know,

795
00:51:29,481 --> 00:51:33,140
given where you know, this morning and
that was this morning's yield curve.

796
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:37,190
If I ask every bank in the world,
I'll give you a dollar new year to you.

797
00:51:37,191 --> 00:51:40,280
Tell me how many dollars you'll,
you know, be willing to give me.

798
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,790
So I'll give you today. So
what am I doing? I'm saying,

799
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:48,590
I promise today to hand over to you
a dollar in year two and you know,

800
00:51:48,591 --> 00:51:53,270
I'm going to keep my promise and in
exchange I want a promise from you to give

801
00:51:53,271 --> 00:51:55,550
me a certain number of
dollars in year three,

802
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:59,270
how many dollars is the bank and
offered to give me in year three?

803
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,820
Every bank will give the same answer.
And what would that answer be?

804
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:09,330
So the thing I'm asking is I'm asking
for what's called the forward interest

805
00:52:09,461 --> 00:52:10,294
rate.

806
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:20,820
Okay? So we've got these things are
obviously very important numbers.

807
00:52:20,821 --> 00:52:22,920
Those are the most important things.
Fisher would say.

808
00:52:22,921 --> 00:52:27,210
Those are the prices you
used to get everything. But
now I want to say something.

809
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:31,380
Um, I'm gonna ask another important
thing, almost as important.

810
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:33,120
I want the forward rate.

811
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:38,450
So one plus I won.

812
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:43,780
Yes, you can see that. I'm glad you
pointed that. Can you see this? Okay,

813
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:49,640
the camera man told me this board
was great. But anyway. Um, so

814
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,700
how about one plus?
Okay.

815
00:52:53,701 --> 00:52:58,701
So I'll write one plus
I won forward is um,

816
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:07,160
uh, by the way, my calling at
one plus zero or one plus one.

817
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:11,640
I clicked,
sorry.

818
00:53:11,641 --> 00:53:14,460
Just want to get my notation straight.

819
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:18,171
Okay,

820
00:53:18,171 --> 00:53:23,171
so let's call one plus I zero
is the one plus I t is the

821
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,710
uh,

822
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:30,050
number of dollars,

823
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:36,120
uh, uh, at t

824
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:37,290
plus one,

825
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,753
uh,

826
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:40,590
in exchange

827
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:46,860
for $1 at t.

828
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:52,330
So this is a number of
dogs, a t plus one, uh,

829
00:53:52,331 --> 00:53:53,610
agreed today.

830
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:01,003
Okay?

831
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:03,211
Okay.

832
00:54:03,211 --> 00:54:08,211
So we agreed today that you're going to
pay this many dollars at time t plus one

833
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:11,760
in exchange for $1 at time t.

834
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:16,110
So why this is like the interest rate
that you might pay at time t you give up a

835
00:54:16,111 --> 00:54:19,500
dollar time t how much do you get at
time? T plus one, the interest rate,

836
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:22,830
but we're not there yet.
We're agreeing to it today.

837
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,730
So today we're agreeing to
this interest rate. Okay?

838
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:28,980
So what is the interest
rate we'd agreed to today?

839
00:54:28,981 --> 00:54:33,420
So we've locked in the rate when it comes
to time t one guy's going to hand over

840
00:54:33,421 --> 00:54:34,140
the dollar.

841
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:38,460
And when it comes to time t plus one
the other guy is going to give back this

842
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:40,620
many dollars. So what is the
rate we would lock in today?

843
00:54:40,621 --> 00:54:44,940
It's called the period t interest rate
forward because we're locking it in today

844
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,650
for a forward period of time.

845
00:54:46,651 --> 00:54:50,070
But it's really just the normal
time t interest rate for one year.

846
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:53,340
But we're locking it in today.
So what would we lock in today?

847
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:55,220
Okay,

848
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:58,620
what? What's that? How do we compute
that? We already know what that number is.

849
00:54:58,621 --> 00:55:00,600
What is it?
Yes.

850
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:07,410
Well I put tea here. So something
like that. What's so what?

851
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:08,803
Fine.

852
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:14,470
Okay. Exactly. That's Pi
ti over Pi t plus one.

853
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,830
That's it. Exactly. So why is that?

854
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:24,690
Right?
So all we're doing is this forward rate.

855
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,090
We're exchanging time ti dollars for time.

856
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:29,760
T plus $1 at this ratio,

857
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:33,120
but where we're committing to do it today,

858
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:38,310
but today we already know what the ratio
is of time t dollars to time t plus $1.

859
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:42,630
We know that pie too is in
fact we know what it is.

860
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:44,430
Pie Two happens to be

861
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:50,730
nine 62 that's a bigger
number than Pi three.

862
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,530
Two from today's point of view,

863
00:55:52,531 --> 00:55:54,990
a dollar time two is worth
more than a dollar a time.

864
00:55:54,991 --> 00:55:59,400
Three we already know how much more a
dollar at time t two is worth than a

865
00:55:59,401 --> 00:56:01,680
dollar at a time.
Three it's the ratio.

866
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:05,480
Pi Two over Pi three so that ratio is,
he says py,

867
00:56:05,481 --> 00:56:10,260
two of over Pi three has to be exactly
the exchange rate that the people are

868
00:56:10,261 --> 00:56:12,450
agreeing to today.
That's, that's what Pi do.

869
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:15,960
Pi Three mean and if you express it
as an interest rate, it's one plus.

870
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,730
The forward interest rate at
that ratio is one plus I f t.

871
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:25,600
Okay. Now why is this okay? Any questions
about that? That's the second. Uh,

872
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,450
Yup,
go ahead.

873
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:36,070
If the yield curve is downward sloping,
yes,

874
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:37,960
you're getting lots of money,

875
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:43,190
you give them a dollar less than a dollar.

876
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:48,310
Okay, so you've made a little mistake
and your premise, so the you could, okay,

877
00:56:48,311 --> 00:56:50,470
so let's, let me, good question,

878
00:56:50,471 --> 00:56:53,800
but let me phrase your question a little
differently so you'll see the answer to

879
00:56:53,801 --> 00:56:57,970
it. The yield curve was, um,

880
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,000
almost flat in year 2000.

881
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:09,320
Okay, so new year in 2000 and you'll
turn was almost flat. In fact,

882
00:57:09,321 --> 00:57:11,720
there are moments where the
yield curve seems to go down.

883
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,390
Okay, so what is that? Uh,

884
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:17,520
yeah.

885
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,970
If the yield curve goes down,
what does that mean?

886
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:27,140
Does that mean that that's like
between year six and year seven,

887
00:57:27,141 --> 00:57:29,370
the year of the yield curve
went down a little bit.

888
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,800
Does that mean that pie
seven is less than Pi six?

889
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:43,220
Maybe, but it couldn't
really be that way. Okay.

890
00:57:43,221 --> 00:57:46,070
So let me translate his
question. He's saying, look,

891
00:57:46,071 --> 00:57:50,930
yield curves very often are flat.
Mostly they go up very often.

892
00:57:50,931 --> 00:57:53,480
They're flat,
sometimes even start to go down.

893
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:58,750
And he said that worries me that
maybe Pi seven is less than Pi six.

894
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:03,020
Okay. But that shouldn't,
so that could never happen.

895
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:05,750
That would be crazy because that would
mean that there'd be a negative interest

896
00:58:05,751 --> 00:58:08,840
rate in the future. And with money that
can never happen. You can store the money.

897
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:11,690
No one's ever going to ask
for a negative interest rate.

898
00:58:11,691 --> 00:58:15,530
He could just keep the dollar and keep
it in his pocket. Okay, so why is that?

899
00:58:15,531 --> 00:58:20,531
So remember Pi six equals one over one
plus the six year yield to the sixth

900
00:58:23,451 --> 00:58:28,451
power and Pi seven equals one over y
plus the seven year yield to the seventh

901
00:58:31,581 --> 00:58:32,414
power.

902
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,440
So it could be that why seven is
less than y six as it is there.

903
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,030
And yet pi seven is still small.

904
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:45,770
Could couldn't be that why seven is
less than y six as it is over there.

905
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,280
But because you're taking this to the
seventh power and this to the sixth power,

906
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,890
you still have pi seven less than by six.

907
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,760
So just because the yield curve is
downward sloping doesn't mean that the pis

908
00:58:55,761 --> 00:58:58,940
are going down, the pis could never go
down. The pies are always going to go up.

909
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:03,890
Okay, so excellent question.
Any other questions?

910
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:07,760
Okay,
so we could get the eyes.

911
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:11,630
Now the eyes will typically be going up.

912
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:14,030
Suppose the yield curve is going up.
By the way,

913
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:19,300
will the eyes be going up faster
or slower than the then the,

914
00:59:19,701 --> 00:59:21,260
um,
then the yields?

915
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:29,590
Yeah. If this is the yield curve
and I calculate the forwards,

916
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:33,910
do you think the Ford's will be going
up faster or less fast than the yields?

917
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,880
All right,
well let's do it in the example.

918
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:44,320
So let's just go back to our
example that we were doing.

919
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:46,310
MMM.

920
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:51,550
Yield curves spreadsheet.
Okay, so maybe I did it here.

921
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:56,520
Hopefully I'm solved at all. Okay, so
here we got the uh, the actual pies.

922
00:59:56,530 --> 01:00:00,760
You see the pies are always
declining, okay? And if we,

923
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:04,420
uh,
now look at the yield curve,

924
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:09,880
you can figure out the yield.
How can you figure out the yield?

925
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,910
Because you solve that formula.
We gave it the very beginning.

926
01:00:12,911 --> 01:00:17,050
You take the price of the, I guess
I've erased it now, you know,

927
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:22,390
okay. You know what the price is to
figure out the yield on the three year,

928
01:00:22,391 --> 01:00:26,170
we just plug in one plus y of three,

929
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:29,770
one plus y of three squared.
One over one plus y are three squared,

930
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:32,920
one over one plus y of three cubed.
And that gives us the yield. Remember,

931
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:35,470
that's how the newspaper
reporter figuring out the yields.

932
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:38,710
So I figured out the yields
in the spreadsheet. Okay,

933
01:00:38,711 --> 01:00:43,450
down here and here are the yields. So this
is what would appear in the newspaper.

934
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:48,160
The one year yield is a little under 1%
the two year yield is a little under 2%

935
01:00:48,161 --> 01:00:51,940
the three years a little under 3% the
four years a little under 4% and the five

936
01:00:51,941 --> 01:00:55,360
here's a little under four
under 5% those are the yields.

937
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:58,060
So what if we did the forwards,
the forage?

938
01:00:58,061 --> 01:01:02,230
Remember just the ratios of these pies.
What are the forwards?

939
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:06,520
They're down here.
So what do they do?

940
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:11,200
Sorry, I don't know how I did that,
but here are the forwards over here.

941
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,870
So the forwards have gone up
much faster than the yields.

942
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:17,831
Hey,

943
01:01:17,831 --> 01:01:22,831
they went from 0.08% which is the same
as that one to 2.9 which is bigger than

944
01:01:23,741 --> 01:01:28,741
2.8 to five which is way more than 3.8
to 7.2 just way more than that to 9.6

945
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:35,470
which is way more than that.
So the forwards went up
much faster than the yields.

946
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:36,281
So why is that?

947
01:01:36,281 --> 01:01:40,360
Obviously gonna be the case whenever
the yield curve is upward sloping.

948
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:42,970
So if we go back to our picture here,

949
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:46,300
mmm.

950
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:52,010
We go back to our picture. If the
yield curve, we're completely flat.

951
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:54,050
What do you think the
forward yields were being?

952
01:01:54,051 --> 01:01:57,380
This is just common sense just to see
if you have any idea what's going on.

953
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,710
If you think about batting averages and
how somebody is average changes each

954
01:02:00,711 --> 01:02:03,320
time he bats.
If the yield curve is flat,

955
01:02:03,321 --> 01:02:07,220
like in 2006 the forwards are
going to basically be flat.

956
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:12,490
But if the yield curve is upward sloping
than the forward yields are going to go

957
01:02:14,061 --> 01:02:15,890
up much faster.
So why is that?

958
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:21,840
Okay.
Well remember

959
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:29,570
the yields that you know,

960
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:34,920
okay,

961
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:39,470
when you do a five year coupon bond,
you're discounting all the cashflows,

962
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:43,140
the previous four cash flows, you're
using the same yield to discount them all.

963
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:46,890
So if you go from year four to year five,
okay.

964
01:02:46,891 --> 01:02:50,730
And you have to raise the yield
a lot. It means, you know,

965
01:02:50,731 --> 01:02:53,910
like if you're a batter
and your average goes up,

966
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,180
it means the last thing you did was better
than the average of what you've done

967
01:02:57,181 --> 01:02:59,570
before. So it's going to be
even higher. You know, if you,

968
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:04,110
if your average was 300 and then you
played a series against the red sox and

969
01:03:04,111 --> 01:03:07,710
which you did very well and your average
one up to three 20 in that series

970
01:03:07,711 --> 01:03:08,640
against the Red Sox,

971
01:03:08,641 --> 01:03:11,610
you obviously did even better than three
20 because you had to average what you

972
01:03:11,611 --> 01:03:15,750
did then with what your previous 300 to
get three 20 so if the average sort of

973
01:03:15,751 --> 01:03:19,260
is going up, remember the yield is
the same thing over the whole history.

974
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:22,140
If when you take a longer history,
the average has gone up.

975
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:25,860
It must mean that the most recent
thing went up really much more. Okay.

976
01:03:25,861 --> 01:03:28,230
So the four year yield
is sort of averaging,

977
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,210
the payoffs are the first four years,

978
01:03:30,211 --> 01:03:33,120
the five year yields averaging it
over five years. So if that yield,

979
01:03:33,121 --> 01:03:36,990
the five year yield has gone up,
what happened in the fifth year?

980
01:03:36,991 --> 01:03:40,650
It must have gone up a lot to bring
the long run average up. Okay?

981
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:43,740
So that's why the the yield curve
is going to go up much faster. Okay,

982
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,140
so we know now to summarize,

983
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:50,250
everybody can look at these pictures
every single day from these pictures.

984
01:03:50,251 --> 01:03:51,750
They can deduce the pies.

985
01:03:51,751 --> 01:03:54,450
That's the crucial variable and
the whole economy of the pis.

986
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:58,560
But a second crucial variable
is the forward yields.

987
01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:02,430
The one plus I F's,
which you can just get by the pies.

988
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:05,310
Now why are the oneplus
I F's so important.

989
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:09,420
We know the pies are critical because
they evaluate every project by multiplying

990
01:04:09,421 --> 01:04:12,930
the cashflows by the pies.
Why are the forwards so important?

991
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:18,860
The forwards are so important
because suppose you believed that.

992
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:24,290
So the forwards, let's go back
to what we got. Okay, so let's,

993
01:04:24,291 --> 01:04:28,300
uh, just look at the number of the
numbers here. Here are the forwards.

994
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:32,610
Remember down here? Okay.
Suppose I said to you,

995
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:37,270
you tell me you don't know
anything about the economy maybe,

996
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:41,100
but you can read the newspapers and do
mathematics like we've just been doing.

997
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:46,260
What do you guessed? The interest
rate's going to be in year two.

998
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:52,140
So this is the zero year for
the one year for the two year,

999
01:04:52,141 --> 01:04:54,270
for the three or four in
the four year forward.

1000
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:57,590
If I say near to what do you
think the interest guess,

1001
01:04:57,610 --> 01:05:00,150
what you think the interest rate's
going to be, what would you guess?

1002
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,530
Yeah,
sure.

1003
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:10,710
Yes.
Right.

1004
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,970
I could do this real interest rate by
doing it for tips official would say do

1005
01:05:14,971 --> 01:05:19,971
that trouble is that are not traded
as they re coming more and more freely

1006
01:05:21,281 --> 01:05:23,740
traded in the market.
They used to be traded,

1007
01:05:23,741 --> 01:05:28,150
very people didn't want to trade them.
So my classmate,

1008
01:05:28,151 --> 01:05:32,590
Larry Summers, uh, introduced
tips, uh, treasury,

1009
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:37,810
treasury inflation protected
securities and he, you know,

1010
01:05:37,811 --> 01:05:41,350
announced this was a fantastic idea and
it's going to change radically the whole

1011
01:05:41,351 --> 01:05:44,540
markets and the,
nobody traded them and they,

1012
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:48,100
they offered astronomical,
uh, interest rates,

1013
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:52,480
real interest rates to get anyone to
buy them. And so they were nicknamed,

1014
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:57,750
it's really bad on camera, but their
nickname became totally illiquid pieces.

1015
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,350
And so that was so,

1016
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:04,680
so the market has not used the
tips to do most of its pricing.

1017
01:06:05,651 --> 01:06:08,350
It uses the treasury bonds,
but yes,

1018
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:12,400
Fisher would say if the tips were
reliable market, you would uh,

1019
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:14,290
use the tips to get
the real interest rate.

1020
01:06:14,291 --> 01:06:16,510
And that's really what you should
care about is the real interest rate,

1021
01:06:16,511 --> 01:06:17,590
not the nominal interest rate,

1022
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:21,430
but we're using the treasury's here
to get the nominal interest rate.

1023
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:24,880
However you've now just dodged
my question. My question was,

1024
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:29,890
if I asked you to predict on the basis
of the yield curve in this example,

1025
01:06:29,891 --> 01:06:33,790
and what we've been able to do is what
would you predict the interest rate was

1026
01:06:33,791 --> 01:06:36,520
going to turn out to be two years
from now? The one year interest rate,

1027
01:06:36,521 --> 01:06:37,420
what would you predict?

1028
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:39,293
Okay,

1029
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:07,423
yeah.

1030
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,420
Which forward right?

1031
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:13,403
Neck

1032
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,670
year two and year two.

1033
01:07:15,671 --> 01:07:18,730
What do you think the interest rate
will be between year two and year three?

1034
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:24,910
It's today and we're asking what do you
predict the market rate of interest will

1035
01:07:24,911 --> 01:07:27,550
be in year two between
year two and year three.

1036
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,473
Okay.

1037
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:41,230
Okay. And I too have happens
to be right here are 5% okay,

1038
01:07:41,231 --> 01:07:45,970
so that's the forward.
So 5% you'd predict.

1039
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,153
Okay.

1040
01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:52,820
Okay.
So let me refine that a little bit.

1041
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:55,820
If the world were one of total certainty,

1042
01:07:56,060 --> 01:08:00,680
so everybody trading today had a perfect
forecast of what was going to happen in

1043
01:08:00,681 --> 01:08:01,514
the future,

1044
01:08:01,730 --> 01:08:06,050
then of course the forward rates in the
market today would have to be exactly

1045
01:08:06,051 --> 01:08:08,150
equal to the Ford interest rate.

1046
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:13,250
Because suppose that you knew for sure
the interest rate was going to be 4% in

1047
01:08:13,251 --> 01:08:17,060
year two,
how could the market to a 5% forward?

1048
01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:21,020
That means that some
guy is promising today,

1049
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:22,400
I'll give you a dollar in year.

1050
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:26,690
You give me a dollar in year two and
I'll give you a dollar five in year three

1051
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:28,190
and we're agreeing to that deal.

1052
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,750
But that's a ludicrous thing for him
to do because when he got to year two,

1053
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:36,440
I see you're a two. Right? When he
got to year two, he could simply,

1054
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:39,260
if he knew for sure what was going to
happen in the future and that the rate was

1055
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:44,180
going to be, um, 4% he would just, uh,

1056
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,250
I said it backwards.
What I need,

1057
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:51,260
it's opposing knew for sure the right
was going to be 6% he would be a uh,

1058
01:08:56,170 --> 01:09:00,070
oh yeah. If he knew for sure the right
was only going to be 4% he'd be a fool for

1059
01:09:00,071 --> 01:09:05,071
promising to give the guy 5% today because
in the future when he got the dollar,

1060
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:06,520
what would he do with it?

1061
01:09:06,521 --> 01:09:09,370
Put it in the bank and get it all or
for next year that wouldn't cover his

1062
01:09:09,371 --> 01:09:11,290
promise, he'd be screwed. Okay.

1063
01:09:11,291 --> 01:09:16,150
So if he knows for sure that the rate
two years from now is going to be 4% the

1064
01:09:16,151 --> 01:09:18,220
Ford price right.

1065
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:21,250
Would also have to be 4%
so to say it backwards,

1066
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:24,910
if you assume everybody knows for sure
what's going to happen in the future than

1067
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:29,911
the Ford rates had had bet
would be exactly equal to
what everyone is expecting

1068
01:09:29,981 --> 01:09:31,090
to happen in the future.

1069
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:35,440
To say it slightly differently if you
happen to be the one ignoramus in the

1070
01:09:35,441 --> 01:09:37,660
world who didn't know what's
going to happen in the future,

1071
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,620
but you knew that everybody else who was
trading in the market did know what was

1072
01:09:41,621 --> 01:09:46,330
going to happen in the future and you
saw our forward rate of 5% then you could

1073
01:09:46,331 --> 01:09:48,160
deduce,
even though you were an ignoramus,

1074
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:52,300
that actually two years from now the
interest rate was going to be 5% okay?

1075
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:55,930
So it's just what you said,
but just said a little bit more precisely.

1076
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,200
We're assuming here perfect
certainty about what's going on.

1077
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:03,010
We're assuming the traders who trade
today all are completely convinced of

1078
01:10:03,011 --> 01:10:05,680
what's going to happen in the future.
Okay,

1079
01:10:05,950 --> 01:10:10,050
so let's go back to our picture now.
Um,

1080
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,760
the picture of the zero yield curve.

1081
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:17,020
So what do you think
this blue curve means?

1082
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:21,620
What are the traders convinced
is going to happen in the future?

1083
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:23,510
Assuming the traders. So W, W,

1084
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:26,660
w the second half of the course is
going to be dealing with uncertainty.

1085
01:10:26,661 --> 01:10:28,700
We're now assuming like Irving Fisher,

1086
01:10:28,701 --> 01:10:31,850
that everybody trading today has no
doubt about what's going to happen in the

1087
01:10:31,851 --> 01:10:34,730
future. So what is, what
do we think the, uh,

1088
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,680
what do you think these traders
think about these prices?

1089
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:43,250
What about the interest rates?
We're now in the world today.

1090
01:10:43,251 --> 01:10:46,010
This was September 30th. It's
today. That's this curve.

1091
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:48,320
What do you think traders,

1092
01:10:48,321 --> 01:10:51,710
what does this curve me
making the assumption that
traders today are convinced

1093
01:10:51,711 --> 01:10:55,430
about what's going to happen
next, you know, in the
future, 10 years, in 30 years,

1094
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:59,000
what do we know that they
are convinced of? Yup.

1095
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:02,900
That interest rates are
gonna go up and go up a lot.

1096
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:06,740
They're not just going to go up to 4%
because that's the form that's the,

1097
01:11:06,741 --> 01:11:09,730
you know, the 30 year yield,
they're going to go up the,

1098
01:11:09,731 --> 01:11:12,080
the foreign rates are going
up much faster than that.

1099
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,160
So we could have what they think.

1100
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:17,160
So they think rates are gonna
go way up in the future. Okay.

1101
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:19,600
Much higher than that because
you're starting so low,

1102
01:11:19,601 --> 01:11:22,290
so you're going to have staying low for
a while. So the rates have to go up,

1103
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:25,110
the Ford rates really sharply
to pull the average that high.

1104
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:28,110
So people are convinced that rates
are gonna go up in the future.

1105
01:11:28,111 --> 01:11:31,980
That's what that tells you. And why
would they be convinced to that? Well,

1106
01:11:31,981 --> 01:11:33,930
for the two reasons that
you gave at the beginning,

1107
01:11:33,931 --> 01:11:37,350
one of you said the market is
going to get more productive.

1108
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:41,160
Irving Fisher has already told us that
when the market gets more productive,

1109
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:43,740
you know, you're more optimistic
about what's going to happen later.

1110
01:11:43,741 --> 01:11:45,510
The real interest rate goes up.
And if the,

1111
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:48,210
if inflation's constant and
the real interest rate goes up,

1112
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:50,010
the nominal interest rate goes up.

1113
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:53,640
The other possibility is that the
real interest rate stays the same,

1114
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:55,410
but there's inflation in the future.

1115
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:58,500
The real interest rate plus the
inflation is the nominal interest rate.

1116
01:11:58,501 --> 01:12:02,610
That's another explanation for why people
might expect the nominal interest rate

1117
01:12:02,611 --> 01:12:05,060
to go up. Okay. So you know that, uh,

1118
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:08,820
the market is predicting rates going
up and the two obvious explanations

1119
01:12:08,821 --> 01:12:12,210
according to Fisher is that ease of the
inflation is going to go up or the real

1120
01:12:12,211 --> 01:12:14,550
rate is going to go up. And why
might the real rate go up? Well,

1121
01:12:14,551 --> 01:12:17,340
there are a bunch of reasons but most
likely because productivity is going up.

1122
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:22,020
Okay. So I got one more
surprising conclusion to end this.

1123
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:23,430
Okay.

1124
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:28,430
So if you were certain about
the future and you had a,

1125
01:12:30,290 --> 01:12:33,300
uh,
you had a five year,

1126
01:12:33,301 --> 01:12:35,970
you took the five year coupon bond,

1127
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:41,760
could you tell me what the price of the
five year coupon bond was going to be

1128
01:12:41,761 --> 01:12:45,980
next year?
How would you figure that out?

1129
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:50,530
Assume that everybody is convinced that
the five year coupon bond, that the,

1130
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:54,920
that they, they know the future for
sure. So therefore from the zero curve,

1131
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:57,310
I erased my graph.
This is the last questions are,

1132
01:12:57,311 --> 01:12:58,700
I'll let you go as soon
as you answer this,

1133
01:12:58,701 --> 01:13:02,600
you need to answer this
to do the problem set. Um,

1134
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:08,120
uh, oh, wrong graph. Sorry. Okay.

1135
01:13:08,121 --> 01:13:10,700
It's only take one second to answer this.
Okay.

1136
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:15,530
I'm telling you now that this is what
everybody's looking at in the morning.

1137
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:19,250
Okay. These numbers, they're getting all
the forward rates and stuff like that.

1138
01:13:19,251 --> 01:13:21,440
They're making all the deductions we made.
Now,

1139
01:13:21,441 --> 01:13:24,080
if you suppose that those
people are convinced,

1140
01:13:24,081 --> 01:13:27,050
they don't have any doubt about what's
going to happen in the future because

1141
01:13:27,051 --> 01:13:29,030
they don't have any doubt about
what's going to happen in the future,

1142
01:13:29,031 --> 01:13:32,420
you can infer from these prices
what they think about the future.

1143
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:33,650
So the question is,

1144
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:38,090
can you infer what the price
of the five year treasury,

1145
01:13:38,091 --> 01:13:43,091
which is now 100.5 that five year bond
is a hundred 0.5 next year it'll only be

1146
01:13:43,221 --> 01:13:46,670
a four year bond. Do we know what
its price is going to be next year?

1147
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:48,520
Yup,
Yup,

1148
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:52,853
Yup.

1149
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:57,210
By what Pi's that you?
Just

1150
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:01,230
those pies,

1151
01:14:01,231 --> 01:14:04,530
but those pies or something slightly
different from those places going to be in

1152
01:14:04,531 --> 01:14:05,700
here later.
Remember?

1153
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:13,290
And what would that,
how would you get that?

1154
01:14:15,710 --> 01:14:16,543
Yup.

1155
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:36,780
Okay. So what you both said is
absolutely correct, unfortunately,

1156
01:14:36,781 --> 01:14:39,210
where two minutes, uh, w we're ending now.

1157
01:14:39,211 --> 01:14:43,530
So let me just end by saying in the
problem set, that's exactly the question.

1158
01:14:43,531 --> 01:14:46,620
What is the five year coupon
going to be priced next year?

1159
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,270
If there's worlds of certainty,

1160
01:14:48,271 --> 01:14:51,660
you're going to know what all the
interest rates are in the future,

1161
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:53,880
and if you know what all the
interest rates are in the future,

1162
01:14:53,881 --> 01:14:56,970
obviously Fisher tells you, you can
figure out what the prices, however,

1163
01:14:56,971 --> 01:14:59,010
to get the exact formula
would take a few minutes.

1164
01:14:59,011 --> 01:15:01,050
And I unfortunately am
a few minutes behind.

1165
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:03,270
So you're going to have to figure
out what the right formula is,

1166
01:15:03,271 --> 01:15:05,780
but it's what he said and
what you were getting to.
