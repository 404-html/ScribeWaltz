1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:05,820
So, so far, where have
we gotten to? We, uh,

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,420
we started summarizing what
general equilibrium was.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,660
We saw that Irving Fischer of Yale
reinvented general equilibrium in order to

4
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:16,110
study finance.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,250
And we saw that just by reinterpreting
the variables of general equilibrium,

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,890
we could start to say a lot
of things about finance.

7
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:27,891
And in particular we had the idea of free
markets and argument in favor of free

8
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:32,640
markets. We had the idea of
arbitrage and no arbitrage.

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,010
So you could deduce a lot of prices
without solving for the whole like Librium

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,980
just by knowing what other
prices are and we deduce,

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,820
and we also learned that the price of
many things is going to have to do with

12
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:47,130
the utility and margin
utilities of people.

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,210
And that's going to have a lot to do
with what their impatience is and whether

14
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:54,150
they're rich people or poor people who,
you know,

15
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:56,280
redistributes redistribution of wealth,

16
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:59,310
who's got the money and how impatient
the people who have the money are.

17
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,690
So those are the basic lessons that
we're going to now carry into the course.

18
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,930
And so for several lectures now I'm
going to leave the abstract theory of

19
00:01:08,941 --> 00:01:12,780
general equilibrium and start
teaching you some of the basic

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,100
vocabulary of finance
that you have to know.

21
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:19,770
And that everybody in finance
knows like what is a mortgage,

22
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:23,430
what's an annuity and stuff like that.
So before I go there though,

23
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:27,990
I want to remind you of
what Irving Fisher done. So,

24
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:33,920
uh, of what Shakespeare had done 300 years
before Irving Fisher. So Irving Fisher,

25
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:38,850
a member, he, he cleared up the
confusion of what interest was. He said,

26
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,760
interest is crystallized impatience.

27
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,830
It's not some horribly unjust thing.
It's not as Marx thought exploitation,

28
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,870
but, but a Shakespeare had
discovered all this 300 years before.

29
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,730
Now when I was your age and are a little
bit younger than you in high school,

30
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:58,470
we all had to read the merchant of Venice.

31
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,710
I have a two Indian coauthors
and who are vaguely my age,

32
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,750
maybe a little bit older,
but anyway, they, um,

33
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,620
so grew up in India and they had
to learn the merchant of Venice.

34
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:12,330
And actually they learned
it a lot better than I did.

35
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:15,240
They both have memorize
the merchant of Venice,

36
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:19,020
they can recite almost the entire
thing by heart. And uh, but anyway,

37
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:21,990
when I was in high school is completely
typical to study the merchant of Venice.

38
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,240
I wonder how many of you
have actually read it?

39
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,740
Who's read the merchant of Venice?
Okay, well, I mean, well this is Yale.

40
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm shocked. Okay, so a quarter
of you have read it. Well,

41
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,460
I recommended the other three
quarters that you do read it.

42
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:39,180
Now when it's taught nowadays,
especially at Yale,

43
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,260
it's taught as a love story and
a commentary on antisemitism.

44
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,750
Now of course, uh, it's both.

45
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,580
It is a love story in a commentary and
antisemitism Shylock the lender is Jewish.

46
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:54,300
And remember what we heard about
the great religions, you know,

47
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:58,590
they're all forbidding lending it
interest except for Judaism would let,

48
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,070
let you Lynne,
low loan money at interest to non Jews.

49
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,450
So Shakespeare whose the money lender
is Jewish and lending it to Christians.

50
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:11,260
And that plays a big role in
the play. Um, and you know,

51
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:12,640
what happens to them and you know,

52
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:16,870
what people say about Judaism
is a big element of the story,

53
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,900
but the way the play is red now,
that's the whole story.

54
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,640
And I don't think it's the whole story.
In fact,

55
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:24,070
I think it's quite an
unimportant part of the story.

56
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:29,170
I think the heart of the story is
Shakespeare's commentary on economics.

57
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,590
And so I'm going to try and argue in
the next 10 minutes that Shakespeare was

58
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:36,820
not only a great writer, a great
psychologist, but a great economist,

59
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,050
and you're going to see that almost all
the elements of the course are in this

60
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:44,650
play. And that if you read it the
way I think you should read it,

61
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:49,480
it should be obvious that it's really
about economics and not about love.

62
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,980
So how do you know that? Well,
the very first line of the play,

63
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,720
Antonio walks in and he says, and
sooth, I know not why I'm so sad.

64
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:00,490
And there's an interlocutor,

65
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,750
a minor character whose name I've
forgotten sylaria or something says, well,

66
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,370
it must be that you're so nervous.
You know, you've got all your,

67
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,080
all your riches are on, on, you know,
on these boats and they're there,

68
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:14,771
they're at risk.

69
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:19,510
And so anyone who had so much money at
risk on boats would naturally be nervous

70
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:22,810
and therefore maybe depressed.
And Antonio says, no, no, no, no.

71
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,680
I'm not worried about the boats because
every boat is on a different ocean.

72
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,070
And so I'm not worried. You know,
they're at a different ocean and they're,

73
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,280
they're sailing at different times.
I'm not worried about my boats.

74
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,900
And so then the interlocutor says,
well, venue must be worried about love.

75
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,820
And he says, no, no, that's not it at all.

76
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,830
So what do we see at the very beginning
of the play? It's business first,

77
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,580
love second,
and secondly,

78
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,690
he understands diversification. Okay, so

79
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,020
now what is the plot of the play?
But Sanyo who?

80
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,340
Harold Bloom. So it happens that
I went to talk to Harold bloom.

81
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:06,280
I saw him and the Whitney humanity center.
Yale's one of the greatest scholars.

82
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:09,280
And among, you know, he's a, he's a
polymath. He knows about everything,

83
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:10,720
but including about Shakespeare.

84
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:14,710
And he is a much advertised
a photographic memory.

85
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,370
So I happened to run into them at
the Whitney Humanity Center, uh,

86
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:21,670
actually in the men's room of
the Whitney humanity center. And,

87
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,890
uh, I asked while we were there,

88
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:28,420
I asked him about,
uh,

89
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,230
the merchant of Venice and whether he
happened to remember the rate of interest

90
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:36,940
that a Shylock ends up charging Antonio.
And he said,

91
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,440
um, he said, dear boy, I
remember almost everything,

92
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,550
but that I forgotten.

93
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,300
It was so unimportant to him that he
didn't even remember the rate of interest.

94
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,950
So,
but he said,

95
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:52,330
I happen to be lecturing
about the merchant of Venice
in my class this afternoon.

96
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:55,660
So I went and heard his lecture and
the merchant of Venice. So Bizani Oh,

97
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:57,860
who's one of the heroes of the play?
Uh,

98
00:05:57,861 --> 00:06:01,760
according to Harold Bloom
is a complete loser.

99
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,300
He's the one who needs
the money to wool Portia,

100
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,650
who is this beautiful,
a woman living outside of Venice.

101
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,400
And so he's got a borrow, a huge
amount of money. So he, when he enters,

102
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:16,250
he's described as a Venetian,
a scholar, and a soldier. Now,

103
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:20,640
whatever Shakespeare says, uh, this,
you know, a scholar and a soldier,

104
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:24,500
sometimes it's not a venetian. When he
says that the guy, always a great guy.

105
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,430
So this occurs repeatedly in Estonia.
Obasanjo comes in as a star,

106
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:32,030
he's a Venetian, a scholar, a
soldier, what more can you want to be?

107
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,110
And so he needs the money to war to whoop
Porsche and he's got a business plan

108
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:38,510
to do it. He's tried wooing
her before, you know,

109
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:42,050
and it's got its come to nothing and he's
lost his money. But he says, you know,

110
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:44,090
if you shoot an Arrow and you lose it,

111
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,650
shoot an Arrow again the same way and
then follow the second era more closely

112
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:50,600
and you'll figure out
where the first Arrow goes.

113
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,960
So he's a man on a business
venture with a business plan.

114
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,700
So here's [inaudible] and
here's a Shylock and Antonio.

115
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,840
Now he needs 3000 duckets and he,
you know,

116
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:05,060
he doesn't have any
collateral or anything.

117
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:09,860
And so he goes to Antonio,
who's an older man and,

118
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,870
uh, you know, according to Harold Bloom,

119
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,990
there's some potential gay
relationship and you know,

120
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:18,530
maybe their lovers and maybe they're not
lovers and you know, there, that's path,

121
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:19,880
the lecture anyway,
so

122
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,540
Shylock Lens, the money, 3000
dockets, and it's so much money,

123
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,730
he has to borrow it from another,
uh,

124
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,540
money lender's going to ball who's
even richer than he is. Okay.

125
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,330
So they argue over what the
interest rate's got to be.

126
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,450
And so Antonio says, uh, oh dear,
I forgotten to change the, the,

127
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,060
so this is out of order. So they argue
over what the interest rate should be.

128
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,710
And Antonio and Shylock,
um, make this argument,

129
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:53,480
Antonio says, you know, it's a disgusting
that you want to charge me interest.

130
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:56,510
I mean, good Christians never charged
interest. I'm appalled that you, you know,

131
00:07:56,511 --> 00:07:59,050
it's because you're Jewish, you're
charging me interest. So he's,

132
00:07:59,051 --> 00:08:02,150
he's throwing epithets and insults at shy,
like,

133
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:06,650
but really he just wants a low
interest rate. And so, um, he says,

134
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,480
Antonio says,
Shylock,

135
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,010
I would neither neither borrow
Norland by taking or giving interest,

136
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,550
but to supply the ripe ones of my friend,
I'll break a custom.

137
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,170
So ripe wants of my friend that's saying
because best Sanyo is so impatient to

138
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:23,690
get his hands on the money
to find, you know, a Porsche,

139
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:25,310
she's going to get married
if he doesn't hurry up.

140
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,040
And Mary are himself
because of his impatience.

141
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,850
He's willing to pay a high rate of
interest. And Shylock says, you know,

142
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:34,970
you're always complaining about
me that I, that I, uh, you know,

143
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:38,150
charge interest in your, you know,
I've left out a whole bunch of stuff,

144
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,780
but you know, I'm patient, you
know, all of us, our patient,

145
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:44,030
that's the badge of our tribe.
We're patient.

146
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,640
And so that's why I'm willing
to lend you the money.

147
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,020
So he or Shakespeare has laid out
and it goes over five patients pages,

148
00:08:51,021 --> 00:08:55,260
patience and impatience.
Okay. So the, in the, uh,

149
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,370
so then they get in an argument
again about interests and, and, um,

150
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,870
uh, uh, okay, so I forgot to slide.

151
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:08,400
So the argument is Antonio tells a
Shylock tells a story. He says, you know,

152
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,780
even in the Bible you say that it's
Unchristian, uh, to lend it interest.

153
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:17,520
But don't you know the story in the
Bible where, where Jacob was asked to do,

154
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:21,090
perform a service in the
field using his fields. Uh,

155
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:24,470
somebody wanted to use this
field for awhile. And so Jacob,

156
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,090
okay can use my fields,
but I have to charge you a fee.

157
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:30,490
And the fee's going to be that.
However it spotted lamb,

158
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,630
many spotted lambs are born.
Those are the ones that I get.

159
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,980
And so it turned out that there was a
huge number of spotted lambs. And so,

160
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:43,050
um, although Jacob had lent some
of his sheep and his fields to,

161
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,580
to the person who wanted them,

162
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,200
he got back vastly more than he lent
the beginning. And so Antonio Answers,

163
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,400
well, this is an interest. This
is a, you know, this is a risk.

164
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:57,210
Jacob got so much more because he took
a risk who would have known how many

165
00:09:57,211 --> 00:10:00,750
lambs were going to be born. And so it's
really, you don't really charge interest.

166
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:02,310
You're just a,
you're an investor.

167
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:07,710
So they haggle over this for awhile
and they come to the conclusion that,

168
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:09,420
uh,
he's going to lend the money.

169
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,330
And so what is the interest that
they actually end up charging?

170
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:17,190
The thing that a Harold bloom
couldn't remember? Well, zero, okay,

171
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:21,870
I'll lend you the money and take no
Dwan of uses for my money's not a single

172
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,520
interest for my money, but they have
to negotiate something else. Something,

173
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,840
uh, besides the rate of interest,
they have to negotiate the collateral.

174
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:35,160
And so they said, so they say, you know,
go with me, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

175
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,480
And then, uh, let the forfeit
be nominated if you don't pay,

176
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:43,590
but the forfeit be an equal pound of
your fare. Flash to be cut off and taken.

177
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:47,370
And what part of your body pleased
with me. Now the other half of the,

178
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:49,350
there were two lectures by Harold bloom.

179
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:53,850
Half the second half of the first lecture
was what part of the body is he really

180
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:58,260
talking about? And there seemed to
be only two possibilities, but uh,

181
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,910
so the heart and another possibility
and Harold bloom favored.

182
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:04,800
The second possibility.
But anyway,

183
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:09,180
it's collateral that they're
putting up for the loan. So, um,

184
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,180
okay, so there's collateral.
So now what happens?

185
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,870
So what we found is that Shakespeare
has understood the impatience,

186
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:19,590
theory of interest. You've got an
impatient bar and a patient lender,

187
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,280
and it's the trade off between
patients and impatience,

188
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,680
which is going to decide
what the rate of interest is.

189
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,050
So that's already Irvin
Fischer's biggest message.

190
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,380
And then the second thing he's noticed,
which Irving Fisher didn't notice at all,

191
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,560
is that w, and this is going to be a
large part of the rest of the course.

192
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,870
How do we know these people are
going to keep their promises?

193
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,030
Why is Antonio going to keep his promises?
Well,

194
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,990
it's because he's putting up collateral
and Antonio is stepping in for Bizani.

195
00:11:42,991 --> 00:11:47,160
Oh. Uh, because, uh, his collateral is
worth more than Bizani owes, you know,

196
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:51,420
shy like once his pound of flesh, not
Bizani. I was pound of flesh. So, uh,

197
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,230
all right. So that's the, that's
the beginning, by the way,

198
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:55,720
just how does the play unfold
against more interesting.

199
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,790
So what happens is after getting his
money, uh, Bassania then goes to woo woo,

200
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,890
fair Porsche. And how does he wore? Well,

201
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:07,810
it turns out the way that her fabulously
wealthy father has set up the marriage

202
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,310
is there three caskets, a gold
one, silver one and a lead one.

203
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,420
And he has to pick one.
And one of them contains her picture.

204
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:18,100
And if you get the one with her picture,

205
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,090
you get to Merrier if you pick the wrong
one. And here's the shocking thing.

206
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:25,990
If you get the wrong one, you swear
before you choose. If you choose wrong,

207
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,870
never to speak to lady
afterward and way of marriage.

208
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,900
So not only don't you get Porsche,
you don't get anybody.

209
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,240
So what is the purpose of this absurd?
A contract?

210
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,380
Well, the purpose is maybe to make sure
that people really want to marry her.

211
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:45,100
Maybe the father set it up so that only
one who really wanted to marry her would

212
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:48,220
bother to enter this competition
because the risk is so high.

213
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:53,080
But another way of saying it is it gives
an excuse to Shakespeare to talk about

214
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:54,940
risk and return. And how, you know,

215
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:58,540
people who have a higher risk or an
expect a higher return and Morocco's you

216
00:12:58,541 --> 00:12:59,320
know,
so that's,

217
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,250
so they talk about risk and return and
Aragon basically says she's really not,

218
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,130
you know, she's not that good looking
to justify such a high risk. But anyway,

219
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:12,010
but all those other guys pick the wrong
casket and bizono picks the lead one and

220
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:15,370
uh, gets her. And so, uh,
so she becomes the wife.

221
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:17,770
And of course she's delighted
by this. He's, she's the one,

222
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,670
he's the one she wanted all
along. And so she says, uh,

223
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,010
let me give you this ring. And, uh,
you know, this is yet a third contract.

224
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:31,800
The first contract is the loan of Shylock.
The second contract is the, is the,

225
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,240
the choosing the caskets and the,
you know,

226
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:36,850
a contract that you won't marry
again if you choose wrong.

227
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:41,050
And now we have a third contract,
which is Porsche deciding that, um,

228
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,780
she gives a ring to besides neo and CFO.
And she says,

229
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,360
let this ring represent your love.
And he says,

230
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:49,210
when this bring parts from this finger,
then parts of life from hands,

231
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:52,720
I'll never lose this ring. I'll
never give it up. I love you so much.

232
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,550
So of course the boat's appear to
sink, you know, calamity appears.

233
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,970
My ships of all ms credited, you know, um,

234
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,250
Shylock wants is
collateral. So Portia, uh,

235
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,390
now who turns out to be incredibly
wealthy. So we realized, again,

236
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:14,170
the play is not about love. She's
beautiful, but she's fabulously rich.

237
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:18,100
Much richer than Shylock is much
less richer than two ball was.

238
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,770
They had to scrounge around
to get the 300 dockets.

239
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,120
She hands 6,000 duckets
and then 12,000 dockets.

240
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:29,830
Then 36,000 Duckett says, look, you know,
offer Shylock all this money. You know,

241
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:34,550
tell him here I've got the money. Tell him
not to take his pound of flesh. So, uh,

242
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,410
they hold a trial to decide
whether Shylock should get
his pound of flesh or not.

243
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:43,500
And so shy by this time is
incredibly pissed off at, uh,

244
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,250
to say the least at Antonio and
beside you. And why is he so angry?

245
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,260
Because among other things,
his daughter,

246
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:55,261
Jessica has run off with a Christian
named Lorenzo and stolen his money.

247
00:14:55,371 --> 00:15:00,140
And so he tells my daughter might
dockets. And so she sells his, uh,

248
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,330
she sold his, his wife's
ring who, um, for,

249
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,110
for a monkey. And he said, or his ring
that was given to him by his wife, Leah.

250
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:11,930
And he says,
I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor.

251
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:14,210
I would not have given it
for a wilderness of monkeys.

252
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,420
So Shylock believes in
keeping his promise.

253
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,760
He would never have broken a promise.

254
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:23,060
He never would have given away the
ring that was given to him by his wife.

255
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,420
He absolutely wouldn't do it.
He believes in keeping promises,

256
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:31,130
unlike everybody else in the
play, his daughter, you know,

257
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,040
everybody as we'll see. So, um,

258
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,150
so s another Lancelot says this,

259
00:15:38,151 --> 00:15:43,010
making of Christians will raise the
price of hogs. This, this Jewish girl,

260
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,660
Jessica,
has it become a Christian.

261
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:47,840
So now she's going to be able to eat
pork if it's going to increase the demand

262
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:51,710
for pork and therefore raise the
price of hogs. So Shakespeare,

263
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,220
the play is full of economics. It's
all about teaching economics. Okay.

264
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,880
So and so anyway,
they,

265
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,270
they go to the trial and a Shylock
thinks the guy's a complete fool.

266
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:06,800
He doesn't understand interest.

267
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:09,500
You don't understand the whole point
of a marriage contract. I mean,

268
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:12,710
not have a marriage contract of a
lending contract and getting interest.

269
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,340
And basically he says, I got to skip over
this little quickly. He says, you know,

270
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:21,090
I've, we've got a contract.
Your city, the greatest, uh,

271
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,490
commercial city in the world at that
time can't possibly survive if you don't

272
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:30,080
uphold contracts.
So if you deny me fine upon your law,

273
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,200
there is no force in the decrees
of Venice. I stand for judgment,

274
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:37,820
I stand for keeping promises. And the
law is supposed to enforce promises.

275
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,420
I stand for laws, which I liked,
says now that at the trial,

276
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,920
who turns out to be the judge,

277
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,510
will Porsche has disguised herself as
the judge and she's actually the judge.

278
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,440
And so she comes in and she has this
famous line who is the merchant here in

279
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:54,740
which is the Jew. So again, this
confirms to me it's about economics.

280
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:58,690
If she was about Judaism, it would be
who's the Christian and who's the Jewish.

281
00:16:58,691 --> 00:17:02,390
She saying, who's the borrower and who's
the lender? That's how she comes in.

282
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,590
And so then she says,

283
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:06,770
you've got to show mercy and this
is the most famous line in the play,

284
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:11,390
the quality of mercy, blah, blah. You all
remembered who seen it. And uh, he says,

285
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,050
um, and then, and then beside Neil
says, look, I've got 6,000 dockets.

286
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:19,550
I've got more than that. Take that. And he
says, you know, a contract is a contract.

287
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,640
You humiliated me. All kinds of
humiliations of happened to me.

288
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,970
I've got feelings too. I've been
humiliated. I want the contract.

289
00:17:25,971 --> 00:17:28,880
And the contract says that I
should get the pound of flesh.

290
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,500
And so besides Leo says, you know, to
do a great right, do a little wrong.

291
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:38,750
Okay. So, you know, deaf, you
know, let him default. And so, uh,

292
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,780
so what does Porsche say? What
is the judgment? It sounds she,

293
00:17:42,781 --> 00:17:44,000
she has to play the judge.

294
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:47,870
It seems like the whole city
depends on enforcing contracts.

295
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,890
And here it seems like
a horrible thing to do.

296
00:17:49,891 --> 00:17:53,700
You're going to have to kill somebody.
So what judgment can she possibly,

297
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,990
possibly mate? She says, well, the
state has to enforce contracts.

298
00:17:57,991 --> 00:18:00,210
Of course contracts have to be enforced,

299
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,420
but only good contracts
should be enforced.

300
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,520
And so what's wrong with the contract?

301
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:10,470
Does she say we're going to reduce
what you owe from 3000 to, you know,

302
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:14,970
1500? Does she, you know, that's
principal forgiveness. Does she say,

303
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:18,390
uh, just say you don't have to,
you know, what does she say?

304
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:23,460
What she says is that what was wrong
is the contract wasn't right. The Co,

305
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,710
it wasn't the interest
rate that was wrong.

306
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:27,330
It wasn't the amount
you owe that was wrong.

307
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:28,950
It was the collateral that was wrong.

308
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:34,100
So she says the right collateral was a
pound of flesh but not a drop of blood.

309
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,170
And so the state intervenes not
to change the interest rate,

310
00:18:37,171 --> 00:18:41,940
not to change the principal, but to
change the collateral. Okay. So, um,

311
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,030
all right. So that, that's going
to turn out to be, you know,

312
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:47,970
the leverage was wrong.
And so the second, okay.

313
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:51,990
So then the play ends with
Bizono asking the judge,

314
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:54,930
he's so pleased that things have turned
out right. If he can reward the judge,

315
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:57,000
he doesn't know who the judge
is. And he says, you know,

316
00:18:57,001 --> 00:19:00,240
I've got all these dockets that,
uh, I've just gotten, you know,

317
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:04,290
why don't I give you some of the dockets?
And the judge says, well, uh, no,

318
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,260
I don't want the dockets, but I notice
you've got this ring on your finger.

319
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,850
Why don't even give me that? And, uh,
you know, he says, well, I can't do that,

320
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:16,190
my Porsche's I've promised. And
the judge says, well, you know, um,

321
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:21,010
give it to me anyway. And he gives
her the ring. And so the play, uh,

322
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,930
finally ends with her revealing herself
and he's incredibly embarrassed that

323
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:28,830
he's given her the ring. So this is
another contract broken, another default,

324
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,920
and he, and then he says, but
I'm never going to default again.

325
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,260
And Antonio Steps in and says,
you know,

326
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,840
I'll guarantee again that
he'll never default again.

327
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,810
And of course we all know that
he's going to default. Okay.

328
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:44,870
So the whole play is just about contracts
and breaking contracts and figuring.

329
00:19:45,391 --> 00:19:47,610
So at first it's about what
the rate of interest should be.

330
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,420
Then it switches to should contracts
always be enforced and yes,

331
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:52,410
they should be enforced,

332
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,850
but the enforcement should be the taking
of collateral and sometimes the amount

333
00:19:56,851 --> 00:19:58,230
of collateral put up is Ron.

334
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,910
So that's going to be the conclusion of
this course that what went wrong in the

335
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:07,911
last two years or three years was a
horrible mistake about how much collateral

336
00:20:08,491 --> 00:20:12,090
to be put up and the Fed instead of
just monitoring the interest rate,

337
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:14,490
which is what you're taught in
macroeconomics, is supposed to do,

338
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,840
should it be monitoring
a collateral as well?

339
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:23,400
And maybe even most
importantly. So I'm now, okay.

340
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:26,640
So with that introduction
to the rest of the course,

341
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:30,440
I don't know how convinced you are about
Shakespeare, the economist, but hey,

342
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,800
let's now switch to um,
learning some,

343
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,600
some of the basic words of finance.
So,

344
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,600
okay.
So,

345
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:48,160
so I'm going to now follow pretty
closely what the notes are. Uh,

346
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,360
all right. So let's imagine a world
where we've solved for the equilibrium.

347
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,660
This could be the, you know, the
real world or in one of our models.

348
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,630
And there are many time periods,
not just two time periods.

349
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,930
So let's suppose that there as there are,

350
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:03,660
as we're going to see
in great detail later,

351
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:08,730
suppose it's possible to pay money today
in order to get a dollar next year or

352
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:12,310
pace in heart mountain of money today
in order to get a dollar in two years or

353
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:15,190
pay a different amount of money
today to get a dollar in three years.

354
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:19,480
So Pi Ti is the amount of money you
paid today to get a dollar at time.

355
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:24,070
T that's called a zero
because there's no coupon.

356
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:28,630
You just get something at the end. And so
though you'll, we'll see you next class.

357
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,201
You know,

358
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:32,500
we're going to start talking about real
real markets and what the prices of all

359
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:33,810
the Zeros are.
So anyway,

360
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,930
that Thai tea is something that is traded
in the market and everybody at every

361
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:42,760
hedge fund and every Wall Street Bank
knows what Pi t is at the beginning of

362
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,310
each day. Now Fisher said, well
don't get too lost thinking about Pi.

363
00:21:46,311 --> 00:21:49,960
Ti think about PT, you
know, take out inflation.

364
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,810
You don't have to make an
expectation about what inflation is,

365
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,800
but assuming you're right,

366
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:58,570
you can figure out from these Pi teas
what PT is the present value price,

367
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:02,860
how much would you pay today and
goods to get an apple at time.

368
00:22:02,861 --> 00:22:05,380
T not a dollar at time t
but an apple at time t.

369
00:22:05,381 --> 00:22:08,150
So it involves knowing what inflation
is and what the price of apples is going

370
00:22:08,151 --> 00:22:12,790
to be a tight time t. So Fisher said
there's a lot of stuff you can do,

371
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:13,990
but the Pi teas,

372
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,650
there's also more important stuff you
can do with the pts and you should always

373
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:21,430
keep those in mind. Okay. So, um,

374
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,940
let's take the simplest case where
piety is a constant interest rates.

375
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:32,440
There's a constant interest
rate. I, so if you ask, um,

376
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,670
what's a dollar worth today in terms of
how many dollars you can get next year?

377
00:22:36,671 --> 00:22:40,120
It's one plus I, what's a dollar
worth today? In two years?

378
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:43,990
It's one plus ice squared. So putting
it backwards, a dollar in two years,

379
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,140
the price of it today,
it must be one over one plus I squared.

380
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:50,710
So a dollar in tears.
The value today is one plus I over t.

381
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:52,570
So this is just a simplification.
So,

382
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:57,460
so we'll see that lots of the jargon
of economics assumes that there's this

383
00:22:57,461 --> 00:23:02,050
constant interest rate. Uh, that's,
that's determining all these prices.

384
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,700
Okay.
So

385
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:10,150
the first thing to realize is what
Fisher calls the present value price.

386
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:15,180
If there are some acid that paid off
money in the future and one through empty,

387
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,930
you don't have to solve the
whole equilibrium to figure
out what its price would

388
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:22,570
be if you knew the prices of these Zeros.

389
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:27,690
Pi one through Pi Ti because to get em
$2 a time to just costs you Pi $2 today.

390
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,950
So you add up the cost of buying
all the cashflows of the acid.

391
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,560
That has to be the price
of the asset today.

392
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,860
And if the prices of the Zeros are given
just by the interest rate discounting

393
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,040
it, then uh, then it's just,

394
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:47,360
and one of one plus I and to over one I
squared and empty over one plus r to the

395
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:52,650
T. I see there's a typo here. Oh No,

396
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,880
no, there's no type of,
it's one plus side of the t.

397
00:23:54,881 --> 00:23:58,580
There are all these one
beside of the tea. Okay, so,

398
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,230
and now if the price weren't that,
if the price of this bond, we're,

399
00:24:03,231 --> 00:24:07,490
we're bigger, we're let's say smaller
than this, uh, what would you do?

400
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,520
You would buy the bond and at the same
time you'd sell promises to deliver m one

401
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,260
m two and empty in the future.

402
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,430
If you sold those promises and nobody
doubted that you would keep your promise.

403
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,880
So this is something you know
Shakespeare wouldn't have,

404
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:27,020
would have been suspicious of. But if you
made those promises and no one doubted,

405
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:27,854
you'd keep them.

406
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,920
You could raise this much money by selling
all the promises so you get this much

407
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:37,640
money. If the bond costs less than
that, you could make all the promises,

408
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:41,360
get all the money, buy the
bond, have money leftover. Okay.

409
00:24:41,361 --> 00:24:43,040
Then you'd have to keep all your promises.

410
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,940
But the bond itself would be paying you
money in the future that you could use

411
00:24:46,941 --> 00:24:48,260
to keep all your promises.

412
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,440
So it has to be that this is the price
of the bond provided that everybody will

413
00:24:53,781 --> 00:24:57,260
allow you to borrow and lend at those
rates of interest. Because if it weren't,

414
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,990
you would either buy the bond
and sell all the promises.

415
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:04,220
Or in the other case where the price
is higher, you'd sell the bond. Okay,

416
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,730
get all this money and
then, um, by all the,

417
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,540
use that money to buy all those promises.
Okay.

418
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:14,290
And then you could keep the promise,
then you could keep [inaudible].

419
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,450
You could make the payments of the bond
because the promises would come due to

420
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:18,770
you. So if you, in that case,

421
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:21,650
you'd have to believe people
who made promises to you.

422
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,700
So as long as nobody's doubting the
other people keeping their promises,

423
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,590
it has to be that by no arbitrage,

424
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:30,590
the price of a bond is just
the discounted cash flows.

425
00:25:30,591 --> 00:25:34,580
That was Fisher's main principle.
Okay. So he saw that last time.

426
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:36,260
We're just going to do it. Uh, okay.

427
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,010
So we're now going to
introduce a few vocabulary.

428
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:42,290
So the first thing is the doubling rule.

429
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,170
So I think at least half
of you probably know this,

430
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:49,130
but you know it's a much better if you
can do things in your head than having to

431
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,420
calculate them all.

432
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:55,610
So the doubling rule says how many years
that I percent interest does it take to

433
00:25:55,611 --> 00:26:00,200
double your money? So, um,
so you can just solve this.

434
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,041
Okay,

435
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:06,041
so one plus I to the end means that if
you take the logs of both sides and you

436
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:11,531
know that log of two is 0.69
then a 0.6 then then you know,

437
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:15,860
you take the log of both sides and
log one plus cy has to be log of two.

438
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:20,120
So anti equals 0.69 over
log of one plus Ai. Okay.

439
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:25,121
And so now log of one plus cy
you know is approximately I,

440
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,110
why is that?
So this is Taylor's really,

441
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:32,480
you don't actually have to know this if
you've never seen Taylor's rule before

442
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,920
but you know an approximation
of log of one plus Ai.

443
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,690
You know for any function f of x,

444
00:26:38,691 --> 00:26:43,320
it's FFA plus f prime of a times x minus
eight plus one half f double prime of

445
00:26:43,321 --> 00:26:46,350
eight times x minus h squared.
That's the standard Taylor's rule thing.

446
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:51,560
So therefore log of one plus I is log
of one and zero so it's going to be zero

447
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:57,710
plus I cause the derivative of the log
is one over x and that x equals one

448
00:26:57,811 --> 00:26:58,710
that's one of her one.

449
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:03,840
So it's zero plus I and then the second
derivative is minus one over x squared

450
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:07,830
and x equals one that's minus one.
So with the half here,

451
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,810
the approximate log,
one plus size,

452
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:14,811
approximately zero plus PSI minus ice
squared over two so you can replace log of

453
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:18,180
one plus Psi with,

454
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:24,060
I mean 0.69 of her log of one plus the
eye with 0.69 over I'm minus I squared

455
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:27,150
over two so you know,

456
00:27:27,151 --> 00:27:30,810
for very small interest rates I
squared is practically nothing.

457
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,330
So 0.69 over I,
you know,

458
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:38,331
if the interest rate is a is a 0.0 to
3% 0.0 to three that times and 0.69

459
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:47,810
divided by 0.023 is 30 so it
says that in at 2.3% interest,

460
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,410
you double your money in 30 years.
Well,

461
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:57,650
if I is 7% say the Nice Square to
starting to get a little bit bigger.

462
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:04,910
So I minus iceberg spirit over to his
0.07 I squared 0.049 over two that's

463
00:28:06,481 --> 00:28:11,481
0.0675 so if I put in I ankles 0.07 it's
0.69 of her 0.0675 that's around right.

464
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,080
69 over 67 you know
there's a decimal things.

465
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:24,081
It's a little over 10 say 10.2 that's
like 0.7 to over 0.07 so that's 0.72 is

466
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:31,521
the doubling rule to get for interest
rates around 7% or 6% or 4% something like

467
00:28:32,641 --> 00:28:33,300
that.

468
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:37,890
You know you're going to divide 90 to
69 but in [inaudible] 72 so 72 you know

469
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:41,860
the interest rate is 0.07 right?
Interest rate is a percent so it's,

470
00:28:41,861 --> 00:28:42,960
it's a decimal thing.
So,

471
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:48,260
so 0.07 or 0.06 is like 72 over six so
at 6% it takes 12 years to double your

472
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,590
money.
So the rule,

473
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:56,610
the basic rule is he want to know how
long it takes at 6% interest to double

474
00:28:56,761 --> 00:29:00,750
your money. You just take 72
divided by six and it's 12 years.

475
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,500
If it's 8% interest, 72 over eight is
about nine years. If it's a, you know,

476
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:10,380
10% interest, it's a little over seven
years to double your money. Okay?

477
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:15,000
And so that rule is incredibly useful
to keep in your head because you can do

478
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:15,181
all,

479
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:20,181
you can shock and amaze people by how
fast you can compute things that you know,

480
00:29:20,491 --> 00:29:24,840
if you just remember that rule. So let's
just check the rule by the way. Um,

481
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:32,450
so suppose that you
have a $24 in the bank,

482
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,610
okay?
And you have 6% interest.

483
00:29:35,611 --> 00:29:39,060
So here I took the $24
you look at the top,

484
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:41,070
you see that's the B one number,

485
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:45,160
and I've just multiplied it by
the interest rate 1.06 okay.

486
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:46,900
And so I keep doing that.
You know,

487
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:50,080
here I've multiplied the
thing above it by 1.06 again.

488
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:53,470
So I keep investing the money
at 6% interest over here,

489
00:29:53,471 --> 00:29:57,070
I've invested the money at
7% interest. Okay? So anyway,

490
00:29:57,071 --> 00:30:01,990
after 12 years you see the $24 you know,

491
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,430
this is year one.

492
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:08,580
So at year 1220 $4 has become 48
so it's a very good approximation.

493
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:15,190
And so 7% you know, it's supposed to
take a little over 10 years. So 10 years,

494
00:30:15,191 --> 00:30:17,690
you're not quite there,
but 11 years you're past it.

495
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,590
You can see how we're starting with 24.

496
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:25,690
You can see how good the doubling rule is.
Okay? So that's just something to keep.

497
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,550
So we can now do in class lots of concrete
examples without having to take out

498
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:34,600
our calculators and stuff cause we can
do them in class in your head. All right,

499
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:37,990
so that's, so let's just do that now. Um,

500
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,773
okay.

501
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:49,210
Okay. So in fact, why
did I pick $24? Well,

502
00:30:49,211 --> 00:30:53,710
this is a famous story you hear
in second grade, the Indians, uh,

503
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:58,510
sold Manhattan for $24 in 1646.

504
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,800
So how bad a deal was that for the
Indians? It looks incredibly stupid,

505
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:06,520
but actually, you know, interest
accumulates pretty fast.

506
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,130
So if you look at 6% interest,
okay,

507
00:31:09,131 --> 00:31:13,570
so 360 years gets you to 2006.

508
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:16,660
That's a sort of round number at 6%.

509
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:20,680
So at 6% how long does it take to double?
It takes 12 years to double.

510
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:24,550
So that means at 6% interest,
you're doubling every 12 years.

511
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:28,840
So in 360 years,
you're going to double 30 times.

512
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:33,790
So in your head you can figure
out that doubling every 30 times,

513
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,211
you know,

514
00:31:34,211 --> 00:31:38,020
doubling 30 times as two to the 30th and
of course two to the 10th is something

515
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,150
you should know.
It's 1024 you know,

516
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:44,380
so I'm sure you know that
number right to, to the, okay,

517
00:31:44,381 --> 00:31:45,970
so it's one family that's
a good one to remember.

518
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:50,530
Two to the 10th is about a thousand so
a thousand cubed is about a billion.

519
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,880
So basically 24 becomes 24 billion.
So at 6% interest,

520
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:59,110
and they sold Manhattan for 24
billion in today's dollars. So that's,

521
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:03,370
that's pitifully low.
But if you look at 7% interest,

522
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:06,760
you can do the same calculation.
So it's 7% interest.

523
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:07,870
You should do this in your head now.

524
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:11,380
So it's going to double
every 72 over seven years.

525
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:16,120
So their 360 years,
about 360 is very round number.

526
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:21,210
So three 360 divided by 72 over
seven that's five times seven.

527
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:22,660
It's 35,

528
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:27,870
so two to the 35th while it's like
a billion times two to the fifth,

529
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,860
which is 32.
So it's a $1 becomes 32 billion,

530
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:37,090
but we started with $24.
So it's 768 billion.

531
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,480
So now you're starting to get a
little bit closer to what, um,

532
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,010
the value of Manhattan is.
I mean,

533
00:32:43,011 --> 00:32:45,590
the value of all the real
estate in the country,

534
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,910
all the houses in the country used to
be 20 trillion and not sure how far

535
00:32:49,911 --> 00:32:54,680
they've gone down. Now let's say
they're 15 trillion. Um, so 15 trillion.

536
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,960
You add commercial real estate,
you know,

537
00:32:56,961 --> 00:33:01,961
maybe in the whole country
that's worth 25 trillion or 22.

538
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,250
But that went down too.
So let's say 20 trillion now,

539
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:07,040
how much of the 20 Chilean could
possibly be in New York City?

540
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:10,430
I've actually got no idea, but it
can't be that much more. You know,

541
00:33:10,431 --> 00:33:11,960
the whole country is 20 trillion.

542
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:16,400
New York can't be worth much more than
one or 2 trillion of the 20 trillion. So,

543
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:20,000
you know, you're not that far off. So
the deal's not that spectacularly bad,

544
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:21,350
although it sounds ridiculous.
Anyway,

545
00:33:21,351 --> 00:33:24,740
the point is you can do this in
your head and we can, uh, okay.

546
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,120
So now the next thing that you realize
in this example is how huge a difference

547
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:35,390
a percent makes. So why is
that so important? Well,

548
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:39,500
managers, hedge funds, we all
charge a percent interest.

549
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:44,540
So look at what's happening. I
mean, if you look at our Indian,

550
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,840
you know,
investment of 24 and you look,

551
00:33:47,841 --> 00:33:50,510
I don't know how many years you want
to look over it, but you can look over,

552
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,120
you know, 36 years.
That's a sort of typical,

553
00:33:53,121 --> 00:33:56,790
you're young making an investment
when you get old. What's the, um,

554
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,090
you know,
what's the,

555
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,230
what's the difference?
This was sick.

556
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:08,000
This was the 6% growth and this was
the 7% growth. This is the difference.

557
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,360
And this is the,
I guess the percentage difference.

558
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,250
So it's 28%.

559
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,950
Uh,

560
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,670
of course they didn't label these,
but uh,

561
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,113
okay.

562
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,370
Yeah. So this is the, this is the,

563
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,590
this is the difference and
this is the percent difference.

564
00:34:29,591 --> 00:34:34,570
So the percent difference. Okay. So that
why just showed it to you over 36 years.

565
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:39,670
It's, um, 28.6% difference.
So a typical, you know,

566
00:34:39,671 --> 00:34:42,670
you're putting money away right now,
you might be giving it to some fun.

567
00:34:42,671 --> 00:34:46,870
You might be investing it in
your, you know, your, you know,

568
00:34:46,871 --> 00:34:48,160
whatever fund you're investing in it,

569
00:34:48,161 --> 00:34:52,720
they could be charging 1% interest and it
seems, what's 1%? It's a tiny amount. 1%,

570
00:34:52,721 --> 00:34:56,680
you know, but over 30 years,
they're taking 28% of your money.

571
00:34:56,681 --> 00:35:00,370
36 years with the Indians over 360 years.

572
00:35:00,371 --> 00:35:02,770
We saw that it was an astronomical
amount that they took.

573
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,350
They took almost all your
money, right? So, I mean,

574
00:35:05,351 --> 00:35:07,720
look at the percentage that got taken.

575
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:11,620
So 768 billion versus

576
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,950
um,
uh,

577
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,220
versus 24 billion. I mean,
what could be, I mean,

578
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,750
it's astounding.
Okay.

579
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:25,460
So giving 1% away to a money
manager is giving away a fortune.

580
00:35:25,461 --> 00:35:27,920
If you think you're going to stick
with the money manager for a reasonable

581
00:35:27,921 --> 00:35:31,040
amount of time. So if you want the
secret to how hedge funds make money,

582
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,640
that's the first way they make it. The
most important way. They charge a fee.

583
00:35:34,641 --> 00:35:35,780
That sounds small,

584
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,390
but it adds up over a years and it
amounts to a huge amount of money.

585
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:43,290
Now you can make it much smart.
Why does it amount to so much money?

586
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,740
Because the money that you put in
the fund you're keeping in the fund.

587
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:48,240
So it's growing and growing and growing.

588
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:52,080
So they're taking 1% of your hundred
$24 today. That sounds like nothing.

589
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,960
But the money's still there
and now 40 years later,

590
00:35:54,961 --> 00:35:57,240
they're taking 1% of a much bigger number.

591
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,150
That's why the number gets to be so large.
Okay,

592
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:05,340
so that's the second thing. All
right, so now let's keep going.

593
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,170
So that's the basic a thing.

594
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,770
So now let's go to define a few
terms that everybody should know.

595
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:12,330
What's a coupon bond?

596
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,780
A coupon bond is the
simplest kind of bond.

597
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:20,781
The first one that was created and it
pays a fixed coupon dollars every period

598
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:26,610
for t periods. The t's called the
maturity. So it's defined by the coupon,

599
00:36:26,611 --> 00:36:30,000
which is the fixed payment it
makes every year until period t,

600
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,890
which is the maturity of the bond.

601
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:36,360
And then it also at the end of
period t pays a principal. Okay.

602
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,860
Which is um, so here, which is usually a,

603
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,460
how the bond is a denominated,

604
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,000
I'm the face value of the bond and
pays the principal or face value.

605
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:47,310
So typically that's usually
a hundred or a thousand.

606
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:52,140
So a coupon might be a six, six, six, six,

607
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:56,580
106. Okay. That would be a
6% coupon bond. You know,

608
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,610
you can also define the coupon
by the percentage of the,

609
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:03,780
of the face that it pays every year as
a coupon. So little c is the percentage.

610
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:08,430
So 0.06, uh, times a hundred is
six, six, six, six, six, six.

611
00:37:08,431 --> 00:37:11,760
I can use B s, you
know, big C is $6. Okay.

612
00:37:11,761 --> 00:37:16,470
So it's defined by its percentage,
by the face and by the maturity.

613
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,800
So the first obvious thing to say is if
the interest rate is 6% and the bond is

614
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:28,701
paying a 6% coupon than it
has to be worth its face.

615
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,600
So it's always assume the faces a
hundred so why is that? Because if a,

616
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,230
okay, so why is that? It doesn't seem
totally obvious because you know you're,

617
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,930
the formula is you take a hundred times.

618
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,670
See that's the first payment divided
by one plus AI than a hundred times c

619
00:37:44,671 --> 00:37:46,770
divided by one plus r squared,
et cetera.

620
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:50,370
It's not so obvious that's going to turn
out to be equal to a hundred but so you

621
00:37:50,371 --> 00:37:53,670
just have to think for a second why that
should be in the way to think of this

622
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:56,490
as if you had $100 in
the bank at 6% interest,

623
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,940
you could get $106 the next year,

624
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,310
take the six and throw it and spend it.

625
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:05,280
You'd still have $100 in the bank
that would give you $6 again,

626
00:38:05,281 --> 00:38:07,440
the next year you could take that $6 in,
spend it,

627
00:38:07,441 --> 00:38:08,940
you'd still have $100 in the bank.

628
00:38:08,941 --> 00:38:13,941
And You keep doing that until the last
year when you've got $106 so at 6%

629
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:18,180
interest putting the money in the
bank and spending the coupons,

630
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:22,680
we'd give you exactly the same cash flow
as the bonds giving you. So therefore,

631
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:26,840
uh, whether you put the money at
the bank at 6% interest or keep or,

632
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:29,010
or by the bond,
you're getting the same cash flow.

633
00:38:29,011 --> 00:38:32,340
So it has to be by no arbitrage that
the initial outlay was the same.

634
00:38:32,341 --> 00:38:37,270
So it has to be $100.
Okay, well that obvious,

635
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,120
okay?
Now you can prove it many different ways.

636
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:45,121
Now you could also imagine keeping
a bond forever paying 6% interest.

637
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:50,380
Then you get, if $100 a 6%
interest would give you $6 forever.

638
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:55,180
So if there were 6% interest
and you're getting $12 forever,

639
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,050
how much would that be worth
at? 6% interest. $12 forever.

640
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:01,690
Okay,

641
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:05,110
6% interest and you get $12
every year forever. What's that?

642
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,310
Okay,

643
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,290
how many dollars is that worth originally?

644
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,420
If the interest rate that all banks are
giving and the whole world's agreeing 6%

645
00:39:14,421 --> 00:39:18,170
is the rate of interest and someone's
offering to give you $12 every year

646
00:39:18,171 --> 00:39:22,730
forever. How much money into present
value terms is it giving you?

647
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,360
Yeah,

648
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:28,920
200 right? Because 200 at 6%
would give you $12 every year.

649
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:33,960
Okay. So these are the most basic
formulas to keep in mind. Okay.

650
00:39:33,961 --> 00:39:38,910
So those, you know, you may be hearing
these things for the first time.

651
00:39:38,911 --> 00:39:41,130
So it, it's, it takes a
second to adjust to it,

652
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:44,910
but there's no cleverness involved
in figuring these out. Now what's,

653
00:39:44,911 --> 00:39:47,310
so we've got,
we've got the doubling rule,

654
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:51,720
we've got a coupon bonds and now,

655
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:56,220
so that's simple. Now somewhat
subtler thing is an annuity. Okay?

656
00:39:56,221 --> 00:40:01,221
So an annuity pays you a fixed
amount for a fixed number of years.

657
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,700
So it doesn't pay the principal
at the end. So pays that.

658
00:40:05,701 --> 00:40:08,420
C is supposed to be a
capital city and pay C, c, c,

659
00:40:08,421 --> 00:40:12,120
C for a fixed number of years.

660
00:40:12,121 --> 00:40:14,190
So it's a t period annuity.

661
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:19,140
Now annuities also can be
changed in two important ways.

662
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:23,940
They can be indexed to inflation. That's
a much better annuity. Cause now you're,

663
00:40:23,941 --> 00:40:28,290
you're, you're, you're, you're, you
know, you're protected against inflation.

664
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:31,230
It also could be time to
last the rest of your life.

665
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,930
So we're going to come to this
when we talk about social security,

666
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:38,460
the most important annuity by far and
the whole economy is the social security

667
00:40:38,461 --> 00:40:42,570
annuity. Once you retire and
you're in social security,

668
00:40:42,571 --> 00:40:45,780
they figure out what your coop,
what your coupon is going to be.

669
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:49,440
Every year it's you, I'll tell you
the formula and a couple of classes.

670
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,210
So depending on how
much you've contributed,

671
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:53,700
they calculate what your
coupon is every year.

672
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:58,560
And so from the day you turn 65 for the
rest of your life, you get the same,

673
00:40:58,561 --> 00:41:00,270
see inflation corrected.

674
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,210
So we're going to have to talk about
why they decided on that contract.

675
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:07,830
But anyway, that's an annuity. So
that depends on the length of life.

676
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,270
Okay. So you know, these annuities
are famous in history, Jane Austen,

677
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,420
the sense and sensibility said
it was a disaster. You know,

678
00:41:15,421 --> 00:41:18,480
because whenever you give someone
an annuity, they live forever.

679
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,880
And she said that,
you know,

680
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:24,540
some character says her mother gave
the servants in the houses, uh,

681
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:29,310
annuities after their, you know,
their husbands died. And, uh,

682
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:32,670
she figured that they were so
old. Now, she gave the annuities,

683
00:41:32,671 --> 00:41:36,290
they were servants of her mother's and
she gave them the annuity after their

684
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:39,050
husbands died. And, uh, you
know, Allison say we're so old.

685
00:41:39,051 --> 00:41:41,600
She figured if she paid him a few
years and that'd be the end of it.

686
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,390
And they just went on and on and on
and on, and it was just, you know,

687
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:47,210
she got tired of giving them
all the money. But anyway,

688
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,550
so obviously when you're
giving a life annuity,

689
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:52,310
you have to calculate how long
the person's going to live.

690
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,280
And so we're going to come back to
that. The selection of, you know,

691
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,070
who takes annuities? Do they know that
they're going to live longer or not?

692
00:41:58,071 --> 00:42:00,680
Anyway, that markets all screwed up
and we're going to come to that later.

693
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,260
But it's a famous market,
the annuity market. Now,

694
00:42:03,261 --> 00:42:07,760
how can you figure out the
value of an annuity? Okay,

695
00:42:07,761 --> 00:42:11,570
so this is a very simple
thing to do. Uh, once you've,

696
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,010
once you've come this far,
so this is the next thing to remember.

697
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,640
So I remember an annuities paying c, c, C,

698
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,320
c up to period t
here,

699
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:25,880
the periods t.
Okay,

700
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:28,640
so how much should this be
worth the present value?

701
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:35,150
What is the present value
today at time zero? Well,

702
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,700
we know that if it actually went forever,
see,

703
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,800
see like that it would be forever.

704
00:42:42,801 --> 00:42:45,470
It would go see over the interest rate.

705
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:48,860
I annuities are often inflation correct.

706
00:42:48,861 --> 00:42:51,290
And so I wrote are for
the real rate of interest.

707
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,050
So you could call it c over r
for the wheel rate of whatever.

708
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:56,540
Let's say it's nominal.
It's keep it too. I,

709
00:42:56,541 --> 00:43:00,130
even though I haven't used that
notation there, so see you ever I,

710
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:03,800
if you get see dollars forever,
it's called a perpetuity.

711
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:09,290
A perpetuity. We already
know how to value. Okay.

712
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:13,160
We said see over I right at
6% for getting $12 a year.

713
00:43:13,161 --> 00:43:16,880
It's worth $200.
Now what if it gets cut off at t?

714
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:20,150
Sounds like there's going to be a
very complicated formula to calculate,

715
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:23,930
but actually it's a very simple
formula. Okay. Why is that?

716
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,540
Because the t period,
so there,

717
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:31,220
here's the perpetuity
and the t period annuity

718
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:37,840
equals the perpetuity

719
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:45,090
minus a per perpetuity starting at time.

720
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:47,370
T minus perpetuity,

721
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:54,030
uh, uh, contracted

722
00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:00,250
at time. T. All right,

723
00:44:00,251 --> 00:44:05,230
so why, why is that? Here we
have a perpetuity at time.
Zero. You say to someone,

724
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,310
I'll,
you know the state,

725
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:10,330
the government says we'll pay you and
your descendants see dollars forever.

726
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,160
Okay, now you can. So we know what
that's worth. See override. Now we say,

727
00:44:15,161 --> 00:44:17,260
suppose the state tells
you we're going to pay.

728
00:44:17,261 --> 00:44:21,520
You see until time t what's that
worth? Well, it's worth this,

729
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,370
the whole thing minus this part of it,

730
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:27,100
but looked at from this
point of view here,

731
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,230
the whole part of it is
just a perpetuity again.

732
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:34,890
So it's just the perpetuity
which is see over I

733
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,680
minus c overall high,
another perpetuity here.

734
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,370
But as of time t cause that's, you
know, that's like the zero time.

735
00:44:44,371 --> 00:44:47,700
The money's coming the next period
forever. Just like at time zero,

736
00:44:47,701 --> 00:44:50,490
the money came starting up here
at one forever. So at time tier,

737
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,400
starting one period later forever.

738
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,520
So therefore it's this divided
by one plus r to the T.

739
00:44:59,730 --> 00:44:59,941
Okay?

740
00:44:59,941 --> 00:45:04,941
So let's just see over I times one
minus one over one plus r to the t.

741
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:11,010
So this is the next thing you
have to memorize, unfortunately,

742
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:12,810
but there are only a few
things you have to memorize.

743
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:17,550
So this is a very famous formula
for the value of an annuity. Okay?

744
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:20,910
So how do you, uh, okay,

745
00:45:20,911 --> 00:45:25,770
so let's just do an example.
Suppose somebody,

746
00:45:25,771 --> 00:45:30,270
maybe I can just do the same examples.
Okay, so you got the proof of that, right?

747
00:45:30,271 --> 00:45:33,240
This is no surprise.

748
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:41,010
Okay? Remember the whole perpetuity is
obviously it's 6% and let's just think of

749
00:45:41,011 --> 00:45:42,360
something at 6%.

750
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,960
So let's do the 6% annuity at
6% it's worth a 6% perpetuity.

751
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,740
$6, sorry, sick. Um, what am I saying?

752
00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:00,990
A at 6% interest,
6% interest,

753
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:08,940
eight $12 perpetuity

754
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:16,540
is worth $200.
That was what we said before.

755
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:18,100
Okay,

756
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:22,870
so what is a 36 year?

757
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,720
Okay,
so at 6% interest,

758
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:30,790
$12 perpetuity is worth $200.
So at 6% interest,

759
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:35,290
what is a $12 30 year?

760
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:42,280
Your annuity worth?
It's worth what?

761
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,580
It's all you.
That's how much is that worth?

762
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,130
Okay.
So if it went on forever,

763
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:58,300
it would be worth $200
if we cut it off after

764
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,040
30 years,

765
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:12,050
30 years is a bad time to cut it
off. Let's cut it off after. Um,

766
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:17,110
let's cut it off after 24 years.

767
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,670
Okay.
So you have 6% interest,

768
00:47:23,671 --> 00:47:28,080
you get $12 not for every year
in the future, but for 24 years.

769
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,350
How much is it worth?

770
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:33,550
What can't be worth $200 cause
it'd be worth $200 for one forever.

771
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:38,740
So it's worth less than $200 but
how much less? So my uncle died,

772
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:43,660
left my sister and annuity. She just
had no idea what the annuity was, uh,

773
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:49,340
was worth. So do you have
any idea what it's worth?

774
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:54,270
Yup. Okay. It is. And
how did you get that?

775
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:01,030
It's 6% doubling your money. Yup.

776
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:04,263
Yup.

777
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,930
So it's one minus a quarter.

778
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:14,170
So that's three quarters and three
quarters times the 200 we got before.

779
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:19,310
It's 150 exactly. Exactly right. What
he said. So does everybody get that?

780
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:24,560
So let's say we have a,
let's try another one. Okay.

781
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:29,010
So let's suppose
I tell you,

782
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:30,623
um,

783
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,760
so let's suppose I pay $8.

784
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,520
See how long is this going to be?

785
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,313
Okay.

786
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:52,750
Okay. Suppose let's do, let's make
the, okay, let me say that again,

787
00:48:52,751 --> 00:48:54,400
just in case you didn't follow that.

788
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:57,100
Cause I'm going to give a slightly
harder one this time. So he's saying,

789
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,870
how do you figure out
the value of an annuity?

790
00:48:58,871 --> 00:49:01,900
Something by next class you'll
be able to do in your head,

791
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:05,320
it's going to be take the cash
flow that you get every year.

792
00:49:05,321 --> 00:49:08,560
If it went on forever, it'd be so
easy to figure out what the value was.

793
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:10,900
If it's $12 at 6% interest,

794
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:14,380
that's like having $200 in the bank
because then you'd get at 6% interest.

795
00:49:14,381 --> 00:49:16,900
You going to get $12 every year forever.
Okay?

796
00:49:16,901 --> 00:49:21,901
So we know of that $12 a year forever is
clearly $200 that's see over I 12 of a

797
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:25,810
0.06 it's $200 blog.

798
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:30,130
It's going to get cut off when you are
24 so we're going to lose all this future

799
00:49:30,131 --> 00:49:34,540
stuff. But the future is not worth very
much. Why isn't it worth worth very much?

800
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:37,900
Cause you know by the time we get here,
we've already discounted by a lot.

801
00:49:37,901 --> 00:49:42,880
So a dollar starting here is actually
only a quarter of a dollar starting back

802
00:49:42,881 --> 00:49:46,510
here because in 24 years at 6% interest,
you've doubled twice.

803
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:50,380
So it's worth a quarter. So you just
take a quarter of the same annuity.

804
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,060
So it's one minus,

805
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:56,380
it's it's a one minus a
quarter of the same annuity.

806
00:49:56,381 --> 00:50:00,010
So the one that ends in 24 years is
like three quarters of the value of a

807
00:50:00,011 --> 00:50:04,330
perpetuity. Three quarters of 200
is 150 okay. That's how we did it.

808
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:07,480
So let's just try a slightly,
let's reverse the thing.

809
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,390
Suppose we know the
present value is a hundred.

810
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:15,550
Suppose we know the present value is a
hundred you're now the company and you're

811
00:50:15,551 --> 00:50:19,900
trying to figure out how much to pay.
Okay. So what is the SI going to be?

812
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:24,280
Let's say it's 8% interest.
Okay.

813
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:28,610
And just to, I'll just do the
same example in notes. Okay.

814
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:32,660
And the 30 years a typical thing. So it's
not going to work out exactly evenly.

815
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:36,080
So 8% interest for 30 years.

816
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:42,900
Okay?
So we know it's worth a hundred

817
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:49,380
all right? So let's get rid
of all me enrolled in stuff.

818
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:54,030
You don't have to board cluttered.
We've got something that's worth a hundred

819
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,193
okay,

820
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:00,760
here's the formula down here.
So the thing is worth a hundred

821
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:07,290
you know the interest rate is 8%
now and it's a 30 year annuity.

822
00:51:07,361 --> 00:51:10,930
So somebody tells you the interest rate's
8% these days you're going to get a 30

823
00:51:10,931 --> 00:51:14,410
year annuity, you've got $100 to invest,
and you go to the annuities company,

824
00:51:14,411 --> 00:51:17,380
the insurance company,
you tell them I want an annuity.

825
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,820
How much did they give you every year
while you just have to figure out what C

826
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:23,980
is.
So you put c over 0.08

827
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:30,150
okay. So what does that tell
you? What would that be?

828
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:35,720
If it was a, what would they be
paying you? If it was a perpetuity,

829
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,593
they'd be,

830
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:47,490
you'd be paying you who's a perpetuity,
what would they be paying you?

831
00:51:47,491 --> 00:51:49,650
They'd be paying $8 a year. Right? So,

832
00:51:49,651 --> 00:51:52,200
but they're only going to
pay you for 30 for 30 years.

833
00:51:52,201 --> 00:51:56,100
So how much are they going to pay
you? One plus I to the T. Okay,

834
00:51:56,101 --> 00:52:01,101
so this is 1.08 1.08 to the 30th and
what's 1.08 to the 30th well 1.08 to the

835
00:52:06,151 --> 00:52:08,280
30th by our rule is what?

836
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:13,580
It's equal to 1.08 to the 27th hey and
in nine years at 8% interest all doubles

837
00:52:15,391 --> 00:52:18,720
after 27 years it's going
to double three times.

838
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:24,300
One point also oh eight
to the third power.

839
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:27,840
So after 27 years is going
to double or three times.

840
00:52:27,841 --> 00:52:32,841
So that's eight by two to the third power
is eight and then 8% over three years.

841
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:39,630
[inaudible] eight ghost one oh eight
goes to about one 16 goes to about one 24

842
00:52:39,631 --> 00:52:42,150
but you know it's going to grow
a little faster because you know,

843
00:52:42,151 --> 00:52:47,151
1.08 times 1.08 is a little bit more
than 1.16 so it's going to grow to like

844
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:52,830
1.25 instead of 1.24.
So that's 10.

845
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:57,540
Okay?
So this is just one over 10.

846
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:01,920
So the whole thing is nine
tenths. So basically, uh,

847
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:06,330
you get almost all the value after third,
after 30 years at 8% interest.

848
00:53:06,331 --> 00:53:10,800
It's such a high interest rate that
after 30 years you're getting nine tenths

849
00:53:10,801 --> 00:53:13,560
and the value of the annuity,
okay,

850
00:53:13,561 --> 00:53:18,370
so you're going to have to get
paid 10 nines. The uh, you know,

851
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,600
$8,000 it would have been $8,000.
If we're perpetuity,

852
00:53:21,601 --> 00:53:23,310
you have to pay the guy a little bit more.

853
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:26,460
You have to get a little bit more
because only getting it for 30 years.

854
00:53:26,461 --> 00:53:28,140
But because the interest rate's so high,

855
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:31,950
the stuff after 30 years isn't very
important. It's only, uh, you know,

856
00:53:31,951 --> 00:53:35,670
you have to be given an extra 10th.
So it's 10, nine signs, 8,000.

857
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:40,671
So it's 8,888 is what you are
annuity's is going to be every year.

858
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,240
Okay. So just to summarize
it, to say it all again,

859
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,620
we know how to compute
perpetuities with ease.

860
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,630
And so if you want $100 and a coupon
forever and the interest rate's 8%,

861
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:57,840
there's just 8,000 forever. If you only
get it for a shorter amount of time,

862
00:53:57,841 --> 00:54:00,540
obviously you have to get more.
How much more?

863
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:03,120
What depends each year for only 30 years.

864
00:54:03,121 --> 00:54:04,980
It depends on how much
you're giving up at the end.

865
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:09,840
And at 8% you're only giving
up a 10th of the whole value.

866
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:13,450
So you have to be compensated for that
each year by getting 10, you know,

867
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,120
mine's of what you would've gotten before.

868
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:19,050
So we're up to 8,888 okay.

869
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:24,660
All right. So that's okay.
So those are all right.

870
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:27,360
So those are the words
that everybody has to know.

871
00:54:27,361 --> 00:54:32,361
So let's just do a couple
more simple computations here.

872
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:36,630
Uh, just to give you an idea of
how Fisher helped here. Okay.

873
00:54:36,631 --> 00:54:39,180
So I'm going to do a few mortgage things.
I'm going to do a few.

874
00:54:39,181 --> 00:54:44,160
I haven't defined mortgage yet
the way. Why did I do that? Um,

875
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,990
so a mortgage is just a 30 year annuity,
a mortgage.

876
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:55,030
So one more thing on the mortgage
is an annuity. A fixed mortgage.

877
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:02,510
Okay. A fixed mortgage.
A fixed rate mortgage.

878
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:06,363
Okay.

879
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,710
Mortgage, uh, is define

880
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,910
by a principal.

881
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,640
Okay. So we're going to, when
we talk about the crisis,

882
00:55:20,641 --> 00:55:23,910
this word principal will come up all
the time. So that's the face value.

883
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:27,540
The principal,
I'm mortgage coupon rate,

884
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,520
coupon rate,

885
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:36,890
and a principal and mortgage coupon rate,

886
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:39,110
and a maturity.

887
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:45,760
So the most common,
this is a fixed rate mortgage.

888
00:55:45,761 --> 00:55:49,200
So the most common kind
of maturity is 30 years,

889
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:54,420
30 years is the most common. And then
sometimes they're 15 year mortgages.

890
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:57,540
And then there's a whole host of other
mortgages we're going to come to later

891
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:00,420
where there's floating interest rates.
So the 30 year mortgage,

892
00:56:00,421 --> 00:56:03,630
how much do you have to pay?
Well, there's one, you know,

893
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:08,660
if it were on an annual payment and
it were an 8% mortgage for 30 years on

894
00:56:10,471 --> 00:56:14,250
$100,000 so if it was $100,000 principal,

895
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,120
an 8% coupon,

896
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:21,170
okay,

897
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:22,730
okay. Uh, for 30,

898
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:26,650
we just calculated that
you would have to pay,

899
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:31,710
the payment would be $8,888 a year
because $8,888 a year discounted at 8% is

900
00:56:37,271 --> 00:56:41,980
going to give you 100,000. Okay.
So that's how the mortgage works.

901
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:44,560
Once they've told you that.
So whenever you hear about a mortgage,

902
00:56:44,561 --> 00:56:47,920
you always hear the mortgage rate,
that's the coupon rate. Okay.

903
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:50,710
The maturity is usually 30 years,
you know,

904
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:53,230
then you'd have to be told
how much the mortgage was for.

905
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,460
Then you can figure out what does the
guy have to pay every year. And it's,

906
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:57,821
you know,

907
00:56:57,821 --> 00:57:02,080
you just figure out the annuity payment
that at this interest rate makes his

908
00:57:02,081 --> 00:57:05,680
payments have present value with this
interest rate equal to the principal.

909
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:08,260
So he just saw his 8,888 a year.

910
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:12,130
And there's one more little
twist with mortgages. Okay.

911
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,220
So that's not literally
true. What I said. Mortgages

912
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:22,180
have monthly payments,
monthly payments.

913
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:28,420
Okay. Monthly payments,
their monthly payments. Uh,

914
00:57:28,421 --> 00:57:30,760
and so the monthly rate,

915
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:34,023
yeah,

916
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:39,110
at monthly rate equal the coupon
divided by 12 so if it's an 8% mortgage,

917
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:44,670
then it means that they're,
they're taking two thirds.

918
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:49,700
So in this case we'd have 8% over 12
which equals two thirds of a percent.

919
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:54,890
Okay.
So the mortgage would be in a 0.67%

920
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:57,443
okay.

921
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:00,220
Okay. And so then you do
the monthly calculations,

922
00:58:00,221 --> 00:58:05,221
you have to figure out the c such that
summation over one plus two thirds

923
00:58:06,081 --> 00:58:09,740
percent.
That's 1.067 in other words,

924
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:15,340
1.0672 the t t equals one to three 60 has
to equal 100,000 that's how much you'd

925
00:58:19,221 --> 00:58:23,190
have to, yeah. Hey, every
month. And so it wouldn't,

926
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:26,790
it wouldn't be 8,880 a year.

927
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:32,150
It'd be slightly more than
8,888 divided by 12 every month.

928
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:35,190
Okay. But anyway, these are just, okay,

929
00:58:35,191 --> 00:58:39,090
so this is the last of these
definitions for today's class.

930
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:44,240
So everybody who's on Wall Street knows
what a perpetuity is and they know how

931
00:58:45,151 --> 00:58:47,430
to compute its value at
a given interest rate.

932
00:58:47,431 --> 00:58:51,720
They know what an annuity is and how to
compute its present value of mortgage is

933
00:58:51,721 --> 00:58:54,450
almost the same thing as an annuity,
okay?

934
00:58:54,451 --> 00:58:59,451
The only twist is that the mortgage is
competed monthly instead of annually,

935
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,480
but when they using a
monthly interest rate,

936
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,430
but when they say the
monthly interest rate,

937
00:59:05,431 --> 00:59:07,080
instead of telling you
the monthly interest rate,

938
00:59:07,081 --> 00:59:11,670
they tell you the monthly interest rate
times 12. Okay? It's just a convention.

939
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:15,600
All right? So those are all the
things you have to memorize.

940
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:20,910
Now what?
Let's try to use the way we can think,

941
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,750
okay.
And do some practical problems here.

942
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:26,690
So here's one of my,

943
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:31,040
one of the simplest and most important
ones is let's say you're a Yale professor.

944
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:34,400
I gave this example in the very first
day of class. You're a Yale professor.

945
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,680
When I first gave the example a
few years ago when I, when I, uh,

946
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:41,300
wrote the notes,
the average Yale professor over,

947
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:43,520
so this was quite a few years ago,
eight or nine years ago,

948
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:46,670
was making 115,000 a
year. It has, it happens.

949
00:59:46,671 --> 00:59:51,320
The average Yale salary now is
150,000 a year. Okay. But anyway,

950
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:53,480
when I wrote it,
it was 115,000 a year.

951
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:56,480
So let's suppose that
you're starting today,

952
00:59:56,510 --> 01:00:01,510
this year's professors are making 115,000
and let's say your salary will go up,

953
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:05,473
go up

954
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,550
at 3% inflation

955
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:12,063
every year.

956
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:20,610
Okay? So, uh,

957
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:23,840
and that's inflation.
That's equal to the general inflation.

958
01:00:23,841 --> 01:00:27,950
So your salary is keeping
pace with general inflation
and no more. So professors,

959
01:00:27,951 --> 01:00:30,410
you know,
we're not doing that well.

960
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:35,120
So the salary is going is 115,000
now it would be 150,000 but anyway,

961
01:00:35,121 --> 01:00:36,770
it was 115,000 on average.

962
01:00:36,771 --> 01:00:39,140
And let's say you're just going to
be kept up with inflation. You know,

963
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:42,200
they're going to be, you're going to
be told every year you have a 3% raise.

964
01:00:42,201 --> 01:00:44,000
But that's just going to
keep you up with inflation.

965
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,180
Now you know you're going
to work for 30 years,

966
01:00:47,181 --> 01:00:52,181
let's say 30 years and
retire for 30 years.

967
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:56,800
A little ambitious about of
how long you're gonna live,

968
01:00:56,801 --> 01:00:59,470
but let's just suppose that's what you
think you're going to live for 30 years

969
01:00:59,471 --> 01:01:04,450
after that. So how much should you spend
every year? Well, you can't answer that.

970
01:01:04,451 --> 01:01:08,680
And let's say you want level
level real consumption.

971
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:13,730
Yeah.

972
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:17,090
So you want to consume the same amount
every year for the rest of your life,

973
01:01:17,091 --> 01:01:20,000
which is going to be 60
years, 38 Yale, 30 retired.

974
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:24,050
So how much do you spend every
year in, in consumption? Okay,

975
01:01:24,051 --> 01:01:26,180
well you can't answer that until
you know the interest rate.

976
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:31,170
So let's say the interest rate,
the nominal interest rate

977
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:39,480
equals let's say a 5.3% about a
little bit more than 5.3% okay?

978
01:01:44,351 --> 01:01:49,351
So phenomenal interest rate
is 5.3% inflation knows is
going to be 3% and you've

979
01:01:50,561 --> 01:01:53,890
got 115,000 coming going up
with inflation every year.

980
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:57,640
How are you ever going to figure out how
much to spend starting next year when

981
01:01:57,641 --> 01:02:01,570
your job starts? It looks like a
hopeless thing. You'd have to say, well,

982
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:06,490
if I get 115,000 next year, I consume
some of it. I put the rest in the bank.

983
01:02:06,491 --> 01:02:08,590
It makes you no interest.

984
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:13,591
It grows at 5.3% but then inflation is
3% so I take that into account and figure

985
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:17,320
out how much to spend the year after that.
But then I'm gonna get 115,000 more.

986
01:02:17,321 --> 01:02:20,520
That's all. Save something
maybe more for my next thing.

987
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:24,930
And then I'll deposit that in another
5.3% and I have to take into account

988
01:02:24,931 --> 01:02:27,930
inflation at 3% wait, it sounds
like as you get very complicated,

989
01:02:27,931 --> 01:02:29,220
how are you going to figure this out?

990
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:34,520
But in fact it's very simple and Irving
Fisher pointed the way to do it and we

991
01:02:34,621 --> 01:02:37,380
can now do it in our heads.
Okay, so Fisher said,

992
01:02:37,381 --> 01:02:39,990
don't figure out all this year
by year stuff it's going to be,

993
01:02:39,991 --> 01:02:42,800
and don't get mixed up with the
rate of inflation. You don't,

994
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:44,970
you don't care about inflation,

995
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:48,060
you're going to look through the
inflation and only care about the real

996
01:02:48,061 --> 01:02:52,200
consumption. So the fact is you care
about the real rate of interest.

997
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:53,520
So the real rate of interest,

998
01:02:53,521 --> 01:02:58,350
one plus r equals one plus I
over the rate of inflation,

999
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:02,460
which equals 1.053 over one point,

1000
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:04,590
uh,
old three,

1001
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:09,210
which is about 1.0 to three right?
This is a,

1002
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:12,780
we're doing things in our head now so we
have to be a little bit approximating.

1003
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:15,570
So right,
if I divide this by this,

1004
01:03:15,571 --> 01:03:19,710
these numbers are so close to one that
I'm basically just subtracting the bottom

1005
01:03:19,711 --> 01:03:22,230
from the denominator,
from the numerator.

1006
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:27,360
If I multiply one plus
g times one plus PSI,

1007
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:32,070
all right,
one plus g times one plus R,

1008
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:37,140
that's going to equal one
plus g Plus r plus Rg.

1009
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:41,790
And if our is very cool, you know it
was point all three ours, you know,

1010
01:03:41,791 --> 01:03:46,791
if this is 0.02 and this is 0.03 then
the multiplication is 0.06 so this is

1011
01:03:46,951 --> 01:03:50,670
practically irrelevant. So multiplying
numbers like this or dividing them,

1012
01:03:50,671 --> 01:03:54,000
it's just like adding these things.
So it's just like adding,

1013
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:56,880
taking this term and subtracting that.
Okay.

1014
01:03:56,881 --> 01:04:00,390
So when you get a number near one
divided by another number near one,

1015
01:04:00,391 --> 01:04:03,510
you just take the difference from one in
the numerator minus the difference from

1016
01:04:03,511 --> 01:04:08,490
one of the nominators is pretty close
to doing actually the division. Okay.

1017
01:04:08,491 --> 01:04:11,070
So this is about 2.3% interest.

1018
01:04:11,071 --> 01:04:15,960
So the real interest rate is
about 2.3% so Fisher would say,

1019
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:18,360
Aha,
use the real rate of interest.

1020
01:04:18,361 --> 01:04:23,361
You're getting 115,000 wheel payments
every year for 30 years at a real interest

1021
01:04:24,061 --> 01:04:27,540
rate of 2.3% but we know what that is.

1022
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:32,720
So what is 115,000 of real dollars every
year at a real rate of 0.0 to 3% we'll

1023
01:04:36,541 --> 01:04:40,080
remember what our formula was.
It's the cash you're getting every year,

1024
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,800
two or perpetuity.
You got it every year forever.

1025
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:47,910
It would just be the cash you're
getting divided by the interest.

1026
01:04:47,911 --> 01:04:52,110
So 115,000 that's over a 10th
of a million every year forever.

1027
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:56,430
At 2.3% interest. That would be
worth, that's 5 million so far.

1028
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:01,860
But you're not getting it every year.
You're getting it for 30 years.

1029
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:07,070
So one minus 1.0 to
three to the 30th okay.

1030
01:05:08,161 --> 01:05:09,510
So what's that equal to?

1031
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:18,070
No longer 5 million because that would be

1032
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:19,420
getting the money forever.

1033
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:26,870
Okay.
One Point Oh to three to the 30th is what?

1034
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,950
Okay,
so we said that 2.3% interest,

1035
01:05:31,951 --> 01:05:35,690
it's 2.3 and the 72 is a,
you know,

1036
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:40,760
2.3 times 30 or 69 so because it's close
to zero of the 69 rule almost works.

1037
01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:42,901
So anyway,

1038
01:05:42,901 --> 01:05:47,901
I'm proximation would say 2.3 and to 72
it was just a little bit over 30 okay.

1039
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:51,990
So it doubles every 30 years
and you've got it for 30 years.

1040
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:56,820
So it's just going to be to,
this number is about two right?

1041
01:05:56,821 --> 01:06:01,821
2.3% into 72 is approximately 30 so
every 30 years at this interest rate in

1042
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:05,880
doubles.

1043
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:10,880
So therefore you've got one
15,000 over 0.023 times.

1044
01:06:11,971 --> 01:06:13,140
One minus a half.

1045
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:17,130
You've lost half the value
by not getting it forever.

1046
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:20,550
So that's 2.5 million.
So Fisher says, look,

1047
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:23,790
remember the budget set in and gee,
we studied budget set.

1048
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:28,820
We put p one x one plus
p two x two plus P,

1049
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:30,541
you know,

1050
01:06:30,541 --> 01:06:35,541
60 x 60 that's in the left hand side is
less than or equal to p one endowment,

1051
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:41,451
one plus p two endowment to plus
p 30 times in diamond 30 okay,

1052
01:06:42,961 --> 01:06:47,730
you're getting hundred 15,000 of
wheel goods every year for 30 years.

1053
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:52,760
P one is one over 1.0 to three p
two is one over 1.0323 squared,

1054
01:06:53,011 --> 01:06:53,844
et cetera.

1055
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:58,880
So this revenue on the right is just the
annuity of 30 years of 115,000 of real

1056
01:07:00,841 --> 01:07:04,730
goods.
So it's worth 5 million

1057
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:09,710
reduced because it's not a perpetuity.
It's only an annuity for 30 years.

1058
01:07:09,711 --> 01:07:13,130
And so it's worth 2.5 million.
So we've got the right hand side,

1059
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:17,610
that's this 2.5 million.
Hey,

1060
01:07:17,611 --> 01:07:18,960
that's how much the present value.

1061
01:07:18,961 --> 01:07:23,010
So that's what I'm a professor at
Yale can look forward to his entire,

1062
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,390
her entire career.

1063
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:28,860
She started 10 or 20 years ago would
be all that you'll make two and a half

1064
01:07:28,861 --> 01:07:33,660
million in present value terms. She'd gone
to Wall Street, you know, in five years.

1065
01:07:33,661 --> 01:07:35,940
If she were Yale undergraduate,
Wendell,

1066
01:07:35,941 --> 01:07:37,740
what we'll Wall Street
in five or 10 years,

1067
01:07:37,741 --> 01:07:42,240
she'd be making more than that
every year. So what? Uh, so,

1068
01:07:42,241 --> 01:07:45,900
well not everybody, but
anyway, so um, okay,

1069
01:07:45,901 --> 01:07:50,850
so how much did she spend every
single year of her 60 year life?

1070
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:52,153
Well,

1071
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:57,650
so we have to figure out this
number, see the coupon, right?

1072
01:07:57,651 --> 01:08:00,830
We have to figure out how much can
we spend every year of her life.

1073
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:09,770
What? See can she spend at
2.3% interest? We're now,

1074
01:08:09,771 --> 01:08:14,450
I have a 60 here. Okay. So,

1075
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:20,340
so it's an annuity of 60 years of constant
consumption at this interest rate.

1076
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:23,740
So how much is it worth?
Okay,

1077
01:08:23,741 --> 01:08:26,830
well I have to just figure
out 1.0 to three to the 60th.

1078
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:31,300
One Point Oh to three to the 30th
was a half 1.0 to three to this I,

1079
01:08:31,301 --> 01:08:35,440
it was to 1.0 to three to the 60th
is four. So this is one fourth.

1080
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:42,760
Hey, so, so we have three quarters
here. So this is, you know,

1081
01:08:42,761 --> 01:08:47,350
see over 0.023 times,
three quarters.

1082
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:51,940
That's what we have. So you
multiply four thirds by 2.5 million,

1083
01:08:51,941 --> 01:08:56,941
you get 10 million equals 10
million over three equals point.

1084
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:00,260
So it's a point,

1085
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:07,130
this is a 0.023 times three
divided by three times 10 million.

1086
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:16,370
We'll see. Okay. And so that's like 76,000

1087
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:18,533
something.

1088
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:26,630
Okay. Three and 2.0 to three is 76 and
then you have to figure out, you know,

1089
01:09:26,631 --> 01:09:30,020
what decimal place you're at and
you know it's going to be more,

1090
01:09:30,021 --> 01:09:34,250
it's going to be less than 115,000 so
it's gotta be some number that's close,

1091
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:34,800
you know,

1092
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:39,800
some reasonable percentage of 115,000
so it works out to 76,000 so that's it.

1093
01:09:40,131 --> 01:09:42,980
You could do that in your head.
I mean, not today, but you know,

1094
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,480
after looking at it for,
you know,

1095
01:09:44,481 --> 01:09:46,340
by next time they'll be able
to do that in your head.

1096
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:50,660
So this professor can figure out what
you should do. Seems like a hard problem.

1097
01:09:50,661 --> 01:09:51,494
You know,
it's life.

1098
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:54,440
You've got to figure out what to do
every year and now you know how to do it

1099
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:56,450
very easily.
Okay.

1100
01:09:56,810 --> 01:09:59,630
So any questions about this?

1101
01:09:59,631 --> 01:10:04,080
I want to do one more little example.
All right,

1102
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:08,040
so let's do our heart or example.
When I was a,

1103
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:09,630
it's easier computationally,

1104
01:10:09,631 --> 01:10:14,240
but harder conceptually when
I was just got tenure at eal,

1105
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:19,230
uh, actually I had tenure for a few years.
You'll see why this is relevant. Um,

1106
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:24,620
the president Benno Schmidt of Yale
said a horrible thing has happened.

1107
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:27,930
Generations of yield presidents before me

1108
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:33,020
have not realized that the buildings
were not getting the proper care.

1109
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:36,770
There is deferred maintenance
generation after generation did know,

1110
01:10:36,771 --> 01:10:38,090
fixing up of the buildings.

1111
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:42,560
I'm the first president who's going to
act responsibly and fix up the buildings.

1112
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:46,400
And he said,
um,

1113
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:49,370
I'm going to fix up the buildings.

1114
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:56,810
And I can tell you that I've hired these
planners and they've come and done an

1115
01:10:56,811 --> 01:11:01,790
exhaustive study and we have
to spend 100 million a year

1116
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:07,370
for 10 years each year.
I said each year,

1117
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:12,170
each year for 10 years to fix
up the buildings properly.

1118
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:15,060
That plan,
by the way,

1119
01:11:15,061 --> 01:11:17,970
is the thing that got turned
into fixing one college a year.

1120
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:21,810
So a hundred million for 10 years.
That's what we need.

1121
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:24,330
These presidents before
me have overlooked it.

1122
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:28,260
They spent as if we don't have to keep up
the buildings. I recognize the problem,

1123
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:31,830
I'm going to correct it. This is a huge
expense. They didn't take into account.

1124
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:33,570
We have to reduce the budget.

1125
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:38,100
So how much do you reduce the budget by
how much he cuts would he have made in

1126
01:11:38,101 --> 01:11:42,750
his first, in that first year, how would
you figure it out, what to do? Okay,

1127
01:11:42,751 --> 01:11:46,680
so what he did is he recommended
firing 15% of the faculty,

1128
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:51,870
which didn't go over very well. And
the faculty, it was an amazing thing.

1129
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:55,800
How can you, you know,
there's no structure at Yale.
The president runs heal.

1130
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:59,280
There's no senate, there's no
labor union, there's no nothing.

1131
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:01,890
It's just the president.
Suppose the president announces,

1132
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,670
I'm going to get rid of
15% of the faculty. What is
the faculty supposed to do?

1133
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,710
So,
I mean there's no mechanism.

1134
01:12:07,711 --> 01:12:11,820
So what happened is the old deans who
are no longer deans, they were just old.

1135
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:15,510
Almost all of them were men.
Again, I guess old guys,
they got together and said,

1136
01:12:15,511 --> 01:12:19,440
well, we have no power. We have no
position. But we used to be deans at Yale.

1137
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:21,060
It's up to us to do something.

1138
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:24,480
We're going to appoint a committee
who's going to examine the logic of the

1139
01:12:24,481 --> 01:12:25,650
president's decision.

1140
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:30,150
So we're going to a 0.6 people that
we're going to pick out of the blue and

1141
01:12:30,151 --> 01:12:35,010
they're going to make a report to the
faculty and tell us what to do. So, um,

1142
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:39,840
I was one of the six and the
other five guys were pretty, uh,

1143
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:43,020
nervous. Well, we are all
were nervous about, um,

1144
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:46,320
actually getting up in front of the
president and the provost and the Dean and

1145
01:12:46,321 --> 01:12:49,250
saying that it was all wrong
and he shouldn't do this. So,

1146
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:54,420
but we had tenure so we couldn't get up
and say whatever the hell we wanted to.

1147
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:58,650
Okay. So what did I say? What would you
have said if you were me? Okay. Now,

1148
01:12:58,651 --> 01:13:03,090
the whole budget was,
the whole budget of Yale was 1 billion

1149
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:06,870
equals annual budget

1150
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:12,520
and a lot of things you can't cut.

1151
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:16,090
So not as a hundred million a
year is 10% of the annual budget.

1152
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:21,420
Okay. So he basically said,
well, we've got a, you know,

1153
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:25,570
we've got 100 million a year, we're at
a cutout, you know, 10% of the budget.

1154
01:13:25,571 --> 01:13:28,090
And since there's some things
we can't get rid of, you know,

1155
01:13:28,091 --> 01:13:31,210
we got to keep making fixed payments
and the faculty something, you know,

1156
01:13:31,211 --> 01:13:34,270
of course I'm not going to
fire the tenured faculty.
I'm going to fire, you know,

1157
01:13:34,271 --> 01:13:36,850
people who aren't tenured
and when faculty retire,

1158
01:13:36,851 --> 01:13:38,680
I just won't hire anyone to replace them.

1159
01:13:38,681 --> 01:13:41,350
That's how I'm going to get rid of the
fact that that's how he got the 15%.

1160
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:44,050
So what would you, uh,
what would you have done?

1161
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:46,720
What would you have said if you were me,
don't do it,

1162
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,630
but what else would you have said?
What calculation can you do?

1163
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,930
So you know now what to say.
You can't think of what to say.

1164
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:58,050
So what would you say? Sorry,
I'll come to you in a second.

1165
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:05,690
What's a reasonable number? How would
you think of a reasonable number?

1166
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:14,230
Let's take his facts correct. In fact,
they didn't turn out to be that far off.

1167
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:18,000
I mean, the central, the, the, the,
the people he hired were pretty good.

1168
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:20,493
Okay.

1169
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:23,450
At assessing how much stuff
needed to be done. Yes.

1170
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:27,260
I guess the first thing you do,
10 years

1171
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:32,703
and then what?

1172
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,820
Okay.
It sounds like couldn't start now.

1173
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:42,870
He says the first thing he'd do is he
think about what a 10 year annuity at $100

1174
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:47,470
million a year is worth. Okay. So why
would he want to do that? So that's good.

1175
01:14:47,471 --> 01:14:51,370
That's what he should do. That's how I
started. But what's the relevance of that?

1176
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:54,223
Yup.

1177
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:58,660
Right.
So he could,

1178
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:01,190
yeah.

1179
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:05,780
Okay. So he could say, alumni,
please do something about, you know,

1180
01:15:05,870 --> 01:15:09,320
it's $1 billion, not quite something
less than a billion dollars.

1181
01:15:09,321 --> 01:15:12,740
We'll figure it out in a minute. So
alumni please hand over, you know,

1182
01:15:12,741 --> 01:15:16,760
three quarters of $1 billion and a,
I want to have to fire my faculty.

1183
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:22,310
Okay. He could try that. What if the
alumni didn't come through? Now you,

1184
01:15:22,370 --> 01:15:23,280
I know you're going to say something.

1185
01:15:23,290 --> 01:15:25,520
I'm going to give him a couple of
more people a chance back there. Yep.

1186
01:15:34,950 --> 01:15:35,783
Okay.

1187
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:41,300
So you would short 10 year annuity.
Okay.

1188
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,470
What were you gonna say?

1189
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:54,173
Yup.

1190
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:09,580
Okay, now we're on the
right track. Exactly. So I'm
going to go a step further.

1191
01:16:09,581 --> 01:16:13,390
I went a step further. I said,
you know, Yale is forever.

1192
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:15,280
So what he's telling us,

1193
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:21,100
what he's telling us is that we need to
catch up to where we should be to make

1194
01:16:21,701 --> 01:16:24,820
up for all that lost, you know,
maintenance. He's not saying, by the way,

1195
01:16:24,821 --> 01:16:26,810
that the presidents who built,
you know,

1196
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:30,640
the colleges and the 1920s and stuff
weren't paying attention to the physical

1197
01:16:30,641 --> 01:16:33,550
plant. He was talking about
the few generations before him.

1198
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:38,730
So once we make up for those losses
and then return to a steady state,

1199
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:43,000
you know, after spending the a
hundred million a year for 10 years,

1200
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:47,140
we'll be back to Yale in a steady state.
Yale is going to go on forever.

1201
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:51,340
So the point is,
why should the 10 years,

1202
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:56,580
why should the next 10 years generation
pay for something that's going to,

1203
01:16:57,191 --> 01:17:00,820
you know, make Yale better for
the whole infinite future of Yale.

1204
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:05,470
So I said, how much would every
generation, not just today,

1205
01:17:05,471 --> 01:17:06,820
but forever in the future,

1206
01:17:06,821 --> 01:17:10,970
have to consume less in order to
make up for this one shot problem,

1207
01:17:10,971 --> 01:17:15,130
this deferred maintenance that a couple
of generations of Yale presidents, uh,

1208
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:18,240
didn't put in. So in other words, um,

1209
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:23,620
I would figure out the present
value of the 10 year a hundred mil

1210
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:28,730
annuity.
Okay.

1211
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:33,760
And then I would set that equal
to what coupon a perpetuity

1212
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:42,230
gives you the same present
value. Okay? So, all right,

1213
01:17:42,231 --> 01:17:44,450
so how can you figure that out?
So in other words,

1214
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:46,970
if you lose 100 million for 10 years,

1215
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:51,110
that's equivalent to how
much less for every year.

1216
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:54,740
Okay. So, uh, it turns out
to be quite a big deal.

1217
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:56,780
So it depends on what
the interest rate is.

1218
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:01,040
So let's say now it happens
that Yale has an interest rate.

1219
01:18:01,041 --> 01:18:03,380
Yale always uses this 5% rule.

1220
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:07,580
So if you take are equal to 5%,
um,

1221
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:10,010
that's supposedly the money.
Yale,

1222
01:18:10,011 --> 01:18:14,450
after inflation is confident that it can
get on incent Dalman usually it thinks

1223
01:18:14,451 --> 01:18:16,730
it can get more.
You'd figure out what the,

1224
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:20,570
what the annuity value is of 100 million.
Okay. So I'm over time. So anyway,

1225
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:24,290
we're going to have to, so the punch
line is it comes to 32 million a year,

1226
01:18:24,291 --> 01:18:27,500
not 100 million a year.
We'll do this calculation next time,

1227
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:31,880
and you don't need to fire 15% of
the faculty to get 32 million a year.

1228
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:33,240
So we'll start next time.
