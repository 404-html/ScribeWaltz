1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,900
We considered for a long time,
a world of certain day, um,

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:07,750
oops,
something's okay.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,070
Consider it a world of certainty where
we assumed we could foresee the future

4
00:00:12,071 --> 00:00:16,570
perfectly and we still managed to
figure out fairly interesting things,

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,650
but the world is much more complicated
that than that it's a world of

6
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:24,550
uncertainty. And in a
world of uncertainty, uh,

7
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:29,110
economics is, comes into its own as
a f I think, fascinating subject.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,880
So I spend a little time reviewing some
mathematics for you last time that many

9
00:00:33,881 --> 00:00:34,720
of you already knew.

10
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:39,721
So I'm going to take that for granted
going forward and just start over this

11
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:43,510
time from an economic perspective
instead of a mathematical perspective.

12
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,870
So suppose today that we assume that
you could buy a stock today who's price

13
00:00:51,561 --> 00:00:56,140
tomorrow could be a 104 or 98 with 50,

14
00:00:56,141 --> 00:01:01,030
50 probabilities. And we assume that
everybody knew the probabilities.

15
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:02,463
Okay,

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,930
no probabilities and maximize

17
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,010
expected. Hey, uh,

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,850
next period.

19
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,450
Okay, well, uh, plus, uh,

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,650
paying off this period

21
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,590
if we assumed,
and we're going to drop this assumption,

22
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:35,890
but I might keep it for a little while
if we assume that all people cared about

23
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,290
was the expected payoff next period.

24
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,720
And of course they care about
their pay off this period,

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,870
what would the value of
this stock have to be? Well,

26
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,630
under the simple rule for how people act,

27
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,890
you'd take a half times 104
plus a half times 98. Yeah.

28
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,700
And that would give you, uh,
what would that give you?

29
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,120
Give you a 101.
Okay.

30
00:01:58,121 --> 00:02:03,121
Because this is plus four times a half
is plus two minus one minus two times a

31
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:07,060
half, which is minus one. So it's
plus one. So that'll give you 101.

32
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,810
So you would say that the price of
the stock today would have to be 101.

33
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,670
Now we could slightly refine this utility
function and see people maximize the

34
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,840
discounted

35
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,060
expected payoff next period.
Plus the payoff this period.

36
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,010
And if the discount

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,200
is Wa is a a hundred over 101 okay,

38
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:36,410
then we're going to have to multiply this
by a hundred over 101 and we'll get a

39
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:41,060
price of 100 okay,
so that's the basic first step.

40
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,160
We can incorporate uncertainty by assuming
people replace the uncertain outcomes

41
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,100
with certain outcomes in their head.
And then discount,

42
00:02:49,101 --> 00:02:52,670
just like we've seen before,
of course before we had utility functions,

43
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:54,140
but I'm not going to do that quite yet.

44
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,440
I'm just going to say suppose
that we just did that. All right.

45
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,740
That would give us a theory of people
manage their manage uncertainty in react

46
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:05,470
to uncertainty and how they
set the prices. All right,

47
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:10,000
so what's the expected uh,
expectation theory of pricing.

48
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,100
Now, before we complicate the theory, I
want to just take this literally as true,

49
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,640
true and make some inferences from it.
Well,

50
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:21,430
the first in France you can make,
is that right?

51
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,773
MMM.

52
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,810
Today's price.

53
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,100
Today's price would then be the
ex the discounted expectation

54
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,210
of tomorrow's price.
Okay.

55
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,310
That's just repeating the same thing.

56
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,580
But what's an implication of that and
implication of that is if you didn't know

57
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:51,850
tomorrow's price?

58
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,593
No,

59
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,970
the expectation of tomorrow's price,

60
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,450
you could guess today's price.

61
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:09,540
Okay,

62
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,900
it's, I'm writing out this trivial fuck
because it's such an important idea.

63
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,900
Once you have a theory
of how price is formed,

64
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:21,020
you can always go backwards and as the
naive uninformed member of a society,

65
00:04:22,981 --> 00:04:25,860
you can learn instead of about
learning about the stocks,

66
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,950
you can learn all you need to learn.
Perhaps by looking at the price,

67
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:32,640
you may be interested in what the expected
value of the stock is. Next period.

68
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,120
To do that in a serious way,
you'd have to study the firm's study,

69
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:40,430
the product study, the new inventions.
It was trying to learn new technologies.

70
00:04:40,431 --> 00:04:43,680
It was trying to adopt, get some
idea of the quality of the manager.

71
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,140
You'd have to do a million
things to figure that out,

72
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,000
but if you just look at the price today,

73
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,130
maybe that's going to give
you a good expectation,

74
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:54,660
a good idea of what the expected
value of the firm is next period. So,

75
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:59,661
and that's another way that also
implies you can test the theory.

76
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,120
You know,

77
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,120
is it true that typically today's
price is a good forecast of the price

78
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:10,500
tomorrow,
the expected price tomorrow?

79
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,400
Obviously you can't just
look at one instance because
you would just be looking,

80
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:15,330
if things went up,

81
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:19,560
you'd be just looking at the 104 and a
hundred wouldn't be a good guess of 104.

82
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,610
But if you did this the next day and
things were independent on the second day

83
00:05:23,611 --> 00:05:27,480
of the first day, you'd have a new
price, a hundred for the next day.

84
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,240
And you could see whether the
price went up or down or not.

85
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,140
And by doing this a thousand
times or 100,000 times,

86
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:35,790
you'd get a good idea if on average,

87
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:39,480
today's price was a pretty good
predictor of tomorrow's price.

88
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,640
Okay. So here's the,

89
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,200
um,
so I did that experiment and here it is,

90
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,893
right?

91
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,200
Uh, why is this all small? Okay,

92
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,500
so from 1980 I didn't do this.
Someone at my,

93
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,910
I got someone this morning
to do this at my hedge fund.

94
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,350
So what did he do? He said, um,

95
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,560
suppose you had a dollar to put in each
day starting in 1980 you could cheat,

96
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:18,020
keep track of uh,
how many dollars.

97
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,420
So you got $100 you can,

98
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,840
so it's $100 you have
$100 to invest each day.

99
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,253
MMM.

100
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,800
Starting January 1st,

101
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,230
1980 you put it into the s and p 500.

102
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,370
So you put it equally into all stocks,
the 500 biggest stocks,

103
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,810
and you'll see what the total price
of those 500 stocks is the next day.

104
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:45,230
And you subtract the original price and
that gives you your return on the first

105
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:48,360
day percent return on the first day.
For example,

106
00:06:48,361 --> 00:06:51,030
it was 101 seems like
it went up a little bit.

107
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,710
You'd have a 1% you'd have made a dollar
in the first day. Then I told the guy,

108
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,240
or he decided himself,

109
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:02,330
put $100 in the second day in the s and
p 500 and see what happened to that the

110
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,280
next day.
Maybe it went up $3 the second day.

111
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:10,230
So your total after two days
would be $4 not your total return.

112
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,750
Well, that's how he's written
it. It's just the, you know,

113
00:07:12,751 --> 00:07:15,270
the first day the stock
went up by a dollar,

114
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,830
the hundred dollars went up by a dollar.

115
00:07:16,831 --> 00:07:20,850
The second day went up by $3
so all together went up by $4.

116
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,120
So the hypothesis is that today's price
is a good forecast of tomorrow's price.

117
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,700
So if you're averaging the pluses
and minuses over many days,

118
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:34,590
so there are 250 days for 30 years here,
that's a lot of days you're averaging.

119
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,840
So,
and you just see,

120
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:39,150
and this is the cumulative total
of what would have happened to you.

121
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,430
Okay. So, um,

122
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,713
well

123
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:50,490
that hundred dollars, if he did that
experiment, you know, 7,000 times,

124
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,120
30 times 250,
30 Times,

125
00:07:54,121 --> 00:07:56,850
250th 7,500 times,

126
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:01,320
you would have ended up
with 350 or $400 by the end.

127
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:05,220
Okay. So does that contradict or, um,

128
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:10,310
confirm the hypothesis that we've just
made the today's price a good forecast of

129
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,670
the expectation of tomorrow's price?
What would you say?

130
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,110
Okay. Well, so that's a subtle answer.

131
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:32,560
So there are two things that I expected
you to say. That one being the second,

132
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,470
and I'm very important one. Um, you know,

133
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,920
it looks like $100 became $250,
you know,

134
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:43,360
300 $400 but that was over 30 years.

135
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,230
So what was the game per year,
you know,

136
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:52,231
7,500 days and you got a return of 250%
so you have to divide 250 by 7,500 and

137
00:08:57,121 --> 00:09:00,180
you get some incredibly low number.
I forgot what it was,

138
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,040
but it was something like 0.004,

139
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,900
7% something like that.

140
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,583
Yeah.

141
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,050
Okay.
So you're making,

142
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:16,250
so this is percent I've
already divided by,

143
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,110
um, I've already divided by a
hundred to turn it into percentages.

144
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,570
So you make a tiny return,
you know,

145
00:09:23,571 --> 00:09:27,950
on $100 you might go up on
average the next day to a hundred,

146
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:33,050
you know, and, and a half
dollars. Okay. But that's making
it, you know, and, and uh,

147
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,610
but at this 0.04, 7%. So
$1 would be, you know,

148
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:40,280
1% but this is, you know,
it would be a one here,

149
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:42,410
but we're not a lot of
decimal places there.

150
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:47,300
So you're dividing 250 by 7,500 maybe
I've got one decimal to money there.

151
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,790
So this is a tiny number.
So in fact,

152
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:53,930
today's price is a pretty good
estimate of tomorrow's price. You know,

153
00:09:53,931 --> 00:09:58,210
you have $100 and maybe it'll turn
in on average two a hundred uh,

154
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:03,270
0.4, $7 tomorrow. Okay, so, you know,

155
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,520
compare it to knowing nothing.

156
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,380
If you asked yourself what's the average
value of this stock tomorrow, you don't,

157
00:10:09,381 --> 00:10:11,540
no one's telling you it's
normalized at a hundred.

158
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,660
It could be 500 it could be 23 it could
be 75 who knows what the average of

159
00:10:16,761 --> 00:10:18,670
these stocks are.
The S and p 500 is,

160
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,670
is mixing stocks that are worth three
with stocks that are worth 500 per share

161
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:25,130
with stocks that are worth 75 per share.

162
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:30,310
And it turns out that it's
such an accurate predictor
that you only are off by a

163
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,450
fraction of 1% on average each day.
So compare it to knowing nothing.

164
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,280
You have a huge insight into what's going
on in the world and how valuable the

165
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:41,750
starts are going to be tomorrow.

166
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,810
Tomorrow hasn't happened yet already
by looking at the prices today,

167
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:48,170
you have a tremendous idea what
the prices are tomorrow. Okay,

168
00:10:48,171 --> 00:10:49,460
so that's the first thing to notice.

169
00:10:49,461 --> 00:10:52,730
The theories kind of confirmed the
second thing to notice as well,

170
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:56,120
it doesn't seem perfectly conformed
because this seems like a pretty positive

171
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,500
thing, you know, it seems to be going
up most of the time and as he said,

172
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,710
well we haven't done the discounting yet,
right.

173
00:11:03,711 --> 00:11:08,120
We should've done discounting because
tomorrow is not quite as important to you

174
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:11,150
as today. So I shouldn't have
just been looking at return.

175
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,730
I should have looked at return,
you know,

176
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,460
per day and so I should have discounted.

177
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,043
Okay.

178
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,540
Just counted each day

179
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,290
by whatever the interest rate is.

180
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:29,291
Let's say you think it's 4% in a year
divided by 250 since are 250 days a year.

181
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,790
So approximately I should have gotten
250 you know I should have discounted by

182
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:39,320
that. And so when you do that, the
number gets even much closer to zero.

183
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:43,010
Okay?
But it doesn't come exactly equal to zero.

184
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,580
And so we're going to see that we need
something else to make up the difference,

185
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:51,680
but it's such a tiny difference that
needs explaining. So to summarize,

186
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:55,960
we have this view that uncertainty is
going to change everything that we think

187
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,530
about the world and it will change
a lot of things dramatically,

188
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,980
but it's not going to
change the idea that today,

189
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,720
the price today of things is a pretty
good indicator of what their value is

190
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:10,660
going to be tomorrow. Okay?
If you replace value tomorrow,

191
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:13,390
which is uncertain by the
expected value tomorrow,

192
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,170
so you can still learn a tremendous
amount about the world just by looking at

193
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:21,970
the market. Okay. So that, that,
that's a very important a lesson.

194
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:26,320
So let's go a little further though.
Suppose that

195
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,020
you thought, well, maybe people, um,

196
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,190
maybe I want to ask a more
complicated question. I want to say,

197
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,990
suppose I only look at stocks
that went up yesterday.

198
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,810
Okay. I only worked look at
stocks that went up yesterday.

199
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,280
Now maybe there's something
about the market that, you know,

200
00:12:50,281 --> 00:12:53,640
momentum will keep carrying
those stocks up tomorrow.

201
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,920
So once the market gets rolling,
you know,

202
00:12:55,921 --> 00:12:59,340
maybe the market's not such
a good forecast. Maybe,
you know, as Schiller says,

203
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:01,590
they're all these
psychological forces at work.

204
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,920
And once things get rolling and
prices have gone up yesterday,

205
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,980
the price will keep
going up, uh, tomorrow.

206
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,540
So today's price won't be such a good
indicator of tomorrow's price because

207
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,260
tomorrow's price is
probably going to be higher.

208
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,610
So I'm going to repeat now exactly the
same experiment except putting a hundred

209
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:21,690
doll, except instead of putting
$100 in all the s and p 500,

210
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,650
I only put the hundred dollars into
the stocks that went up yesterday.

211
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,280
Or I might even refine it by,
uh,

212
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,580
selling short the stocks that
went down yesterday. Okay.
So how, what does that do?

213
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:38,240
Does that change the, uh, numbers?

214
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,250
MMM.
Okay.

215
00:13:43,251 --> 00:13:47,720
So if I blow this up, maybe it is blown
up. You can't do any better than that.

216
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,670
Okay. Does that change the numbers?
Well, no. In fact, it makes it worse.

217
00:13:52,671 --> 00:13:56,310
It's closer to zero now.
Okay. So again, overall,

218
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,840
this time to kind of went up to the
same peak but fell down even further.

219
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:04,520
So this is thing. So again,
the, the stock prices today,

220
00:14:04,521 --> 00:14:08,870
even if I tried to refine it and get more
clever, I try to fool the market. I say,

221
00:14:08,871 --> 00:14:11,120
okay, the market does
a good job. On average,

222
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,420
today's price is pretty good on average
of predicting tomorrow's prices.

223
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:18,360
What about today's prices of those
stocks that went up yesterday? You know,

224
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:23,240
momentum thing. Maybe that's
a, maybe that's not such a
good, maybe on that subset,

225
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:27,950
the market's not so good. Well, the
market is pretty good on those too. Okay.

226
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:32,870
So again, you have to, you know, do the
discounting and you have to do the, the,

227
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:35,540
uh, realize that there are
a huge number of days here.

228
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:40,190
So this tiny return is really nothing
averaged over all those numbers of days.

229
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,840
Okay. Well let's see if we can
come up with another strategy.

230
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,610
I forgot what other strategy I just
tried out here. Oh, suppose you could,

231
00:14:49,611 --> 00:14:52,580
um,
suppose you could say,

232
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,760
I want to choose only those stocks that
went up 20 days ago or 25 days ago or 14

233
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:01,760
days ago.
This number here,

234
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,790
these bars here represent for everything
in the essence for the s and p 500.

235
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,670
You try to say, what's the correlation?
You know, that's like the covariance,

236
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:12,500
but normalize.
So it's between zero and one.

237
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:17,650
What's the correlation of a
move yesterday and a move today?

238
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,890
Does the fact that the stock went up
yesterday mean that it's going to go up

239
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:22,970
today?

240
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,500
Or just the fact that the stock went up
three days a ago mean that it's going to

241
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:30,650
go up today and, uh, you know,
between today and tomorrow.

242
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:34,820
So if one up two days ago went up
yesterday from yesterday to today,

243
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,660
does that suggest that it's likely
to go up from today to tomorrow?

244
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,990
So with this says, of course if
you only did the experiment once,

245
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,440
you'd always find that it did something.
Okay.

246
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:48,410
So you have to do many experiments
and then figure out what the,

247
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,710
so this is a statistical thing to
sort of guess what the correlation is.

248
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:55,290
Estimate the correlation. So, um, it,

249
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,200
and then you have to see
whether it's significant.

250
00:15:57,201 --> 00:16:01,640
So anything in this blue band means
the numbers are insignificant.

251
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,270
So these bars represent
what the correlation is.

252
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,090
So no matter how far back you go,

253
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,290
you basically knowing which
way the stock went. You know,

254
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:16,880
27 days ago tells you almost nothing
about which way the stock is going to go

255
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:21,230
today. There's almost no correlation.
If it went up 27 days ago,

256
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:26,150
it's statistically, you know,
over the last 7,000, 500 days,

257
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,740
slightly more than half the time it
went up again today, but such a few,

258
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,300
such a small fraction of the time. Did
it go up again? Uh, you know, the, the,

259
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,020
the more times up and down that is
statistically insignificant. You know,

260
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:42,170
if you only do it five times and you're
always going to get three, you know,

261
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:43,760
it's going to have to
be one way or the other.

262
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:47,390
So if you do it in an odd number of times,
it can't be exactly even, and you know,

263
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:50,930
so you just figured out what statistical
significance is. So none of them, hardly,

264
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,190
almost none of them are statistically
significant. So once again,

265
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,690
it's not only the case that today's
prices are good forecasts of tomorrow's

266
00:16:59,691 --> 00:17:04,610
prices, but today's prices, even if you
add some information to it, seem to be,

267
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,151
you know,

268
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:09,830
even if you tried to refine your set and
look at only buying stocks that 27 days

269
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:10,664
ago went up,

270
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:14,450
you're still a prices of those stocks
are still going to be an a reasonably

271
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:18,290
accurate forecast of tomorrow's prices.
So I did one more experiment,

272
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:22,790
or Rashid did one more experiment
for me and Casey, here's this.

273
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,350
In a year, he, uh,

274
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:30,430
he did the same thing on
a portfolio of stocks.

275
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,880
Um, so he looked at a 12
month rolling average.

276
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:38,630
He looked at the stocks that had done
particularly well in the last 12 months

277
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,890
and he bought those.

278
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,040
And then you looked at the stocks that
doesn't particularly badly on the last 12

279
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:47,000
months. And he shorted those. And
here's what his returns would have been,

280
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,380
you know, just taking the daily, you know,

281
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:53,280
thing and just adding it and you'd see
you get almost exactly back to zero.

282
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,820
So this was the original
compelling evidence,

283
00:17:56,821 --> 00:18:01,821
things like this in the
1970s in 1980s led peoples,

284
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:04,920
uh,

285
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:09,920
economist to say that the prices of very
many things seem to be very accurate

286
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:15,420
guides to future prices.
And they called it the rash.

287
00:18:15,421 --> 00:18:17,670
Rationalists loose was
rational expectations.

288
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:27,060
So the high watermark of this theory
was in 1983 I think the most amusing

289
00:18:27,581 --> 00:18:30,950
example was roll Richard
Role, who taught at, uh,

290
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,150
Ucla, uh, and oranges.

291
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,590
So Richard Role did the
following experiment. He said,

292
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,860
it turns out that for
concentrated orange juice,

293
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:47,250
97% of the oranges that are used for
concentrated orange juice are grown on

294
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:50,800
trees that are very close to Orlando,
Florida,

295
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,900
where the weather is pretty much
the same. I mean, it's a small area.

296
00:18:56,901 --> 00:19:00,290
So whatever the weather is,
it's that whether over the whole area.

297
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,890
It's amazing that so many of the
oranges are grown in the same place.

298
00:19:03,891 --> 00:19:06,110
I'm California, I'm talking
about concentrated orange juice.

299
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,520
California is no competition for Florida.
In fact, no competition for Orlando,

300
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:14,450
Florida when it comes to concentrated
orange juice, not oranges in general.

301
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,700
So he said to himself, um, how
good is the market at predicting,

302
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,140
uh,
you know,

303
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,220
the price of orange juice at predicting
next period's price of orange juice.

304
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,350
And he found you don't just like we did
here. It's quite good. But then he said,

305
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:35,000
you know, maybe there's other information
that the market doesn't know about.

306
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,490
And so he said,
what about the weather?

307
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:44,620
So the weather has a tremendous effect
on orange juice prices because if the,

308
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:50,420
if it's a four hours of
freezing temperatures, kills,
starts to kill the trees,

309
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,480
then you'd get less supply of orange.

310
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,720
Orange is for the concentrated orange
juice, and then the price goes up.

311
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:02,060
So he said, you know, since 1970 or so,

312
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:07,780
the u s weather bureau has spent
$250 million building all these,

313
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:15,200
uh, weather forecasting units that
make daily, in fact, they make 36 hour,

314
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:19,730
24 hour and 12 hour forecasts of what
the weather's going to be next period.

315
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,810
So he said, really, if the
market is so good, you know,

316
00:20:23,811 --> 00:20:27,710
and the market price today is really
telling an uninformed investor what the

317
00:20:27,711 --> 00:20:29,120
price ought to be tomorrow.

318
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:33,200
Let me see now by getting a
record of the weather reports,

319
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,520
could I improve on the market price by
putting together today's market price and

320
00:20:37,521 --> 00:20:39,980
the weather report today,
the weather prediction today?

321
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,120
Could I make a better forecast
of the market price tomorrow?

322
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:50,890
Any found out? No.
Statistically the, uh, weather

323
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,680
plus prices does not improve,

324
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:03,160
does not improve, um, price forecast.

325
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,540
Okay. So, I mean, how
can you interpret that?

326
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:12,250
How could that possibly be that knowing
the weather reports dot doesn't help you

327
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:16,750
predict the price better than the next,
the next day than today's price?

328
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:21,050
How could that be?
What's the obvious reason for that?

329
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,933
Yup.

330
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,483
Great.

331
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,610
Right?
So the people buying and selling,

332
00:21:28,611 --> 00:21:31,190
they're also looking at the weather
report. And so naturally they've,

333
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,600
they've taken that into account.

334
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:37,370
But so what it illustrates though is that
all this kind of information that you

335
00:21:37,371 --> 00:21:38,270
might think,
you know,

336
00:21:38,271 --> 00:21:41,840
would go into effecting the value
of the orange juice tomorrow.

337
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:45,200
The market is already processing that
because the people buying and selling,

338
00:21:45,201 --> 00:21:48,590
they're looking at the weather report
and they're figuring out, you know,

339
00:21:48,591 --> 00:21:51,020
what the right, uh, what
the right price should be.

340
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,710
So that was a pretty stunning conclusion,

341
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,650
but he didn't want to stop there.
So what did he do next?

342
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,580
What if you were, you know how in comp
lit, they always say things backwards.

343
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:07,720
The reader is detective or the detective
is reader and you know, every, you know,

344
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:10,330
that's the, anyway, when I
took comp lit, it was always,

345
00:22:10,331 --> 00:22:13,300
that was the gist of every course
was just do everything backwards.

346
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,480
So that's how you knew you were
clever and comp lit. What if,

347
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,940
what would accomplished person have done?
Yes.

348
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,390
He said, okay, let's do, let's use
the price to predict the weather.

349
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:29,950
So He'd said,
suppose the price,

350
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:35,140
uh, today turned out to
be higher than the price.

351
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,610
Okay. So the price from yesterday
to today when unexpectedly up.

352
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,440
Okay. So, um, okay.

353
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:47,290
When unexpectedly up, then he said, okay,

354
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:52,291
that means these market guys were
surprised today to see the price go up.

355
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,600
You know, there's a weather
forecast back here as well,

356
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:00,460
and there's a weather forecast
here. And he said, maybe,

357
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,670
um,
you can now say if the price went up,

358
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,910
can you use that to help
forecast the weather? So he said,

359
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:12,890
suppose that whatever the
forecast is here, you now
say, since the price went up,

360
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,740
we're now going to forecast that the,
the weather guys,

361
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,720
you're the price going up means you're,
you know,

362
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,510
they've learned something here about
the weather probably being bad.

363
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:24,410
So the question is, did the weatherman
learned the same thing? So he says,

364
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,350
let's test the hypothesis
that when the price went up,

365
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,200
these guys learn more about the weather
than the weather prediction Victor's

366
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,750
dead.

367
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,350
So that in fact the actual weather from
this prediction is likely to go down.

368
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,570
Okay. And that's just what
he found. So, um, you can,

369
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,320
you can't use weather to improve
the price prediction of prices,

370
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,980
but you can use prices to improve the
weather prediction of the weather people.

371
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,460
Okay. So that was us. That was, uh,
that was one of the most stunning,

372
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:57,530
a confirmation to the rational
expectations hypothesis. So what,

373
00:23:57,531 --> 00:23:59,930
um, could explain that, by the way,

374
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,400
is that just crazy or an accident or is
there some logical explanation for that?

375
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,323
Yeah,

376
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:14,070
people buying and selling oranges
like no more about the letter

377
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,830
then the government does. So the people
buying and selling oranges, this is,

378
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:22,480
you know, billions of dollars
of, uh, you know, money trade
changing hands. You know,

379
00:24:22,481 --> 00:24:26,800
the government spent $250 million in this
area, you know, forecasting the weather.

380
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:31,180
These guys have billions at stake. They
in fact have better forecasting, better,

381
00:24:31,181 --> 00:24:33,240
better weather forecasting technology.

382
00:24:33,241 --> 00:24:35,590
And then the government does and
they're making better forecasts and the

383
00:24:35,591 --> 00:24:38,140
government isn't the weather.
Okay? So if you asked them,

384
00:24:38,141 --> 00:24:40,960
they would know better than the government
what the weather's going to be the

385
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,990
next day and the price reflects
that. Okay. So that's the,

386
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,930
that's the efficient markets hypothesis,

387
00:24:46,931 --> 00:24:50,140
which seduced many in
the economics profession.

388
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:53,520
And there's still a tremendous amount
of truth to it, at least at the,

389
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,573
at the level.

390
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,970
If you don't know anything and you want
to know something about the future,

391
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,350
look at the prices today,

392
00:24:59,351 --> 00:25:02,680
that's going to tell you a tremendous
amount about the future. Now,

393
00:25:02,681 --> 00:25:07,030
the question is whether it's as
precise as role seems to suggest,

394
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:11,890
and I'm going to, uh, we're going to see
that it's not going to be, but anyway,

395
00:25:11,891 --> 00:25:14,800
for a while, um, these people,

396
00:25:14,801 --> 00:25:18,460
the rational expectations school,
which is mostly at Chicago,

397
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,910
they had the view that in
Pharma was one of the leaders.

398
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:26,500
They had the view that this rational
expectations pricing was the best

399
00:25:26,501 --> 00:25:30,540
documented truth and all of the social
sciences. That's what a Pharma said.

400
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:35,050
So we'll have to come back and see that
that's anyway, not always the case, but,

401
00:25:35,051 --> 00:25:39,670
uh, certainly looks good in these
graphs. Okay. So that's our first, uh,

402
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,130
uh, okay. That's the first idea. Now,

403
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:47,150
the next idea that we looked at was
what is the most important thing

404
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:52,210
to be uncertain? Well, you know, there,

405
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,160
there's output that you're uncertain
about what the next most important thing

406
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,640
is, the discount, the
interest rate after all,

407
00:26:00,641 --> 00:26:03,940
that's the most important variable in
the whole economy according to Fisher.

408
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,570
Who's to say the discount is
always exactly the same thing.

409
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,490
So uncertain discounts.

410
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:14,963
Yeah.

411
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:20,150
Okay. So now we said, and you've done in
the problem set, if the interest rate,

412
00:26:20,151 --> 00:26:23,540
you know,
is 100% and might go up to 200%,

413
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:26,090
say or might go down to 50%,

414
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,120
and now you, uh, now you want to
ask, what's the value of a dollar?

415
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:35,910
Here it's a little subtler. You, um, Eh,

416
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,740
you don't because here the
expectation was all that mattered.

417
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,300
The expectation of the payoffs.

418
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:45,090
If I change this to 106
and I changed this to 96,

419
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,690
I haven't changed.
I haven't changed the expectation.

420
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,550
So the price is going to stay the same.

421
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,270
So the variants has nothing to do
with what the prices, but that's not,

422
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:55,550
but things can get subtler.

423
00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:00,270
Let's suppose that what's changing is the
interest rate. The discount rate. Okay.

424
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:05,070
Now the variance is going to have a big
effect on what the value of things are.

425
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:09,810
So if we think this is happening with 50,
50 probability, the guy, if he, so he,

426
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:12,180
so what do I mean by this model today?

427
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,740
You know that the value of something
tomorrow is going to be a half of what it

428
00:27:16,741 --> 00:27:21,741
pays tomorrow up plus a half what it
pays tomorrow down discounted by 100%

429
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,160
tomorrow.

430
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,670
You're not sure whether you're going to
be discounting at 200% or discounting

431
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:31,671
and 50% so then the value today is going
to be one over one plus 100% times,

432
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,380
okay?
Um,

433
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:43,970
a half times one over one plus 200% of
one plus a half times one over one plus a

434
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,900
50% times one,
okay?

435
00:27:51,901 --> 00:27:55,200
Because over here you know that this
dollar is only going to be worth the third

436
00:27:55,201 --> 00:27:58,500
to you. Over here, you know this
dollar is going to be worth two thirds.

437
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,780
So that's the two thirds here and the
one third here and there's a 50 50 chance

438
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:07,890
of each of these and you're going to
discount it by one over a hundred percent

439
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,400
so that's what the value is to you today.
Okay.

440
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:15,940
So now you did a problem set where you
had to do a bunch of these things. Okay.

441
00:28:15,941 --> 00:28:17,820
And we're going to call that d have to

442
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:23,730
cause that's what you would pay today to
get a dollar for sure at time to in the

443
00:28:23,731 --> 00:28:25,830
future.
And Dee have one,

444
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:31,590
he's going to be just one over
one plus a hundred percent okay.

445
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:33,450
Which is a half.
Okay.

446
00:28:33,451 --> 00:28:36,900
Which is what you would pay today to
get a dollar for sure at time one.

447
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:41,310
And I could compute the of three
and any other d that I wanted to.

448
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,610
Okay, so why, so we're going to see
that interest rate uncertainties,

449
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,180
the most important
uncertainty in the economy,

450
00:28:48,181 --> 00:28:51,810
the value of everything is
going to change. You know,
if the interest rates go up,

451
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,940
all the bonds are going
to go down in value.

452
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,900
All the mortgages are going to change in
value. Although sometimes they don't go,

453
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,380
they go in surprising directions,
but everything's going to change in value.

454
00:29:01,381 --> 00:29:02,760
When the interest rate moves,

455
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:06,120
that's gonna subject everybody
to tremendous amounts of risk.

456
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,150
And we have to figure out how are they
going to cope with all that risk. Well,

457
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:12,810
before we answer that question, we want
to answer the, the simpler question.

458
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,520
How are they going to value things?

459
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,700
And here we just have the
same tree that we had before.

460
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:22,410
So that's what we did last class. And I
just wanted to, to finish that thought,

461
00:29:22,411 --> 00:29:26,520
which I didn't get a chance to do. So
for, for, for period three, you know,

462
00:29:26,521 --> 00:29:31,521
if we could've done a three period thing
and assumed that this went up to 400%

463
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,640
and uh, you know, would
have gone to 100%, um,

464
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:40,980
or down to 25%.
Okay,

465
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,500
then still paid one, one, one. Okay.

466
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:46,450
So that's pay off for a dollar for sure.

467
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:51,220
But now we've got still more uncertainty
in the interest rates. So what's the,

468
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,150
you know,

469
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:55,220
you figured out in the problem set what
the value of that is going to be and you

470
00:29:55,221 --> 00:29:56,950
got d three okay,

471
00:29:56,951 --> 00:30:01,420
so I could have done this for d four
and any other tea that I wanted to.

472
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,590
And in fact that's also what you
did in the, in the problem set.

473
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:07,450
You did it for all the
way up to [inaudible].

474
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,203
Okay.

475
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:10,881
Okay.

476
00:30:10,881 --> 00:30:15,200
So I want now to just say one thing about
the environment before we're going to

477
00:30:15,201 --> 00:30:19,190
come back and analyze this over and over
again to see the risk the whole economy

478
00:30:19,191 --> 00:30:22,430
is exposed to and how people cope with
that risk of interest rates changing.

479
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,420
But I want to make one observation.
These numbers,

480
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:32,110
d one d two d three d four there they
reflect people's attitudes towards the

481
00:30:32,721 --> 00:30:35,450
future. What would you pay today
to get a dollar at time one?

482
00:30:35,451 --> 00:30:37,490
What would you pay today
to get a dollar a time too.

483
00:30:37,491 --> 00:30:39,770
What would you pay today to
get a dollar at a time? Three.

484
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,320
So what does the shape of that function?

485
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:46,040
Well in the case of certainty
with a constant discount rate,

486
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:50,450
that function would have to
decline exponentially. Okay,

487
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:52,340
so it'd be an exponential decline.

488
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,213
Yeah.

489
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,370
Why?
Because it would be,

490
00:31:01,371 --> 00:31:06,371
this would be equal to one over one plus
r and this would be equal to one over

491
00:31:06,621 --> 00:31:11,420
one plus r squared and this would be equal
to one over one plus r to the fourth,

492
00:31:11,421 --> 00:31:15,320
et Cetera.
So after a hundred years or 500 years,

493
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,020
you wouldn't care as long as our is,
you know,

494
00:31:18,021 --> 00:31:21,530
like 0.03 or something
percent quenelle three Rs,

495
00:31:21,531 --> 00:31:25,760
3% as long as there's a number,
like 2% or 3% after 500 years,

496
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:29,630
you just don't care at all about
what's going to happen. The, you know,

497
00:31:29,631 --> 00:31:33,200
if the whole economy and the society is
discounting the future and trading it

498
00:31:33,201 --> 00:31:35,450
off like this,
you don't care at all about the future.

499
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:40,190
So environmental improvements today with
Joan have an effect for 200 years would

500
00:31:40,191 --> 00:31:45,191
be regarded as stupid
ideas and environment.

501
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,160
Mentalist have been trying desperately
to make an argument that 200 years from

502
00:31:49,161 --> 00:31:52,550
now really matters. And so of course
they argue about the interest rate,

503
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:55,550
but really all they're doing is they're
arguing that the interest rate, you know,

504
00:31:55,551 --> 00:32:00,000
instead of being 3% should be 1% or
something like that there, you know, and,

505
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:03,500
and that's not really
helping because even 1%,

506
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,600
if you keep doing that for 500 years,

507
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,530
you're going to get a pretty
trivial number by the end. So, um,

508
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,920
so let me ask you the following question.

509
00:32:12,921 --> 00:32:16,910
Suppose you could have $15 today

510
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,060
or so. This is an experiment. Failure Ran.

511
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,560
He's a behavioral economist.
So next month,

512
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,530
okay.

513
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:33,460
Hey,
one year and 10 years,

514
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:39,870
how much money would you want next month
instead of the $15 today to someone

515
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:44,000
give a number. Just shout out a
number. What seems equivalent to you?

516
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:48,170
20 and it happens to be
exactly what the average,

517
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,900
I don't know if you
read my that's exactly.

518
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:53,270
Do you know of a sailor experiment
or it's precisely the average.

519
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,980
Thaler did a class like this, averaged
all the numbers. He got 20. Amazingly.

520
00:32:57,981 --> 00:33:01,370
What about for one year?
What would you say?

521
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:09,750
50 to 100. Okay. And what about 10 years?

522
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,493
200

523
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,980
okay,
so I'll tell you the Fayler numbers.

524
00:33:15,981 --> 00:33:20,180
I stupidly forgot them all when it Turkey.
Um,

525
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:26,800
okay,
so the numbers of Thaler.

526
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,353
Yeah.

527
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,450
Okay.
So let's just go with those numbers.

528
00:33:33,451 --> 00:33:37,940
But what do you think about
those numbers? Okay, so Thaler,

529
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:42,880
God.
Okay,

530
00:33:42,881 --> 00:33:44,470
so it's amazing.

531
00:33:44,471 --> 00:33:48,910
Fayler got 2050 and a
hundred were sailors numbers.

532
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,950
So very close to what you're telling me.

533
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,600
50 and a hundred so what's
the matter with those numbers?

534
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:01,480
Let's go with failers. They weren't
that different from yours. Okay. What,

535
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,970
what's the problem with failers numbers?

536
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:11,950
What?
Yeah,

537
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,580
rapidly, rapidly. This is just one month.

538
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:21,040
You have to have a huge discount to care,
but you know,

539
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:24,250
this is your discounting by
33% or something a month.

540
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,690
So tremendous discount to go from
here to here. If he did that 12 times,

541
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,790
you would have gotten a tight.

542
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,680
So if you look at the monthly
discount rate from here to here,

543
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:36,670
you know you get like 33% from
here to here. It's to the 12 power.

544
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,000
So you're just counting, but
you know, 5% from here to here.

545
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,340
You've got to the hundred 20th power.

546
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:47,230
So what number to the hundred 20th
gives you, you know, six and two thirds,

547
00:34:47,231 --> 00:34:50,020
not a very big number. In fact, you know,

548
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:54,990
the reciprocal of that number
is the discount is 0.75 is,

549
00:34:54,991 --> 00:34:57,820
is he a 0.75 to the one?
Okay,

550
00:34:57,821 --> 00:35:00,370
so this is 0.75 obviously,

551
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,500
and then 15 over 50 to the one 10th.
Okay.

552
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:09,160
One 12 is point. Um, you know,

553
00:35:09,161 --> 00:35:13,660
it was 0.9 and then 15 over
100 to the one 20th this 0.98.

554
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,120
Okay. So you're discounting
by 33%, you know,

555
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,230
something like that by 10% and then by 2%.

556
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,630
So your discount rate is falling rapidly.

557
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:29,603
Oh,

558
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,070
you do experiments with, with uh,
animals. You get the same conclusion.

559
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:38,020
You asked the animals,
you know, how, you know,

560
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:42,270
you can make an animal work and then
they'll have to wait a certain time to get

561
00:35:42,271 --> 00:35:45,630
the food. Or if they, you
know, uh, work harder,

562
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,080
they can get more food, but they have
to wait a certain amount of, you know,

563
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:51,780
longer amount of time.
So you try and do the experiment.

564
00:35:51,781 --> 00:35:54,660
I'm not sure these actually a, you
know, are believable. But anyway,

565
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,740
they do these experiments and they, they
figure out how much the animal is trait.

566
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:03,120
You know, these are birds and mice and
all kinds of things trading off waiting,

567
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:06,480
um, you know, for getting a bigger
reward and they get the similar,

568
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:09,690
similar kinds of numbers to what
Taylor got by talking to a psychologic,

569
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,470
you know, psychological experiments
with, with real people. Well,

570
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:16,500
how can you explain it in the
world of constant discounting?

571
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,150
You couldn't possibly explain it.

572
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:21,780
Now of course you could explain it by
saying everybody's discount rate is going

573
00:36:21,781 --> 00:36:23,790
to get smaller and smaller over time.

574
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:27,941
Okay.

575
00:36:27,941 --> 00:36:32,620
But that their annual discount rate is
getting smaller and smaller over time.

576
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:37,540
But that's totally unbelievable. You know,
and it's just, you know, why should you,

577
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:41,560
you know, that a year from now if you
were asked the same kinds of questions,

578
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,330
you'd give the same kind of answers.

579
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:47,740
So your discount between today and next
month is going to be the same next year

580
00:36:47,741 --> 00:36:49,720
as it is now.
Okay.

581
00:36:49,721 --> 00:36:53,200
So it's not the case that the one month
this count and you don't happens to be

582
00:36:53,201 --> 00:36:54,460
high now because you're,
you know,

583
00:36:54,461 --> 00:36:56,980
you're in college and then the
day you got out of college,

584
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:58,000
you're going to be more mature.

585
00:36:58,001 --> 00:37:00,520
And so you're going to have a smaller
discount rate. When you get to my age,

586
00:37:00,521 --> 00:37:02,830
you're going to be even more mature
and have a smaller discount rate.

587
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,250
That doesn't happen. The discount rate
doesn't go down like that. In fact,

588
00:37:06,251 --> 00:37:08,230
if anything, I don't, if
you're rational out to go up,

589
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:11,170
I'm closer to death than you are and
you're off. I don't get this stuff now.

590
00:37:11,171 --> 00:37:13,990
Who knows when I'll ever get it.
So the discount rate should be going up,

591
00:37:13,991 --> 00:37:17,890
not going down. And yet it
seems like there's so much
evidence that it goes down.

592
00:37:17,891 --> 00:37:21,670
So this is a big puzzle,
uh, in, in, in economics.

593
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:26,470
So I just offer, again, I got to make
it a habit now of offering theories.

594
00:37:26,471 --> 00:37:27,850
I'm not saying this is the right theory,

595
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,950
I'm just simply pointing out that if you
had this, uh, random discount, you know,

596
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:36,580
put uncertainty into the discount,
put uncertainty into the interest rates,

597
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,030
you know, uncertain in the interest
rates is the heart of finance.

598
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,980
Every single person, every single
series finance person, um, thinks about,

599
00:37:44,981 --> 00:37:49,330
ran, you know, the uh, um, what do
you call it? Uncertain, you know,

600
00:37:49,331 --> 00:37:51,100
variability in interest rates.

601
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:55,570
And so I take the simplest
possible process when the
interest rates can go up or

602
00:37:55,571 --> 00:37:59,100
down by the same percentage.
So for example, by four start,

603
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:03,190
you could start at 4% and then the,
the uh,

604
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:08,680
you know, the variation or the
standard deviation, it could be 16%.

605
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:09,600
Okay.

606
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:14,600
Which means that 4% basically goes to
4% times 1.16 or to 4% times divided by

607
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:19,360
1.16.
That process

608
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:25,390
actually either the one times e to the
0.16 or a times e to the minus 0.16,

609
00:38:25,391 --> 00:38:27,790
which is very close to times 1.16.

610
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:31,930
That geometric random walk is
the basic model of finance.

611
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:36,850
And what you found in your homework is
you're supposed to find that as you go

612
00:38:36,851 --> 00:38:39,880
out further and further,
the effect of discount rate does go down.

613
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,310
And what I forgot to say,
the punchline is, if you've,

614
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:45,400
if failers numbers here,

615
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:48,730
confirm what all the
behavioral economists suggests,

616
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:53,320
which is that there's hyperbolic
discounting, hyperbolic discounting.

617
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,970
So what they do,

618
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:58,860
what they confirm in these
experiments is that if this is DFT,

619
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:04,810
this should go down like a
tea to some power, you know,

620
00:39:04,811 --> 00:39:09,320
t to the, you know, t to the, um,

621
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,960
minus some power to you,

622
00:39:10,961 --> 00:39:14,890
the minus two or t to the minus a half or
something like that. They get, you know,

623
00:39:14,891 --> 00:39:17,290
some, you know, they don't
pin down with this numbers,

624
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,520
but t to the minus say so it
goes down much slower than,

625
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,990
than she was I just much slower than
the exponent, which is, you know,

626
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:33,910
some exponent like 0.9 to the t that
goes down much faster than that does.

627
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,940
This is a polynomial and,
t this is an exponential and t,

628
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,740
so it's going down much faster.

629
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:43,390
So this is a classic failers numbers
are a classic polynomial. In fact,

630
00:39:43,391 --> 00:39:48,040
with exponent, a half
failers numbers fit tea, uh,

631
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:51,190
to minus a half if you do
the right starting point.

632
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:56,470
So what did I show?
I show that any geometric random walk,

633
00:39:56,471 --> 00:40:00,040
no matter where you start, no matter what
our zero has, no matter what you start,

634
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,350
no matter what standard
deviation you'll go.

635
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,330
If you figure out the sequence of numbers,

636
00:40:04,331 --> 00:40:07,900
d one d two d three d
four not up to 30 years,

637
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:10,510
which is where everybody else
stopped because bonds into 30 years,

638
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,640
but you do it for a hundred or 200 or
500 d of t is always eventually going to

639
00:40:16,301 --> 00:40:20,200
be equal to some constant
times 10 to the minus a half.

640
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:23,230
Exactly.
Consistent with failers numbers.

641
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,740
So I don't know if that's the
explanation to hyperbolic discounting,

642
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:30,640
but I thought it was pretty interesting
and anyone could have done it if they

643
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:33,880
just didn't stop at 30 years.
Just kept going.

644
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:37,300
And then there's some mathematics too.
You know, you can compute examples,

645
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,480
but there's some mathematics to
prove that asks them topically.

646
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:45,130
That's the right formula.
Okay. So in fact,

647
00:40:45,131 --> 00:40:49,390
in this paper I wrote this with a
coauthor dome farmer whose daughter is a

648
00:40:49,391 --> 00:40:52,810
sophomore here and his son just
graduated by the way, he's in Santa Fe.

649
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:58,260
And so if you look at the picture here,

650
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,910
you can see that this exponent,

651
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,870
these are the d of t's when
you exponentially discount,

652
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:08,560
I've got it on a logarithmic scale.
So if you exponentially discount things,

653
00:41:08,561 --> 00:41:13,030
go the ds drop off really fast,
that's the dotted line really fast.

654
00:41:13,031 --> 00:41:15,610
But if you do this random thing,

655
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,470
you get the thing that goes much slower
and it goes with a slope of minus a half.

656
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:24,100
So let's just, since I plotted things on
log scale, that's just what this means.

657
00:41:24,101 --> 00:41:27,280
Taking the log of this, you get a
straight line with slope minus a half.

658
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:30,070
And that's just what we
found. And we, you know,

659
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,340
manage to prove that that always has to
happen. Okay? So if you look, you know,

660
00:41:34,341 --> 00:41:36,560
500 years in the future,

661
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:41,561
you start with 4% and you
assume a constant discount
rate after 500 years in the

662
00:41:42,591 --> 00:41:47,340
exponential, nobody could possibly care
about 500 years from now. But you know,

663
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:52,310
500 years from now was 1% as
important as now if you, um,

664
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,190
discount at this, you
know, if you start out,

665
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:58,070
if everyone knows the interest rates
4% now and it's going to go up or down,

666
00:41:58,071 --> 00:42:02,120
keep going forever.
So it's a quite shocking.

667
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,390
Okay, so that's the, that's it.

668
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:08,680
So we're gonna come back over and over
again to this and this is the yield curve

669
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,810
that you would get the
zero yield per like,

670
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:15,260
and the problem set goes up and then
starts coming back there. All right.

671
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,660
Does anyone want to say anything about
discounting or how to compute this stuff?

672
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,340
Do you know how I did this?
Yes.

673
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,310
Yeah. Um, okay. So the, the immune,

674
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,290
the intuition of why that ha you
computed it new. Found it happen. Okay.

675
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:37,120
What's the intuition?
The intuition is that,

676
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:42,770
so why should this thing,
okay,

677
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:46,820
go up and then go down just like you
competed in the problem that the reason is

678
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,600
because if the, if the, uh,

679
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,000
interest rate is moving in
a geometric random walk.

680
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:57,140
So it's doubling or getting multiplied
by a half, the geometric average is,

681
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:58,850
it stays where it was before.

682
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,750
But that means since the
arithmetic average is always
bigger than the geometric

683
00:43:02,751 --> 00:43:03,231
average,

684
00:43:03,231 --> 00:43:08,231
the arithmetic average of 200% and
50% is actually bigger than a 100%.

685
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,270
So at the beginning you're sort of,

686
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:14,210
you're going to be doing this geometric,

687
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:18,140
this arithmetic average and things are
going to be getting bigger for a while,

688
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:23,060
but when you go out farther and
farther, why doesn't that matter? Okay,

689
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:24,560
so what is the intuition?

690
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:26,190
Yeah,

691
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:26,941
and,
and by the way,

692
00:43:26,941 --> 00:43:31,710
this is a common thing and finance with
someone named Weitzman who was at Yale,

693
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,950
announce at Harvard, um, did, uh,

694
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:39,060
suggest this idea in economics.
He said, for the environment,

695
00:43:39,061 --> 00:43:42,210
you should always use the lowest
possible interest rate. And why is that?

696
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:43,350
Let's do an example.

697
00:43:43,351 --> 00:43:47,880
Suppose the interest rate was
going to go to 100% one over.

698
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:51,630
So you're going to multiply by one over
two and then keep multiplying by one

699
00:43:51,631 --> 00:43:54,120
over two forever.
Interest rates stayed the same.

700
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,810
Or let's say you were going to mop,

701
00:43:55,990 --> 00:44:00,320
the interest rate was going to be a less
discounting to over three and was going

702
00:44:00,321 --> 00:44:04,000
to stay there forever.
Okay.

703
00:44:04,001 --> 00:44:05,410
And you get one here or one here.

704
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:10,360
So I'm doing a very simple case where 50%
of the time it stays at a 100% forever

705
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:15,630
and 50% of the time it goes to 50% this
is 100% and this is 50% Brian is the

706
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:21,340
interest rate stays at 100% forever
or 50% forever. So you discount,

707
00:44:21,341 --> 00:44:24,250
you multiply by two thirds forever or,
or by a half forever.

708
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:27,250
So this could happen with probability
a half and this could happen with

709
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:32,251
probability a half if you average
this multiplied all the haves and this

710
00:44:32,761 --> 00:44:35,700
multiplied by all the thirds,
by the all the two thirds,

711
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:40,260
the half is irrelevant because this is
such a tiny number compared to this one,

712
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:40,501
right?

713
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:44,670
Because every time you're multiplying by
such a small number up here compared to

714
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:49,290
this, this thing just is negligible
compared to this. So really the, the, the,

715
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:53,520
the total here is entirely given
by what happened down here. Okay?

716
00:44:53,521 --> 00:44:58,380
So it's two thirds to the nth power times
one plus a totally negligible thing.

717
00:44:59,100 --> 00:44:59,610
Okay?

718
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:04,610
So you're going to have half of this
value is going to be the value here.

719
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:08,490
So the high interest rate, the hundred
percent interest rate didn't matter.

720
00:45:08,491 --> 00:45:11,370
It's only the low interest rates
that matter. So why is that?

721
00:45:11,371 --> 00:45:15,390
Because of the random walk and when you
follow a random walk it goes like that.

722
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:20,160
So if you end up with a really
low interest rate at the end,

723
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:24,480
so here we start with 4% by the end,
you know,

724
00:45:24,481 --> 00:45:25,390
cause it's a random walk,

725
00:45:25,391 --> 00:45:27,390
you don't know where the final
interest rate's going to be.

726
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,150
It's going to be some normally
distributed thing like that.

727
00:45:30,151 --> 00:45:31,950
You know what the final
interest rate's going to be.

728
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:35,460
But the low interest
rates here at the end,

729
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:41,160
here's where the interest rate was the
same as where you started back to 4% so

730
00:45:41,161 --> 00:45:43,620
I'm not saying that people
typically go down here.

731
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,120
That would be a ridiculous assumption.

732
00:45:45,121 --> 00:45:47,700
I'm saying on average they're at
the same level they were today,

733
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:53,040
but the past where the interest rate
ends up high probably were high the whole

734
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:56,700
way along. So they kept getting discounted
so they don't make any difference.

735
00:45:56,701 --> 00:46:00,840
The pads with the interest rate went was
low path was probably low the whole way

736
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:04,320
along. And that's why those are
much more relevant past the knees.

737
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,630
So when you take your average to get it,

738
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:11,130
it's going to be in this particular
example though, as if it was two thirds,

739
00:46:11,131 --> 00:46:15,400
50% discounting forever. But of course
we're only averaging over these low pass.

740
00:46:15,401 --> 00:46:18,750
So I have to put a half in front of it.
That's why it's not 10 to the minus half.

741
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:23,800
It's an ae times t to the minus half.
Okay.

742
00:46:23,801 --> 00:46:28,320
So that's the, okay, so
that's what vague intuition,

743
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:31,060
but it maybe helps a little bit
figuring out why that happens. Okay.

744
00:46:31,061 --> 00:46:34,360
So I don't know, this may have some
significance for the environment.

745
00:46:34,361 --> 00:46:37,510
So I personally think that we should
do something about the environment,

746
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,550
even if it's only gonna be 500 years away,

747
00:46:39,551 --> 00:46:42,280
I don't think we should just discount it
to zero because the interest rates are

748
00:46:42,281 --> 00:46:46,900
4% and 4% of the 500th
power is some tiny number

749
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:53,800
that is one over 1.04 to some
500th power is a tiny number. Okay,

750
00:46:53,801 --> 00:46:56,200
so I'm going to march on
now there are no questions.

751
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:01,380
What's the next most important kind of
uncertainty that you see in the market?

752
00:47:01,661 --> 00:47:02,494
All the time.

753
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:05,050
Okay.

754
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:06,550
It's the chance of default.

755
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:15,430
Now we're going to see very shortly that
default and the possibility of default

756
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,390
changes a lot of things.

757
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:22,750
But you could still be
irrational expectations guy
and believe that the fault is

758
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:26,930
just, it's no big deal.
It's just that the payoff,

759
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:32,140
which over here was 104 and 98 the
fall just makes the payoff lower.

760
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,870
So what's the typical thing
that the faults, it's a bond.

761
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:38,613
So

762
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:44,970
they would go thing
that default is a bond.

763
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,650
So suppose I had,

764
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:58,540
suppose I had a one
year bond from Argentina

765
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:01,670
that could pay a hundred

766
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:06,230
or it could pay zero is Argentine bond.

767
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,270
So you'll have to forgive me if you're
from Argentina and then we have the

768
00:48:11,271 --> 00:48:16,130
American bond that can pay a
hundred or I can pay a hundred

769
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,450
okay,
so,

770
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,380
well I might the RJ. Okay, so what do
you see if you look at American bonds,

771
00:48:27,381 --> 00:48:30,390
so these both promise a
hundred the American bond,

772
00:48:30,391 --> 00:48:31,710
if you look at the market today,

773
00:48:31,711 --> 00:48:35,310
is going to sell for a higher price
in the Argentine bond. Why is that?

774
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:40,230
Because people assume that the American
bond is not going to default. Okay?

775
00:48:40,231 --> 00:48:41,850
So even if you put a zero here,

776
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:45,750
they assume that the probability for
the American bond is one here and the

777
00:48:45,751 --> 00:48:47,960
probability, the Argentine bond, you know,

778
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:51,180
is some number 0.8 or 0.2 or something.

779
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:53,310
Question is what's the
number that they put there?

780
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:58,020
But so there's uncertainty
about defaulting and if
defaulting means paying zero,

781
00:48:58,021 --> 00:48:59,910
we're going to think a second
about what it really means.

782
00:48:59,911 --> 00:49:02,100
If it means paying zero,
that's no big deal.

783
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:05,760
We just in calculating the expected payoff
we have to take into account and not

784
00:49:05,761 --> 00:49:08,550
the usual dividends and all that stuff,
plus a hundred.

785
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:12,450
We also have to take into account
the possibility things to fall. Okay.

786
00:49:12,451 --> 00:49:16,790
So let's, let's, uh,

787
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:18,840
look at some of those curves.

788
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,333
Hmm.

789
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,003
Oh No.

790
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:30,660
Oh No.

791
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:36,010
Did I forget the curves?
All right, hang on.

792
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,590
So I got another one on mine.

793
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:39,063
MMM.

794
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,640
Oh dear. I got another one of my, uh,

795
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:52,160
you think I'm on the Internet
in here by the way? No.

796
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:56,220
Oh, I didn't realize this would
happen when I lost the Internet.

797
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,270
I had opened the file, but it doesn't, uh,

798
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,033
okay.

799
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:03,950
Yes. Okay. It's only, take a second.

800
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:08,930
Yeah.
All wireless

801
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:25,420
connection successful.
Okay. So I can close this

802
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,530
and now I,

803
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,790
all right, sorry. It only take one more
second. I beg your pardon for this.

804
00:50:39,791 --> 00:50:43,630
I had it,
it disappeared when I walked over here.

805
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:47,950
Okay. So what, so it's going to take a
second for me to get on the Internet.

806
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,390
So what could we do here?

807
00:50:49,391 --> 00:50:52,420
We could figure out what the
price of the Argentine bond was.

808
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:57,570
So suppose the price of the Argentine
bond is 80 and the price of the American

809
00:50:58,481 --> 00:51:02,860
bond is 95 is a 95

810
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,060
okay.

811
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,500
Okay.
What do you think,

812
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:13,020
what do you think are w w w what does
the market think the chance of Argentina

813
00:51:13,021 --> 00:51:15,420
defaulting is?
How would you figure that out?

814
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,790
So it's right d here
and one minus the here.

815
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:24,030
So you don't know anything about
Argentina. You know, it's a great country.

816
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:28,890
They have, you know, wonderful
everything, music, beautiful people,

817
00:51:28,891 --> 00:51:31,980
everything, you know. Okay.

818
00:51:31,981 --> 00:51:35,460
But their bonds happened to sell for
a lower price than American bonds do.

819
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:38,340
So assuming the American
bonds can't the fault,

820
00:51:38,341 --> 00:51:42,270
because we're just going to print the
money and Argentina might default because

821
00:51:42,271 --> 00:51:44,460
maybe they've tied their
payments to the dollars,

822
00:51:44,461 --> 00:51:47,760
so they can't just print the money.
What do you think d is?

823
00:51:47,761 --> 00:51:49,260
How can you figure out what the is?

824
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:58,310
Oh, that's bad. Oh dear.

825
00:51:59,030 --> 00:51:59,863
Well,

826
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:08,270
so you know, in my Yale Mail, this
all goes to junk. But in the on there,

827
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:12,530
this is really bad.
You'll have to cut that out.

828
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:18,720
Oh No. Uh, oh no.

829
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,090
You can't infer anything from that.

830
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:26,733
Oh,

831
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,850
okay.
So here is the,

832
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,793
mmm,

833
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:39,960
let's do JP Morgan.

834
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:50,400
Oh, what a disaster. Um, okay, so this,

835
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:52,860
so, okay, so let's, where
did I get that graph?

836
00:52:52,861 --> 00:52:54,450
Let's just do this problem for the art.

837
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:58,050
So this is j p Morgan and this
is the chance of defaulting.

838
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:00,570
So you see that or know this JP Morgan,

839
00:53:00,571 --> 00:53:04,200
what are the chances that after one year
JP Morgan's going to go out of business?

840
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:07,590
The market thinks it's surprisingly high.
A percent and a half.

841
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,650
I should have asked you what
you thought after 10 years.

842
00:53:10,651 --> 00:53:14,640
They think that JP Morgan,
you know the, the, the leader,
the Great Investment Bank,

843
00:53:14,641 --> 00:53:16,800
which is now a real
regular bank and you know,

844
00:53:16,801 --> 00:53:20,880
the most successful that they think
10% the market thinks it will be out of

845
00:53:20,881 --> 00:53:24,900
business within 10 years.
Okay. So how did we,

846
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,250
how to get that number? Well, let's,
you know, and we can do another one.

847
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:34,200
We can do Citibank.
Citibank is a totally lousy American Bang.

848
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,600
That ought to have gone
out of business already,

849
00:53:36,601 --> 00:53:39,240
but it's being propped
up by the government. So,

850
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,000
of course people think the government's
going to keep it propped up.

851
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:46,830
So over a year it's actually got a
smaller probability or about the same

852
00:53:46,831 --> 00:53:50,580
probability as JP Morgan because everybody
knows the government's going to keep

853
00:53:50,581 --> 00:53:52,140
propping it up.
But then you know,

854
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:56,100
eventually maybe the government's gonna
stop worrying about Gee, about Citibank.

855
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:59,160
And so after 10 years,
Citibank, the biggest,

856
00:53:59,161 --> 00:54:03,600
what used to be the biggest bank in the
world has got a 25% chance of going out

857
00:54:03,601 --> 00:54:07,080
of business. 25% that won't
even say 20 years. Yeah,

858
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:12,000
25% it won't even be here. Okay. So
how did I know what those numbers were?

859
00:54:12,001 --> 00:54:15,360
How did the Ellington
trader figure that out?

860
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:19,500
Every morning they figure out the interest
rates and they figure out the implied

861
00:54:19,501 --> 00:54:22,740
default probabilities. So what is
the implied default probability,

862
00:54:22,741 --> 00:54:27,060
this Argentine bond,
how would you figure that out?

863
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:32,760
Well, according to our theory, what
is the price of the origin team bond

864
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:37,580
80 what should I write that equal to

865
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,193
what?

866
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,210
Okay,
one minus d times what?

867
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,073
Okay.

868
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:54,550
Okay. Well that's very good. So,
let me just see how she, lets,

869
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:58,630
so where are you? Okay,
excellent. But you went too fast.

870
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:01,570
You've got the right answer,
but it was just very fast. Okay?

871
00:55:01,571 --> 00:55:06,100
So it's one that the payoff
of the Argentine behind is
one mine in Steve Times a

872
00:55:06,101 --> 00:55:10,540
hundred plus d times zero. Okay?
So that's the expected payoff.

873
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:13,930
That's what you expect to happen here.
But she went,

874
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:18,790
so she not only did that, but she
went one step further and she said,

875
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:23,290
how would you, um, how would you,

876
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:27,850
uh, you have to discount it. So how does
she know how much to discount it? Well,

877
00:55:27,851 --> 00:55:31,630
you could buy an American bond
just as well as an Argentine bond.

878
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:34,350
So basically we know that the
discount, right? The world discount,

879
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,850
everybody has the Argentines
can buy the American bonds.

880
00:55:36,851 --> 00:55:41,090
And so $100 for sure is worth 95.
So here's the excel.

881
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,400
According to our hypothesis,

882
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:46,360
you take the expected payoff and
then multiplied by the discount,

883
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:49,500
95 over a hundred.
So that's equal justice.

884
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:52,720
She said to one minus D turns 95.

885
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:55,600
That's what she said as
she was exactly right.

886
00:55:55,870 --> 00:56:00,870
So therefore you can figure out
that one minus D is 80 over 95.

887
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,090
Okay.
And so d is

888
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:10,100
one minus 80, over 95.
Okay. Which is, you know,

889
00:56:10,101 --> 00:56:11,540
something like 15%,

890
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:17,620
a little bit more, maybe it's
16%, something like that.

891
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:22,710
So it looks like there's a chance
of 16% that Argentina is to default.

892
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:27,713
Yeah.

893
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:32,130
So that's how they figured out.
Um,

894
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:36,660
that's how they figured out what
all these default probabilities are.

895
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:39,810
Any questions about that?

896
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:46,740
Let's see if we could do a
two period version. Okay. So
they've done one one year.

897
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:49,230
Now I'm not going to show
you what Argentina is.

898
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:53,400
Last year I got to show everybody
what Argentina was. Unfortunately,

899
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:56,760
my hedge funds,
emerging market

900
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:03,640
trade or one out of business last year
on the crisis lost a lot of money.

901
00:57:03,781 --> 00:57:08,130
So we closed it down. So I
can't show you what, uh, are.

902
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:12,750
Um, so I don't have, it's too complicated
and why I didn't bother to get all the,

903
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:17,400
all the, uh, you know, countries,
uh, prices on the default curves.

904
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:21,010
You don't bother to compute them anymore
because we're not training them all

905
00:57:21,011 --> 00:57:25,560
right now. But we still are trading
all these potential corporate bonds.

906
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:30,660
All right?
Suppose it was two years

907
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:36,630
old. We had a two year
thing. So this is the u s

908
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,553
okay.

909
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:43,950
Okay.

910
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:48,950
Now I'm going to do a simplified version
first and then we're going to have to

911
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,830
complicated.
Um,

912
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:00,263
okay.

913
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:04,620
Okay.
So I guess I'm assuming that we're doing

914
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:10,063
okay.

915
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:15,550
Okay. So let's do the case
where we're doing zeroes. Okay.

916
00:58:15,551 --> 00:58:19,750
So it's a here's America
and hearings Argentina,

917
00:58:19,751 --> 00:58:21,730
and we're just going to be trading zeros.
Okay?

918
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:25,090
So it's going to get a little
more complicated with, um,

919
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:28,720
when their dividends,
but not so much cause it's complicated.

920
00:58:28,721 --> 00:58:29,800
So there's a two year.

921
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:41,230
Okay? So those curves should be
parallels. So here's Argentina.

922
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,720
Now let's say that the American,

923
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:47,580
so here we've got the one
year bond pays off in the um,

924
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:54,130
um, yellow. So one one here,

925
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:55,960
and let's assume it doesn't really matter,

926
00:58:55,961 --> 00:58:58,930
but let's assume that that price is 0.9

927
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:04,890
and then the zero, the two
years here in America, which
pays off one, one, one here.

928
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,100
It's all, just write that
in pink one, one, one.

929
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:11,253
Okay.

930
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:16,430
Hey, is worth 70. What did I do? 72.

931
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:20,810
Okay, now let's do the same thing in
Argentina. Let's say the one year bond,

932
00:59:20,811 --> 00:59:24,650
which off one here and zero
there, okay, this is the fault.

933
00:59:24,651 --> 00:59:26,150
So it's probability d,

934
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:33,570
Let's say the probability of
DIYs always the same, okay? Um,

935
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,790
the one year Argentine bond,

936
00:59:35,791 --> 00:59:40,080
let's say is worth 0.7 is worth 0.54

937
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:48,460
and the two year is two one six. Let's
say. So now, what is the two year?

938
00:59:48,461 --> 00:59:50,230
So we have to look at these paths.

939
00:59:50,231 --> 00:59:54,460
What is the two year Argentine bond going
to be worth? It will be worth one here,

940
00:59:55,930 --> 01:00:00,100
zero here. But now if the one
year Argentine bond defaults,

941
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:01,330
it's the same country.

942
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:03,730
So they've gone out of business and
aren't going to pay their one year.

943
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:05,650
They're not going to pay
their two year either.

944
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:10,780
So it's going to be zero here in here.
So let's assume that's the payoff. Okay?

945
01:00:10,781 --> 01:00:15,070
So here we know that the one
year American bond is 90 cents.

946
01:00:15,130 --> 01:00:16,150
The one year zero,

947
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:21,360
the two year American zero 72
cents and the one year Argentine,

948
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:24,150
uh, zero is 50. What did I say?

949
01:00:24,151 --> 01:00:28,840
54 and the two years is 21.6 cents.

950
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:34,660
Okay, so how are we going to figure
out what these uh, and, and, and why?

951
01:00:34,661 --> 01:00:36,340
Assume the same default probability.

952
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:40,090
I think I'd make it more interesting
and assume d one and d two after all.

953
01:00:40,091 --> 01:00:43,420
And those curves that
changes d one and D two.

954
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,940
Okay, so [inaudible] is
actually quite irrelevant there.

955
01:00:48,941 --> 01:00:53,260
So what? Um, okay, so this doesn't
matter. So we've just got D two.

956
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:59,510
Okay. So solving for d one is going
to give me, all right, so what do I,

957
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:03,980
what do I do now?
How would I solve this?

958
01:01:03,981 --> 01:01:05,060
What do you think I should do?

959
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:11,570
How do I get the one in d two?
Which would I saw four first.

960
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:21,360
The
one,

961
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,800
this is probably one here,
one here or it doesn't matter.

962
01:01:30,801 --> 01:01:33,410
You go call them on ones.
So in fact,

963
01:01:33,411 --> 01:01:37,340
let's put in the same tree and
call this one minus day one.

964
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:39,710
And this is one minus d two.

965
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:44,740
This is Argentina defaulting
or not defaulting and
America still going have the

966
01:01:44,961 --> 01:01:48,710
u s bond is still going to pay what it's
promised, no matter whether Argentina.

967
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:51,260
So this is the Argentina tree
and this is the Americans,

968
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:55,610
the same tree with the American payoffs
over on the right on the bottom tree,

969
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:59,540
but it's the same tree on top of that one.
So how would I fit?

970
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:01,550
Which would I get first?
Do you want her d two

971
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:03,820
okay,

972
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:04,780
the one.
Okay,

973
01:02:04,781 --> 01:02:09,781
so I know that one minus Dijuan times one.

974
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:13,083
Okay,

975
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:17,860
that's there plus d one times zero.

976
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:22,140
That's the expected payoff of
the one year. Argentine bond

977
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:27,783
times what

978
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:32,900
equals a 0.54

979
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:38,330
is that, is that how I should solve
for Dijuan or am I missing something?

980
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:43,310
Point nine you have to
discount it by 0.9 okay,

981
01:02:43,311 --> 01:02:48,170
so then we could solve very easily,
we would get one minus d one

982
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:54,760
one minus Dijuan equals
0.54 over 0.9 right,

983
01:02:55,431 --> 01:02:56,690
because this is just zero.

984
01:02:56,691 --> 01:03:00,230
So I just wrote one minus is one over
here and I divided the 0.9 there.

985
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:05,210
That happens to work out very nicely
to 60% so we know that the chance of

986
01:03:05,211 --> 01:03:09,320
default is 40% in the first year.

987
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:13,120
Okay. Now what's the chance
of default in the second year,

988
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:16,240
assuming you haven't defaulted
already in the first year,

989
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:20,520
if you defaulted in the first year,
you've wiped out everything anyway. Uh,

990
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:25,340
including the two year zero. So what,
what should I write now to get beat too?

991
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:34,430
Well, with probability, um,

992
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,800
the only way to get paid is to go up here.

993
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:39,800
So I'd have to go one minus d one

994
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:43,880
times one minus d two

995
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:51,420
times one.
That's the only way to get any money.

996
01:03:51,421 --> 01:03:54,000
The rest isn't paying me anything.
Times what?

997
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:05,990
All right, ms what? I'm sorry. Times what?

998
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:09,570
Didn't hear it. Point seven
two yes. I don't know.

999
01:04:09,571 --> 01:04:13,920
I sounded like one 17 0.72 that didn't
make any sense. One 17th all right,

1000
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:19,160
so 0.72 exactly is going to equal 0.216.

1001
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:21,451
Okay.

1002
01:04:21,451 --> 01:04:26,451
So now all I have to do is I have to
realize that a one minus d two a equals

1003
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:33,980
0.216 over 0.72 m w times
one over one minus d one.

1004
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:41,190
Okay? So that happens to be, um,

1005
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:43,560
0.3 is it happens to be,

1006
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:44,570
okay

1007
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:49,570
0.3 I guess 0.3 times one over one minus
d one we just got that was 0.6 over 0.6

1008
01:04:52,971 --> 01:04:54,980
which equals um,

1009
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:59,380
0.51

1010
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:03,400
minus d one we saw was 0.6.
I've got a 0.6 down here and this over,

1011
01:05:03,401 --> 01:05:07,120
this is 0.3 so it's 0.3
or 1.6 which is just 0.5.

1012
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:12,300
So we now know that this
probability is 0.55 d 2.5 so,

1013
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,800
so 50% I could,
right.

1014
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:26,110
Okay. So actually it's quite interesting.
We know that the probability,

1015
01:05:26,111 --> 01:05:30,640
I wonder whether this was cumulative
default must be cumulative default.

1016
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:35,050
So we know that um, things are
getting worse. In Argentina.

1017
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:38,020
The first year,
there's a 40% chance of default.

1018
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:40,570
But even if you get through
the first year, the next year,

1019
01:05:40,571 --> 01:05:43,570
there's going to be a 50%
chance of default. Okay.

1020
01:05:43,571 --> 01:05:48,220
So things are getting worse and worse and
worse in Argentina. Uh, in this example,

1021
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:52,420
I'm not saying in real life in this
example, okay. But by doing this, uh, for,

1022
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:57,500
for any bond of any
corporation or any country,

1023
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,690
you can learn a lot about what the,
what the market thinks about that country.

1024
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:05,380
So the market doesn't think very much of,
of a,

1025
01:06:05,381 --> 01:06:08,430
Citibank could think Citibank in
10 years, could have, you know,

1026
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:12,550
25% chance of going out of business.
And for JP Morgan,

1027
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:14,770
it things a lot better of JP Morgan,

1028
01:06:14,771 --> 01:06:17,620
but surprisingly not as much
better as you would've expected.

1029
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:21,370
They could go out of business
with 10% probability.

1030
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:24,340
There's very little chance they're going
to go out of business in the next year

1031
01:06:24,341 --> 01:06:28,370
or two. Mainly because the government is,
they're protecting them all. Okay. But in,

1032
01:06:28,371 --> 01:06:32,650
in 10 years, you know, it, it
could be very different. All right?

1033
01:06:32,651 --> 01:06:34,990
And so that's a shocking to most people.

1034
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,960
I think shockingly high probability
to those things going out of business.

1035
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:40,810
You wouldn't know yourself
what those things were,

1036
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:43,810
except if you looked at the market.
Now,

1037
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:48,010
I actually could have
computed the prices this way,

1038
01:06:48,490 --> 01:06:51,010
which is way the way we used
to compute them at Ellington.

1039
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:55,120
But there's a more direct
way of computing them.

1040
01:06:56,350 --> 01:07:01,350
There's a something called a credit
default swap credit default swap.

1041
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:07,693
Okay.

1042
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,420
Okay.
And I credit default slopped swap pays

1043
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:18,420
$1 in case a bond defaults on defaults

1044
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:23,230
within some time period.

1045
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:29,863
Okay.

1046
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:34,930
Okay. It actually pays $1 for
every dollar of principle.

1047
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:36,883
MMM.

1048
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:42,440
$1 in case a bond defaults
within some time period.

1049
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:46,490
More Pr. So I assume here that
when you default you get zero.

1050
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:47,870
So you don't always get zero.

1051
01:07:47,871 --> 01:07:51,680
Sometimes the guy is willing to work out
something and pay you part of what he

1052
01:07:51,681 --> 01:07:55,760
owed you. Okay. Because after all,
Argentine, if they default, you know,

1053
01:07:55,761 --> 01:07:58,950
and the u s is angry about it can put
a lot of pressure on Argentina and

1054
01:07:58,951 --> 01:08:01,310
refusing to trade with it,
doing all sorts of other things.

1055
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:05,360
Not that much pressure, but some
pressure and, and so maybe Argentina,

1056
01:08:05,361 --> 01:08:08,150
if it can't pay,
it will agreed to pay less and say,

1057
01:08:08,151 --> 01:08:10,730
let's forget about the whole thing.
You understand why we can't pay,

1058
01:08:10,731 --> 01:08:14,150
we're just bad things happen. It
wasn't our fault. It was unlucky.

1059
01:08:14,330 --> 01:08:18,170
So don't hold to it. Take a little bit
less and let us get on with our lives.

1060
01:08:18,171 --> 01:08:20,420
Okay.
So instead of putting Zeros down here,

1061
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:23,750
maybe you would put a recovery down there.
So we'll have to come back to that.

1062
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:25,670
So in case if there's a recovery,

1063
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:30,940
the credit default swap pays only the
gap between what it was promised and what

1064
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:34,220
it actually pay.
So it pays a $1,

1065
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:36,040
okay.

1066
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:40,570
Pays, you know, 100% of the loss.
Okay? Uh, for any bond that the faults,

1067
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:43,000
so pays a hundred percent

1068
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:46,010
of loss

1069
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:52,340
in case a bond defaults
within some time period, okay?

1070
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:54,950
Now that's,
if you buy one credit default swap,

1071
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:58,760
you could buy 50 credit
default swaps on the same bond.

1072
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:03,230
So then you'd get 50 times the loss.
So we're going to come back.

1073
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:06,350
This is going to be one of the causes
of the crisis that these credit default

1074
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:08,630
swaps got written that were so big.

1075
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:13,160
So you wouldn't have to actually do
the computation I just showed you.

1076
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:16,100
You could just look at what the
price of the credit default swap is.

1077
01:09:16,101 --> 01:09:17,390
Cause here if the payoff is zero,

1078
01:09:17,391 --> 01:09:20,930
that means the credit default swaps
going to pay the whole hundred so it's

1079
01:09:20,931 --> 01:09:24,750
priced at 16 that's telling you that
everybody thinks it wouldn't be six.

1080
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:28,100
So what would the price of the credit
default swap be over here by the way,

1081
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:30,680
wouldn't be 16 as I just
said that was wrong.

1082
01:09:30,681 --> 01:09:33,350
What would the credit default
swap price be over here?

1083
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:36,523
16

1084
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:37,480
right.

1085
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:42,480
So the credit default swap over here
would have a price equal to point of 16

1086
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:49,060
right? At 16 at 16 the
default rate is, is 0.16.

1087
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:52,400
Okay, so it's going to pay a hundred
here. That's how much it default advice.

1088
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:57,401
So it's going to be 6.16 times
a hundred that's what it pays.

1089
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:03,190
Um, so pays a hundred with probability
0.16, but then it's discounted.

1090
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,790
So it's times 95 over a hundred.

1091
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:07,200
Okay.

1092
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,360
That's what the price of
the credit default swap is.

1093
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:10,820
So if you knew what the value,

1094
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:12,930
what if you knew the price
of the credit default swap,

1095
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:17,580
you could equally get the default.
This is d over here is just a dean.

1096
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,820
So knowing d of course that tells
you the credit default swap.

1097
01:10:20,821 --> 01:10:22,440
Knowing the price of
the credit default swap,

1098
01:10:22,441 --> 01:10:26,190
you could get d so you could
deduce d in two different ways,

1099
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:28,080
either from the uh,

1100
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:33,150
American bond price or from
the a credit default swap.

1101
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,980
In either case you have to know the
American bond price in order to figure out

1102
01:10:37,981 --> 01:10:41,730
what the discount rate is. So the
credit default swap is sort of overkill.

1103
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:43,230
It's another way,
you know,

1104
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:47,910
uses all the information plus more to
get the same answer more quickly. Okay.

1105
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:51,660
Now what would the credit default swap
be worth over here? A little subtler.

1106
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:54,030
What's the credit default swap worth here?

1107
01:10:55,980 --> 01:11:00,980
So credit default swap fault
swap on Argentine two year bond

1108
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:09,190
equals what?
What would it be worth?

1109
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:22,280
How much would you pay for the
credit default swap in this case?

1110
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:31,503
Well,

1111
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:35,610
Eh,
to your bond over two year horizon.

1112
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:42,000
Okay. So it's only a tiny bit slept
with them before, you know, the,

1113
01:11:42,001 --> 01:11:45,670
the two year bond could default
in any one of two cases. Okay.

1114
01:11:45,671 --> 01:11:50,410
So it could default here
or it could default here.

1115
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:54,730
So you're going to get,
um, the American 0.9,

1116
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:57,850
right? That's the discount. I don't
know if you can see it over there.

1117
01:11:57,851 --> 01:11:59,350
So let's write it over here.

1118
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:04,960
You could get the American
over here. What's the, what's,

1119
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:10,060
what's the value of going down
here? It's one minus t one. Okay.

1120
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:14,710
Discounted by 0.9 times a hundred

1121
01:12:17,290 --> 01:12:22,110
times one. I guess the payoff is one
here in this case. Times one. Okay.

1122
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:26,830
Or You could get,
you could get paid over here.

1123
01:12:26,831 --> 01:12:29,890
So either the, when the one year
defaults, the two years defaulting to,

1124
01:12:29,891 --> 01:12:34,570
so you can get your paid here or you could
wait and get paid over here. So plus,

1125
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:39,740
um, here it's, no,

1126
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:43,840
this was wrong. It's 0.9
Times d one times one. Right?

1127
01:12:43,841 --> 01:12:45,030
Because they get paid over here,

1128
01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:48,010
you have to default or you
can get paid over here,

1129
01:12:48,011 --> 01:12:50,320
which means that you didn't
default the first period,

1130
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:54,190
but then you did the fault the
second period you get paid one.

1131
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,020
But we've got to discount that.

1132
01:12:57,010 --> 01:13:00,610
How much do we have to discount that by
what we have to do the payments coming

1133
01:13:00,611 --> 01:13:01,570
in the second period,

1134
01:13:01,571 --> 01:13:06,571
which in America is discounted at the
rate and 0.72 so that some is going to

1135
01:13:07,151 --> 01:13:09,840
give you the value of
the credit default swaps.

1136
01:13:09,841 --> 01:13:14,841
So d one we know is 0.4 and this is 0.6
so it's going to be 0.36 plus 0.438 so

1137
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:24,360
it's equal to 0.36 plus point fourth uh,

1138
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:27,730
three two

1139
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:35,620
oh 0.432 times d two
which is 50% so 0.216.

1140
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:43,380
Okay,
so that equals 0.576.

1141
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:44,071
Okay.

1142
01:13:44,071 --> 01:13:48,060
So that's how much you would pay for
the credit default swap over a two year

1143
01:13:48,061 --> 01:13:51,000
horizon on a two year Argentine
bond you've paid today.

1144
01:13:51,001 --> 01:13:55,980
Point five seven six I think I
managed to compute that correctly.

1145
01:13:56,730 --> 01:13:59,730
Um,
all right,

1146
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:02,970
so I want to end this discussion
of the fault with one,

1147
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,840
one observation,
one forum,

1148
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:09,660
which is that you can get all
these numbers incredibly fast.

1149
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:14,970
How can you get these numbers
incredibly fast? What's a trick? Okay.

1150
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:17,800
If recovery is zero, so I'm only
going to talk two more minutes here.

1151
01:14:17,801 --> 01:14:21,130
I realize I've come to the end of time.
If recovery is zero,

1152
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:24,763
okay.

1153
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:29,500
If recovery is zero, the chance of
deaf and, and the default, you know,

1154
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:32,110
if you default the first period,
you default on all the bonds.

1155
01:14:32,111 --> 01:14:34,690
If you default the second period,
you default on all the bonds.

1156
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,120
Then the trick that she, the, the,

1157
01:14:37,121 --> 01:14:42,121
that young lady who asked the first
question pointed out right away is that,

1158
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:46,540
I don't know where I wrote it, is
that the chance of default, okay.

1159
01:14:46,541 --> 01:14:51,130
From the very first equation is going
to be very simple to compute because

1160
01:14:51,131 --> 01:14:55,760
you've got the, the uh, oh,

1161
01:14:55,820 --> 01:15:00,740
I don't lost your equation anyhow.
Um, but okay. Because from the first,

1162
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:05,120
from the first equation where we
had the chance of default here,

1163
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:09,590
we just got one minus D is this 80?

1164
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:11,713
MMM.

1165
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:16,340
Okay.
How did we get this?

1166
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:21,110
We had the price of the Argentine
bond is 80 compared to the, okay,

1167
01:15:21,111 --> 01:15:21,531
so,

1168
01:15:21,531 --> 01:15:26,531
and the American bond prices 95 so we
just took 80 over 95 that ratio was the

1169
01:15:27,411 --> 01:15:30,980
chance of not defaulting
and the first year, okay,

1170
01:15:30,981 --> 01:15:35,570
so she did this incredibly quickly. This
was a faster way of doing it. The, the,

1171
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:39,170
the Argentine bond is worth
80 95th so the American bond,

1172
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,090
they're only paying in one state.

1173
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:45,440
That means the chance of Argentina Pang
divided by the chance of America paying.

1174
01:15:45,441 --> 01:15:49,310
That's the only state where you're getting
me money must be 80 over 95 so that's

1175
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:51,980
a very fast way of figuring
out what one minus D is.

1176
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:55,520
And for the two period thing,
it's equally fast. Okay,

1177
01:15:55,521 --> 01:15:57,770
so you just do one minus d two

1178
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:02,870
all right, well, I'm going
to have to start with this
next, next time. But anyway,

1179
01:16:02,871 --> 01:16:05,780
one minus t two is equally fast.
So if you look at it the right way,

1180
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,390
you can compute all these
defaults extremely quickly.
