1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,450
Okay. What I'm planning to do today
is to spend half an hour or less,

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,700
I'm just telling you, but little bit
about what a new theory might be,

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,620
a what I call the leverage cycle.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,460
And then to spend the rest of the time
maybe answering questions about the

5
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:19,080
course that you might have.

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,770
I could if he wanted to devote the
whole time to what the new theory is.

7
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:26,910
But why don't I at least pause after half
an hour and see if you have questions.

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,070
So,
um,

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,130
what is the saying that's been missing
from the entire course and has been

10
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:37,290
missing from economic theory,

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,210
I think almost entirely
for all these years. Uh,

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,470
and certainly missing from all the
textbooks that you might have looked at

13
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:47,700
during the course of the semester.

14
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:50,880
And you remember there were list of 20
bucks or something you could have read.

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,580
And that's the idea of collateral.

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,420
And it's the idea that in order to
guarantee that you're going to keep your

17
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:00,241
promise,

18
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:04,710
you have to put up collateral and
people just don't trust in everyone else

19
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:09,570
keeping their promise. They
want collateral. So if you
put that into the model, uh,

20
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:12,090
what sorts of things might be different?

21
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,950
So I want to just work out an example
so you can see how they might change.

22
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,320
I want to talk about an example that's
going to illustrate how you might,

23
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,690
what happened in our crisis.

24
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,110
And I guess it's a little
interesting that I wrote this in.

25
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:30,410
I presented this in 2000 at a world
congress and it finally got published in

26
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:35,070
2003 so this was long
before the crisis. Um, uh,

27
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,090
now as I said, there'd been other
smaller crises before in 1998,

28
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,330
maybe [inaudible] 94,
maybe 87, certainly 98.

29
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,260
And of course I was thinking about these
previous crises when I built this model,

30
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,630
but not many other people thought much
of those other crises. And as it happens,

31
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:55,680
this last one that we're still at the
bottom of are a little past the bottom of,

32
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,270
I think it's very similar to the ones
we had before. Um, but just much bigger.

33
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,870
So here's my simple version of it.
I'm going to give two models,

34
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:05,820
a very simple one with two periods.

35
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:08,520
And a slightly more complicated
one with three periods.

36
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:11,640
And of course all the interesting
things happen in a three period case.

37
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:15,180
But just to make it simple to understand,
I'm starting with the simpler ones.

38
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:18,420
So suppose that there's a security,
which I'm going to call,

39
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:21,990
why that everybody holds.

40
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,640
Why is there no shark?
Gosh,

41
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:31,290
I taught the class in here.
I just finished lecturing
in here with a whole bock.

42
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,990
Oh, here, this whole box of jock. Okay.

43
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,020
So suppose that there's a security why
that I'm going to think of as a mortgage

44
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:46,200
security or you could think of it as
a house or you could think of it as a,

45
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:49,710
an oil well that has uncertain
output and the next period,

46
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,160
and then there's going to be
something like gold that I'll call x.

47
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,960
So this might be like gold and this
might be like a mortgage security

48
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,650
or like an oil. Well, uh, where are,
you might think of it as a house,

49
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:07,870
but I'll think of a mortgage security,
an oil well,

50
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:11,320
it's something that pays an
uncertain outcome in the future.

51
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,190
And this is something that's very
stable. And you know, exactly,

52
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:17,050
you've got gold this period.
If you just save it,

53
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:18,880
you'll have the same gold next period.

54
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,290
So now people are going to differ
according to how optimistic or pessimistic

55
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,440
they are. That's my idea of
not everybody's the same.

56
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,030
So I imagine that there are
two possibilities next period.

57
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,330
Either the why the oil well produce.

58
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,580
It's a Goldwell really.

59
00:03:37,581 --> 00:03:40,820
It could produce two pieces of
gold or it could produce point,

60
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,880
I mean one piece of gold or it could
produce 0.2 20% of a piece of gold.

61
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,090
So everybody begins with one oil,
well,

62
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,090
one Morgan security and one piece of gold.
So they can,

63
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,940
they can consume the gold or they can,
you know,

64
00:03:55,941 --> 00:03:57,170
make it a filling for their teeth.

65
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:59,590
Or they could wait next period
and then they'd have it, uh,

66
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,250
in either state next period because it's
perfectly durable. Or they could, uh,

67
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,370
use the gold to buy more oil wells,

68
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,680
each of which might pay off one or 0.2.

69
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,660
So that's it. Now people care
about the consumption of gold.

70
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:15,890
The only reason they get the oil,

71
00:04:15,891 --> 00:04:18,950
well as Fisher as we've
assumed all through the class,

72
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:22,190
the only reason to get the oil well is
that it might produce gold for your next

73
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:26,120
period. Gushing oil, money, gold.

74
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:30,830
It might gush some gold for you next
period. So people care about consumption,

75
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,820
how much gold they eat here times the
probability that they're going to be up

76
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:35,481
here at times,

77
00:04:35,481 --> 00:04:39,050
how much they here plus the probability
that they're going to come down here at

78
00:04:39,051 --> 00:04:40,340
times, how much they'd
hear, in other words,

79
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:45,341
their risk neutral with no discounting
and they just multiply consumption here

80
00:04:45,591 --> 00:04:49,970
and here by the probabilities and add
the consumptions and then added to the

81
00:04:49,971 --> 00:04:50,690
consumption here.

82
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,780
That's what everybody's got the same
utility but with one difference.

83
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:59,690
H is the probability agent
h attaches to going up.

84
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,720
So I think of these people
as a continuum of buyers.

85
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:04,730
Now instead of two buyers
like we've always, yeah,

86
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,380
sad or three buyers or even one buyer.

87
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,510
I've got a continuum and they are
different because some are more optimistic

88
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:13,110
than others.

89
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,140
Now this is stuff that we haven't
really paid much attention to before.

90
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,340
So these optimists are the people who
have h very close to one and you know,

91
00:05:20,341 --> 00:05:23,680
lots of other people have ages in the
middle and there's some people who think h

92
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,920
zero that's the way they differ.

93
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,120
So of course the very most optimistic
person thinks the oil well is worth one

94
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:34,020
piece of gold. He doesn't discount and
he thinks he's going to get one for sure.

95
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:36,180
So He'd be paid willing to pay one for it.

96
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:41,181
Here the most pessimistic person thinks
the oil well is only worth 0.2 and let's

97
00:05:41,281 --> 00:05:43,860
say she'd only be willing
to pay 0.2 for it here.

98
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:45,700
Okay,

99
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,470
so what's the price of oil
wells going to be? Well,

100
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,100
if we just had our, yeah, [inaudible]
old model or one period model,

101
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:01,340
we would see the people with the high
age would sell their gold to buy more oil

102
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:04,940
wells because they thought
it would be valuable.

103
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:08,750
And the people with the low H's thinking
the oil wells weren't worth much,

104
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:13,520
would sell them to the high h people
to get more gold in the present.

105
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,460
That's basically what would happen.
Okay.

106
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:21,461
And you'd get some dividing line or
the people above a would be buying oil

107
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:22,821
wells,

108
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:27,680
spending all their money and the people
below a would be selling oil wells and

109
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:29,900
getting more money.
So for example,

110
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:34,520
if a was 0.69 which is what it's
going to turn out to be, uh,

111
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,670
Mister Aa. How, what does he
think the value of an oil well is?

112
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:42,671
He thinks it's 0.69 times one plus 0.31
times 0.2 which is 0.06 so 0.69 plus 0.0

113
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:52,640
6.75 okay,
so mister 69 things,

114
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:57,641
the oil wells worth about 75 and so if
the price everyone above him and thinks

115
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:02,990
it's worth more than 75 so if the price
were worth 75 everyone above would want

116
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:05,030
to buy and everyone below would say,

117
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:08,450
well it's not worth 0.75 so I'll sell it.

118
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,630
And since the risk neutral, you
know, they don't have their,

119
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,210
their valuation is independent
of how much of it they have.

120
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:17,870
So these people below would want to sell
everything and these people above would

121
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:18,800
want to buy everything.

122
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,730
So that's nothing different from what
we've done from the very beginning except

123
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:27,080
that maybe the one differences,
people would go to the
extreme, they would end up,

124
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,650
these guys would spend all their money
buying oil wells because every time they

125
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:34,730
bought an oil well at a price of 0.75
this guy for example is sure it's worth

126
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:36,980
one. The more he buys, the better he is.

127
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:41,030
So he spent all his money in oil wells
and these guys would sell all their oil

128
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:43,610
wells. But other than that it's
very similar to what we've done.

129
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:46,010
So what's the difference going to be?

130
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,850
The difference is just one thing.

131
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,650
Where do I divide this dividing
line? Ay well it, you know,

132
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:58,370
can these guys up here afford
to buy all these oil wells?

133
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,690
Well the answer is so far it doesn't
look like that's possible because if the

134
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,120
dividing line is,
is way up here,

135
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:09,110
these guys appear don't have enough
money to buy all the oil wells down here.

136
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:11,600
After all,
they only have one piece of gold a piece.

137
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,500
And if the oil costs 75 they
can each by one and the third.

138
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,020
If you multiply that by one and a third,

139
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,260
you're never going to buy all
these oil wells down here.

140
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,250
So this seems like it's
too high for a to B.

141
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,410
So the new twist is

142
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,880
maybe the guys up here
who want the oil wells,

143
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:33,680
who are so sure they're going to do well,

144
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,790
maybe they can borrow money
to buy the oil wells. Okay.

145
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,700
So they can make a promise
to pay money in the future,

146
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,150
maybe 0.5 and 0.5 in the future,

147
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:49,070
say and then sell those promises
and uh, you know, borrow money,

148
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:49,491
in other words,

149
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:53,390
promising in the future and then use
that money to buy more oil wells.

150
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,780
So that's what people do in the market.
Any hedge fund,

151
00:08:57,781 --> 00:08:59,790
the three definitions of a hedge fund,

152
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,010
the three defining
characteristics of a hedge fund,

153
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:06,640
I think I might've said ones are a,
that they hedge.

154
00:09:06,641 --> 00:09:09,750
So unlike other money managers,
they're always trying to hedge.

155
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:11,820
And we talked about what
hedging is and many,

156
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:15,030
many more managers are doing that
than ever before. So that's not,

157
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,270
so it's different from 50% of the people,

158
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:21,480
but not from the hedge funds or 5%.

159
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:25,350
And the other 45% are also hedgings.
That's not so different.

160
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,700
The second thing they do is they
borrow money to make their investments.

161
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,310
A lot of these other managers
aren't allowed to borrow. They just,

162
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,260
they may not be allowed to hedge either.
Those are called long only managers.

163
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:41,940
They can't hedge. Some of them
can't borrow hedge funds. Borough,

164
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,810
I mean hedge and borrow. And then hedge
funds charge high fees. That's the third,

165
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,830
uh, defining characteristic.
But anyway, so they borrowed.

166
00:09:48,831 --> 00:09:50,850
So a lot of these p and in the economy,

167
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:55,560
I told you last time a huge number of
people borrowed a huge amount of money.

168
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,420
So borrowing is obviously very important.

169
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,410
So how much are they going to be able
to borrow? I mean, this guy, number one,

170
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,250
he'd like to borrow as much as he could.
Every time he borrows money,

171
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,360
he's sure that he's going to be up here.
So every time he borrows a dollar,

172
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,110
he gets to make an investment that he
sure is going to be a great investment and

173
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:16,770
he's planning on paying everything back
because you know he sure he's going to

174
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:19,620
go up here. So He's going to
be incredibly rich. So He's,

175
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:21,120
he's going to pay back what he borrows,

176
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,790
but he's going to get my at such a profit.
He's going to make a fortune.

177
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,980
So if people could borrow however much
they wanted to and promise to pay back,

178
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:31,550
this guy would borrow
everything, Mr One. I mean,

179
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,190
we'd borrow everything and imagine
he was going to get up here for sure.

180
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,490
And I imagine he was going to keep his
promise for sure and he'd bid the price

181
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:43,050
up almost to one.
Okay,

182
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:47,400
but now who's going to lend to them and
how much will they actually lend to them?

183
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,380
Well, in our old world, we didn't
worry about who was gonna land.

184
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:55,410
Everybody assumed they're going
to get paid back. But in reality,

185
00:10:55,411 --> 00:10:58,140
people don't assume they're
going to get paid back.

186
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:00,270
The lenders are going to say
to themselves, wait a minute,

187
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,920
if this guy promises us
to pay us a 0.5 and 0.5,

188
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,240
um, maybe he'll be very rich over
here and we'll be able to pay us back.

189
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,240
But you know, I'm not sure he's
going to be so rich here. I mean,

190
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:14,280
what is it that he had?
I don't even know what he has.

191
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:18,000
How do I know what the borrower is
going to actually have in the states?

192
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:22,170
I don't want to look into his personal
bank account and find out everything

193
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:23,370
about him.
And you know,

194
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:27,570
that's the way banks who lend sometimes
do that and they go to a lot of effort

195
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:30,270
to check. You know, how
reliable a borrower you are,

196
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,280
but people in general, but most
of the lenders don't, you know,

197
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:37,830
you don't want to do that.
That was the idea of securitization.

198
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:42,831
We don't have to have so much careful
looking into the personal finances.

199
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:47,490
So everybody much simpler
is to use the asset.

200
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:51,840
Why is collateral? So if, why is
collateral? What does that mean?

201
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:55,390
When you lend a dollar to a borrower,

202
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,000
the borrower just doesn't borrow the book.

203
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,690
The dollar promising to pave something
back in the future. The borrower says,

204
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,270
if I don't pay you back,
you can take the asset.

205
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,350
So the question is for each
unit of the asset, why?

206
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,210
How much can you borrow when you
have the asset as collateral?

207
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,740
That's the question of leverage.
So if you take the value of y

208
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,050
divided by the, uh, the,

209
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,690
the cash down, okay, so the,
so let's do two numbers.

210
00:12:30,691 --> 00:12:32,250
So the borrowed

211
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,240
all is burrowed using Y as collateral
that divided by the value of y.

212
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,700
That's what we call the loan to value

213
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,310
LTV, loan to value, okay?

214
00:12:53,311 --> 00:12:55,710
Another way of saying
that is the borrowed.

215
00:12:55,711 --> 00:13:00,711
If you take why dollar y
minus dollars borrowed,

216
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,210
okay? That all right, well, Trey,

217
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,130
the denominator dollars bar,
dollar y minus dollars borrowed,

218
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,670
okay?

219
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,620
And here you put value of y.

220
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,830
So just dollar Y my boards.

221
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,630
Okay,
the dollar of y minus the dollar borrower,

222
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,700
that's the cash you had to put down.

223
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,970
So that's the dollar of y
divided by the cash down.

224
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,400
They,
that's what's called leverage.

225
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,173
Okay.

226
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:50,130
So, and it's obviously the same thing as
loan to value because you just sort of

227
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,950
invert the number and do a subtraction.
You get leverage.

228
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:56,340
So if you knew the loan devalue
nor the leverage and vice versa,

229
00:13:56,341 --> 00:13:59,940
they're the same thing.
So what should the loan devalue be?

230
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:02,370
And so as I said in the,
uh,

231
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:06,810
in historically what's happened over the
last 10 years for housing is you had to

232
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:11,520
put 14% down.
The leverage was seven for buying houses,

233
00:14:11,521 --> 00:14:14,130
non non, uh, agency houses,

234
00:14:14,131 --> 00:14:16,980
non-prime houses starting in 2000.

235
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:22,190
And then it went to 33 or 35 to one
because you put down less than 3% the in a

236
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:28,060
2006. So this leverage shot up
and then it suddenly collapsed,

237
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:31,470
you had to put 25% down. Okay,
so leverage fell to four.

238
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,740
So that I'm going to explain has a big
effect on what the House on the price of

239
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:40,320
housing and the price of mortgage
securities. So what should leverage me?

240
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:42,930
How can supply and demand
determine what leverage is?

241
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,990
So it seems like you've got
to clear all these markets.

242
00:14:45,991 --> 00:14:49,620
You've got to figure out how does the Y,
sorry, how does the, why market clear?

243
00:14:49,621 --> 00:14:52,220
How does the gold market clear?
Um,

244
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,290
and then on top of that you
have to figure out leverage.

245
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,960
It seems like it's a lot of
complicated things to figure out.

246
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,440
And I think economist just thought,
wow, there's so much going on, you know,

247
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,041
we might as well,

248
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,800
and people really Gilani generally
keeping their promises anyway.

249
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:07,370
Let's ignore the fact that you have
to have all this collateral. Well,

250
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:10,190
I think the collateral is the
heart of the problem in finance.

251
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,440
So how would it work in this
uh, model? So are you with me?

252
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:19,010
But what the where, where
we're going? Okay. So

253
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:24,710
you have to conceptually figure
out how to think about the problem.

254
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,410
So that was a, so how, in other words,

255
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:31,880
conceptually the question is
how can supply equals demand,

256
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,890
which sounds like one equation.

257
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,320
How can that determine leverage?

258
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,140
Yeah.

259
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,530
Well, the interest rate supply
equals demand for loans.

260
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:46,730
Okay.

261
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,680
How can that determine the interest rate?

262
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,663
Okay.

263
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,550
And the leverage.

264
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,753
Okay.

265
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,330
It seems like you have one equation and
how can you determine two things with

266
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:07,680
one equation? Well, the
answer is that you can do it.

267
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,960
Okay.
And so we just soaked.

268
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,690
But first we need a conceptual
framework to think about it.

269
00:16:12,691 --> 00:16:16,890
So it seems like a contradiction,
almost a mathematical contradiction.

270
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,880
So it must be that the problem is
ill posed and so I claim it is.

271
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,120
So what you really should be thinking is
that there's not just one interest rate

272
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,080
and one leverage.

273
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:32,850
You should be thinking that there's
the Collat, there's the promise.

274
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:35,380
Okay.

275
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:39,400
And then there's the collateral and
those things taken together. Define,

276
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,340
define the contract.

277
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:47,370
So let's say the promises point to 0.2
and the collateral is one unit of y.

278
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,240
Okay.

279
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,320
Going to have x 0.2 of x.

280
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,240
So you're promising to units of gold in
the future and you've got one unit of

281
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:02,990
why is your collateral.
So that implies a delivery

282
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,613
of

283
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:12,140
0.2 and point to why is that?
Because in the good state at the top,

284
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,150
the collateral is worth one.

285
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:18,650
So if you've made the promise and
the lender can seize your collateral,

286
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:19,490
if you don't pay,

287
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,790
you're getting either pay point to where
he's going to seize the collateral.

288
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,140
And so you're gonna pay point too.

289
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,630
Maybe you'll sell some of the
collateral to pay point too.

290
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,320
And if the promises a 0.2 down here,
the same thing,

291
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:32,960
either he's going to seize the collateral,
the lender will seize the collateral,

292
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:35,270
you'll sell it and keep your promise.
In either case,

293
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:39,620
it'll live are point to point to and
it's going to sell for some price.

294
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,320
Okay.
And the price is actually going to be one.

295
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:50,010
So the interest rate effectively zero,
why is that?

296
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,790
Well,
because at time zero over here,

297
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,490
no one discounts the future gold at the
beginning is worth exact to everybody.

298
00:17:59,491 --> 00:18:02,940
I unit of gold at the beginnings of the
same as the unit of gold at the end,

299
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,880
you know, in both states, cause everyone's
probabilities at up to one, you know,

300
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,620
age plus one minus h is one.

301
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,550
So you might as well consume at the
beginning or for sure at the end.

302
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,670
So since there's a lot of
gold sloshing around here,

303
00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:18,480
they're always lenders willing to lend
at a 0% interest and they're getting

304
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:19,710
their money back for sure.

305
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,020
So it'll turn out that the interest rate
on this kind of loan, which is riskless,

306
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,060
is going to be zero because
no one's discounting and
they're getting their money

307
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:31,260
for sure.
But what if you promise 0.3 and 0.3

308
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:33,490
yeah,

309
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,640
with one unit of y as collateral.
Hey,

310
00:18:37,641 --> 00:18:40,920
then what would the delivery
be in that case? Well,

311
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:45,570
the delivery wouldn't be 0.3 0.3 because
the only thing protecting the promise

312
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,040
is the collateral we'll delivery
would be 0.3 and point to,

313
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:51,661
right,

314
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:56,100
because in the upstate your collateral
is worth one and so you would be forced

315
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,680
to pay the 0.3 in the downstate.

316
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,770
You would do what a lot of homeowners
are doing now and say, okay,

317
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,990
I owe you so much money.
You know,

318
00:19:03,991 --> 00:19:08,640
my loan devalues 150% the value of
my house has gone down to two thirds.

319
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:12,780
The loan is 140 or 50% of the
value of my house. I mean,

320
00:19:12,781 --> 00:19:17,160
I'd be crazy to pay you 150%. Um,
you know, I don't effectively,

321
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:20,940
I don't own my house. I owe so much more
than my house than a the house is worth.

322
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,090
I can't give it to my children.
I can't do anything with the house anyway.

323
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:28,040
Why should I just pay such a
huge amount of money? You know,

324
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,370
I might as well just give up the house.

325
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:31,800
They walk away from the house
and the lender gets point too.

326
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,530
So 0.3 0.2 would be the delivery.

327
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:37,800
And of course if it was 0.4 and 0.4,

328
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,300
it would also be 0.4 and 0.2.
Okay.

329
00:19:42,301 --> 00:19:45,660
Now if you made this
promise of 0.3 and 0.3,

330
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,960
you'd be delivering something
more than 0.2 at the top.

331
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:54,870
So the price,
of course we'd be more than 0.3.

332
00:19:54,871 --> 00:19:59,871
So the price might be priced at the 0.3
promise will turn out to be something.

333
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:02,690
Okay?

334
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:07,130
Like 0.2, six one say. Okay,

335
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:12,131
it might be 0.261 let's just say 0.261.

336
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,421
Okay.

337
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:18,421
So effectively you're borrowing 0.261
you're delivering 0.3 this is the 0.3 this

338
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,281
is up here.

339
00:20:21,281 --> 00:20:26,281
Pie Point three 0.261 sub 0.3 okay?

340
00:20:28,391 --> 00:20:30,970
So effectively what your
interest rate is in the state,

341
00:20:30,971 --> 00:20:32,590
when you can pay back at the top,

342
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,890
your interest rate is like
is a 0.39 over 0.261 it's uh,

343
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:43,260
like 14% or 15% actually it's a 15% okay,

344
00:20:44,921 --> 00:20:49,921
so 0.3 of or 0.61261 is a
so 0.3 over 0.261 is 1.15.

345
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:58,540
So this over here means 15% interest.
Okay?

346
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,530
So you've effectively,

347
00:20:59,531 --> 00:21:02,050
because they know you're going
to default and one of the states,

348
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:04,960
you have to pay much more than
you borrowed in the good state.

349
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:07,780
So effectively you're
promising a 15% interest.

350
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:11,010
You're promising it and all the
states you're only delivering, you're,

351
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,960
you're not only delivering a portion
of what you promise in the bad state.

352
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,670
All right. So what's my
point? My point is that the,

353
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,300
the apparent contradiction supply
equals demand. Determining one.

354
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:27,190
Both interest in leverage
is no contradiction at all
because actually we've got

355
00:21:27,191 --> 00:21:29,530
many supply equals demand equations.

356
00:21:29,531 --> 00:21:33,010
There are many different loans
depending on what the collateral,

357
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:36,070
the ratio of the collateral
to the promise. Okay.

358
00:21:36,071 --> 00:21:39,460
There are many different loans in each
of themselves for a different price.

359
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,710
So we've got many different things.

360
00:21:41,711 --> 00:21:44,830
We're determining many
interest rates determined by,

361
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,500
but one supply equals demand
equation for each one.

362
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:50,620
So every supply equals demand
equation produces one price.

363
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:53,560
There's no contradiction.
However,

364
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,080
that's still raised leaves
us with the question,

365
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,530
which of these many contracts
are going to be traded?

366
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,880
Can we say that the economy as a whole
has a single rate of a single leverage

367
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:09,100
and they're, the surprise is, and this is
the end of the first part of the model,

368
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,320
the surprise is yes,

369
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,430
we can only this one
is going to get traded.

370
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,653
Hmm.

371
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,140
So everybody in the economy,

372
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,350
no matter how optimistic you
are or how pessimistic you are,

373
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,060
even though you have the available chance
to make a bigger promise, of course,

374
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:40,030
having to promise a bigger
interest rate, even though, sorry,

375
00:22:40,031 --> 00:22:42,880
there's the interest rate. Even though
everyone has available that opportunity,

376
00:22:42,881 --> 00:22:46,780
they won't avail themselves of that.
Everybody will trade on this promise.

377
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,760
So how could that be? And by the
way, before we answer that question,

378
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:56,830
let's just see that if everyone used
this promise that in fact the price we

379
00:22:56,831 --> 00:22:59,740
talked about before would,
would prevail. Okay?

380
00:22:59,741 --> 00:23:03,580
So why is this 0.69 that a
should be a little lower?

381
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:06,490
It doesn't look like 0.69 looks
a little too high. But anyway,

382
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:11,500
it's supposed to be 69% of the way up. Why
is that the right price? Well, how much,

383
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,560
how much could these guys buy?
Well,

384
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:18,730
the top 31% okay there.

385
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:22,330
What can they do?
They've got 0.31 cigarettes,

386
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,790
okay, so I'll write it over here. They've
got 0.31 cigarette's between them,

387
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,550
the top 31% of the buyers,
right?

388
00:23:33,551 --> 00:23:38,500
So we've got 31% here and
69% of the people down here,

389
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:41,631
okay?

390
00:23:41,631 --> 00:23:46,631
And here's a equals 0.69 so these guys
have three one cigarette's between them.

391
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,480
Now if they promise every
time they buy an oil,

392
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:54,630
well they promised 0.2 units.
Okay, there's a container.

393
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:58,460
Every one of them, they're going to buy
all the oil wells and the whole economy.

394
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,290
So however many people there are here,
let's call it massive one,

395
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:07,100
maybe it's a million people,
massive one, they're going to buy,

396
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:11,150
they're going to borrow 0.2.
Okay?

397
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:14,240
So this is their own gold.

398
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,640
And this is borrowed goal.

399
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:26,660
Did I say cigarettes? Yes, I
met. Yeah. It's another example
of a gold, I meant gold.

400
00:24:26,661 --> 00:24:30,530
So you can think of gold,
consume it now or consume it later.

401
00:24:30,531 --> 00:24:32,750
Cigarettes you can consume
now or consume later.

402
00:24:32,751 --> 00:24:36,020
You have all these identity things in
my head of what I could have interpreted

403
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:38,600
it. So yeah, I mean gold. So you
can consume the goal. Thank you.

404
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,750
The gold now or the gold
later. Okay, so you've owned,

405
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,150
each of these guys owns a unit of gold.

406
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:47,780
So 31% of the population has a
unit of gold. So you've got 0.3,

407
00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:51,920
one total units of gold.
They end up buying all the oil wells.

408
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,040
And so that's uh,
uh,

409
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,010
how much can they borrow on all
the oil wells using as collateral?

410
00:24:58,011 --> 00:24:58,701
So the oil wells,

411
00:24:58,701 --> 00:25:03,020
they started with they burrow using those
as collateral and the oil wells that

412
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:06,290
they buy, they also use as collateral.
So they've got all the oil wells,

413
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:11,210
they're making the point to point to
promise. Okay. But it has a price of one,

414
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:13,310
there's no interest,
it's interest rate is zero.

415
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:17,390
So they're borrowing 0.2 so the total
amount of gold that they have at their

416
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:22,391
disposal is 0.31 plus point to and how
many oil wells do they have to buy?

417
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:28,300
Point six 69% of the oils 0.69 and if you
take 31 and 20 that's 51 over 69 which

418
00:25:32,121 --> 00:25:34,880
is about 0.75 which is
exactly what I said,

419
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:39,881
the prices that's going to make this guy
Mr 69 exactly in different to buying or

420
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:40,881
selling.

421
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:45,680
So all the people up here are going to
say at the price of 0.75 it really is a

422
00:25:45,681 --> 00:25:48,770
good deal.
I want to buy and borrow as much as I can.

423
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,420
People down here are all going to want
to sell the people up here with the money

424
00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:57,800
they started with plus what they can
borrow are going to be able to indeed by

425
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,940
all these oil wells at a price of
0.75 that's what we just found.

426
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:06,200
And that's why that's the equilibrium.
Did that go too fast or

427
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:07,960
okay?

428
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,790
Almost too fast? Yeah. Question.

429
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:15,280
I was just wondering
why is that?

430
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:20,010
Oh okay. Because you're going
to get the money for sure.

431
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:25,200
So how much money is being
lent basically point to,

432
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,930
so there's a huge number
of guys down here.

433
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,320
They're total amount
of gold is 0.69 right?

434
00:26:31,321 --> 00:26:35,370
They've got 69 there's one giant because
of one unit of gold and the whole

435
00:26:35,371 --> 00:26:36,204
economy,

436
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,470
they own 69% of the gold and they're
only lending in total point too.

437
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,860
So there's lots of extra goal that
they have that they're lending.

438
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,900
So in the interest,
you know,

439
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:49,320
they don't care whether they get gold
now or gold later cause there's no

440
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:52,020
discounting and they're getting
the money back for sure.

441
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:55,620
So competition between these lenders is
going to drive the interest rate all the

442
00:26:55,621 --> 00:26:58,410
way to zero.
If the interest rate were positive,

443
00:26:58,411 --> 00:27:01,710
they'd all want to rush in
and lend because then they're
going to get more gold

444
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:03,990
out at the end than they had at
the beginning and there and there.

445
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:06,270
There's not discounting.
So the,

446
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,260
the competition among lenders will
drive the interest rate down to zero and

447
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:14,040
they're guaranteed to get paid back
because the, the collaterals big enough.

448
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,593
You had a question.

449
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:31,100
Oh and I said the price is one. Yes,
the price per unit is 0.2. Yeah,

450
00:27:31,101 --> 00:27:32,450
that's horrible.
Thank you.

451
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:37,250
The prices point to exactly the price
is 0.2 for the promise of point to point

452
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,870
to it's price of one per unit promise
the prices point to exactly. Gosh,

453
00:27:41,871 --> 00:27:45,020
we're in a terrible mistake. Thank
you very much. It's point to exactly.

454
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,620
And that's why these guys,
they are able to uh,

455
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:52,850
so there the prices points.
So I just do it point to they're all,

456
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,830
they're promising 0.2 and the
price per unit promise. He,

457
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:01,220
so this price was, yeah, it's prices
point too. Okay. So there for every,

458
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,570
okay, so it per unit promised there
their prices. One in other words.

459
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:08,960
So they're promising 0.2 and
per unit promise the prices one.

460
00:28:08,961 --> 00:28:13,160
So the price of the whole promises
point to exactly. So it's just that,

461
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,870
so that was, that was, okay.

462
00:28:14,871 --> 00:28:19,730
So the price is point to the pro using
the whole of the economy's worth of oil

463
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:20,990
wells is collateral.

464
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,710
You can promise 20% of all the
gold and then you're gonna get,

465
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,500
you'll be able to borrow
doing that the same amount,

466
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:29,840
20% of all the gold because
the interest rates zero.

467
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,753
Yes.

468
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:34,451
Okay.

469
00:28:34,451 --> 00:28:39,130
So that's why this total amount of
gold that they can get their hands on.

470
00:28:39,131 --> 00:28:41,410
Some people call it liquidity,
all this stuff,

471
00:28:41,411 --> 00:28:43,060
they can get their hands on capital.

472
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,270
They take all that and they
buy all the oil wells they can.

473
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,170
This is how many are being sold and
that's therefore what the price is.

474
00:28:50,171 --> 00:28:54,880
The ratio 51 to 69 is almost exactly
0.75 so I'm rounding off a little bit.

475
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,081
Okay.

476
00:28:56,081 --> 00:29:00,970
And that's why Mr Aa of
0.69 is indifferent at this
price to buying or selling.

477
00:29:00,971 --> 00:29:02,620
The guys above him all want to buy.

478
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,070
This is how much money they can get their
hands on and therefore what they can

479
00:29:06,071 --> 00:29:09,310
spend. All these guys want to
sell. That's what they're selling.

480
00:29:09,311 --> 00:29:13,180
That's why this justifies the price and
these guys are the ones lending to these

481
00:29:13,181 --> 00:29:13,511
guys.

482
00:29:13,511 --> 00:29:16,420
The pessimists have nothing to do but
Latin because they don't want to buy the

483
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,254
acid.

484
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,310
Yeah.

485
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,570
Okay.
Does this make sense?

486
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,570
I'm just going to repeat the same thing
with a three period model where it gets

487
00:29:23,571 --> 00:29:27,560
more exciting, but the logic of this is
critical. So are is everyone with me?

488
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,570
Okay. Now there's one thing I left out in
this one period, model two period model,

489
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:37,340
which is what about the 0.3 0.3 promise?
You know the optimist?

490
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:41,860
He said, let's add h equals one
take that guy, he says himself,

491
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:45,040
I can't lose.
Why should I?

492
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,370
Why should I be satisfied?

493
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:56,750
Why should I be satisfied
with only promising 0.2 0.2
why don't I make a bigger

494
00:29:57,601 --> 00:30:02,160
promise like 0.3 0.3 okay
with my bigger promise,

495
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:03,690
I get more money today.

496
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:07,980
And with that extra money today I can

497
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,410
use it and buy an oil well and uh,
you know,

498
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:16,140
I'm going to make a profit of 33%.

499
00:30:16,141 --> 00:30:19,260
My 0.75 is going to take
turn into one for sure.

500
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,930
So why isn't that just a
brilliant thing for me to do?

501
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,400
You know? So why should I be satisfied?
The more oil wells I get my hands on,

502
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:31,570
the better I seem to do.

503
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:38,680
So why is he not making the
0.3 0.3 promise? Well, if so,

504
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:41,360
it sounds like he ought to,
but if you think about it one more minute,

505
00:30:41,361 --> 00:30:44,300
you'll realize that he shouldn't.
And why is that?

506
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:49,100
Because he could promise 0.2 0.2.
So if he makes the 0.3 0.3 promise,

507
00:30:49,101 --> 00:30:53,030
of course he has to give up the point to
point to promise because the oil, well,

508
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:56,390
he used as collateral
for the 0.3 0.3 promise.

509
00:30:56,391 --> 00:30:59,330
He no longer has available for
the point to point to promise.

510
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,010
So the question isn't, you know,
should he do a 0.3 0.3 promise?

511
00:31:04,011 --> 00:31:06,410
Well if that was the only thing he
could do, of course he wouldn't do that.

512
00:31:06,411 --> 00:31:09,860
So of course it looks profitable but he's
already got a great profit opportunity.

513
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,910
The question is, is it a better profit
opportunity? And the answer is no.

514
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,140
Why is that?

515
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:20,230
Because he's still delivering 0.2 down
here when he makes the 0.3 0.3 promise.

516
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:24,080
But when he makes the 0.3 0.3 promise,
he delivers more at the top,

517
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:28,160
namely 0.3 but that's the state
he sure he is going to happen.

518
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,830
So compared to the point
to point to promise,

519
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,970
he's giving away more money just in the
state that he thinks is going to occur.

520
00:31:34,971 --> 00:31:38,180
That's very expensive for him. That's
a horrible thing for him to have to do.

521
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:42,680
And who's lending him the money? It's
the guy down here and the guy down here,

522
00:31:42,681 --> 00:31:47,390
that's the pessimists. He's, he doesn't
think that top states going to occur.

523
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:51,470
So he's only willing to pay extra
money at the beginning. You know,

524
00:31:51,471 --> 00:31:54,440
he's not willing to pay very much extra
money at the beginning because he's

525
00:31:54,441 --> 00:31:57,980
going to get stuff in a state. He doesn't
think it's going to happen. So anyway,

526
00:31:57,981 --> 00:32:01,130
I don't have time to work it all out.
But if you think it through,

527
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:06,160
you'll realize that nobody wants to do
this trade because the guys at the top

528
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:11,720
who seem to have the greatest advantage
and doing burrowing more when they

529
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,790
borrow more in this way,
where they're defaulting,

530
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,150
they're actually paying more only in the
state that they think is going to occur.

531
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,120
And the people doing the lending or
getting money only in the state they think

532
00:32:20,121 --> 00:32:20,954
won't occur.

533
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,650
So both of them think it's a worse
arrangement than the original 0.2 0.2

534
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,180
arrangement.
And so they'll,

535
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,670
even though there's a price and
it's available to be traded,

536
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,340
nobody will want to trade it.
Okay.

537
00:32:31,341 --> 00:32:35,360
So the market does indeed
pick out a single leverage.

538
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,560
And what is the leverage?

539
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:40,850
The leverage as we calculated from
this is the price of the asset,

540
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:45,920
which is 0.75 divided by the cash down,

541
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,420
which is 0.55 because you could borrow
a point too and that's, you know,

542
00:32:50,421 --> 00:32:54,500
1.4 or something,
I don't know exactly,

543
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:57,710
but let's say 1.38 leverage

544
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,190
1.35 is the leverage. Okay. So
it's not that high. The leverage.

545
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,690
Yeah.

546
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:09,200
Okay. And the principle is that we just
discovered when you have this kind of

547
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:10,280
Heterogeneity,

548
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,580
different kinds of heterogeneity
produce different amounts of leverage,

549
00:33:13,581 --> 00:33:16,310
and I'm not going to be able to talk about
that, but with this kind of leverage,

550
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,960
the promise will always be the
maximum for which there's no default.

551
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:26,810
Hey, that's how much borrowing is going
to happen in the markets going to allow.

552
00:33:26,811 --> 00:33:30,020
So what market do we always see
that happening in the Ypo market?

553
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:32,180
It's a one day market.
Uh,

554
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:36,170
overnight you put up a
security as collateral and
you could borrow money on it

555
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:39,350
and there's almost never any
default on those markets.

556
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,060
Even in the tremendous crisis,

557
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:45,530
we just had almost zero defaults in
the repo markets. Mortgage markets,

558
00:33:45,531 --> 00:33:47,240
there were default,
but they're,

559
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,430
the heterogeneity isn't
just how optimistic you are.

560
00:33:49,431 --> 00:33:50,930
It's whether you like to
live in the house or not.

561
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:54,080
So it's a different case which I
won't have time to cover. Okay,

562
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:57,610
so this is part one. We're just going
to say the same thing in part two.

563
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,690
I'm going slower than I thought.
But anyway,

564
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,440
the last model is going to be parked too.
So any questions about that?

565
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,900
This first part?
Yeah.

566
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:10,850
I mean maybe this is sort of a silly
question, but I'm sure it's not there.

567
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,220
Are there some lenders sort of in the,
in the middle,

568
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:18,221
like more optimistic pessimists to think
the upstate it's like more likely to

569
00:34:18,981 --> 00:34:22,070
occur should be like maybe
are willing to let me.

570
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,910
Well there are people,
there are,

571
00:34:23,911 --> 00:34:26,250
there's a whole continuum of
people between zero and one.

572
00:34:26,251 --> 00:34:29,340
So the guys in the middle,
they really don't have any choice here.

573
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:32,160
You'd see in the,
in the two period and then the next model,

574
00:34:32,161 --> 00:34:33,270
there's going to be a difference.

575
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:37,080
But now you really don't have any choice
if you're really, if you're above a,

576
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,600
you should buy to the maximum
loose your bolt blow away,

577
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,120
you should sell everything and you know,
you don't,

578
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,030
you don't care if you lend or not because
you're definitely going to get paid

579
00:34:45,031 --> 00:34:47,670
back. So they're all
willing to lend. Okay.

580
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:49,620
But that's not going to be so let's now,

581
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:54,150
but so let's now go to the third,
the to the next model.

582
00:34:54,151 --> 00:34:58,800
So that was a great question. So far
we only get two categories of people,

583
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,090
buyers, borrowers, sellers,
lenders. But let's now, so,

584
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,880
so we're going to move beyond
that in the next example.

585
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,310
Any questions about this one?
Okay.

586
00:35:08,311 --> 00:35:12,240
So we get equilibrium
leverage and leverage has a
tremendous effect on the price.

587
00:35:12,241 --> 00:35:13,740
Why does it affect the price?

588
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:18,210
Because the fact that these guys were
able to borrow so much money is what made

589
00:35:18,211 --> 00:35:21,480
the price so high.
If they couldn't borrow,

590
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,990
that would wipe out this
point to the price. You know,

591
00:35:24,991 --> 00:35:27,870
I couldn't have borrowed that so they
would have only had this much to spend.

592
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,650
So the price would have had to be much
lower and of course these guys wouldn't

593
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:35,430
have been able to afford all this. So
you know, as the price gets much lower,

594
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:39,360
more people would want to buy and you'd
the marginal buyer down here and there'd

595
00:35:39,361 --> 00:35:43,170
be a much lower price. So this is
borrowing is what jacked up the price.

596
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,150
Leverage means high prices.

597
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:49,440
It seems like the most obvious thing in
the world and common sensical thing in

598
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:54,000
the world. But remember it never
got mentioned in this course,

599
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,940
right?
It never gets mentioned in any textbook.

600
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,280
The price is supposed to
be the fundamental value,

601
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:01,110
the present value of all the dividends.

602
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,950
Well present value of the expected
present value of all the dividends,

603
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:09,240
meaning nine is the covariance or
something where it was leveraged in that

604
00:36:09,241 --> 00:36:12,630
formula, it didn't happen. Okay.
Because we didn't have the idea.

605
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,630
We assume that everyone could
borrow as much as they wanted to,

606
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:19,830
but here we see that they can't
borrow as much as they want to.

607
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:22,830
They're limited in how much they can
borrow. And because they're limited,

608
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:26,160
it's going to turn out.
If you make the limit less severe,

609
00:36:26,161 --> 00:36:29,010
they're going to borrow more and the
price is going to be higher. You know,

610
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:29,441
so you,

611
00:36:29,441 --> 00:36:32,730
you ignore leverage by saying people
can always borrow whatever they want to,

612
00:36:32,731 --> 00:36:36,090
then you didn't never gets
mentioned. Uh, but okay,

613
00:36:36,091 --> 00:36:40,380
but it's the heart of the matter I
think, at least in a crisis. Okay,

614
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:42,630
so let's just do one more
version of the model.

615
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,320
Okay.

616
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,150
Which is the same thing but
now with one extra period.

617
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,630
So what's the extra period going to do?

618
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:59,550
The extra period is we've got,
instead of two periods,

619
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:03,540
we have three periods.
So what's going to happen is the collapse,

620
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:08,280
the point to only happens with
two pieces of damn bad news.

621
00:37:08,281 --> 00:37:12,870
You have to go down twice to get 0.2.
Otherwise why pays off one?

622
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:17,100
And everyone's going to begin at the
beginning there with one unit of y and one

623
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:21,060
unit of gold just as before.
And they're going to pay a,

624
00:37:21,061 --> 00:37:24,210
and they could consume in the middle
or they could consume in the end.

625
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:25,350
But they have no more endowments.

626
00:37:25,351 --> 00:37:28,770
All their endowments are
right at the beginning, one
unit of Y, one unit of gold.

627
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:32,310
There's no discounting. They just
care about the expected consumption,

628
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,840
the differences. Now it takes two
periods to see the realization.

629
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,330
So two pieces of bad news.

630
00:37:39,331 --> 00:37:43,290
Now why is that interesting
to pieces of bad news? Well,

631
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,760
when I was in the crisis,

632
00:37:44,761 --> 00:37:47,970
both in 98 when I thought about
this model created this model,

633
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:50,460
but it also recently is,
you know,

634
00:37:50,461 --> 00:37:53,010
people start to realize
things are going wrong.

635
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,680
So something goes wrong and
everyone says, well, you know,

636
00:37:55,681 --> 00:37:59,580
things are still okay now, but I
realize we're closer. You know,

637
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:03,270
it takes a lot of things to go wrong
for things to collapse, but you know,

638
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,930
each time one of them goes wrong,
you're a little closer to the collapse.

639
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:09,270
So you see what happens is that,
uh,

640
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:14,330
so I make the assumption that every agent
agents are all identical except agent

641
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:18,330
h high h means you think
you're going to get up moves.

642
00:38:18,331 --> 00:38:21,450
But there are two moves at the
beginning and also in the second period.

643
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,880
So if you're an optimist
about the first up move,

644
00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:26,220
you're also going to be an
optimist about the second up move.

645
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:31,440
Now let's suppose your h equals 0.87 say
just to pick a number which is going to

646
00:38:31,441 --> 00:38:35,920
turn out to be a pivotal guy,
Mr 87 at the beginning,

647
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:40,390
the chances of going down our 13% for him,

648
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,220
then 13% more.

649
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:46,390
So the chance of getting a
disaster he thinks is 13% squared,

650
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,720
1.69% under 2% so he thinks the value of
the asset is over 98 cause with 98 per,

651
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:58,930
you know under 2% here, the rest of
the 98 must be over there somewhere.

652
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:04,170
So it's obviously his valuation has
over 98 now once he gets down to here,

653
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,390
he realizes the chances have
gone from 1.69% to 13% okay,

654
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:14,410
so his valuation is going to be a little
bit more than 87 because it's going to

655
00:39:14,411 --> 00:39:18,970
be 87% of that and 13% of that.
So it's 87 plus a little bit.

656
00:39:18,971 --> 00:39:23,080
So he's going to go down from
98 something to 87 something.

657
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:27,670
So of course when the first downstate
happens, everybody gets more pessimistic,

658
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:31,420
including Mr 87 he now
thinks that the acid value,

659
00:39:31,421 --> 00:39:35,320
maybe one from 98 to 87
which is an 11 point drop.

660
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:40,590
Okay? And everybody's
going to have a drop. He,

661
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:45,620
he went from a 98 plus
two 87 plus a little bit.

662
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:51,940
So it was an 11 point drop is
what he thinks happened. Okay?

663
00:39:51,941 --> 00:39:54,340
So you can see this as bad news
when you, when, when they're,

664
00:39:54,341 --> 00:39:58,120
it takes two things to go wrong.
The first piece of bad news is going to,

665
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,770
you know,
people are going to take it as bad news.

666
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:04,120
But the interesting thing that happens
is that actually they get more uncertain.

667
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:07,270
So this is a very special, you know,
things go up, you get one for sure.

668
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:10,450
Now you've learned something.
There's no uncertainty here.

669
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:14,710
The move down created more uncertainty
than you had before. So if you look,

670
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:19,060
and not only that more disagreement,
I mean Mr Point nine and Mr [inaudible],

671
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,990
Mr [inaudible] and Mr Point eight neither
of them thought there was much chance

672
00:40:22,991 --> 00:40:27,520
of getting down to here. Point nine
thought 1% squared. That's negligible.

673
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:32,670
Point eight thought 2% squared this 0.0
for the differences between negligible

674
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:37,600
and 0.04 still negligible practically.
So they hardly disagree here.

675
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,130
But once you get down to here,

676
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,130
they're both starting to get more
worried and they're actually deferring a

677
00:40:42,131 --> 00:40:43,630
little bit more than they did before.

678
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:47,470
So that's what I think happens in
these crises. You go from, you know,

679
00:40:47,471 --> 00:40:52,120
everyone knowing him for
about 25,025 things in a row
go wrong, we're in trouble.

680
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,130
But how many,
you know,

681
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:57,130
nobody's really thinking except the
guys at the very bottom that all of this

682
00:40:57,131 --> 00:41:00,340
stuff can go wrong.
But once each thing goes wrong,

683
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:04,060
now everyone gets more and more worried
and there's more separation between what

684
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:07,630
people think. Okay? So that's
just description of the model.

685
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:11,770
So what's going to happen is the question.
Okay.

686
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,130
So we're almost at the end here
because you don't have to do much more

687
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:17,110
calculations.
Um,

688
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:22,000
so what will the price is be
at the beginning and down here?

689
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:27,430
And what will the leverage be at
the beginning and down here? Well,

690
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:32,700
remember our principal that the leverage
will always be worked out in this case

691
00:41:33,711 --> 00:41:38,711
of heterogeneous beliefs
so that people can promise.

692
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,950
So there'll be no default.

693
00:41:39,951 --> 00:41:44,900
The maximum promises is the most you
can make without any chance of default.

694
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:47,840
So you can see that.

695
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:50,660
I'll tell you what the prices
are there going to be that.

696
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:55,430
So if you made a two period loan into,
you know,

697
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:58,730
along loan, a lot can go
wrong. Over long loan,

698
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,590
you can get all the way down to 0.2,

699
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:04,150
so you're not gonna be able to borrow
very much if you make a two period loan.

700
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,910
If you make a one period loan, you
know, in a day, not much can go wrong.

701
00:42:07,911 --> 00:42:10,730
That's why these repo markets
are so short in one day.

702
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,520
Practically nothing can go wrong
or hear something does go wrong,

703
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:17,720
but you can fall to 0.69 a
lot better than 0.2. Okay?

704
00:42:17,721 --> 00:42:20,270
So you could borrow at the beginning 0.69.

705
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:24,410
That'll be the equilibrium promise
at the beginning will be 0.69 with no

706
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:27,830
interest. The equilibrium promise
here will be 0.2 with no interest.

707
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:32,690
The equilibrium promise there will
be one with no interest. Okay,

708
00:42:32,691 --> 00:42:37,640
so, alright, so this turns out
to be the equilibrium. Why?

709
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,700
Notice how shocking it is.

710
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:45,710
Nobody thinks the price dropped
from 95 to 69 is justified.

711
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,990
That's a huge 26% drop.

712
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,520
Mr 87 he thought the price should go
from 98 to [inaudible] 87 that's an 11

713
00:42:52,521 --> 00:42:56,090
point drop. Mr One thought it
was worth one at the beginning.

714
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:00,110
He still thinks it's worth one.
That's no drug. Mr Z H equals zero.

715
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:03,740
Thought it was worth 0.2 at the beginning
and still thinks it's worth 0.2.

716
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,610
That's no drop Mr. I mean, no
wonder, no matter who you pick,

717
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:12,650
I think the worst one is 0.5. Point
five thought it was worth. Um,

718
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,330
we have to figure it out.
25% chance of going down here,

719
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,590
75 up there.

720
00:43:18,591 --> 00:43:23,591
So 0.75 plus a plus 0.5 is 0.8 right?

721
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:30,581
25% of 0.2 is a 0.05 so 0.75
so Mr h equals 0.5 things.

722
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:38,141
It's the expected payoff is 0.8 75%
of one of those ones and 25% of 0.2 is

723
00:43:40,371 --> 00:43:45,371
another 0.05 so 0.75 and 405 is 0.8 so
he thinks down here where he said 0.5

724
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:48,380
it's now worth 0.5 and 0.5 of this,

725
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:52,760
it's 0.6 so he thought the drops would
be from 80 to 60 a 20 point drop.

726
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:56,150
That's the biggest drop anybody
could imagine 20 points.

727
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:59,720
Most people are at 11 points or
zero points or something like that.

728
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:01,850
Nobody's at a 26 point drop.

729
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:07,210
That's way bigger than anybody could
imagine is justified by the bad news and

730
00:44:07,761 --> 00:44:11,090
the economy. Yet that's what
the equilibrium becomes. Okay.

731
00:44:11,091 --> 00:44:15,020
From 95% to 69% so why is that?

732
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:17,960
That's the end of the story.
What happened in the drop? Well,

733
00:44:17,961 --> 00:44:21,750
three things went wrong. Okay. In the Er.

734
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,580
So the first thing is that
87 is the marginal buyer.

735
00:44:25,581 --> 00:44:28,880
So everyone above him bought
all of these optimists.

736
00:44:28,881 --> 00:44:31,340
We're buying everyone else sold in London

737
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:34,780
money. Okay, now what?

738
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:40,360
I'm assuming that and it's going to
turn out to be the correct answer. Now,

739
00:44:40,361 --> 00:44:43,270
how did I know 87 well, I'll
tell you, you'll see at the end.

740
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:47,680
Yeah. Question. No, just
fixing your hair. That's okay.

741
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:54,400
Okay,
so 87% eight Mr 87 is the marginal buyer.

742
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:58,420
So those guys at the top Bot, now, how
could they afford to buy so much? Well,

743
00:44:58,421 --> 00:45:02,350
they're borrowing so much.
They're borrowing 0.69. Okay.

744
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:05,770
Plus they already had their 0.31.
So together they can borrow.

745
00:45:05,771 --> 00:45:10,771
If they can spend 0.69 plus 0.13
that's point 82 that they're uh,

746
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:18,780
it's point 82 that they're spending
and they're only buying 87.

747
00:45:19,151 --> 00:45:22,990
And so 82 or 87 is about 95.
So there's a little rounding going on.

748
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:27,730
So that's why the price is 0.95.
Now, why did it crash to 0.69?

749
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:32,710
It crashed because look what happened.
These total optimist at the beginning,

750
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:36,640
the top 13% they borrowed,
they spent all the money that they had.

751
00:45:36,641 --> 00:45:41,290
There are 13% cigarettes, uh,
uh, gold. They spent the 13%,

752
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:45,160
they borrowed everything they
could to the hilt. So they old 0.6,

753
00:45:45,161 --> 00:45:47,440
nine in both states.
So what happens to them here?

754
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:51,310
They spent all their gold and they all
the total value of their collateral.

755
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,680
They're wiped out here.
They've got nothing left.

756
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:58,690
So the most optimistic people in the
economy, they're just out of the economy.

757
00:45:58,691 --> 00:45:59,920
They've all gone bankrupt.

758
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:05,070
So now we've got a smaller population
with less optimistic people.

759
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,180
Okay? And so these, these new optimists
are going to do the buying now. Well,

760
00:46:10,181 --> 00:46:12,600
first of all, they don't think
the asset's worth as much for,

761
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:17,110
for a bunch of reasons. One is they
got bad news, so the people were left.

762
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:19,750
Don't think it's worth as much
as they did from the beginning.

763
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:23,380
Plus the most optimistic people at
the beginning aren't there either.

764
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,510
And then lastly,
and most importantly,

765
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:29,950
the people who are left can't borrow very
much money because the leverage at the

766
00:46:29,951 --> 00:46:34,951
beginning was 0.95 or 4.26 you could
borrow 69 so you had to pay down 0.26

767
00:46:36,611 --> 00:46:39,360
that's 3.6 leverage here.

768
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:43,810
The prices 0.69 you can only borrow
0.2 so you have to put 0.49 down.

769
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:48,850
The leverage is 1.4 so you went from three
and a half leverage to one and a half

770
00:46:48,851 --> 00:46:52,450
leverage. The leverage collapsed.
And so these guys who are left,

771
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:54,260
okay,

772
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:58,880
they're not as optimistic. They thems
themselves cause they've got bad news.

773
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:03,590
The most optimistic people are gone and
the people who want to do the bind can't

774
00:47:03,591 --> 00:47:06,980
borrow as much. So there are three
reasons that drives the price down.

775
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:10,010
The marginal buyer becomes a
much lower guy than before.

776
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:12,110
And so that's why the price is lower.

777
00:47:12,111 --> 00:47:17,111
It's not just the bad news because Mr 87
or you know would never have justified

778
00:47:17,511 --> 00:47:18,344
that drop.

779
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,640
It's because the thing has fallen
into more pessimistic hands.

780
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:28,040
So all those bankers and hedge funds who
bought all his mortgage securities at

781
00:47:28,041 --> 00:47:31,930
the beginning, they've been wiped out by
now. They're way up here. They can't buy.

782
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:36,130
They're much more sober. People who are
left, who also know we've had bad news,

783
00:47:36,131 --> 00:47:38,420
they're willing to pay less to begin
with them. There are fewer of, you know,

784
00:47:38,421 --> 00:47:41,050
on their warm pessimistic and
they can't borrow very much.

785
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,880
So the price drops for all those reasons.

786
00:47:42,881 --> 00:47:45,160
I think that's the essence of the crash.

787
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:49,750
Three reasons that the people going
bankrupt where the most optimistic buyers,

788
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:53,540
the second reason because the news
was bad. That's the first one.

789
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:58,480
Ruses bad optimistic buyers going up,
going out and the leverage collapsing.

790
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:02,130
Okay, so the price drops along way. It's,

791
00:48:02,131 --> 00:48:06,840
I'll end with one more slide and then
sum up the last slide is his question

792
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,190
about the classes of people. Okay. It's,

793
00:48:10,191 --> 00:48:12,570
it's a little different
now than it was before.

794
00:48:12,571 --> 00:48:16,380
There are different classes of people.
Okay, so let's just think about this.

795
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:21,210
Why was the marginal buyer,
Mr 87 I mean, after all,

796
00:48:21,211 --> 00:48:24,660
we just computed,
Mr 87 thinks the value of the assets.

797
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:27,750
98 not 95 he doesn't,
you know,

798
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,540
Mr 86 also thinks the price,

799
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:35,190
the value of the acid is 90 98 about,
so why didn't 86 by,

800
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,350
he was getting a good
deal at the beginning.

801
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:41,640
Why was an 86 buying when he
thinks it's worth 98 here,

802
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,760
Mr. Point eight six remember
is not supposed to buy.

803
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:50,340
He's going to buy the next time.
See you Mr 86 there's just,

804
00:48:50,341 --> 00:48:52,830
he's the cautious optimist.
Okay.

805
00:48:52,831 --> 00:48:57,360
Mr 86 there just below 87 he's
going to buy after the crash,

806
00:48:57,361 --> 00:49:01,020
but he's not buying now. So why is it
that he's not buying it at the beginning?

807
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:12,440
Well, so this is the only subtlety,
but you answered to your question,

808
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:16,310
Mr 86 says to himself, you
know, I can make a profit.

809
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:21,340
I think it's worth 98 and I only have to
pay 95 that's like a 3% expected return

810
00:49:22,221 --> 00:49:24,950
and I'm risk neutral. So that's
great. You know, if I'm right,

811
00:49:24,951 --> 00:49:28,640
it goes from 95 to a hundred I
can get 5% on the other hand,

812
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:32,300
maybe I should wait for the crash.
The crash comes, the thing is worth,

813
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:36,080
I don't have to pay 69 I can
get 40% return, you know,

814
00:49:36,081 --> 00:49:40,590
31 over 69 whatever that is,
I can get a 40% return. Um,

815
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:43,700
if there's a a crash,
wouldn't that be,

816
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:47,300
that's much better than
my 5% if I'm right.

817
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:52,120
So it looks so that guy is waiting to,
to make money in the crash.

818
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:57,030
So of course by waiting and buying in
the crash, he's helping to reduce the,

819
00:49:57,031 --> 00:50:01,270
the terrible calamity cause he's a buyer.
If we just had more people like that,

820
00:50:01,271 --> 00:50:03,400
I think that is Warren Buffet.
Okay.

821
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:08,140
I call them the cautious optimist all
the way down to Mr. Point seven for Mr.

822
00:50:08,141 --> 00:50:10,780
Point seven five for example.
Also think the things,

823
00:50:10,781 --> 00:50:15,190
the acid is worth more than 0.95 at the
beginning, but he doesn't buy either.

824
00:50:15,191 --> 00:50:17,500
So all these people,
the cautious optimist,

825
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,280
they're holding out for the crash and the
crash would be much worse without them,

826
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,580
but they don't eliminate the crash
because they're not enough of them.

827
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:27,700
So here are the three classes of
people you were thinking about.

828
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:30,710
They're not quite as optimistic.
They still think it's a good buy,

829
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:34,790
but they decide not to buy,
waiting for the crash.

830
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:38,360
Now how did I know that it would stop at
87 and [inaudible] 74 how did they get

831
00:50:38,361 --> 00:50:41,930
all those numbers? Well, I don't have time
to derive them. Those are the equations,

832
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,000
but I can explain it very simply.

833
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,840
You see thinking you're going to take
advantage of the crash means it must have

834
00:50:47,841 --> 00:50:51,470
a high h. You think of things, go here,
they're still going to end up okay.

835
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,540
That's why you think there's
a big profit opportunity.

836
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:55,430
But if your age is too high,

837
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,380
you don't think you're ever
going to get to the crash.

838
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:01,250
So you've only got this small intermediate
group of people, the Warren Buffet,

839
00:51:01,251 --> 00:51:05,090
like people who are optimistic enough
to think that we're going to pull out of

840
00:51:05,091 --> 00:51:07,310
our depression.
You know,

841
00:51:07,311 --> 00:51:12,311
pull out of the crash and still there's
a profit opportunity and yet think that

842
00:51:12,561 --> 00:51:15,380
the crash is likely enough
so that they'll wait for it.

843
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:19,790
People who think they'll make a bigger
profit higher h once the crash starts,

844
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:22,250
well they don't even think the
crash is going to happen. Okay.

845
00:51:22,251 --> 00:51:25,000
So I've made a big assumption
that if you start with, you know,

846
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:29,180
the people with high h has always had
high ages. Okay. But I think that's life.

847
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:31,460
I think that's not a bad assumption.

848
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:35,690
I every hedge fund guy I've ever talked
to who thought that this was a low

849
00:51:35,691 --> 00:51:38,840
probability event also thought we are
going to come out of it and things

850
00:51:38,841 --> 00:51:42,950
wouldn't be that bad. Okay. So I'm not
saying that these people don't learn.

851
00:51:42,951 --> 00:51:45,500
Everybody learns when they see
the first piece of bad news.

852
00:51:45,501 --> 00:51:48,950
They're more pessimistic. You'd
go from, from uh, you know, 1.6,

853
00:51:48,951 --> 00:51:53,120
9% to 13%. So it's not like people
are learning, they are learning.

854
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:57,110
But relative to the rest of the
population, if you started optimistic,

855
00:51:57,111 --> 00:51:58,010
you stay optimistic.

856
00:51:58,011 --> 00:52:01,730
And that's why there's only a small group
of Warren Buffet's who could save the

857
00:52:01,731 --> 00:52:03,170
situation.
All right?

858
00:52:03,171 --> 00:52:08,000
So that's my model of the leverage
cycle of what happens. You know,

859
00:52:08,001 --> 00:52:11,390
three bad things happen,
bad news can't do anything about that.

860
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:15,170
The leverage buyers get crushed,
go out of business and,

861
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,700
and leverage collapses. So if you,
and when the prices are really low,

862
00:52:19,701 --> 00:52:23,330
the whole economy is suffering
tremendously and innocent
people who had nothing

863
00:52:23,331 --> 00:52:27,320
to do with all these markets, the
price of everything, every acid is low.

864
00:52:27,321 --> 00:52:30,890
So they can't borrow, they can't
get loans. Margins are so tough.

865
00:52:30,891 --> 00:52:33,920
They're small businesses. They can't
borrow there. Totally crushed down here.

866
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:39,080
So how would we save the economy?
We'd undo the three things that happen.

867
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:42,770
We'd have to,
we can't undo the bad news,

868
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,920
but the three things that
happened were uncertainty went up.

869
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:48,530
It wasn't just bad news.
It was scary. Bad News.

870
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:53,060
So this ans this gap between one and
0.2 is much bigger than that gap.

871
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,150
That's why the leverage went down.
Volatility went up.

872
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:00,470
So you have to contain the bad
news. Okay? That would help.

873
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:04,700
You have to contain the bad news. That's
a, so you can't eliminate the bad news,

874
00:53:04,701 --> 00:53:08,120
but you can contain the volatility
of the bad news. Secondly,

875
00:53:08,121 --> 00:53:11,000
you have to increase the leverage.
And thirdly,

876
00:53:11,001 --> 00:53:13,810
you have to make up for the people
who've gotten destroyed. You know, the,

877
00:53:13,811 --> 00:53:18,020
the buying power has gone
somehow the government has
to replace that temporarily.

878
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:20,330
So those are the three things
we should be doing now.

879
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,530
And in the long run we should never
have let leverage gets so high up here.

880
00:53:24,531 --> 00:53:26,640
That's what made the
price so high up here.

881
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:29,670
And that's why everyone got wiped out
down here cause they were borrowing so

882
00:53:29,671 --> 00:53:31,260
much.
We should never have let that happen.

883
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,530
So if we regulate the economy
not to let leverage get so high,

884
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:38,100
we won't have such a cry crash.
But if we do have a crash,

885
00:53:38,101 --> 00:53:40,860
the way to deal with it is to undo
the three things that went wrong.

886
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:44,550
That's the sort of story that
I've been telling you. Yes.

887
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:50,490
Okay. So what are they?
That's a wonderful question.

888
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:53,190
And of course I've been asked that before,

889
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:56,220
so let me put it in
several different ways.

890
00:53:56,370 --> 00:54:00,390
Let's take the most hyper
critical way. Um, some people,

891
00:54:00,391 --> 00:54:04,830
so I presented this theory, remember
starting in 2000, so way before the crash.

892
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:09,720
And so people would say then,
oh, very nice, very cute.
But you know, first of all,

893
00:54:09,721 --> 00:54:11,670
there's not going to be a crash.
And secondly,

894
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,860
how could we ever know what the
right amount of leverage is?

895
00:54:13,861 --> 00:54:18,630
It's an impossible pie in the sky
goal to regulate leverage. Okay,

896
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:23,070
well you see, that's why. So I say,
that's why I say it's difficult.

897
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:26,790
I agree. But we've already faced this
problem. We regulate the interest rate.

898
00:54:26,791 --> 00:54:30,120
How does the Fed know that the
interest rates too low or too high?

899
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:33,870
What the Fed does is it monitors a
bunch of stuff and realizes, you know,

900
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:37,170
the economies overheat, things
are changing. Suddenly price,

901
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:41,310
suddenly output is going way up
and inflation is starting to go up.

902
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:44,760
Then the Fed raises the interest rate
or maybe people are being thrown out of

903
00:54:44,761 --> 00:54:48,780
work. Then the Fed lowers the interest
rate. So something changes in the economy.

904
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:52,990
They don't know. So precisely you know
what to do, but something's changed.

905
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:55,950
That gives them a clue about
which way to move interest rates.

906
00:54:55,951 --> 00:54:59,910
And over the course of 80 years of, I
guess since the depression, you know,

907
00:54:59,911 --> 00:55:03,150
since those created over
70 or 80 years since then,

908
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,800
they've gotten better and better at, at,
at regulating the interest rate. Okay.

909
00:55:07,801 --> 00:55:11,990
So I put this picture up for a reason.
Uh,

910
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:14,880
last class, you remember
the reason, the picture,

911
00:55:14,881 --> 00:55:19,800
which I'm going to get to now I'm
of the history of leverage. Okay?

912
00:55:19,801 --> 00:55:24,150
So here's the history of leverage.
The purple in the housing market,

913
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:28,860
and then the, uh, blue is the history
of leverage. You know, the, the,

914
00:55:28,861 --> 00:55:31,470
it's the loan to value
basically, or the, you know,

915
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,650
I've put money down starting
from the top and going down.

916
00:55:34,651 --> 00:55:36,720
So it's really from the bottom,
it's loan to value.

917
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:41,640
So I've got the history of loan to value
in the securities market and in the

918
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:43,770
mortgage market.
Now,

919
00:55:43,771 --> 00:55:48,120
I think that the Fed should be monitoring
this and not only should be monitoring,

920
00:55:48,121 --> 00:55:50,640
it should be making it as public
as the interest rates are.

921
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:55,850
So how come I had to present Ellington's
data on observations it made in the

922
00:55:56,191 --> 00:56:00,900
market because Ellington seems to have
been the only company in the country that

923
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:02,910
kept this data.

924
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:06,570
Nobody else seemed to recognize how
important it was and we kept it so the Fed

925
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:09,900
doesn't have this, this, these
numbers going back. If it did,

926
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:14,910
it would have seen that leverage had
suddenly jumped up here and that leverage

927
00:56:14,911 --> 00:56:16,680
was much higher than it was before.

928
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:19,620
And it would see if it monitored
leverage in the housing market.

929
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:22,530
That leverage was skyrocketing. I
mean, of course everybody knew this,

930
00:56:22,531 --> 00:56:24,760
they just didn't think it was an
important thing to pay attention to.

931
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,580
But if they were paying attention
to it and keeping those numbers,

932
00:56:27,581 --> 00:56:30,160
we had to do this at Ellington
by going house, by house,

933
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:33,580
through every house looking at what the
leverage was and taking the average.

934
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:37,780
If they had done that, I mean they could
have done that easily. And if they were,

935
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:41,380
if they did do that and if there were
publishing it and everyone in the every

936
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:44,650
economist was aware of it, I think
things would have been very different.

937
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:49,180
They would've said, you know, we ought
to, to, to tighten leverage, you know,

938
00:56:49,181 --> 00:56:51,850
exactly how much should we tighten it.
While they would have said,

939
00:56:51,851 --> 00:56:52,930
I don't know exactly,

940
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:57,840
but we would have forced banks not to
allow loans with 3% down, you know,

941
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:01,150
shouldn't be 10% or 15% or 8%.

942
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:03,550
It's a little hard to say what
exactly the right number is,

943
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:07,390
but we would have picked a number higher
than 3% and we would have avoided a

944
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:10,210
huge problem. Um, and you know,

945
00:57:10,211 --> 00:57:12,760
in later years we'll get better
and better at picking that number.

946
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:15,790
So I'm trying to answer your question.
Um,

947
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:19,510
so in the securities market,
another thing you could do,

948
00:57:19,511 --> 00:57:21,520
another trick you could
do is you could say,

949
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:26,680
we'll pass a rule that says you can't
hear leverage is going down, right?

950
00:57:26,681 --> 00:57:28,450
They're asking for more and more margins.

951
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,010
You could pass a rule that
says you can't double your,

952
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,090
your margins,
you know,

953
00:57:34,091 --> 00:57:37,660
from 10% to 20% or 20 to 40.

954
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:41,710
You can't double them in
under four months. Say,

955
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:45,310
so that would on average
across some security class,

956
00:57:45,311 --> 00:57:48,010
you can't double them in
less than four months.

957
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:50,380
Well or less than six months.

958
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:55,210
So that would have kept leverage
from collapsing so fast.

959
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:59,080
And then lenders knowing that when
the crisis was starting, you know,

960
00:57:59,081 --> 00:58:00,430
they're making one day loans,

961
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,060
they always think of what's a one day
loan and things start to look dicey.

962
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:07,990
I'll just demand a huge amount of leverage
the next day I'll get my money back

963
00:58:07,991 --> 00:58:10,900
tomorrow and then the day after tomorrow,
I'm not going to make the same loan.

964
00:58:10,901 --> 00:58:14,800
I'll ask for a lot more margin. So I'm
saying, suppose you tell them an advance,

965
00:58:14,801 --> 00:58:18,220
you have to keep making the same
loan and you can't double the margin,

966
00:58:18,221 --> 00:58:21,040
you can increase it. But if you have to
take at least six months to double it,

967
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:24,400
well they'll know in advance that they're
not going to be able to react very

968
00:58:24,401 --> 00:58:29,170
quickly to problems. And so on advanced
they'll ask for more margin down.

969
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,340
So you know,

970
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:33,610
they won't have to double to get to a
safe level when something starts happening

971
00:58:33,611 --> 00:58:34,840
because they'll already be safer.

972
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:39,370
So that's a way of not having to actually
know what the right number is by just

973
00:58:39,371 --> 00:58:43,720
slowing down their response and
relying them to anticipate, you know,

974
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,590
how bad things might be in the already
starting to respond to the beginning.

975
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:50,560
Okay. So I'm not saying I've got
exactly the right formula, but you see,

976
00:58:50,561 --> 00:58:53,050
I think if you think about
it and start to work on this,

977
00:58:53,051 --> 00:58:55,330
and most importantly you
make these numbers public,

978
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,770
you're going to change the way
everybody, you know, other people will,

979
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:00,040
rules will develop.

980
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:06,030
Yeah.
Are they going to set one leverage rate?

981
00:59:06,031 --> 00:59:08,100
Which or is it going to
be like for each class?

982
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,070
Yes. Each class of security
will have a different leverage.

983
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:13,900
Okay. So, so when you say classic
security, like what do you,

984
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:18,260
I mean like, uh, you know, uh,

985
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,580
well the government already makes a lot
of loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,

986
00:59:22,581 --> 00:59:26,090
but Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will have
to ask for at least 20% down. You know,

987
00:59:26,091 --> 00:59:28,340
prime securities will
have prime mortgages,

988
00:59:28,341 --> 00:59:31,100
will have to have at least
this much amount of money down.

989
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:32,750
So you're on the housing market,

990
00:59:32,751 --> 00:59:35,960
you'll have to have a certain
amount of money down on treasuries.

991
00:59:35,961 --> 00:59:40,250
You can have a very high leverage
on mortgage and mortgages,

992
00:59:40,251 --> 00:59:43,820
plain simple mortgages. You can have
not quite as quite as high a leverage,

993
00:59:43,821 --> 00:59:47,750
but you know, some, uh, you
know, uh, pretty high leverage
on mortgage derivatives,

994
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:51,110
which are much more complicated.
The leverage has to be much less.

995
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:55,010
So you might say, you know,
there'll be some rule that says, um,

996
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:57,190
so anyway,

997
00:59:57,190 --> 01:00:00,740
those are the kinds of classes that I
have in mind and we have to work out

998
01:00:00,741 --> 01:00:04,040
exactly how the, uh, you know,
how they're going to be regulated.

999
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:07,130
So it's a little bit comp. So let me
answer your question two parts. Yes.

1000
01:00:07,131 --> 01:00:10,400
It has to depend on the
kind of security and B,

1001
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:12,530
even trying to answer your question,

1002
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:16,040
I'm revealing that is not so obvious
exactly what the formula is and how to do

1003
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:18,260
it, but this has to be worked out. Yup.

1004
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,053
Oh,

1005
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:28,960
okay.

1006
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,770
Yeah. Well I think, yes, yes.

1007
01:00:32,771 --> 01:00:36,940
I think that's the whole point of the
crisis that the uh, the things, uh,

1008
01:00:36,941 --> 01:00:39,790
feedback on each other.
The feedback is the most important thing.

1009
01:00:39,791 --> 01:00:44,260
So in the crisis, uh, let's do take
any one of these, when the price went,

1010
01:00:44,261 --> 01:00:48,430
when leverage starts to go down,
that makes the prices start to go down.

1011
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:49,990
But when the prices start to go down,

1012
01:00:49,991 --> 01:00:52,660
people get more worried that things
are going to go down further. I mean,

1013
01:00:52,661 --> 01:00:55,300
they have good reason to worry and
so the leverage goes down more,

1014
01:00:55,301 --> 01:00:58,750
which makes the prices go down more.
And so they feed back on each other.

1015
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:03,520
So definitely there it's, it's a
bad, it's a spiral of one thing, uh,

1016
01:01:03,521 --> 01:01:06,190
affecting the other. And of course
the more the prices are going down,

1017
01:01:06,191 --> 01:01:08,650
the more the optimist are losing money.
And so your most,

1018
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:12,130
your best buyers are getting wiped
out. And that's a third thing. That's,

1019
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:14,800
those three things are always
feeding back on each other.

1020
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:19,463
Okay.

1021
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:25,720
No, because the model was
totally rational. Every
person did expect all this.

1022
01:01:25,721 --> 01:01:28,300
Everyone anticipated
perfectly what would happen.

1023
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:32,290
So there's no Lucas and the Lucas
Critique is, you know, if you,

1024
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,860
people will realize they're
in a different, uh, you know,

1025
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:37,870
people should realize the environment
they're in. But here in this,

1026
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:39,190
in this environment,

1027
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:43,720
everybody up here understood from the
very beginning that the prices were going

1028
01:01:43,721 --> 01:01:48,430
to go down to 0.6, nine, they
realized that there was going
to be this, uh, this, uh,

1029
01:01:48,431 --> 01:01:50,020
acceleration of problems.

1030
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:54,400
And so they all anticipated but still
they wanted to buy because they didn't

1031
01:01:54,401 --> 01:01:55,500
think they were going to get down there.

1032
01:01:55,520 --> 01:02:00,220
They thought they were going to go
up here. So remember my, uh, my, uh,

1033
01:02:00,221 --> 01:02:01,930
I don't know if I have it in this slide,

1034
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:07,030
but one of my most amazing
pictures was this one of a,

1035
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:09,260
uh,
uh,

1036
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:16,100
was the, what happened to the market
open. So what happened to the market here,

1037
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:19,680
which I think I've showed you
as time. I mean, know I did,

1038
01:02:19,681 --> 01:02:22,320
but I'll just show it to you again.
Now with this new perspective,

1039
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:25,080
you can look at it, uh, presents.

1040
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:26,530
Yeah.

1041
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:30,790
So this is a, this is Jerusalem.
I gave this talk in Jerusalem.

1042
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,333
Yeah.

1043
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:36,860
Okay.
Second

1044
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:37,813
Talk.

1045
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:41,120
Okay.
So you remember this picture?

1046
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:52,640
Hope it wasn't this lie. This. Yes,
it was he earth here. I'll get,

1047
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:54,350
remember what happened in the world.

1048
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,770
It was shocking how bad
and how fast it was.

1049
01:02:57,771 --> 01:03:02,771
So in 2007 beginning of 2007 Oh,

1050
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:04,310
that's right.

1051
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:08,030
We're not far from the beginning
of 2007 that's three years ago.

1052
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:12,710
People were expecting 40%
losses for these lower tronches.

1053
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:17,810
Okay, so how could you get
such an astronomical loss?
You know what was happening?

1054
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:21,070
They were already anticipating
this spiral. You know,

1055
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:24,680
if you looked at just what housing
prices were there and you say, okay,

1056
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:27,050
30% guys being thrown out,
you know,

1057
01:03:27,051 --> 01:03:31,460
and housing prices are down 4% that's
hardly any loss at all because if you get

1058
01:03:31,461 --> 01:03:36,461
96% back on the house and you have a few
expenses and only 30% are defaulting,

1059
01:03:36,471 --> 01:03:39,190
first of all, they probably, you know,
there was hardly anybody to faulting.

1060
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,830
Remember that curves we show we're
through almost any losses and no one going

1061
01:03:42,831 --> 01:03:44,200
delinquent yet.
So what?

1062
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:47,510
They already anticipated that there were
going to be lots of people thrown out

1063
01:03:47,511 --> 01:03:49,400
of their houses and when they
got thrown out of their houses,

1064
01:03:49,401 --> 01:03:51,170
the housing prices were going to collapse.

1065
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:55,670
So this market was collapsing already
because people were anticipating all the,

1066
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:58,340
you know, a lot of the feedbacks and
stuff that we're going to happen later.

1067
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:00,890
They didn't just extrapolate
the number of the faults.

1068
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:04,310
They also had to extrapolate the
housing prices and stuff going down.

1069
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:05,870
And so in this model,

1070
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:10,910
everybody is doing that complicated
extrapolation and they're getting it,

1071
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:11,763
uh,

1072
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:17,110
know they're doing this complicated
extrapolation and they're figuring it all

1073
01:04:17,111 --> 01:04:18,310
out.
But even so,

1074
01:04:18,311 --> 01:04:21,490
they still want to put themselves in
the cycle because they still think they

1075
01:04:21,491 --> 01:04:24,640
have a profit opportunity.
They can't stop themselves for investing.

1076
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,550
That's why you need regulation.
It's like a prisoner's dilemma.

1077
01:04:27,551 --> 01:04:29,110
Everybody knows what the danger is.

1078
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,320
They still want to do it and the
only way to stop them from doing it,

1079
01:04:32,321 --> 01:04:35,290
you can't lecture them about,
you know, irrational exuberance.

1080
01:04:35,650 --> 01:04:37,840
They know what's going to happen
and they still want to do it.

1081
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:39,520
They don't think that's going to happen.

1082
01:04:39,521 --> 01:04:41,920
They know what could happen and
they still want to do it now.

1083
01:04:41,921 --> 01:04:45,940
I think in reality Schiller's got
something to Oh is partly right.

1084
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,120
I think that people didn't really
realize how bad it could have gotten.

1085
01:04:49,121 --> 01:04:51,310
My own hedge fund lost money,
you know,

1086
01:04:51,311 --> 01:04:54,520
we didn't anticipate how bad it was
because there's so many things went wrong.

1087
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,490
We just underestimated all the feedbacks.
So there,

1088
01:04:57,491 --> 01:05:00,520
there is the spiral and they were
just more things going wrong than we

1089
01:05:00,521 --> 01:05:03,730
anticipated. So I wouldn't stick
a hundred percent of my story.

1090
01:05:03,731 --> 01:05:06,130
I think there's something
to what Schiller says,

1091
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:11,020
but I wouldn't definitely stick to 100%
of his story of it being all irrational

1092
01:05:11,021 --> 01:05:12,940
exuberance.
Okay.

1093
01:05:12,941 --> 01:05:17,430
Any other questions now that
we have five minutes for?

1094
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:20,850
Um, so I'm willing to keep
going for it. It's all,

1095
01:05:20,851 --> 01:05:24,760
it's just pause for any more questions
on this story of the crisis or anything

1096
01:05:24,761 --> 01:05:26,770
else about the crisis you want to ask or,

1097
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:29,143
Yup.

1098
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:37,670
Um, well that's a good
question. So I, I, I'm,

1099
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:41,780
I talked to them now all the time,
so they, whereas I never did before.

1100
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:46,310
So our meeting Dudley, uh, tomorrow,
he's the head of the New York Fed.

1101
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:50,150
Um,
so I go there quite frequently,

1102
01:05:50,151 --> 01:05:53,630
like once a month now. And
it's, I'm on some panels,

1103
01:05:53,631 --> 01:05:57,410
there are other academics going to,
so, you know, I didn't do that before.

1104
01:05:57,411 --> 01:06:00,980
So clearly they're paying attention to it.
I think that a lot of,

1105
01:06:00,981 --> 01:06:03,770
there are other people saying
that leverages important.

1106
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:08,980
Soros being a famous hedge
fund person who says it.

1107
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:12,350
Uh, there are other people saying
that you should reduce principal.

1108
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:15,860
Remember I said that the way to solve
the housing foreclosure problems reducing

1109
01:06:15,861 --> 01:06:20,320
principal, they're now holding hearings
in Congress. Uh, I suppose, uh, you know,

1110
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:24,140
I could've gone Tuesday to testify,
but I have already testified,

1111
01:06:24,141 --> 01:06:26,270
but they're having another
other hearings now.

1112
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:30,410
I didn't go because I
was teaching, but on, um,

1113
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:33,860
but there are a lot of people who went
and a lot of people said we should reduce

1114
01:06:33,861 --> 01:06:36,110
principal.
And a year ago when I was saying that,

1115
01:06:36,111 --> 01:06:38,510
hardly anyone else was saying it,
although there were, there were others.

1116
01:06:38,511 --> 01:06:41,450
But very few, uh, my
people at my hedge fund,

1117
01:06:41,451 --> 01:06:44,960
we all pretty much a cid CII on this and
some other hedge funds were saying that.

1118
01:06:44,961 --> 01:06:49,880
But now I think there's a
growing consensus that we
have to reduce principal.

1119
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:50,780
What does that do?

1120
01:06:50,781 --> 01:06:55,430
It makes the loan smaller relative to
the value of the house. In other words,

1121
01:06:55,431 --> 01:06:59,330
it reduces the leverage
of, of of homeowners. Okay.

1122
01:06:59,331 --> 01:07:04,010
So we have to get back to uh,
uh, credible level of leverage.

1123
01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:05,780
So,
um,

1124
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:11,240
the bad news is that although they're
very receptive and although they're

1125
01:07:11,241 --> 01:07:13,760
listening carefully and they
keep inviting me to speak,

1126
01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:16,400
I don't see much signs that
they're doing anything.

1127
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:20,510
And the one thing that they should have
done by now is collected all this data.

1128
01:07:20,511 --> 01:07:24,170
So they should have gone to all the big
lenders and said the Fed should have and

1129
01:07:24,171 --> 01:07:25,004
said,

1130
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:29,960
this is the margins we're charging on
all our different securities and heres a,

1131
01:07:29,961 --> 01:07:30,920
you know,
here they are.

1132
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:34,100
And then the Fed would be able to monitor
how much they were going up and down.

1133
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:38,120
Now a bunch of these lenders themselves
have also become excited about what I'm

1134
01:07:38,121 --> 01:07:42,800
doing and they're starting for publish
reports about it. So one, Credit Suisse,

1135
01:07:42,801 --> 01:07:44,720
for example, they, they,

1136
01:07:44,721 --> 01:07:49,370
their research department now thinks that
a better measure of money is not just

1137
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:51,530
m one and m two and all that stuff.

1138
01:07:51,531 --> 01:07:56,180
But how many loans leverage loans are
made in the repo market and they add that

1139
01:07:56,181 --> 01:07:59,090
to the money supply and they think
that gives a much better picture of the

1140
01:07:59,091 --> 01:08:01,820
economy.
So it's all sort of based on these ideas.

1141
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,940
And I think I got them interested in it
or was one of the people that got them

1142
01:08:04,941 --> 01:08:05,774
interested in it,

1143
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:09,920
but they aren't going to publish their
leverage numbers unless everybody else

1144
01:08:09,921 --> 01:08:13,820
does because why should they give away
private information? Why should they say,

1145
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,860
you know,
we're lending Ellington on slightly more,

1146
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:21,050
less generous or more generous terms.
Then we're lending to some other guy.

1147
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:24,590
One of the two of us is going to feel
bad about it and so they're not going to

1148
01:08:24,591 --> 01:08:25,310
do that.

1149
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:29,120
And so the government is the only one
that can get the information out of them

1150
01:08:29,121 --> 01:08:32,720
and the government shouldn't say who
are they lending to? Person by person.

1151
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:34,010
They should give the average number.

1152
01:08:34,011 --> 01:08:36,080
This is the average margin
they're charging people.

1153
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,930
The average number of the banks
in general are charging people.

1154
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:42,800
Then you won't be able to re, you won't
be revealing any private information,

1155
01:08:42,801 --> 01:08:43,910
giving away any secrets.

1156
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:47,930
So that's the worst news that
they're not collecting the data yet.

1157
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,550
And it's shocking to me.
So I've had many times,

1158
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,820
so I'm gonna yell at Dudley
about that again Friday,

1159
01:08:52,821 --> 01:08:55,280
but I've done it before so
hopefully they're going to do that.

1160
01:08:55,281 --> 01:08:57,440
They say they're going to do that.
So I believe they'll do that.

1161
01:08:57,441 --> 01:08:59,630
And I believe that once
they have all these numbers,

1162
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:04,330
they're going to start to
think differently. Um, so
there are all these, um, the,

1163
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:08,720
there's all these initiatives in Congress
and in the Fed and in the treasury to

1164
01:09:08,721 --> 01:09:11,460
try and monitor leverage
and try to regulate it. But,

1165
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:14,210
but every time they get down
to actually doing something,

1166
01:09:14,211 --> 01:09:18,530
they ask questions like you did,
what exactly should the rule be?

1167
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:22,010
And they seem paralyzed by not being
able to figure out the exact rule.

1168
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:22,611
But I don't,

1169
01:09:22,611 --> 01:09:26,510
I think that's an unnecessary paralysis
because we don't have to have the final

1170
01:09:26,511 --> 01:09:28,400
rule to start doing stuff.
Yes.

1171
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:34,190
The Fed,
the Fed has the power to do it.

1172
01:09:34,191 --> 01:09:38,030
The Fed already regulates
margins on stocks, right?

1173
01:09:38,031 --> 01:09:40,130
They set the margin of 50% or something,

1174
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:43,130
and so they could change that and
they have changed that in the past,

1175
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:47,000
so they should change.
So the Fed has the authority to do that.

1176
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:51,020
The Fed did that after nine 11
and called everybody up and said,

1177
01:09:51,021 --> 01:09:54,200
right after nine 11 and said,
you cannot change your margins.

1178
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:56,750
And nobody changed their margins.
I mean,

1179
01:09:56,751 --> 01:09:59,840
if ever there was a day when people
were nervous and wanted to have a higher

1180
01:09:59,841 --> 01:10:03,830
margin, it was on nine 12.
Nobody changed their margins.

1181
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,520
So they've done it before.
Um, but, but you know,

1182
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:10,400
that's a pretty extreme day.
