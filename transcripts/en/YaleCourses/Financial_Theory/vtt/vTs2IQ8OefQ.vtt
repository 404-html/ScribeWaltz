1
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.370
So anyway,
the course I'm going to teach is called financial theory.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.250
And I'm going to talk about,
I'm going to teach an actual class.

3
00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:11.250
I'm gonna spend the first half of the class talking about the course and why you

4
00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:13.560
might be interested in it.
And then I'm going to start with the chorus.

5
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:16.800
I'm going to not that many lectures available in the semester,

6
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:18.300
so I'm not going to waste this one.

7
00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:21.360
So the first half the class is going to be about why to study it and the

8
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:25.020
mechanics of the course and the second half of the lecture is going to be

9
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:26.580
actually the first part of the course.

10
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:29.940
They'll give you maybe an idea of whether you'll find the course interesting
too.

11
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.220
So,
um,

12
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.510
I think I'll turn this won't have too much power point here.

13
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.780
So you should know that finance was not taught until 10 years ago at Yale.

14
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.940
It was regarded by the deans and the classically minded faculty of the arts and

15
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:50.460
sciences as a vocational subject,

16
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:55.020
not worthy of being taught to Yale undergraduate.
Um,

17
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.130
it was growing more and more famous,
however,
in the world.

18
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:02.430
And there was a band of business school professors,

19
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.870
Fisher Black Robert Merton,
William Sharpe,

20
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.620
Steve Ross,
Myron shoals,
Merton Miller,

21
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.120
who had a huge following in business schools teaching the subject and who

22
00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:19.200
students went off on to Wall Street and more or less dominated the investment

23
00:01:19.201 --> 00:01:23.910
banking,
uh,
parts of Wall Street and became extremely successful.

24
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.340
Uh,
finance became the most highly paid profession.

25
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:33.150
It became those highly paid faculty in the university,

26
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:35.010
although they were all in business schools.

27
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.750
They're more physics PhDs working in finance now than there are working in

28
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:41.610
physics.
Um,

29
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.660
so this merry band of financial theory,

30
00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:48.360
professors didn't really believe in regulation.

31
00:01:48.361 --> 00:01:53.340
They believed markets left unfettered,
uh,
work best of all.

32
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.770
They believed in what they call the efficient markets.

33
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.150
And the idea that acid prices reflect all the available possible information.

34
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.560
So an implication of that is that if you want to find out whether a company's

35
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.530
doing well or not,

36
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.470
you don't have to take the trouble to read all their financial boards.

37
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.030
Just look at their stock price.

38
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.460
If you wanted to know whether a country is doing well or not,

39
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.600
you don't have to study its entire political system.
And,
uh,
you know,

40
00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:16.434
current events,

41
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.640
just look at the general stock market of the country and that will tell you they

42
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:25.320
believe that you could make as good returns in the market as a lay person,

43
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:28.740
as you could as an expert because all the experts were competing to try and get

44
00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:29.910
the best possible price.

45
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.080
And so the price itself reflected all their knowledge and wisdom and opinions.

46
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.410
And so the lay person could take advantage of that by buying stocks.

47
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.950
Everybody should be an investor.
They felt,
uh,

48
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.530
a monkey throwing darts at a dart board would do as well as any of the greatest

49
00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:46.560
experts.
Now,
their own theory was

50
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.930
basically contradicted by their own experience because all of them seem to go

51
00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:53.850
out into the world,
uh,
and,

52
00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:57.930
and invest in almost all of the mating extraordinary returns and made a huge

53
00:02:57.931 --> 00:02:58.764
amount of money,

54
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.160
all of which made them even less popular in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

55
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.470
So a critical part of their theory was that the markets are so efficient,

56
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.670
driven by people like them who are competing to exploit every advantage and

57
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:15.970
therefore compete away every advantage.
And by doing that,
uh,

58
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.640
put all the information they have into the prices.

59
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.650
The implication of that theory is that there's an extraordinarily clever way of

60
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:28.480
computing the value of most investment assets and about deciding when a

61
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:30.730
financial decision is a good thing to do or not.

62
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.420
And that was the heart of what they taught in these business schools,

63
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:39.040
these algorithms for valuing assets and making optimal financial decisions.

64
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.180
Uh,

65
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.180
one striking thing is that the people they studied the business school,

66
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.110
the,
the,
uh,
the business people and the investment bankers,
they studied,

67
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.180
adopted their language.
So this had never happened in academia before.
I mean,

68
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:57.340
anthropologists study,
you know,

69
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.330
primitive tribes and different kinds of people all the time.

70
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.280
And not one of them I'd venture to say,

71
00:04:03.281 --> 00:04:07.270
has ever taken over all the language invented by anthropologists to behave

72
00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:09.550
themselves in their own societies.

73
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.130
But the business people that these professors were studying ended up using

74
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:19.720
exactly the language created,
uh,
in academia.
Now,

75
00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:20.800
Yale was very different.

76
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:25.801
There was no divide between economist and a finance people.

77
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.820
All these other,
you know,
the business school finance people in,
at,
at Yale,

78
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.950
the greatest economist and yells history.

79
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.620
We're actually very interested in finance.

80
00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:37.450
Maybe there were financial economist to begin with.

81
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:41.630
So the greatest Yale economist and the first half of the 20th century was Irving

82
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.090
Fisher.
You hear a lot about,

83
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.930
he wrote possibly the first economics phd at Yale.

84
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.330
There was no economist to teach him,
so he had to write his phd with Gibbs.
Uh,

85
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.340
the great,
maybe the greatest American physicist of the time.

86
00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:58.840
There's a building as you know,
and science hill named after Gibbs.
And,

87
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.680
uh,
you'll,
you'll hear more about his dissertation and the 1890s,

88
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.340
but he was a mathematical economist and econometrician,

89
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.270
but he invented almost all of his economics in order to study finance.

90
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.710
The most famous yellow economist of the second half of the 20th century was

91
00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:18.310
James Tobin,
a famous macro economist.
Uh,

92
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.050
the most famous macro economist,

93
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:24.550
possibly of the 22nd half of the 20th century after Keynes,
a great Keynesian,

94
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.110
but he got the Nobel prize for work he did on finance and economics.

95
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.480
Finance was incredibly interesting to him.

96
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.580
So Bob Shiller and I went to Yale and we basically said to the deans,

97
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.410
there's a long tradition of finance and economics hand in hand,

98
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.390
um,
at Yale.
And so it's not a vocational subject.

99
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:50.320
It's actually central to economics and central to understanding the economy in

100
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:52.240
central to understanding the global economy.

101
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.710
So we'd like to teach it to Yale undergraduates and we believe a few of them

102
00:05:56.711 --> 00:06:00.980
will actually take the course.
And so they agreed to let us do it.

103
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:04.520
And so what we've been teaching it now for the,
for the last 10 years,

104
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.910
so as you know,
um,
Schiller is very,

105
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:12.240
has been very critical of the business,
uh,

106
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.960
efficient markets tradition.
Uh,

107
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.250
he feels that these finance professors left something essential out of the whole

108
00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:22.070
story.
What they left out was psychology.

109
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:26.840
They left out the idea of fads and uh,
rumors,
a narratives which they thought,

110
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:31.841
which he thinks has as big an effect on prices as the hard information about

111
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:36.950
profits that the business school professors imagine drove profits.
Um,

112
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.710
I myself have been quite critical of the financial theory.

113
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.130
I started off as a straight,

114
00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:50.480
pure mathematical economist.
Um,
it,
to me,

115
00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:54.740
economics is almost a branch of logic and philosophy that happened to tell you

116
00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:57.100
something about the world.
Um,

117
00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.610
so I got my phd with Ken Arrow who you'll hear a lot about very shortly.

118
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.940
And I came to Yale.
Uh,
I'd been a Yale undergraduate.

119
00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:08.660
I came back to Yale and I joined the Coles Foundation.

120
00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:11.180
And the coulds foundation's motto was basically,

121
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.890
can we make economics more mathematical economics?

122
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.640
Social Science ought to be,
uh,

123
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:23.730
amenable to mathematical analysis just like physics or chemistry is.

124
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.250
And people didn't believe this at first.
And the coulds foundation,
uh,

125
00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:32.720
which you'll hear a lot about in these lectures,
led the revolution in economics,

126
00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:37.640
transforming it from a,
a,
a verbal subject,

127
00:07:37.641 --> 00:07:41.330
political economy into a mathematical subject.
Well,

128
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:46.390
I decided around 1989 that since I did mathematical economics and there are all

129
00:07:46.461 --> 00:07:50.090
these finance people doing all kinds of mathematical things on Wall Street,
uh,

130
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.950
and doing it very successfully,
you know,

131
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:55.550
I thought I might just check out what they were doing so it might be fun to see

132
00:07:55.551 --> 00:08:00.150
what they were up to.
So I,
I went to,
uh,
to Wall Street and I joined.
Uh,

133
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.740
most people I knew,
fact professors I knew went to Goldman Sachs.

134
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:05.430
There was a famous,
uh,

135
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.570
finance professor who I mentioned before named Fisher Black,

136
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.930
who was there at the time and he attracted a lot of people.

137
00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:13.520
And so that was the traditional thing to do.

138
00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:18.230
But I decided to go to a little or firm called kidder Peabody.
And,
uh,

139
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.160
one thing,

140
00:08:19.161 --> 00:08:22.880
it was the seventh biggest investment bank at the time and one thing led to

141
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:23.830
another.
Um,

142
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:28.880
and they decided that they wanted to reorganize their research department in

143
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:29.750
Fixed Income.

144
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.840
And since I was a professor there and I did mathematical economics and I'm just

145
00:08:32.841 --> 00:08:34.280
there for the whole year.
Somebody said,

146
00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:36.680
the director of Fixed Income Department said,

147
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.450
why don't you take charge of it and hire a new fixed income research department

148
00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:44.150
for me.
So I did.

149
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:48.440
And ultimately there were 75 people in the department all the time.

150
00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:52.500
I was a professor at Yale and after five years,
um,

151
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.910
kidder Peabody even though was 135 years old,

152
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.880
formed by a famous family.

153
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.330
The name should sound Peabody familiar to you?
Um,

154
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:07.590
it closed down after 135 years,
five years after I got there,

155
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:11.880
I had to invite the 75 people I'd hired into my office and say,

156
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.193
you're fired.

157
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:17.310
And then I went next door to the office next to mine and the guy there said,

158
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.410
you're fired.
And so that was my first taste of Wall Street.

159
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.970
And after that,
um,
six of us founded a hedge fund called Ellington,

160
00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:30.720
capital management,
um,
which was a mortgage hedge fund.

161
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.810
And uh,
we had,
um,
I'll tell you a lot about,
uh,

162
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.470
about it.
It started after the kid are closing,
um,
uh,

163
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:44.670
as a rather small hedge fund.
But it grew into a very big mortgage hedge fun.

164
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:47.040
In fact,
the biggest mortgage hedge fund in the country,

165
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:50.520
although recently we found out that path practically everybody who trades

166
00:09:50.521 --> 00:09:53.340
mortgages is basically a hedge fund.
Fannie Mae,
Freddie Mac,

167
00:09:53.341 --> 00:09:54.480
they're all basically hedge funds.

168
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:57.360
So it doesn't mean anything anymore to say that you're a big mortgage hedge
fund.

169
00:09:57.361 --> 00:10:01.260
But anyway,
we almost went out of business in [inaudible] 98 a subject,

170
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:05.220
a story I'll tell you at great length and then we just suffered through this

171
00:10:05.221 --> 00:10:08.580
disastrous last year or two.
But we're still here.

172
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:13.910
So these experiences of course have colored my understanding of Wall Street and

173
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.290
my approach to the subject.
So I took on in my theoretical work,

174
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.050
finance and economic theory on its own terms.

175
00:10:22.051 --> 00:10:25.470
I didn't think like Schiller to introduce psychology and economics.

176
00:10:25.471 --> 00:10:28.770
I just take it on in its own terms,
on its own mathematical terms.

177
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:33.870
And what I found was that there are two things missing in the standard theory.

178
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:38.340
One is that it basic,
it implicitly assumes you can buy insurance for everything.

179
00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:42.480
That's the assumption that's called complete markets.
And secondly,

180
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.850
it leaves out collateral entirely.

181
00:10:44.851 --> 00:10:49.851
So you'll never see almost in any single economics textbook the idea of

182
00:10:49.981 --> 00:10:52.230
collateral or leverage.
And those,

183
00:10:52.231 --> 00:10:56.430
I think the idea that you can't get insurance for everything and that you need

184
00:10:56.431 --> 00:10:57.410
collateral,
you know,

185
00:10:57.411 --> 00:10:59.760
you have to be able to convince someone you're going to pay him back if you

186
00:10:59.761 --> 00:11:01.010
borrow money and collaterals.

187
00:11:01.011 --> 00:11:05.280
And most convincing way of persuading him he's going to be paid back the lender.

188
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.100
Those two things were missing from the standard theory.

189
00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:12.420
So I've built a theory around incomplete markets and leverage,

190
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:17.310
um,
uh,
which,
which is a critique of the standard theory.

191
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.040
So in a way,

192
00:11:20.041 --> 00:11:24.720
Schiller and I have been vindicated by the crash.

193
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.040
I mean,
uh,

194
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.830
so let me just show you a picture here.
Oh,

195
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:35.460
maybe I will.
Um,
you know how bad the crash was.

196
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:39.450
So let's look at the Dow Jones.

197
00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:46.410
Dow Jones.
Uh,
the Dow Jones is an average of 30 stocks and what their value is.

198
00:11:46.411 --> 00:11:48.660
We'll talk more about it later,
but here it is,

199
00:11:48.661 --> 00:11:53.661
back to 1913 moving along breezily going up and up and um,

200
00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:54.341
you know,

201
00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:59.341
there were a few blips which we'll come to later like this one.

202
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:05.290
Okay,
in 1929 and then,
but look what happened lately.
Look at that.

203
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:08.740
The Dow Jones was up at 14,000 and it drop until,
you know,

204
00:12:08.741 --> 00:12:10.930
6,500 something like that.

205
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.500
I'm more than a 50% drop and now it's gone 50% up again.

206
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.950
So if you believe these finance professors you'll have,

207
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:22.330
you'd have to say that everybody realized that future profits in America,

208
00:12:22.331 --> 00:12:25.840
we're going to be less than half what they thought they were going to be before.

209
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.300
And that's why the stock market dropped.

210
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:32.290
And then miraculously when it hit a bottom,
everybody figured,
oh my gosh,

211
00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:34.900
we misunderstood things.
Actually it's not nearly that bad.

212
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.530
And things are 50% higher because now that people think that profits really

213
00:12:38.531 --> 00:12:40.600
weren't going to go,
you know,
didn't drop in half.
They only,

214
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:44.740
it didn't drop by 50%.
They only dropped by 25%.
And that would be the only way,

215
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:47.200
according to the old theory,
to explain what happened.
Now,

216
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.850
fifth Shiller would just say,
well,
everybody's,
you know,
they're crazy.

217
00:12:51.851 --> 00:12:54.850
They got this into their head that the world is just going to be great.
And then,

218
00:12:54.851 --> 00:12:58.080
you know,
some rumors started and things were so high and people,
you know,

219
00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.060
the narrative change and they thought things were terrible.
And you know,

220
00:13:01.061 --> 00:13:03.580
that's his story and I'm not sure how he gets it to go up again.

221
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.870
They changed their mind again,
but okay.
So,
um,

222
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.840
all right.
Now by the way,
it's a little bit better to look at the,

223
00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:18.430
uh,
dow in,
in um,
sorry,

224
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.290
correcting for inflation and then you see that,
uh,
you know,

225
00:13:23.291 --> 00:13:27.280
the 1929 crash looks and this is on a log scale.

226
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.420
So the same abs,
you know,
remember before the depression,
you know,

227
00:13:31.421 --> 00:13:32.800
the stock market was so low,

228
00:13:32.801 --> 00:13:35.890
it's grown so much over 100 years that it hardly seem like anything was

229
00:13:35.891 --> 00:13:38.400
happening.
Well now in large scale,
uh,
you know,

230
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:42.560
going up two of these is multiplying by 10.
You see that the,

231
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.960
the in the Depression in 1929 through the early thirties,
the stock market fell.

232
00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:47.261
You know,

233
00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:50.100
I don't remember what it is and looks like it's almost two things is what I

234
00:13:50.101 --> 00:13:54.790
think it's 80 or 90% and uh,
the,
the fall this time has been,
you know,

235
00:13:54.791 --> 00:13:58.150
much smaller,
50%,
not 90%.

236
00:13:58.151 --> 00:14:02.560
So it's a whole thing down but not to,
not to things down.
Okay.

237
00:14:02.561 --> 00:14:06.250
So it's not a whole thing down.
It's less than that.

238
00:14:06.251 --> 00:14:09.850
If you know a whole thing down we the square root of 10 or a three,
you know,

239
00:14:09.851 --> 00:14:11.500
a third,
it didn't go down two thirds,

240
00:14:11.501 --> 00:14:13.840
it went down less than two thirds and went down 50%.

241
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:18.250
So the actual percentage drop was much worse in the depression than it is now.

242
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.220
Okay.
But now we're going to come,
come back to all these things.

243
00:14:21.221 --> 00:14:23.050
What else can we get out of these numbers?

244
00:14:23.051 --> 00:14:27.160
I just want you to notice a couple other things.
Suppose you look,

245
00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.190
so these numbers are all very interesting.
If your mathematical,

246
00:14:30.191 --> 00:14:32.530
these are sort of the sorts of things you pay attention to.

247
00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:37.270
So these efficient markets guys,
they looked at the change in price every month.

248
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:39.880
So there's a lot to say for their theory.
They said,
look,

249
00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.520
it goes up and down randomly.
In fact,

250
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:45.340
we'll see that there are all kinds of tests about whether you can predict it's

251
00:14:45.341 --> 00:14:48.100
going to go up tomorrow on the basis of how it would did yesterday.

252
00:14:48.101 --> 00:14:48.970
And the answer is no.

253
00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:53.000
It's very difficult to predict what the stock market's going up or down seems to

254
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:54.590
be random.
Well,

255
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.310
it's random and they used to think it was normally distributed.

256
00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.670
A lot of people argue is normally distributed,
but you know it's hard.

257
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.780
You never get these gigantic outliers.
If things are normally distributed,

258
00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:09.890
they're just way too unlikely to happen.
So Mandelbrot was,

259
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.860
who was a Yale professor who retired a couple of years ago,
all the way.

260
00:15:12.861 --> 00:15:15.470
It wasn't when he formed,
his theory is the inventor of fractals.

261
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:20.150
He said this couldn't possibly be a random walk in the traditional Brownian

262
00:15:20.151 --> 00:15:23.120
motion sense of the word,
because you'd never get these big outliers.

263
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:27.980
But he offered no explanation for why they might be there.
And you know,

264
00:15:27.981 --> 00:15:29.810
I don't know,
Schiller has an explanation either.
I mean,

265
00:15:29.811 --> 00:15:32.510
isn't that people suddenly get shocked one day and then the next week they

266
00:15:32.511 --> 00:15:35.430
changed their mind and things aren't so bad after all.
Um,

267
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:40.040
but you'll see that the theory of collateral and margins does explain these

268
00:15:40.041 --> 00:15:44.810
kinds of things.
Okay.
Now let's just look at the Dow.

269
00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:48.230
Uh,
not that we just looked at the Dow.
Let's look at another,

270
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:53.540
the s and p 500.
Okay,
so,

271
00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:56.130
<v 1>Ooh,
um,</v>

272
00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.730
<v 0>where's the s and p 500,</v>

273
00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:09.903
<v 1>sorry.</v>

274
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:15.590
<v 0>Okay,
here we go.
Here's the s and p 500 data.
Okay,
so here's the history,</v>

275
00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:19.080
the s and p 500.
It looks very similar to the d to the dao,
and now,

276
00:16:19.081 --> 00:16:22.410
except we have longer history back to 1871.

277
00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.950
So I just want to point out one more thing.
In the s and p 500.

278
00:16:25.951 --> 00:16:30.900
So this is an average of 500 stocks,
not just 30,
but it's more or less the same.

279
00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.450
But let's look at the same thing.

280
00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:38.040
Taking the log rhythm and check for a inflation.

281
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:42.000
Okay.
So you see here that that,
you know,

282
00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:45.990
there are these four cycles,
things seem low in 1871,

283
00:16:45.991 --> 00:16:47.160
they go up and they go down.

284
00:16:47.161 --> 00:16:49.750
Then you've got another up and a down and then you've got another up and,

285
00:16:49.751 --> 00:16:53.130
and down.
You've got another up and down.
Four times the same thing has happened.

286
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:57.990
Now this could be just meaningless accidents,
but it will turn out that,

287
00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.280
um,
the demography of the country,

288
00:17:02.281 --> 00:17:06.570
the baby boom cycle,
we haven't had just one baby boom we've had for them.

289
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.950
So this cycle of stock prices happens to court,
you know,
which is there.

290
00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:14.370
Each time a generation long happens to correspond exactly to the rise,

291
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.490
the different age distribution of the population.

292
00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.650
So another theory of the stock market,

293
00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.670
which wouldn't have been entertained by these,
uh,
original,
uh,

294
00:17:23.671 --> 00:17:28.110
financial theorists is that demography has something to do with the stock
market.

295
00:17:28.111 --> 00:17:30.000
Not Information about profits and returns,

296
00:17:30.001 --> 00:17:32.190
but the distribution of ages in the population.

297
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.280
So I'm not saying this theory is correct,

298
00:17:35.281 --> 00:17:39.990
although I was one of the proponents of it,
but it,
it leaves,

299
00:17:39.991 --> 00:17:41.610
it shows that there's room,

300
00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:46.800
I think in economics and finance for economic things,

301
00:17:46.801 --> 00:17:50.640
for demography to matter,
for leverage to matter,

302
00:17:50.641 --> 00:17:55.470
and not just for expectations about future profits.
So let's,

303
00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:56.880
let me show you another picture.

304
00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:01.530
So this is a second way in which Schiller became famous.
He said,

305
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:06.630
well,
look at housing prices,
the case Shiller housing index.

306
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:10.380
So he's also famous because he had the idea of collecting housing prices.
So,

307
00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:15.270
you know,
it's quite amazing.
Every town has to record,
you know,

308
00:18:15.271 --> 00:18:20.100
it's it by law you have to record in the town directory and they're often on the

309
00:18:20.101 --> 00:18:22.980
internet what the price is of every sale of every house.

310
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.880
So everybody has it and it's all publicly available on the Internet and are,

311
00:18:26.881 --> 00:18:28.800
most of it is publicly available on the Internet.

312
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.970
And nobody thought to gather all this information together and take the average

313
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:37.530
and write down an index.
Okay.
Until Schiller did it.
So here's the Shiller index,

314
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:40.020
um,
which is all right.

315
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.440
So you can see that housing prices were pretty stable,
you know,

316
00:18:43.441 --> 00:18:47.580
throughout the 80s.
And then in around 2000 they started taking off.

317
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.850
So this is when the stock market was taking off too.
So she'll says,

318
00:18:50.851 --> 00:18:53.400
this is irrational exuberance.
People just went crazy.

319
00:18:53.401 --> 00:18:56.310
They somehow think things can never go down and they're just gonna keep going up

320
00:18:56.311 --> 00:18:59.790
and they keep buying because I think things are going to go up and it's a crazy

321
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:03.630
and things are going to,
you know,
psychology.
Eventually people are going to,

322
00:19:03.631 --> 00:19:05.850
a new narrative is going to start.
Somebody is gonna say,
Oh,

323
00:19:05.851 --> 00:19:08.940
they've been going up so long,
they can continue to go up.
Things have to go down.

324
00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.610
Okay.
And things went down.
Now

325
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.480
I think there's something to psychology.

326
00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.990
So there was something missing in the original finance story.
Uh,

327
00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:23.010
the finance guys,
by the way,
they would say,
well,
the rise is not so surprising.

328
00:19:23.011 --> 00:19:24.360
Look at the mortgage rates.

329
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.610
This is the interest rate you have to pay if you get a mortgage.

330
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.930
There's been an incredible decline in mortgage rates over the years.

331
00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:35.010
So it's easier.
It's less costly to buy a housing.

332
00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:38.850
If you take the present value of your expenditures on buying the house.
You know,

333
00:19:38.851 --> 00:19:42.390
you just have to pay less.
So that's why the the,
you know,
uh,

334
00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:46.050
you know that you pay over a long period of time.

335
00:19:46.051 --> 00:19:48.370
And so the interest rate is less than.
So the,
the,

336
00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:51.240
the value of the houses is worth more because you're discounting the future

337
00:19:51.241 --> 00:19:53.850
benefits at a lower rate.
You'll hear all about discounting later.

338
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.490
So there's no mystery.
On the other hand,
they don't have anything.

339
00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:00.030
Nothing happened to interest rates.
They kept getting lawyer lower.

340
00:20:00.031 --> 00:20:02.880
So there's no reason why the market should have crashed.
So again,

341
00:20:02.881 --> 00:20:04.890
this seems like indication for Schiller.

342
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:10.260
Now it also in ways of indication for,
for my theory,

343
00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.700
which is non psychological.
So I,
I,

344
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.350
I'm distrustful a little bit of a psychology cause it can be anything.

345
00:20:16.351 --> 00:20:20.550
Although I agree it's important.
So my theory is it's when you,

346
00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.490
when you take a loan,
you have to negotiate two things.

347
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.370
The interest rate and how much collateral you put up,

348
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.400
who's going to trust you to pay back when you buy a house.

349
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:32.820
They say you can't just borrow the whole value of the house.
They say,

350
00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:37.770
well make a down payment of 20% borrow 80% of the value of the house.
Okay.

351
00:20:37.771 --> 00:20:41.550
And so what I say is that instead of paying all your attention to the interest

352
00:20:41.551 --> 00:20:45.960
rate,
think about the collateral rate.
Why is it 20% that you have to put down?

353
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:50.800
Maybe it should be 10% or 40% well in fact that number changes all the time.

354
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:55.600
So here what I've done is the pink line from 2000 to the future.

355
00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:00.160
That pink line is Schiller's housing index in Verdun.

356
00:21:00.161 --> 00:21:03.880
So you notice the scale on the right is the housing prices,
but I've inverted it.

357
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.960
Okay.
And on the left I have the down payment percentage.

358
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:13.390
So it starts at 14 these are not,
not for,

359
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.030
these are non agency loans.
So I'm not going to explain the,

360
00:21:16.031 --> 00:21:17.110
we'll come back to the graph later.

361
00:21:17.111 --> 00:21:18.910
I don't have time to explain exactly how I got it.

362
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.670
Then what you see is that from 2000 onwards,

363
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.920
the down payment people were asked to make,

364
00:21:23.921 --> 00:21:27.400
to buy their house got lower and lower and lower and lower,

365
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.520
and it got down to 3% you could put down 3% of the value of the House and borrow

366
00:21:33.131 --> 00:21:36.700
the other 97% of the value of the house to buy it.

367
00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:41.920
So amazingly,
the prices go down just with what's called the leverage.

368
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:43.990
So why is it called leverage?

369
00:21:43.991 --> 00:21:48.400
Because the amount of the cash you put down payments say 10% you can lever it up

370
00:21:48.401 --> 00:21:51.370
and own an asset that's worth a hundred even when you put down $10 to your

371
00:21:51.371 --> 00:21:54.700
leverage,
10 to one if you put down $3 you can leverage it.

372
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:59.440
And he had $100 House you've leveraged at 30 to 133 to one so that's why it's

373
00:21:59.441 --> 00:22:03.400
called leverage.
So anyway,
the point is that leverage went way up.

374
00:22:03.401 --> 00:22:05.380
The margins kept going down and down and down,

375
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:09.100
and just at the peak of the housing cycle,
which is the bottom of that curve,

376
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.360
that's when
collateral started getting tougher.

377
00:22:13.361 --> 00:22:16.330
And people started asking for more money down again.
And sure enough,

378
00:22:16.331 --> 00:22:21.100
the price has turned around.
So if you look at the prices of mortgages,

379
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:25.540
again,
the inverse on the right,
and you look at the,
the margins on the left,

380
00:22:25.541 --> 00:22:27.970
not for buying houses,
but for buying securities.

381
00:22:27.971 --> 00:22:29.680
I don't have time to explain this whole graph,

382
00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:34.570
but the blue line is the buying securities.
So 98 is a big crisis.

383
00:22:34.571 --> 00:22:38.050
The margin spike up.
I don't have pricing data back till van.

384
00:22:38.051 --> 00:22:38.890
That's the Blue Line.

385
00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:43.330
And now from 2007 to 2009 you see the margin spiking up.

386
00:22:43.331 --> 00:22:46.240
So to buy a toxic mortgage security,

387
00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:51.400
you people who investors don't pay cash,
they borrow part of the money to buy it.

388
00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:54.550
They used to put down only 5% to buy it.

389
00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:58.600
Now they have to put down 70% to buy it on average.
Well,

390
00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.140
what happened to prices?
Prices.
This is the inverse of prices.

391
00:23:02.141 --> 00:23:05.110
In 2007 they started to collapse.
Okay,

392
00:23:05.111 --> 00:23:08.580
so this going up means prices are collapsing.
So once again,
the margins,

393
00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:13.390
tougher margins means lower prices.
And as the margins came down recently,

394
00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:17.260
the prices have gone up recently.
So it's an alternative theory.

395
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.960
So,
um,
all right,
so what,

396
00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:24.550
what,
uh,

397
00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:30.830
all right.
So what,
what else do I want to show you?

398
00:23:30.831 --> 00:23:35.690
So it doesn't mean that the standard financial theory is wrong.

399
00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.390
After all,
I help run a hedge fund,

400
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:41.660
six of US founded it and we've been in business for 15 years.

401
00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.720
We must believe in standard financial theory because that's how we've been

402
00:23:44.721 --> 00:23:48.440
making a lot of our money and we exploit all those algorithms.

403
00:23:48.441 --> 00:23:49.820
And those are the things I'm going to teach you.

404
00:23:49.821 --> 00:23:53.930
So I certainly believe it and it's very important,
uh,
uh,

405
00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:57.440
to teach you that again today.
But there's more,
that's the semester,

406
00:23:57.441 --> 00:24:02.150
but there's more to the theory.
Um,
then just that,
so let me show you the doubt.

407
00:24:02.151 --> 00:24:05.990
I want to show you one more thing in the,
in the Dow Jones or the s and P,

408
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.790
which I forgot to mention.
And where is this?

409
00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:15.500
Oh,
I can't get it out of that.
Let's try down.
Okay.

410
00:24:15.501 --> 00:24:19.100
So Dao,
hey,
where was the,

411
00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.580
where was the peak of the Dao was right over here.
Now what was the date?

412
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:27.950
The dates falls to flash here.
Okay,
so it's October 1st,
2007.

413
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:30.740
Okay,
now let's just,

414
00:24:30.741 --> 00:24:34.040
so that's when people started to realize something was wrong with the world and

415
00:24:34.041 --> 00:24:37.460
things headed down.
Okay,
now why is this blood?

416
00:24:37.461 --> 00:24:41.420
If you look at until then,
nothing bad seems to be happening in the world.

417
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:45.950
But suppose that you looked not at,
um,
the Dao.

418
00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.740
Suppose you looked,
sorry.

419
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.350
Okay,
here's a graph.
Suppose you look.

420
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:59.900
Suppose you looked at the sub prime mortgage index.
So you see it's a hundred.

421
00:24:59.901 --> 00:25:01.550
You'll understand what these things are.

422
00:25:01.551 --> 00:25:04.880
So a hundred means nobody thinks there's going to be a default over here.

423
00:25:04.881 --> 00:25:06.530
January,
2007,

424
00:25:06.531 --> 00:25:10.880
that's 10 months before the stock market starts to go down before it hits its

425
00:25:10.881 --> 00:25:15.170
peak.
The stock market is still going up here.
A month later,
this is April,
2007.

426
00:25:15.171 --> 00:25:18.470
A month later,
the sub prime index starts to collapse.
You see,

427
00:25:18.471 --> 00:25:19.910
it goes from a hundred to 60.

428
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:23.870
We're already in in in February or March,
2007.

429
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.730
So that means the people,

430
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:30.620
those experts trading mortgages already realized there was a calamity about to

431
00:25:30.621 --> 00:25:31.370
happen.

432
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:35.420
This was long before anyone else perceived anything happening long before the

433
00:25:35.421 --> 00:25:36.530
stock market mood,

434
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.710
long before the government doing anything to correct the problem.

435
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:44.600
So just as financial theory says,
if you pay attention to the prices,

436
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.480
you can learn a lot about the world,
the people trading those things,

437
00:25:47.481 --> 00:25:49.730
their life depends on fixing the right prices.

438
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:51.560
Probably they know stuff that you don't know.

439
00:25:51.561 --> 00:25:54.860
The prices are going to reflect their opinion if the price collapsed.

440
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:57.630
Part of the reason that collapsed,
maybe margins and something,

441
00:25:57.631 --> 00:25:58.490
he had something to do with it.

442
00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:02.690
But part of the reason that collapsed was because they knew something bad was

443
00:26:02.691 --> 00:26:04.790
happening.
So for two and a half years,

444
00:26:04.791 --> 00:26:08.240
we've known there's going to be a major catastrophe in the mortgage market.

445
00:26:08.241 --> 00:26:10.730
You know,
a little from a hundred to 60,

446
00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:15.500
since the 20 is a total calamity.
So you know that there are,

447
00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:20.060
uh,
there,
there's 1.7 million people for already been thrown out of their houses.

448
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:24.230
Another three and a half million aren't paying their debts and uh,
you know,

449
00:26:24.231 --> 00:26:25.520
are seriously delinquent,

450
00:26:25.521 --> 00:26:29.000
probably all of them will be thrown out of their houses and another four or 5

451
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.820
million after them might default and have to be thrown out of their houses.

452
00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:33.350
So it's a major catastrophe.

453
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:37.160
And the market told us and warned us about it two and a half years ago and

454
00:26:37.161 --> 00:26:41.150
nobody's been done anything about it basically until now as we'll find out.

455
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.590
So it's not that I think financial theory,

456
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.370
the standard financial theory is wrong.
I think it's incredibly useful.

457
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:51.660
I just think it has to be supplemented by a more general and Richard Theory.

458
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.710
So,
um,
by the way,
just to,

459
00:26:56.190 --> 00:27:00.150
maybe I should show you how my hedge fund has done just so that you don't think,

460
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:04.770
you don't think that it was a total failure.
Um,
so,

461
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:08.420
uh,
oh dear.

462
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:13.380
Where is my returns?
Here we go.

463
00:27:13.381 --> 00:27:17.880
Emg Returns and sort of interesting.
So we started in 19.

464
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:21.870
So the QRP body went out of business in 1994.

465
00:27:21.871 --> 00:27:25.230
There was a tremendous crash in the market.
A Lo of the levered cycle.

466
00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.750
The purple is Ellington.
That's the hedge fun.
Uh,

467
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:31.650
you'll see that these are other investment opportunities.

468
00:27:31.651 --> 00:27:34.020
The S and p 500 is the green thing,

469
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.060
which looked like it was doing great for a while.
Um,

470
00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:42.170
emerging markets is the blue one and high yield is the green one.

471
00:27:43.531 --> 00:27:46.950
And then there are a bunch of other things like treasuries and this is live war

472
00:27:46.951 --> 00:27:50.790
and which is the,
what banks lend to each other at.
So this says,

473
00:27:50.791 --> 00:27:53.430
if you put your money into any of those strategies,
you know,

474
00:27:53.431 --> 00:27:55.310
in live where keep buying the,
you know,

475
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:59.430
lending your money each month to a bank and seeing what interests you get and

476
00:27:59.431 --> 00:28:02.940
seeing how much money you accumulate or putting your money in Ellington and

477
00:28:02.941 --> 00:28:06.630
looking at the purple or putting your dollars into the stock market and see what

478
00:28:06.631 --> 00:28:09.660
happens.
The S and p 500,
this is what happens.

479
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.370
So you see there was a crash here.
You know,
you're fired,

480
00:28:14.371 --> 00:28:18.930
you're fired.
So we start Ellington and pro,
you know,
Ellington does great.

481
00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:23.220
And so we have all these years,
we're doing brain than 98.
There's another crash.

482
00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:26.880
Look what happened overnight.
Practically,
we lost a huge amount of money.

483
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.760
We almost went out of business longterm capital,

484
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:33.510
which by the way was run partly by two Nobel prize winners.
Merton Miller,

485
00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:37.440
not Merton Miller,
uh,
Myron shoals and,
uh,
Robert Merton,

486
00:28:37.441 --> 00:28:41.130
two of the guys I mentioned with the leaders of the financial crisis,

487
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:44.400
they bankrupted their company and they went out of business.

488
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:45.840
And why did they go out of business?

489
00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:49.410
Because they weren't aware of the leverage cycle in my view.
Anyway,
so the,

490
00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:53.100
so the prices collapsed then look at all these returns,

491
00:28:53.101 --> 00:28:57.480
shoot up again and uh,
in the world seems to be doing great.
The stock market,

492
00:28:57.481 --> 00:29:00.960
everybody is doing great.
Then there's another crisis in 2007,

493
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:02.820
everything plummets.
Okay?

494
00:29:02.821 --> 00:29:07.080
All together this time and then everything's going up again.
So,

495
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.830
you know,
it's hard to see this and to live through that.

496
00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:15.750
So I remember in 98,
for example,
when there was a margin call,

497
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.600
our lenders called and said,
we want more money.

498
00:29:18.601 --> 00:29:21.240
We don't believe that the assets are worth as much as they were,

499
00:29:21.241 --> 00:29:24.270
and so the collateral is not covering alone anymore.
And we said,

500
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.490
you can't make a margin call.
It's not legal.

501
00:29:26.491 --> 00:29:29.670
You've promised not to change the margins on it for six months.

502
00:29:29.671 --> 00:29:31.950
You can't make a margin call.
And they say,
well,
blah,
blah,
blah.

503
00:29:31.951 --> 00:29:34.800
We don't really know about that.
We're making a margin call.

504
00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:38.370
So we called up Warren Buffet and we said,
this is terrible.

505
00:29:38.371 --> 00:29:40.740
They're making a margin call.
They can't do this.
We have great bonds.

506
00:29:40.741 --> 00:29:42.220
There's nothing wrong with the bonds.
There's just,
you know,

507
00:29:42.221 --> 00:29:45.790
they're going to force us to sell all the bonds to pay them the money and how

508
00:29:45.791 --> 00:29:47.560
can they force us to do that they shouldn't force us to do,

509
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.020
and we've got great bonds.
It's a great business.
It's a great company,

510
00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:51.910
and they're going to run us out of bed z.
You can't let this happen.

511
00:29:51.911 --> 00:29:52.401
Warren Buffet,

512
00:29:52.401 --> 00:29:54.940
why don't you buy part of the company and save us and you'll get rich and it'll

513
00:29:54.941 --> 00:29:57.460
be great.
He said,
say that again.
And we said,
well,

514
00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:04.630
they're going to force us to sell all the bonds on Ma,
you know,
on Tuesday to,

515
00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:05.051
you know,

516
00:30:05.051 --> 00:30:08.440
to meet their margin call and we'll get terrible prices for the bonds will be

517
00:30:08.441 --> 00:30:10.270
driven out of business even though they're great bonds,

518
00:30:10.271 --> 00:30:11.710
just because they're making a margin call.

519
00:30:11.711 --> 00:30:15.220
You can't let this happen to us by part of the business and save us and you'll

520
00:30:15.221 --> 00:30:18.730
get rich alone part of a great company.
And he said,
hell,

521
00:30:18.731 --> 00:30:22.180
it sounds like I should just show up on Tuesday and buy the bonds so that,

522
00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:25.750
so we survived that.
We survived the,

523
00:30:25.751 --> 00:30:28.240
I'll tell you more about what we did and we survived that.

524
00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:30.400
No thanks to Warren Buffett.
And then

525
00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:36.640
although he had a pretty good idea and then we,
uh,
then we,
uh,

526
00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:39.490
survived the last crash.
So we survived all these crashes.

527
00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:44.170
But the fact is things go up,
they crashed,
they go up,
they crash,
they go up.

528
00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:47.680
Could it all be my fault?
I decided they can't be all my fault.

529
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:50.260
It's gotta be there.
Something more basic at work.

530
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:53.440
And that's why I'm going to tell you about the leverage cycle.
Now,

531
00:30:53.441 --> 00:30:58.120
of course I realize that,
you know,
my pet theories may not turn out to be right,

532
00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:02.050
although I think more and more people are starting to think there's something to

533
00:31:02.051 --> 00:31:04.140
it.
So I'm not going to spend,
you know,

534
00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:08.140
a huge portion of the course just talking about my pet theories.

535
00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:13.120
I mean I recognize that,
um,
you know,

536
00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.240
I have to teach partly what standards,
so what I'm going,

537
00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:20.740
so the course is going to be divided in the following way.
I'm going to spend,
uh,

538
00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:25.690
I'm going to talk about the standard nobody arbitrage financial theory and I'm

539
00:31:25.691 --> 00:31:28.690
going to talk about it theoretically and mathematically and from a practical

540
00:31:28.691 --> 00:31:32.740
point of view,
you know,
because how helping to run the hedge fund,
um,
you know,

541
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:35.410
lots of,
lots of the things that I'll be teaching her,

542
00:31:35.411 --> 00:31:37.960
things that we actually confront and the hedge fund.
And so you'll,

543
00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.950
you'll get the standard financial theory course taught from a hedge fund

544
00:31:41.951 --> 00:31:44.680
perspective,
both theoretically and from a practical point of view.

545
00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.340
On the other hand,
I've lived now through three mortgage crises.

546
00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:52.900
And so it seems silly for me not to describe how the mortgage market works,

547
00:31:52.901 --> 00:31:56.260
even when you'll find almost none of that in any standard finance textbook,

548
00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:59.410
how the mortgage market works and uh,
you know,

549
00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:03.640
what's going on and what happened in the crises and how we survived and how

550
00:32:03.641 --> 00:32:06.370
other people didn't.
And I'll talk about the leverage cycle.

551
00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:08.380
I'll also spend some time,

552
00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:13.060
I think it's quite important on the mathematical logic of the invisible hand

553
00:32:13.061 --> 00:32:16.180
argument.
That's the most important argument in economics.
You know,

554
00:32:16.181 --> 00:32:21.181
that the free market does good for the economy and a huge number of people

555
00:32:21.461 --> 00:32:24.500
believe it.
And,
and part of that argument and part of the,

556
00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:29.550
the sort of hazy knowledge of that argument is what drives resistance to a lot

557
00:32:29.591 --> 00:32:30.820
of government programs.

558
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.020
I mean the government can only screw things up is what people generally believe.

559
00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:39.170
And is it a prejudice or is there some actual argument behind that?
Well,

560
00:32:39.171 --> 00:32:43.910
I want to go over that argument and show you precisely how it works and how it

561
00:32:43.911 --> 00:32:47.060
doesn't work and in the financial sphere.

562
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:51.920
And then I want to talk about social security.
That's one more program.

563
00:32:51.921 --> 00:32:56.330
That's the biggest program in the budget.
It's as big as defense,

564
00:32:56.331 --> 00:32:58.940
which then the two of those are much bigger than everything else.

565
00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:01.700
A vastly bigger than every other thing and the budget.

566
00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:04.580
So I want to talk about social security and you know,

567
00:33:04.581 --> 00:33:07.850
should it be privatized and should it be reformed and why did it go bankrupt?

568
00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:12.110
It's also an interesting mathematical problem because social security critically

569
00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:16.940
involves the belief that things will go on forever.
So there's an infinity in it,

570
00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.330
you know,
each generation,
the young are paying for the old.

571
00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:23.510
Nobody would do that if they thought they were going to be the last generation

572
00:33:23.511 --> 00:33:25.910
paying to the old and when they got old and nobody would help them.

573
00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:30.260
So a social security rests on this world going on forever,

574
00:33:30.261 --> 00:33:33.290
which makes it mathematically interesting.
And anyway,

575
00:33:33.291 --> 00:33:36.320
so I got interested in it from a theorist,
radical point of view.

576
00:33:36.321 --> 00:33:40.430
And then I got put in all these national academy panels and Social Security and

577
00:33:40.431 --> 00:33:44.180
privatizing.
And so I,
I know quite a bit about it,

578
00:33:44.181 --> 00:33:46.310
so I might as well talk about something I know about.

579
00:33:46.311 --> 00:33:48.470
So that's what I'm talking about.
That.
All right.

580
00:33:48.471 --> 00:33:52.070
So this is too hard for you to read.
So let's do this.

581
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:56.230
So let me just give you a few examples.
Oops.
Oh,

582
00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.590
I hope I didn't do a terrible thing.
No.
Okay.

583
00:34:00.591 --> 00:34:04.070
So let me just give you a few examples here of the kinds of,

584
00:34:04.071 --> 00:34:07.280
just so you think there's,
you realize there's something to the standard theory,

585
00:34:07.281 --> 00:34:08.180
there's a lot to it.

586
00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:12.050
So I'll give you 10 examples very quickly of the standard theory.

587
00:34:12.410 --> 00:34:17.360
So these are things that I'm guessing you'll have at least some of them trouble

588
00:34:17.361 --> 00:34:18.800
figuring out how to answer now,

589
00:34:18.801 --> 00:34:23.570
but by the end of the course is they should be totally obvious to you.
So,
um,

590
00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:28.940
suppose you win the lottery,
$40 million or $100 million.

591
00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:30.950
The lottery now,
they always give you the choice.

592
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.170
Do you want to take 5 million a year,

593
00:34:33.171 --> 00:34:38.000
over 20 years or just get $40 million right now?
Which would you do?

594
00:34:38.001 --> 00:34:41.810
And how do you think about what to do?
Okay,
that one.
Okay,

595
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.320
so now you get tenure at Yale at the age of 50.

596
00:34:45.321 --> 00:34:50.321
Say you're making $150,000 a year and you think you know professors and she's

597
00:34:51.081 --> 00:34:54.740
going to go up with the rate of inflation and that's about it for the next 20

598
00:34:54.741 --> 00:34:57.830
years to your retire and then so that's 20 years of that,

599
00:34:57.831 --> 00:35:00.260
and then you're going to live another 20 years when you're going to be making

600
00:35:00.261 --> 00:35:03.500
nothing.
Okay?
So how much of the 150,000 this,

601
00:35:03.501 --> 00:35:08.501
and let's say inflation is 3% and what you'd like to do is consume inflation,

602
00:35:08.571 --> 00:35:13.190
corrected the same amount every year after you retire and before you retire.

603
00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:16.760
So how much of the 150,000 should you spend this year and how much should you

604
00:35:16.761 --> 00:35:21.170
save?
Okay,
that's another,
you learn very quickly how to do a problem like that.

605
00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:26.420
Okay?
Now,
President Levin wrote a few months ago,
the end of last year,

606
00:35:26.421 --> 00:35:31.400
if you remember,
he said that,
well,
the crisis was bad.
You know,
Yale was going to,

607
00:35:31.401 --> 00:35:35.420
whether it,
but Yale did lost 25% probably of its endowment.

608
00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:38.940
That's $5 billion almost of the $23 billion endowment.

609
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.720
So how much should he choose to cut his decision?

610
00:35:42.721 --> 00:35:47.130
How much should Yale reduce spending every year spending?

611
00:35:47.131 --> 00:35:49.800
The total spending a year is a little over 2 billion.

612
00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:53.790
So the endowment goes down by 5 billion.
What cuts did you take to the budget?

613
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:58.880
Should faculty salaries be cut,
be frozen?
Should,
uh,
you know,
the TA's,

614
00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:02.220
you know,
should you have three tas instead of four tas?
Should you,

615
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.010
what should you do?
How big a cut should you take?
Now,

616
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:09.150
the same question faced Yale in 1996 or so,

617
00:36:09.151 --> 00:36:11.520
I forgotten exactly the year,
10 or 12 years ago,

618
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:13.470
the previous President Benno Schmidt,

619
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:17.670
he suddenly noticed that there was deferred maintenance as he called it,

620
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:21.870
$1 billion to fix the Yale buildings.
That's why incidentally,

621
00:36:21.871 --> 00:36:23.610
every year another college gets fixed.

622
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.460
They decided there was deferred maintenance of $1 billion.

623
00:36:26.461 --> 00:36:30.660
It had $100 million every year for 10 years had to be spent.
Uh,

624
00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:32.640
the whole endowment then was 3 billion,

625
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:36.150
and now we had a $1 billion deferred maintenance problem.

626
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.370
The budget was about 1 billion.
Then.

627
00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:43.680
So how much should you cut the Yale budget?
At that time.
So bound Schmidt's said,

628
00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:45.810
I'm firing 15% of the faculty.

629
00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:49.770
You announced he was firing 15% of the faculty that was in the front pages of

630
00:36:49.771 --> 00:36:54.540
the New York Times yell to fire faculty.
Well,
did,

631
00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:55.980
did he make the right decision?

632
00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:02.070
Rick 11 took over his presidents three months later.
So probably not,

633
00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:06.870
but
what mistake did he make in his calculations?

634
00:37:06.871 --> 00:37:09.720
What should he have done?
What was the right response?
Okay,

635
00:37:09.721 --> 00:37:12.520
so we're going to talk about,
okay,
so that's something you should be able to,

636
00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:17.220
so it's not that hard a problem.
Um,
now let's take a,

637
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:22.050
let's take a slightly more complicated one.
You're a bookie,
uh,

638
00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:26.490
and you're,
the world series is coming up.
The Yankees are playing the Dodgers,

639
00:37:26.491 --> 00:37:27.270
let's say,

640
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:31.140
and you know that the teams are evenly matched and you've got a bunch of friends

641
00:37:31.141 --> 00:37:31.831
who,
you know,

642
00:37:31.831 --> 00:37:36.150
every game we'll be willing to bet and even odds on either side because they're,

643
00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:39.600
you know,
they think it's the,
that's a toss up.

644
00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:43.740
One of your customers comes to you and says,
he's a Yankee Fan.

645
00:37:43.741 --> 00:37:45.180
He's sure the Yankees are gonna win.

646
00:37:45.181 --> 00:37:48.540
He's willing to put up $300,000 to bet on the Yankees,

647
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.060
which he loses it.
So if the Yankees,

648
00:37:51.061 --> 00:37:55.410
when he gets 200,000 but at the Yankees lose,
he loses 300,000.

649
00:37:55.411 --> 00:37:59.640
So three to two odds,
he's willing to bet on the Yankees winning what you say,

650
00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:02.550
this guy is sort of a soccer here.
I can take a big advantage of them.

651
00:38:02.551 --> 00:38:07.200
On the other hand,
the guys,
it's a lot of money.
200,000 I might lose,
you know,

652
00:38:07.201 --> 00:38:11.940
if I,
uh,
if I have to pay off in the Yankees win.
So even though I think that,
uh,

653
00:38:11.941 --> 00:38:13.610
you know,
the odds are in my,
you know,
I,

654
00:38:13.611 --> 00:38:17.850
my expected profit as positive because he's putting up 300,000 to make only 200

655
00:38:17.851 --> 00:38:22.230
when they're even odds.
In fact,
the fact is it's such a big number.
I don't,

656
00:38:22.231 --> 00:38:26.370
you know,
I'm a little worried about that.
So what do you do?
So what can you do?

657
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:30.930
You've got these friends who were willing to bet it even odds each game by game.

658
00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:33.570
So how much money,

659
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:37.540
presumably the first night you're going to bet with one of your friends or you

660
00:38:37.541 --> 00:38:39.540
take the guy's bad,
the customer,
you,

661
00:38:39.541 --> 00:38:44.080
you take us 300,000 you promised to deliver in 500 back if the Yankees win and

662
00:38:44.081 --> 00:38:47.770
to keep it,
if the Yankees lose,
what should you do with your friends?

663
00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:49.930
Should you bet on the Yankees with your friends?

664
00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:53.500
Should you bout on the Dodgers with your friends and how much should you bet at

665
00:38:53.501 --> 00:38:57.790
even odds the first night?
Okay,
so that doesn't,
so the answer is,
well,

666
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:59.590
I don't want to give all the answers now,

667
00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:04.480
but so there is a way of skillfully bedding with your friends and not betting

668
00:39:04.481 --> 00:39:07.960
200 or 300,000 the first night with your friends and even odds,

669
00:39:07.961 --> 00:39:09.400
you bet some different number than that,

670
00:39:09.401 --> 00:39:12.670
which you'll figure out how much to bet so that if you keep betting through the

671
00:39:12.671 --> 00:39:15.790
course of the world series,
you can never lose a penny.
Okay?

672
00:39:15.791 --> 00:39:17.470
But how do you know how much that is?
Well,

673
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.940
that's the kind of clever thing that you're going to,
you know,

674
00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:23.140
these finance guys developed and you're going to know how to do.

675
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:27.550
So let's do another example like that one thing at a time,
a little bit,

676
00:39:27.551 --> 00:39:32.110
but one an example.
Suppose as a deck of cards,
26 red in 26 black cards,

677
00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:34.150
somebody offers to play a game with you.

678
00:39:34.151 --> 00:39:37.630
They say every time if you want to pick a card and it's black,

679
00:39:37.631 --> 00:39:41.860
I'll give you a dollar.
If it's red,
you give me a dollar.
So if I'm picking,

680
00:39:41.861 --> 00:39:45.640
I get a dot.
I'm in the black,
I get a dollar,
it's in the red,
I lose a dollar.

681
00:39:45.641 --> 00:39:49.120
I have to throw away the card after I pick it.
And the guy says,
by the way,

682
00:39:49.121 --> 00:39:52.420
you can quit whenever you want.
All right,

683
00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:54.730
so should you pick the first card?

684
00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:58.330
Looks like an even chance of winning or losing.

685
00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:03.400
But say you pick the first card,
it's black,
you win a dollar.
Now the guy says,

686
00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:07.570
do you want to do it again?
The deck is 26 you picked a black one.

687
00:40:07.571 --> 00:40:10.300
So there's 26 red left and 25 black.

688
00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:15.520
So it's now the deck is stacked against you.
Should you pick another card?
Well,

689
00:40:15.521 --> 00:40:17.350
it doesn't sound like you should pick another card,

690
00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.690
but you shouldn't pick another card.

691
00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:22.930
And I can even tell you how many cards to pick,

692
00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.510
even if you keep getting blacks who should keep picking and picking.

693
00:40:25.511 --> 00:40:27.970
So how could that be?
It sounds kind of shocking.
Well,

694
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.060
it's going to turn out to be very simple for you to solve,
uh,

695
00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:35.560
halfway through the course.
So let suppo let's,
uh,
let's a more basic question.

696
00:40:35.561 --> 00:40:37.120
Let's suppose that you,
you know,

697
00:40:37.121 --> 00:40:40.510
they're 30 year mortgages now you can get for five and three quarter percent

698
00:40:40.511 --> 00:40:43.720
interest.
They're 15 year mortgages.
You can get for less,

699
00:40:43.721 --> 00:40:46.390
like 5.3% interest.

700
00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:48.910
I'm one's lower than the other.

701
00:40:48.911 --> 00:40:51.430
Should you take the 15 year mortgage with a 30 year mortgage?

702
00:40:51.431 --> 00:40:52.570
How do you even think about that?

703
00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:56.200
Why do they offer one at a lower price than the other?
Um,

704
00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:58.510
okay.
And one more example.

705
00:40:58.511 --> 00:41:01.900
Suppose you're a bank and you hold a bunch of mortgages.

706
00:41:01.901 --> 00:41:04.870
That means the people in the houses of,
you've lent them the money,

707
00:41:04.871 --> 00:41:09.490
they're promising to pay you back and you value all of those mortgages at $100

708
00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:12.700
million,
the interest rates go down,
the government lowers the interest rates,

709
00:41:12.701 --> 00:41:16.570
half of them take advantage to refinance that pay you back what they owe and

710
00:41:16.571 --> 00:41:20.410
they refinance into a new mortgage.
So now you've only got half the people left.

711
00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.960
Let's say all the people had the same size mortgages and everything,

712
00:41:22.961 --> 00:41:26.620
half the people are left.
Is that shrunken pool?

713
00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:30.790
Half as big as the original pool?
Is that worth 50 million,

714
00:41:30.791 --> 00:41:34.940
half of what it was before or more than 50 or less than 50 million?

715
00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.280
How would you decide that?
Again,

716
00:41:37.281 --> 00:41:40.670
this is a question which might be a little puzzling now,

717
00:41:40.671 --> 00:41:45.650
but actually you should be able to get the sign of that today even.
And um,

718
00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:49.430
and we'll start to analyze it.
So that's what mortgage traders have to do.

719
00:41:49.431 --> 00:41:52.910
They see interest weight,
it's went down.
A bunch of people acted,

720
00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.790
the people were left in the pool are different from the people who started in

721
00:41:55.791 --> 00:41:56.510
the pool.

722
00:41:56.510 --> 00:42:00.110
Now we've got to reevaluate everything and we think at all so well how should we

723
00:42:00.111 --> 00:42:02.500
do that?
Okay.
Um,

724
00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:07.620
let's say you run a hedge fund and some investor comes to you and says,
ah,

725
00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:12.230
things are terrible.
Look at all the money you lost from me last year.
Um,

726
00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:13.071
you know,

727
00:42:13.071 --> 00:42:15.710
I know you're doing great this year and you've made it all back that you lost

728
00:42:15.711 --> 00:42:18.500
last year.
But you know,
I don't want to run that risk.

729
00:42:18.501 --> 00:42:21.320
So I want to give you a month,
my money,
$1 billion.

730
00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:23.810
I want to get the superior returns you seem to earn,

731
00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:26.540
but you have to guarantee that you don't lose me a penny.

732
00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:30.350
I don't want to run any risk.
I want a principal guarantee.

733
00:42:30.351 --> 00:42:33.990
It's called that when I give you $100,
I'll never have,
you know,

734
00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:36.800
you'll always return my hundred dollars and hopefully much more,

735
00:42:36.801 --> 00:42:40.220
but never less than a hundred dollars.
So is there any way to do that?

736
00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:42.590
Or you know,
you know that you're,
you've got a great strategy,

737
00:42:42.591 --> 00:42:44.300
but of course it's risky.
You could lose money.

738
00:42:44.301 --> 00:42:45.950
You've lost money a bunch of times before.

739
00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:50.300
So how can you guarantee the guy that he'll get all his money back and still

740
00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:53.120
have room to run your strategy?
Well,
it sounds like you can't do it,

741
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:55.580
but of course a lot of people want to invest that way,

742
00:42:55.581 --> 00:43:00.020
so there must be a way to do it.
So you'll figure out,
learn how to do that.

743
00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:05.210
So,
uh,
three more short ones.
A scientist discovers a potential cure for aids.

744
00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:09.090
If it works,
he's gonna make a fortune.
He started a company,

745
00:43:09.091 --> 00:43:12.650
it's like Yale scientist,
he's medical school,
started the startup company,
Yale,

746
00:43:12.651 --> 00:43:14.400
of course it's going to take all his profits.
But anyway,

747
00:43:14.401 --> 00:43:17.960
he'd start up company and if this thing really works,

748
00:43:17.961 --> 00:43:21.860
he's going to make a fortune.
If it doesn't work,
it's going to be totally zero.

749
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.800
You calculate and let's say you believe your calculation,

750
00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:28.010
that the expected profits that he'll make if it works,
you know,

751
00:43:28.011 --> 00:43:31.850
the probability of it working times the profits that expected profit is equal to

752
00:43:31.851 --> 00:43:34.040
the profits of all of General Electric.

753
00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:37.790
Should his company would be worth more than General Electric.

754
00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:41.120
The same as general electric or less than General Electric.

755
00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:46.280
Since it's got the same expected profits.
Well,

756
00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:50.480
I can tell you the answer to this one because I think most of you would think

757
00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:53.300
first.
You think,
well maybe the same.
Then you'd say,
well this aids thing,

758
00:43:53.301 --> 00:43:55.760
it's so risky.
It's either going to be way up here or nothing.

759
00:43:55.761 --> 00:43:58.340
And that's so risky and general electric is so solid.

760
00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:01.670
Probably the general electric is worth more.

761
00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:06.530
But the answer is the AIDS company's worth more.
So how could that be?

762
00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:09.710
So,
uh,
another kind of another question.

763
00:44:09.711 --> 00:44:13.730
Suppose you believed in the sufficient market stuff and you rank all the stocks

764
00:44:13.731 --> 00:44:17.690
at the end of this year from top to bottom of which stock had the highest return

765
00:44:17.691 --> 00:44:21.500
over the year.
It was 2010,
let's say 2010.
This year is a weird year.

766
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:23.930
So let's say you do it in 2010 all the stocks,

767
00:44:23.931 --> 00:44:25.760
the highest return to the lowest return.

768
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:31.680
Now suppose you did the same thing in 2011 with the same stocks would expect to

769
00:44:31.681 --> 00:44:34.740
get the same order or the reverse order.

770
00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:37.560
We're random order now.
Again,

771
00:44:37.561 --> 00:44:40.410
if you believe in efficient markets and the markets really functioning,

772
00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:44.910
the prices are fair and all,
I'll bet most of you will say

773
00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:51.220
he won't know,
but you might say,
should be random the next time because you know,

774
00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:55.480
firms only did better or worse by luck,
but that's not right either.

775
00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:59.440
So you're gonna know how to answer that question by the end of the class.
Um,

776
00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:01.270
okay,
one last one.

777
00:45:01.271 --> 00:45:05.590
The Yale endowment over the last 15 years has gotten something like a 15%

778
00:45:05.591 --> 00:45:06.760
annualized return.

779
00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:12.070
I hedge fund that I won't name has gotten 11% over the last 15 years,

780
00:45:12.071 --> 00:45:14.110
counting all its losses and stuff like that.

781
00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:19.680
So is it obvious that the Yale endowment has done better than the hedge fund?

782
00:45:20.171 --> 00:45:23.860
Would you say that the Yale manager is better than the hedge fund manager?

783
00:45:23.861 --> 00:45:26.890
It's returned was 15% the hedge fund only got 11%.

784
00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:30.010
So I'm asking the question.
Um,

785
00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:35.070
and I would say that David Swinson would think about it the same way I think

786
00:45:35.071 --> 00:45:37.190
about it.
So,
um,

787
00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:42.620
suppose I even told you that the Yale Hedge Fund had lower volatility than the

788
00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:48.150
at the Yale hedge from the yell and Darwin had lower volatility than the hedge

789
00:45:48.151 --> 00:45:52.410
fund.
Um,
which it surely does.
Would that,

790
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:53.280
uh,

791
00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:57.420
convince you now that the Yale endowment had been managed better than the hedge

792
00:45:57.421 --> 00:45:58.980
fund?
Well,

793
00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:01.830
we're going to answer this question again and you're going to see that the

794
00:46:01.831 --> 00:46:06.570
answer is a little surprising.
So of,
of who'd be so surprising,

795
00:46:06.571 --> 00:46:09.630
I wouldn't have brought it up at one anyway.
So now the,
but anyway,

796
00:46:09.631 --> 00:46:13.080
that's the kind of thing that in finance you're taught to think about.

797
00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:18.390
So the crisis of 2007,
which you're going to spend a long time talking about.

798
00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:21.700
I just want to get back to that subject.
Okay.
So,
um,
so the,

799
00:46:21.701 --> 00:46:25.140
those lists of questions where the kinds of things that I used to teach for

800
00:46:25.141 --> 00:46:29.010
years before I was confident about my theory of crises.

801
00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:32.370
And this is the kind of questions you have to face all the time at hedge funds

802
00:46:32.371 --> 00:46:35.070
and decisions you have to make and things you have to tell investors.

803
00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:37.530
And so that's,
that's the basic part of the course.

804
00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:42.740
But I want to say more so I want to talk about the crisis of 2007 2009 it

805
00:46:43.051 --> 00:46:45.450
started as a mortgage crisis.
Okay.

806
00:46:45.451 --> 00:46:48.060
Now how could it be that everything goes wrong and mortgages?
I mean,

807
00:46:48.061 --> 00:46:51.510
there are 4,000 years old.
The Babylonians invented mortgages.
You know,

808
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:55.050
what is a mortgage?
You lend somebody money,
they put up collateral,

809
00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:57.960
they don't pay.
You take the house or you take the guy's life,

810
00:46:58.190 --> 00:47:00.360
he's a slave or something.
But it's the same thing.

811
00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:04.350
You put your borrow money and the guy promises you can confiscate something if

812
00:47:04.351 --> 00:47:08.400
he doesn't pay 4,000 years and we screwed it up.
How could that,

813
00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:13.580
how could that be so wa and why should a screw up in the mortgage market have

814
00:47:14.321 --> 00:47:18.030
such a big effect on the rest of the economy?
You know,

815
00:47:18.031 --> 00:47:22.680
were subprime mortgage is a terrible idea or was there some logic to it?
Um,

816
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:29.020
and how did we get out of the crisis?
How is it that everybody was,

817
00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:33.250
this is the worst crisis since the depression may be another depression and

818
00:47:33.251 --> 00:47:34.930
things seemed to have turned around.

819
00:47:34.931 --> 00:47:37.240
What is it that we did to get things to turn around?

820
00:47:37.241 --> 00:47:38.320
I don't think we're out of it yet,

821
00:47:38.321 --> 00:47:40.330
but things are a lot better than they were a year ago.

822
00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:43.030
So what is it that the government did to turn things around?

823
00:47:43.031 --> 00:47:46.330
It didn't do nearly enough,
I think,
but it did something.
What exactly,

824
00:47:46.331 --> 00:47:49.510
what did it do now?
Schiller,
you know,

825
00:47:49.511 --> 00:47:52.150
we'll talk about the whole thing was irrational exuberance,

826
00:47:52.151 --> 00:47:56.110
I'm going to say is all the leverage cycle.
Um,
but anyway,

827
00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:01.030
so that's the mortgage crisis now are free markets.
Good.
Okay.

828
00:48:01.031 --> 00:48:03.190
I want to talk about the argument that the most,

829
00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:06.430
the argument was first made by Adam Smith about the invisible hand.

830
00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:10.270
The modern mathematical argument is Ken Arrow's my thesis advisor.

831
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:12.040
And um,
you know,

832
00:48:12.041 --> 00:48:15.670
of course everybody knows that monopoly and pollution and things like that

833
00:48:15.671 --> 00:48:18.280
interfere with the free market and they have to be regulated.

834
00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.310
But the financial markets,
there's no monopoly.

835
00:48:21.311 --> 00:48:23.830
And as long as there's no monopoly and there's no pollution,

836
00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.290
shouldn't the free market function there.

837
00:48:26.291 --> 00:48:29.350
So I want to go over that argument and show you what was missing in and as I

838
00:48:29.351 --> 00:48:33.850
said before,
and then lastly we're going to talk about social security and a,

839
00:48:33.851 --> 00:48:38.140
you know,
how could that system be going bankrupt?
I mean,
it just seems shocking.

840
00:48:38.141 --> 00:48:40.150
You know,
there's a two Chilean dollar trust fund.

841
00:48:40.151 --> 00:48:44.460
It's going to run out in 10 or in,
you know,
in 2024 or something.

842
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:48.280
And after that the system will be broke.
And uh,

843
00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:51.870
so how did it happen?
Why is it broke?
What can we do to fix it?
You know?

844
00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:54.010
So George Bush said,
well,
it's terrible.

845
00:48:54.011 --> 00:48:57.130
Even if we manage to sort of get the trust fund rehabilitated,

846
00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:01.060
young people like you are going to get a 2% rate of return if you put your money

847
00:49:01.061 --> 00:49:04.000
in the stock.
Even allowing for the last crash over the long haul,

848
00:49:04.001 --> 00:49:07.300
the returns have been 6%.
So it's terrible.
Social Security,

849
00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:11.020
something's wrong with the system.
We should prioritize it and let everybody,

850
00:49:11.021 --> 00:49:13.480
young people,
like you put your money in stocks instead.

851
00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:16.570
Well Gore and the debate in 2000 said,

852
00:49:16.571 --> 00:49:19.600
you can't do that because then the old people are expecting their money can't

853
00:49:19.601 --> 00:49:22.880
get paid.
And both of them agreed that,
you know,

854
00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:26.020
it was all the baby boomers fault.
You know,
people like me,
we're getting old,

855
00:49:26.021 --> 00:49:28.150
we're going to retire.
That's why the system is going to get broken.

856
00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:32.620
So that's the conventional wisdom.
All three of those things are wrong.
Um,

857
00:49:32.621 --> 00:49:36.640
so we're going to find out why.
Okay,
so that's the bait.
So in summary,
you know,

858
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:40.000
why study finance,
it's to understand the financial system,

859
00:49:40.001 --> 00:49:43.420
which is really part of the economic system is to make informed choices.

860
00:49:43.421 --> 00:49:47.200
You know,
is privatizing social security a good or bad thing?
Uh,
you know,

861
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:50.890
as regulation of financial markets,
a good thing,
uh,
you know,

862
00:49:50.891 --> 00:49:53.210
the language that you'll learn is the language that's,

863
00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:57.310
that's spoken on Wall Street and was created by professors and yet practitioners

864
00:49:57.311 --> 00:50:00.270
use it.
It's increased.
I think it's,
for me,
it's incredibly fun.

865
00:50:00.271 --> 00:50:02.320
And all these little puzzles,
as JP Morgan said,

866
00:50:02.321 --> 00:50:04.330
money is just a way of keeping score.
You know,

867
00:50:04.331 --> 00:50:06.130
you have to figure out what something's worth in the end.

868
00:50:06.131 --> 00:50:09.610
And if you get it right,
you've,
you've solved the puzzle,
right?
And,
uh,
you know,

869
00:50:09.611 --> 00:50:11.890
it'll help you make good financial decisions and a potential career.

870
00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:15.760
That's the standard reason to take a financed other prerequisites of the course.

871
00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:19.060
So I want to make this clear,
you don't really need econ one 15,

872
00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:23.200
it will be helpful because this logic of the free market being good or bad,

873
00:50:23.201 --> 00:50:25.810
you know,
that was already started an econ one 15,

874
00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:31.100
that's what they call it now don't,
right?
Still called one 15.
Right?
So,
um,

875
00:50:31.101 --> 00:50:34.130
I used to teach it,
but I haven't done it for years.
So anyway,
um,

876
00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:37.520
what you really need is mathematical self confidence.

877
00:50:37.521 --> 00:50:40.580
It's not going to be high math.
It's going to be simple math,

878
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:42.680
but it's relentless over and over again.

879
00:50:42.681 --> 00:50:47.420
And I can tell you that every year there's the 5% of the s you know,
of you,

880
00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:51.920
let's say five or 10 out of the hundred 20 are going to just get bored doing

881
00:50:51.921 --> 00:50:54.700
problem after problem.
And you're probably not that,
you know,

882
00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:57.260
those 10 maybe haven't that much experience doing it.

883
00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:58.760
Don't feel very confident doing it.

884
00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:03.280
Stop coming to the class and then really have no idea what's going on.
So if,

885
00:51:03.281 --> 00:51:07.490
you know,
my sister is probably much smarter than I am,

886
00:51:07.491 --> 00:51:10.820
but she doesn't like math,
I wouldn't,
you know,
she wouldn't take this course.

887
00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:13.940
So if you're not confident doing little mathematical problems,

888
00:51:13.941 --> 00:51:16.250
just don't take the course,
you'll save yourself a lot of trouble.

889
00:51:16.251 --> 00:51:18.800
I don't know how to say this any better.
I want to warn you not to do it.

890
00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:21.080
It's easy math,
but it never stops.

891
00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:25.460
Every week there's going to be a problem set the exam,
their problem sets,

892
00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:28.370
the exam is doing problems just like the problem sets.

893
00:51:28.371 --> 00:51:33.350
But if you don't like that,
you know,
to me,
uh,
finance is a quantitative subject.

894
00:51:33.351 --> 00:51:34.430
What's so beautiful about it.

895
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:39.680
And one aspect I really like is that you have these complicated different things

896
00:51:39.681 --> 00:51:43.040
you have to weigh.
But at the end you have to come up with one number.

897
00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:45.590
What is the price you're willing to pay for something?

898
00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:49.310
It's very concrete and I'm going to take advantage of the concreteness by

899
00:51:49.311 --> 00:51:51.200
turning every question into,
to a number.

900
00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:54.020
I hate it when you get on the one hand and on the other hand and you know,

901
00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:57.860
you know it's the number.
And so the,
so if you don't like numbers,

902
00:51:57.861 --> 00:52:01.100
it's not a good course to take.
So what are the kinds of things you have to know?

903
00:52:01.101 --> 00:52:05.930
You have to understand the distributor law of Arithmetic,
you know,
which,
uh,
I,

904
00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:08.930
I have little kids and I see that's not so easy to understand anyway.

905
00:52:08.931 --> 00:52:10.670
And then you have to understand the idea of a function,

906
00:52:10.671 --> 00:52:12.080
which is a contingent plan.

907
00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:16.850
Simultaneous equations as we do for equilibrium in arbitrage taking a

908
00:52:16.851 --> 00:52:20.720
derivative.
That's marginal utility,
the idea of diminishing marginal utility,

909
00:52:20.721 --> 00:52:25.460
a concave function that's looks like that.
That's risk aversion.
You know,

910
00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:29.210
bankers invented the logarithm compound interest.

911
00:52:29.211 --> 00:52:32.570
You have to know what taking a log rhythm and the exponential means,

912
00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:36.410
and you have to understand how to take probability weighted averages and things.

913
00:52:36.411 --> 00:52:39.860
And,
and we're gonna use Xcel for a lot of the problems which we'll teach you,

914
00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:41.510
which you can learn in that by the end of the day,

915
00:52:41.511 --> 00:52:43.610
you'll be better at it than I am.
Uh,

916
00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:46.820
so my office hours or four to six,

917
00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:50.990
my secretary is rent assistant,
has rent day,
there's an accent missing.

918
00:52:50.991 --> 00:52:53.750
And she always tells me Wilson,
she just started three days ago,

919
00:52:53.751 --> 00:52:54.770
but I'm sure she'll be great.

920
00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:57.230
They're going to be two lectures a week and a ta section.

921
00:52:57.231 --> 00:53:00.530
So every Tuesday there'll be a problem set starting this Tuesday,

922
00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:03.410
do the next Tuesday there'll be two midterms.
You know,

923
00:53:03.411 --> 00:53:04.750
there's a lot of stuff to learn and,

924
00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:07.970
and so I found everybody I think agrees who's taken the course.

925
00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:11.480
If you take the midterm,
it will focus your mind and make it a lot easier.

926
00:53:11.481 --> 00:53:13.850
So I give two of them's,
you only have half the course to study.

927
00:53:13.851 --> 00:53:16.250
It makes the final much easier to study for.

928
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:19.430
I recognize that some of you will have problems on one of like,

929
00:53:19.431 --> 00:53:21.110
especially the first midterm.

930
00:53:21.350 --> 00:53:25.410
And if you do vastly worse than one exam than the rest,
I'll tend to ignore that.

931
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:30.600
Um,
but most people don't by the way,
do vastly worse on one exam and the rest.
Um,

932
00:53:30.601 --> 00:53:31.710
so then finals 40,

933
00:53:31.711 --> 00:53:35.700
the problem sets 20 and the two midterms or 20 Tuesday to Tuesday.

934
00:53:35.701 --> 00:53:38.010
And so all the ta sessions or Thursday to Monday,

935
00:53:38.011 --> 00:53:41.910
so they're going to start next Thursday.
So you see the two classes,

936
00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:43.680
you know the classes are Tuesday,
Thursday,

937
00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:46.020
then the next Tuesday there's a long time in between here.

938
00:53:46.021 --> 00:53:47.880
So all the ta sessions we'll meet there.

939
00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:51.380
So are there at the same moment in the class,
I don't have a t.

940
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:54.540
There are all these textbooks all by the Nobel prize winners all by those

941
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:59.130
financial grades.
You can buy any one of them.
Um,
but I have my own lecture notes.

942
00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:00.270
Uh,
cause as I say,

943
00:54:00.271 --> 00:54:04.020
I take us teach a slightly unconventional course and there's a huge list of

944
00:54:04.021 --> 00:54:07.470
books on the crisis and some of them are incredibly interesting and fun.

945
00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:10.200
And so they're all on the reading list.
You can take a look at.

946
00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:14.670
I mean there's never been a more fun time to read this stuff now.
Um,

947
00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:19.710
okay.
So of course improvements anyway,
so I'm gonna now.
Okay,
so that's it.

948
00:54:19.711 --> 00:54:24.060
Are there any questions about how the course runs or how I will run it or

949
00:54:24.061 --> 00:54:27.330
whether you think you should take the course or whether your preparation.

950
00:54:27.331 --> 00:54:29.850
So if you haven't taken econ 15 it's okay.

951
00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:34.140
One 15 but you've got to be confident that you can solve problems otherwise

952
00:54:34.141 --> 00:54:38.520
don't do it.
Any questions?
Yes,

953
00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:40.560
it will be a second next.
Yeah.

954
00:54:40.561 --> 00:54:43.770
So next Tuesday it's going to be due the Tuesday after.
So I know it's early,

955
00:54:43.771 --> 00:54:44.604
but you know,

956
00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:47.460
you probably already know whether you're going to take the course or not.
Yes,

957
00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:49.053
<v 1>next year.</v>

958
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:51.580
<v 0>Well I teach at next year.
Um,</v>

959
00:54:51.730 --> 00:54:54.340
actually I probably won't because I'm going to go on leave,
but I might,

960
00:54:54.550 --> 00:54:59.260
but probably not.
But you,
you know,
someone else will teach it.
Yup.

961
00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:01.723
<v 1>Yes.</v>

962
00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:06.460
<v 0>I don't really suggest,
you know,
but they're all good.
So they're all,
you know,</v>

963
00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:10.530
they're all famous people have written,
the books are too,
you know,

964
00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:14.390
they're trying to sell copies so they're pitched at a quite low level and

965
00:55:14.391 --> 00:55:18.500
they're,
but they're very good.
So I would,
you know,
any one of them is good.

966
00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:21.710
Miller's book,
um,
Merton's book is good.

967
00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:24.830
So is Steve Ross is a friend of mine.
He used to teach at Yale,

968
00:55:24.831 --> 00:55:28.190
so his book is good.
So any one of those is very good,

969
00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:31.970
but they're not quite at the same mathematical level because they're trying to

970
00:55:31.971 --> 00:55:32.631
sell,
you know,

971
00:55:32.631 --> 00:55:37.230
thousands of bucks and they stick quit pretty,

972
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:40.850
pretty closely to this financial view of the world that everything's efficient.

973
00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:42.673
Yes.

974
00:55:42.810 --> 00:55:43.643
<v 1>Rolling.</v>

975
00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:48.660
<v 0>Oh,
that's a good question.
I don't think so.
No.</v>

976
00:55:48.661 --> 00:55:51.570
They're shaking their head so it won't be in time for you,

977
00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:55.380
but it will be if you want to look back in your old age.

978
00:55:57.330 --> 00:56:01.050
I was there.
I saw the leverage cycle.

979
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:03.370
Sorry.
Yes.

980
00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:12.780
Oh,
the lecture notes are all posted a already before the class.

981
00:56:12.781 --> 00:56:15.480
So the first 12 of them are there and I'm gonna,
you know,
I'm changing.

982
00:56:15.481 --> 00:56:17.540
I'm each year,
so there'll be some changes.

983
00:56:17.541 --> 00:56:20.340
So last year his first 12 were there and they might change a little bit,

984
00:56:20.341 --> 00:56:22.560
but you can already get an idea of what they're about.

985
00:56:22.561 --> 00:56:24.060
This first lecture is not on,

986
00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:29.560
<v 1>um,
but the rest of them aren't.
Any other questions?</v>

987
00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:32.800
Yes.
When did we send out?

988
00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:36.710
<v 0>Oh,
you should be signing up now.
I think it's,</v>

989
00:56:36.711 --> 00:56:39.900
I don't know how to do this online or something.
Right.
You sign up online.
Yeah.

990
00:56:39.901 --> 00:56:41.060
So you should pick your sections.

991
00:56:41.061 --> 00:56:45.980
We might add another section if all of you stay,
but you know,
probably you won't.

992
00:56:45.981 --> 00:56:49.160
So,
but if we do,
we'll add another ta section.

993
00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:52.840
<v 1>Okay.
Yes.
What's degree distribution?</v>

994
00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:55.030
<v 0>Great Distribution.
I don't know.</v>

995
00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:58.840
The Standard Yale junior level course grade distribution,

996
00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:03.100
which is,
you know,
when I was at Yale,

997
00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:07.000
things where my things weren't much tougher.
But um,

998
00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:09.610
so it's the standard distribution.
I don't remember it off hand,

999
00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.940
but I'll tell you all about the distribution at the midterm.

1000
00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:15.530
So there'll be a midterm before you have a chance to,

1001
00:57:15.550 --> 00:57:18.250
you have a chance to drop the course after the midterm and,

1002
00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:21.490
and then there'll be another midterm right at the end of the day.

1003
00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:22.820
<v 1>Of course,
yes.</v>

1004
00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:31.640
<v 0>Okay.
I was trying to say that.
I'm glad you asked me again.</v>

1005
00:57:31.641 --> 00:57:34.730
So I went over the things you have to know,
you have to be able to take,

1006
00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:37.220
if you have three x minus four x squared,

1007
00:57:37.310 --> 00:57:40.760
you have to be able to take the derivative of that just three minus eight x.

1008
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:44.900
If you've got the log natural of x,
you have to take the derivative.

1009
00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:45.980
It's one over x.

1010
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:51.190
If you've got three x plus five equals 10 and two x minus seven equals 12 you

1011
00:57:51.441 --> 00:57:53.690
have to be able to solve that simultaneous equation.

1012
00:57:54.110 --> 00:57:57.440
So that's the kind of thing you have to do and you have to be able to do it

1013
00:57:58.130 --> 00:58:01.190
quickly and with total confidence that you're doing it right.

1014
00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:06.050
And you know from up,
for many of you,
that's no problem.

1015
00:58:06.051 --> 00:58:08.840
But for some of you who are maybe even smarter than everybody else,

1016
00:58:08.841 --> 00:58:09.650
that's a problem.

1017
00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:14.650
And so you'll have to judge yourself whether you can do that comfortably.

1018
00:58:15.081 --> 00:58:17.030
So you don't have to worry about the mechanics of doing that.

1019
00:58:17.031 --> 00:58:19.490
You can think conceptually about what the question's asking.

1020
00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:22.790
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1021
00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:25.970
<v 0>All right.
I want to do one x that we have.
When does this end?</v>

1022
00:58:25.971 --> 00:58:30.170
10 of or quarter of or
10 of.
Okay.

1023
00:58:30.171 --> 00:58:34.430
So we have 15,
13 minutes.
So I want to end with one experiment.

1024
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:38.330
So,
um,
be gay.
Can you help me with this?

1025
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:42.110
So this is something we're not going to have time to figure out the answer to,

1026
00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:46.180
but
so,
okay,
so what I have,

1027
00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:49.550
so I need 16 volunteers.
How about the first two roles?

1028
00:58:49.551 --> 00:58:53.810
Why don't you just volunteer?
You'll survive and you know,
I know it's a drag,

1029
00:58:53.811 --> 00:58:58.810
but you'll do it.
Okay.
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to just,

1030
00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:01.490
I'm going to run an auction.

1031
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:04.460
So please stand up and eight of you go to this site,
eight,

1032
00:59:04.461 --> 00:59:07.130
come over here and that's okay.
You'll be okay.

1033
00:59:07.131 --> 00:59:10.700
I know everyone's reluctant to do this,
so I only need 16 be gay.

1034
00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:13.950
Help me count them.
Two,
four,
six,
eight.
Okay.
You,

1035
00:59:13.951 --> 00:59:17.000
you guys have to come the other way.
The TA's aren't going to participate.

1036
00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:23.060
You don't need to,
yeah,
you're not in this,
right?
Yeah.
No.

1037
00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:28.720
Two,
four,
six,
eight.
So we only need eight would you?
My weight.

1038
00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:31.670
One of you.
You both sat down.
So would you like to participate?
Come on.

1039
00:59:31.671 --> 00:59:36.500
We can use another woman here.
Okay.
Two,
four,
six,
eight.
There are eight of them.

1040
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:38.480
Okay.
So can you mix these up?

1041
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:43.510
They're going to be eight sellers and eight you say seller,

1042
00:59:43.521 --> 00:59:46.760
right?
Buyer.
So shuffle them up and handle on teach.
Okay,

1043
00:59:46.761 --> 00:59:49.100
so we've got eight and these are the football they're selling.

1044
00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:51.500
So we've got eight sellers and eight buyers.

1045
00:59:51.501 --> 00:59:54.080
And I don't know whether you've ever seen this experiment before.

1046
00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:58.880
I didn't one but shuffle them right there in,

1047
01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:01.581
they're all sellers,

1048
01:00:01.581 --> 01:00:04.820
but you've got to shuffle them on the other side is a number.
Okay?

1049
01:00:04.821 --> 01:00:09.050
So we've got eight sellers here and eight buyers.

1050
01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:12.260
So each seller knows,
um,

1051
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:16.700
what his football ticket is worth or hurt.
So please take one.

1052
01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:19.953
<v 2>Thank you,</v>

1053
01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:25.190
<v 0>mark giving you so many others.
Oh,
you have a seller one.
That's bad.
Yeah,</v>

1054
01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:29.540
I'm blind.
Thank you.
By earth.
Thank you.
There's just say buyer and buyer.

1055
01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:35.540
Okay.
You shouldn't be one short.
Here's an extra.
Did you?
Okay.

1056
01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.810
Okay.
So there are eight sellers and eight buyers.

1057
01:00:38.811 --> 01:00:40.460
They've got the football tickets.

1058
01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:44.690
Each of them knows what the football ticket is worth to her.
Okay.

1059
01:00:44.691 --> 01:00:48.560
We'll be three women here,
only two.
So these are the hers,
they,

1060
01:00:48.561 --> 01:00:51.860
each one of them now she knows exactly what it's worth to her.

1061
01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:57.070
So say it's 15 football tickets worth 15 now she can sell it for more than 15

1062
01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:59.900
she's going to do it.
She's going to make a profit.

1063
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:04.790
If she sells it for less than 15 she's not a very good trader.

1064
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.190
Okay.
She's not going to do that.
She's going to say,

1065
01:01:07.191 --> 01:01:10.160
if I can get more than the football ticket is worth,
I'm going to sell it.

1066
01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:14.480
If I can get worse,
if I can't get more than it's worth,
I won't sell it.
Okay.

1067
01:01:14.481 --> 01:01:19.220
So everybody knows what the football ticket is worth to herself.
All these guys,

1068
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:20.930
they know what the ticket is worth to them.

1069
01:01:20.931 --> 01:01:24.050
So say someone thinks it's worth 30 that guy's going to say,

1070
01:01:24.051 --> 01:01:28.640
if I can get it for less than 30 like for 15 I'm going to get it.
If I can get,

1071
01:01:28.641 --> 01:01:28.791
you know,

1072
01:01:28.791 --> 01:01:32.690
they'll give me a profit of 15 if I can only get it for 40 I'm sure not going to

1073
01:01:32.691 --> 01:01:35.480
do that because I'm paying more than I think it's worth.
Okay,

1074
01:01:35.481 --> 01:01:38.570
so you all got that.
You have a reservation value yourself.

1075
01:01:38.571 --> 01:01:42.140
You don't want to pay more than it's worth because then you're losing money and

1076
01:01:42.141 --> 01:01:44.570
they want to sell it for more than they think it's worth cause then they're

1077
01:01:44.571 --> 01:01:46.070
making money.
Okay.

1078
01:01:46.071 --> 01:01:51.071
So nobody knows anybody else's valuation that the information is distributed

1079
01:01:51.951 --> 01:01:55.310
completely randomly across the class.
Now this is a famous experiment.

1080
01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:57.650
I'm not the first one to run it off.
I've done it for 10 years.

1081
01:01:57.651 --> 01:02:01.200
I do it my graduate class in my undergraduate class,
the undergraduates,

1082
01:02:01.201 --> 01:02:04.380
and by the way,
I always do better than the graduate students.
But anyway,
so the,

1083
01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:09.590
this knowledge is distributed in the whole environment and we're going to see

1084
01:02:09.591 --> 01:02:14.360
what happens when I start a chaotic interaction between all of these 16 people.

1085
01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.620
What's going to happen?

1086
01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:19.440
And you would think it'd be total chaos and nothing sensible is going to happen.

1087
01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:22.020
And I,
if that does happen,
it'll be very embarrassing for me.

1088
01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:26.760
But what the efficient markets guys would say is something amazing is going to

1089
01:02:26.761 --> 01:02:30.540
happen.
The market is going to discover what everybody thinks it's worth and,

1090
01:02:30.541 --> 01:02:33.330
and figure out exactly the best and right thing to do.

1091
01:02:33.331 --> 01:02:34.380
And that's what's going to happen.

1092
01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:39.000
Now it's hard to believe that with this little preparation that you've had zero,

1093
01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:41.580
zero training,
zero experience,

1094
01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:43.560
and they're only going to have two minutes to do this.

1095
01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:46.900
So we see the classes got eight minutes to go.
You're not gonna,

1096
01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:51.090
you're gonna miss the grand finale anyway,
so you're only gonna go.
So with only,

1097
01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:55.320
uh,
only two minutes of trading,
they're going to get to a result,

1098
01:02:55.321 --> 01:02:58.490
which if I had to do it myself and read all the numbers and sort the mountain

1099
01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.570
sort throw them would take me much more than two minutes.

1100
01:03:00.690 --> 01:03:02.100
And all of this is going to happen in two minutes.

1101
01:03:02.101 --> 01:03:06.210
It's hard to believe it probably won't happen this time.
So here are the rules.

1102
01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:09.840
I'm going to put you all together and start inching your way towards each other.

1103
01:03:11.850 --> 01:03:15.990
Okay?
And try not,
okay.
Now when I say go,

1104
01:03:15.991 --> 01:03:19.260
which won't be for two minutes,
you're going to start yelling out an offer.

1105
01:03:19.261 --> 01:03:21.420
So if you think it's worth 15 and you're a seller,

1106
01:03:21.421 --> 01:03:23.370
you're not going to sell it for 15 you're going to say,

1107
01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:26.100
give me 20 or giving me 30 or giving me,
you know,

1108
01:03:26.101 --> 01:03:29.130
25 you're going to try and get as much as you can.
You have to yell it out.

1109
01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:32.130
Someone else,
you know,
the buyers are going to making their offers.

1110
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:36.000
When two of you see that there's a deal,
you have to shake hands,

1111
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:40.380
exchange the football and leave and tell your numbers to be gay.
Where's be gay.

1112
01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.400
Okay.
Be Gay.
You're gonna stand outside the group

1113
01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:49.910
outside the box that way.
Okay.
So once you make a deal,

1114
01:03:49.911 --> 01:03:53.360
you just leave and tell what's happened to be gay.
Okay?

1115
01:03:53.570 --> 01:03:58.100
Who's now standing back here?
Back there.
Okay.
So you,
uh,

1116
01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.750
so it has to be public outcry.

1117
01:03:59.751 --> 01:04:02.330
It's very important that you're yelling these things publicly and every,

1118
01:04:02.331 --> 01:04:05.360
all the other people can hear you.
And you've only got two minutes now.

1119
01:04:05.361 --> 01:04:08.060
Two minutes sounds like two minutes.

1120
01:04:08.061 --> 01:04:10.640
Sounds like an incredibly short period of time,
which it is,

1121
01:04:10.641 --> 01:04:15.590
but it's much longer than you think.
You wait quiet here,
you shouldn't trade.

1122
01:04:15.591 --> 01:04:17.330
I'm giving you valuable advice.
You shouldn't.

1123
01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:21.980
You should not trade in the first 10 or 15 seconds cause you have to hear what

1124
01:04:21.981 --> 01:04:23.990
everybody else is offering.
If you trade right away,

1125
01:04:23.991 --> 01:04:27.650
you're probably doing something really stupid.
Two minutes.
No,
it sounds short.

1126
01:04:27.651 --> 01:04:31.070
It's actually a very long period of time.
So be patient.

1127
01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:34.490
Try to get the best possible price and we'll see what happens.

1128
01:04:34.491 --> 01:04:37.910
Any questions about what you're doing?
And now in the heat of the moment,

1129
01:04:37.911 --> 01:04:38.631
you might,
you know,

1130
01:04:38.631 --> 01:04:42.200
be so frustrated that you can't sell when you think it's worth 15 that you sell

1131
01:04:42.201 --> 01:04:46.220
it for 10 I'm going to expose you in front of all these people who do that.

1132
01:04:46.221 --> 01:04:50.900
So keep track of what you think is worth.
All right?
Any questions?

1133
01:04:50.901 --> 01:04:55.100
Anybody about what a is going on?
Okay,
so you have two minutes.

1134
01:04:55.101 --> 01:04:57.020
Is there a second hand there?
I can't see it.

1135
01:04:57.310 --> 01:04:58.143
<v 1>No,</v>

1136
01:05:01.810 --> 01:05:03.230
<v 0>it's,
it's on the,
where is it?</v>

1137
01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:10.850
It's on the three.
Okay.
I think I see something.
Okay,
so when it gets to the four,

1138
01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:14.390
we're going to start.
So start,
go.

1139
01:05:44.770 --> 01:05:45.603
<v 4>Oh no,</v>

1140
01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:00.390
he made a deal.
Tell gay

1141
01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:12.830
how much time is left?
Like one minute left.
Okay.
Plenty of time.
One minute.

1142
01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:25.000
Okay.
Any other deal made
right down the price and the two.

1143
01:06:25.001 --> 01:06:26.770
Uh,
what price they agreed.

1144
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:40.490
How much time?
25 seconds.

1145
01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:41.900
Stay.
Cool.

1146
01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:53.000
How much time?
How much time?
I can't see it.

1147
01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:57.800
15 stay cool.
Don't make any mistakes.

1148
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Ten five,

1149
01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:12.140
four,
three,
two,
one stop.

1150
01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:16.870
Okay.
Did you get all the numbers?
How much was it?

1151
01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:32.820
Give me back the tickets.

1152
01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.440
The tickets in the mind is to make it look bad on camera.

1153
01:07:36.570 --> 01:07:41.030
You're gonna look great on camera.
You are
okay.

1154
01:07:41.031 --> 01:07:44.890
Give me all the tickets.
Back to collusion word.
It's a good idea.

1155
01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:49.740
Okay.
Be Gay.
You're getting done there.
Okay.
Well with tickets,

1156
01:07:49.741 --> 01:07:53.520
I need them all back.
And all this stuff come out of your big folders here.

1157
01:07:53.521 --> 01:07:58.290
You know this,
these tickets have lasted 10 years till you guys took over.

1158
01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:03.510
Oh,
okay.
There are their own crumpled up and okay.

1159
01:08:03.570 --> 01:08:07.170
All the tickets here.
I meet them all back.
Okay,
you can sit down now.

1160
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:08.870
Everybody's reported in.

1161
01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:15.530
Okay,
now let's see what happened.

1162
01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.690
<v 2>Okay?
Yep.
Okay.</v>

1163
01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:40.130
<v 0>Five,
five traded,
five.
Five bought and sold.
Okay.</v>

1164
01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:45.360
Okay,
so Stan.
Okay,
so here's what happened here.
Where the numbers,
okay,

1165
01:08:45.361 --> 01:08:47.310
so we have five minutes just to look at this.

1166
01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:51.930
So all the buyer prices are in blue,

1167
01:08:51.931 --> 01:08:56.640
44 40 36 you should recognize these you buyers and the red ones where the

1168
01:08:56.641 --> 01:09:00.570
sellers.
So you notice that every seller for everybody,

1169
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:02.670
there's a seller who's underneath.
Okay?

1170
01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:07.671
So it could have happened that 38th sold to 44 and 34 sold to 40 at 37 and 28

1171
01:09:09.121 --> 01:09:13.000
sold to 36 and 32 all that could've,

1172
01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:17.490
you could've had eight trades.
So what did happen?
Nothing like that happened.

1173
01:09:17.491 --> 01:09:21.050
You had five trades,
five pairs of people traded and they're loose.

1174
01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:25.830
Three poor schlumps pairs of people at the end looking,
despondent,

1175
01:09:26.190 --> 01:09:30.960
hopeless,
unable to trade,
worry that they were on camera.
So

1176
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:36.990
now let's see who are the people who traded?

1177
01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:38.550
So be gay.

1178
01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:42.510
Name the buyers who bought,

1179
01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:49.610
you don't need to buy the prices.
No.

1180
01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:56.450
Okay.
It was all quick.
So I don't have everybody's name.
They were all the,

1181
01:09:56.451 --> 01:10:00.450
the of you didn't get the,
you got them.
Okay,
great.
Okay,

1182
01:10:00.451 --> 01:10:03.040
so here's what happened.
Um,

1183
01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:07.920
Mr. Seller 10 sold the 36 at a price of 20.

1184
01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:10.290
Mr. Seller,

1185
01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:15.320
nine sold to buy or 29 there is no nine

1186
01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:17.953
<v 2>oh six</v>

1187
01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:22.860
<v 0>nine sold to 20 at a price of six.</v>

1188
01:10:24.230 --> 01:10:24.990
That's okay.

1189
01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:29.990
So seller six sold at a price to 20 at a price of 20

1190
01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:40.730
no,
no by or 20 paid 20 so sellers six did.

1191
01:10:40.731 --> 01:10:42.020
Well we won't ask who?

1192
01:10:42.021 --> 01:10:46.310
Buyer 20th buyer 20 okay.

1193
01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:51.320
It's going to screw everything up.
So buyer a 14 through,

1194
01:10:51.321 --> 01:10:52.550
I can't read this either.

1195
01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:58.440
44 buyer 14 sold to buyer 44 for 20 and buyer 20 sold to buyer 40 for 22 and and

1196
01:11:03.170 --> 01:11:08.170
buyer 24 sold to seller 24 sold to buyer 34 25 okay,

1197
01:11:09.681 --> 01:11:13.070
so five people traded now which five were they?

1198
01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:18.200
Sellers were ten six 14 and 24 one two three four five the bottom five,

1199
01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:20.070
the five buyers,

1200
01:11:20.370 --> 01:11:25.370
we're 30 we're 36 2044 40 and 30 so basically the 444036302016 bike,

1201
01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:35.700
20 buttons dead.
So if you look at it,

1202
01:11:35.730 --> 01:11:38.070
so it's not quite the way theory would have predicted,

1203
01:11:38.071 --> 01:11:40.830
but almost if you look at it,
um,

1204
01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:50.560
if you look at it,
if you just shuffle the,
the,
the,

1205
01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:53.820
the order and he put the sellers instead of from top to bottom,

1206
01:11:53.821 --> 01:11:55.460
you just put them from bottom to top.

1207
01:11:55.610 --> 01:11:59.720
You get what looks like a demand curve and a supply curve.
And so what happened,

1208
01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:04.340
all these five people ended up selling one,
two,
three,
four,
five.

1209
01:12:04.341 --> 01:12:05.810
Those were exactly the sellers.

1210
01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:10.310
The price they sold for was all between 20 and 25 and the five buyers were

1211
01:12:10.311 --> 01:12:15.311
444036302016 manage to buy but 20 baht.

1212
01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:19.850
So basically the fee.
So what is what,
so what is the free,

1213
01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.500
what is the theory of the free market?

1214
01:12:21.501 --> 01:12:24.770
The theory of the free market says this chaotic situation where they had less

1215
01:12:24.771 --> 01:12:26.570
than two minutes to decide what to do,

1216
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:31.250
could be analyzed as if you put a demand curve together with a supply curve.

1217
01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:34.550
And there was one price that they miraculously new here it was,

1218
01:12:34.551 --> 01:12:35.780
should have been 25.

1219
01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:39.890
It turned out to be 20 or 22 that all the trades took place that at that one

1220
01:12:39.891 --> 01:12:41.930
price you get all the trades happening.

1221
01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:44.420
The people who have the highest valuation buyers,

1222
01:12:44.450 --> 01:12:45.890
they're the ones who get the tickets.

1223
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:48.470
The people with the lowest valuation sellers sell it.

1224
01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:52.100
So the people who end up with the tickets are these red guys at the top.

1225
01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:53.540
And the blue guys at the top,

1226
01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:58.040
all the tickets go from the least good God will delete,
not good least.
Uh,

1227
01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:01.430
people value the stuff at least to the people who value it more.

1228
01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:04.640
So the market has done an extraordinary thing and two minutes.

1229
01:13:04.641 --> 01:13:08.690
So there was one mistake,
Mister or miss 20,

1230
01:13:08.691 --> 01:13:13.280
whose identity we are protecting,
although I'm searching the faces,

1231
01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:17.810
Mister or miss 20 got a very bad deal.
She or he,

1232
01:13:17.811 --> 01:13:22.010
let's say he bought a 21,
the value was 20.
That was a horrible deal.

1233
01:13:22.011 --> 01:13:25.850
He so he,
he shouldn't have,
you know,
he didn't get any extra out of it.

1234
01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:30.660
So he should probably have only bought if the price were lower and then 26 would

1235
01:13:30.661 --> 01:13:34.670
have bought instead of 20.
So 20 sort of squeezed his way into the market.

1236
01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:38.600
So 26 and 20 between them,
somehow there was a slight inefficiency,

1237
01:13:38.601 --> 01:13:43.130
but basically with no training,
no background,
no practice.

1238
01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:48.110
These 16 undergraduates managed to reproduce.
They gathered all the information,

1239
01:13:48.111 --> 01:13:48.771
the whole economy,

1240
01:13:48.771 --> 01:13:51.710
and they discovered who are the fifth who are the eight and the,
sorry,

1241
01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:55.970
when were the 16 the eight people who valued the tickets to the most and they

1242
01:13:55.971 --> 01:13:59.090
ended up with all the tickets,
you know,
for me to do it and sort it out.

1243
01:13:59.091 --> 01:14:00.050
We're take him longer.

1244
01:14:00.051 --> 01:14:04.040
The market solves a complicated problem and gets information incredibly quickly

1245
01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:06.980
and puts things into the hands of the people who value it the most.

1246
01:14:07.190 --> 01:14:10.760
And the marginal buyer thought it was worth about 25 or 20 and that's what the

1247
01:14:10.761 --> 01:14:14.140
price turned out to be.
So anyway,
we're going to come back to this parable,

1248
01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:15.410
the beginning of the next class.
