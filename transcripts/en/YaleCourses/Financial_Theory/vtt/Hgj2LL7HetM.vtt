1
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.390
Oh next,
this class and the next,
uh,

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.380
class and a half are going to be about the end,

3
00:00:08.381 --> 00:00:10.560
the fishers theory of the,

4
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:14.700
about Fisher's theory of present value and the interest rate.

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.980
Uh,
and then we're gonna move to uncertainty,
but I'm going to,

6
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:20.814
uh,

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.680
so we've up till now what we've done is we found out first how if you know the

8
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:26.850
whole economic system,

9
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:30.540
how to solve for equilibrium to figure out from the primitives of people's

10
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:34.320
tastes.
They're inpatients,
the technology of the economy,

11
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.860
how to figure out what the real rate of interest is provided there's no

12
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:41.850
uncertainty in the world and people can forecast what's going to happen later.

13
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.710
We found that once you've done that,
the price of every asset,

14
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.350
if people are rational and looking forward to the future,

15
00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:54.351
the price of every asset is going to be the present value of the future payments

16
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:58.170
of the acid.
So if you think of the payments as real payments,

17
00:00:58.171 --> 00:00:59.940
which is what fish are always recommended,

18
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.050
you discount by the real interest rate.
If you think of them as cash payments,

19
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.210
then you discount by the nominal interest rate.

20
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.390
So every asset corresponds to its present value of its dividends,

21
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.440
either discounted by the real rate or the nominal rate.

22
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.860
Now this thinking is surprisingly powerful and leads you to unexpected

23
00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:27.150
conclusions and the the,
the uh,
so the,
the next class,

24
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.980
the next two classes is about that.

25
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.200
Mostly I'm going to talk about social security,

26
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.610
but I'm going to begin today by finishing off a subject we didn't quite get

27
00:01:35.611 --> 00:01:38.850
through last time.
So you see,

28
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:43.410
if you realize that the price of every asset is just the present value of its

29
00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:47.610
dividends and you also suppose that you know what the dividends are going to be

30
00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:49.680
and what the future interest rates are going to be,

31
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.420
then it follows that you know what the price of the acid is going to be not just

32
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:57.600
today but next year and the year after and the year after that.

33
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.060
So your theory of asset pricing today,

34
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:03.990
which was based on the assumption that you can forecast the future necessarily

35
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:06.570
implies a theory of acid pricing in the future.

36
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.470
So you can tell something about how asset prices are going to change.

37
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.220
And of course you can also test the theory because the theory implicitly is

38
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:17.460
forecasting something about the future.
And if you,

39
00:02:17.461 --> 00:02:18.930
and therefore you can test the theory.

40
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.440
So let's just take a couple examples that are in the notes.

41
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.000
So we said at the top,
if you can read it,
I hope it's not too small.
I,
uh,

42
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.660
want to move a little quickly so I could be writing on this and the board,

43
00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:36.030
but if you can see it and you look at the top line,

44
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.300
it says that the present value of assets is just equal to the present.

45
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.770
The present value of assets is just equal to their future.
The present value,

46
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.080
the present value of the assets.
It's just a discount of,
of future dividends.

47
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.880
So maybe I'll start one line up actually in these notes.

48
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.620
Okay.
So if you look in the middle here,
the present value today,

49
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:05.500
suppose you have an acid.
Maybe I'm going to write on the board.
After all,

50
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.360
president,
family,
man,
I said,
suppose you know,

51
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:12.361
the dividends are going to be paying c one c two and maybe CT at the end.

52
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.950
Those are the dividends.
They're going to be paid.

53
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.720
And you can ask what the present value of the acid is today.
Pv,
uh,

54
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.960
today?
Zero.
Well,
Fisher would say,

55
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:27.640
if you think of these as nominal cash flows,
he would say the first,

56
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.690
what you need to do is you need to find out the price of Zeros.

57
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.900
So you'll recall that Fisher said that you could let pie won equal the price

58
00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:38.074
today.

59
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

60
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.370
<v 0>Of $1 at time one.
Okay.</v>

61
00:03:44.371 --> 00:03:49.371
And the price today pie a t equals the price today of $1 at time T.

62
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.110
Okay.
It's the price today
of $1 in the future.

63
00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:58.800
These were the crucial prices that Fisher said that you should always look for.

64
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.290
He said that you can always find these prices.

65
00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:05.010
Pie one through Pi Ti by deriving them from the yield curve.

66
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.160
So every morning everybody looks at the yield curve.

67
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.000
All financial analysts,
they look at the prices of bonds traded in the market.

68
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.290
You know,
the simplest form.
As you get a yield curve in the newspapers,

69
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.330
you deduced from the yield curve what these present values,

70
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.350
Pi one Pi tr and that allows you to price any acid like this one simply by

71
00:04:28.681 --> 00:04:33.681
multiplying by Pi one pi two and at the end by Pi Ti.

72
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.590
Okay,
so that's,
that's step one.

73
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.880
But then step two we said was that once you've got these prices you can figure

74
00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:45.000
out the forwards.
So the forwards,

75
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.210
<v 1>okay</v>

76
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.210
<v 0>are going to be one plus it he so one plus it.</v>

77
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.690
That's by definition a the interest

78
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.040
<v 1>from tea</v>

79
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.210
<v 0>to t plus one that would be agreed today.</v>

80
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.213
<v 1>Okay.</v>

81
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.420
<v 0>He is not the interest rate that's going to prevail at time.</v>

82
00:05:17.421 --> 00:05:21.290
T it's the interest rate that people today at time zero would agree to pay

83
00:05:21.291 --> 00:05:23.480
between time t and time t plus one.

84
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.380
So that of course has to just equal pi ti over Pied t plus one because everybody

85
00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:35.450
today recognizes that the cost of a dollar time t his piety in the cost of a

86
00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:37.640
dollar at time.
T plus one is probably people's one.

87
00:05:37.641 --> 00:05:39.830
So the trade off between t and t plus one,

88
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.900
that's effectively what an interest rate does is a trades off money at one time

89
00:05:44.901 --> 00:05:46.850
for another time.
It has to be this ratio.

90
00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.470
So today people would agree on one plus it forward is the forward rate.

91
00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.770
Now you add to that the assumption that everybody is perfect is certain about

92
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.670
future assume uh,

93
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.310
a complete con assume perfect forecasting.

94
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.510
Hey,

95
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.990
so I don't have to actually assume that people are right in their forecasting.

96
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.950
I have to assume that there are completely sure of their forecasting,

97
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:15.440
so they're completely sure of their forecasting.

98
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.650
Then everybody must force see that.

99
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.970
They think they're sure that the future interest rate that will prevail at time.

100
00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:26.090
T is also equal to this number.
Okay.

101
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:30.860
So we can then write,
we write this price,

102
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.640
hello.

103
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.640
We can rewrite this price as one plus I zero word.

104
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.800
Okay.
That's uh,

105
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.870
instead of Pi to Pi two is just going to be one plus I zero forward times one

106
00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:51.680
plus I one forward.
Right.

107
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:56.681
And T and time Pi t is just going to be one plus zero forward times one.

108
00:06:59.571 --> 00:07:02.120
Plus I one forward dot,
dot,

109
00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:07.121
dot times one plus I t minus one forward.

110
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.030
Okay.
Because the,
you know,

111
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:18.060
using the fact that the eye one plus it is the prod is Pi t divided by Pi t plus

112
00:07:18.731 --> 00:07:21.250
one.
I just multiply,
you know,

113
00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:26.251
pie one divided by Pi two times Pi two divided by Pi zero et cetera.

114
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:32.590
Uh,
are a py one divided by I multiply,
uh,
you know,

115
00:07:32.591 --> 00:07:37.110
if I take Pi one divided by Pi zero times,
uh,

116
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.740
et Cetera,
uh,
I'm going to get exactly this formula.

117
00:07:41.741 --> 00:07:45.220
So Pi Zero,
okay.

118
00:07:45.221 --> 00:07:48.510
So I'm going to get exactly this formula so I can uh,

119
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.910
Pi zero is always one by the way.
So if I want to take Pi one,

120
00:07:53.911 --> 00:07:58.540
it's just going to be one over one plus eyes zero f if I want to take pie to,

121
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:03.310
I can always take a,
I can always do this high to,

122
00:08:03.311 --> 00:08:07.510
and so this is going to equal pie too.
So Pi two is going to be one over one.

123
00:08:07.511 --> 00:08:12.070
Plus I have zero times one over one plus I have won it Cetera.

124
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:17.130
Pi Three if I wanted to do pi three I just multiply it by Pi three over pie too.

125
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.680
And so that's equal to one of one plus I f zero times one of one plus one times

126
00:08:23.621 --> 00:08:26.920
one over one plus I have to.
So instead of multiplying by the pis,

127
00:08:26.921 --> 00:08:30.610
I might as well take the product of the forwards.
It's exactly the same thing.

128
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.810
Okay.
So the present value has this simple formula,

129
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.620
but this is a formula that holds at every time key if you,

130
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:43.190
if you're totally confident of your predictions of the seas and of the future at

131
00:08:43.191 --> 00:08:45.850
your interest rates or cause this is where we ended last time.

132
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.890
Basically with this formula,

133
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.600
the key that you had to use in the problem set was to realize if you're totally

134
00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:55.860
confident now about the future,

135
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.280
you have to be totally confident about doing this calculation in the future.

136
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:04.200
So PV one is going to be basically the same calculation,

137
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.690
but just so what's going to happen at time one,

138
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:09.360
after you've gone down one year,

139
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.150
you finished with this interest rate and you're looking at everything,
um,

140
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.260
one year later.
So I might as well write the PV one here.

141
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.820
Okay,
that's going to equal c two let's put it a little bit lower.

142
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:29.750
PV One is going to equal the same c two as before,

143
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.040
but now you're a year later.

144
00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:37.041
So it's just going to be one plus I f one k plus.

145
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:42.960
See if t and I,
I don't mean the one plus I have zero anymore.

146
00:09:42.961 --> 00:09:47.961
One plus I f one times one plus I f t minus one.

147
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:52.561
Okay,

148
00:09:52.561 --> 00:09:57.561
so it's exactly the same formula one year later and one year later you no longer

149
00:09:57.961 --> 00:10:00.630
have to worry about the interest rate that time already passed.

150
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.510
So you just drop this at every time and you write the same formula.

151
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.980
Of course you drop see one because that's all finished.

152
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:12.750
So the price at time one is just what's left except you've chopped off the one

153
00:10:12.751 --> 00:10:14.280
plus I am zero everywhere.

154
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.260
Okay,
so to write that the same way.

155
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.940
So P v zero,
I can write it the same way.
Equals

156
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:32.810
Pv zero equals what is going to equal the interest payment.

157
00:10:32.811 --> 00:10:35.870
You get see one,
not the interest of the dividend.
You get the cash flow,

158
00:10:35.871 --> 00:10:40.871
you get plus P v one

159
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:47.480
divided by one plus f zero

160
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.600
so why is that?
So this is a very important formula.
So why,
why is that?

161
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:59.610
Well,
it's approved by formula,

162
00:10:59.611 --> 00:11:03.650
but another way of saying it is that right?
You know,
Pv zero when you,

163
00:11:03.651 --> 00:11:07.700
when you get the acid at a time zero it gives you a cash flow at time one and

164
00:11:07.701 --> 00:11:11.060
then of course looked at from the point of view of time one you've got all the

165
00:11:11.061 --> 00:11:15.380
future cash flows,
but that's just what PV one is.
So basically the,
the,
the,

166
00:11:15.381 --> 00:11:19.700
the bond is going to give you a cash flow at time one and then the right to cash

167
00:11:19.701 --> 00:11:21.410
flows in the future.
But this right,

168
00:11:21.411 --> 00:11:24.470
the cash flows in the future at timeline is worth PV one.

169
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:28.400
So it's like you've got all this money at time one and so to get the value of

170
00:11:28.401 --> 00:11:31.070
times here,
you have to discount it back again.
Okay.

171
00:11:31.071 --> 00:11:35.600
So this is a very famous and important formula,

172
00:11:35.601 --> 00:11:38.480
which I want to pause a second and think about.
Yeah.

173
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:47.160
So there's a controversy today called marking to market.

174
00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.700
Okay.
Does anybody know what that controversy is about?

175
00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:02.760
What is marking to market mean?
Yup.

176
00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:15.403
<v 1>Right,</v>

177
00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.490
<v 0>right.
And,
okay,
so,</v>

178
00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.480
but you know that they've been relieved of this responsibility recently.

179
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.560
Well,
so they've been relieved of this responsibility lately.

180
00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:29.390
Now why have they been relieved of it?

181
00:12:29.391 --> 00:12:34.391
Because the thought was that the market was so panicked in the crisis that the

182
00:12:34.431 --> 00:12:37.880
price that they could fetch by selling their things really had nothing to do

183
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.670
with the value.
Okay.
But so let's,

184
00:12:40.671 --> 00:12:43.640
we're going to come back to whether that was a good idea that they,
you know,

185
00:12:43.641 --> 00:12:47.540
Congress passed under tremendous pressure.
Um,

186
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.970
what is the point of marking to market?

187
00:12:49.971 --> 00:12:53.600
So let's suppose that you really could anticipate the future and everybody was

188
00:12:53.601 --> 00:12:58.550
right about it.
The market price then would really be PV zero today.

189
00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.490
And it really wouldn't be PV one tomorrow.
Because if,

190
00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.760
if the interest rates to actually turn out to be what everybody expects and

191
00:13:04.761 --> 00:13:07.310
everybody's completely confident of their expectation,

192
00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:11.120
then as we saw the prices would have to be this today and this tomorrow.

193
00:13:11.121 --> 00:13:13.530
Otherwise there'd be an arbitrage.
You can make money for sure.

194
00:13:13.531 --> 00:13:17.840
I think you could make money for sure.
So if you're marketing to market,

195
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:22.730
what are you going to mark as the profits?
Are you going to say the profit,

196
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:27.380
uh,
at time one is,
so what is profit?
Let's just,

197
00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:31.910
if I had some room,
I'd put this somewhere.
How would you define,
um,

198
00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.140
how would you define profit?
I'll get rid of this.

199
00:13:36.141 --> 00:13:38.330
I think we've got this straight.

200
00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:48.733
<v 1>Okay.</v>

201
00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.240
<v 0>Okay.
So how would you define profit?</v>

202
00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:01.500
Time one what would you write?

203
00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.940
So let's say that this isn't a bond.
It's a,
an investment.

204
00:14:10.941 --> 00:14:12.710
You paid a bunch of money at time zero,

205
00:14:12.711 --> 00:14:17.711
maybe PV zero and in the future your investment is going to pay off some money.

206
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.250
You know,
maybe it was a project you invested in,
maybe you,
you know,

207
00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
you bought a bunch of stuff and you're selling it in the future and getting this

208
00:14:24.261 --> 00:14:27.890
money.
Maybe you bought a bond which is paying these coupons,
whatever it is.

209
00:14:27.891 --> 00:14:30.560
These are the cash flows of the project.
And now of course,

210
00:14:30.561 --> 00:14:32.720
your investors are very curious.
In year one,

211
00:14:32.721 --> 00:14:35.420
they want to know what profit is you have you made,
how are you doing?

212
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.240
So what's a number that you'd think of giving?

213
00:14:38.241 --> 00:14:40.520
What's the first number you'd think of telling them?
Yup.

214
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:42.970
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

215
00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:46.510
<v 0>Okay.
So you might think of saying c of one.</v>

216
00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:49.513
<v 1>Okay.</v>

217
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.180
<v 0>That's the cash you've,
so all these people could tell it.</v>

218
00:14:53.181 --> 00:14:55.970
Say you've gotten see of one that's your,
that's your revenue.

219
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.910
And I'm assuming this cashflow is net of expenses.

220
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:03.320
So you could say here's your revenue you got at timelines one c of one is that

221
00:15:03.321 --> 00:15:06.830
your profit?
If it were,
people would then look and they'd say,

222
00:15:06.831 --> 00:15:11.831
well we got profit of c of one and we put an investment in of p of v zero.

223
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.820
So is that the a rate of return?
Is that my rate of return?

224
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.093
<v 1>Yup.</v>

225
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:30.410
<v 0>Okay.
So,</v>

226
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.770
<v 1>okay.</v>

227
00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:35.090
<v 0>See you have won this exactly right.
I'm going to repeat what he said,</v>

228
00:15:35.091 --> 00:15:37.490
but I'm going to take longer to say it.
Um,

229
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:43.210
this idea of writing c of one over p of v zero is actually what many people try

230
00:15:44.301 --> 00:15:48.620
to say is their profit but is a bad number for for profit.

231
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:49.760
Now if you weren't,

232
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:54.110
if in period one you stopped marking to market and who had no idea,

233
00:15:54.111 --> 00:15:56.840
you didn't have to report this number,
Pv one,

234
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.480
I mean you didn't know what it was or you didn't have to report it,

235
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:03.470
what else could you report?
But see one over PV zero as the prophet.

236
00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:08.480
So marking to market you see is intimately connected to how you report profit.

237
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.820
So if you don't mark to market,
you don't know,

238
00:16:10.821 --> 00:16:13.850
you don't have to declare what the value of the assets are that are left.

239
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.970
All you would do when you declare when need to describe your profits as you'd

240
00:16:16.971 --> 00:16:19.790
say c one and people would of course in their heads,

241
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.190
in fact they wouldn't do it in their heads.
You tell them,
you know,

242
00:16:22.191 --> 00:16:24.860
our rate of return was see one over PV zero.

243
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:30.320
But why might that be a very misleading number?
Well,

244
00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:35.630
his point is it could well be that sea of one is a very high number.

245
00:16:35.631 --> 00:16:37.820
You've got a lot of cash flow this period.

246
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:43.300
But he said it may turn out that PV one is a terrible number.

247
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.640
So you s you know,
you may got a lot of cash flow,

248
00:16:46.641 --> 00:16:50.570
but there's nothing left going forward.
So,
uh,
he would,
he,

249
00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.060
he doesn't think that's a very good measure of profit.

250
00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:57.380
So he's suggesting why not report,
um,

251
00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.390
profit as c of one?

252
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:01.060
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

253
00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.570
<v 0>Plus P v one minus P v zero.</v>

254
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:07.920
<v 1>Okay.</v>

255
00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:12.360
<v 0>Now suppose you did that.
Um,
so he's saying,
look,</v>

256
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.280
you got a certain amount of cash,

257
00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:18.210
but the assets that you had also changed value and you ought to include that in

258
00:17:18.211 --> 00:17:22.950
your profit.
So what if you did that?
What would your rate of return B

259
00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:29.730
and Suppose Pv zero was NPV one recalculated as this and so you divided this by

260
00:17:29.731 --> 00:17:31.410
Pv zero,
what would that equal?

261
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.590
What,
what number would I get if I did that?

262
00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:02.300
I can't hear what
somebody speak up.

263
00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.060
Yes.
Okay.

264
00:18:08.061 --> 00:18:13.060
This would just be I f zero and you'd get the rate of return that you're

265
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:16.880
expecting to get.
Now why do I know that's I have zero cause I'll mow.

266
00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:20.060
I multiplied by Pv zero to this side.
Okay.

267
00:18:20.061 --> 00:18:22.820
Then I moved that Pv zero to the other side.

268
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.440
Might Cause we one plus I zero F P v zero.

269
00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:32.090
Then I divide by one plus I have zero and put it down here and that's this

270
00:18:32.091 --> 00:18:36.500
formula.
Okay,
so that is what you would get.

271
00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.530
I have zero and you see that's what you should expect to get.

272
00:18:39.531 --> 00:18:42.140
Cause you haven't done anything great.
You've got a cash flow,

273
00:18:42.141 --> 00:18:47.141
you've got these cash flows at the beginning you paid a fair price for them and

274
00:18:47.151 --> 00:18:51.650
next period everybody forecast that the values we're going to go to PV one and

275
00:18:51.651 --> 00:18:54.710
so it can't be that you're,
you know this was an investment you made,

276
00:18:54.711 --> 00:18:58.010
you put your money in,
you bought this bond,
you could sell the bond.

277
00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:01.230
Now at time one after having obtained the cashflows,

278
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.150
it better be that your rate of return is the market interest rate of return.

279
00:19:05.151 --> 00:19:08.000
Otherwise there'd be some arbitrage.
And in fact it is.

280
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:12.620
So if you can compute all the present values properly,

281
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:15.830
the only fair thing to do,
this is not a great investment.

282
00:19:15.831 --> 00:19:18.020
Even if c one is a huge amount of money,

283
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:22.460
it's only huge because PV one is a low amount of money because it has to be that

284
00:19:22.461 --> 00:19:23.720
the profit every period,

285
00:19:23.721 --> 00:19:27.650
the rate of profit is exactly equal to the interest rate because everything's

286
00:19:27.651 --> 00:19:31.970
always priced at its present value.
Okay?

287
00:19:31.971 --> 00:19:33.140
So it's a,

288
00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:38.570
a simple concept which somehow,

289
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.690
um,
takes a long time to grasp.

290
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:46.670
It just seems to people that,
you know,
here's the money that's coming in.

291
00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.580
That's the cash you can count in your hands.
You've got it in your hands.

292
00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.520
That's the number you should talk about is profit.
But of course,

293
00:19:52.521 --> 00:19:56.060
if the money coming into your hands,
you know,
there's this other hidden thing,

294
00:19:56.061 --> 00:19:59.720
the stuff that you own is suddenly fallen in value compared to what it was

295
00:19:59.721 --> 00:20:00.470
before.

296
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:03.710
You're really not putting the firm in any better position than it was before.

297
00:20:03.711 --> 00:20:06.200
You just earned your normal rate of return.

298
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:11.510
So it may well be that.
Um,
so it's,

299
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:16.040
you can see why to give a fair description of how people are doing.

300
00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.750
The law was written,

301
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:22.040
evolved to the point where people were forced not to just say c of one.

302
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:26.480
They are forced to declare mark to market and add PV,

303
00:20:26.481 --> 00:20:31.481
one minus PV zero to their profit to get a real rate of return to get an action

304
00:20:31.791 --> 00:20:35.540
to get a,
a,
a more um,
revealing rate of return.

305
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.861
Okay.

306
00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:40.940
And so what happened in the crisis is this PV one became such a horribly low

307
00:20:40.941 --> 00:20:45.610
number that if you plug that in to this formula,
you'd get PV.
One is a,

308
00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:49.480
is a really low number compared PV zero,
you get a giant negative here.

309
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:53.410
It would look like the rate of return,
the rate of,
you know,
return was terrible.

310
00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.500
Everyone would panic and think the firms had fallen apart.

311
00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.640
So especially the banks who are the ones who didn't want to do this.

312
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:05.740
And so congress didn't want the public to be panicked.
So it's simply said,
okay,

313
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:06.663
forget about it.

314
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.900
We're going to not hold you to writing PV one anymore because you know,

315
00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:12.730
we can't count anybody.
Figuring out what it is.

316
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.270
And so you don't have to tell us that.
You just have to tell us this,

317
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:18.280
which happens to be a good number for the banks.

318
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.550
But that doesn't mean the banks are actually doing well because the assets they

319
00:21:21.551 --> 00:21:24.010
hold had been collapsing and value.
Yeah.

320
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:36.570
Yes.
Right.
It's what exactly what it says and that's what does happen.

321
00:21:36.571 --> 00:21:39.780
So you always talking about the price x dividend and stuff like that.

322
00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:44.310
Precisely that.
So if a firm pays a bigger than usual dividends,
if a gigantic,

323
00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:47.940
if it's suddenly decides it's going to pay itself a gigantic dividend,

324
00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:52.110
then the price of the firm is going to go down.
Exactly.

325
00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:53.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

326
00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.490
<v 0>Because there's less value in the firm.</v>

327
00:21:55.491 --> 00:21:58.310
You've paid it out here instead of keeping it into the firm.
Okay.

328
00:21:58.311 --> 00:22:01.400
So this is a very simple idea,
but it's very easy to get confused about it.

329
00:22:01.401 --> 00:22:05.430
Are there any questions about it?
Okay,

330
00:22:05.431 --> 00:22:07.350
so let's do an example of it.

331
00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:12.090
The most basic example of it is the premium,
the premium bond.

332
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.230
We talked about this before,
the premium bonds.

333
00:22:16.231 --> 00:22:21.231
So let's say you have PV zero equals no five divided by one plus 10 plus five

334
00:22:25.681 --> 00:22:30.240
divided by one plus 10 plus.
Maybe this was exactly the problem set.

335
00:22:30.241 --> 00:22:34.080
I can't remember.
Five divided by one plus 10.
Okay,
so in other words,

336
00:22:34.081 --> 00:22:38.250
the interest rate,
I did that wrong.
Squared and t,

337
00:22:38.251 --> 00:22:41.970
so the interest rate,
so the forwards,
in other words,

338
00:22:41.971 --> 00:22:46.971
one plus I f little t equals one plus 10 for all tea.

339
00:22:48.361 --> 00:22:51.840
So all the Fords or 10% the bond is paying.

340
00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.620
I can't remember which one I did.
Let's,
let's do the,
uh,

341
00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:59.190
let's do 20 here and then make it a premium bond.
So it's paying 20.

342
00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:07.310
Okay.
So what's going to be the,
the,

343
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:09.920
the price of the bond?
Well,

344
00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:13.280
in the first period it looks like you get this incredible profit.

345
00:23:13.281 --> 00:23:18.281
The interest rate is 10% you've paid some present value and you've made 20.

346
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:22.660
You've made a number much bigger.
So the price of this thing,
by the way,
did it,

347
00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.100
what was the homework problem?
What was,
what were the numbers?

348
00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:26.260
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

349
00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.310
<v 0>what was the interest rate?</v>

350
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.053
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

351
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:34.740
<v 0>Did somebody do the homework?
I did assign a homework on a premium bond.
Right?</v>

352
00:23:34.741 --> 00:23:38.490
What were the interest rate was 5% and the coupon was 10 was that what it was?
Or

353
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:42.570
<v 1>what?
What was it?</v>

354
00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:50.260
<v 0>What was the homework problem?
Eight and six.
Okay,</v>

355
00:23:50.261 --> 00:23:55.180
so this was 8% might as well do this one.
You can t six here?
Yup.

356
00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:59.070
6%
okay.

357
00:23:59.071 --> 00:24:01.260
And this one was a hundred was eight.

358
00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.760
Okay.
So what was the price?
PV Zero.

359
00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:09.570
What was Pv zero

360
00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.050
you've done this homework problem,
right?

361
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:16.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

362
00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.220
<v 0>Does anyone remember what number they got?</v>

363
00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:28.090
Ben,
do you remember the number right?

364
00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:29.503
<v 1>No,</v>

365
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.420
<v 0>I'm counting on my trusty class here to provide me all the numbers yet.</v>

366
00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:40.893
<v 1>It was,
what</v>

367
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.430
<v 0>was that?
What?
It was one oh 8.4 that's all</v>

368
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:52.240
this was the price.
Just one to 8.4
okay.

369
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:57.400
Um,
okay,

370
00:24:57.401 --> 00:25:01.870
so one oh 8.4 right?
It's okay.
That's all high price.
So it's way above par.

371
00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.140
This is a Ron that's worth much more than a hundred.
Why?

372
00:25:05.141 --> 00:25:08.740
Because the interest rate is 6% but the coupon is eight so this is called a

373
00:25:08.741 --> 00:25:12.160
premium bond.
So if you look at the first year,

374
00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:17.280
the rate of return on the first year is eight over 108.4 now is that,

375
00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:19.293
um,

376
00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:24.420
more than 6% it's way more than 6% eight over 108.4 is,

377
00:25:25.151 --> 00:25:28.690
you know,
seven.
Uh,
that's,
you know,
it's,
it's,

378
00:25:28.691 --> 00:25:32.950
it's way more than a 6% cause 7% of this is going to be,

379
00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:34.990
<v 1>um,
you know,</v>

380
00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:38.530
<v 0>7% of this is going to be less the next,</v>

381
00:25:38.531 --> 00:25:43.120
so it's more than 7% so this is greater than 7%.
Okay.

382
00:25:43.121 --> 00:25:45.790
And so it's bigger,
it's certainly bigger than 6%.

383
00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:51.310
So it sure looks like at the end of the first year,
like this bond was in a spot.

384
00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:55.090
That's the kind of calls that you use to get,
you still sometimes do get them,

385
00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:56.320
you know,
if a,

386
00:25:56.321 --> 00:25:59.440
if you're a wealthy person and you actually answered calls like this,

387
00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:00.670
which you don't of course,

388
00:26:00.671 --> 00:26:03.340
but you can get some cold call from a salesperson saying,

389
00:26:03.341 --> 00:26:06.550
we've got to fund and look how well it's doing on this much investment.

390
00:26:06.551 --> 00:26:11.551
Last year we got payments of $8 that's more than 7% and you look,

391
00:26:11.831 --> 00:26:15.910
everybody can see the interest rate's only 6% we did better than 7% we're doing

392
00:26:15.911 --> 00:26:18.940
great.
Why don't you invest in our fund?
But actually what the,

393
00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:23.970
what the salesman hasn't told you is that the value of his assets has gone down.

394
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:25.421
Okay?

395
00:26:25.421 --> 00:26:30.370
So the present value of Pv one must be less than PV zero.

396
00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:35.460
Because we know from this formula that hold the form of the right up here,

397
00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:40.330
that 6% is going to be the cash flow over PV zero,

398
00:26:40.331 --> 00:26:44.250
which is more than 7% plus this difference and this difference,

399
00:26:44.251 --> 00:26:45.780
therefore it's going to have to be negative.

400
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:50.700
So what he didn't tell you was that the fund lost value even though the first

401
00:26:50.701 --> 00:26:55.500
payment was better than 6% the market rate of interest.
Okay?

402
00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:59.910
So that's the uh,
okay.
So that's the first example.

403
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:02.850
Now let's um,

404
00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.660
let's do another example.

405
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:11.580
Suppose you have a,
uh,

406
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.580
suppose you can see if I can write on this board.

407
00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.760
So there's a famous trade called the carry trade.

408
00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.010
Now suppose the forwards,

409
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:33.310
suppose one plus I f zero is 2% sort of like now the one year yield and one plus

410
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:40.940
I f t is you know,

411
00:27:40.941 --> 00:27:43.820
5% for t greater than one.

412
00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:51.290
Okay.
So if you have a one year bond,
it's going to pay,
well.

413
00:27:51.291 --> 00:27:54.650
Let's say it's 2% and this is equal to one plus.

414
00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:58.980
Can you see this or it's this appearing.
So let's make the first,
uh,

415
00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:03.770
to have them be 2% and this is for t greater than or equal to three.

416
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:08.420
Okay,
so the interest rate is 2% and then it's going to jump to 5%.

417
00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:12.380
All right?
So if you have a two year bond,

418
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:17.810
a two year treasury at two year bond might pay,

419
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:22.550
um,

420
00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:27.880
two and 102 and the present value of this equals a hundred

421
00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.020
present value of the two year bond.

422
00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:37.311
Okay.

423
00:28:37.311 --> 00:28:42.311
But now maybe you've got a longer bond that's a five year bond,

424
00:28:42.681 --> 00:28:46.940
which pays coupons,
you know,
a four,

425
00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:50.810
four,
four,
four,
104

426
00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:54.670
this is a five year mine.

427
00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:01.350
Okay.
And maybe it's price is close to a hundred actually,

428
00:29:01.351 --> 00:29:03.570
I haven't worked out the numbers.
So you're going to have to do that.

429
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:08.850
The next problem set.
So is it possible,
so I'll ask it this way,

430
00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:13.860
is it possible for this coupon to be higher four,
four,
four,

431
00:29:13.861 --> 00:29:18.330
four,
four and yet still have a present value of 100 then this one,

432
00:29:18.331 --> 00:29:20.310
which is two in a hundred to,

433
00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:24.810
could you have a higher coupon and yet the same present value of a hundred on a

434
00:29:24.811 --> 00:29:26.610
longer bond than on a shorter bond.

435
00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.193
<v 1>Okay.</v>

436
00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:36.760
<v 0>How could this bond have a higher coupon and still for the same price as this</v>

437
00:29:38.211 --> 00:29:41.740
bond?
Yup.

438
00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.900
<v 1>You're losing money on the assets.</v>

439
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:48.170
You've been principal value people to get it in a later period.

440
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:54.030
<v 0>Okay,
so the point is you're discounting the first two payments by 2% a year,</v>

441
00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:57.510
but you're discounting these payments by 5% a year.

442
00:29:57.511 --> 00:30:00.030
So these things are going to be much worse than they look.

443
00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.780
And so even though the fours are all better,
this hundred you know,
it's four,

444
00:30:03.781 --> 00:30:08.280
four,
four,
four,
four plus a hundred that hundred not to mention,

445
00:30:08.281 --> 00:30:11.040
these three last fours are getting discounted by a lot.

446
00:30:11.041 --> 00:30:16.020
So that hundred four is going to be worth less than a hundred back back.

447
00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.900
You know it's going to be worth less.
Okay.

448
00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.940
So that's why these things are going to go down a lot more than you'd think

449
00:30:20.941 --> 00:30:23.460
they're going to be worth less than a hundred so even those,

450
00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.420
even the least things are better than the 2% rate of this bond is great at the

451
00:30:27.421 --> 00:30:30.330
beginning.
But those poorly thereafter,
because at the beginning it's paying,

452
00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:30.780
you know,

453
00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:34.950
4% when the interest rate is 2% but later it's paying for is when the interest

454
00:30:34.951 --> 00:30:39.510
rate is 5% so clearly you could have some situation like that.

455
00:30:39.511 --> 00:30:41.040
So what's the carry trade?

456
00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:46.170
The carry trade is you buy the long bond.

457
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:49.180
<v 1>Okay.</v>

458
00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.190
<v 0>And sell short.</v>

459
00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:54.810
<v 1>That's
the short bond.</v>

460
00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:58.973
So the,

461
00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:04.610
<v 0>they'll let the uh,
the lower maturity,</v>

462
00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:07.160
too many shorts,
the lower maturity

463
00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:09.373
<v 1>mine.</v>

464
00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:16.160
<v 0>Okay.
This is the,
this is the,
you know,</v>

465
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:19.280
let's say five year and two year by the five year.

466
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.450
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

467
00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:23.840
<v 0>I five year bond and sell short the two year.</v>

468
00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.413
<v 1>Okay.</v>

469
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:29.220
<v 0>Can you selling short and short?</v>

470
00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.690
The word sell short is different from the word short bonds.

471
00:31:32.691 --> 00:31:36.840
So you buy the five year bond and you sell the short,
the two year bond,

472
00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:40.080
they both cost you a hundred so what's happening at the beginning?

473
00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:44.820
You're making $4 and you're only having to pay $2 it looks like you're making a

474
00:31:44.821 --> 00:31:49.440
profit for nothing,
right?
So that's the carry trade.

475
00:31:49.441 --> 00:31:51.570
You buy long bonds with a high rate of interest.

476
00:31:51.571 --> 00:31:55.890
You sell short bonds with low coupons and it looks like you're making a profit.

477
00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:00.270
But in fact,
what's really happening?
So just repeat what you were saying before,

478
00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.760
but now in this context,
what's really happening?

479
00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:23.640
Right?
So the long bond,

480
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:28.670
you got a cashflow of for the first year you had to pay too because you sold the

481
00:32:29.161 --> 00:32:30.990
two years short,
right?

482
00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:35.880
So you're up $2 but the thing that you owe now at the end of the first year,

483
00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:40.730
since the interest rate is 2% the next interest rate is 2% the two year bond is

484
00:32:40.731 --> 00:32:42.800
still worth a hundred so your net,

485
00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:47.180
your negative position is still worth a hundred but this positive possession now

486
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:48.710
these four forest and forest,

487
00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.890
it looks worse than it did before because you've moved up the yield curve.

488
00:32:51.891 --> 00:32:54.110
Instead of having to 2% years,

489
00:32:54.111 --> 00:32:58.940
you only got one 2% year before you shift into the five percent's which is worse

490
00:32:58.941 --> 00:32:59.750
and worse.

491
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:03.260
So what's going to happen is you're going to get a positive cash flow at the

492
00:33:03.261 --> 00:33:07.940
beginning.
It looks like positive profits right at the beginning.
Okay?

493
00:33:07.941 --> 00:33:11.600
That c one is,
you know,
the net,
see one,
it looks really good,

494
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:16.750
but right after that the value of your assets is going to plummet compared to

495
00:33:18.021 --> 00:33:22.250
your liabilities because now all of a sudden you're discounting this at 5% and

496
00:33:22.251 --> 00:33:24.020
this thing is still,
you know,

497
00:33:24.021 --> 00:33:26.930
it's only got one year left where the interest rate is still 2% and the rest of

498
00:33:26.931 --> 00:33:31.520
this is discounted at 5% so starting to go down in value.
Okay.

499
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:36.860
So all right,
so what,

500
00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:42.380
um,
so if you didn't have to mark to market,

501
00:33:42.381 --> 00:33:43.280
what would you do

502
00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:50.160
if you didn't have to declare to the world what your present value of your

503
00:33:50.161 --> 00:33:53.760
remaining assets are?
Cause you could say,
oh,
it's so hard to figure out,

504
00:33:53.761 --> 00:33:56.760
I don't know what the stuff is worth the present value of what's going forward.

505
00:33:56.761 --> 00:33:57.510
I just know,
you know,

506
00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:01.110
the cash that's coming in this carry trade would look like a really good trade,

507
00:34:01.111 --> 00:34:04.830
wasn't it?
And a lot of people would do it because then they would look,

508
00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:05.580
they could,

509
00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:08.070
the public would think that they're doing really well because they're getting

510
00:34:08.071 --> 00:34:11.760
positive value.
But in the future,
if that's positive value they're getting,

511
00:34:11.761 --> 00:34:15.570
it's just disguising losses that are happening in their portfolios going
forward.

512
00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.130
So any questions about that?

513
00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.900
<v 1>Yeah.
Okay.</v>

514
00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.030
<v 0>So I want you to explain it.</v>

515
00:34:26.031 --> 00:34:28.830
So you see that if this side didn't calculate the numbers,

516
00:34:28.831 --> 00:34:32.840
it would've been better to do actual numbers.
Uh,
if we do four,
four,

517
00:34:32.841 --> 00:34:37.660
four at 5% interest,
or maybe I can do a,
uh,

518
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:42.470
let's just do a real number.
Well,
let's just do the one over here.

519
00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:47.270
So this one is,
um,
uh,
no,

520
00:34:47.271 --> 00:34:49.880
I can't do it because we got 2% and then 4% okay.

521
00:34:49.881 --> 00:34:51.530
So it take a minute to do it on excel.

522
00:34:51.531 --> 00:34:53.960
And you've seen how great I am doing those on the fly.

523
00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:59.140
So the point is that you agree that this payment for is bigger than two.

524
00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:04.760
Okay?
So the first year,
if you buy this bond and you sell that bond,

525
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:09.890
you're going to have a positive net $2.
However,

526
00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:14.600
it's perfectly possible for this whole bond at the beginning to be worth a

527
00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:19.460
hundred the same as this bond at the beginning.
Now how could that be?
Well,

528
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.980
the payments for is bigger than two.

529
00:35:21.981 --> 00:35:26.840
So how could this whole thing have a higher present value than this thing?

530
00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.510
It has to be that starting at period one,

531
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:33.920
the present value of this five year bond,
let's call it this.
Okay.

532
00:35:33.921 --> 00:35:38.921
And period one minus the present value of the two year bond starting in period

533
00:35:39.661 --> 00:35:40.740
one has to be what?

534
00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:44.320
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

535
00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:48.130
<v 0>If this whole thing,
if this present value of the five year bond,</v>

536
00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:53.280
this is the five year bond at times zero equals a hundred and that's exactly the

537
00:35:53.381 --> 00:35:58.381
same as this present value at times zero of the two year bond that equals a

538
00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:04.330
hundred so the present value from the beginning of this thing is the same as the

539
00:36:04.331 --> 00:36:06.280
present value of this thing from the beginning.

540
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:09.010
How could this thing have value a hundred well,

541
00:36:09.011 --> 00:36:11.710
it's because it makes lots of high coupon payments,

542
00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:15.340
but the interest rate is going to jump up in the future to 5% so you're

543
00:36:15.341 --> 00:36:18.250
discounting all these future clash falls at a big number.

544
00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:21.820
So all these things present valued could well equal 100

545
00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:23.290
<v 1>okay,</v>

546
00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:24.730
<v 0>so this could be a hundred in this.</v>

547
00:36:24.731 --> 00:36:28.120
Could be a hundred even though this is paying off more at the beginning.

548
00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:30.440
Then this thing is okay,

549
00:36:30.441 --> 00:36:33.500
but then what does that form now that we just wrote down over there,

550
00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:38.470
what is this formula?
Tell us where was this formula that I wrote down?

551
00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:46.320
This formula over here tells us if the present values of two instruments,

552
00:36:46.481 --> 00:36:50.770
I see,
I'd wrote it for one bond,
but if you take two bonds,
okay,

553
00:36:50.771 --> 00:36:52.210
with the same present value,

554
00:36:52.211 --> 00:36:55.930
one of which has a higher cash flow in the first period than the other.

555
00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:59.650
Then that form on your tells you the bond with the higher cashflow at the

556
00:36:59.651 --> 00:37:04.210
beginning has to have a bigger drop and the present value than the other bond.

557
00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:09.240
Otherwise you can't get them both equal to the same hundred so this bond and

558
00:37:10.151 --> 00:37:13.780
this bond have the same present value of a hundred because this payment is

559
00:37:13.781 --> 00:37:16.360
bigger than this payment,
but the present values are the same.

560
00:37:16.361 --> 00:37:21.220
100 it has to be that starting from this point on this bond is worth less than

561
00:37:21.221 --> 00:37:26.200
that bond.
So what happened you,
you go long this bond,
you short that bond.

562
00:37:26.201 --> 00:37:29.500
You say to the world,
the Ha,
I've made $2,
I'm a genius.

563
00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.740
And then you hide from them.
You might hide from them.

564
00:37:32.741 --> 00:37:33.760
He didn't have to tell them,

565
00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.370
they wouldn't know that the present value of the bond,

566
00:37:36.371 --> 00:37:41.371
you're long going forward is actually lower by $2 from the present value going

567
00:37:41.531 --> 00:37:44.140
forward of the,
this is right after this period.

568
00:37:44.141 --> 00:37:48.370
The present value starting at this point of this bond going forward has actually

569
00:37:48.371 --> 00:37:52.450
dropped $2 below the present value of this bond going forward

570
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:56.750
and it has to have dropped cause otherwise the present values wouldn't be the

571
00:37:56.751 --> 00:38:00.470
same.
Okay,
so it's as you say it much more simply.

572
00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:03.290
If you take two bonds with the same present value,

573
00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:07.040
you could well have that situation where they have the same present value

574
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:11.240
because one of the bonds pays a lot of stuff early and terrible stuff late.

575
00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.051
It's okay.

576
00:38:12.051 --> 00:38:15.110
So in the beginning it looks like this bond is paying you more money than the

577
00:38:15.111 --> 00:38:17.300
other bond,
but since they had the same present value,

578
00:38:17.301 --> 00:38:20.810
it must mean that this bond is going to pay you more money at the tail.

579
00:38:20.811 --> 00:38:23.600
Then this bond is,
that's why they had the same present value.

580
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:26.600
So if one of them gets ahead at the beginning,
it has to be,

581
00:38:26.601 --> 00:38:28.820
it's going to fall behind the rest of the time.

582
00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:30.530
So this one got ahead at the beginning.

583
00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.480
It has to fall behind the rest of the time.

584
00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:36.040
That's hard to see because it looks this bond,

585
00:38:36.041 --> 00:38:39.810
you know it's paying a coupon that's always bigger than that bond.
So you,
you,

586
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:42.680
you look,
it's easy to lose track of the fact that this bond,

587
00:38:42.681 --> 00:38:45.040
because it's coupon is higher than this bond.

588
00:38:45.041 --> 00:38:48.220
How could it possibly ever fall below this bond?
Well,

589
00:38:48.221 --> 00:38:53.221
it falls below because it's longer and the cash flows towards the end of it are

590
00:38:53.951 --> 00:38:57.100
being discounted by an interest rate because everybody knows the interest rate's

591
00:38:57.101 --> 00:39:00.830
going to go up.
Okay.

592
00:39:00.831 --> 00:39:04.370
And remember we saw last time the yield curve,
the yield curve.

593
00:39:04.371 --> 00:39:06.680
Remember today's yield curve,
you know,

594
00:39:06.681 --> 00:39:09.310
is practically zero now because the government's held at zero,

595
00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:13.670
it's going to go way up to 4% or something,
you know,
in a couple of years.

596
00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:17.510
Okay.
So that's the yield curve today.

597
00:39:17.511 --> 00:39:20.150
So everybody knows the interest rates are really low now and again,

598
00:39:20.151 --> 00:39:21.470
you get much higher leader.

599
00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:25.790
So what it means is that every long bond that's being issued now is going to be

600
00:39:25.791 --> 00:39:28.100
issued with a higher coupon than the short bonds.

601
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:31.070
And if you go long the long bond and short the short bond,

602
00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:33.800
you're going to make money at the beginning,
but lose it back later.

603
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:36.740
But if you don't have to report mark to market,

604
00:39:36.741 --> 00:39:38.960
you don't have to say the value of what's left over.

605
00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:41.720
The public's just going to see that you're making money at the beginning.

606
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:46.730
It's clear now.
Okay.
Any other questions about this?

607
00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:49.430
So this is a lot of this is going on right now.

608
00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:51.533
<v 1>MMM.</v>

609
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:57.850
<v 0>Okay.
So let's do one more application of this.
Let's try,</v>

610
00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:03.070
let's explain how mortgages work.
One more,
uh,
idea.
Okay.

611
00:40:03.071 --> 00:40:03.904
Since,

612
00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:11.290
since the present value is equal to the cash flow plus the present value at one

613
00:40:12.051 --> 00:40:16.910
times that given this formula,
that tells you one more thing.
Very important idea.

614
00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:20.240
How do you compute,
present value zero.
Well,

615
00:40:20.241 --> 00:40:24.710
the way we've always computed present value at zero is to do this calculation,

616
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:28.220
this long calculation discounting all the future cash flows.

617
00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:32.900
But this formula tells you that there's actually a more efficient way of

618
00:40:32.901 --> 00:40:35.330
calculating it by backward induction.

619
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:38.660
If I knew what the present value was a time one,

620
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:43.280
then I could get the present value at time zero just by this formula.

621
00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:46.730
I'd add the present value of time one to the cash at time one and discounted.

622
00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:51.110
So in fact,
I don't have to.
Now,
I don't know the present value at time one,

623
00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:54.290
but if I go to the end,
you know,
at the end of the time,

624
00:40:54.291 --> 00:40:56.060
I know the present value of the bond is zero.

625
00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.130
There's nothing coming up later at time.

626
00:40:58.131 --> 00:41:01.790
T minus one I know the present value is very easy to calculate.

627
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:06.230
It's CFT divided by one plus cy,
F t minus one.

628
00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:11.150
So I can go backwards.
By present value and Compute,

629
00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:15.410
I can do backward induction.
So that's the word I want to describe,

630
00:41:15.411 --> 00:41:20.160
which is going to play a very important role in the future class.

631
00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:23.930
Backward induction.
It says,
if this formula's correct,

632
00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:29.150
then a good way to do the computation is by working backwards from the end.

633
00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:33.140
Don't just blindly take the present value.
If you blindly take the present,

634
00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:37.790
all you've got is PV zero.
If I calculate by backward induction,

635
00:41:37.791 --> 00:41:41.090
I start to the end and say,
what would PV t minus one bead?

636
00:41:41.091 --> 00:41:42.320
That's a really simple thing.

637
00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:46.160
Then I can very simply find out what PV t minus two is,
et cetera.

638
00:41:46.161 --> 00:41:47.120
Back to the beginning.

639
00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:51.860
I do basically the same calculations without having to take powers of a,

640
00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:57.170
it's a shorter calculation because here I've got exponents of,
of uh,
of,
uh,

641
00:41:57.171 --> 00:41:59.660
you know,
of interest rates multiplying each other.

642
00:41:59.661 --> 00:42:02.330
So it's actually a shorter calculation.
And on top of that,

643
00:42:02.331 --> 00:42:04.190
I get much more information cause now I've,

644
00:42:04.191 --> 00:42:07.790
I've calculated out what the present value is going to be at every time period.

645
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:12.380
So much more efficient way of calculating things is to do by backward induction

646
00:42:12.381 --> 00:42:15.980
because it also tells me more.
It tells me what the future path of a,

647
00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:20.500
of the bond is going to be.
So let's just see how that works.

648
00:42:20.501 --> 00:42:24.250
And an example that I hope I worked out properly before,

649
00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:28.300
whereas I did it last year.
But what's,
I assume I did it right.
So

650
00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:32.800
let's take a mortgage if you can see this.

651
00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:36.670
So this is something you have in your notes.
So there's,
there's a mortgage.

652
00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:37.900
Now how does a

653
00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:40.453
<v 1>uh,</v>

654
00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:48.250
<v 0>all right,
well pay no attention to that.
So let's just say that.</v>

655
00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:52.580
Um,
oh no.
Why did this happen?
Um,

656
00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:55.460
let's say that the payment is,

657
00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:57.770
<v 1>uh,
eight.</v>

658
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:05.203
Yeah.

659
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:09.960
<v 0>And uh,
eight.
Okay,</v>

660
00:43:09.961 --> 00:43:14.640
so I've made payments of eight everywhere.
Okay,
so this is so here.
So I,

661
00:43:14.641 --> 00:43:17.130
I hope I haven't screwed though.
So here's the mortgage.
It's,
it's,

662
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:21.990
it's a 30 year mortgage.
So these are the years,
one,
two,
three,
four,

663
00:43:21.991 --> 00:43:25.950
five,
six,
seven,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
up to year 30.

664
00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:27.240
Okay.

665
00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:32.240
Now suppose I happen to have a bond that pays a coupon of $8 every year.

666
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:37.110
Okay.
And the interest rate,
let's say a 7%.

667
00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:40.170
So it'd be the interest rate on the mortgage.
But let's say the interest rate,

668
00:43:40.171 --> 00:43:43.380
the economy is 7% and the bond however,

669
00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:48.410
is a premium bond or the bond is paying 8% every year.

670
00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.780
Now this is a mortgage,
not a,

671
00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:55.840
<v 1>okay.</v>

672
00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:00.160
<v 0>Uh,
this is a mortgage.
So what does this mean?</v>

673
00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.393
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

674
00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:10.020
<v 0>See,
the mortgage pays eight every year until the very last year where it's still</v>

675
00:44:10.021 --> 00:44:14.610
paying eight.
Okay.
So it's not paying 108 is just paying eight every year.

676
00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:17.040
So it's not a coupon bond.
It's a mortgage.

677
00:44:17.041 --> 00:44:19.920
A mortgage pays the same amount every year until the end.

678
00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:24.390
So if this were a coupon bond,
the last payment would be 108.

679
00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:27.690
And of course the thing would be a tremendous,
uh,

680
00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:31.440
it would be a premium bond because the interest rates only seven cause it would

681
00:44:31.441 --> 00:44:33.870
pay a higher coupon of eight and 108 at the end.

682
00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:38.040
But you'll see I'm not paying 108 at the end.
I'm only paying eight at the end.

683
00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:43.170
So the question is,
the first question is,
what is the,
um,

684
00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:45.720
you know,
what is the present value of this bond?

685
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:50.550
So I could take eight divided by 1.07 plus eight divided by one point over seven

686
00:44:50.551 --> 00:44:54.990
squared plus all the way eight over one players Oh seven to the 30th power and

687
00:44:54.991 --> 00:44:55.950
figure out that number.

688
00:44:56.190 --> 00:45:00.030
But a much better way of doing it is by backward induction.
So what do I do?

689
00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:04.770
I go to the end and I save this line is the,
is the remaining balance?

690
00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:08.760
Well,
at year 30 there'd be no more payments of the bond.

691
00:45:08.761 --> 00:45:13.350
So what's left?
The present value of what's left is obviously zero.
Now,

692
00:45:13.351 --> 00:45:18.030
what is the present value of what's left at time 29?

693
00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:18.421
Well,

694
00:45:18.421 --> 00:45:22.590
the only thing I'm going to get is I'm going to get this payment at time eight

695
00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:25.570
right over there.
All right,

696
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:28.080
I'm going to get this eight right there.

697
00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:32.640
And so the present value of eight at 7% interest,
you know,
is one,

698
00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:37.320
is 7.47 I mean 7% interest.
Okay?
So,

699
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.180
uh,
how did I figure that out?

700
00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:44.210
I just said take that payment on the right and discounted by 7% so it's 7.47

701
00:45:44.701 --> 00:45:46.410
now,
what's the present value here?

702
00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:50.790
We'll here you're going to get two things.
What are you going to get?

703
00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:53.160
You're going to get a coupon paint,
so when you're at the end,

704
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:57.600
just after the payment in year 28 what's the present value of what's left?

705
00:45:57.601 --> 00:46:02.601
You're going to get a payment in year 29 of $8 you're also going to get one in

706
00:46:03.631 --> 00:46:06.000
year 30 but you don't care about that.

707
00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:09.570
You just know that the value in year 29 is the payment,

708
00:46:09.571 --> 00:46:14.571
the coupon you get in year 29 plus the present value in year 29 of what's left.

709
00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:19.800
The PV at time t,
I can just put a t here,
Pv at time.

710
00:46:19.801 --> 00:46:22.110
T is the coupon you get at time.

711
00:46:22.111 --> 00:46:26.310
T plus one plus the present value at time.

712
00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:31.850
T plus one divided by the interest rate at time t.

713
00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:33.931
Okay.

714
00:46:33.931 --> 00:46:38.931
So all I have to do is take eight plus 7.47 and discount that by 7% and that

715
00:46:40.801 --> 00:46:44.770
gives me the present value as of time.
Uh,

716
00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:48.780
28 so if I go back to time 26 I say,

717
00:46:48.781 --> 00:46:53.781
well how do I figure out the present value at time 27 I as time 27 I say,

718
00:46:54.031 --> 00:46:56.370
well,
I'm going to get eight at time,

719
00:46:56.371 --> 00:47:00.330
28 but the present value at that time,
just after I've made that,

720
00:47:00.331 --> 00:47:05.331
after that payment is 14.4 so I take 22.4 and discounted by 7% and I get about

721
00:47:06.391 --> 00:47:07.830
21 okay.

722
00:47:07.831 --> 00:47:11.940
So that's how I can work backwards and figure out the present value today.

723
00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:15.420
Now in mortgages,
this number is very interesting.

724
00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:20.370
It's called the remaining balance.
Okay.
Which we'll see in a second.
But anyway,

725
00:47:20.371 --> 00:47:24.270
that number you can calculate it every t it's just the PVT worked backwards from

726
00:47:24.271 --> 00:47:24.960
the end.

727
00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:29.860
So it's a very simple calculation and it tells you the present value of the

728
00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:31.600
bond.
Okay.

729
00:47:31.601 --> 00:47:36.470
Of that 8% coupon till you're 30 and no principal at the end.
Well,

730
00:47:36.471 --> 00:47:40.960
the mortgage has to pay a coupon of 8% that uh,

731
00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.990
you know,
that gives a hundred because the,
the,

732
00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:47.170
if there were no uncertainty and there are no prepayments or anything,

733
00:47:47.171 --> 00:47:48.580
no uncertainty,
the,

734
00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:52.960
the bank giving the coupon is not going to give you money unless its present

735
00:47:52.961 --> 00:47:55.810
value is equal to a hundred so they're going to be willing to pay,

736
00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:59.230
they're going to ask you to pay a coupon.
Okay?
So now you see,

737
00:47:59.231 --> 00:48:03.220
what have I done over here?
This is beach 26 minus B 30.

738
00:48:03.221 --> 00:48:06.970
So the original face was supposed to be a 100 but the present value,

739
00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:11.410
Volvo's payments is only a 99.
Okay.

740
00:48:11.411 --> 00:48:15.640
And so there's a gap here of 0.72 and the square of the gap is that,

741
00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:20.200
and we want to,
the square,
the gap is there and we want to minimize that.

742
00:48:20.201 --> 00:48:22.160
So we're going to find the,

743
00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:25.690
the payment every period solver.

744
00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:28.691
Okay?

745
00:48:28.691 --> 00:48:33.691
So I want to minimize be 32 minimized by choosing be 29 she looks good.

746
00:48:34.361 --> 00:48:36.160
That's the first payment.
Okay.

747
00:48:36.161 --> 00:48:38.050
And all the other payments are said to be equal to that,

748
00:48:38.051 --> 00:48:39.460
to minimize that difference.

749
00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:45.780
<v 1>Uh
Oh,</v>

750
00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:51.450
<v 0>be 29 is the first payment.
So why didn't this work too?</v>

751
00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:54.043
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

752
00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:03.000
<v 0>Is that what I did?
Okay,
so here's a,
that's the thing.
And then this,</v>

753
00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:04.803
<v 1>Oh,
here,</v>

754
00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:08.040
<v 0>why hired wire that in?
Okay,
so I didn't want to do that.</v>

755
00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:11.370
So that's got to be equal to what's left equal.

756
00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:14.000
<v 1>Left.
Uh,</v>

757
00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:18.890
<v 0>okay.
So here I got,
I'm going to hire this and,
okay,
so that's good.</v>

758
00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:23.850
So let's try the same thing now.
So two olds that I have you guys tools.

759
00:49:23.851 --> 00:49:26.190
Okay.
So being 32 is when I'm minimizing bead.

760
00:49:26.191 --> 00:49:29.460
29 is the first payment and all the others have been set equal to it.

761
00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.080
And if I solve,

762
00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:37.180
<v 1>okay.</v>

763
00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:41.030
<v 0>All right,
let's drag the first payment is that year one,
right?
So it should be,</v>

764
00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.340
oh see,
29 thank you.

765
00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:45.943
<v 1>Yeah,
I'm not,</v>

766
00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:51.040
<v 0>that's why I'm confused.
Okay.
See,
29 thanks.
Okay.
Tools.</v>

767
00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:56.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

768
00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:00.230
<v 0>Okay,
so,
so what are those?
Just look at this a second.</v>

769
00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:04.370
So that's what I've hardwired in.
Okay,
so format,
nope.

770
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:06.620
Tools solver.

771
00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:12.180
[inaudible] 32 subject to see 29 as he was told me 20 times.

772
00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:15.620
See 29 and now,
so all of,

773
00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:20.510
okay,
so now we did it.
Okay,

774
00:50:20.511 --> 00:50:24.050
so we got the right payment to make the balance exactly equal to 100 okay,

775
00:50:24.051 --> 00:50:25.580
so that's how a mortgage works.

776
00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:30.230
You have to find the payments such that if you take the present value of that

777
00:50:30.231 --> 00:50:31.760
same coupon payment forever,

778
00:50:31.761 --> 00:50:34.130
it's just going to be worth a hundred which is that number.

779
00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:36.500
And how do you figure out the coupon payment?
Well,

780
00:50:36.501 --> 00:50:39.040
you do it by backward deductions.
Figure out the present value.

781
00:50:39.041 --> 00:50:43.490
You do it by backward induction.
Okay?
But it's just as we did,
but one,

782
00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:47.210
we've gotten a lot of information.
We've gotten this number at every period.

783
00:50:47.211 --> 00:50:50.580
So by doing it by backward induction,
instead of just doing,
you know,

784
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:54.320
the long exponential calculation,
by doing it by backward induction,

785
00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:57.950
we produced the present value at every time in the future.

786
00:50:58.070 --> 00:51:00.620
Now that's an incredibly important number in mortgages.

787
00:51:00.621 --> 00:51:02.210
It's called the remaining balance.

788
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:05.420
Why is that such an important number and mortgages?

789
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:08.690
This will play a very key role.
And the rest of the course.

790
00:51:08.691 --> 00:51:11.360
What is the remaining balance and why is it so important?

791
00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.940
Does anyone know how a mortgage works?
Yup?

792
00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:25.150
Okay.
Now we'd be able to sell it for but a little bit but close.

793
00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:29.320
So when the bank gives you a mortgage,
it says,
okay,

794
00:51:29.321 --> 00:51:30.490
so how did mortgages work?

795
00:51:30.491 --> 00:51:34.480
It used to be in the old days that the mortgages were coupon bonds.

796
00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:37.990
They pay eight eight,
eight,
eight eight 108 okay.

797
00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:41.350
And then what would happen is just before the 108 payment,

798
00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:43.960
everyone would default.
So in the depression,

799
00:51:43.961 --> 00:51:46.810
the people defaulted where people would default to just before their big

800
00:51:46.811 --> 00:51:50.500
principle payment.
So bankers got wise after the depression,
they said,

801
00:51:50.501 --> 00:51:55.030
well that's a terrible thing to do.
We should make the payment be constant.
Okay.

802
00:51:55.031 --> 00:51:58.450
And that way there's no reason for the guide to default right at the end.

803
00:51:58.451 --> 00:52:02.290
And we're not going to get stuck with $100 it's not paid.
So it's constant.

804
00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:04.330
But of course if it's constant,

805
00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:08.440
that means the present value of what's left is going down all the time.
Okay.

806
00:52:08.441 --> 00:52:10.900
So that's why this number is going down all the time.
You know,

807
00:52:10.901 --> 00:52:13.810
if it's 108 at the end,
that's why the present value would stay the same.

808
00:52:13.811 --> 00:52:17.590
So it's going down all the time.
Okay.
So that's uh,

809
00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:20.290
that's why it's called an amortizing mortgage.

810
00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:24.730
It's because what's left in the mortgage is getting smaller all the time.
Okay.

811
00:52:24.731 --> 00:52:29.620
So a mortgage is paid,
a fixed rate mortgage pays the same coupon every year.

812
00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:33.370
The present value of what's left therefore must be going down every year.

813
00:52:33.371 --> 00:52:35.360
And that's why it's called amortizing.
And they,

814
00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:40.180
bankers wanted that to happen because that way their risk is going down every

815
00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:40.181
year.

816
00:52:40.181 --> 00:52:45.100
Every year the house is presumably still worth 120 or whatever it was at the

817
00:52:45.101 --> 00:52:48.010
beginning.
And the amount owed is getting lower and lower.

818
00:52:48.011 --> 00:52:51.810
So the bankers are feeling more and more secure every year because the houses

819
00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:55.300
backing a smaller and smaller loan.
Or to put it another way,

820
00:52:55.301 --> 00:52:58.600
if you're uncertain about what the price of the house will be in the future,

821
00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:02.620
you want to make sure that what is old is going down in the future.
So you don't,

822
00:53:02.730 --> 00:53:05.290
you know,
if the price gradually goes down to the house,

823
00:53:05.291 --> 00:53:07.330
what's owed is gradually going to go down.
Okay.

824
00:53:07.331 --> 00:53:11.890
But the main reason why the number is so important is you have to realize the

825
00:53:11.891 --> 00:53:15.340
purpose of a mortgages.
You take out a loan using the house as collateral.

826
00:53:15.341 --> 00:53:17.500
If you don't make your payment,
they can take your house.
Well,

827
00:53:17.501 --> 00:53:20.440
what happens if you want to move?
Okay,
if you want to move you,

828
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:23.560
you know you're going to sell the house.
The house is no longer collateral.

829
00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:27.060
So if you want to move,
you have to undo the promise to the bank.

830
00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.650
So if in your five,

831
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:32.730
just after you're making your payment of $8 and 5 cents in your five,

832
00:53:32.731 --> 00:53:36.630
you decide to move,
you say to the bank,
you know,
I want to cancel the mortgage.

833
00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:40.140
How much will they ask you to pay?
Well,
the remaining balance,

834
00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:42.990
93 91 okay?
So that's the,

835
00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:47.640
that's why this remaining balance and such an important number.
Okay?

836
00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:52.790
So it allows people to leave their houses and pay off their mortgage by paying

837
00:53:53.161 --> 00:53:54.270
off the remaining balance.

838
00:53:54.271 --> 00:53:57.090
You wouldn't want them to pay a hundred if they laughed cause they've made

839
00:53:57.091 --> 00:53:57.924
payments.

840
00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:03.050
You notice that the payment here is $8 that's bigger than 7% right?

841
00:54:03.691 --> 00:54:05.220
Cause if it's a coupon bond,

842
00:54:05.221 --> 00:54:08.640
you'd pay seven all the way to the end and pay 107 that would have a present

843
00:54:08.641 --> 00:54:11.130
value of a hundred if you're not paying the hundred at the end,

844
00:54:11.131 --> 00:54:13.710
but just making a level payment all the way through the payment you have to make

845
00:54:13.711 --> 00:54:16.140
every year better be more than seven.
So it's eight.

846
00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:21.530
So this eight minus seven is sort of a what you're paying down of your mortgage,

847
00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:24.420
right?
The interest is only seven.
You've paid eight.

848
00:54:24.421 --> 00:54:29.280
That's why you owe less than a hundred you know you've paid a dollar six extra.

849
00:54:29.281 --> 00:54:33.000
That's why you only owe 98 point 94 okay?

850
00:54:33.001 --> 00:54:35.670
So every year you're paying part of your principle down.

851
00:54:35.671 --> 00:54:39.060
That means it's amortizing and it means if you want to get out of the mortgage,

852
00:54:39.061 --> 00:54:42.720
you can get out of it by paying less and less.
It means the,
the lender,

853
00:54:42.721 --> 00:54:46.140
the mortgage lender is more and more protected by the house every year cause

854
00:54:46.141 --> 00:54:48.930
what you owe is less and less.
Okay.
So that's how a mortgage works.

855
00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:54.160
Any questions about that?
All right,
so those,
okay.

856
00:54:54.161 --> 00:54:58.510
So what's the point?
The point is that by simple present value thinking,

857
00:54:58.630 --> 00:55:02.140
you can start to understand the main instruments in the economy,

858
00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:05.320
how mortgages work,
why they're called amortizing,

859
00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:08.590
why the amount you have to pay to get out of your mortgage goes down every year

860
00:55:08.591 --> 00:55:12.970
and exactly how much it goes down every year,
et cetera.
Okay.
But now I want to,

861
00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:17.050
so we can do a lot more examples like that,
but I want to change,

862
00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:22.080
shift the discussion now to a much bigger subject,

863
00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:27.070
a subject of tremendous policy interest in the country.
Uh,

864
00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:29.320
and uh,
namely social security.

865
00:55:29.321 --> 00:55:34.321
What should we do about social security now it will turn out that you can

866
00:55:34.811 --> 00:55:38.020
analyze the situation the same way we've just analyzed these bonds.

867
00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:42.130
It's very simple to figure out what the problem is and what went wrong yet very

868
00:55:42.131 --> 00:55:45.700
few people understand it,
including most of our politicians.

869
00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:49.660
And I'm sorry to say a lot of our economists.
So what is,

870
00:55:49.690 --> 00:55:53.350
so I want to describe now and the next class and a half the social security

871
00:55:53.351 --> 00:55:58.330
problem and,
and how to,
you know,
how to resolve,
you know,

872
00:55:58.331 --> 00:56:00.760
how to solve the problem,
but also how to understand the problem.

873
00:56:00.761 --> 00:56:04.450
You can't figure out the right solution until you've understood what the problem

874
00:56:04.451 --> 00:56:09.010
is.
Okay.
So,
uh,
were there any questions before I start this learning question?

875
00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:09.860
I should have paused.

876
00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:14.140
Are there any questions about the mortgage or present value or how present value

877
00:56:14.141 --> 00:56:18.510
changes through time?
Okay,

878
00:56:18.511 --> 00:56:22.920
so those ideas,
you know,
in marking to market,
those are very important ideas.

879
00:56:22.921 --> 00:56:24.940
I think once you think about them,
not so hard,

880
00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:28.960
I'm now going to take exactly those ideas and apply it to social security where

881
00:56:28.961 --> 00:56:31.960
I bet where the public is totally baffled.

882
00:56:31.961 --> 00:56:35.050
But all you have to do is apply the same thinking.
Okay.

883
00:56:35.051 --> 00:56:37.600
So social security is supposed to be in a terrible crisis.

884
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:40.980
That's what they always tell you.
Um,

885
00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:44.500
it was a big campaign issue in 2000.

886
00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:46.180
You probably were too young to remember that,

887
00:56:46.181 --> 00:56:50.800
but there were three debates between Gore and Bush in which Gore grimaced and

888
00:56:50.801 --> 00:56:52.430
you know,
and uh,

889
00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:56.050
everybody thought he wasn't a good guy and so they voted for Bush and he was

890
00:56:56.051 --> 00:57:00.880
mostly grimacing about social security and a then in 2000,
well,
okay,

891
00:57:00.881 --> 00:57:03.760
I'll get to the future.
So anyway,
they,
in those debates,

892
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.790
three mistakes were made.
Um,

893
00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:11.910
so Bush argued that the returns on social security were disastrously low.

894
00:57:12.341 --> 00:57:16.670
He said the whole program is in a terrible crisis and um,

895
00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:20.500
we've got to privatized to save the system.

896
00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:22.950
Okay.
Um,

897
00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.610
how did they get into the crisis while it wasn't clear exactly how it got into

898
00:57:27.611 --> 00:57:28.570
the crisis,
but,
you know,

899
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:31.060
it seems like the baby boomers had something to do with it.

900
00:57:31.061 --> 00:57:33.250
They're all getting old and they're going to have to get these huge social

901
00:57:33.251 --> 00:57:34.730
security payments and uh,

902
00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:37.870
that's why we're in the crisis because the baby boomers are getting old.

903
00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:41.140
It's all my fault and then they are my generation's fault.

904
00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:45.790
Then the third mistake was Gore said,
well,

905
00:57:45.791 --> 00:57:47.710
it's impossible to privatized.

906
00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:52.740
Privatized means take the money that your parents are paying and social security

907
00:57:52.811 --> 00:57:56.020
and that you'll start to pay instead of putting it into the fund,

908
00:57:56.021 --> 00:57:59.080
which is being used somehow,
you don't probably know exactly how,

909
00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:00.550
instead of doing that,

910
00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:05.590
take that money and say it's the taxpayers' money.
It's your money.

911
00:58:05.591 --> 00:58:09.100
You can put it in the stock market if you want.
So that's what Bush wanted to do.

912
00:58:09.101 --> 00:58:10.540
Privatized social security.

913
00:58:10.541 --> 00:58:15.541
Say your tax contributions should go into a stock market with your name on them.

914
00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:18.910
And Gore said,
well that's impossible.
If you prioritize,

915
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:20.860
what are the old people today going to do?

916
00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:22.240
Where are they going to get the payments?

917
00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:27.300
You can't prioritize social security and take today's young tax contributions to

918
00:58:28.091 --> 00:58:30.910
social security and say,
okay,
you young guys,
they're your money.

919
00:58:30.911 --> 00:58:34.840
You can keep them in the stock market and at the same time pay the old retirees.

920
00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:39.880
So Bush must not know what he's talking about.
So that also was wrong.

921
00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:44.650
So those three things that social security,
uh,
you know,

922
00:58:44.651 --> 00:58:47.440
is going to give terrible returns.
It must be,
it's wasting money.

923
00:58:47.441 --> 00:58:50.560
Something's horribly wrong with it.
The only way to save it,
as to privatize it.

924
00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:53.950
That's bushes,
main claim.
Blame it all on the baby generation.

925
00:58:53.951 --> 00:58:55.090
That's everybody's claim.

926
00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:59.020
And Gore saying you can't prioritize without screwing today's young.

927
00:58:59.350 --> 00:59:03.160
That's all three of those things sound pretty convincing and yet they're all

928
00:59:03.161 --> 00:59:04.600
three wrong.
Okay.

929
00:59:04.601 --> 00:59:07.690
So I want to explain the system to you and help you understand it.

930
00:59:07.691 --> 00:59:11.440
And then I have a policy recommendation you'll get next class,

931
00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:16.450
which you know,
most people don't agree with.
So you probably won't either.
But uh,

932
00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:20.320
but,
but I'll warn you when we get to a point that's controversial,

933
00:59:20.321 --> 00:59:22.110
the point before,
I'm going to say it.

934
00:59:22.111 --> 00:59:24.710
So everything I'm going to say in the first,
you know,

935
00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:28.670
first 90 minutes is going to be uncontroversial.
Hold.
Not everybody knows it,

936
00:59:28.671 --> 00:59:32.060
but I think is obviously it's just a matter of logic and then my conclusion

937
00:59:32.061 --> 00:59:35.840
about what to do,
you can criticize it and I think it's a matter of logic too.

938
00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:37.670
But I had met,
most people don't agree with it.

939
00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:41.750
So now in 2005 bushes was,
if nothing else,

940
00:59:41.751 --> 00:59:44.090
Bush was tremendously consistent.
So,
you know,

941
00:59:44.091 --> 00:59:47.690
whatever he told you he was going to do,
no matter how wrong headed it was,

942
00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:52.430
he did it.
So he said in the debates that he wanted to privatize social security,

943
00:59:52.431 --> 00:59:55.940
and sure enough,
he kept his word.
He launched a huge program.

944
00:59:55.941 --> 01:00:00.080
That's how he started right after the 2004 election is first initiative you

945
01:00:00.081 --> 01:00:03.290
might remember was we've got to privatize social security.

946
01:00:03.291 --> 01:00:08.291
Went on a 60 day 60 city tour to kick off his second term.

947
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:11.150
Okay.
So after the 2004 election,

948
01:00:11.151 --> 01:00:15.200
privatizing social security was a huge issue in the 2008 election.

949
01:00:15.201 --> 01:00:19.070
It was still a big issue.
Mccain said sort of what Bush said,

950
01:00:19.071 --> 01:00:21.260
I want young workers to be able to,
you know,

951
01:00:21.261 --> 01:00:24.470
if they choose to take part of their own money,
which is their taxes,
you know,

952
01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:26.900
their money that's getting taxed and put into social security.

953
01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:29.750
I want them to have their own account and put it into the stock market with

954
01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:33.590
their name on it.
And Obama said he's totally against that.
Okay.

955
01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:38.420
Now after that,
that was 2008.
Recently,
of course,
the,

956
01:00:38.421 --> 01:00:42.890
the public has,
uh,
made another mistake.
And so everybody's saying now,

957
01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:45.350
oh,
the financial crisis,
you know,

958
01:00:45.351 --> 01:00:47.780
we better not talk about social security more anymore.

959
01:00:47.781 --> 01:00:51.710
Nobody's talking about social security.
Um,
you know,
they're saying,
well,

960
01:00:51.711 --> 01:00:55.250
could you imagine what would have happened had we privatized?
And you know,

961
01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:57.830
as Bush wanted us to do in the stock market collapsed,

962
01:00:57.831 --> 01:01:00.830
everybody would have lost all their money.
What a disaster that would have been.

963
01:01:00.831 --> 01:01:04.970
It would have ruined the,
uh,
ruined the old.
Okay.
The sound's pretty persuasive,

964
01:01:04.971 --> 01:01:08.660
you know.
So Krugman wrote a column saying,
you know,
a bullet dodged.

965
01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:11.210
What would have happened if Bush had succeeded?
We all,

966
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:14.780
all the old people would be broke now.
And Robert Rice who was,
you know,

967
01:01:14.781 --> 01:01:17.810
in the Clinton administration,
sorta more or less,
said the same thing.

968
01:01:17.811 --> 01:01:20.120
That would be a disaster.
Um,

969
01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.710
now the Obama administration,
by the way,

970
01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:27.890
hasn't stopped talking about social security.
So their director,
he was,

971
01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.750
he's the director of the White House Office of the budget.

972
01:01:30.751 --> 01:01:35.150
So this is an incredibly important position.
Peter Orszag,
he's the son of a,

973
01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:39.260
there's a math professor here or Zog his father.
So he said,

974
01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:43.250
so he's a friend of mine,
the son,
he said,
uh,
you know,

975
01:01:43.251 --> 01:01:45.110
one healthcare reform is in place.

976
01:01:45.111 --> 01:01:49.460
The US can then focus on other important things,
especially social security.

977
01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:53.360
So Obama wants to do something about it.
He just doesn't want a privatized.

978
01:01:53.361 --> 01:01:56.900
So it's a big problem and everything everybody says about it seems plausible.

979
01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:01.850
Now what,
just to continue along the plausibility of it.
So Bush says,
you know,

980
01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:03.860
what he really wants to do is,

981
01:02:03.861 --> 01:02:07.640
and why private accounts or a better thing is that if you put the money in

982
01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:09.110
private accounts,
it can grow.

983
01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:12.380
You can get a greater rate of return than the current system,
which is terrible.

984
01:02:12.381 --> 01:02:16.970
If you are a young person,
you'll be able to,
you know,
make some,
uh,
you know,

985
01:02:16.971 --> 01:02:21.420
by putting your tax,
social security tax money aside in a private account,

986
01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:24.750
you'll be able to get a better rate of return on your money than the government

987
01:02:24.751 --> 01:02:26.130
could get you on your money.

988
01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:28.110
So why would you just want to give it to the government?

989
01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:32.910
It's for your retirement and you'll be able to pass that money along to your

990
01:02:32.911 --> 01:02:35.910
children and grandchildren.
You know,
if you want at the end.

991
01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:40.830
And Best of all the money's yours and the government can't take it away.
Okay?

992
01:02:40.831 --> 01:02:43.530
So that's what four says.
He said many times.

993
01:02:43.531 --> 01:02:46.230
So there's one sense in which he's right.

994
01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:51.570
So let's look at the returns people got on social security.
Now,

995
01:02:51.571 --> 01:02:55.710
what is the return?
We know what the rate of return is.
How do they calculate it?

996
01:02:55.950 --> 01:03:00.600
You can go back to people born starting in 1878 right?

997
01:03:00.601 --> 01:03:02.310
Social Security,
as you'll see in a second,

998
01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:07.260
I'll give you the history began in 1939 so these people in 1878,

999
01:03:07.261 --> 01:03:11.850
you know,
they're in there.
So you know there's 60 you know,

1000
01:03:11.851 --> 01:03:16.530
when social security's beginning,
um,
my,
my arithmetic is right?

1001
01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:18.870
So they're just being,
you know,
they're 60 at that point.

1002
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:23.310
So you can look at all these people and you can say for every generation in the

1003
01:03:23.311 --> 01:03:27.270
past,
you can say,
how much money did they pay when they were young?

1004
01:03:27.271 --> 01:03:31.260
They paid taxes.
So they got negative,
you know,
negative 12.4,

1005
01:03:31.261 --> 01:03:33.690
that's the tax rate and negative 12.4.

1006
01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:36.000
They did that a bunch of years when they are young.

1007
01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:41.040
And then they started getting payments when they were old,
you know,
24,
24,
20,

1008
01:03:41.041 --> 01:03:45.720
something like that.
Those are the payments when they're old
and now you can,

1009
01:03:45.721 --> 01:03:48.930
so they're negative ones at the beginning and positive ones at the end you can

1010
01:03:48.931 --> 01:03:52.680
calculate the internal rate of return,
the number of the yield,

1011
01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:55.740
the thing that makes this present value zero.
We know how to do that.

1012
01:03:55.741 --> 01:04:00.360
We've done it.
So people have done this.
So there's a guy named Lemur.

1013
01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:01.800
Okay.
Uh,

1014
01:04:01.830 --> 01:04:06.060
at the Lima or Lemur from the Social Security Administration who did these

1015
01:04:06.061 --> 01:04:08.790
calculations prompted a little bit by me.

1016
01:04:08.791 --> 01:04:13.170
So I should say that a lot of the reason I got started thinking about this as I

1017
01:04:13.171 --> 01:04:16.620
got put on a presidential panel,
um,

1018
01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:19.410
to study social security reform,
uh,

1019
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:23.490
and the Clinton administration and every Democrat was matched with Republicans.

1020
01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:26.310
So the two chairman,
one Democrat,
one Republican,

1021
01:04:26.311 --> 01:04:30.510
all the way along there was Democrat and Republican.
And after Bush got elected,

1022
01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:35.270
all the Democrats got kicked off the committee.
But anyway,
so the,
so in,

1023
01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:38.120
in any case,
the,
uh,

1024
01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:43.680
here are the rates of return for people who are old.
When the program began,

1025
01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:45.690
they got sensational rates of returns,
you know,

1026
01:04:45.691 --> 01:04:50.550
40% 30% incredible rates of return as the generations,

1027
01:04:50.551 --> 01:04:52.780
you know,
get younger and younger,
uh,

1028
01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:57.060
the returns go lower and lower and they're down now to 2%.
You know,

1029
01:04:57.061 --> 01:05:02.000
these are forecasted,
these rates of returns.
And so,
you know,
you,
let's see,

1030
01:05:02.001 --> 01:05:05.540
you're 20,
say something on average.
So you're born and it's,
you know,
it's,

1031
01:05:05.541 --> 01:05:10.020
you're born in 1990,
something like that.
So,
or around there,
so the uh,

1032
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:14.730
here's your rate of return.
It's a down here,
right?
It's 2%.

1033
01:05:14.731 --> 01:05:17.620
It's let you know and there is a blown up.
It's under 2%.

1034
01:05:17.621 --> 01:05:21.610
So these are the people from 1924 to 2002.
So you're right at the end here.

1035
01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:23.530
That's your rate of return blown up.

1036
01:05:23.650 --> 01:05:27.670
You can only expect one and a half or 2% so George Bushes,
right?

1037
01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:30.340
The rate of return on social security is terrible.

1038
01:05:30.341 --> 01:05:33.730
If you look at the taxes that you put in and you look at the benefits that you

1039
01:05:33.731 --> 01:05:37.060
can expect to get,
your generation's getting totally screwed.

1040
01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:41.080
Okay,
so now if you look historically,

1041
01:05:41.081 --> 01:05:45.250
this was done in 1994 so the numbers a little bit,
uh,

1042
01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:47.170
it's not quite as dramatic,

1043
01:05:47.171 --> 01:05:50.860
but it hasn't changed as much as you think from money put in the stock market

1044
01:05:50.861 --> 01:05:55.060
between 26 and 2004 that's before the crash of 29 the crash.

1045
01:05:55.061 --> 01:05:58.000
So I should've gotten the number after the reason crash.

1046
01:05:58.001 --> 01:06:00.820
It doesn't change that much.
Before the crash of 29,

1047
01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:03.100
you looked at keeping your money in the stock market,

1048
01:06:03.310 --> 01:06:06.580
just leaving it there for all that time after inflation,

1049
01:06:06.581 --> 01:06:10.300
you'd get 9.1% return on treasury bonds,

1050
01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:14.860
you get 2.7% return.
And yet on social security,

1051
01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:19.000
you're going to get under 2% okay?
So George Bush says,
look,

1052
01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:23.500
put it in the stock market.
Get 9% okay,
we had a little disaster here,
but a,

1053
01:06:23.501 --> 01:06:25.890
so maybe it's 7% put it in the stock market.

1054
01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:30.320
Get 7% why be satisfied with 2% there's something wrong.
We've got to prioritize.

1055
01:06:30.321 --> 01:06:33.460
Put an end to this.
Okay,
so all right,

1056
01:06:33.461 --> 01:06:35.410
so there seems to be something to what he's saying.

1057
01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:39.520
So now you look at what's going on with social security.

1058
01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.320
So what happens in social security?

1059
01:06:41.321 --> 01:06:44.020
I'm going to explain the whole history and how it works here.

1060
01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:46.690
What happens is you pay taxes,

1061
01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:49.900
12.4% tax.

1062
01:06:49.901 --> 01:06:53.920
You probably know that everybody's paying taxes on the money they make and then

1063
01:06:53.921 --> 01:06:58.210
their benefits that are being paid.
Now the benefits are not,

1064
01:06:58.211 --> 01:07:00.340
there's a formula for benefits,

1065
01:07:00.341 --> 01:07:03.250
which doesn't have anything to do with the amount of taxes being paid.

1066
01:07:03.490 --> 01:07:07.000
So at the present time,
the taxes are bigger than the benefits.

1067
01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:10.780
So where does the extra money go?
It goes into the social security trust fund.

1068
01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:15.100
So here's the social security trust fund,
which is now round 2 trillion,

1069
01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:18.970
which is going to keep growing because contributions are going to be bigger than

1070
01:07:18.971 --> 01:07:23.740
benefits until 2020 or so.
And at that point,
contributions,
you know,

1071
01:07:23.741 --> 01:07:28.300
that's the baby boom generation.
That's me retiring.
So,
or you know,

1072
01:07:28.350 --> 01:07:30.260
a little later in my case.
But anyway,
the baby,

1073
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:32.800
maybe we'll Jenner and facts and someone yelled,
professor,

1074
01:07:32.801 --> 01:07:37.180
it's out here somewhere.
Anyway,
so do you know,
so anyway,

1075
01:07:37.181 --> 01:07:40.740
my generation's going to start retiring here and then the benefits.

1076
01:07:40.741 --> 01:07:42.940
So we're going to be not working,
not paying taxes,

1077
01:07:42.941 --> 01:07:46.330
but we're collecting benefits and there's so many of us that the benefits are

1078
01:07:46.331 --> 01:07:49.660
going to be less than the taxes and the trust funds going to go down and down

1079
01:07:49.661 --> 01:07:51.040
and down.
And the New Year,

1080
01:07:51.041 --> 01:07:54.880
2030 a little bit more than 2030 the trust fund is going to go to zero.

1081
01:07:55.090 --> 01:08:00.090
And then after that the taxes are still going to be a smaller than the benefits.

1082
01:08:00.971 --> 01:08:01.930
And so what's going to happen,

1083
01:08:01.931 --> 01:08:04.480
there'll be no money to pay these people and there's going to have to be a big

1084
01:08:04.481 --> 01:08:05.950
drop and what people are getting.

1085
01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:09.970
So it looks like the system is not only paying a horrible rate of return,

1086
01:08:09.971 --> 01:08:12.130
it doesn't even look like it's,
you know,
it's an,
I'm going to pay,

1087
01:08:12.131 --> 01:08:15.200
it's going to run out of money and go broke in 2040.

1088
01:08:15.201 --> 01:08:18.650
So it seems like a total a disaster.
Okay.

1089
01:08:18.770 --> 01:08:23.030
So that's the setting of the question.
George Bush said,
it's a disaster.

1090
01:08:23.031 --> 01:08:26.450
It looks at first glance like a disaster.
The newspapers tell you all the time,

1091
01:08:26.451 --> 01:08:31.070
it's a disaster.
How did it get to me so bad?
And what should we do about it?

1092
01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:35.780
All right?
Now it's going to turn out that by using the concept of present value,

1093
01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:40.070
it can be very simple and straight forward to understand.

1094
01:08:40.250 --> 01:08:44.270
And it's going to be the exact opposite of what everybody seems to be saying.

1095
01:08:44.690 --> 01:08:46.460
So I,
uh,

1096
01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:50.870
I'm gonna play you a clip next time of Roosevelt announcing the social security

1097
01:08:50.871 --> 01:08:54.500
program.
And this lady behind him is Frances Perkins,

1098
01:08:54.501 --> 01:08:58.790
the first woman to ever be the,
uh,
in the cabinet.

1099
01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:02.810
And she played a tremendous role in shaping social security.

1100
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:06.320
So after,
uh,

1101
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:10.800
Roosevelt started social security in 2004,
um,

1102
01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:14.420
I'm wondering whether I really have time to do this.
So I'll just say this.

1103
01:09:14.570 --> 01:09:19.570
So Roosevelt started the program in 2000 in 1938 39,

1104
01:09:21.650 --> 01:09:23.780
he started the program in 38 39.

1105
01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:27.620
It was one of the cornerstones of the new deal.

1106
01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:31.580
It's an incredibly famous program and it seems to be incredible trouble.

1107
01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:35.030
So we need to find out and get to the bottom of why that is,

1108
01:09:35.031 --> 01:09:36.620
and then we'll start doing that next class.
