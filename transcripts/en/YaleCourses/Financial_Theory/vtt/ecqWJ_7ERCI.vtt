1
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.120
All right,
well today I'm going to talk about social security again.

2
00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:09.690
There's going to be one more,
a discussion of social security later.

3
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:13.830
I'm going to defer most of my plan until later,
but,
uh,

4
00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:18.210
I want to finish the discussion so that we totally understand the subject.

5
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:22.170
It will also allow me to talk about demography and introduced one of the most

6
00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:26.100
famous models in economics called the overlapping generation model.

7
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.310
So in the 1940s,

8
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.640
so on named Maurice La an a a French economist introduced the overlapping

9
00:00:36.811 --> 00:00:38.910
generations model into economics.

10
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.993
<v 1>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.540
<v 0>He wrote it in French,
uh,</v>

12
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.910
and it was sort of rediscovered by Sam has done in the 1950s.

13
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.863
<v 1>Okay.</v>

14
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.220
<v 0>I'm not sure whether Samson had red outlay lay.</v>

15
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:59.000
I think Samson may well have read La.
But Anyway,
Sam Hansen,
uh,

16
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:01.700
so these were 1947,
something like that.

17
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:06.290
1958 in which Samuelson rediscovered it and it,

18
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.300
it's a,
you'll see,

19
00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:13.301
it's a very basic thought and it seemed at first to challenge everything that

20
00:01:13.491 --> 00:01:14.810
we've learned so far.

21
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.710
So the idea of the overlap in generations models that time doesn't have a

22
00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:19.760
beginning and an end.

23
00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:24.710
Like we've assumed so far a time might go on forever.
Now,

24
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.870
whether or not you believe time,

25
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.980
whether there's scientific proof that time goes on forever or scientific proof

26
00:01:30.981 --> 00:01:34.070
that the universe has to come to an end.
Let's face it.

27
00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:37.070
Many of our institutions presume that time goes on forever.

28
00:01:37.071 --> 00:01:41.270
The chief most important among them is social security.
Just the most,

29
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.040
uh,
which we'll see is the easiest thing to the model is designed to,

30
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.740
to understand the idea of social security's every,

31
00:01:50.741 --> 00:01:53.060
the the pay as you go social security.

32
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.233
<v 1>Okay.</v>

33
00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.700
<v 0>The idea of Frances Perkins was that every young generation was going to give</v>

34
00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:02.630
money to the old,

35
00:02:02.631 --> 00:02:05.240
but they shouldn't worry so much about it because when they got old,

36
00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:07.490
the the next young generation will give them money.

37
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.460
Obviously if you thought time was going to come to an end,

38
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.260
the last young generation,

39
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.490
knowing that they were the last generation would refuse to give money to the old

40
00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:18.890
because they weren't going to get anything back when they were old.

41
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.190
But then the second to last generation,
knowing that when they got old,

42
00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:24.440
they get nothing from the last generation,
that young,

43
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.220
they wouldn't give anything either to the old and working backwards like that.

44
00:02:28.221 --> 00:02:31.490
If everybody is rational and it's common knowledge that the world is going to

45
00:02:31.491 --> 00:02:34.670
end,
nobody would ever participate in the social security scheme.

46
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.420
So it's clear that there's some thought that the world might end,

47
00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:42.200
or at least there's a thought that it's not worth bothering about the world

48
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.873
ending.

49
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.880
So the overlapping generations model is meant to take that idea extremely

50
00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:53.870
seriously
and imagine life going on forever.

51
00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:58.871
So let's take the simplest example where this was a generation that begins.

52
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.310
So generations

53
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.370
<v 2>last when they're a young and old.</v>

54
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.730
So let's say we're at time a one here.

55
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.910
<v 3>Okay.</v>

56
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.360
<v 2>Okay.
And there's a generation that's young and a generation that's old.</v>

57
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.180
Maybe I'll write it a little bit lower.
Sorry about that.

58
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.821
Okay,

59
00:03:19.821 --> 00:03:23.930
so there's an old generation and the young generation and the endowment of the

60
00:03:23.931 --> 00:03:27.710
old generation is,
is one.
The young generation has three.

61
00:03:27.711 --> 00:03:30.890
One is young one when it's old three when it's young one,

62
00:03:30.891 --> 00:03:35.000
when it's old three when it's young one when it's old.
So when you're young,

63
00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:39.140
you have three,
three apples.
When you're old,
you have one apple.

64
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.220
The next generation when it's young has three apples.
When it's old,

65
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:44.630
it has one apple and so on forever.

66
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.680
So this'll be t equals one here,

67
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.340
two here,
three here,
four here,

68
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.893
<v 3>et cetera.</v>

69
00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.770
<v 2>So it goes on forever like that.
Now what did I lay in?
Samson?</v>

70
00:04:00.771 --> 00:04:04.250
Both basically say they both basically said,
look,

71
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.460
everybody when they're young is incredibly well off.
They're working,

72
00:04:07.461 --> 00:04:10.790
they're productive.
When they're old and retired and feeble,

73
00:04:10.791 --> 00:04:14.650
they don't have very much.
But what is it that the but,

74
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.470
but what can you do?
What were,
can you trained according to Samuelson?

75
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.250
What do the,
what does the old have to trade?
You know,

76
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.900
that it doesn't look like

77
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.833
<v 3>Gotcha.</v>

78
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.480
<v 2>There's any trade that can take place.</v>

79
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.720
So it seems like it would be very helpful if the old would give the new summer.

80
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.570
It was the young would give the old something and when they got old,

81
00:04:36.571 --> 00:04:40.590
the next generation's old young could give them something so the young could,

82
00:04:40.591 --> 00:04:45.591
can just constantly be making gifts to the old that was a la in San Francisco

83
00:04:45.751 --> 00:04:48.360
idea and it's very closely related to social security.

84
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.070
So Sam Hansen got a little carried away with his idea and he said that social

85
00:04:53.071 --> 00:04:58.071
security was the greatest and only true a beneficial Ponzi scheme ever invented

86
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.230
because you know,
in a Ponzi scheme,
this has gotten a lot of attention lately.

87
00:05:04.231 --> 00:05:05.310
Thanks to our,

88
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.480
<v 3>okay,</v>

89
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.890
<v 2>thanks to our uh,
famous,
uh,
Madoff.</v>

90
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.220
So the,
a Ponzi scheme is basically a,

91
00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:20.221
an investment strategy where you take the money that people give you and you buy

92
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:22.330
yachts with it.

93
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.140
And then when they asked for their money back when they asked for their money

94
00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:27.590
back,
you tell them,
well,
you've,

95
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.990
that you've gotten great returns and you just hand them money that new people

96
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.660
have given you.
So they think you've gotten great returns.

97
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.660
And when that second generation of people wants their money back,

98
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.780
you tell them what you've invested in brilliantly.
I've gotten great returns,

99
00:05:40.781 --> 00:05:42.940
but all you're doing is giving them the money that the next,

100
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.440
the third generation has given you.

101
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:47.710
And you kept going like that until finally you owe so much money,

102
00:05:47.711 --> 00:05:50.590
you can't find new people fast enough to pay the people off.

103
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.580
And then everybody discovers the Ponzi scheme and it all unravels.
And,
uh,

104
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.640
the people at the beginning of May.
Dot.
Very well.
And the,
at the end who,
uh,

105
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:00.320
you know,
the second to last generation,

106
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:05.300
they've lost all their money and then lawsuits go,
you know,
lawsuits accumulate.

107
00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:08.420
And uh,
it's quite interesting that in the Ponzi scheme,

108
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.180
the very first generations,
you know,

109
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.930
that benefited are not free because the whole thing was a ski,
you know,

110
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:18.620
the whole thing the guy made off running at knew from the beginning what was

111
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:21.440
going to happen.
And so those first generation of people,

112
00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:23.900
there's no reason why they deserve to make their great returns.

113
00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:25.490
They benefited from the Ponzi scheme.

114
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:30.290
So the last generation's suing Maydoff are effectively suing the first people as

115
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:32.420
well.
And so we'll see how the courts decided,

116
00:06:32.421 --> 00:06:37.421
but often the people who get out of the Ponzi scheme early still are how liable

117
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.850
and the money's taken back.
So we'll see what happens in this case.
But anyway,

118
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.380
so obviously Ponzi schemes are terrible ideas in general,
but Samuelson said,

119
00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:47.720
well,
when,
when life is going on forever,

120
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.260
then they might not have to be an end to the skiing.
It just keeps going.

121
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:53.420
This guy gives to this guy,
this guy gives to this guy.

122
00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:56.790
There's no reason for the Ponzi scheme to end if you really think that the world

123
00:06:56.791 --> 00:07:01.520
is going to go on forever.
And therefore social security is a great Ponzi scheme,

124
00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:02.990
which is actually beneficial.

125
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.850
So Samuelson even wrote this and as a journalist for Newsweek,

126
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:08.990
and there's many,

127
00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:12.740
I happened to be a little boy when he was writing this stuff and I remember some

128
00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:15.530
of the articles and I've gone and found them.
And uh,

129
00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:19.730
so he described the benefits of social security as a Ponzi scheme.

130
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.740
So,
you know,
this didn't turn out to be quite right.

131
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.780
And uh,
but it,
it certainly sounds plausible.

132
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.070
Another thing he said was,
he said that in the social security,
you know,

133
00:07:34.071 --> 00:07:38.390
money you could think of as a Ponzi scheme money too,

134
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.140
because you know you have worthless pieces of paper,
you know,
but,

135
00:07:42.141 --> 00:07:46.130
but you're willing to hold them when you're young,
you'll accept them for,

136
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.960
for goods because when you get old,

137
00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:50.900
you can find the next guy who's willing to give up goods for your money.

138
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.780
And that guy's willing to take the money for it because when he gets old,

139
00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:57.290
he can find the next generations young who's willing to give them goods for his

140
00:07:57.291 --> 00:08:01.970
money.
So the money,
which is a worthless piece of paper never gets,
um,

141
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.700
never,
never gets exposed as being worthless.

142
00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:07.970
Cause there's always another generation around to take it who thinks they're

143
00:08:07.971 --> 00:08:12.740
going to be able to use it later.
So these are fascinating topics that Samuelson,

144
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.870
um,
discussed.

145
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:16.770
<v 1>Okay.</v>

146
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.870
<v 2>But I don't want to discuss them in this class.</v>

147
00:08:18.871 --> 00:08:22.530
I want to discuss social security and so I'm going to do a variant of the model

148
00:08:22.531 --> 00:08:27.470
that Samson never thought about,
which I think is a much more realistic model.

149
00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:30.480
So I'm going to do overlapping generations with land.

150
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.233
<v 1>Okay.</v>

151
00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.270
<v 2>And you'll see that in this model,</v>

152
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.830
I'm going to add land to it.
It's I think a more interesting model.

153
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.030
And we're going to,

154
00:08:42.031 --> 00:08:46.470
and I'm not going to discuss the paradoxes of infinity because once you put
land,

155
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.400
even though time goes on forever,
the paradox is disappear.

156
00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.840
So rather than spending all the time on the paradoxes and how they come about

157
00:08:54.841 --> 00:08:55.890
and do make sense,

158
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.430
<v 0>I'm just going to have land from the beginning and we're gonna,
it's gonna,</v>

159
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.980
you know,

160
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.610
it will recapitulate in a nice way almost everything we've done this semester

161
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:05.850
and there won't be any paradoxes.
So what do I mean by land?

162
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.590
I mean suppose that land is a producer's one.

163
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.350
So this is land output.

164
00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:14.913
<v 1>Okay.</v>

165
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.180
<v 0>Produces one every period.</v>

166
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.310
<v 3>So there's another output call</v>

167
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.270
<v 0>apples that just,
you know,
a tree that's going to live forever,</v>

168
00:09:25.271 --> 00:09:29.770
let's call it land produces one every single period.
So here are the periods,

169
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.710
you know,
and this is what's happening and every period,

170
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.160
okay,
now land seems to make the situation much more complicated,

171
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.600
but in fact it will turn out that we can analyze this pretty easily.

172
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:50.790
So let me,
let me summarize again.

173
00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:53.850
The model.
The model is that every generation,

174
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.780
every generation has one agent or a million identical agents.

175
00:09:57.781 --> 00:09:59.470
Let's say every generation

176
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.570
has endowments.

177
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:07.160
So every generation tea has endowment.

178
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:15.290
It's generation t.
So it's an endowment at time t and at time t plus one

179
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:19.430
<v 3>equal three one.</v>

180
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:25.700
<v 0>And let's say they all have utility and the utility of every generation t which</v>

181
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.340
only depends on what they consume when they're young and old.

182
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.830
<v 1>Okay?</v>

183
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:34.160
<v 0>Let's say is log a,</v>

184
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:38.960
x t plus log white,
uh,

185
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.250
x t plus one.

186
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:44.461
Okay?

187
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:48.540
So everybody cares about consumption when they're young consumption with their

188
00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:51.210
old,
they don't care about consumption any other time.

189
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.220
They begin with three apples.
When they're young,

190
00:10:53.221 --> 00:10:55.200
they know they're going to have one apple when they're old.

191
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.790
Everybody's like that for generation t greater than or equal to one.

192
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:05.100
But generation a zero just has you.

193
00:11:05.101 --> 00:11:10.101
So I can call that ut generation zero is only cares about consumption when old.

194
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.920
And that's that guy at the top.

195
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:18.083
<v 3>Okay.</v>

196
00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:23.230
<v 0>What I'll have to talk about,
the land generation zero owns the land.</v>

197
00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.040
Okay?
So that's the economy.

198
00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:35.410
Very simple economy.

199
00:11:35.411 --> 00:11:39.370
But it looks much more complicated than anything we've done before.

200
00:11:39.371 --> 00:11:41.950
But we'll turn out not to be,
but it looks at it first glance.

201
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:46.240
So every generation has three apples.
One young,
one apple,
one old,

202
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.540
except the very first generation which has land.

203
00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.240
And that in addition to his one apple,
one old,

204
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:57.010
and that a land produces one apple forever.

205
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.250
So we have to figure out what equilibrium is.

206
00:12:00.251 --> 00:12:03.520
And then we have to look at social security.
And by doing this,

207
00:12:03.521 --> 00:12:06.880
we're gonna understand social security much better than we did before.

208
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:12.700
Okay?
So any questions about this?
What's going on?

209
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:16.870
Then I'm going to try and write down what equilibrium is and then solve it.

210
00:12:16.871 --> 00:12:19.270
And then we're going to talk about social security.
Yup.

211
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.033
<v 1>Yes.</v>

212
00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.780
<v 0>Oh,
well,
you know,
if you only can eat one good.
If I put log x one here,</v>

213
00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.390
it would be the same thing.

214
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.990
Remember if I take a monotonic transformation,

215
00:12:35.991 --> 00:12:40.880
if I double the utility or take the utility e to the utility like that,

216
00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.360
which is just equal to x one,
it describes the same utility.

217
00:12:44.361 --> 00:12:46.880
The guy's not trading anything off.
There's only one good.

218
00:12:46.881 --> 00:12:49.520
So more of the good is better for him.
It doesn't matter what we call it,

219
00:12:49.521 --> 00:12:52.760
log x or x one is the same thing.
But that's a good question.

220
00:12:52.761 --> 00:12:56.120
Let's call it log x one.
Make him symmetric.
Okay.

221
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:02.200
All right.
Well how would we define ECQUA?

222
00:13:02.201 --> 00:13:06.790
Librium so there's financial equilibrium and then we're going to see if we can

223
00:13:06.791 --> 00:13:09.640
solve this.
So what's happening in financial equilibrium?

224
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.010
Well,
it's kind of interesting here.

225
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:20.020
There's going to have to be a price of goods every period QT,

226
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.470
that's the contemporaneous price of apples.

227
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:28.300
There's going to be the price of land.
Every period.
Pie,
let's call it t.

228
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.580
So this is apple price.

229
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.880
So these are contemporaneous prices.

230
00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:42.460
<v 1>Yeah.
Oh,
okay.</v>

231
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.030
With uh,

232
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.440
<v 0>contemporaneous apple price.
Land Price.</v>

233
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:53.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

234
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.340
<v 0>Okay.
What else do we need?
Well,</v>

235
00:13:56.341 --> 00:13:59.160
we have to decide when everybody's going to consume every period.

236
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:03.420
So generation t what they're going to consume when young and one old.

237
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:07.543
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

238
00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.880
<v 0>And then there's generation zero what they're going to consume when old.</v>

239
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:15.020
What else do I need to describe?
An equilibrium?

240
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.023
<v 1>Probably yet.</v>

241
00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.320
<v 0>So what's the budget said?
Everybody's going to face</v>

242
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:36.310
a budget set for t greater than or equal to one is the set of all,

243
00:14:36.881 --> 00:14:40.210
let's call it young consumption and old consumption.

244
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:43.560
So let's what you can,

245
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.830
so generation t cause we've got to consume something when young and one old such

246
00:14:47.831 --> 00:14:51.280
that what?
What's the budget constraint?
Well,
when they're young,

247
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.420
if they want to consume goods,

248
00:14:53.421 --> 00:14:57.890
they have to spend QT to consume goods.

249
00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:03.560
So this is young.
Call that y.
Okay.

250
00:15:03.561 --> 00:15:06.920
And when they're old,
they're going to have to consume,

251
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.830
sorry.
When they're young to consume that,
what else would they want to do?

252
00:15:11.831 --> 00:15:13.420
They might want to old land.

253
00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:18.810
So we could call that Pi ti and I better add a feta here for their holding of

254
00:15:19.721 --> 00:15:23.490
land.
Hey,

255
00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:28.500
hi t plus theta.
That's how much land they hold.
Remember how we did this?

256
00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:33.630
Okay.
And then what?
What have they got?
Well,
they've got their endowment time.

257
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:35.720
T uh,

258
00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:39.360
this is time t let's say this is generation t.

259
00:15:39.361 --> 00:15:44.220
So their endowment is going to B e t t but that's three.

260
00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.700
So I might as well write e t t just as three.

261
00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.450
Okay.
And what else have they got?

262
00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.233
<v 1>Nothing.</v>

263
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:04.910
<v 0>Everybody comes into the world with just apples when young and apples with old.</v>

264
00:16:04.911 --> 00:16:08.930
So when they're young,
they've got three apples they can sell.
Okay.
They,
you know,

265
00:16:08.931 --> 00:16:12.670
they can consume something.
So three minus Q,
the stuff they don't consume,

266
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.600
they sell and they can buy land with it.
I have all this time,

267
00:16:17.601 --> 00:16:18.434
it's never happened.

268
00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:20.843
<v 1>MMM,</v>

269
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.320
<v 0>sorry about that.</v>

270
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.930
Okay.
And then when they're old,
what can they do?
Well,
when they're old,

271
00:16:34.931 --> 00:16:39.760
acute t plus one.
Okay.
Times Z.

272
00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:44.140
Now are they going to bother to hold the land when they're old?
No,

273
00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.050
because they're going to be dead and they don't care about their children.

274
00:16:47.051 --> 00:16:48.940
All they care about is eating as much as they can.

275
00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:50.500
So they're going to sell all their land.

276
00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:55.540
So that's gotta be less than or equal to what?
And so here's the,
uh,

277
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:59.920
what are they going to get when they're old?
Will they have cute t plus one

278
00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:06.660
when they're old and their endowment of one plus what they can sell their land.

279
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.520
Pi t plus one
times theta.

280
00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.890
Whatever they bought the first time,
they can now sell when they're old.
Plus.

281
00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:20.560
What else do they have

282
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:31.110
one last term.
What else is that?
So see what they do it.

283
00:17:31.111 --> 00:17:34.890
Why would you buy land while,
because when you're young,
you're so rich,

284
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.440
you know you don't want to consume everything when you're young.

285
00:17:37.441 --> 00:17:40.110
So instead of consuming your whole free,
you consume less,

286
00:17:40.111 --> 00:17:43.260
you buy the land because the land is going to be worth something next period.

287
00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.450
So what is it going to give for you next period?

288
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:51.150
What do you get next period from the land?
Well,
if you own the land,

289
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:55.740
you get what?
You get the dividend.

290
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.280
Okay,
so the dividend,
we have to multiply it by the price,

291
00:17:59.281 --> 00:18:01.650
which on the one of the early classes I forgot.

292
00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:06.570
And the dividend is one that's the dividend.
But how many dividends do you get?

293
00:18:06.571 --> 00:18:09.180
How many apples?
It depends on how much of the land you had.

294
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:13.800
So if you had fade a units of the land,
you get,
you know,

295
00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:17.100
if you had three acres of land,
you get three apples,

296
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.410
which you can sell for a price QT plus one.

297
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.750
You also still have the three acres of land,

298
00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.210
which you can sell off when you're old.
Okay?

299
00:18:24.211 --> 00:18:26.970
So that's the revenue you get by selling off the land.

300
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.240
And you also sell off some of your endowment may be,

301
00:18:30.241 --> 00:18:31.860
and that's how you can buy when you're old.

302
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:36.810
So that's what the budget set is of the young,
of every generation.

303
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.560
And the budget set for generation t equals zero

304
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:50.780
is simply x one is simply Z,

305
00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:55.890
we'll call it,
you know,
z such that,
what does this guy do?

306
00:18:56.190 --> 00:19:00.030
Well,
[inaudible] Z has to be less than or equal to.

307
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:05.780
What does he have Q one times one plus he's got all the land.

308
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.410
So he's got one acre of land.

309
00:19:10.411 --> 00:19:14.880
That's all the land there was.
So he's got high times,

310
00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:19.710
uh,
Pi one,
he's got all the land.

311
00:19:19.711 --> 00:19:23.370
So I'm normalize the land to be one acre.
Okay.

312
00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:27.720
So Pi one times,
uh,
all land,

313
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:30.600
that's what that guy can do.

314
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.680
Okay.
So aqua Librium is a x,
t e

315
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:44.100
x t plus one
is best,

316
00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:51.140
a four generation t in budget set t and x one.

317
00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:59.310
So this is this and theta.
Okay.

318
00:19:59.311 --> 00:20:02.770
An x one.
Did I write Fado?

319
00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:05.820
I forgot to write feta and the definition of equilibrium here.

320
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:10.890
So I have to write a theta t.
They're also having to keep track of what,
uh,

321
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.750
what,
how much land they're going to have.

322
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:18.750
And this is t equals one to infinity.
Okay.

323
00:20:18.751 --> 00:20:22.860
So the equilibrium is what are the prices every period of apples and land.

324
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:26.160
What does every age generation do in terms of their consumption and how much

325
00:20:26.161 --> 00:20:30.300
land they hold and how much do you consume when you're,

326
00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.090
how much is that very first generation consume?

327
00:20:33.091 --> 00:20:36.360
It's obviously they're going to sell all their land to consume as much as they

328
00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:40.770
can.
So the budget set,
so x one,
uh,
Saul's,

329
00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:46.720
so z equals x one and y z Feta equals

330
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.960
<v 2>that,
uh,</v>

331
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:54.990
best regeneration t in this budget set and z equals x one is vast.

332
00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:57.420
<v 1>Okay?</v>

333
00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:01.260
<v 2>Regeneration.
Zero in this budget set.</v>

334
00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.133
<v 1>Okay?</v>

335
00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:07.560
<v 2>Okay.
So to say it in words,
it's very simple and words.</v>

336
00:21:07.561 --> 00:21:10.020
And then we have this mathematics and it looks complicated,

337
00:21:10.021 --> 00:21:13.680
but we're just gonna say it's gonna be very short to solve it,

338
00:21:13.681 --> 00:21:17.190
even though it looks very complicated.
So the problem is this.

339
00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:21.240
We've got generations who are rich,
one young,
poor,
one old.

340
00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.640
There's land that lasts forever.

341
00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:28.380
The only way people can save is by holding the land.
That's like holding stock,

342
00:21:28.381 --> 00:21:30.900
that's holding something real.
So when they're young,

343
00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:34.590
they're going to take some of their extra endowment because they're so rich.

344
00:21:34.591 --> 00:21:38.070
When young,
they've got three one young and they're going to use it to buy land.

345
00:21:38.071 --> 00:21:41.100
And when they get old,
they're going to,
uh,
uh,

346
00:21:41.101 --> 00:21:44.040
sell the land and eat the endowment from the land,

347
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.550
the dividend for the land and sell the land and use that sale.

348
00:21:47.551 --> 00:21:50.520
Proceed to also increase their consumption when old.

349
00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:53.700
So there'll be taken care of when they're old because they're able to hold the

350
00:21:53.701 --> 00:21:55.020
land.
And the question is,

351
00:21:55.021 --> 00:21:57.930
how do we solve for the sacral Librium and so why is it,

352
00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:02.670
so just to go back to Sam Wilson and all that,
why is it so interesting?
Well,

353
00:22:02.671 --> 00:22:06.900
one of the reasons it's interesting is that people when they're young,

354
00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:12.050
have to think about the price of land next period when they're old because they

355
00:22:12.391 --> 00:22:15.300
know they're buying the land today.
They can see the price today,

356
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:18.870
but when they get old,
they have to,
you know,
why are they buying the land today?

357
00:22:18.871 --> 00:22:21.360
Partly for the dividend next period when they're old,

358
00:22:21.361 --> 00:22:25.380
but also for the resale value of the land.
So everybody is thinking to himself,

359
00:22:25.381 --> 00:22:27.780
what's the value of land going to be next period.

360
00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:31.470
And of course the value of land next period depends on what the young in that

361
00:22:31.471 --> 00:22:32.640
period are willing to pay.

362
00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:35.430
But they're thinking about what they're willing to pay on the basis of what they

363
00:22:35.431 --> 00:22:37.080
expect to happen the period after.

364
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.320
So everybody has to think about the guy after him and what the guy after him is

365
00:22:40.321 --> 00:22:42.210
thinking about what the guy after him,
his thinking.

366
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.730
And it looks very complicated.
Okay.

367
00:22:44.731 --> 00:22:48.000
And we want to solve for an equilibrium in which everybody can rationally

368
00:22:48.001 --> 00:22:50.550
anticipate with the guy in front of him is going to do,

369
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.540
which means rationally anticipate what that guy is rationally anticipating the

370
00:22:54.541 --> 00:22:57.570
guy in front of him is going to do and you have to solve for the whole

371
00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.620
equilibrium and see how it turns out.
Okay.
Any questions about this?

372
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:08.670
It looks very hard,
but it's going to turn out to be very,
very simple.
Yes.

373
00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:16.363
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

374
00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.320
<v 2>Uh,
okay.
Because by the way,</v>

375
00:23:27.321 --> 00:23:30.770
I haven't said what happens to the uh,
dividend in period zero.

376
00:23:30.771 --> 00:23:35.150
So actually I think that was a good point.
So he gets one,

377
00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.730
he also gets the dividend in period zero.

378
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:45.470
I'm glad you asked that question.
I had neglected what happened to that v.
Okay,

379
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:50.360
so to answer your question,
remember the convention that we've made,

380
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.760
which holds in the market?
You know,

381
00:23:52.761 --> 00:23:55.220
and it's one of the reasons for the breakdown of the market.

382
00:23:55.221 --> 00:24:00.221
One of the reasons why the market seized up in the last year or two is because,

383
00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:05.420
or the law,
you know last year is because when you buy a stock,
like the land,

384
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.691
you know,

385
00:24:05.691 --> 00:24:09.500
somebody has to give the money and the other guy has to give back the stock and

386
00:24:09.501 --> 00:24:13.370
you know the people buying and selling or not actually meeting each other and

387
00:24:13.371 --> 00:24:17.960
you know,
simultaneously transferring money for the ownership of the land.

388
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:18.851
You know,
one guy,

389
00:24:18.851 --> 00:24:21.920
he's in San Francisco and the other guys in New York and they're doing it

390
00:24:21.921 --> 00:24:23.840
through some screen or something.

391
00:24:23.841 --> 00:24:26.180
So the physical asset isn't quite changing hands.

392
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:28.340
So you have to make a convention about,
you know,

393
00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.130
when do you say the deal has actually concluded?

394
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:36.110
So the convention is that we always use is that if you buy the land at time zero

395
00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:37.910
you don't get the dividends at time.

396
00:24:37.911 --> 00:24:41.900
T if you buy the land at time t you don't start getting the dividends until time

397
00:24:41.901 --> 00:24:42.770
t plus one.

398
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:48.310
So if the young generation buys the land at time one,

399
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.120
they don't get the dividend until starting at time two.

400
00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:58.150
So the very first dividend at time one is going to go to the old guy at time

401
00:24:58.341 --> 00:25:02.240
one,
which I had left out here.
So the old guy does get a dividend.

402
00:25:02.241 --> 00:25:06.470
It's the dividend at time one cause he began owning the land so he had it
before.

403
00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.930
So he gets that piece of land.
He can even,
he,

404
00:25:08.931 --> 00:25:11.900
even though he's selling the land at time one,

405
00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.870
he still gets the dividend at time one.

406
00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:19.010
And but generation that bought at at time on doesn't start getting dividends

407
00:25:19.011 --> 00:25:23.180
until time too.
So I was an excellent question and it was an oversight of mine,

408
00:25:23.181 --> 00:25:27.800
so exactly right.
Um,
okay.
And that's how it happens in real life.

409
00:25:27.801 --> 00:25:28.511
Of course,
you know,
the,

410
00:25:28.511 --> 00:25:32.660
the length of time might be three days or it might be one month or depends on

411
00:25:32.661 --> 00:25:35.500
the security,
what the settlement rules are.
But,
uh,

412
00:25:35.501 --> 00:25:38.780
there's always gotta be a break between when you buy the stuff and when you

413
00:25:38.781 --> 00:25:40.790
start getting the dividends because,
you know,

414
00:25:40.791 --> 00:25:45.350
it just takes time for the whole physical process to happen.
So in,
in,
uh,

415
00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.390
in the settlement for,

416
00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:52.400
so they say t plus three is a very common kind of settlement or t plus one that

417
00:25:52.401 --> 00:25:54.830
means,
you know,
in three days or in one day.

418
00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.460
And so if you're desperate for cash and you have to give up.
So anyway,

419
00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:59.450
I won't get into,

420
00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:02.390
we'll come back to this when we talk about the crisis and what happened,

421
00:26:02.391 --> 00:26:05.600
but okay.
So people who are desperate to get stuff,
you know,

422
00:26:05.601 --> 00:26:10.370
it doesn't start coming for a little while,
so,
okay.
Any other questions?
Yes.

423
00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:15.893
<v 1>Should I what?</v>

424
00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.033
<v 2>Absolutely.</v>

425
00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.593
<v 1>Okay.</v>

426
00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.900
<v 2>Very good.
Okay.
Any other comments?</v>

427
00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:41.870
All right.
Now how do you solve this?
Well,
let's figure out how to solve this.

428
00:26:41.871 --> 00:26:46.871
So the first thing you can notice is that as Fisher never thought of having

429
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:51.540
infinite time and thought about social sec,
maybe thought about social security.

430
00:26:51.541 --> 00:26:54.030
I'm not aware that he had any thoughts about social security,

431
00:26:54.031 --> 00:26:56.490
but he thought we didn't have social security,

432
00:26:56.491 --> 00:26:58.170
so it's unlikely he had been thinking about it.

433
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.770
So I don't think he thought about time going on forever.

434
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:06.980
But that doesn't mean his methods aren't.
He died by the way,
in 19,
uh,

435
00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:09.810
47 I think.
Something like that.

436
00:27:09.811 --> 00:27:12.510
So right around the time I'll lay wrote his paper.

437
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.180
So what is it that um,

438
00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:20.310
what is it that uh,
he said all his lessons are going to hold true.

439
00:27:20.311 --> 00:27:25.230
The first thing he said is that look in every period there's a queue there

440
00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.830
accused on every uh,

441
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:32.630
side of things here or cutie cutie cutie plus one key t plus one QT plus one.

442
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:38.120
So a few just double if there's no loss in generality by taking all the cuties

443
00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:39.991
to be one.

444
00:27:39.991 --> 00:27:43.140
We have no theory of inflation yet because there's no money or anything.

445
00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:46.890
So you might as well assume are measuring everything in terms of apples and take

446
00:27:46.891 --> 00:27:51.060
QT to be one.
So without loss of generality,
as they say,

447
00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:55.880
you know,
QT is equal to one.
And of course that means we have to,

448
00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.290
we can divide every equation by QT.

449
00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:01.950
So Pi t divided by QT would go here and we'd have a one and a one.

450
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:05.460
We divide this one by Qt plus one.
Still,
it's an equation.

451
00:28:05.461 --> 00:28:08.310
We have z less than or equal to one plus Pi.

452
00:28:08.311 --> 00:28:12.150
People swollen over Q t plus one plus one times one times theta.

453
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:16.800
So we just,
we normalize all the prices.
Okay,

454
00:28:16.801 --> 00:28:18.240
so renormalize

455
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:23.020
all nominal prices.

456
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.860
Uh,
in terms of apples,

457
00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:41.570
okay,
so one simplifying things as we can get rid of the soul.
Think of Pi.

458
00:28:41.571 --> 00:28:44.000
T is the price of land in terms of apples.

459
00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:48.830
So we just get rid of all the cues here.
Just assume that they're one.

460
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:54.380
And so we have this equation,
okay.
And now that means that Pi ti,

461
00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:01.420
<v 0>why is pi ti equals price of land at time t</v>

462
00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:09.600
in terms
of apples at time t.

463
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:19.550
<v 2>Okay,
so that was a normalization we did many times before we said that,
you know,</v>

464
00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:22.130
we might as well assume the contemporaneous price.

465
00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.700
We can't figure out what inflation is.
So let's figure that there's no inflation.

466
00:29:25.701 --> 00:29:28.130
The price of apples is always one and therefore,

467
00:29:28.131 --> 00:29:30.860
and we're going to measure the price of land in terms of apples.

468
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:33.680
So he got the same equation that now looks a lot simpler.

469
00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:36.080
So the cues you don't have to really worry about.

470
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.670
We're just worrying about the pies.
Everything.
Period.

471
00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.010
<v 0>Okay.
So how</v>

472
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:46.030
<v 2>did,
what did Fisher say to do?
So we've got to worry about you.</v>

473
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.550
What did Fisher say to do?
What was his,

474
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:51.820
whenever you have an economy of stock market economy like this,

475
00:29:51.821 --> 00:29:52.900
what did he say to do?

476
00:29:56.550 --> 00:30:01.320
What was his advice?
He said,
turn it into general equilibrium.
How?

477
00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:09.110
By doing what?
Yup.
Okay.

478
00:30:09.111 --> 00:30:11.970
So Fisher said Fisher's lesson,

479
00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:22.470
forget about,
forget about assets.

480
00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:30.610
Bye.
Pudding white pudding.
Their dividends,

481
00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:35.470
<v 1>dividends</v>

482
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:40.170
<v 2>into the endowments.</v>

483
00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:44.880
That's his first lesson is you see,
this is gonna.

484
00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:47.790
This is a good summary of what we've learned so far in a second.

485
00:30:47.791 --> 00:30:50.850
Last time was look at present value prices.

486
00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:02.840
Okay?
So he says,
forget all these pies and things like that.

487
00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.360
Just look at the present value.

488
00:31:05.361 --> 00:31:10.250
So we're looking at p one p two p three.
Dot,
dot.
Dot.

489
00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.050
We're a PT

490
00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:15.393
<v 1>price.</v>

491
00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:21.600
<v 0>Uh,
at times at time,
you know,
zero let's say,</v>

492
00:31:21.601 --> 00:31:25.860
or time one,
doesn't matter.
Price at time.
One of,

493
00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.520
uh,
an apple at time t.

494
00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:33.730
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

495
00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:35.800
<v 2>So once you knew the presence of the endowment,</v>

496
00:31:35.801 --> 00:31:38.920
then I'm not going to write all this.
The endowment of all generations,

497
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:42.310
one and above is stays the same.
Three,
one,
three,
one,
three,
one.

498
00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:47.290
But the endowment of generations zero is now one,
one,
one,
one,
one,

499
00:31:47.291 --> 00:31:48.400
one,
one forever.

500
00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:53.820
And the budget's said everybody's going to have a budget set determined by the

501
00:31:53.821 --> 00:31:54.654
peas.

502
00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:57.760
<v 1>Okay?</v>

503
00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.940
<v 2>Okay,
so now we're just one step from solving this.</v>

504
00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:06.190
So there's one more thing to notice before we can solve it.

505
00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:07.930
So by symmetry,

506
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:11.600
<v 0>so observe</v>

507
00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:17.060
that by symmetry.

508
00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:20.360
We can hope

509
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:24.500
to find an equilibrium

510
00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:31.610
equilibrium with

511
00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:34.520
PT

512
00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:38.840
plus won over PT,

513
00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:43.500
<v 2>e p a constant.</v>

514
00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:52.410
Okay,
so you know,
every generation is the same.

515
00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:57.120
The only relevant price for a generation is the trade off between the price of

516
00:32:57.121 --> 00:32:59.280
goods when they're young and the price of goods when they're old.

517
00:32:59.281 --> 00:33:02.100
That's what Fisher said.
The veil of the,

518
00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:06.360
of the stock market is just a means of transferring wealth between when you're

519
00:33:06.361 --> 00:33:09.510
young and when you're old.
And really you should calculate.

520
00:33:09.511 --> 00:33:12.750
All these guys have to calculate,
if I buy the stock now when I'm young,

521
00:33:12.751 --> 00:33:15.630
it's going to cost me a certain amount of money and I'm going to be able to get

522
00:33:15.631 --> 00:33:18.210
a return.
So the real rate of return,

523
00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:25.110
right,
that they're all going to calculate is going to equal,
well,

524
00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:28.140
they're going to by putting in Pi Ti dollars today,

525
00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:33.500
they get out Pie t plus one plus the dividend one tomorrow,

526
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:39.240
right?
So tomorrow they're going to get Pied t plus one plus one.
So for every,

527
00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:42.440
if they,
if they put in buy one share of stock,

528
00:33:42.441 --> 00:33:44.880
it cost them piety and tomorrow they get,
you know,

529
00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:48.750
patty apples when measuring in terms of apples and in the future they get pie t

530
00:33:48.751 --> 00:33:52.530
plus one plus one apple in the future.
So that's the real rate of return.

531
00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:57.180
That's like one plus r one plus r t.
Okay.
But we've,

532
00:33:57.181 --> 00:33:59.130
we're going to assume that that's a constant one.

533
00:33:59.131 --> 00:34:02.580
Plus r we're going to guess it's a constant and that's,
you know,

534
00:34:02.581 --> 00:34:07.581
just one over this p that I told you about before the ratio PT plus one,

535
00:34:08.101 --> 00:34:10.860
the present value.
So the the,
the,

536
00:34:10.861 --> 00:34:15.570
this ratio is just the they interest rate between time,
t and time.

537
00:34:15.571 --> 00:34:16.410
T plus one.

538
00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:20.580
So Fisher says you don't have to think about all the stock market and what the

539
00:34:20.581 --> 00:34:23.370
return on the stock market and all that's going to be really,

540
00:34:23.371 --> 00:34:25.710
you're just trading off by doing all that calculation.

541
00:34:25.711 --> 00:34:29.400
You're figuring out what's the trade off between time t goods and time t plus

542
00:34:29.401 --> 00:34:32.640
one goods in the Fisher economy.
You don't look at the stock market,

543
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:36.480
you assume that everybody knows the present value prices and therefore the

544
00:34:36.481 --> 00:34:38.870
tradeoff between time t and time t plus one goods.

545
00:34:38.871 --> 00:34:42.210
And we're going to assume that's a constant because the thing so symmetric,

546
00:34:42.211 --> 00:34:44.160
how else could it turned out except to constant.

547
00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:47.160
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

548
00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.900
<v 2>Okay,
so now we're ready to solve it.</v>

549
00:34:48.901 --> 00:34:51.870
We've done all the tricks almost to solve it.

550
00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:55.170
So what is an equilibrium going to be?

551
00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:58.413
<v 1>Okay,</v>

552
00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.800
<v 2>so here's the equilibrium is going to be a very simple equation.</v>

553
00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:07.903
<v 1>Okay?</v>

554
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.440
<v 2>At every generation you're going to have an old and a young.</v>

555
00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:16.240
So what is the total supply of goods and every generation,

556
00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:22.150
how much goods are there?
There's one for the old apple,

557
00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.650
right?
If you look at any generation like this one at time two,
there's that one.

558
00:35:28.651 --> 00:35:31.230
No,
not that one.
Little less.
The one in the middle,

559
00:35:31.231 --> 00:35:35.310
that's the one for the old guy.
Then there's the young guy who has three,

560
00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:40.920
right?
And then the apple that the land produces.

561
00:35:40.921 --> 00:35:42.690
So this is young apples

562
00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:46.960
and this is the dividend

563
00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:55.040
of apples.
So that's how many apples there are in the economy.

564
00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:58.580
So who's going to be eating them?
Well,

565
00:35:58.581 --> 00:36:02.330
there's going to be an old guy eating apples and there's going to be a young guy

566
00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:08.060
eating apples.
So how much is the old guy going to eat?
Well,

567
00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:12.350
the,
the uh,
old guys going to spend half as money.

568
00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:15.740
And how much money does he have?
Well,
from his point of view,

569
00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.550
he's just trading off when he's young,
against when he's old.

570
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:21.530
So from his point of view,

571
00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:26.240
he's got three apples wanting to young plus one apple.
One,
he's old.

572
00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:30.980
But that's worth to him the tradeoff between apples when he's young and when

573
00:36:30.981 --> 00:36:32.150
he's old,
it's just given by

574
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:33.083
<v 1>p.</v>

575
00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:39.670
<v 2>Okay.
Divided by P.
I tell this,
this is the whole trick.</v>

576
00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:44.890
Okay?
So we have to spend a minute.
So this dawns on Ui,
this is true.

577
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:48.940
And now what's the young going to do?
The young generation,
what's their income?

578
00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:52.510
Well,
they only care about the trade off between prices.

579
00:36:52.511 --> 00:36:55.810
One when they're young and when they're old.
Okay?

580
00:36:55.811 --> 00:36:57.490
So when they're young and when they're old,

581
00:36:57.790 --> 00:36:59.870
they don't care about land according to Fisher.

582
00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:02.380
They don't have to think about that.
They just have to know the price,

583
00:37:02.381 --> 00:37:06.880
which we're assuming is p for everybody.
The trade off between young apples,

584
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:10.060
which are worth more than old apples.
So old.
Okay.

585
00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:14.590
So to them they have the same income.
Three plus one p,

586
00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.650
you know these peas referred to different time periods,

587
00:37:17.651 --> 00:37:21.370
but we're assuming the same.
Here's the young,
this is the young.

588
00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:22.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

589
00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.350
<v 2>Yeah,
this is the young,
so this is divided by one.
So this is the young,</v>

590
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.470
and this is the old.
And once I solved this equation,

591
00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:38.490
we'll have the whole equilibrium.
But we'd need to understand this equation.

592
00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:41.610
So where did I get this equation?
Okay,

593
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:45.750
so let's take any time period to like t equals two for example,

594
00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:50.370
we know the total apples around that can be eaten or five that's on the right

595
00:37:50.371 --> 00:37:53.040
hand side.
The old guys,
apple,
the young guys,

596
00:37:53.041 --> 00:37:57.360
three apples and the the land producing one apple,

597
00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:00.990
five apples and all know who's going to be eating the apples.

598
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:04.740
They're going to be old guys and they're going to be young guys eating apples.

599
00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:09.120
So the old will be the generation one guys,

600
00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:13.020
they're going to be eating apples and then the generation two guys are going to

601
00:38:13.021 --> 00:38:16.650
be eating apples.
Now the generation two people,

602
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:18.690
they've got three apples at time two,

603
00:38:18.691 --> 00:38:21.900
so they're looking at three but they've got expectations in their head.

604
00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:23.130
They're going to think ahead,

605
00:38:23.131 --> 00:38:26.760
what's the price of stock market today versus tomorrow?
Fisher says,
okay.

606
00:38:26.761 --> 00:38:27.870
They do all that thinking.

607
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:33.080
They realize the tradeoff between PR consumption at time t when they're young

608
00:38:33.421 --> 00:38:36.820
and consumption.
When time t plus one,
they're old.
That's given by the price.

609
00:38:36.821 --> 00:38:41.020
P we've assumed there's a price p so they're going to say to themselves,
okay,

610
00:38:41.021 --> 00:38:43.870
I've got three apples when I'm young.
One Apple.
One I'm old.

611
00:38:43.871 --> 00:38:46.000
It's not worth the same in present value terms.

612
00:38:46.001 --> 00:38:50.560
It's just three plus one p cause the old apple is not worth as much at time t as

613
00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:51.071
it is at time.

614
00:38:51.071 --> 00:38:55.300
T plus one is three plus one p I'm going to spend half of my income and the

615
00:38:55.301 --> 00:38:57.880
price when I'm young.
I've assumed that's one.
Okay,

616
00:38:57.881 --> 00:39:00.730
so that's what the younger doing.
The old guys now,

617
00:39:00.731 --> 00:39:04.900
the old guys with their doing at time t depended on what they did when they were

618
00:39:04.901 --> 00:39:09.901
young but when they were young at time one they knew there was a trade off

619
00:39:10.271 --> 00:39:13.000
between time one and time two apples,

620
00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.530
but we've assumed it's the same price trade offs.

621
00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:19.630
We've assumed it's the same p and so they did the same calculation when they

622
00:39:19.631 --> 00:39:21.580
were young.
They were going to spend half their money.

623
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:24.970
This je t'aime one generation is going to have spent half its money when it's

624
00:39:24.971 --> 00:39:29.200
young half its present value when young,
okay divided by.

625
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:30.910
So when they're young they're going to,

626
00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:32.740
they're going to do that when there are old.

627
00:39:32.741 --> 00:39:36.160
Now they're looking forward to spending half their present value.

628
00:39:36.161 --> 00:39:40.120
When they're old and the price of old of apples when they're old is given by p

629
00:39:40.121 --> 00:39:41.350
relative to when they're young.

630
00:39:41.351 --> 00:39:45.760
So they're gonna spend one half times the present value of their income divided

631
00:39:45.761 --> 00:39:49.390
by the present value of the price of the old apple,

632
00:39:49.391 --> 00:39:52.360
which is the apple we're talking about because there are consuming when they're

633
00:39:52.361 --> 00:39:56.020
old now.
So their consumption plus this consumption equals five.

634
00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:59.230
Now at least half of you must be baffled.

635
00:39:59.231 --> 00:40:04.000
So ask me a question to see if we can get to the bottom of this.
That's it.

636
00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:06.340
That's the whole equation.
As soon as we solve this,

637
00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:10.810
we'll figure out all the prices and everything in the whole economy.
And uh,

638
00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:14.470
so we're at the end.
But this is our,
this requires a little bit of thought.

639
00:40:14.471 --> 00:40:15.880
So go ahead.

640
00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:25.753
No.

641
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.320
<v 3>Okay.</v>

642
00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.520
<v 2>Okay.
The dividend,
that's a good question.</v>

643
00:40:29.521 --> 00:40:32.240
And the dividend fit in here because yes,
there's a dividend.

644
00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:34.250
Here's the dividend that got produced.

645
00:40:34.251 --> 00:40:39.080
So there's an apple to be eaten from the dividend.
Okay.
Right now you're saying,

646
00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:44.510
so it's very important question you're asking.
So it's correct what I wrote,
but,

647
00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:46.700
but it doesn't sound correct.
So what he's saying,

648
00:40:46.701 --> 00:40:49.490
the question is what happened to the dividend?
This guy,

649
00:40:49.491 --> 00:40:53.720
this generation save this young generation,
either one.

650
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:56.540
This save the old generation,
the old generation,

651
00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:59.210
when they were young at time one,

652
00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:02.600
they bought land looking forward to their old age.

653
00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.060
They sold the land and they got the dividend.

654
00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:08.720
How come that's not factoring in to their demand?

655
00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.090
That's his question.
Right?
Okay.

656
00:41:11.091 --> 00:41:15.410
The answer is because that's precisely the point of what Fisher did.

657
00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.720
Fisher said yes.
And the real world,

658
00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:20.690
everybody is thinking to themselves like generation one,

659
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:24.440
I'm young now on buying the land because when I get older I'll be able to resell

660
00:41:24.441 --> 00:41:29.270
it and also get the dividend.
But Fischer has thought ahead,
Fisher saying,

661
00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:32.030
okay,
if the guy's going to think about pikey t plus one,

662
00:41:32.031 --> 00:41:35.780
that's what will be able to sell land for and he's going to think about the

663
00:41:35.781 --> 00:41:40.781
dividend is going to get okay and his rate of return is therefore divided by how

664
00:41:41.301 --> 00:41:44.240
much he had to pay for the land today.
That's his rate of return.
But see,

665
00:41:44.241 --> 00:41:48.200
the top thing is how many,
the bottom thing is how many apples he had to give up.

666
00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:51.920
Pie Key there is how many apples he had to give up to get the land.

667
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:57.620
The numerator is how many apples he gets next period after selling the land and

668
00:41:57.621 --> 00:41:58.490
taking the dividend.

669
00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:03.850
So that ratio is the tradeoff between apples today and apples in the future for

670
00:42:03.921 --> 00:42:06.860
him.
So if he says to himself with Fisher says,

671
00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.430
the only thing the guy cares about is that ratio that trade off,

672
00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.880
which we're calling p one over P,
that's the trade off.

673
00:42:13.881 --> 00:42:17.300
He's going to have his in his mind.
Okay,
and so

674
00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:22.360
what is his income?
This guy began with no land.
You know,

675
00:42:22.361 --> 00:42:23.920
only zero began with the land.

676
00:42:23.921 --> 00:42:28.921
Everybody else buys the land only as a means of getting to more consumption when

677
00:42:28.961 --> 00:42:29.794
they're old.

678
00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:34.630
So the whole point of fishers insight is you don't have to keep track of how the

679
00:42:34.631 --> 00:42:37.690
guys managing to get the payoff when he's old.

680
00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:43.350
All he's doing is he's recognizing a trade off of one plus R or one over p that

681
00:42:44.171 --> 00:42:46.240
trade off between consumption when young consumption,

682
00:42:46.241 --> 00:42:48.220
when old and all he can do is turn his concern,

683
00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:53.110
his endowment when he's young into more endowment and he's old at that ratio and

684
00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:56.380
it doesn't matter how he does it as long as we have the right ratio.

685
00:42:56.650 --> 00:42:58.510
So Fisher says forget about the assets,

686
00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.840
just keep track of the present value prices.

687
00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:06.370
And these will tell you the ratio of transformation of goods when young to when

688
00:43:06.371 --> 00:43:08.440
old.
And that's all you need to know to make a decision.

689
00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:12.100
It's the whole point of Fisher says you don't need to think about the SSI.

690
00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:16.030
After we get the PS,
we'll go back and figure out what the price of land is.

691
00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:21.180
<v 3>Any other questions?
Yes.</v>

692
00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:25.720
<v 1>Wait again.
Second.</v>

693
00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:34.120
<v 2>Yes,
because I,
I'm taking p as the ratio.</v>

694
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:36.460
So p this PE

695
00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.013
<v 3>is here.</v>

696
00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:45.020
<v 2>So it says if I had one apple at time t how many apples could I get at time?</v>

697
00:43:46.771 --> 00:43:47.790
T plus one

698
00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:50.250
<v 3>p of them because</v>

699
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:53.450
<v 2>right cause this ratio.
So for every apple I have down here,</v>

700
00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:58.400
I can get p apples at time,
t plus one.
So that ratio is the only thing that,

701
00:43:58.401 --> 00:43:59.570
so I might as well call,

702
00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:03.590
you know if the ratio of two prices as p it doesn't matter what their levels
are.

703
00:44:03.591 --> 00:44:06.350
So I might as well think of one of them has one and the other one was p.

704
00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:09.860
I could think of the first one is two and the second one is to p.

705
00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:13.590
That would be the same thing.
Right?

706
00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:16.500
So far I thought of the first prices too.

707
00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:20.680
And this price is to p I put it to here or to here and a two here and it

708
00:44:20.681 --> 00:44:21.760
wouldn't change anything.

709
00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:24.383
<v 3>So remember</v>

710
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:28.450
<v 2>we learned this the very,
this is why the lessons of general equilibrium,</v>

711
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:31.440
they seem so obvious and then you put them in a slightly different context and

712
00:44:31.441 --> 00:44:32.310
you realize how clever

713
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:36.510
<v 0>Fisher was.
If you double all the prices,
you're not going to change anything.</v>

714
00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.670
It's the price ratios that matter.

715
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:42.420
So it's the trade off between apples when young and apples,
when old that matter.

716
00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:44.590
If you assume that trade off is given by P,

717
00:44:44.591 --> 00:44:48.030
you might as well as soon that the first guy for all we care,

718
00:44:48.031 --> 00:44:52.620
he might as well as soon that he's measuring the prices when he's young in terms

719
00:44:52.621 --> 00:44:55.470
of one and the prices when he's old in terms of p.

720
00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.540
Okay,
those were very good questions.
It's a little confusing,

721
00:45:02.541 --> 00:45:06.230
but when we go back to the original equilibrium,
you'll,
you'll,

722
00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.180
it'll be clearer I thing,

723
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:13.430
but so that's the only equation that we have to satisfy so we can solve that

724
00:45:13.431 --> 00:45:15.800
equation now.
Any other questions?

725
00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:22.523
<v 1>Okay.</v>

726
00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:26.800
<v 0>Okay.
Let's solve that equation.
That equation is,</v>

727
00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:31.900
I'm going to multiply by two P so I'm going to get 10 p on the right hand side

728
00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:35.810
might cause if I multiply by two P I get five times two PS,

729
00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:37.450
10 p on the left hand side,

730
00:45:37.451 --> 00:45:42.451
I'm just going to get three plus one p plus a three p plus p squared.

731
00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:52.200
Okay?
And so if I multiply it,
you know,
I rearrange,
I just get p squared.

732
00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:56.250
Oh my usual problems here.

733
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:59.940
P squared minus six P plus three equals zero

734
00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:07.460
p squared minus six p plus three equals zero.

735
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:12.140
So p equals six plus.
And I'm using the quadratic formula,

736
00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:15.200
which you might have two,
which I assume you know,

737
00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:18.160
minus B squared minus four.
Okay,

738
00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:23.180
so six squared minus four times one times three minus 12 over two which equals

739
00:46:24.681 --> 00:46:29.681
six minus the square root of 24 over two.

740
00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:31.683
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

741
00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:35.870
<v 0>So the square root of 24 is a little bit less than five.</v>

742
00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:39.020
So this is going to be a little bit more than one.
Uh,
sorry,

743
00:46:39.021 --> 00:46:42.950
a little bit less than five.
So this will be a little bit more than one.

744
00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:47.060
So the whole thing will be a little bit more than a half.
So let's say it's 0.55.

745
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:53.050
Okay?
Now how did I know?
Okay,
so here's a crucial step.

746
00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:58.120
How did I know when I said six plus or minus?
Why did they take the minus?

747
00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:03.160
Because if I had taken six plus this,
I would've gotten a gigantic,

748
00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.930
well,
let's come back to that.
Okay.

749
00:47:04.931 --> 00:47:07.940
So how did I know to take six minus that instead of six plus the,

750
00:47:07.941 --> 00:47:10.720
so if this is the p and what are the prices,

751
00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:15.070
what are fishers prices we've just solved for equilibrium and these prices are

752
00:47:15.071 --> 00:47:17.980
going to be point.
Uh,
you know,

753
00:47:17.981 --> 00:47:22.981
we call this one one maybe 0.5 5.55 squared.

754
00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:28.540
Point five five Q Saturday.

755
00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:33.420
That's Fisher says the prices are
okay and we can connect.

756
00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.910
We can now figure out everybody's consumption.
Y and z.

757
00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:39.280
What's why going to equal,

758
00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:43.270
why is this thing on the right one half three plus one piece.

759
00:47:43.271 --> 00:47:48.271
So it's 3.55 divided by two so that's a 1.775 okay.

760
00:47:52.991 --> 00:47:57.640
And what's z?
You should check,
I'm going a little fast here for myself.

761
00:47:57.641 --> 00:48:02.410
Three plus 3.55 divided by two is 1.775.

762
00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:07.120
So what is z?
It's going to be one and a half plus.

763
00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:12.360
No,
it's,
it's,
it's 3.5 call.

764
00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:18.140
It's a 3.5 divided by 1.13.

765
00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:25.500
Okay.
P is 0.5.
I'm going to fast for you.

766
00:48:25.501 --> 00:48:29.100
A Hug P is 0.55 right?
I just got p.

767
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:32.490
So if I want to see now go back to consumption.

768
00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:36.030
What's the consumption going to be when you're young?
It's going to be,

769
00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:41.480
y is going to be three plus 0.55 divided by two which equals that three three

770
00:48:45.481 --> 00:48:49.190
points,
right?
Three plus 0.55 that's the guy's income.

771
00:48:49.191 --> 00:48:53.190
And he consumes a half when he's young,
that's 1.775.

772
00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:54.780
And when he's old,

773
00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:01.040
he's going to have the same income.
Uh,

774
00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:04.640
so 1.775 divided by p.

775
00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:06.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

776
00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:07.121
<v 0>Which is,</v>

777
00:49:07.121 --> 00:49:12.121
so it's going to be 1.775 divided by 0.55.

778
00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:19.390
Okay.
And that
you can see,

779
00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:25.320
uh,
no,
that doesn't look right.
Uh,
divide,
not divide by point.
Yeah.

780
00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:30.280
1.7 that divided by p and that's going to be a little bit more than three.

781
00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.590
And so in fact,
if you solve it out,

782
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:37.690
it turns out to be 3.225.

783
00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:44.980
Okay.
Did I go too fast there?
So I'm just solving,
I'm plugging in 0.55 there.

784
00:49:44.981 --> 00:49:48.010
So it's 3.55 divided by half.

785
00:49:48.011 --> 00:49:51.430
That was that number 1.775 divided by P,

786
00:49:51.431 --> 00:49:56.230
which is 0.55 so you can see it's a little bit more than three because 0.55 and

787
00:49:56.231 --> 00:49:59.320
to 1.7 as you know,
a little bit more than three.
In fact,

788
00:49:59.321 --> 00:50:01.960
if you solve it out to some decimal places,
it's that.

789
00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:10.590
Okay,
so we've solved what everybody does,
everybody.

790
00:50:10.591 --> 00:50:12.150
Now we know what everyone's going to do.

791
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:17.390
The young are going to spend 1.775 are going to consume 1.775 uh,

792
00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:26.550
they're going to consume 1.775 here they have an endowment of three apples are

793
00:50:26.551 --> 00:50:28.030
not going to eat them all three only

794
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.890
<v 2>consume 1.775 of them.
Okay,</v>

795
00:50:30.891 --> 00:50:34.160
and what are they going to do with the and then the old at the same time,

796
00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:35.330
what are they doing?

797
00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:40.480
They're consuming 3.2 to five but you notice that those things add up to five.

798
00:50:40.791 --> 00:50:44.510
So the consumption when the young plus the consumption when they're old.
Okay?

799
00:50:44.511 --> 00:50:49.511
So the consumption of this old guy there is 3.225 and you add the consumption of

800
00:50:49.741 --> 00:50:50.660
that?
Yeah,
I went to high.

801
00:50:50.661 --> 00:50:55.490
Their consumption of the young guy just under him is 1.775 the two of the mat up

802
00:50:55.491 --> 00:50:57.890
to five that exactly clear as the market.

803
00:50:57.891 --> 00:51:01.940
So what time to you repeat the same thing at time three et cetera.

804
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:04.460
So,
um,

805
00:51:06.590 --> 00:51:06.950
<v 1>yeah.</v>

806
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:07.341
<v 2>Okay.</v>

807
00:51:07.341 --> 00:51:11.150
So you see we've already cleared all the markets except the one at time one,

808
00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:13.640
which looks more complicated.
But we've,

809
00:51:13.641 --> 00:51:17.240
we've cleared all the markets now what's the price of a land going to be?

810
00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:23.460
What's the price of land?
What to write that?
Let's write it here.

811
00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:28.680
What's the price of land?
Which is going to be a constant.

812
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:29.910
How do we figure that out?

813
00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.370
Howard Fisher say you've figured out the price of land.

814
00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:41.430
So the price of land at time ones say,
what would the fishers say?

815
00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:43.133
<v 1>Yup.</v>

816
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:51.150
<v 2>That's one way of getting it.
Okay,
so what would he,
what's he paying for it?</v>

817
00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:52.433
<v 1>Oh,</v>

818
00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:56.290
<v 2>right.
So from this equation,</v>

819
00:51:56.291 --> 00:52:01.291
he spent 3.7 he spent 1.775 his income was three so what's leftover?

820
00:52:07.210 --> 00:52:08.000
<v 1>Okay,</v>

821
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.830
<v 2>what did he spend on land,
therefore?</v>

822
00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:11.750
<v 1>Oh,</v>

823
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:14.510
<v 2>so the price of land has to be 1.225.</v>

824
00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:18.380
Now that's not the way Fisher suggest and finding out the price of land.

825
00:52:18.381 --> 00:52:19.670
What did he say you should do?

826
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:24.680
What's the fundamental theorem and what is that?

827
00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:26.143
<v 1>Wow,</v>

828
00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:28.890
<v 2>so the land pays one apple every period.</v>

829
00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:31.123
<v 1>Okay,</v>

830
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:37.390
<v 2>so it's paying one plus one times p squared plus one times p cubed plus one</v>

831
00:52:38.331 --> 00:52:39.680
times speed.
The fourth right?

832
00:52:39.681 --> 00:52:42.800
Because looked at from the point of view of time one you get an apple macs

833
00:52:42.801 --> 00:52:47.300
period relative to the apples today,
that's worth p an apple in two periods.

834
00:52:47.301 --> 00:52:50.630
It's worth p squared at a time.
One because you know an apple at time,

835
00:52:50.631 --> 00:52:54.710
one at time two is worth p apples at time one and worth p squared.

836
00:52:54.711 --> 00:52:56.900
Apples at times zero.
So you just keep doing this.

837
00:52:57.350 --> 00:53:00.800
But this is a perpetuity and so therefore it's equal to,

838
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:05.503
<v 1>okay,</v>

839
00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:09.930
<v 2>yeah,
one over R.
Okay.
And we didn't.
So it's equal to one over R.</v>

840
00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:15.330
Okay.
And so what's our,
so we know that w so what's our,

841
00:53:15.331 --> 00:53:16.830
how do we figure out what our is?

842
00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:19.853
<v 1>So what</v>

843
00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:24.810
<v 2>one over one plus r equals p,
right equals 0.5.</v>

844
00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:32.480
<v 0>So therefore one plus r equals one over 0.55 and r equals won over 0.55 minus a</v>

845
00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:39.483
one.

846
00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:47.930
<v 2>Okay.
And so this is a little less than two minus one is going to be like</v>

847
00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:50.850
<v 0>0.81 or something.
Okay?</v>

848
00:53:50.851 --> 00:53:54.420
And you take one over 0.81 and you'd get the same number.

849
00:53:57.710 --> 00:54:02.060
<v 2>Okay?
So all right,
so that's how fish.
So let's go back to,</v>

850
00:54:02.061 --> 00:54:06.260
so Fisher solved everything he said.
I mean the Fisher method solves it all.

851
00:54:06.261 --> 00:54:09.800
It says it.
Well we haven't,
well let's worry about time.

852
00:54:09.801 --> 00:54:12.950
A zero is what time one.
We haven't done that for.
So,
okay.

853
00:54:12.951 --> 00:54:16.910
So what happens every period,
every period,
like from to onwards,

854
00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:21.140
the young guy says,
uh Huh,
I've got three uh,
apples.

855
00:54:21.141 --> 00:54:23.540
What am I going to do with them?
He says to himself,
well,

856
00:54:23.541 --> 00:54:27.800
the price of land is 1.2 to five so I could,
you know,
I could,
uh,

857
00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:30.530
I could eat some of the apples or I could buy some land.

858
00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.300
And what does he decide to do?
He says,

859
00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:37.360
let me eat 1.775 apples and spend the rest of the my money buying one acre of

860
00:54:38.781 --> 00:54:41.690
land.
Now why am I doing that?
Because next period,

861
00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:46.490
I know the price of land is going to be the same 1.2 to five and I'm going to

862
00:54:46.491 --> 00:54:50.810
get a dividend of one.
So I'm going to be getting a rate of return.

863
00:54:50.811 --> 00:54:55.811
We just calculated of 81% at that rate of return of 81% so this ratio up here,

864
00:54:59.350 --> 00:55:02.090
okay,
this is another thing,
this also,

865
00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:07.600
this number is equal to 1.225 plus one divided by 1.225 k.

866
00:55:11.601 --> 00:55:16.601
That's also equal to a 1.81 remember our,

867
00:55:16.851 --> 00:55:18.530
we just calculated over here,

868
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:24.350
where did I do are ar was 81% that's the same number here.

869
00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:28.850
81% okay.
So everybody says to himself,

870
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:31.760
given that there's an 81% rate of interest,

871
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:35.540
I'm happy to pull the whole unit of land because at that rate of interest,

872
00:55:35.541 --> 00:55:37.790
I'm just trading off consumption today for consumption.

873
00:55:37.791 --> 00:55:41.750
When I'm old at the rate that I want to.
Okay.

874
00:55:41.751 --> 00:55:44.000
And at time zero the market clears also.

875
00:55:44.001 --> 00:55:47.960
So we cleared the market for every time to through infinity.
Okay.

876
00:55:47.961 --> 00:55:52.961
And that was by this equation that was up here by picking the right P,

877
00:55:53.061 --> 00:55:57.650
we know every market from t equals two onwards was clearing and Fisher would say

878
00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:00.560
by Vol Ross law,
we don't have to worry about time one.

879
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:03.530
That's going to clear as well.
And sure enough it does.

880
00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:06.920
You know it's a little bit different now it's just the old guy.

881
00:56:06.921 --> 00:56:08.330
But the old guy with his land,

882
00:56:08.331 --> 00:56:13.331
which is 1.225 pluses dividend of one is land,

883
00:56:13.941 --> 00:56:18.110
which is worth 1.2 to five and his dividend of a,

884
00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:28.230
well I wrote down the right price of land all this time.

885
00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:37.810
Oh,
that would be bad.
Um,
okay,
so the old guy,

886
00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:39.700
what does he do?
He has his,

887
00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:45.010
he has his one apple plus he has the land.
So he's going to consume

888
00:56:46.350 --> 00:56:50.700
the old guy has his,
oh I see the old guy.

889
00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:52.680
So what happens at time?
Um,

890
00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:57.270
one the old guy has his dividend that he had before.

891
00:56:57.990 --> 00:57:00.930
Okay.
So he's got the dividends of the land cause he's owned the land,
you know,

892
00:57:00.931 --> 00:57:05.340
forever.
So he gets the dividend of one plus heat.
So that's one.

893
00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:08.340
Plus he has an endowment of one.
So he's consuming too now.

894
00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:11.310
Plus he sells the land for 1.2 to five.

895
00:57:11.311 --> 00:57:15.750
So that all adds up to 3.2 to five.
And then if you add the young generations,

896
00:57:15.751 --> 00:57:19.770
1.775 that indeed clears the market at time one.

897
00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:23.760
So the market's going to clear in every single period.

898
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.780
Okay.
But we only had to solve it for periods two and onwards,

899
00:57:30.781 --> 00:57:33.870
which are all symmetric cause by Vol Ross law according to Fisher.

900
00:57:33.871 --> 00:57:38.010
Once it clears from time to onwards without even bothering to check,

901
00:57:38.011 --> 00:57:41.340
we know it would have had to work at time one and sure enough it did.

902
00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:44.610
So as I said,
let's summarize now what we've done.
Okay.

903
00:57:44.611 --> 00:57:46.140
And then we can start drawing the lesson.

904
00:57:46.141 --> 00:57:50.700
So what we did is we started with a complicated model with land and people

905
00:57:50.701 --> 00:57:53.580
having to look forward and expect what the price of land was going to be,

906
00:57:53.581 --> 00:57:55.650
depending on what the next generation wanting to hold,

907
00:57:55.651 --> 00:57:58.680
which depended on what they were gonna they were gonna think the generation of

908
00:57:58.681 --> 00:58:02.160
that we're going to hold,
et cetera.
Very complicated stuff.

909
00:58:04.850 --> 00:58:08.600
And we saw that to solve it was very simple.
You just do the Fisher thing.

910
00:58:08.601 --> 00:58:10.130
If everybody's rational,

911
00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:14.750
you can always turn everything you can forget about the acids and the land and

912
00:58:14.751 --> 00:58:19.430
turn everything into present value prices and put the endowments so you forget

913
00:58:19.431 --> 00:58:24.431
about all the assets and just put there the dividends into people's endowments

914
00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:27.470
and look at all the present value prices.
Okay.

915
00:58:27.471 --> 00:58:31.820
And the present value prices by symmetry where assuming just grow exponentially

916
00:58:31.821 --> 00:58:34.040
declined exponentially.
Okay.

917
00:58:34.041 --> 00:58:38.480
And then we could solve the one equation and figure out what that price was.

918
00:58:38.481 --> 00:58:42.730
The Ex,
the,
the,
the,
the exponential number p that's,
you know,

919
00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:45.350
to the nth power gives the enterprise as president.
Finally price.

920
00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:49.220
So solving for that p we then cleared the markets.

921
00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:51.920
We found out what everyone was going to do when young and went old.

922
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:55.540
And by plugging in now fissures formula,

923
00:58:55.550 --> 00:58:58.940
the price of every acid as the present value of its dividends.

924
00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:00.830
We figured out what the,
uh,

925
00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:03.620
we figured out what the price of land was every period.

926
00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:06.080
So we solved for the whole equilibrium and sure enough,

927
00:59:06.081 --> 00:59:09.560
it clears and enact Librium.
Everybody's doing this calculation.

928
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:13.400
If I buy land today,
I'm going to get that rate of return on the land,

929
00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:16.520
which corresponds to the pea.
It's going to be 81%

930
00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:18.150
<v 1>okay.</v>

931
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:19.500
<v 2>And so everything works out.</v>

932
00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:20.853
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

933
00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:27.210
<v 2>Okay.
So what's this got to do with social security?</v>

934
00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:30.140
There are any questions about this?
I,
I,
I,

935
00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:33.060
I sense a little bit of puzzlement still.

936
00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:38.340
You shouldn't be that far away from understanding it.
So let's hear a question.

937
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:46.280
What don't you understand?
Just point to an equation you don't understand.

938
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:48.740
Yes.
Good.
Brave of you.

939
00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:50.113
<v 1>How do we show that?</v>

940
00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:56.620
<v 2>Okay,
so Fisher says that,
uh,</v>

941
00:59:57.190 --> 01:00:01.240
the way I solved it is I ignored the assets so I didn't pay attention to what

942
01:00:01.241 --> 01:00:03.730
the assets were.
I just put the dividends in the endowment.

943
01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:08.260
I didn't pay any attention to what people were holding of the assets because

944
01:00:08.261 --> 01:00:10.270
Fisher says forget the acids all together,

945
01:00:10.271 --> 01:00:13.330
just do the present value prices and augment the endowments.

946
01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:18.160
And I found the present value prices by getting this factor p and then it was

947
01:00:18.161 --> 01:00:21.340
just Peter the end and I found what everyone was going to consume.

948
01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:24.640
That was it as far as Fisher's concern.
But then Fisher says,
okay,

949
01:00:24.641 --> 01:00:26.500
once we found general equilibrium,

950
01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:31.270
we can go back to financial equilibrium and figure out what the price of land

951
01:00:31.271 --> 01:00:35.440
is,
which is uh,
the present value of the dividends.

952
01:00:35.441 --> 01:00:39.520
So it's price is 1.2,
two,
five and the step I left out,

953
01:00:39.521 --> 01:00:40.510
which you're asking about,

954
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:45.490
you can also figure out what assets everybody's holding.
So Fisher saying,

955
01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:50.230
okay,
what assets are they holding while the guy,
you know,
he's spending,

956
01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.870
he's consuming 1.7,
seven five here.

957
01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:56.320
We figured out the price there of 1.225

958
01:00:57.900 --> 01:00:58.190
<v 1>okay,</v>

959
01:00:58.190 --> 01:01:01.160
<v 2>so it must be that he's holding exactly one unit of the asset.</v>

960
01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:03.470
And so the asset market is clearing too,

961
01:01:03.471 --> 01:01:06.200
but that's no accident Fisher saying if you,

962
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:10.760
if you clear all the markets doing the present value,
general equilibrium stuff,

963
01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:13.070
and he'd go back to the financial equilibrium,

964
01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:17.120
you're automatically going to be clearing all those markets too.
So I did.

965
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:20.900
I left out the step that you don't once.
It's because somebody's,

966
01:01:21.090 --> 01:01:25.400
somebody's anticipated all that and got me to calculate the price of one and a

967
01:01:25.401 --> 01:01:28.130
cheating way.
He said,
assumes they as one,

968
01:01:28.131 --> 01:01:30.170
then figure out how much money you're spending on the acid.

969
01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:32.000
What I should've done.
So he did that.

970
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:36.020
What I should've done is done Fisher's track of figuring out the price of the

971
01:01:36.021 --> 01:01:37.910
asset,
which is 1.2 to five.

972
01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:42.560
And then of course we know the guy must've bought one asset mortar to use up his

973
01:01:42.561 --> 01:01:45.500
budget set,
but that clears the market for assets.

974
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:47.870
But Fischer knew that was going to happen.
It always has to happen.

975
01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:49.010
That's the beauty of what he did.

976
01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:51.793
<v 1>Yes,</v>

977
01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:59.510
<v 2>yes.
So the point is so that you,
thank you.
I'm coming back to exactly that point.</v>

978
01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:03.470
So the point is,
when you look at the present value of land,

979
01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:07.250
it's going to be p plus p squared plus Pq plus p to the fourth.

980
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:11.690
The present value of land had better be finite.
Okay.
So in other words,

981
01:02:11.930 --> 01:02:13.580
p has to be less than one.

982
01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:17.390
Otherwise the value of land would be infinite and it wouldn't make any sense

983
01:02:17.391 --> 01:02:21.090
because in the very first old guy with an infinite amount of land,

984
01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:24.030
infinite value of land would buy more apples in there.
Possibly.

985
01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:27.840
We're in the world.
So you know that the interest rate,

986
01:02:27.841 --> 01:02:32.190
the real interest rate has to be positive.
If the real interest rate,
we're not,

987
01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:35.350
we're less than zero.
You would have to uh,

988
01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:39.390
Eh and s and you had some acid that paid a constant dividend forever.

989
01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:43.080
That acid would have an infinite value.
So the presence of land,

990
01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:45.450
which pays a constant,
uh,

991
01:02:45.451 --> 01:02:50.010
acid forever forces the rate of inch,
the real rate of interest to be positive.

992
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:54.660
So Samuelson and all this talk of negative real interest rates,

993
01:02:54.661 --> 01:02:57.180
it can't really happen if you think that land is going to lie,
you know,

994
01:02:57.181 --> 01:02:59.610
land is going to pay some dividend probably forever.

995
01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:02.340
So there's going to be a positive real rate of interest.
Yeah.

996
01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:07.940
Okay.
And so it means,
and social security,
if,

997
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:10.420
if like the young give up one and the uh,
the,

998
01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:12.800
the young give up one to get one back when they're old,

999
01:03:12.801 --> 01:03:15.740
they're always going to be losing because there's a positive real rate of

1000
01:03:15.741 --> 01:03:18.500
interest.
And so every generation has to lose.
Okay.

1001
01:03:18.501 --> 01:03:20.660
So were the exactly the point of all,
it's all,

1002
01:03:20.661 --> 01:03:24.620
it's precisely the point because of the presence of land,
you know,

1003
01:03:24.621 --> 01:03:27.380
that the real rate of interest is going to have to be positive.
You know,

1004
01:03:27.381 --> 01:03:30.620
Fisher never made this argument.
He said it's impatience and you know,

1005
01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:33.710
maybe if people are incredibly patient,
it could even turn out to be negative.

1006
01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:37.430
But a,
or if you know,
if output was bigger next period than it is this period,

1007
01:03:37.431 --> 01:03:41.030
you could even have a negative rate of interest but not so when you have land

1008
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:44.660
with a constant dividend forever,
then if the interest rate is constant,

1009
01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:48.320
it better be positive.
Otherwise the land would have infinite value.

1010
01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:52.310
Okay.
So it's a new argument for a positive rate of interest.

1011
01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:56.540
You have to have the,
the land has to have a finite value.

1012
01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:58.750
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1013
01:03:58.750 --> 01:04:00.370
<v 2>Okay.
Any other questions?</v>

1014
01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:08.730
So when you solve for a couple of EADS,
you're going to do it very easily.
Now,
uh,

1015
01:04:08.830 --> 01:04:12.070
I mean after we've done that a couple of times,
this will seem very easy for you.

1016
01:04:12.071 --> 01:04:13.750
I know it seems a little confusing now,

1017
01:04:13.751 --> 01:04:16.360
but let's just do a couple more thought experiment.

1018
01:04:16.361 --> 01:04:20.230
Suppose we do social security.
What will happen with social security?

1019
01:04:20.231 --> 01:04:24.310
How does that work?
What is social security mean?

1020
01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:28.300
Well,
social security means the young give the old something.

1021
01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:30.190
And until now,

1022
01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:34.810
we talked about it as if the young could give the old part of their endowment,

1023
01:04:34.811 --> 01:04:34.961
you know,

1024
01:04:34.961 --> 01:04:38.290
the young pay taxes and the taxes get handed over to the old guy that's pay as

1025
01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:41.650
you go.
And we talked as if it wouldn't change the equilibrium,

1026
01:04:41.890 --> 01:04:46.750
but we said at the same time that social security was the most gigantic program.

1027
01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:50.960
You know,
any government anywhere in the world has ever adopted.
So,

1028
01:04:50.961 --> 01:04:54.510
oh and it's on the size,
you know,
all the,
the,
the,

1029
01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:58.300
the giveaway was on the side was bigger than p for a year,
you know,

1030
01:04:58.301 --> 01:05:00.910
17 trillion compared to 12 14 trillion.

1031
01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:03.850
So clearly it's going to have an effect on the interest rate.

1032
01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:08.260
So we ought to take that into account if we're doing a more careful analysis of

1033
01:05:08.261 --> 01:05:11.470
social security.
So what would social security do?

1034
01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:13.630
How would I take into account social security?

1035
01:05:13.631 --> 01:05:18.010
Suppose every young person gave one unit,
you know,
one apple,
the old guy at

1036
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:21.670
<v 0>the same time.
How would I figure out what happened in the new equilibrium?</v>

1037
01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:25.320
How would the economy change?

1038
01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:35.210
What would I change and solve differently?

1039
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:58.160
Well it,
all I would do is I would change this to a,

1040
01:05:58.161 --> 01:06:01.940
to every young guy now only as to apples when he's young because he given one of

1041
01:06:01.941 --> 01:06:06.050
them to the old and the old would have to.
So all the way through here,

1042
01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:10.940
I would just change all this to a Tu Tu,

1043
01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:15.740
Tu,
Tu,
Tu,
Tu,
Tu.

1044
01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.800
Right?
And that's what I would do.
That's all I,

1045
01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:23.120
that's the change that I have to resolve the equilibrium.

1046
01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:27.230
So how would that change?
What would I change in my one equation?

1047
01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:34.740
Well,
the apples and the economy,
the young apples,

1048
01:06:34.741 --> 01:06:39.741
the guy's only got to what the old apples like olds got two and there's still

1049
01:06:40.411 --> 01:06:43.050
one apple coming from the land.
So that's still five.

1050
01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:46.050
But now every generation is going to be behaving a little bit differently.

1051
01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:50.420
They're going to have to,
when they're young and too,
when they're old,
this guy,

1052
01:06:50.421 --> 01:06:52.140
we have to,
when he's young and too,

1053
01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.450
and he's old and otherwise it's the same thing.

1054
01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:59.550
So I just resolve for the equilibrium.
Okay.

1055
01:06:59.551 --> 01:07:03.210
And so if I resolve for the equilibrium multiplying by two P,

1056
01:07:03.211 --> 01:07:08.211
I'll have two plus two p plus four p

1057
01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:14.790
multiplying by two p.

1058
01:07:18.290 --> 01:07:23.270
So no,
I might get for,
sorry,
I'm just confused myself.
I multiply by two P,

1059
01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:28.550
I've got a two plus two p multiplying by two P.

1060
01:07:28.551 --> 01:07:31.640
I have to pee here.
Okay.

1061
01:07:31.641 --> 01:07:36.200
Plause multiplying by two P.
I have two p squared here.

1062
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.950
I hope I'm doing this right.
Okay.

1063
01:07:39.951 --> 01:07:44.690
I've got 10 p on the right like I had before.
So now I've got two p squared

1064
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:50.970
minus 10 P and that's four pieces.

1065
01:07:50.971 --> 01:07:55.971
So it's still six Pete looks like plus two equals zero and so p equals six plus

1066
01:07:57.861 --> 01:08:01.580
or minus 36 minus eight

1067
01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:08.840
over four.
Okay.
And so that,

1068
01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.940
I hope I did that right.
Um,

1069
01:08:14.810 --> 01:08:18.680
I hope checking it.
Okay.
So that turns out to be,

1070
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:26.450
that turns out to be a p is 2.8 no,

1071
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:32.100
social security p is 0.38 now.
So this equals,

1072
01:08:32.101 --> 01:08:33.800
now that equals 0.38.

1073
01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:47.170
Okay,
so six minus square root of 28th.
Um,

1074
01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:53.030
okay.
So let's like,
so it's working out pretty much they'll s okay.

1075
01:08:53.031 --> 01:08:58.000
So,
um,
so 0.38 is the new price.
Okay.
So,

1076
01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:02.540
so therefore the interest rate one over one plus r equals 0.38.

1077
01:09:02.541 --> 01:09:06.620
So what do you think happens to the interest rate?
So our now equals,
okay,

1078
01:09:06.621 --> 01:09:09.140
before I write it,
you can figure out what it is yourself in a second.

1079
01:09:09.141 --> 01:09:12.170
Do you think the interest rate went up or down in the new economy?

1080
01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:17.810
What would Fisher have said?
Oh,
they went way up.

1081
01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:22.490
Okay.
And so it's actually 347%

1082
01:09:26.570 --> 01:09:31.040
okay.
So the interest rate went from 81% to um,
no,

1083
01:09:31.041 --> 01:09:35.340
that can't be right.
Went to a 161%.

1084
01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:41.190
Okay.
So the interest rate went up.
So the loss,

1085
01:09:41.250 --> 01:09:45.360
the loss is even worse than it seemed before.
Remember,
in present value terms,

1086
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:48.240
when you're young,
you give up one and when you're older you get one.

1087
01:09:48.241 --> 01:09:49.770
And so you lose the present value.

1088
01:09:49.771 --> 01:09:54.630
So the present value of that trade is this plus the hat over one plus R.

1089
01:09:54.631 --> 01:09:57.300
Well,
now that our has gone up,
you're leaving losing anymore.

1090
01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:01.680
So social security at the current interest rates looks bad for every generation.

1091
01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:05.070
After you do the social security and everybody understands it's happening,

1092
01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:08.550
it's going to be even worse in terms of present value.
Okay,

1093
01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:12.480
so social security hurts.
So social security,
again,

1094
01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:15.210
everybody is giving something when they're young to the old.

1095
01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:20.070
So the guy at the very beginning at the very top gains a lot.
Everybody else,

1096
01:10:20.071 --> 01:10:21.840
every other generation loses.

1097
01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:25.680
And you can compute the utility after social security compared to both for

1098
01:10:25.681 --> 01:10:26.700
social security.

1099
01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:31.970
And it goes from something like 2.7 to 2.3 so there's a substantial loss for

1100
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.210
everyone's utility except for the first generation.
On the other hand,

1101
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:40.560
we rescued the first generation.
Now there are two more experiments.

1102
01:10:40.650 --> 01:10:43.200
I'm not going to be able to finish today,
but I'm going to mention them.

1103
01:10:43.650 --> 01:10:48.450
Experiment.
One is,
suppose we had more and more children,
every generation.

1104
01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:53.190
How would we take that into account?
Well,

1105
01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:58.170
it's very simple to take into account.
The same thing with a trivial change.

1106
01:10:58.171 --> 01:11:02.040
You can figure out what happens with more and more generations with more and

1107
01:11:02.041 --> 01:11:04.810
more children.
Okay.
So I'm going to go back to three.
One,

1108
01:11:04.811 --> 01:11:07.800
this only takes me one minute.
Sorry about this.
I know time's running out,

1109
01:11:07.801 --> 01:11:09.570
but let me just finish this story.

1110
01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:17.400
<v 2>Okay.
So if we had more and more children in every generation,
so every 30 years,</v>

1111
01:11:17.401 --> 01:11:21.420
let's say the population doubled,
that's not such a high growth rate.
You know,

1112
01:11:21.490 --> 01:11:25.920
per year you'd have six and two here.
Okay.

1113
01:11:25.921 --> 01:11:30.500
And then he'd go up to 12 and four.
Okay.
And we'd have to,
but,
but again,
it's,

1114
01:11:30.501 --> 01:11:34.560
it's,
it's all exponentially growing.
And the dividends would also be growing.

1115
01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:39.450
So this would be two and four,
eight and 16,
et cetera.

1116
01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:43.140
Okay.
But as you'll see in a second,
the weight,
I won't do it this time.

1117
01:11:43.141 --> 01:11:46.590
Next time you'll see that it's very easy to solve for the new equilibrium.

1118
01:11:46.591 --> 01:11:49.680
We just put a,
you put a double here thing because the young,

1119
01:11:49.681 --> 01:11:53.070
they're twice as many young.
Okay.
You just solve it and you do the whole thing.

1120
01:11:53.071 --> 01:11:56.850
And what happens is social security isn't solved,

1121
01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:00.270
even though Sam Munson was in a way wrong again,

1122
01:12:00.271 --> 01:12:02.430
even though they're too okay,

1123
01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:05.430
even though they're two young people for every old person.

1124
01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:08.310
So every young person only has to give up half an apple.

1125
01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:12.680
You only have to give up half an apple when you're young.
Okay.

1126
01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:15.000
And when you're old,
you still get a whole apple back.

1127
01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:16.980
Sounds like now you surely should gain,

1128
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:19.860
but the point is you don't because the rate of interest gets higher.

1129
01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.070
And then we're going to have generations that alternate and size.

1130
01:12:23.071 --> 01:12:26.130
But all these are very easy to solve once you figure this out.

1131
01:12:26.131 --> 01:12:29.640
So today on Thursday,
you have to solve a problem just like that.

1132
01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:32.460
So you get the hang of it.
Just one problem to do for Thursday.
