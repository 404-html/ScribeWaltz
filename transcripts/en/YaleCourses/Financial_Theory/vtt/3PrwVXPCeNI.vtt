WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.050
Okay.
I think I should begin.

2
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.310
So we're,
uh,

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.780
at the point of the course now where we're talking about the capital asset

4
00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:14.810
pricing model and the economists

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.380
understanding of risk aversion and its consequence for the financial sector.

6
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.180
So much of what economists,
uh,
no,
it was already known,

7
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.110
you know,

8
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.110
two businessmen because it's common sense and even to literary writers like

9
00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:35.690
Shakespeare who was himself quite a successful businessman.

10
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.200
So you might remember that Shakespeare,
uh,

11
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.230
already had the idea of diversification.

12
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.640
<v 1>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.810
<v 0>In the merchant of Venice,
Antonio says,
uh,</v>

14
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.150
each boat on a different ocean,

15
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.050
you said it a bit more poetically than that,
but you know,

16
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.940
each sale on a different Argosy or something,
I forgot what it was,
but anyway,

17
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.320
each boat in a different ocean.

18
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.350
So it wasn't very worried because it was diversified and he also had the idea of

19
00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:10.490
a risk and return,

20
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.960
you know,
nothing ventured,
nothing gained,
nothing ventured.

21
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.440
So ventured means risk,
nothing gained.

22
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.830
So another way of saying this,
diversification is a,

23
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.870
don't put all your eggs in one basket.

24
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.753
<v 1>Okay.</v>

25
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.780
<v 0>Okay.
So how could a,</v>

26
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.610
so what of economists done that wasn't already known to every business person

27
00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:52.350
and every clever literary writer will economists have quantified this and turn

28
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:56.280
this into,
uh,
a usable practical piece of advice.

29
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.150
So the diversification CRM and cap m,

30
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:02.430
so I should have moved cap and I should have called this Shakespeare

31
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.730
and this cap him.

32
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.650
Cap m becomes the mutual fund theorem.

33
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.310
So the mutual fund ferrum has very practical advice.

34
00:02:18.311 --> 00:02:20.800
It says if you're investing in the stock market,

35
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.560
don't try to pick out individual stocks.

36
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.380
Hold every stock in proportion.

37
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.080
So its value in the whole economy.

38
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.210
If you want to be more venturesome,
don't pick riskier stocks.

39
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.030
Just simply leave less money in the bank.

40
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.240
So divide all your money between the index and the bank.

41
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.220
It says,
hold all your money in stocks in the same proportion,

42
00:02:48.221 --> 00:02:51.790
everyone else's holding them hold the market.
In other words,

43
00:02:51.791 --> 00:02:55.960
holding an index like the s and p 500 of all the stocks in proportion to how big

44
00:02:55.961 --> 00:02:59.920
they are.
And if you want to get more venturesome,
you know,
if you're,

45
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.200
if you're cautious,
put some of your money in the,

46
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.590
in the index and some of it in the bank.
If you want to be more venturesome,

47
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.040
take some money out of the bank and put it into the stocks.

48
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.730
But in the index,
if you want to be even more vendors than,
than that,

49
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.140
borrow the money to put the money into the stock market.
That's called leverage.

50
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.730
Okay?
But you should,
according to this theory,
not try to pick stocks.

51
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.850
So if you're interested in risk,

52
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.700
you shouldn't pick high technology startup companies.

53
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.420
You should pick the same mixture of,
uh,
you know,

54
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:35.110
blue chip companies like General Electric and these startup companies that

55
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:38.140
everybody else is choosing.
So that's what it means.
Diversify,

56
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:41.770
hold a little bit of everything in the same proportion as everyone else.

57
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:45.170
So it's much more precise,
much more surprising.
Uh,

58
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.170
then Shakespeare's advice.
Okay?
Then the,
then the,
uh,
then the,
you know,

59
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.540
then the second thing,
risk and reward,

60
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.580
it says that the price of a security,
so we'll call it a pie,

61
00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:02.470
Jay say,
which we used to think of as the expectation.

62
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:07.210
Of course you need the probabilities of the payoff of the security,
Jay.
Okay.

63
00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:10.180
Discounted.
That's what we would have thought the price was.

64
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.960
So this is called the covariance pricing theorem.

65
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.640
<v 1>Cool.</v>

66
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.440
<v 0>Okay.
The shocking thing is it's not the expectation discounted,</v>

67
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:26.230
which is what we thought it was before.
Okay.

68
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.570
We know that you have to adjust for risk somehow,

69
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:30.610
which we haven't taken into account before.

70
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.760
But what's so shocking is you might've thought you'd subtract maybe something

71
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.850
times the variance of the return of acid Jay,

72
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.710
but that's not going to be the case.

73
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.920
It's going to be surprisingly subtracting something times the covariance with

74
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:51.910
the market of acid Jay.
Okay.

75
00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:56.830
So you penalize the price of a stock should go lower if it gets riskier.

76
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.000
It's risk is not defined by what it's variances,
but,
but by what?

77
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:05.360
It's covariances with the market.
So I want to develop these two ideas,
uh,

78
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.580
in this lecture,
spend the whole lecture on just developing these two ideas,

79
00:05:09.581 --> 00:05:13.270
which was a mile for modern mathematical version of what Shakespeare already

80
00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:16.270
knew 400 years ago,
but made much more concrete,

81
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:19.480
much more precise with uh,
um,

82
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.260
the mathematics holy behind them.
So,

83
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.850
so what have we got here?
We imagine a world,
the situation,

84
00:05:27.851 --> 00:05:31.990
I'm going to describe as the one we had last time where we know that there are

85
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:33.730
different things that can happen.

86
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.880
These are the states with different probabilities.

87
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.280
So there's states,

88
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.673
<v 1>yeah,</v>

89
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.910
<v 0>s equals one to big s and each of them have probabilities with probabilities.</v>

90
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.510
<v 1>Yeah.
Mama s</v>

91
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.710
<v 0>of course,
the,
some of the gamma asked equals one.</v>

92
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.920
So everybody knows the probabilities of the states and then they know what the

93
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:05.590
payoff is and the different assets.
So here's a one,
here's a two,

94
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.560
here's a j say and they know what the payoffs are going to be.

95
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:14.561
A one in state won 81 in state to a one state s eight two and state one eight

96
00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:20.750
two.
I'm state S A J and state one ADJ in state s.

97
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.680
So given these probabilities and given the payoffs,

98
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.610
you can compute the expectation of each thing.

99
00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:32.240
You can compute the expectation of a j.

100
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.270
Say it's just the summation for mass equals one to s of gamma s a j s.

101
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.590
Okay.
You can also compute the variance.
So I'll,

102
00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:47.591
I'll write that sometimes is a bar j you can compute the variance of a j,

103
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.050
which is the summation s equals one to ask.

104
00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:59.051
Remember of gamma s a j s minus a bar and j squared.

105
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.671
Okay.

106
00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:06.671
And you could also compute the covariance of any to a j and a k

107
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.290
as summation,

108
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.320
gamma s a j s minus a Bar j times this is s equals one to s of a k s minus a

109
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:28.240
four k.
Okay,
so those three numbers,
the expectation,

110
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.660
the variance and the covariance between any pairs,

111
00:07:31.661 --> 00:07:33.940
those are numbers that anybody could compute.

112
00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.950
Knowing the payoffs are the assets and knowing the probabilities and what the

113
00:07:38.951 --> 00:07:42.460
theory is going to say.
The capital asset pricing model.

114
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:48.090
That model is going to explain how the prices of all the acids depend on their

115
00:07:48.281 --> 00:07:49.360
expectation,

116
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.410
their variances in their covariances under the assumption that people have

117
00:07:53.411 --> 00:07:57.270
quadratic utilities or more generally assume,

118
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.263
<v 2>uh,</v>

119
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.190
<v 0>okay.
Assume people</v>

120
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.720
only care about the mean.

121
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.870
That's the expectation and variance.

122
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:15.410
<v 2>Okay.</v>

123
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:16.760
<v 0>A final consumption.</v>

124
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:20.431
Okay,

125
00:08:20.431 --> 00:08:25.200
so we wrote that last time we said if you had quadratic utility for consumption

126
00:08:25.201 --> 00:08:28.500
in every state,
you could summarize these foul,
you know,

127
00:08:28.501 --> 00:08:31.260
there could be millions of states and thousands of securities.

128
00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:33.680
You add them all together and what you hold,
it depends.

129
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:37.620
It only depends on the end about what the expectation and the variance of your

130
00:08:37.621 --> 00:08:41.460
final portfolio is.
You like expectation and you hate variance.

131
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.080
So under that hypothesis,

132
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.800
we're going to have a very concrete interpretation of what Shakespeare was

133
00:08:46.801 --> 00:08:48.180
talking about from the beginning,

134
00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.020
which is gonna allow us to quantify what you should do,

135
00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:56.400
how people in the market are doing.
We'll be able to answer series of questions.

136
00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:01.830
Okay.
And then we'll be able to test the theory too.
So now the theory,
uh,

137
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:06.831
I'm about to explain was developed in 1950 began in 1950 when coupons,

138
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:11.970
who's a professor at the Coles Foundation,

139
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:14.190
the director of the Coles Foundation was in Chicago.

140
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:19.190
I told you the Coles Foundation was started by Alfred Cole's who'd been a Yale

141
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:23.220
undergraduate and his family owned the Chicago Tribune and a bunch of other

142
00:09:23.221 --> 00:09:28.221
newspapers and he ran a macro economic forecasting company in 1929 right after

143
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:33.090
the crash.
He was embarrassed to realize that,
uh,

144
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.500
he had predicted that everything was going to be fine and he sent around

145
00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:40.950
questionnaires and read everybody else's is competitors,
you know,

146
00:09:40.951 --> 00:09:44.940
newspapers and realize they've been predicting everything was going to be fine

147
00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:49.950
too,
except for one guy,
you know,
Jones,
Dow,
the Dow Jones Guy,

148
00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:54.150
except for that he,
everybody had been making the same,
you know,

149
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.590
rosy predictions.
And so he decided the whole subject of economic forecasting,

150
00:09:58.591 --> 00:10:01.920
in fact,
economics altogether was a fraud and he wanted to,

151
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:06.660
to put money in encouraging the use of mathematics and economics instead of the

152
00:10:06.661 --> 00:10:09.600
touchy feely.
Uh,
you know,

153
00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:14.190
more qualitative analysis that was the norm at the time.
So he took,

154
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:18.270
he went to see Irving Fisher,
who is the great Yale economist and said,

155
00:10:18.271 --> 00:10:19.410
what should I do with all the money?

156
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:23.220
Where should I put this institute and who should I invite to the institute?

157
00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:27.660
So Fisher and he set up the whole thing and it started in Colorado Springs

158
00:10:27.661 --> 00:10:31.440
because Fisher believed in fresh air and he wrote a lot of books about fresh air

159
00:10:31.441 --> 00:10:34.170
and how it staved off tuberculosis and things like that.

160
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:36.930
And no one wanted to go to Colorado Springs.

161
00:10:36.931 --> 00:10:40.770
So they moved it to Chicago where the family was originally from the cold's

162
00:10:40.771 --> 00:10:41.604
family.

163
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:47.030
And I'm the director then in the 50s was sown in coupons and coupons,

164
00:10:47.821 --> 00:10:52.821
had this idea of trying to examine risks by making people with quadratic

165
00:10:53.281 --> 00:10:57.240
utilities.
And he said,
okay,
student Markowitz,

166
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.300
why don't you try to develop a theory?
And Marco,
it's wrote,

167
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.620
began the theory of the capital asset pricing model.
Now the theory,

168
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.460
just to get a little ahead of the story,
Mark Woods went quite a ways,

169
00:11:08.461 --> 00:11:11.160
won a Nobel prize many years later for what he did,

170
00:11:11.161 --> 00:11:15.060
but didn't quite get to the end.
And while he was working on it,
uh,

171
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:19.020
coupons didn't want to be director anymore of coals.
And he invited Tobin,

172
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.820
the Great Yale economist to come and be a director of coals and Tova and got

173
00:11:23.821 --> 00:11:27.680
there.
And the coal,
the people at the University of Chicago said to Tobin,
what?

174
00:11:27.681 --> 00:11:29.940
We're glad you're coming,
you'll be right next to us.
But you know,

175
00:11:29.941 --> 00:11:33.960
don't try and get us mixed up with all those mathematical people at the Coles

176
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.350
Foundation.
They're all crazy.
We would like to keep the mathematics,

177
00:11:37.351 --> 00:11:40.850
you know that high tech mathematics out of our department.
That's just colds.

178
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:44.130
Crazy idea.
So Tobin refuse the job.

179
00:11:44.131 --> 00:11:48.810
Came back to Yale and Marco,
it's was so angry and not Mark Woods,
uh,

180
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.440
coupons.
His advisor was so angry that he went to Kohl's and said,

181
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:54.370
they're not treating right at the University of Chicago.

182
00:11:54.371 --> 00:11:59.200
Let's move the entire Coles foundation to Yale.
So in 1955,
they moved to,
to Yale.

183
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:04.000
But in these conversations,
Tobin had with coupons and the colts foundation,

184
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:08.650
he got to know what Markowitz was doing.
And so he added the final,

185
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:09.220
uh,

186
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:13.870
crowning achievement to the mutual fund theorem to the Markowitz,

187
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:18.820
uh,
uh,
set up.
And then he subsequently won the Nobel prize for that.

188
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:23.160
In fact,
the New York Times said in his,
uh,
right after and get in his,

189
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.530
it's description of what he won the Nobel Prize for the New York Times,

190
00:12:26.531 --> 00:12:30.100
said James Stone on the Nobel Prize for showing that you shouldn't put all your

191
00:12:30.101 --> 00:12:34.480
eggs in one basket.
So,
so anyway,
I will.

192
00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:38.020
So that's the theory that I have to explain now that it's a little bit less

193
00:12:38.021 --> 00:12:40.960
trivial than just saying don't put all your eggs in one basket.

194
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.460
So the idea is that you like expectation,
you hate variance.

195
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:50.050
So the first thing we're going to do is noticed that covariance,
I mean,
sorry,

196
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:54.850
standard deviation is defined as the square root of variance.

197
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.540
And so to say that you don't like variants means you don't like standard

198
00:12:58.541 --> 00:12:59.950
deviation or the same thing,

199
00:12:59.951 --> 00:13:02.500
but you're going to see it makes the diagrams much prettier.

200
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:07.830
So if we had a portfolio that you could choose among some combination of putting

201
00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:12.220
your money in the A's,
that's okay.
Putting your money in the A's,

202
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:17.230
you get some expectation and some standard deviation for your total portfolio

203
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.210
and people like more expectation and like less standard deviation.

204
00:13:22.211 --> 00:13:26.230
So the indifference curves are going in that direction,
unlike the usual picture.

205
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.710
That was the first step.
Now,

206
00:13:29.711 --> 00:13:33.770
the first thing we noticed last time we made a very,
and this was uh,

207
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:38.260
three weeks ago or so,
we made an extremely important observation.
We said,

208
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:43.350
what is the covariance of part of your money in x and the variance of part of

209
00:13:45.161 --> 00:13:49.150
your money in x and part and the rest of your money?

210
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.040
Let's say you have $1,

211
00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:55.540
so TNX and one minus t and y for example,

212
00:13:55.541 --> 00:13:58.270
half an ax and half.
And why?
Well,

213
00:13:58.271 --> 00:14:03.271
that is by definition the same as the covariance of this portfolio with itself.

214
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.670
And now we know this from this fear,
from,

215
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:14.900
from this definition of covariance that if you look at the covariance of Jay

216
00:14:14.901 --> 00:14:18.200
with Kay,
so fixing Kay,
this is just linear.

217
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.120
It's just the expected.

218
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:24.710
Did you know this is a constant multiplying the differences from Jay and it's

219
00:14:24.711 --> 00:14:28.550
expectation.
So,
so this is a linear in each variable.

220
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:33.820
So therefore this is going to equal the covariance of TX with TEACs plus twice

221
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:42.730
the covariance of t plus the covariance of TX and one minus t y a plus

222
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:54.140
the covariance of one minus t y and C X,

223
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:59.810
okay?
Plus one minus t squared.
So I'll put that one over here,

224
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:05.140
plus one minus t plus the covariance of one minus t y with itself.

225
00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.820
Okay?
So I've taken this with this,

226
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:14.620
then this with that than that with that and that with the thing on the end,
okay?

227
00:15:14.621 --> 00:15:19.330
But it's linear again,
so I can pull out all these things.
So okay,
so,

228
00:15:19.331 --> 00:15:20.380
so that's the formula.

229
00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:24.430
Now what we noticed is that if two stocks,

230
00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:29.110
x and y are independent,
they're covariances zero days.

231
00:15:29.111 --> 00:15:31.570
I'm assuming you remember that.
So those terms just go away.

232
00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:33.190
And then it's also linear.

233
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:38.220
So this is just going to equal t squared covariance of x with x,

234
00:15:38.351 --> 00:15:41.690
which is the variance of x.
Okay,

235
00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:45.530
so soon x,

236
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:47.810
y independent.

237
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:54.970
Then you can see then that is what allows me to cancel these two terms like

238
00:15:55.361 --> 00:15:56.194
that.

239
00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:00.420
So I get t squared times the covariance of x plus one,

240
00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:02.160
one minus t squared,

241
00:16:02.161 --> 00:16:05.520
times the variance variance and variance of y.

242
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:10.560
If I take t equals a half say,
so if I take two equals ha a half,

243
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:13.933
<v 1>okay,</v>

244
00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.710
<v 0>I know that the variance,</v>

245
00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:19.231
okay,

246
00:16:19.231 --> 00:16:24.231
the variance of a half x plus a half y equals a quarter times the variance of x

247
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:32.950
plus a quarter times the variance of y.
We derive this three weeks ago.

248
00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:33.790
I'm just repeating it.

249
00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.830
So the amazing thing is if x and y have the same expectation and the same

250
00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:40.870
variance,
but are independent of each other,

251
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:43.900
by splitting your money between two independent things,

252
00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:48.090
you're obviously going to have the same expectation,
but only,
uh,

253
00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:49.380
half the variance.

254
00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:55.580
And that last step is a variance of x equals variance of Y.

255
00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.220
Amazingly,
I mean,
it's not so amazing,
I guess if you thought about it,

256
00:16:58.221 --> 00:17:01.190
but if you haven't thought about it,
you've got to equal risks.

257
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:02.930
Neither one is better than the other.

258
00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.870
So why bother with one rather than the other?
They're both the same.

259
00:17:05.871 --> 00:17:09.140
But if they're independent,
you should put half your money in each of them.

260
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:13.790
You'll get the same expectation,
but you're going to get only half the variance.

261
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:16.690
So if you have to dice,
let's say,
uh,

262
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:21.500
the first die we'll give you,
you pay $100 for a dice.

263
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:25.940
You can get a hundred you can get a hundred plus the number of dots showing.

264
00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.930
So if it gets a one that's $101 and get a six,
it's $106.

265
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:32.600
So if you held one dice one day,

266
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:35.690
you'd get on average 103 and a half dollars.

267
00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:40.550
You could pay a hundred get a dye,
which on average pay 203 and a half.

268
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.690
Instead you could put $50 in the first die,

269
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:49.680
get half of that,
$50 in the second die,
get half of that.
So on average,

270
00:17:49.681 --> 00:17:51.540
you're still getting a hundred,
three and a half,

271
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:56.370
but the variance you get is going to be half of what it was before.
Okay?

272
00:17:56.371 --> 00:17:57.450
So in this picture,

273
00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:01.860
you start off with x and y with the same standard deviation and the same

274
00:18:01.861 --> 00:18:02.700
expectation,

275
00:18:02.701 --> 00:18:06.600
but they're independent and now you put half of your money in each and you all,

276
00:18:06.601 --> 00:18:09.120
you cut the variance in half,
which means you divide,

277
00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.330
you know the standard deviation is the square root.

278
00:18:11.331 --> 00:18:15.210
So you divided by the square root of two.
Okay?
So you've improved,

279
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:17.490
you've moved to the left,

280
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:22.380
you've gotten less standard deviation without constricting your expectation at

281
00:18:22.381 --> 00:18:26.430
all.
Okay?
So that's the most important thing to notice.

282
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:30.150
And I'm going to say it one more thing,
one more way.

283
00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:32.360
<v 2>Okay.</v>

284
00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:36.170
<v 0>I'm going to say,
I'm going to go back to this formula.
Okay.</v>

285
00:18:36.171 --> 00:18:38.600
Which is where the variance was here.

286
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.943
<v 2>Okay.</v>

287
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:45.090
<v 0>Okay.
Now suppose I,
um,</v>

288
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.400
okay,
so suppose what's,
look at that formula.

289
00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.760
Okay.
Suppose I take two stocks,
uh,

290
00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:00.850
which I'm going to switch now x and y.
That was most unfortunate.

291
00:19:00.851 --> 00:19:03.090
But suppose I take two stocks and I'm,

292
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.920
I'm at the point where all my money is and why.

293
00:19:05.921 --> 00:19:10.570
So I'm going to take the case t equals zero,
okay?
But before I take t,

294
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:15.040
so if I took t equals zero,
I would just have the variance of y.
Okay?

295
00:19:15.041 --> 00:19:19.300
So this would be,
oh,
that's actually quite good.
The variance of y.
Okay,

296
00:19:19.301 --> 00:19:22.540
so I have all my money and why I'd have this standard deviation and this

297
00:19:22.541 --> 00:19:23.440
expectation.

298
00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:28.530
Now what happens if the two have the same?
Uh,

299
00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:31.210
what if the two are independent x and y?

300
00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:34.720
Let's drop the fact that that they have the same variance.

301
00:19:34.721 --> 00:19:38.980
Now maybe x has way more variance than why does,
okay?

302
00:19:38.981 --> 00:19:41.590
So look at x is much riskier than y.

303
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.870
Maybe x has a higher variation,
that higher expectation than Y,

304
00:19:46.871 --> 00:19:48.220
but it's so risky.
You know,

305
00:19:48.221 --> 00:19:51.880
people who are risk averse wouldn't ever want to subject themselves to all this

306
00:19:51.881 --> 00:19:56.590
risk.
Say,
okay,
so maybe they should just stick with why you would think,
but no,

307
00:19:56.591 --> 00:19:57.790
the answer is you shouldn't.

308
00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:03.010
Because what happens if you start to mix some of your money in why?

309
00:20:03.011 --> 00:20:06.910
And put a little bit,
take it a little out of why and put a little bit into x.

310
00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.850
Well,
your cheat,
your expectation.

311
00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.910
If you take a little money out of why and put a little into x,

312
00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:16.390
your expectations is going to go up because it's going to be the average of x

313
00:20:16.391 --> 00:20:19.480
and y.
So the expectations going up,
but then you say,
oh,

314
00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.440
but my variance is going up so I wouldn't want to do it.
But no,
that's wrong.

315
00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.110
The variance is not going up because they're independent.

316
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:31.470
Even though x has a way higher variance than why mixing a little between the two

317
00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:36.460
lowers your variance.
So how could that be?
Seems quite shocking.

318
00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:37.810
Well,

319
00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:42.810
let's take the derivative of this with respect to having all your money

320
00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.640
originally and why.

321
00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:50.110
So this is the variance putting t dollars and acts and one minus t and y.

322
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.520
So we simply take the derivative of that with which I've done here.

323
00:20:54.521 --> 00:20:58.420
I suppose I could just,
Oh,
why don't I just write it out?
Take the dream of that

324
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.220
DDT of this.

325
00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:09.120
Okay equals two t times the variance of x plus two times one minus t times.

326
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.920
Okay?
But this is a minus.
I have to,
you know,
I take the driven,

327
00:21:17.921 --> 00:21:20.020
it's two times this times minus one.

328
00:21:20.021 --> 00:21:24.190
So minus two t two times one wine is teen variance of y.

329
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:32.190
So let's evaluate that at t equals zero.

330
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:36.650
The first term is zero.
The T is zero.

331
00:21:36.651 --> 00:21:38.880
So this doesn't matter the second term to you,
zero.

332
00:21:38.881 --> 00:21:43.280
So this is minus two times the variance of y.
It's going down,

333
00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:48.170
okay?
The variance is actually going down here,
okay?

334
00:21:48.171 --> 00:21:51.860
So just as the says,
the Varian starts down,
eventually it has to end up here.

335
00:21:51.861 --> 00:21:53.060
So as you move your money,

336
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:56.750
all of it originally and why and start moving some of it into x,

337
00:21:56.751 --> 00:22:01.540
your variance is going to go down.
Okay?

338
00:22:01.541 --> 00:22:06.541
So that those two things put together are the argument for diversification.

339
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.080
If they're independent and they're,
they're identical,

340
00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:13.960
venue should would half of your money in each.
But even if they're not identical,

341
00:22:13.961 --> 00:22:18.100
you shouldn't stick to why you should mix why with some acts.
Okay?

342
00:22:18.101 --> 00:22:21.370
So there is why diversification is such a good idea.

343
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:25.930
So it's not all diversification.
It's diversification of independent risks.

344
00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:30.220
So there's a little bit of a mathematical nuance.

345
00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.730
Diversification of independent risks is bound to help you.

346
00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:38.710
Everybody should diversify a little bit cause you can reduce your risk.

347
00:22:38.711 --> 00:22:41.170
Okay,
so that's the first important fought.

348
00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:44.610
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

349
00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:47.240
<v 0>no I don't want to um,</v>

350
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:51.300
do too much in the mathematics.
But uh,

351
00:22:51.301 --> 00:22:54.510
so I prove in the t in the notes,
but I won't do it here.

352
00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:58.170
Suppose we didn't assume x and Y we're independent.

353
00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.580
Suppose x and y were arbitrarily chosen.
You know,

354
00:23:02.581 --> 00:23:06.210
they have big covariance,
whatever you want.
Okay.

355
00:23:06.211 --> 00:23:11.100
Then what is going to happen when you combine your money between x and y?

356
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.780
So there's a proof,
which I'm not going to give because I'm a little bit behind.

357
00:23:15.781 --> 00:23:16.920
So the proof is this.

358
00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:20.700
Suppose we have exactly the same situation where you started with why and you've

359
00:23:20.701 --> 00:23:25.680
got x and you could think of moving your money in between x and y.

360
00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:31.440
Okay,
well if it turns out,
if they're perfectly correlated,

361
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:35.270
so really they're the same thing.
Why is just,
you know,
80% of acts,

362
00:23:35.271 --> 00:23:39.810
it's the same stock.
So moving back between them,
it's not really changing your,

363
00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:43.330
your,
you know,
w x is just a bag,
you know,
uh,
uh,
uh,

364
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:48.320
a scalar improvement on why so it has more expectation and more standard

365
00:23:48.321 --> 00:23:50.060
deviation.
If that were the case,

366
00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:54.350
you just move on that straight line that connects the two points.

367
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:57.710
I must have a way of doing this.
Yes.

368
00:23:57.711 --> 00:24:00.440
So just if they were perfectly correlated,

369
00:24:00.441 --> 00:24:04.460
you would just be moving along this line by putting your money in between.

370
00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.630
If they're independent that you're going to move along that line.
Okay.

371
00:24:08.631 --> 00:24:10.670
But no matter how correlated they are,

372
00:24:10.671 --> 00:24:12.470
as long as they're not perfectly correlated,

373
00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.290
it's going to turn out the curve you get by moving between them,

374
00:24:15.291 --> 00:24:18.290
it's going to look like that.
If there are negatively correlated,

375
00:24:18.291 --> 00:24:21.530
then you can really improve yourself and you'll get a curve that looks like that

376
00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.750
independent will be like this,
uh,
positive correlated but not perfectly.

377
00:24:25.751 --> 00:24:28.970
It will be like that and a perfectly positively correlated,

378
00:24:28.971 --> 00:24:31.460
no diversification gains.
You get the straight line,

379
00:24:31.461 --> 00:24:36.020
but you're always above the straight line.
Okay.
So that's a kind of,
anyway,

380
00:24:36.021 --> 00:24:38.240
that's a,
okay,

381
00:24:38.241 --> 00:24:41.840
it takes a little bit of a Algebra a to prove that,
you know,

382
00:24:41.841 --> 00:24:45.140
the Koshi Schwartz and equality,
but we're not,
so we skipped that.
But anyway,

383
00:24:45.141 --> 00:24:50.000
that's a mathematical fact.
Okay.
And you see an independent case.
We basically,
uh,

384
00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.470
you know,
we proved,

385
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:55.460
we proved that the line has to start going that way and eventually it has to end

386
00:24:55.461 --> 00:24:55.941
up here.

387
00:24:55.941 --> 00:24:59.270
So it shouldn't be no surprise that it looks like that and the independent case.

388
00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.660
And then it turns out that every other cases sort of in between that are at the

389
00:25:02.661 --> 00:25:05.600
other extreme.
And it always has this bowed out shape.

390
00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:11.960
Okay?
So there's always gains to diversification.
Um,

391
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.990
something you're getting out of diversification,

392
00:25:14.991 --> 00:25:19.430
the risk is somehow going down by mixing things up.
All right?

393
00:25:19.431 --> 00:25:23.360
So that's it.
That's the,
that's the mathematics.
And that's the general principle.

394
00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:26.390
Now,
what can you get out of this?

395
00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.630
I want to derive these two famous theorems,

396
00:25:29.631 --> 00:25:32.810
which we already saw in action and the example that we calculated,

397
00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:34.550
but it seemed like a miracle.

398
00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.300
So what did we find in the example we calculated last time in class,

399
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.630
we found that there we only had two stocks,

400
00:25:41.631 --> 00:25:46.220
but if there had been hundreds of stocks and millions of states of nature and

401
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:50.300
each person had a different utility,
different risk aversion,
but all quadratic,

402
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:53.810
and you calculated the competitive equilibrium,

403
00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:55.940
assuming there are arrows securities,

404
00:25:56.090 --> 00:26:01.090
it would end up that every consumer held the same mix of all these stocks plus

405
00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.720
positive or negative amounts of a bond.

406
00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:09.920
So the mutual fund theorem turned out to be true that the best thing everybody

407
00:26:09.921 --> 00:26:14.360
could do was hold the same amount,
the same proportion of stocks and bonds,

408
00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.010
and maybe more or less of the riskless asset,

409
00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.740
maybe even negative of the riskless acid.

410
00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:23.120
So I want to show you why that's true now it seems like,

411
00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:25.850
and then we're going to have to talk about whether they really believe it or
not.

412
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:30.260
So let's see what an implication is.
Well,

413
00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:34.250
suppose now what I do is I write down,

414
00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.600
I have all these stocks,
x,
Y,
and z.

415
00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.900
So you could imagine you have a certain amount of money.
Okay.

416
00:26:41.901 --> 00:26:45.780
So you could imagine putting money,
putting your money.

417
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:50.580
So let's suppose that I've written down all the stocks.
The prices are given,

418
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:55.530
let's say prices
of stocks or enact Librium.

419
00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:04.810
Okay,
so I saw for the equilibrium like we did last time,
and I write down x,

420
00:27:04.811 --> 00:27:06.070
Q,
y,
and z.

421
00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:10.810
These are the expectation and standard deviation per dollar of uh,

422
00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:14.020
the stocks or per I dollars on the stock.

423
00:27:14.021 --> 00:27:16.360
Maybe the person has exactly I dollars.

424
00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:19.450
So let's say it's I dollars of each stock,

425
00:27:19.451 --> 00:27:24.390
what their expectation in return and standard deviation would be.
If,
if a $1,

426
00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:28.300
you get some expectation,
standard deviation,
$10 for the same stock,

427
00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:33.400
you'd be able to buy 10 shares,
which means you would a 10 times as many shares,

428
00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:36.640
which means you'd have 10 times the expectation and 10 times the standard

429
00:27:36.641 --> 00:27:41.620
deviation.
Okay?
So I can,
you know,
I,
whenever the guy's income is,

430
00:27:41.621 --> 00:27:44.560
I'll fix the dollars any,

431
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:49.060
they'll fix these returns as per his income because he's going to spend all his

432
00:27:49.061 --> 00:27:51.910
income on these stocks.
Okay?
So what could he do?

433
00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:55.000
He could put all his money into X.

434
00:27:55.001 --> 00:27:59.440
He'd end up here or all his money into why he ended up here are all his money

435
00:27:59.441 --> 00:28:00.940
into z and he's ended up here,

436
00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:04.600
but maybe wants to divide part of his money and why and part of it,

437
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:09.870
pardon Z and part and why he'll be somewhere like here or maybe wants to instead

438
00:28:09.941 --> 00:28:13.840
put part of his money inZ and part of it in acts while he could,

439
00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.630
he could end up here,
but why should he stop there?

440
00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:20.990
Maybe he wants to take some combination of the money that was in z and x,

441
00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:24.790
you know,
and combine it with some combination of things that was in z and lie,

442
00:28:24.791 --> 00:28:27.880
combine this and this,
that will get them out to here.
Okay.

443
00:28:27.881 --> 00:28:30.820
So there are lots of different combinations a he could hold.

444
00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:34.660
So graphically it looks like that mathematically.

445
00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:37.883
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

446
00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.860
<v 0>Mathematically.
What's he trying to do?
He's trying to,</v>

447
00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:45.490
so are now I've replaced a with our,

448
00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:51.270
so RJ is just going to equal a j um,

449
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:57.760
divided by the price of Jay.
Maybe Times I,

450
00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:03.280
okay.
So Rj will be the
fact,

451
00:29:03.281 --> 00:29:06.160
let's just say it's pie.
It's a age,
a divided by Pi j.

452
00:29:06.161 --> 00:29:09.190
So Rj is the return per dollar.
You putting the acid,

453
00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:13.510
RJ is the payoff of the acid per dollar.
Let's stick with that.

454
00:29:13.511 --> 00:29:17.290
Let's say the guy's a dollar to spend.
So it's the return per dollar.
Okay?

455
00:29:17.291 --> 00:29:20.950
And so and so those are all as possibilities.
Now what does he want to do?

456
00:29:20.951 --> 00:29:23.440
He wants to choose his money.

457
00:29:23.441 --> 00:29:26.740
How much money he's going to put in each acid.
Okay?

458
00:29:26.741 --> 00:29:29.860
Which is only go one through Omega j.

459
00:29:29.861 --> 00:29:33.640
That's the money he's going to put in each acid.
And if he does that,

460
00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:38.650
he's going to have a portfolio,
which is,
you know,
I'll write as our omega.

461
00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.930
So it's going to have a certain expectation,
a certain,

462
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:46.540
so the question is how should he divide his money between the assets?
Okay?

463
00:29:46.541 --> 00:29:50.110
And here's the kind of stuff he could imagine doing was very complicated,

464
00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:52.690
but it's going to turn out to be very simple.

465
00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.060
So there are any questions about what we're doing so far.

466
00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.420
So I want to get a simple rule to tell you what the practical advice about what

467
00:30:04.421 --> 00:30:08.870
to do.
So Marco,
it's posed this problem.
This is the mark,

468
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:12.783
<v 2>okay?</v>

469
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:18.010
<v 0>Now it turns out by this argument,
you see that I,</v>

470
00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:22.080
if I keep combining things over and over again,
I'm getting this sort of blob.

471
00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.290
But the blog is always pushing itself further and further out.

472
00:30:25.291 --> 00:30:27.750
It's always convex cause given any two points,

473
00:30:27.751 --> 00:30:30.140
I can always do the thing to the left of it.
So,

474
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:34.110
so if I could do this and I could do this and I look at the line connecting
them,

475
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:37.260
I can always be above that line by spreading my money.

476
00:30:37.261 --> 00:30:41.220
Between those two acids are given this combination of acids that produce this

477
00:30:41.221 --> 00:30:44.040
expectation and standard deviation and given that one up there,

478
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:47.730
I can combine the two and do better than the straight line connecting them due

479
00:30:47.731 --> 00:30:48.391
to the left of it.

480
00:30:48.391 --> 00:30:53.391
So therefore all the combinations put together have to geometrically look like

481
00:30:53.491 --> 00:30:56.100
this in the end.
Okay?

482
00:30:56.101 --> 00:30:58.500
So I'm going to do this algebraically in a second.

483
00:30:58.501 --> 00:31:02.730
They have to look like that if I did every possible variation,
okay?

484
00:31:02.731 --> 00:31:03.870
It couldn't have,

485
00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:09.030
it couldn't end up with a picture where after I do every possible variation.

486
00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:13.860
If this is the expectation,
this is the standard deviation.

487
00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:18.000
I couldn't get something that looked like that because I would just combine this

488
00:31:18.001 --> 00:31:20.940
thing with this thing,
whatever portfolio produced this,

489
00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:25.700
whatever portfolio produced that I put half my money into each of the stocks at.

490
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:29.280
This told me to do half the money in each of the stocks this told me to do.

491
00:31:29.281 --> 00:31:32.520
I'd still end up investing $1 and instead of getting the line,

492
00:31:32.521 --> 00:31:34.560
I get something that looked like that.
Okay,

493
00:31:34.561 --> 00:31:37.200
so I couldn't have the thing going in like that.
It has to go out,

494
00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:40.890
but then of course I can combine this and this and get that and so I'm going to

495
00:31:40.891 --> 00:31:42.930
end up with this kind of shape.

496
00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:48.240
Now I'm going to prove that algebraically,
but if I had that kind of shape,

497
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:51.840
then what would the guy do?
He'd choose something like that where he's tangent.

498
00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:57.170
Okay.
That's what Mark Woods basically did,
except he did it algebraically.

499
00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:58.610
So let's,

500
00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:00.010
<v 2>okay.</v>

501
00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:01.700
<v 0>All right,
so that's what Mark Woods did.</v>

502
00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:03.580
<v 2>Okay.</v>

503
00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.560
<v 0>All right,
so that doesn't seem to have gotten us very far.</v>

504
00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.770
So you notice that different people are going to make different choices.

505
00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:13.000
If somebody care is incredibly worried about,
um,

506
00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:17.080
someone's not very worried about the standard deviation and cares a lot about

507
00:32:17.081 --> 00:32:21.310
expectation,
they're going to have a flatter indifference curve.

508
00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:25.500
So instead of looking like that,
it'll be a flatter thing.
And so if it's flatter,

509
00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.850
the guy who cares,
this is the guy,

510
00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:30.850
sorry if it's flat or it means he cares about expectation and not standard

511
00:32:30.851 --> 00:32:35.851
deviation because you know a little bit of expectation can compensate him for a

512
00:32:36.251 --> 00:32:39.680
lot more standard deviation.
So it was indifference curve flatter.

513
00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:43.820
He's going to choose further up and so he's going to choose a point like way up

514
00:32:43.821 --> 00:32:47.270
there and so he's going to get a higher expectation and higher standard

515
00:32:47.271 --> 00:32:51.110
deviation and someone who's more risk averse is going to choose like where that

516
00:32:51.111 --> 00:32:55.370
point is.
So that's qualitative.
We what's going on?
All right,

517
00:32:55.371 --> 00:32:57.830
so Mark Woods played around with his,
played around with this,

518
00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:02.980
then Tobin appears on the scene and Tobin says all this gets so much easier if

519
00:33:03.891 --> 00:33:05.690
you have a riskless acid.

520
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:10.640
Let's suppose that there's a bond.
You haven't mentioned the bond yet.

521
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:15.800
Let's suppose we have a bond.
Okay,
that pay something for sure.

522
00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.530
And we're going to ignore inflation.
Tobin said,

523
00:33:18.531 --> 00:33:19.970
which is a big problem because we have,

524
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.450
we should come back to that if we have time.
We're going to ignore inflation.

525
00:33:23.451 --> 00:33:27.590
So us treasuries going to pay a certain amount of money for sure.

526
00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:32.720
So it has an expectation like this,
but no standard deviation is zero.

527
00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:37.070
Now,
why is this so important?
Well,

528
00:33:37.071 --> 00:33:42.071
let's imagine combining this riskless bond with some other stock x,

529
00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:48.940
a dollar's worth of x dollars worth of the riskless bond gets you 1.06 say a

530
00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.200
dollar's worth of x gets you much.
You know,

531
00:33:51.201 --> 00:33:56.030
maybe your average is one point 12 but your,
you're also running a big risk.

532
00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.930
What happens if you put your money part way in between them?

533
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.600
<v 2>Okay?</v>

534
00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.110
<v 0>Okay.</v>

535
00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:07.110
So suppose you put part of your money in acts and the rest of your money in the

536
00:34:07.991 --> 00:34:08.920
riskless bond.

537
00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:13.090
What's your expectation going to be where your expectation,

538
00:34:13.091 --> 00:34:18.091
let's say you know axes 12% and why is 6% 1.06 and 1.12 okay,

539
00:34:20.321 --> 00:34:23.560
the average is going to be 1.09 if you put half your money in both,

540
00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:26.770
but what is the standard deviation going to be?

541
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:28.300
<v 2>Okay,</v>

542
00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.870
<v 0>well I claim it's just going to be on that straight line.
Why is that?</v>

543
00:34:31.871 --> 00:34:36.550
Because the risk list thing has covariate zero if x is riskless,

544
00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.090
it's covariants is going to be zero with why.

545
00:34:40.091 --> 00:34:44.580
So these terms are going to disappear.
Okay,
look at the covariants.

546
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:48.190
If,
if x,
if Jay is the riskless bond,

547
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:52.060
it pays always its expectations.
So these numbers are always zero.

548
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:56.440
So therefore the covariance of that thing with anything go variance of y with

549
00:34:56.441 --> 00:35:00.640
any ax is going to be zero.
So therefore,

550
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.320
and not only that,
but the variance of y itself is also zero.

551
00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.350
So all you get is for the,

552
00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:12.760
for the variance of a t dollars and acts and one minus t dollars.

553
00:35:12.761 --> 00:35:16.750
And why you just get t squared times the variance of x.

554
00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.550
But then when you take the standard deviation,

555
00:35:18.551 --> 00:35:23.260
it's just t times the standard deviation of y,
of x.
So in other words,

556
00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:24.580
the variant,

557
00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:28.810
the standard deviation of the mixture of why annex lives right on the line.

558
00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:30.640
So unlike to put another way,

559
00:35:30.641 --> 00:35:35.620
something that has no variances perfectly correlated with everything else,

560
00:35:35.621 --> 00:35:39.270
it makes no difference whether other thing goes up or down.
It doesn't tell you,

561
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:43.110
you still know it,
why he's going to be so,
okay.

562
00:35:43.111 --> 00:35:45.900
So unlike everything else where you have this bowl shape thing,

563
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:49.560
the riskless asset just connects everything to a straight line.

564
00:35:49.561 --> 00:35:54.120
So if there were a riskless acid and you can do this with some x and here was

565
00:35:54.121 --> 00:35:56.850
the z,
you could also do that.
Or You could do that.

566
00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:02.320
Is this clear?
Okay.
So the punchline,

567
00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:06.400
which we're now gonna see Algebraic Lee,
the punch line is,
and by the way,

568
00:36:06.401 --> 00:36:10.030
if I combine,
what does it mean to extend that wine?

569
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:14.260
I should have extended that line.
That was a huge mistake.
Suppose instead of,

570
00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:18.190
so here I put half,
here's all the money in the riskless acid,

571
00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:21.130
here's half the wanting the risk of this asset and half an x.

572
00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:25.120
Here's all my money in x.
What would happen if I extended the line here?

573
00:36:25.121 --> 00:36:29.620
What would that correspond to?
I'm now at a point on the extension of the wine.

574
00:36:29.621 --> 00:36:31.270
What does that,
how do I get that?

575
00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:34.510
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

576
00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:39.100
<v 0>right.
That's negative y and and bigger than one in x.</v>

577
00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:43.720
So negative a half of x plus one and a half of why that's still a dollar.

578
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:48.370
I sold x short and so I'm just going to continue the line that way.
Okay,

579
00:36:48.371 --> 00:36:52.240
so I shouldn't have stopped here.
I could've kept going.
Okay,
so it's,

580
00:36:52.241 --> 00:36:56.110
it's putting money in the bank and sharing it between a single stock puts me on

581
00:36:56.111 --> 00:36:59.590
this line,
borrowing money from the bank to put in the stock.

582
00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:02.980
It's called leveraging my return puts me on the extension of the line.

583
00:37:02.981 --> 00:37:07.390
We're going to come back to that in a second.
Okay,
so knowing that now,

584
00:37:07.391 --> 00:37:10.870
what should I do?
Is there something really simple?

585
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:13.723
<v 2>Well,</v>

586
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:17.830
<v 0>what would you do here faced with this choice?</v>

587
00:37:17.831 --> 00:37:20.980
I mean which combination of stocks and bonds would you hold?

588
00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.800
I say it's really simple.

589
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:33.190
You just look for a line through the risk list point that's tangent to this

590
00:37:34.101 --> 00:37:36.860
blurb,
chaplains to be here

591
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:41.900
and now you should choose your point anywhere along this line.

592
00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:47.490
Independent of what your utilities,
your mean variance,
utilities are,

593
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.340
no matter how risk averse you are or how risk loving you are,

594
00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:52.560
you should choose somewhere along this line.

595
00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:01.460
Hey,
why?
Why is that?
Well,

596
00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:05.360
I've drawn with this Blob,

597
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:10.010
I've drawn all the possible combinations I could get by mixing different risky

598
00:38:10.011 --> 00:38:13.880
assets when I left out of the picture is all the combinations I could get by

599
00:38:13.881 --> 00:38:17.820
adding the,
the riskless asset.
I've got all the risky acid combination.

600
00:38:17.821 --> 00:38:19.670
So that's the blob.
Okay.

601
00:38:19.671 --> 00:38:24.020
And now I want to do the adding the riskless acid means I can take,
you know,

602
00:38:24.021 --> 00:38:25.850
part of my money in here,
in part in there.

603
00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:30.320
So in particular I can put part of my money here and part of my money there or I

604
00:38:30.321 --> 00:38:34.430
can go short.
So whatever this combination was,
that's the best thing I should,

605
00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:37.570
I can do now I can get everything along this line.

606
00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:41.710
Nothing else can do better because let's,
what other combination could there be?

607
00:38:41.711 --> 00:38:45.640
It has to be the risk,
less acid plus a bunch of risky assets,

608
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:49.150
but combining the risky assets just puts me in the blob.
Okay.

609
00:38:49.151 --> 00:38:50.490
And then combining whatever.
So it,

610
00:38:50.491 --> 00:38:54.370
Mike put me here in the blob and the ones I combine that with the riskless acid,

611
00:38:54.371 --> 00:38:57.820
I'll be on that line.
This line is always below that line.

612
00:38:57.821 --> 00:38:59.980
So this is the best possible thing I can do.

613
00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:05.010
No combination of the restless acid and any other combination of risky acids

614
00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.090
that always put me on some line from here through some point in the blog,

615
00:39:10.091 --> 00:39:12.460
which is going to belong be below this tangent point.

616
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:17.470
So this is the best thing I can do and it's independent of whether I was risk

617
00:39:17.471 --> 00:39:21.130
averse or risk lover.
If I'm risk averse and want to play it safe,

618
00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:24.430
you know my utility function,
I forgot what those looked like.

619
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:29.680
My indifference curves,
you know,
I'll,

620
00:39:29.681 --> 00:39:31.360
I'll do,
I'll be here.

621
00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:35.410
I'll put most of my money in the bank and not very many and the risky stock.

622
00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:37.590
If I'm more of a risk lover,
I'll be me,

623
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:41.770
be here and I'll choose to put a good fraction of my money in the stock and only

624
00:39:41.771 --> 00:39:44.410
a little in the bank.
If I'm really reckless,

625
00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:48.970
I'll borrow money and putting the stock market and be way up there.
Okay.
So,

626
00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:53.470
but everybody will do the same thing no matter what their preferences are.

627
00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.650
They'll all be along the same line.
Okay,

628
00:39:56.651 --> 00:40:01.600
so that's the mutual fund theorem.
Why is that?
The Mutual Fund Theorem?

629
00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:06.840
Because it says everybody shouldn't invest in the same index of stocks and put

630
00:40:07.361 --> 00:40:08.770
more or less money in the bank.

631
00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:11.740
So every single person ought to be doing the same thing.

632
00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:14.890
This is the mutual fund that everybody should hold.

633
00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:20.230
Whatever combination of stocks that got me to this point is the,

634
00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:24.160
is the mutual fund that everybody should hold and combine that with putting

635
00:40:24.161 --> 00:40:25.630
money in the bank.
Okay.

636
00:40:25.631 --> 00:40:29.290
So let's just prove that algebraically in a special case,

637
00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.950
which is going to illustrate the point,
the idea of it anyway.

638
00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.153
<v 1>Okay.</v>

639
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:40.820
<v 0>Okay.
So I'm doing a very special case here,</v>

640
00:40:40.821 --> 00:40:42.650
but just to illustrate it algebraically.

641
00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:47.480
So suppose that the rs are,

642
00:40:47.481 --> 00:40:51.650
as we said,
the returns up here per dollar of stock,

643
00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:56.240
the okay,
the the R Zero I've now added,

644
00:40:56.690 --> 00:41:00.890
and that's going to be the riskless asset that pays like a dollar six all the

645
00:41:00.891 --> 00:41:05.370
time.
If the interest rate is 6% so now you have your money.
Oh my God,

646
00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.180
I dollars.
You're the investor with I dollars.

647
00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:13.550
You can divide that money into the riskless acid or any one of the J uh,

648
00:41:13.551 --> 00:41:14.270
assets.

649
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:19.270
So here you've got r zero you can get that return our won up to Rj and you can

650
00:41:20.091 --> 00:41:23.660
put money,
Omega Zero Omega One Omega j.

651
00:41:23.661 --> 00:41:26.390
But of course this all has to add up to I.

652
00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.600
So how should you do it?
Well,

653
00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:35.750
you care about your expectation and you hate variance.

654
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:40.040
So I'm doing just a special case to make it a illustrate the idea.

655
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:45.310
Suppose I write down your utility as if it were the expectation minus Alpha

656
00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.460
Times the variance.
It could be a more complicated function.
You know,

657
00:41:49.461 --> 00:41:54.461
we said already that the quadratic utility is giving you expectation minus some

658
00:41:55.160 --> 00:42:00.160
Alpha expectation squared minus some other Alpha Times.

659
00:42:00.501 --> 00:42:04.280
The variance,
right?
That's the utility we derived from quadratic.

660
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:07.430
When people have quadratic utility is over consumption,

661
00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:11.810
they're induced utility of our portfolios.
Is this thing.
Okay,

662
00:42:11.811 --> 00:42:13.760
so it's not exactly the one I've written down,

663
00:42:13.761 --> 00:42:17.360
but the argument would be just the same.
And this is shorter and simpler.

664
00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.880
So just to illustrate the flavor of it,

665
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.930
let's say all you care about is your expectation minus some constant,

666
00:42:23.931 --> 00:42:25.820
how risk averse you are at times the variance.

667
00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:30.170
And now let's suppose to keep it even simpler that the assets are all

668
00:42:30.171 --> 00:42:34.280
independent.
Okay.
None of the theory doesn't rely on that.

669
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:37.670
I'm just saying suppose it worse so he can algebraically get it without having

670
00:42:37.671 --> 00:42:41.220
to work very hard.
So you're maximizing your expectation.

671
00:42:41.221 --> 00:42:43.670
So the bar above means the expectation.

672
00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:46.310
So what's your expectation of Omega dollars in here?

673
00:42:46.311 --> 00:42:48.230
Omega one in here and Omega Jay in here.

674
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:50.960
Just Omega zero times the expectation of this.

675
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:56.500
So your expectation then it's going to be only cause zero times are zero bar.

676
00:42:57.081 --> 00:43:00.260
That's the expectation of that.
Plus Omegle on our bar,

677
00:43:00.261 --> 00:43:03.950
one plus Omega j r Bar j,

678
00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:09.230
that's your,
these are at the top for some reason.

679
00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.640
That's your expectation.
Now what's your variance?
The thing that you don't like,

680
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:15.500
your variance is going to be,

681
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:19.003
<v 2>well,</v>

682
00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:23.440
<v 0>the variance is just going to be the variance of these,
their independence.</v>

683
00:43:23.441 --> 00:43:27.000
So the variance is just going to be,
um,
what I've written.

684
00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:28.700
<v 2>Okay.</v>

685
00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:33.390
<v 0>Omega,
whatever the V.
So I'll call the variance of RJ sigma.</v>

686
00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.650
So it's going to be single is zero squared.

687
00:43:35.651 --> 00:43:40.440
That's the variance of Sigma Cro Times Omega Zero squared.
Remember,

688
00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:44.190
because for varying,
you have to square feet,
multiply by something,
okay?

689
00:43:44.191 --> 00:43:48.390
Plus only go one squared sigma,
one squared,

690
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:53.340
plus all my good j squared,
Sigma j squared.
Now of course,

691
00:43:53.341 --> 00:43:57.540
remember that the variance,
the riskless thing is zero.

692
00:43:57.541 --> 00:44:01.740
So that's actually zero.
Okay?
So this is the variance you have to watch out for.

693
00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:06.810
This is the expectation you want.
How should you pick Omega Zero Omega,
Omega,
Che,

694
00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:11.520
um,
when your penalty for,
for having too much variances.
Alpha.

695
00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.540
Okay.
So different investors have different risk aversion.

696
00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:15.810
So they have different Alphas.

697
00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:20.070
Should they be led as Mark Woods thought without the riskless asset.

698
00:44:20.071 --> 00:44:22.980
Remember with the Blob,
like this one guy who's going to pick here,

699
00:44:22.981 --> 00:44:26.310
another guy was going to pick there,
they'd all do very different things.

700
00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:29.970
Tobin added this riskless acid and low and behold,

701
00:44:29.971 --> 00:44:33.000
now everyone should do the same.
So why is that?

702
00:44:33.001 --> 00:44:36.390
We just produced this algebraically.
Okay,
solve it algebraically.

703
00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:40.350
So the constraint is a nuisance to maximize something with the constraints.

704
00:44:40.351 --> 00:44:43.680
A nuisance.
So you just noticed that if you satisfy the constraint,

705
00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:48.030
Omega zero has to equal I minus the sum of the Omega Jays.

706
00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:51.390
So if I substitute for Omega Zero Right up there,

707
00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:56.310
I substitute I minus the sum of the Jays,
then I'm going to get

708
00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:03.490
our bar zero times I minus our bar zero times Omega one minus r Bar Zero Times

709
00:45:04.981 --> 00:45:08.520
only get to so,
but I can feed that into the other thing.

710
00:45:08.521 --> 00:45:12.030
So I get um,
our zero times the eye.

711
00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:16.800
And then the r one in term is going to be our bar one times omega one minus the

712
00:45:16.801 --> 00:45:21.801
thing that came from subtracting the Omega one there in I minus Omega is by

713
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:27.090
replacing Omega zero with high minus,
uh,
when we go one minus Oma,

714
00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:31.380
good Jay,
etc.
So I'm going to notice all these other terms.

715
00:45:31.381 --> 00:45:36.381
Now I get rid of the constraint and all the other terms get replaced.

716
00:45:36.451 --> 00:45:40.080
Our bar to gets replaced by Arab are two minus our zero.

717
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:44.610
Okay.
And so,
and I've dropped sigma zero because it's zero.

718
00:45:44.611 --> 00:45:48.360
So I'm maximizing something without a constraint by plugging in the constraint

719
00:45:48.361 --> 00:45:50.100
and to Omega Zero.
Okay?

720
00:45:50.101 --> 00:45:54.810
So I have to choose my only go one through only good Jay.
Um,

721
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:58.560
and then Omega zero is determined from that,
but I'm maximizing one thing.

722
00:45:58.561 --> 00:46:02.070
So I just take the derivative with respect to each Omega I and set it equal to

723
00:46:02.071 --> 00:46:06.900
zero.
So with respect to Omega one,
say it's going to be our one bar,

724
00:46:06.901 --> 00:46:07.970
one minus r bars,

725
00:46:07.971 --> 00:46:12.971
zero minus two Alpha Sigma to differentiate with respect to Omega one.

726
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:20.510
So it's two Alpha Omega one time sigma one squared to Alpha Omega one time sigma

727
00:46:21.841 --> 00:46:24.180
one squared equals zero.
Okay,

728
00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:29.181
so therefore Omega one equals r one minus r zero over to Alpha Sigma one

729
00:46:29.761 --> 00:46:34.590
squared.
But if I did it now with respect to two or to three or to four nothing,

730
00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:38.430
I would get the same formula just with Ajay instead of a one.
Okay,

731
00:46:38.431 --> 00:46:42.960
so that's the formula everybody picks and notice it depends on what Alpha is.

732
00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:44.920
So people with different Alphas,

733
00:46:44.921 --> 00:46:48.870
they're going to put different amounts of money and oh my God,
Jay,
okay.

734
00:46:48.871 --> 00:46:52.830
But it depends on Alpha and a very trivial way.

735
00:46:52.831 --> 00:46:56.970
So if I took the,
the fraction,
the relative amounts of money,

736
00:46:56.971 --> 00:47:01.971
I put an I in j and divided this by Omega I by Omega Jay,

737
00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:05.940
I would get that the Alphas and the twos canceled out.

738
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:11.150
So everybody would put our I minus our bar zero divided by Sigma I squared r Bar

739
00:47:12.031 --> 00:47:14.220
j minus Arzeo over sigma squared.
Jay,

740
00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.500
that number doesn't depend on who the person is.

741
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:20.670
So the relative amounts of money and put an I and j are independent of what your

742
00:47:20.671 --> 00:47:25.050
Alpha is independent of the person.
So unlike this old Markowitz case,

743
00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:30.200
the Tobin case looks like that and everybody chooses the combination of risky

744
00:47:30.431 --> 00:47:33.550
assets and then Russ safe acid.

745
00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:37.270
So maybe the different people put different combinations of safe and risky,

746
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:42.340
but everybody's proportion of risky assets is proportional to everybody else's.

747
00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:46.150
That's what we just proved algebraically.
So graphically and Algebraically,

748
00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:50.020
graphically,
a sort of general proof algebraically,
a special case.

749
00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:51.880
And then if you were in a graduate class,

750
00:47:51.881 --> 00:47:54.610
you'd get an algebraic proof in general,

751
00:47:54.611 --> 00:47:56.560
which is actually much faster than these were the east,

752
00:47:56.561 --> 00:48:00.640
but you'd have to know a little less linear Algebra.
And so that's the proof.

753
00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:04.330
It's a very simple thing.
Okay.
It's a remarkable thing.

754
00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:08.830
And here's the famous Tobin diagram.
Everybody should do that,

755
00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:13.390
put their money in the same combination of risky assets and the riskless acid.

756
00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:16.630
Okay.
Are there any questions about this?

757
00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:24.010
It's kind of shocking.
You know,
I could swear that,
uh,

758
00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:27.460
most people think maybe even rightly that,
you know,

759
00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:30.160
if you really want to go for it,
you know,

760
00:48:30.161 --> 00:48:34.930
put your money in the young Microsoft or something.
Um,
you know,

761
00:48:34.931 --> 00:48:38.140
it could be a tremendous success or it could go out of business.

762
00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:40.990
That's what she should do.
But no,
this says not at all.

763
00:48:40.991 --> 00:48:44.860
If you really want to go for it,
take the same index that everybody,

764
00:48:44.861 --> 00:48:47.290
the s and p 500 and just leverage it,

765
00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:51.430
borrow a lot of money and go out that straight line way out to there to the

766
00:48:51.431 --> 00:48:53.230
right.
Don't put your money in Microsoft.

767
00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:56.530
Just leverage the hell out of the s and p 500.

768
00:48:57.730 --> 00:48:58.160
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

769
00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:02.470
<v 0>Okay.
So after this theory was created and we're going to talk,
I'm gonna,</v>

770
00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:05.990
you know,
tease out all the implications of it.
After this theory was created,

771
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:10.460
the Mutual Fund business took off vanguard and all these places.

772
00:49:10.461 --> 00:49:12.920
What did they do?
They said,
look,

773
00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:17.900
economic science has taught us the best you can do is not try to pick individual

774
00:49:17.901 --> 00:49:22.670
stocks.
The best you can do is to hold the same index,

775
00:49:22.671 --> 00:49:23.510
the whole market.

776
00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:26.210
Now of course it's very expensive for you to hold the whole market or you're

777
00:49:26.211 --> 00:49:27.530
going to go to a broker and tell him,

778
00:49:27.531 --> 00:49:30.770
buy me three shares of this and seven shares of that at nine shares of that,

779
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:34.010
14 shares of that.
It'll take the guy forever to buy all that stuff.

780
00:49:34.011 --> 00:49:36.620
And you have to pay a commission on every single single thing you buy.

781
00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:39.710
It's going to cost you so much money to do what economic science says.

782
00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:43.370
Come to us at vanguard.
We'll buy the whole market for you.

783
00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:47.090
Call it our index fund and charge you almost no commission at all.

784
00:49:47.091 --> 00:49:50.330
Just a tiny little bit.
And you know,
cause we're doing it in such bulk,

785
00:49:50.331 --> 00:49:52.850
everyone's going,
you know,
cause we've got lots of investors like you.

786
00:49:52.851 --> 00:49:55.400
They're all buying the same thing.
We have huge volumes.

787
00:49:55.401 --> 00:50:00.020
So we're going to get a really a small brokerage fee.
And so,
uh,

788
00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:03.650
you should put your money in with us.
So that's what everybody started to do.

789
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:06.440
So all these mutual funds and money managers,

790
00:50:06.441 --> 00:50:11.441
they all grew up originally by guaranteeing to produce an index fund.

791
00:50:12.081 --> 00:50:16.790
The very same thing,
economic science recommended at almost no cost.

792
00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:19.940
If you read Swenson,
spork and you,
and he said,
you know,

793
00:50:19.941 --> 00:50:22.370
his first most important piece of advice,

794
00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:26.300
if you're a standard investor who doesn't know how to,
you know,

795
00:50:26.301 --> 00:50:30.410
manipulate all complicated instruments on Wall Street and has transactions costs

796
00:50:30.411 --> 00:50:33.680
and things like that,
put all your money into an index.

797
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:36.140
That's what he recommends doing.
And he says,

798
00:50:36.141 --> 00:50:39.020
everyone else who tells you otherwise is just trying to steal your money,

799
00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:40.183
rip you off.

800
00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:44.510
So that's the main financial advice that um,

801
00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:47.750
economists give.
Now it's Shakespeare's advice,

802
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:54.050
okay,
don't put all your eggs in one basket,
but it's very specific.

803
00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:57.810
Put it in an index.
Where will you buy everything,
uh,

804
00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:59.840
in the same proportion?
Now of course,

805
00:50:59.841 --> 00:51:03.320
if you're buying everything in the same proportion and everybody's doing that,

806
00:51:03.321 --> 00:51:04.580
what does this have to be?

807
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:09.380
So I forgot to say that if everybody's buying every stock in the same
proportion,

808
00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:12.680
that proportion must be the market because that's what everybody's holding.

809
00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:17.300
So this doesn't turn out to be any old portfolio.
It's the market portfolio.

810
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:21.170
So the index,
that's a huge conclusion here,

811
00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:25.070
that the index that they should offer is not just some magical index that's

812
00:51:25.071 --> 00:51:27.800
better than everything else.
Because if everyone is doing the right thing,

813
00:51:27.801 --> 00:51:30.740
everyone's choosing the right in the same index.
That's what we proved.

814
00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:32.780
If everyone's choosing the same index,

815
00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:36.580
it must be the market index because that's all there is to choose suppliers to

816
00:51:36.581 --> 00:51:38.830
equal demand.
So therefore the,
the,

817
00:51:38.831 --> 00:51:42.590
the advice is to put all your money into the market index,

818
00:51:42.591 --> 00:51:47.591
not just unindexed the market index plus maybe put money in a bank or even

819
00:51:50.931 --> 00:51:53.450
borrow from a bank to put it into the market index.

820
00:51:55.310 --> 00:51:56.630
That's the first,
uh,

821
00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:01.370
surprising ferrum that Tobin approved.
And it had dramatic,

822
00:52:01.371 --> 00:52:05.340
a dramatic.
So we created the,
you know,

823
00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:08.200
indexed investments,
a created vanguard.

824
00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:11.570
And so these people who run these companies forgot the guy's name,

825
00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:15.140
who runs vanguard.
He's always giving these speeches.
Um,

826
00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:17.750
so that's how he describes how he got his start in his business.

827
00:52:17.751 --> 00:52:21.860
All he says is I take all the recommendations of economic science.
He says,

828
00:52:21.861 --> 00:52:24.890
and I allow people to carry them out.
That's why I'm doing great.

829
00:52:24.891 --> 00:52:28.400
Good for society or everybody else.
All these hedge funds and stuff,

830
00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:32.570
they're ruining society.
I am just doing what Tobin told us to do that.

831
00:52:32.571 --> 00:52:36.230
That's his basic speech.
Um,
okay.

832
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:39.950
So Markowitz was a little bit more precise even than that.

833
00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:42.950
The woods formula and Tobin special case,

834
00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:47.180
he not only told you what to do,
he told you,
you know,

835
00:52:47.181 --> 00:52:51.140
do what everyone else is doing,
but he told you what that should be.
Okay.

836
00:52:51.141 --> 00:52:54.920
So let's suppose that I've got two stocks,

837
00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:58.370
I and J with the same,
um,

838
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:02.150
same return,
same expected return,

839
00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:06.920
but one has a standard deviation,
three times higher than the other.

840
00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:12.410
Okay?
So in my picture here,
that standard picture,

841
00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:15.800
we've got the standard deviation.
We've got the expectation,

842
00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:17.750
we've got one stock here,

843
00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:22.850
and we've got another stock here with three times the standard deviation.

844
00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:27.120
Okay?
So you might've thought,
well,
these stocks,
same expected return.

845
00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:30.720
What's the difference?
Put all my money in one or the other.
Doesn't matter.

846
00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:33.240
I'm a little bit further thought.
Would say,
well,

847
00:53:33.241 --> 00:53:35.100
this one is much better than that one.
I,
you know,

848
00:53:35.101 --> 00:53:38.910
I've got smaller standard deviation,
so I should put all my money into this one.

849
00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:40.860
But then on further thought,

850
00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:45.750
given that these two are independent,
so they're independent,

851
00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:46.890
what should you do?

852
00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:50.540
How should you allocate your money between this stock and that stock?

853
00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:55.500
What is the formula tells you to do?

854
00:53:58.990 --> 00:53:59.823
Very clear.

855
00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:01.673
<v 2>Okay,</v>

856
00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:10.350
<v 0>well this is the</v>

857
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:16.020
ratio of money in one stock to the other stock looks like this ratio,

858
00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:20.190
but I've told you that the expectations and the two stocks are the same.

859
00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:22.560
So those things are the same and I've totally,

860
00:54:22.561 --> 00:54:25.860
that one has three times the standard deviation than the other.
So therefore,

861
00:54:25.861 --> 00:54:26.694
what should you do?

862
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.983
<v 2>Yup,</v>

863
00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:46.730
<v 0>exactly.
You shouldn't hold put 90% in this stock,</v>

864
00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:51.920
10% of that stock.
That's it.
Okay.

865
00:54:51.921 --> 00:54:55.490
Because if one sigma three times the other and you squared,

866
00:54:55.491 --> 00:54:58.610
it's going to be nine times the other.
And so obviously you're putting it,

867
00:54:58.611 --> 00:54:58.821
you know,

868
00:54:58.821 --> 00:55:01.160
and then you have to figure out what's in the numerator and what's in the

869
00:55:01.161 --> 00:55:01.994
denominator.

870
00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:04.940
But clearly you're going to put more of your money in the lower standard

871
00:55:04.941 --> 00:55:09.920
deviation.
So it's 90 10 okay.
So it's very concrete advice.
Okay.

872
00:55:09.921 --> 00:55:14.921
So the first concrete advice is first concrete thing we've gotten out of this is

873
00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:20.310
by the index.
Okay?

874
00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:23.560
Now the index,
typically in America there,

875
00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:27.270
they're easy to buy our indexes of stocks.
But you know,

876
00:55:27.271 --> 00:55:31.610
the second piece of advices,
and,
and this is also Swenson.

877
00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:34.230
Second most important point.
I mean,

878
00:55:34.610 --> 00:55:36.750
I'm quoting Swenson because we're here at Yale,

879
00:55:36.751 --> 00:55:38.970
not because he's the only one to recognize these things,

880
00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:43.950
but he was a student of Tobin.
So the second important point is that,
um,

881
00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:48.690
you should not just buy the index because the index is,
or the wrong index.

882
00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:52.710
The index should be the index of everything.
It should include American stocks,

883
00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:56.940
Chinese stocks,
French stocks,
weak stocks,
Israeli stocks.

884
00:55:56.941 --> 00:55:58.650
You should have all stocks in the index,

885
00:55:58.651 --> 00:56:01.680
but you can't really very easily by all those other things.

886
00:56:01.890 --> 00:56:05.250
You can only very easily by index of American things.

887
00:56:05.251 --> 00:56:08.670
It's getting easier and easier now to buy into,
you know,
the global index.

888
00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:13.590
But anyway,
you shouldn't buy the global index.
That's what this says.

889
00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:18.660
Okay?
So every time you find a new independent risk,
you should look for it.

890
00:56:18.661 --> 00:56:22.530
So you should buy the global index,
seek out independent risks.

891
00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:27.240
So what did Swensen do?

892
00:56:27.690 --> 00:56:31.830
One of his most important things was Yale is always looking globally to find

893
00:56:31.831 --> 00:56:35.080
independent risks.
So let's go back to the uh,

894
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:39.930
okay.
So you should always find independent risks.
Okay?

895
00:56:39.931 --> 00:56:43.800
And you suffer if you don't.
So you see by putting 90% here and 10% here,

896
00:56:43.801 --> 00:56:47.700
Marcos is telling you you're going to do better.
So,
all right,

897
00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:52.290
what else do I have to say?
Um,

898
00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:58.910
okay.
So let's try and go back to our dice example.

899
00:56:59.210 --> 00:57:03.620
Suppose that you had a one dice.

900
00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:08.960
Now,
by the way,
I want to introduce one more term.
Okay?

901
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:13.370
So which I'll call the Sharpe ratio.
So the slope of this line,

902
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:20.500
so it's the Tobin diagram.
It shouldn't be called the Tobin ratio.

903
00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:22.780
What's this other guy had?

904
00:57:22.781 --> 00:57:27.781
Stanford's snuck in and managed to give his name to it and he ended up getting a

905
00:57:28.601 --> 00:57:33.250
Nobel prize too.
Um,
so he,
so here,
this,
this line,

906
00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:38.500
the slope of this line,
this is the riskless asset.
Okay?
The slope of this line.

907
00:57:38.501 --> 00:57:42.370
What is the slope of this line?
So this is standard deviation.

908
00:57:42.371 --> 00:57:46.270
This is expectation and the slope,
what's the slope?

909
00:57:47.350 --> 00:57:51.850
Well,
it's the expectation of whatever you're holding.

910
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:54.880
X minus the riskless asset.

911
00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:58.050
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

912
00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:02.280
<v 0>Okay.
Divided by the standard deviation of x,</v>

913
00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:06.410
that's the Sharpe ratio of X.
Okay?

914
00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:10.050
So you noticed that every point you could,

915
00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:14.370
could conceivably choose which is somewhere in this blob then connected to the

916
00:58:14.371 --> 00:58:15.330
riskless asset.

917
00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:19.890
So every point on this line obviously has the same sharp ratio.

918
00:58:19.891 --> 00:58:22.110
If you leverage your position and went to here,

919
00:58:22.410 --> 00:58:25.500
you wouldn't change your Sharpe ratio.
It says the same slope.
Okay?

920
00:58:25.501 --> 00:58:27.870
If you put half of your money in the bank and half and the rest of the SAS,

921
00:58:27.871 --> 00:58:29.520
it'd be here saying Sharpe ratio.

922
00:58:31.050 --> 00:58:33.990
Anything else you could do has a lower Sharpe race show.

923
00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:37.920
So another thing to say is that,
uh,
an investor,

924
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:40.460
<v 1>okay.</v>

925
00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:41.900
<v 0>Managing all his money.</v>

926
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:46.063
<v 1>Okay.</v>

927
00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:50.600
<v 0>Should match,
should maximize this sharp ratio.
Max Sharpe ratio.</v>

928
00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:54.243
<v 1>Okay.</v>

929
00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:58.230
<v 0>Okay.
So you could in fact tell if somebody had screwed up.</v>

930
00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:02.220
Instead of doubling doing the global index,
they just did the American index.

931
00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:03.930
You don't pick something here.

932
00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:08.160
You could look at the slope of where they ended up and it would be a worse slope

933
00:59:08.161 --> 00:59:09.360
in a worst Sharpe ratio.

934
00:59:09.361 --> 00:59:12.690
So you can even judge people how they're doing by looking at their Sharpe ratio.

935
00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:15.960
So let's take the case of the two dice.
Okay.

936
00:59:15.961 --> 00:59:20.700
Suppose you had one die.
So if you had one die,

937
00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:21.140
remember,

938
00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:26.140
invest $100 you could get 101 hundred two or three 106 let's say the interest

939
00:59:26.961 --> 00:59:31.370
rate is 3% so,
um,

940
00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:36.640
so you could get 100100200 300400500 six with the sixth probability a sixth

941
00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:43.430
each.
Okay?

942
00:59:43.431 --> 00:59:48.080
So the average of that is obviously 103.5,
right?

943
00:59:48.081 --> 00:59:51.500
Because one in six or seven and divide by two,
the oil 3.5.

944
00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:55.670
So the expected payoff for putting your,

945
00:59:56.060 --> 01:00:01.060
your money into one dice is the average return is 1.035.

946
01:00:01.550 --> 01:00:04.910
The riskless return is going to be 1.03 so,

947
01:00:04.911 --> 01:00:09.911
so it's 0.035 minus 0.0 3.05 and now what's the standard deviation?

948
01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:14.540
What's the variance of this where you could take one oh one minus one oh three

949
01:00:14.541 --> 01:00:17.810
five squared plus one or two minus one or three five squared,
et cetera.

950
01:00:18.050 --> 01:00:22.820
And take the square root of it and you'd get 0.017 okay,

951
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:29.230
so you notice the chance of losing money by the way is 50% 50% of the time

952
01:00:30.381 --> 01:00:35.381
you're going to lose money and your sharp ratio is 0.05 or 0.017 so that's about

953
01:00:37.701 --> 01:00:42.701
3.3 it's about 0.3 now that happens to be the sharp ratio of the stock market

954
01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:46.790
just about shockingly low,
isn't it?

955
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:49.130
If you look at the history of the stock market,

956
01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:51.980
so it depends what year you start and what year you end.

957
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:54.770
You know if you do it right after a crash or before a crash.

958
01:00:54.771 --> 01:00:56.570
But just to pick vague numbers,

959
01:00:56.750 --> 01:01:01.210
it's like 9% and let's say the interest rate is you know,

960
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:04.220
4% something like that.
You know,

961
01:01:04.221 --> 01:01:08.540
it could be 5% or 3% depends again the period.
Okay,

962
01:01:08.541 --> 01:01:11.300
maybe it's 2%.
Okay.
But somewhere like that.

963
01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:14.210
And the standard deviation of the stock market is,
you know,

964
01:01:14.211 --> 01:01:17.840
like 16% or 12% you know,
again,
depending on what period,

965
01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:22.841
but always around 12 to 18% let's say 16% that's the one I like to use because

966
01:01:24.411 --> 01:01:29.300
it's percent a day of a,
okay,
so that,
um,

967
01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:34.460
that's equal to 5% over 16%,
which is about a third.

968
01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:36.890
Hey,
lets you know it's about 0.3.

969
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:40.730
That's exactly what this dice had about 0.3.

970
01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:44.390
So that's all you can get out of the stock market.
Not a very good sharp ratio.

971
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:48.050
So you could measure,
you know,
Swenson Sharpe ratio.

972
01:01:48.051 --> 01:01:50.510
You could measure Ellington Sharpe ratio and see what they are.

973
01:01:50.511 --> 01:01:54.980
You can see who you think is a better manager.
Okay.
So now,
um,

974
01:01:58.050 --> 01:01:59.180
uh,

975
01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.740
so I won't tell you those numbers just yet,

976
01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:08.510
but now let's suppose you,
um,
what else could I do?

977
01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:11.270
Okay,
so let's suppose you put your money in two dice.

978
01:02:11.271 --> 01:02:12.380
That's the whole point of this.

979
01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:15.350
Suppose you put half your money in the first dice and half your money in the

980
01:02:15.351 --> 01:02:20.280
second tie.
Okay?
Now,
what are the chances?
What's going to happen?
Well,
again,

981
01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:25.350
your,
your expected return hasn't changed.
It's still 0.035,

982
01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:29.250
but the sharp ratio has drastically changed.
In fact,

983
01:02:29.251 --> 01:02:33.240
you could see that what are the chances of ending up with $101?
Now,

984
01:02:33.241 --> 01:02:37.020
if you put half of your money in each,
the worst case,
it's not one in six.

985
01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:41.370
You have to get the worst case in both dies.
So to get $101,

986
01:02:41.371 --> 01:02:43.380
it's one in 36.
Okay.

987
01:02:43.381 --> 01:02:47.700
It's vastly less likely that you end up with this extreme bad outcome once you

988
01:02:47.701 --> 01:02:49.500
put half the money in each die.

989
01:02:49.501 --> 01:02:53.490
So if you compute the standard deviation is going to be a lot smaller number.

990
01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:56.730
Okay?
It's going to be 0.01 uh,
I,

991
01:02:57.030 --> 01:03:01.770
it's going to be 0.012 so the Sharpe ratio has gone from 0.3 to 0.4.

992
01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:04.110
Okay.
Just by finding the second die.

993
01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:07.380
So what you should be doing is looking like Swinson does,

994
01:03:07.381 --> 01:03:11.070
like everybody does for those independent risks that the rest of the market is

995
01:03:11.071 --> 01:03:12.150
too stupid to see.

996
01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:16.890
Even after they got the idea of the index for 20 years,

997
01:03:16.891 --> 01:03:19.890
they didn't realize the index should mean everything,
not just in America.

998
01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:23.970
So you'd have a huge opportunity to do better than the rest of the managers.

999
01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:26.940
You know,
while everybody else is screwing around on this line,

1000
01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:32.240
you can be screwing around on that wine so you could run the same risk this guy

1001
01:03:32.281 --> 01:03:36.270
did.
Okay?
So if you're Swinson say you could leverage,

1002
01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:37.291
not that he does,

1003
01:03:37.291 --> 01:03:39.990
but if you're a Harvard and you're on this thing instead of this thing,

1004
01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:42.570
you could leverage and go up a here and you can say,
look,

1005
01:03:42.810 --> 01:03:47.010
I've got the same standard deviation everybody else does.
And look at my returns.

1006
01:03:47.011 --> 01:03:49.620
There's so much higher than everybody else's.
Okay.

1007
01:03:49.621 --> 01:03:54.270
So that's what Harvard is trying to do.
They're trying to globally diversify,

1008
01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:56.040
cut down their standard deviation,

1009
01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:57.960
and then leverage and compare it to everybody else.

1010
01:03:57.961 --> 01:04:01.860
Get a higher return with the same standard deviation.
Okay?

1011
01:04:01.861 --> 01:04:03.570
So that's the first implication of the theory.

1012
01:04:03.571 --> 01:04:08.410
Now the second application is the best part.
Let's hope I get to it.
Um,

1013
01:04:11.110 --> 01:04:12.820
okay,
so I'm going to skip over leverage.

1014
01:04:13.030 --> 01:04:17.860
So the second and the second story is a coming right up.

1015
01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:23.590
Okay.
How are these things priced?
Hope this.
Okay,

1016
01:04:23.650 --> 01:04:28.330
so I have to get to the second part of Shakespeare.
Okay.

1017
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:31.480
What can we say about the pricing of individual stocks?

1018
01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:36.280
Now it looks like an individual stock is going to be worth more if it

1019
01:04:36.281 --> 01:04:38.920
contributes.
No variance,
less variance.

1020
01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:44.230
But that turns out to be completely wrong and it's shocking that that's wrong.

1021
01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:49.240
Okay,
so why is this?
Well,

1022
01:04:49.810 --> 01:04:53.860
the crucial thing is,
remember back to our first principles.

1023
01:04:54.010 --> 01:04:55.540
What is price equal to?

1024
01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:00.220
What's the key ingredient to price?
What does it always equal?

1025
01:05:00.221 --> 01:05:03.010
Two and basic economics.

1026
01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.880
Supply and demand.
Okay.

1027
01:05:05.881 --> 01:05:10.881
But if an individual is going to buy so that price is equal to his marginal

1028
01:05:11.191 --> 01:05:14.220
utility,
right?
So we have to figure out,

1029
01:05:14.221 --> 01:05:19.221
so what we've shown so far is that everybody is holding the market.

1030
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:26.470
Everybody's uh,
right.

1031
01:05:26.471 --> 01:05:30.280
Holding a market maybe with some riskless acid.
Okay?

1032
01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:35.080
So they're holding the market.
Plus maybe there are long or short the bonds,

1033
01:05:35.081 --> 01:05:38.290
but that's not creating any covariance.
So if I ask,

1034
01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:42.900
if I'm holding the market and I hold a little bit more of a stock,
okay,
so I,

1035
01:05:42.901 --> 01:05:46.360
if I could pay a little bit more and by t units of stock x,

1036
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:49.390
what good would it do me?
Well,
the expectation,

1037
01:05:49.391 --> 01:05:54.391
the change in expectation with ti dollars of x would be is I increased t a

1038
01:05:55.331 --> 01:05:59.830
little bit.
The derivative.
Why expectations?
Just the expectation of X.
Okay.

1039
01:05:59.831 --> 01:06:04.120
So by holding the new stock,
I get expectation of,

1040
01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:09.040
I get a little more,
I get t times the expectation of x by hope putting,

1041
01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:10.930
if I came up with t extra dollars,

1042
01:06:10.931 --> 01:06:15.880
I could increase my expectation by t times the expectation of acts obviously.

1043
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:19.420
But what would happen to my variance?
Well look at the variance of this.

1044
01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:23.920
What happens to my variance?
Okay.

1045
01:06:23.921 --> 01:06:28.921
Which is equal Bavarians I could write as the covariance of this with itself.

1046
01:06:30.550 --> 01:06:35.550
T x plus M.

1047
01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:39.230
Okay,
so I'm taking,
right,
I want to see,

1048
01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:43.880
everybody's supposed to hold em plus some risk was thing negative or positive in

1049
01:06:43.881 --> 01:06:46.890
the bond.
Okay.
Or,
but

1050
01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:52.050
the negative or positive and the bond is riskless asset that contributes nothing

1051
01:06:52.051 --> 01:06:52.900
to the covariance.

1052
01:06:52.901 --> 01:06:56.040
So I might as well just look at the covariance of a little bit of money in acts

1053
01:06:56.250 --> 01:07:00.210
with the market.
And what's that covariance going to be?
Well,

1054
01:07:00.211 --> 01:07:04.680
it's covariance of t,
TX and Tx,

1055
01:07:04.681 --> 01:07:09.550
covariance of TX and,
and uh,
m
hey,

1056
01:07:09.551 --> 01:07:14.170
these are definitely not zero anymore.
Okay.
Plus covariance of,

1057
01:07:14.171 --> 01:07:17.260
uh,
of,
um,
so it's too

1058
01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:25.140
two t covariance of TX and m and then it's the,

1059
01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:29.830
uh,
plus covariance of m with itself.

1060
01:07:31.310 --> 01:07:33.650
Okay.
So it's the covariance of TX with itself,

1061
01:07:33.651 --> 01:07:38.651
TX with TX twice the coal branch of TX with m and the miss TX x with them to

1062
01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:42.170
covariance TX with them.
And the covariance of am with itself.

1063
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:46.750
And I want to differentiate that thing with respect to t.

1064
01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:49.460
If I put just a little bit of money that's being on the margin,

1065
01:07:49.461 --> 01:07:53.600
what's the marginal effect on my variance?
Right?
I hate variance.

1066
01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:58.870
But see the mistake people have made in the past is they said people hate

1067
01:07:59.481 --> 01:08:02.480
variants,
therefore a stock that has a lot of variances,
bad,

1068
01:08:02.810 --> 01:08:04.310
absolutely wrong reasoning.

1069
01:08:04.550 --> 01:08:07.460
That was Adam Smith's puzzle about water and diamonds.
You know,

1070
01:08:07.461 --> 01:08:10.430
why is water or less expensive than diamonds when water is so much more

1071
01:08:10.431 --> 01:08:13.370
important?
It's not how important the whole thing is,

1072
01:08:13.371 --> 01:08:17.600
is how important one tiny job of it is the margin utility.

1073
01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:20.660
So if you had a tiny bit of x to what you're already holding,

1074
01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.730
which might involve a bunch of ex already,

1075
01:08:22.731 --> 01:08:25.970
she had a tiny bit more of to what all you're already holding,

1076
01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:28.250
what's going to be the change in your variants?

1077
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:32.660
So it's the derivative of this with respect to t when t equals zero.
Okay?

1078
01:08:32.661 --> 01:08:33.950
So this by the way,

1079
01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:39.040
equals t squared variance of x plus two covariance to t

1080
01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:49.490
times the covariance of x and m plus the variance of m.
Okay?

1081
01:08:49.491 --> 01:08:52.310
And I'm differentiating this with respect to t

1082
01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:58.630
but if I different,
right cause that's what I've just rewritten the same thing.

1083
01:08:58.631 --> 01:09:00.700
That's this as t squared,
the variance of x,

1084
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.080
the tea comes out to tea covariance of x with them and here's the variance of m.

1085
01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.600
But if I differentiate with respect to t,

1086
01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:10.840
I get to t variance of X.

1087
01:09:10.841 --> 01:09:13.180
Remember it's the derivative when t is zero.

1088
01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:19.780
Hey two t variance of x plus two covariance

1089
01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:25.840
of x and m plus zero because the variance of m doesn't depend on t.

1090
01:09:26.350 --> 01:09:29.350
So at t equals zero.
This is also zero.

1091
01:09:29.890 --> 01:09:34.890
So you see the change in my variance when I add a little more of x is twice the

1092
01:09:35.381 --> 01:09:39.250
covariance of x and m.
So what is it that acts adds?

1093
01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:44.280
It adds some expectation and it also adds some variance but not according to the

1094
01:09:44.591 --> 01:09:48.970
variance of x according to the covariance of x.
With him,
when I add some more,

1095
01:09:48.971 --> 01:09:53.470
the price of water is how much extra utility I get given what I've already got,

1096
01:09:53.471 --> 01:09:55.030
I've already got a huge amount of water.

1097
01:09:55.031 --> 01:09:57.370
That's why an extra amount of water is not doing much for me.

1098
01:09:57.371 --> 01:10:01.540
That's why the price is low.
So x itself might be very dangerous,

1099
01:10:01.690 --> 01:10:04.870
but if it's independent of all the other stuff,
em,
that you're holding,

1100
01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.940
in fact you're only adding a drop of it.

1101
01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:10.330
It won't change your variants hardly at all.
In fact,
it will make it,
you know,

1102
01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:13.510
and so it's uh,
this is zero.
Okay?

1103
01:10:13.511 --> 01:10:16.660
So it's the covariants.
All right?

1104
01:10:16.661 --> 01:10:21.490
So that's the crucial idea that the marginal contribution of every stock depends

1105
01:10:21.491 --> 01:10:25.870
on its expectation and it's covariants not its variants.

1106
01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:29.560
And the expectation is good and the covariance is bad.

1107
01:10:29.770 --> 01:10:33.910
And all of this is linear because it's differentiable.
So it just says that,

1108
01:10:33.911 --> 01:10:37.270
you know,
this is the change and covariance.
So you know,
remember the guy,

1109
01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:42.550
the margin utility of expectation.
So the margin you,
how am I doing in time?

1110
01:10:42.551 --> 01:10:44.040
Okay,
one more minute.
Margie.

1111
01:10:44.041 --> 01:10:48.940
Chili of expectation times the expectation of X.
That's the change.

1112
01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:51.280
When you add a dollars,
we're a tiny bit of ax.

1113
01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:54.190
Your expectation goes up by the expectation of x.

1114
01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:57.790
So this is the margin utility of expectation,
which is the good thing,

1115
01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:01.840
minus the margin utility of variant variance.
That's the bad thing.

1116
01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:05.500
And what's the change?
The thing that affects the,
uh,

1117
01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:11.400
the thing that affects the contribution to variance is the covariance of x with

1118
01:11:11.441 --> 01:11:12.970
them.
Okay.

1119
01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:18.230
The punchline is air me buddy has a linear tradeoff between expectation and

1120
01:11:19.021 --> 01:11:22.200
covariance.
Okay?
So for any fixed person,

1121
01:11:22.201 --> 01:11:27.201
it's just a US constant times the expectation of x minus a constant times.

1122
01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:29.040
This doesn't depend on the portfolio.

1123
01:11:29.041 --> 01:11:32.480
This is the large utility at his consumption.
Margie,

1124
01:11:32.481 --> 01:11:34.930
utility of expectation at his consumption.
You,

1125
01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:39.080
you face him with any possible new thing that he could buy just like a consumer.

1126
01:11:39.081 --> 01:11:41.820
And the first day of class,
he could buy apples,
you could buy oranges,

1127
01:11:41.821 --> 01:11:42.690
you could buy pairs.

1128
01:11:42.810 --> 01:11:45.990
The Mars utility of each one of those at the point he's already chosen to

1129
01:11:45.991 --> 01:11:47.730
consume.
This is a number that's fixed.

1130
01:11:47.731 --> 01:11:51.150
This is a number of them fixed whatever x I put in here,
that's what I get.

1131
01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:56.010
So there's a linear tradeoff between expectation and covariance.
Expectation.

1132
01:11:56.011 --> 01:12:00.480
Good.
Covariance bad.
So the final picture is that INAC,
Librium,

1133
01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:05.460
what you should have is every stock,

1134
01:12:06.330 --> 01:12:09.900
and this is called the security market line.
This is the expectation of x.

1135
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.740
This is the covariance of x with Em.

1136
01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.880
So what we found is that it should look like this and there has to be a linear

1137
01:12:17.881 --> 01:12:21.570
relationship in order to want a stock.

1138
01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:25.230
If it's got a higher covariance,
that means it's adding bad stuff.

1139
01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:28.980
You wouldn't want it unless it had a higher expectation.
Okay?

1140
01:12:28.981 --> 01:12:32.100
So here's the risk was here's the riskless asset right here.

1141
01:12:32.250 --> 01:12:36.720
So this is a different diagram then the Tobin diary on his expectation and

1142
01:12:36.721 --> 01:12:40.260
covariance.
Every stock is along this line,

1143
01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:46.670
okay?
Should be priced along this line.
So let me,
um,

1144
01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:50.630
uh,
and with a puzzle,

1145
01:12:50.631 --> 01:12:54.620
the one we started with on the first day of class,
if I have two companies,

1146
01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:58.370
General Motors and AIDS,
I anti AIDS company,

1147
01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:03.140
some scientists at Yale discovers a cure for aids.
He calls an aids.
Okay,

1148
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:07.940
here's this cover is a cure for aids.
If the thing works,
he'll make a fortune.

1149
01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:10.850
If the thing doesn't work,
of course it's going to go bankrupt.

1150
01:13:10.851 --> 01:13:11.990
And pay anyone no money.

1151
01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:16.100
Let's say we calculate the expected profits of General Electric,
not jump.

1152
01:13:16.101 --> 01:13:19.520
General orders is to junkie now General Electric and let's say the expected

1153
01:13:19.521 --> 01:13:24.140
profits of general electric equal the expected profits of the anti AIDS company,

1154
01:13:25.190 --> 01:13:27.080
which will sell for a higher price.

1155
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:35.143
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1156
01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:37.270
<v 0>we'll sell for a higher price.
Why?</v>

1157
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:39.343
<v 2>Very good.</v>

1158
01:13:40.230 --> 01:13:43.860
<v 0>Okay.
That's what you should have said at the beginning of class,</v>

1159
01:13:43.861 --> 01:13:46.680
but not at the end of class.
Who's saying that?
That's,
you're down here.

1160
01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:50.180
Who said that?
Who's your just who just said that I,

1161
01:13:50.181 --> 01:13:52.560
I don't wanna embarrass anyone by right.
You're anonymous.

1162
01:13:52.561 --> 01:13:54.780
I didn't see how it was.
So that's exactly,

1163
01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:58.380
that's what you would've thought before this class began.

1164
01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:02.310
Everybody hates variance.
The AIDS company is so risky.
It's,
you know,

1165
01:14:02.311 --> 01:14:05.130
you could get a fortune or zero,
you couldn't get riskier than that.

1166
01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:09.440
General Electric is not going to go bankrupt very easily and it's not gonna,

1167
01:14:09.450 --> 01:14:14.200
you know,
suddenly multiply value by a hundred times either.
It's much more solid.

1168
01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:17.800
So,
which would you pay more for?
Everyone at the beginning of the class,

1169
01:14:17.801 --> 01:14:19.440
I think would have said like he did well,

1170
01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:23.380
whoever he is would've said General Electric you'd pay more for,

1171
01:14:23.410 --> 01:14:27.280
but the answer is not General Electric.
Why is that?
Yes.

1172
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:35.833
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1173
01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.650
<v 0>Exactly.
That's the shocking fact.</v>

1174
01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:43.790
That's the shocking conclusion that so Shakespeare,
yes.
Nothing ventured,

1175
01:14:43.791 --> 01:14:47.390
nothing gained.
You have to take a risk to expect a higher return.

1176
01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:50.280
Everyone would've thought it's the,

1177
01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:53.690
everyone would have thought that's the AIDS company.
Anti-Aids Company.

1178
01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:56.780
No it's not.
And Shakespeare couldn't possibly have figured this out.

1179
01:14:56.990 --> 01:15:01.990
It's general electric is the one with the higher risk because it's correlated

1180
01:15:02.090 --> 01:15:04.760
with the market.
Okay.
It's correlated with the market.

1181
01:15:04.761 --> 01:15:06.150
Obviously if people are richer,

1182
01:15:06.151 --> 01:15:09.870
they're gonna buy more refrigerators and engines and stuff like that.
If people,

1183
01:15:10.110 --> 01:15:12.560
you know,
businesses and doing very well,
they're not going to buy that stuff.

1184
01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:17.180
It's very correlated with the market.
Anti-Aids you know,
if a cure is aids,

1185
01:15:17.181 --> 01:15:18.740
people are going to buy it.
If they've got aids,

1186
01:15:18.741 --> 01:15:20.540
they're going to buy it no matter what their,
you know,
and the,

1187
01:15:20.541 --> 01:15:23.180
otherwise they won't.
So it's uncorrelated with the market.

1188
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:26.870
So therefore the price of the AIDS company is going to be,

1189
01:15:26.871 --> 01:15:29.000
it's expected payoff discounted.

1190
01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:32.330
The price of General Motors is going to be much less because it's going to be

1191
01:15:32.331 --> 01:15:35.660
punished for having a correlation with the market.
Therefore,

1192
01:15:35.661 --> 01:15:39.080
the return on General Electric is going to be much higher because the same

1193
01:15:39.081 --> 01:15:42.040
expected payoff and a lower price.
It's going to you,

1194
01:15:42.090 --> 01:15:44.450
your return's going to be higher in general electric.

1195
01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:47.990
That's the shocking thing that Shakespeare couldn't have noticed.
So yes,

1196
01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:50.210
we're just doing what Shakespeare said from the beginning,

1197
01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:54.890
but in a way he couldn't possibly have done without any mathematics.
Uh,
okay,

1198
01:15:54.891 --> 01:15:59.870
so now the problem set,
I,
you'll have to see if he can do the problem set.

1199
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:03.890
It's due on Tuesday.
