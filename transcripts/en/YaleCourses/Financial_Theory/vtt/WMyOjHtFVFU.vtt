1
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.970
Okay.
Today we're going to talk a little bit more about social security.

2
00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:10.710
Social Security remembers the biggest,
uh,
program.
The government runs.

3
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.760
Its annual expenditures are slightly bigger than the military expenditures every

4
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.930
year.
And those two things are way bigger than everything else.

5
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.220
It's been the biggest program the government's run since,
uh,

6
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:27.600
the new deal since Franklin Delano Roosevelt put it into a fact in the late

7
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:31.320
1930s,
uh,
and it seems to be broke.

8
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.330
So it lasted for 70 years and now it seems on the verge of going broke.

9
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.050
So what happened and how can we fix it?
And as I said,

10
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:42.570
this has been a topic of conversation.

11
00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:45.300
Presidential conversation at least since 2000.

12
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:50.100
There were a bunch of commissions before that.
Looking at the problem and the,

13
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.420
what I said last time was the general public and our politicians seem completely

14
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.580
confused about what's going on.

15
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.440
So we need to figure out how could it be that the program went broke?
Was that a,

16
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:04.740
should that have been a surprise?
And how can we fix it?

17
00:01:04.741 --> 00:01:09.741
And the three standard things everybody says is President Bush and many people

18
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:13.500
like him saying,
well,
the system's going broke.

19
00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:16.590
The rate of return young people like you are going to get is,
you know,

20
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.850
less than 2% a year.
That's terrible.
Any bond,
any stock,

21
00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:25.500
you can expect a much higher return than that.
So the program's just awful.
Uh,

22
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.200
we should stop it or prioritize it.

23
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.190
So I'll explain what privatizing means in that way.
Your money,

24
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:36.180
instead of going to old people will be put in the stock market and you'll get a

25
00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:39.180
higher rate of return and you'll do much better.
Um,

26
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.910
then a second thing people say is,
well,
the thing lasted all this time.
I mean,

27
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:49.110
what's really gone different?
What's,
what could possibly have caused the change?

28
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.950
It must be those dastardly,
um,

29
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.020
baby boom generation ors,
uh,

30
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.100
like me who are headed towards retirement and another 20 or 30 years and they're

31
00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:02.130
going to bankrupt the system that are going to be so many of those old geezers

32
00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:05.850
hanging around needing to get paid that young people like you won't be able to

33
00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:10.200
carry the burden.
And so it's our fault.
And then they're the people,

34
00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:14.430
the naysayers,
a Gore,
uh,
chief among them,
but many others.

35
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.470
Obama.
Now similarly sayings,
a slightly similar things saying,
well,

36
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:21.360
privatization doesn't make any sense.

37
00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:24.100
It's logically impossible because if you take the,

38
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.070
the taxes that the young people are paying and tell them those social security

39
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:31.290
taxes,
they can invest in private accounts,

40
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.410
those stock market with their own name on it.
Uh,

41
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.720
then how are we going to give money to the old people now?

42
00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:40.380
So you'll just be screwing the old generation.
So privatization is impossible.

43
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.350
So those are the three most standard things people say.

44
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:45.480
All three of them have some truth to them,

45
00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:49.470
but on the whole are substantially wrong,
completely wrong.

46
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.730
And once we clarify what stage the system is in,

47
00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:55.770
we'll be able to think about what the right solution is.

48
00:02:55.771 --> 00:02:58.230
I'm going to tell you my solution,
which as I said,

49
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.620
is not a universally admired,
but uh,

50
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:05.450
I'll see what you think about it.
So the program,
uh,

51
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.780
came into effect in what was the,
the,
the greatest,
uh,
or the,

52
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.080
the biggest of the new deal advances made by FDR.

53
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:14.914
And I just thought I'd,

54
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.780
I play this tape of him signing it into law.

55
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.770
And behind him is the secretary of Labor.
Frances Perkins,

56
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.710
who you'll see in a second,
played a huge role in this.

57
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:31.360
And she was the first woman in the cabinet.
And by the way,
in my generation,

58
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.300
there are many women named Francis,
uh,

59
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.630
because they were their parents named them after her.

60
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.230
So here's the,
uh,
let's see if this works.

61
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.940
Okay.
Well,
it was regarded as a storage for all time and,
uh,

62
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.060
let me now explain what social security does and what the rules are and,

63
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.870
um,
I have to open another file.

64
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.450
<v 2>Okay.
Hmm.</v>

65
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.090
Forgot where I put hope.
It's,
I wonder whether it's,

66
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.260
<v 0>sorry,
I opened the wrong year.
I see.
I'm living in the past.</v>

67
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.370
<v 2>All right.
I'm sorry.
That was last.</v>

68
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.100
Hmm.

69
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.190
<v 0>Okay.
So</v>

70
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.970
we went through all this last time.
All right.

71
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.620
So after passing legislation,

72
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.520
a massive publicity campaign was launched,

73
00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:05.180
convincing people that this was a good idea and not everybody thought it was

74
00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:08.820
such a good idea by the way.
And so,
um,
you know,
there,

75
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:13.160
this is an example of advertisements that were plastered,
everybody,
you know,

76
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:16.610
telling you about how much you were going to get money after he retired.

77
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.270
Now what was the idea of the,
uh,
of social security?

78
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:23.930
The idea was that lots of people when they were young,

79
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.440
didn't really have the foresight to imagine what life was going to be like when

80
00:07:27.441 --> 00:07:30.470
they were old.
In fact,
in the late 1930s,

81
00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:33.880
the most destitute of Americans were the old and,

82
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:38.120
and so the idea was to force them to save when they were young and then the

83
00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:39.380
money would be there,

84
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.310
would be invested in US treasury bonds and accumulate interest.

85
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.480
And the money would be there when they got old.
So it was,
uh,

86
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:51.350
it was imagined to be a pre-funded system.
Pre-Funded meaning the money comes in,

87
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:53.090
uh,
and it's that money,

88
00:07:53.091 --> 00:07:56.390
which is gonna then pay people later when they get to old age.

89
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.470
And the idea was you're going to collect enough taxes so that when you got to be

90
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.070
old,
you would get 40% every year.

91
00:08:04.071 --> 00:08:08.540
You would be receiving the average person recipient retiree would be receiving

92
00:08:08.541 --> 00:08:13.310
40% of the average wage of the average young worker.
And you know,

93
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.770
ideas that when you're older,
you have less expenses,

94
00:08:15.771 --> 00:08:19.730
you probably already own your house,
your children are out of the house.
Um,

95
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.900
so 40% should be enough to keep,
uh,
you know,
to keep you going.

96
00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:26.810
And was certainly more than the average old person had at the time.

97
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.470
Now this you would get for your entire life.
So when,
when,
uh,

98
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.690
Roosevelt calvet insurance,
what was the main thing that you were insuring?
Well,

99
00:08:35.691 --> 00:08:39.590
there's a side part of the program which you mentioned,
which is ensuring people,

100
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.360
you know,
who,
uh,
have disabilities,
things like that.
But that's a,

101
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:48.290
that's a one out of the 12.4% tax.

102
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.450
It's something like 1.8%,

103
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.560
but the main part of the program is insurance against what?

104
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.940
Yes,
living too long.
So you get the money your entire life,

105
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:04.020
no matter how long you live.
So you're being insured against living too long.

106
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:08.220
Exactly.
So what happened was,
uh,

107
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:12.830
of course in the first year a lot of people were starting to pay taxes.
Uh,

108
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.290
and the second year they're paying more taxes and of course they were still not

109
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:19.890
retired yet,
so they weren't actually giving out the money to anybody in this.

110
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.900
This a fun was starting to accumulate.
So Frances Perkins said,
well,

111
00:09:24.901 --> 00:09:28.530
what are we doing here?
The whole point is that we've got all these old people,

112
00:09:28.531 --> 00:09:31.260
you know,
it's just the depression.
We haven't come out of the depression yet.

113
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:32.610
World War II hasn't started.

114
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:35.550
It won't for the U s start for a few more years by the way.

115
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.760
So there are all these old people sitting here totally destitute and uh,

116
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.510
we've got all this money also just sitting here,
it really doesn't make sense.

117
00:09:45.511 --> 00:09:46.290
She said,

118
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:50.790
what we ought to do is take the money the young people are paying in and give it

119
00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:53.500
to the old people who are already there.
Um,

120
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.240
that way we are going to be saving these old people and the young people when

121
00:09:57.241 --> 00:09:58.074
they get old,

122
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.800
there'll be saved themselves because there'll be more young people coming along

123
00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:06.090
afterwards.
You can pay taxes and when they're young and today's young,

124
00:10:06.091 --> 00:10:08.020
when they're old,
we'll then collect those taxes.

125
00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.860
And so that will be reimbursed for what they contributed when they were young.

126
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.480
Well,
so Roosevelt a resisted for a while.
She,

127
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.790
Frances Perkins was apparently incredibly persuasive person.

128
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.730
I'm one person at the time named with a,

129
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:28.350
who was on the Social Security Commission,
um,

130
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.530
tried to tell her that was going to lead to budget problems.

131
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:36.630
She said that he was a halfwit and that he,
you know,

132
00:10:36.631 --> 00:10:39.030
we had a more urgent problem,
not that she doubted him,

133
00:10:39.031 --> 00:10:40.470
but the problem was more urgent.

134
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.220
And so that was the only way to solve the problem that the current crisis,

135
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.690
so they finally agree to,
to move the system from a pre-funded system.

136
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.340
Two is pay as you go system.

137
00:10:50.341 --> 00:10:54.300
So the money coming in from current workers is used to pay directly to the old

138
00:10:54.301 --> 00:10:56.010
workers.
So then this as,

139
00:10:56.011 --> 00:11:00.390
I don't want to get into all these little variations that got made.
Okay.

140
00:11:00.391 --> 00:11:05.220
So the program's called the old age survivors and disability insurance plan.

141
00:11:05.221 --> 00:11:07.890
The insurance is mainly for living too long,

142
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.580
but also in case you get disabled or in case you,
you know,

143
00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.420
you have children and you're disabled,
you're die,
they get something.
Okay.

144
00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:17.940
So it's a combination of insurance disability,

145
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.960
but the main insurance is for living a along time.
So as I said,

146
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:27.140
the tax now is 12.4% up to a cap of $106,800 so if you make more than $106,800

147
00:11:32.761 --> 00:11:35.910
you pay,
you know,
13,000 or something.

148
00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:39.210
And then nothing more on social security.
Okay.

149
00:11:39.211 --> 00:11:44.040
So the social security tax stops at 1006000800 so you know,
the income tax,

150
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:44.720
you know,

151
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.660
I'm losing track of what it is and whether we're going to go back to the old
one,

152
00:11:48.661 --> 00:11:51.930
but let's say it was 38% 39% something like that.

153
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:57.200
If you had pay that income tax and on top of it pay social security tax of 12.4%

154
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.120
you'd be over 50% tax.
So needless to say,

155
00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:05.890
some of the people who think we can solve our social security problem by

156
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:11.130
eliminating the cap would be imposing a gigantic marginal tax rate on a,

157
00:12:11.431 --> 00:12:15.580
a lot of people who don't have a marginal tax rate.
So,
um,

158
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.480
whoever already high marginal tax rate,
that would make it sky high.

159
00:12:19.481 --> 00:12:24.250
So that's been resistance.
So 94% of workers are below the cap anyway.

160
00:12:24.251 --> 00:12:27.700
So we're talking about the top 6% most of which you'll,
you know,

161
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:32.560
you'll be in that top 6%.
So,
uh,
you won't have to pay on the margin,

162
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:36.280
a social security tax.
Now,
so there's the taxes,

163
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:40.510
12.4% and then there are the benefits.
Now,
how do the benefits work?

164
00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:43.390
How are they determined?
Well,
this,
uh,
so the,
the taxes,

165
00:12:43.391 --> 00:12:48.391
I said you just take your income below 106,000 and you pay 12.4% tax.

166
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.220
So how do the benefits work?
This is a little bit,
uh,
complicated,

167
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.650
but it's actually very interesting plan.

168
00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.640
What they do is they look at your entire lifetime earnings.

169
00:13:00.641 --> 00:13:02.620
You're not going to get benefits till after you retire.

170
00:13:02.621 --> 00:13:06.610
So you've got your whole life history behind you and they say,

171
00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.460
let's look at every year,

172
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:14.520
what the fraction of your wage was relative to the economy wide average.

173
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.260
So it's your relative earning.
So when you're young,

174
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:21.700
it's probably going to be 0.8 0.9 if you go to Yale,

175
00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:26.230
it's probably gonna be 1.5 to,
you know,
soon thereafter.

176
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:30.040
All right now.
Okay.
And it might get even higher.
But anyway,

177
00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:33.430
so that's the relative earning you have every year.
So then they say,

178
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:37.860
let's average you're 35 best relative earning years and,

179
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.780
and just divide,
you know,
take the sum divided by 35.

180
00:13:40.781 --> 00:13:45.100
So what is your average lifetime,
uh,
relative wage?
You know,

181
00:13:45.101 --> 00:13:48.460
for the average person is going to be one.
For some people it might be 0.8.

182
00:13:48.461 --> 00:13:53.220
For some people it might be two or three or 10.
Okay.
Now the first,
so,

183
00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.990
all right,
so you've got your average relative lifetime wage.

184
00:13:55.991 --> 00:13:59.200
What do you make when you retire?
Well,
when you hit an age,

185
00:13:59.201 --> 00:14:02.620
which you know they're adjusting now,
but it used to be 65

186
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:09.100
when you hit 65 they compute the average wage in the,
they compete.
Oh,

187
00:14:09.101 --> 00:14:09.910
sorry.

188
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:14.910
When you hit 65 you're going to be paid a fraction of the average wage in the

189
00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:18.220
economy when you're 65 okay.

190
00:14:18.221 --> 00:14:21.610
So what is the fraction that you're paid?
Well,

191
00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:24.880
that depends on what your historical average wage was.

192
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.970
So let's just see what the uh,
function is.

193
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.910
So if your average wage was,

194
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:35.470
was one equal to the average wage of the economy,
your entire,
you know,

195
00:14:35.471 --> 00:14:39.610
over those 35 years,
and you're the average guy venue get you see,

196
00:14:39.611 --> 00:14:40.540
that's near point.

197
00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:45.540
Ford's actually 0.44 so you get 44% of the average wage at the time you retire.

198
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.740
Okay.
If,
on the other hand,

199
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:56.770
you made a 10% of the year relative wage,

200
00:14:57.351 --> 00:15:00.230
historically it was 10% of the average wage in the economy,

201
00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:04.970
you would get 9% of the average wage at the time you retire.

202
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.810
So you can see that this is what's called the [inaudible] functions.

203
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.090
Just like our utility function is diminishing marginal returns.

204
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:16.240
So it means that if you're earning very little through your life,

205
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:20.080
you're going to get a much better deal.
You're going to be paid,
you know the,
the,

206
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:24.860
the ratio of relative wage historically to what you get of the young people's

207
00:15:24.861 --> 00:15:29.861
wage is going to be 0.9 then the slope drops to 0.32 then it drops to 0.15 and

208
00:15:31.191 --> 00:15:32.840
after your double,
it's actually,

209
00:15:32.841 --> 00:15:37.730
I think 1.99 after your double the average,

210
00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:43.250
if your historical average wage was more than twice the average wage in the

211
00:15:43.251 --> 00:15:46.790
whole economy,
it doesn't do you any good.
Might as well have been twice.

212
00:15:46.791 --> 00:15:51.440
If it's four times,
10 times,
you don't get any increase.
Okay?

213
00:15:51.441 --> 00:15:56.441
So you can see why it makes some sense to have a cap to the taxation because

214
00:15:56.901 --> 00:16:00.890
people who are making 10 times the average wage,
you know,

215
00:16:00.891 --> 00:16:04.580
but say they're average,
they're making $1 million nowadays.
You know,

216
00:16:04.581 --> 00:16:05.240
they aren't going to,

217
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.020
they aren't going to see any benefit from having contributed so much to social

218
00:16:09.021 --> 00:16:09.471
security.

219
00:16:09.471 --> 00:16:14.471
There are benefits would be just the same is if they only made $200,000 a year.

220
00:16:14.511 --> 00:16:18.860
So if you,
if you,
if you pass,
you know,
so,
okay.

221
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.280
So,
um,
anyway,

222
00:16:21.281 --> 00:16:24.130
so you see that there's a connection between how much you made when you were

223
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.600
young,
how much you get paid when you're old.

224
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.760
But the connection is a concave thing.

225
00:16:28.761 --> 00:16:33.761
So it redistributes income people who had very low average wages when they were

226
00:16:34.251 --> 00:16:38.620
working get a better deal from social security than people who had high rel

227
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:43.460
relative wage as well.
They were working.
And that's a cornerstone of the idea.

228
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:47.960
It's meant to help protect,
uh,
the people who are very poor.

229
00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:53.180
Um,
and so,
uh,
it doesn't pay everybody equally.
It's still,
you get,

230
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:56.780
you know,
you get,
uh,
some return from having contributed more,

231
00:16:56.781 --> 00:17:00.350
but definitely you don't get a completely fair return because the whole idea is

232
00:17:00.351 --> 00:17:03.590
to redistribute wealth and help the law the least well off.
Okay.

233
00:17:03.591 --> 00:17:07.970
So that's one of the cornerstones of social security.
All right,
so,

234
00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:13.100
um,
going back now,
what happens to you after the first year?

235
00:17:13.101 --> 00:17:17.630
Retire?
You retire after the first year retire.
So when you're 65,

236
00:17:17.631 --> 00:17:20.270
you're getting 40% of the average wage.

237
00:17:20.271 --> 00:17:23.480
If you're the average worker throughout your life,
you know,
it was 44%,

238
00:17:23.481 --> 00:17:26.620
something like that.
After that,
your way,

239
00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.110
you're a social security benefit is indexed to inflation.

240
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.570
So it grows at the rate of inflation.

241
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:35.150
The wage is probably growing faster than the rate of inflation.

242
00:17:35.151 --> 00:17:40.070
So as you get to be 75,
80 and 85,
your average,
uh,
benefit,

243
00:17:40.071 --> 00:17:41.850
your benefit is,
you know,

244
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:47.020
down to 36% of the average wage of the workers when you're 85,

245
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:52.240
but it starts off 44%.
Assuming you were average,
do your whole life,
uh,

246
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:57.270
there'll be 44% and gradually decline.
If wages grow faster than uh,
prices.

247
00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:57.811
Okay.

248
00:17:57.811 --> 00:18:02.811
So it's insuring you against living long because the benefit carries on forever.

249
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.230
It's insuring you against inflation because it's inflation corrected.

250
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:11.820
It's in a way insuring you against,
uh,
you know,

251
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.000
feeling like a loser because you're always going to get a,
you know,
uh,

252
00:18:15.001 --> 00:18:19.320
start off with a fraction of the new average wage.
So if your children,
you know,

253
00:18:19.321 --> 00:18:23.250
if the whole country grows incredibly fast and your children are incredibly,

254
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:27.240
incredibly wealthy and getting high average wages and every,
you know,

255
00:18:27.241 --> 00:18:30.600
every young person is making a lot,
the old won't feel totally left out.

256
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.890
There'll be,
you know,
keeping up with them,
40% of them anyway.
And similarly,

257
00:18:34.891 --> 00:18:38.850
if the young have a horrible time and aren't making very much money,

258
00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:43.500
the benefits to the old also go way down because they're getting 44% of a much

259
00:18:43.501 --> 00:18:48.120
lower number.
So it's every generation in it together.
Um,

260
00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:52.830
and redistributing wealth from the Witcher to the less rich protecting you

261
00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:55.980
against long life.
Uh,
making sure that you have some money,

262
00:18:55.981 --> 00:18:58.130
no matter how long you live.
Um,

263
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:01.200
that's the idea of the system.

264
00:19:01.201 --> 00:19:03.690
Is there any questions about how this mechanically works?

265
00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.593
Okay?

266
00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.073
<v 2>Okay.</v>

267
00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:20.870
<v 0>Okay.
Now it's very hard to do this and the market,
by the way,
if you wanted to,</v>

268
00:19:20.871 --> 00:19:24.830
if you,
for example,
now,
so think to yourself,
oh,

269
00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:28.730
I'd like to protect myself against my old age and you know,

270
00:19:28.731 --> 00:19:32.960
I'm three years out of Yale and I fallen into an incredible job that's paying me

271
00:19:32.961 --> 00:19:34.640
a huge fortune.
And you know,

272
00:19:34.641 --> 00:19:37.970
I might want to retire early and you don't be a writer of the rest of my life.

273
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:39.080
And,
uh,

274
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:45.370
you can't easily find an annuity in the private market that's going to tell you

275
00:19:46.851 --> 00:19:48.530
that,
you know,
when you hit 65,

276
00:19:48.531 --> 00:19:51.800
it'll continue paying you for the rest of your life.
You can actually find them,

277
00:19:51.801 --> 00:19:54.260
but they're incredibly bad deals.
Okay.

278
00:19:54.261 --> 00:19:59.210
And the reason that they're bad deals is that,
um,
the people,

279
00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:03.920
uh,
who would have to take the money now and give it back to you when you're old,

280
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:05.130
uh,
first of all,
you,
you,

281
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.940
you have to worry whether they're going to be around and still be able to pay

282
00:20:07.941 --> 00:20:11.150
you when you get old.
And secondly,
they're worried that,
you know,

283
00:20:11.151 --> 00:20:15.740
the only people who come to them are people whose families live,
uh,
you know,

284
00:20:15.741 --> 00:20:16.670
a hundred years.

285
00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.520
And so they're going to have to pay a lot longer than they would for the average

286
00:20:19.521 --> 00:20:19.941
person.

287
00:20:19.941 --> 00:20:23.420
So there were afraid of getting a bad selection that is a selection of super

288
00:20:23.421 --> 00:20:25.850
healthy people wanting to make that deal.

289
00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:28.880
And so they basically assume you're going to live to a hundred.

290
00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.910
And so they're giving you a very low annuity year by year.

291
00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:37.090
So social security is doing something that is very hard to obtain in the market.

292
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.680
Okay.
Now,
um,

293
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:46.930
so what went wrong?
Oh,
I should say a couple of other things about it.

294
00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:51.610
So some other interesting things.
You can choose to retire early if you want.

295
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.750
So if you retire before 65 and you want to get your payments starting earlier,

296
00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:57.520
they say,
okay,
you can do that,

297
00:20:57.521 --> 00:21:00.400
but we're going to cut the payments every year and they make some actuarial

298
00:21:00.401 --> 00:21:04.090
calculation so that it's fair.
You know,
based on how the long,

299
00:21:04.091 --> 00:21:07.600
the average person lives,
if you start at 63,
you get two extra years.

300
00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.090
But they know if you live the average amount of time,

301
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.420
you know how much to cut it down so that on average you'll get the same amount

302
00:21:13.421 --> 00:21:15.910
as if you did the normal thing.
Retiring at 65,

303
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:19.840
they've actually raised this age to 67.
Okay.
Now,

304
00:21:19.841 --> 00:21:24.730
another thing is the,
uh,
spousal benefit.
This is actually quite amusing,

305
00:21:24.731 --> 00:21:29.330
I think.
So I had a secretary 20 years ago who,
um,

306
00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:34.240
got married three times.
And so sh she consulted me about this.

307
00:21:34.241 --> 00:21:36.940
So if you're a spouse,
uh,
you know,

308
00:21:36.941 --> 00:21:40.810
traditionally one of the spouses wouldn't work,
typically the woman.

309
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.690
And so the,
the wife would,

310
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:48.840
has the right to 50% of her husbands where the husband has a white,
you know,

311
00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:53.940
one spouse has a right to 50% of the benefits of the other spouse just by virtue

312
00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.410
of being married or having been married.

313
00:21:56.710 --> 00:22:00.310
So the rule is that if you've been married for more than 10 years,

314
00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:04.030
then you can either take your own social security benefits or if they're bigger,

315
00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:05.980
you can take 50% of your spouses.

316
00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:10.690
And if you've been married to several different guys and say,
and you're,

317
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.740
you're,
you're not married to any of them anymore,

318
00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:17.750
you can pick the guy who had the highest income and get 50%.
So she had to,

319
00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.480
she tracked down,

320
00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.920
she tracked down her first husband she hadn't talked to in 30 years and he,

321
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:28.810
anyway,
so,
oh,
okay.

322
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:32.440
So,
and there are a bunch of other rules.
But anyway,
that's not really the,
the,
uh,

323
00:22:32.441 --> 00:22:36.280
the heart of the matter of the heart of the matter is.
Okay,

324
00:22:36.281 --> 00:22:40.630
so let's just give you an idea of the size.
This was in 2005.
Okay.
So,
you know,

325
00:22:40.631 --> 00:22:43.780
157 million workers are paying into it.

326
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:48.490
There were 48 million beneficiaries.
And uh,
okay.
So,
you know,
it's a,

327
00:22:48.491 --> 00:22:49.870
it's a gigantic program.

328
00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:54.730
So imagine the cost of keeping track of just who's alive.

329
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:58.480
You know how when somebody dies they're supposed to stop collecting social

330
00:22:58.481 --> 00:23:01.000
security.
How do they know that the guys died?
I mean,

331
00:23:01.001 --> 00:23:03.610
that by itself is not an easy thing to keep track of.

332
00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:06.220
They have to send the checks to everybody.
Somebody moves,

333
00:23:06.221 --> 00:23:09.970
they have to figure out where to send the check to the new address.
They have to,

334
00:23:09.971 --> 00:23:13.660
uh,
get the taxes.
They have to make sure people are paying the right amount.

335
00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.380
It's a Ma,
it's a,
it's a huge thing involving,
you know,

336
00:23:17.381 --> 00:23:19.090
basically the entire population.

337
00:23:19.091 --> 00:23:22.720
You order a couple hundred million people almost either getting taxes,

338
00:23:22.721 --> 00:23:26.860
paying taxes or receiving benefits,
you know,
over 200 million people.

339
00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:31.300
It's an incredible amount of paperwork and moving stuff around and figuring

340
00:23:31.301 --> 00:23:35.800
stuff out.
And so how,
uh,
much as it cost,

341
00:23:35.801 --> 00:23:40.510
how much money do they waste running the whole thing.
Less than 1% of the,

342
00:23:40.511 --> 00:23:45.100
of the benefits.
Okay.
So it's one of the most efficiently run,

343
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:47.120
uh,
programs,

344
00:23:47.121 --> 00:23:52.121
maybe the most efficiently run program government has ever devised.

345
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.200
So it isn't that the thing is going broke as you might believe,

346
00:23:57.201 --> 00:24:01.400
listening to George Bush because somehow they're pissing away the money and just

347
00:24:01.401 --> 00:24:02.870
losing it.
It's,

348
00:24:02.871 --> 00:24:06.230
that's not the reason something else was happening because they don't waste much

349
00:24:06.231 --> 00:24:09.530
money,
uh,
running the program.
Okay.

350
00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:11.720
So this just gives you an idea just to the size of it.

351
00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.120
So this is 2005 do you have to add,
you know,

352
00:24:14.121 --> 00:24:18.020
20% or something or 15%.
So the benefits,

353
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.260
the contributions,
593 billion.

354
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.860
Remember this is there's a tax rule of 12.4%.

355
00:24:24.861 --> 00:24:26.180
Then you have to pay out the benefits,

356
00:24:26.181 --> 00:24:28.820
which is some other rule depending on what you earned in the past.

357
00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.220
So there's no connection between the two.

358
00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.120
And in fact the contributions are bigger than the benefits.

359
00:24:34.121 --> 00:24:37.640
So the put via trust fund was growing and you know,

360
00:24:37.641 --> 00:24:42.080
look at the administrative expenses.
Tiny.
And there are some,
you know,

361
00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:46.160
the railroad,
when the law was first passed,
railroads were in trouble.
And so,

362
00:24:46.161 --> 00:24:48.200
you know,
in order to get some senator to vote for it,

363
00:24:48.201 --> 00:24:50.120
they had to hand money over to the railroad.
So anyway,

364
00:24:50.121 --> 00:24:54.170
something's going on with the railroads.
But the other,
the other,

365
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.410
the other benefit is,
uh,
the trust fund,
you know,

366
00:24:57.411 --> 00:25:00.080
makes returns because it's a $2 trillion trust fund.

367
00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:02.870
It was a little smaller than 2005.
So it's earning interest.

368
00:25:02.871 --> 00:25:06.950
That's part of the extra returns.
You see why the s the surplus is quite big now,

369
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:11.750
but it's headed to be quite small.
Okay,

370
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:16.870
so now what is the argument about what is the crisis of social security?

371
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:20.870
Uh,
what are the Democrats and the Republicans say,
well,

372
00:25:20.871 --> 00:25:22.700
you've just heard what the program is,
you know,

373
00:25:22.701 --> 00:25:26.270
how attractive do you think it is if you really think it's such a good program?

374
00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:31.310
So the main thing is it's going broke.
Okay,
so now why is it going,

375
00:25:31.311 --> 00:25:34.730
bro?
It's not broke now.
It's making more money than it's paying out.

376
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:37.520
But in the future it's very obvious that,
you know,

377
00:25:37.521 --> 00:25:42.290
you can just look at the demography.
It's very obvious that it's going to the,

378
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.690
the,
the benefit formula is going to be,

379
00:25:44.691 --> 00:25:47.870
is so big and they're going to be so many people retired that the payments you

380
00:25:47.871 --> 00:25:50.840
make to the old when I,
when I'm retired,

381
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:54.080
are going to be way bigger than the payments that the young are making in taxes.

382
00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.770
Provided the rules stay the same.
So that's the main problem.

383
00:25:57.771 --> 00:26:01.900
Somehow the system got out of whack and we have to figure out,
uh,

384
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.190
how to put it back together.

385
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:08.020
Now it's no surprise in one sense that there's an imbalance because there was

386
00:26:08.021 --> 00:26:12.350
nothing about the rules that balanced it.
I mean,
the taxes you pay,

387
00:26:12.351 --> 00:26:16.310
we'll look at this a second,
you know,
that's just some formula 12.4%.

388
00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:21.200
What's that got to do with the benefits you're paying?
Well,
the benefits are,

389
00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.190
you know,
40% on average of what new young people are making.

390
00:26:25.191 --> 00:26:30.140
So basically somehow the system must have assumed that there'd be three young

391
00:26:30.141 --> 00:26:34.370
people for every old person.
So the young people paying 12% each,

392
00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:36.920
the old guy getting 40% you know,

393
00:26:36.921 --> 00:26:40.790
three times 12 is 12.4 it's close to 40%.

394
00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.290
So you know,
if the,

395
00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.650
if the ratio of young to old young workers to old retirees getting benefits is

396
00:26:46.651 --> 00:26:49.140
three to one,
then the systems go to sort of be in balance.

397
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:53.250
But if that ratio is very different from that,
the system,
for example,

398
00:26:53.251 --> 00:26:55.110
to young people,
for every old person,

399
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.060
the system is going to be way out of balance.

400
00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.780
And the formula has nothing to do with how many children people are having or

401
00:27:00.781 --> 00:27:05.450
anything like that.
So it's not so surprising.
It's gotten out of balance.
Um,

402
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.060
but we're gonna see there's a much more fundamental reason why it's out of

403
00:27:09.061 --> 00:27:11.730
balance.
Okay.
So the first problem is,
it's not in balance,

404
00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:16.500
but there are many other problems.
So why do Democrats like it so much?

405
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:20.690
Democrats say,
Oh,
it's wonderful.
You know,
we're helping poor people.

406
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.030
We're redistributing things on the basis of lifetime earnings.

407
00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:28.050
We're sharing risks between generations.
We're all in this together.
As I said,

408
00:27:28.051 --> 00:27:32.130
if the young people have bad wages than the old,
get less benefits.

409
00:27:32.131 --> 00:27:35.250
If the young are booming along making huge wages than the,

410
00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:39.810
than the old guys keep up with them.
And uh,
and you know,
so there's less,

411
00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.970
you know,
so it's not only insurance,

412
00:27:41.971 --> 00:27:45.690
but it's kind of less jealousy and less disparity in the population.

413
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.810
And then you're protected against long life.

414
00:27:48.811 --> 00:27:53.811
You're protected against inflation and you can't blunder away your money because

415
00:27:55.021 --> 00:27:57.420
you have no choice about where your investment goes.

416
00:27:57.421 --> 00:27:59.880
The government's taken care of it.
So if you're a bad investor,

417
00:27:59.881 --> 00:28:02.130
you can't suddenly find that you've lost all your money.

418
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:07.050
So now what a Republican's say,
Republicans.
Uh,

419
00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:11.870
um,
and,
and surprisingly I'm going to,
well,

420
00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:15.180
you'll be surprised where I come out on this.
I think so the Republicans say,

421
00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:20.460
you know,
this stuff is much less good than it sounds at first glance.

422
00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.000
Uh,
for one thing,
there are no property rights.
I mean,

423
00:28:24.001 --> 00:28:26.610
who's to say what I'm going to get when I'm old?
I mean,

424
00:28:26.611 --> 00:28:28.710
nobody even knows what they're going to get when they're old.

425
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.670
I defy you are a Republican would say to tell me exactly what your benefits are

426
00:28:32.671 --> 00:28:35.820
going to be or even to explain to me how they're calculated.

427
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:40.230
Virtually nobody in the population can do that.
That's just not right.
That uh,

428
00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:43.420
and you have no control of them.
So what's going to happen to republic would,

429
00:28:43.421 --> 00:28:45.810
would say,
one of these days the Democrats are going to say,

430
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.230
all the system's broke.
We can't afford to pay everything,

431
00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.290
so we're going to cut all the benefits in half or something.

432
00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.970
So Republican would say,
you know,

433
00:28:53.971 --> 00:28:58.110
they're not even my benefits I want in order for me to really feel good about

434
00:28:58.111 --> 00:29:01.740
participating in social security,
I want to know that when I put the money in,

435
00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.800
what I'm getting out and I want to own it.

436
00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:08.490
I don't want it to be some vague promise that can be taken away from me and

437
00:29:08.491 --> 00:29:10.980
probably will be taken away from me.
Okay.

438
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:14.910
So it's a matter of property rights and transparency.
Uh,

439
00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.080
then another thing is,

440
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:21.110
even if you did know this formula that I just explained,

441
00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:25.500
you know,
people who want to retire and want to figure out how to plan for their

442
00:29:25.501 --> 00:29:28.290
retirement.
What does a normal person do?
He says,

443
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.380
how much money have I got in the bank?
You know,
I've saved on my work.

444
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.480
I've got $100,000 in the bank.

445
00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:37.800
Please tell me what the value today is of my future social security benefits.

446
00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:42.100
If those are,
you know,
$8 million,

447
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:43.780
then I know that my hundred thousand dollars,

448
00:29:43.781 --> 00:29:47.530
I don't want to waste too much time trying to accumulate money out of my savings

449
00:29:47.531 --> 00:29:48.101
because you know,

450
00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:52.810
I'll never catch up date million dollars if it's $50,000 is today's market value

451
00:29:52.811 --> 00:29:54.670
of my future social security benefits.

452
00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:58.120
I know that I better be putting in a lot of money today.
So,

453
00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:00.460
and I know you know how much of my,

454
00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.600
how much money today is how big by savings or a relative to what the market

455
00:30:04.601 --> 00:30:07.960
value is of my social security benefits.
So the Republicans say,
you know,

456
00:30:07.961 --> 00:30:10.720
people just don't have any idea what the value of their benefits are.

457
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:13.270
Even if they happen to know the formula,
I just explain.

458
00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:18.850
Nobody really can calculate what it is.
Okay.
Then,
uh,
thirdly,

459
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.010
you know,
the rich are giving money to the poor.

460
00:30:21.011 --> 00:30:24.910
Everybody knows social security's doing that.
Can you tell me how much,
you know,

461
00:30:24.911 --> 00:30:27.160
what,
what's the effective tax rate?

462
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:31.270
Let's say I'm at the top tax break prachat what is my effective tax rate on

463
00:30:31.271 --> 00:30:32.470
social security?
I mean,

464
00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:37.300
what fraction of my taxes are being taken away from me?
You know,

465
00:30:37.301 --> 00:30:40.480
because my benefits are going to be less good because I was one of the highest

466
00:30:40.481 --> 00:30:43.600
earners who can,
you know,
there's virtually no one in the country.

467
00:30:43.601 --> 00:30:46.210
He was able to answer that question and Republican would say,

468
00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.870
what kind of a program is this?
If nobody knows,
you know?
Okay.
They'll say,

469
00:30:49.871 --> 00:30:50.141
you know,

470
00:30:50.141 --> 00:30:53.440
we may sign on to the idea that the rich and give some of their money to the

471
00:30:53.441 --> 00:30:56.380
poor,
but at least tell us how much of our money we're giving to the poor.

472
00:30:56.530 --> 00:31:01.420
We don't even know.
Okay.
And then the Republicans say,
we'd like,
um,

473
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:05.260
equity like returns,
you know,
why is it,
this is what George Bush said,

474
00:31:05.261 --> 00:31:07.480
why is it that our returns are going to be 2%?

475
00:31:07.481 --> 00:31:11.440
I'd like to know that my money is being invested in the stock market and earning

476
00:31:11.441 --> 00:31:14.950
a really,
you know,
what I could get in the stock market.
I mean,
I'm,
you know,

477
00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:19.060
I'm a row anyway.
Oh,
republicans or you know,
everybody,
you know,

478
00:31:19.061 --> 00:31:22.240
there's the savvy investors like to think that the money that they're being

479
00:31:22.241 --> 00:31:26.400
forced to save can get the same rate of return as they get in the,
uh,

480
00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:29.230
they could get for themselves.
Why should they be cheated in a government?

481
00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:31.180
Nevermind that they have to give away part of the money,

482
00:31:31.181 --> 00:31:34.120
the part that they're not giving away at least audit or an equity returns.

483
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:39.070
And then there's the,
uh,
Republican's tend to think that choice is a good thing,

484
00:31:39.071 --> 00:31:43.240
not a bad thing.
And so if you let people decide how to invest it,
be better,

485
00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:47.000
uh,
you know,
it'd be better for them than if you,
uh,

486
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:50.500
even if some of the people make mistakes.
Okay.
So those are the two,

487
00:31:50.501 --> 00:31:53.530
those are maybe some of you can add some other criticisms.
Yeah.

488
00:31:58.960 --> 00:31:59.793
<v 1>Yup.</v>

489
00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:08.900
Unable to calculate the present value
precisely.

490
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:13.750
Any system that successfully

491
00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:17.470
supposed to perform.

492
00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:25.690
<v 0>Yeah.
So no,
I don't think so because,
um,</v>

493
00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.170
so his question is,
since we don't know how long we're going to live,

494
00:32:29.171 --> 00:32:33.700
how can you pro and the program continues to insure you for your entire life and

495
00:32:33.701 --> 00:32:34.900
pay you for your entire life?

496
00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:39.350
How can you figure out what the market value of that is?
Well,

497
00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:43.160
the fact is there is no general market.
You can look.
So you're right,

498
00:32:43.161 --> 00:32:47.720
there is no general market you can look at now today that will tell you,

499
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.330
suppose we pay,
you know,

500
00:32:50.331 --> 00:32:53.420
a fixed amount of money for the average person in the economy.

501
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:56.060
What's the present value of that?
However,

502
00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:00.530
that doesn't mean we couldn't have a market like that.
And so I,

503
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:05.060
my solution is going to involve precisely at market like that.
So,

504
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:09.470
uh,
it could be,
you could,
so to answer his question,

505
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:14.120
it's not inherently impossible to attach a market price to paying somebody for

506
00:33:14.121 --> 00:33:16.160
the rest of his life.
After all,

507
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:20.300
you could imagine social security now paying,
you know,

508
00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.540
let's say 50 million people,
the people are now retired.

509
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:26.600
Each of them is going to be paid for the rest of his life according to a rule

510
00:33:26.601 --> 00:33:30.560
which we all understand,
you know,
just goes up with inflation.
So you could say,

511
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:34.760
suppose you own 1% of all those payments,

512
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:38.090
what would the value of that be?
You could trade a security like that.

513
00:33:38.091 --> 00:33:38.901
Somebody could say,

514
00:33:38.901 --> 00:33:43.330
I want to buy today a security that gives me 1% of all the payments everybody's

515
00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:44.000
going to get.

516
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.710
Or it could be 1% of all the payments every 70 year old today is going to get

517
00:33:48.711 --> 00:33:51.080
from social security.
That's a well defined thing.

518
00:33:51.081 --> 00:33:53.630
And it could trade in the market.
You're going to see that the market,

519
00:33:53.631 --> 00:33:54.950
as soon as we start talking about this,

520
00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:58.370
there are incredible number of derivative instruments.

521
00:33:58.371 --> 00:33:59.990
They're called that trade in the market.

522
00:33:59.991 --> 00:34:03.410
That could be a new one and then there would it be a market price.

523
00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:07.670
So you're going,
so you're,
you're going to see when I propose my plan,

524
00:34:07.671 --> 00:34:10.040
what that involves,
something like that.

525
00:34:10.041 --> 00:34:13.790
Any other questions about the rules of social security or whether you think

526
00:34:13.791 --> 00:34:15.830
they're bad or good for some other reason?

527
00:34:15.831 --> 00:34:19.100
I've tried to list the ones that struck me as the most important.
Yeah.

528
00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:21.350
<v 1>What does it mean by a return?</v>

529
00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.180
<v 0>Equity like returns?
Is this what you're referring to?</v>

530
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:35.180
<v 1>You mean define the return?
Is it
Texas?</v>

531
00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:41.300
<v 0>Okay.
So if you,
uh,
you can always do this calculation,</v>

532
00:34:41.301 --> 00:34:44.030
which I'm going to w which has historically been done.

533
00:34:44.031 --> 00:34:45.710
I'm going to show you those numbers in a second.

534
00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:49.970
You can always look at how many tags.
Let's take some,
let's take,
you know,

535
00:34:49.971 --> 00:34:52.490
someone my father's age,
my father actually died,
but you know,

536
00:34:52.491 --> 00:34:53.780
a couple of years ago,
my father,

537
00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.710
he could look back at his whole life and he could look at how much money he paid

538
00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:00.590
in social security taxes,
this when he was young,

539
00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:04.610
and then he could look at what benefits he got every year until that point.

540
00:35:04.611 --> 00:35:06.230
And let's say it was day after he died,

541
00:35:06.231 --> 00:35:09.830
I could look at what he got every year until he died.
So then I could just,

542
00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:12.590
you know,
that's just a sequence of cash flows.

543
00:35:12.591 --> 00:35:16.010
We know how to calculate the internal rate of return of that sequence.

544
00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.410
That's his rate of return.
Okay.

545
00:35:18.411 --> 00:35:22.070
And I showed you and the graph long time ago that that was actually done

546
00:35:22.071 --> 00:35:26.330
historic.
We've done that.
Lymer did that.
Uh,

547
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:31.460
here,
he did that for every generation,
every birth cohort,
the average person,

548
00:35:31.461 --> 00:35:32.540
what their return was.

549
00:35:32.541 --> 00:35:36.170
And you see it was very high to begin with and I become pitiful.
And if you look,

550
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:39.270
if you know,
forecast the future for you,

551
00:35:39.271 --> 00:35:42.210
it's going to be less than 2% so bushes saying,

552
00:35:42.211 --> 00:35:44.400
why should you young Yale undergraduate,

553
00:35:44.401 --> 00:35:48.690
why should you be satisfied with less than 2% if instead of paying those taxes

554
00:35:48.691 --> 00:35:51.090
to social security,
you put them in the stock market,

555
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:54.450
you'd get lots more than 2% probably.
So why,

556
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.620
why be satisfied with 2% okay.
In Gore would say,
well,

557
00:35:58.621 --> 00:36:00.390
now that we've got this pay as you go system,

558
00:36:00.391 --> 00:36:03.300
you can't possibly put it in the stock market because then the old people aren't

559
00:36:03.301 --> 00:36:04.134
going to get it.

560
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.370
So.
Okay.
Any other questions?

561
00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:16.560
Any other reasons you think the program is good or bad?
Social Security.

562
00:36:16.561 --> 00:36:17.820
Should we get rid of,
you know,

563
00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:20.610
what's your feeling about whether we should get rid of it or not?

564
00:36:20.611 --> 00:36:22.530
Or privatized it or change it?

565
00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:25.933
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

566
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:30.180
it discriminates against people who are predisposed

567
00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:38.050
favor is a couple of that food ages far apart?

568
00:36:38.051 --> 00:36:39.010
If they're screaming,

569
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:42.210
<v 0>yes.
Okay.</v>

570
00:36:42.211 --> 00:36:47.070
So he's saying other problems with social security is that it discriminates,

571
00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:50.480
uh,
it doesn't treat everybody equally.
So who are the molding?

572
00:36:50.481 --> 00:36:55.110
So for his first example is people who you can reasonably expect to die sooner

573
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:57.290
are going to get a less good deal than purple.

574
00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:59.100
You can reasonably expect to live longer.

575
00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:03.840
So what is the most basic class that being discriminated against?

576
00:37:03.841 --> 00:37:04.674
Therefore,

577
00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:12.610
who among you can you predict is going to,

578
00:37:12.611 --> 00:37:16.270
are going to live less long than others among you?
At least historically.

579
00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:22.300
There's only that will stay true.
Yup.
Men.
Okay.

580
00:37:22.301 --> 00:37:26.830
So men live six years less long than women.
So men are getting a bad deal.
Now.

581
00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:31.930
Um,
black men historically,
although this is rapidly changing,

582
00:37:31.931 --> 00:37:34.480
but black men lived even last long,
then,
you know,

583
00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:36.280
even worse by a considerable degree.

584
00:37:36.281 --> 00:37:40.480
So you'd think it discriminated against black men.
Um,

585
00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:45.940
so,
uh,
black men also tended to be poorer on average though.

586
00:37:45.941 --> 00:37:50.230
So they were getting a better return per year then rich white men.
But anyway,

587
00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.220
that's a black man with the same earnings,

588
00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:57.880
got a much worse deal historically on social security than a white man with the

589
00:37:57.881 --> 00:38:02.080
same earnings because on average the black man died before the white man.
Um,

590
00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:05.770
that may,
you know,
that probably had a lot to do with,
uh,
you know,

591
00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.340
health care and nutrition and stuff like that.
And this is rapidly changing.

592
00:38:09.341 --> 00:38:12.880
But anyway,
certainly it seems like men are going to get a worse deal than women.

593
00:38:12.881 --> 00:38:16.180
So yeah,
there are all kinds of little problems with social security like that.

594
00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:21.400
Um,
anything out.
So he mentioned a couple others too.
So any other,

595
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:25.810
uh,
I regard those as less critical though then,
then,

596
00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:29.260
then the problem thing going broke and these things which have split the
country,

597
00:38:29.261 --> 00:38:30.430
it's been impossible.

598
00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:33.400
So basically everybody thinks this is a logical contradiction.

599
00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:37.660
You can't do what the Republicans the same time do what the Democrats want.

600
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:39.670
So what should you do?

601
00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:42.720
<v 1>Okay.</v>

602
00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.990
<v 0>Anything else?
Anyone wants to say?
Someone else had their hand up before.</v>

603
00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:52.460
All right,
so why did the system becomes such a mess?

604
00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:56.150
How did it go broke?
How should we have expected it to go broke?

605
00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:59.900
So did it all happen because there was the baby boom.

606
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:06.180
All right.
So I want to tell a little parable.

607
00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:09.660
So that has nothing to do with the baby.
Boom.

608
00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:11.120
<v 1>Okay?</v>

609
00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:14.760
<v 0>Okay.
So imagine that.
Uh,
and I'm,</v>

610
00:39:14.761 --> 00:39:16.610
I'm saying it in terms of fathers and sons,

611
00:39:16.611 --> 00:39:18.380
but I couldn't say mothers and daughters.
Okay.

612
00:39:18.381 --> 00:39:22.460
So historically it was men working most of the time.
But let's,
let's do,

613
00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:26.900
let's do mothers and daughters.
Okay.
So suppose a mother,
um,

614
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.290
is old now and sick and she has,

615
00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:34.760
she needs an incredibly expensive operation,
$1 million to,
uh,

616
00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:38.360
you know,
to save her or,
you know,
to extend her life.

617
00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:42.710
So she doesn't have the money.
So she goes to her daughter and she says,
you know,

618
00:39:42.711 --> 00:39:44.420
I want,
I need $1 million.

619
00:39:44.421 --> 00:39:47.780
And of course the daughter who loves her wants to come up with $1 million to pay

620
00:39:47.781 --> 00:39:52.490
for her.
But you know,
that's a lot for her to pay.
So she thinks to herself,

621
00:39:52.491 --> 00:39:56.360
you know,
my mother not only gave me life,
but let's face it,
without her,

622
00:39:56.660 --> 00:40:00.260
my daughter wouldn't have any life and her daughter wouldn't have any life and

623
00:40:00.261 --> 00:40:02.030
her granddaughter wouldn't have any life.

624
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:04.400
And you don't mind mother's responsible for not just me,

625
00:40:04.401 --> 00:40:06.200
but all these generations after me.

626
00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:11.440
Why should I be the one to pay the entire benefit of my mother's operation?

627
00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:15.470
So you know what I'm going to do?
I'll give her the million dollars,

628
00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:20.030
but when I get old,
I'm going to go to my daughter and say,
daughter of mine,

629
00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:23.210
I sacrificed for your grandmother.
My mother.

630
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:26.900
I put up $1 million to safer.
I'm broke now.
You know,

631
00:40:26.901 --> 00:40:28.280
maybe I don't need an operation,

632
00:40:28.281 --> 00:40:32.840
but I'm basically totally broke because I spent so much money rescuing my

633
00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.250
mother.
You know,

634
00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:38.870
why don't you do the same for me that I did for my mother and give me $1
million.

635
00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:42.560
And by the way,
you know,
you can use the same argument with your daughter.

636
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:45.650
And so it's really not so bad because you're going to get the money back when

637
00:40:45.651 --> 00:40:48.800
you're old.
And so the granddaughter agree,
you know,

638
00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:52.040
the granddaughter agrees and pays the daughter and then when she gets old she

639
00:40:52.041 --> 00:40:55.850
does the same thing.
It goes on for generation after generation.

640
00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:00.350
Now let's say it went on forever.
How,
how did this happen?

641
00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:05.010
Have we just,
I mean,
did the money get,
did nobody loses anything and we gave the,

642
00:41:05.011 --> 00:41:06.920
we paid for the operation to begin with.

643
00:41:06.921 --> 00:41:11.330
Is this some kind of Ponzi scheme or something or how,
who pay,
you know,

644
00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.630
where did the million dollar operation get financed?
How did that happen?

645
00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:18.650
Can you who paid for it?

646
00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:23.363
<v 1>Yup.</v>

647
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:37.700
<v 0>Well you got $1 million back,
remember when you were old.</v>

648
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:43.010
Okay.
Exactly.
So that's the whole point.

649
00:41:43.011 --> 00:41:46.190
The point is that the daughter made the dollar paid.

650
00:41:46.191 --> 00:41:49.480
So just to repeat what he said,
the dollar in case you couldn't hear it,

651
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:53.570
the dollar,
the first daughter paid $1 million when she was young.
Yes,

652
00:41:53.571 --> 00:41:55.760
she got the million dollars back.
But when she was old,

653
00:41:55.761 --> 00:42:00.560
and that's a long time later.
So for that whole time she made a 0% interest.

654
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:05.120
Now maybe the interest rate was let's say over that many years,
you know,

655
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:09.800
uh,
you know,
we're talking about 30 years or something,
some Laurent or 40 years,

656
00:42:09.801 --> 00:42:13.900
a large amount of time.
So the interest rate could easily over the,
you know,

657
00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:17.480
if 40 years you divide 40 and to the 72 you know,

658
00:42:17.481 --> 00:42:18.950
it's like one in three quarters or something.

659
00:42:18.951 --> 00:42:22.640
So if the real interest rate was one in three quarters,
something like that,

660
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:27.110
you could easily imagine that the,
that was the doubling rule that,
you know,

661
00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:32.111
$100 could have been turned into 200 so the first daughter who took her hundred

662
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:37.400
dollars could have had 200 by the time she was old,
she only got 101 she was old.

663
00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:41.210
So in present value terms,
she gave up a hundred when she was young.

664
00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:44.780
She got in present value terms,
$50 when she was old.

665
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:48.650
So she gave away $50 she paid for half the population,

666
00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.350
half the operation.

667
00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:54.230
Now where did the rest of the $50 come from?
Well,

668
00:42:54.231 --> 00:42:57.140
the granddaughter gave a hundred when she was young,

669
00:42:57.141 --> 00:43:00.140
got a hundred when she was old.
So in present value terms,

670
00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:04.340
she also lost $50 exactly the same amount as the first daughter.

671
00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:07.550
She gave up the same thing.
Her contribution was just as big.

672
00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:11.510
Of course it came a lot later.
So in present value terms,

673
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:13.610
at the time of the operation,

674
00:43:13.611 --> 00:43:18.050
the granddaughter's contribution is discounted twice.
So it's a half of a half.

675
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:22.550
So she only contributed in present value terms,
$25 to the,

676
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:26.840
to the operation.
And then the,
the great granddaughter,
you know,
she,

677
00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.810
she herself looks at it as a $50 contribution.

678
00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.000
But from the point of view of the original operation,

679
00:43:32.001 --> 00:43:35.240
it's discounted three times.
So by eight,
so it's 12 and a half.

680
00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:39.140
So 50 plus 25 was 12 and a half,
plus six and a quarter,
blah,
blah,
blah.

681
00:43:39.141 --> 00:43:41.000
Forever adds up to the hundred.

682
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:46.210
So basically this parable shows how a daughter could share the cost of,

683
00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:50.540
uh,
her mother's operation.
Uh,

684
00:43:50.541 --> 00:43:55.541
among all the descendants pay completely for the operation with each generation

685
00:43:55.551 --> 00:43:58.850
making the same contribution,
the same sacrifice.
Of course,

686
00:43:58.851 --> 00:44:02.450
the generations who make it earlier are helping the mother more.

687
00:44:02.451 --> 00:44:06.980
But the point is every generation has made exactly the same sacrifice and paid

688
00:44:06.981 --> 00:44:10.820
for.
And that's how the mothers,
the original mother's operation got paid for.

689
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:15.000
Okay.
Now what happens in generation 10,
the great Greg regular,

690
00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.420
very weak brand daughter is going to say,
you know,

691
00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:20.180
I never even heard of this original mother.

692
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.670
I couldn't care less about her operation.

693
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:26.300
It wasn't a very good operation anyway cause she died three years later because

694
00:44:26.301 --> 00:44:28.880
medicine was so bad at the time.
So,
you know,

695
00:44:28.881 --> 00:44:33.810
why should I be paying my contribution to that original mother's operation?
Yes,

696
00:44:33.811 --> 00:44:36.120
I know that she's responsible for my life,
but you know,
I,

697
00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:38.670
I don't know anything about her.
I don't even know her name anymore.

698
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:43.260
How come I have to keep paying for it?
So I just want to stop now.

699
00:44:43.261 --> 00:44:45.390
Why is it going to be actually difficult for that,

700
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.200
that generation to stop?
You know,

701
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:51.450
I just don't want to give my money to that first generation.

702
00:44:51.451 --> 00:44:54.160
I couldn't care less.
Let's stop right now.
Yup.

703
00:44:59.050 --> 00:44:59.780
<v 3>Okay.</v>

704
00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:01.580
<v 0>Roll mother.
Exactly.</v>

705
00:45:01.581 --> 00:45:05.480
So you can't stop just in the middle because it's,
it's,

706
00:45:05.481 --> 00:45:08.480
it's like the gift is being reenacted every generation.

707
00:45:08.481 --> 00:45:10.820
So the new generation that stops,
you know,

708
00:45:10.821 --> 00:45:13.520
even if they understand where the whole thing began,

709
00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:16.490
they're not going to screw the original mother.

710
00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:19.190
They're going to screw their own mother,
which they probably don't want to do.

711
00:45:19.191 --> 00:45:23.060
So they're not going to want to stop the thing.
Okay.
So that's what,
uh,
okay.

712
00:45:23.061 --> 00:45:25.970
So to say,
the parallel very shortly,

713
00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:30.010
the first generation that got taxes,
uh,

714
00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:33.140
it's got benefits without contributing anything.

715
00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:37.940
That was a huge amount of money that they got every generation after that lost

716
00:45:37.941 --> 00:45:40.280
money.
But that was all,
you know,

717
00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:44.900
a way to pay the first generation and you can't stop the cycle without screwing

718
00:45:44.901 --> 00:45:49.130
your own parents.
And so it's very difficult for the thing to be stopped.
Okay.

719
00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:54.160
So now you could make it a little bit more realistic by saying,

720
00:45:55.070 --> 00:45:59.870
uh,
every people,
every generation,
um,
the interest rate,
you know,
the,

721
00:45:59.871 --> 00:46:01.850
there's a growth,
you know,
wages grow,

722
00:46:01.851 --> 00:46:05.720
every generation saved between one and 2% in real terms.

723
00:46:05.721 --> 00:46:09.320
That's the historical rate of growth.
By the way,
it hasn't been so great lately,

724
00:46:09.321 --> 00:46:13.520
but anyway,
historically say one to 2% real growth of wages.

725
00:46:13.521 --> 00:46:15.080
So on an annualized basis,

726
00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:20.090
if you did the same thing with each generation pain,
um,

727
00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:23.240
12% of their youthful wages,

728
00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:27.080
you would find that now we're coming closer to reality,

729
00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:32.260
that every generation was going to get between one and 2% return on their,

730
00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:37.660
on their contributions because the young would contribute $12 out of 100 say,

731
00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:42.710
but their daughter,
that lady's daughter,
you know,
30 years later,

732
00:46:42.711 --> 00:46:46.220
the wages would have grown by one to 2% every year for those 30 years.

733
00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.880
So 12% of that bigger number would go to the,
to the,
to that daughter.

734
00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:54.350
And so there wouldn't be a rate of return between one and 2% and that's exactly

735
00:46:54.351 --> 00:46:56.420
what Bush and everybody else's predicting.

736
00:46:56.421 --> 00:47:00.770
So now you understand where the one to 2% comes from,
that uh,

737
00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:04.430
your,
your going to get,
if the population is stable,

738
00:47:04.431 --> 00:47:05.960
the ratio of young to old,

739
00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:09.680
the rate of return on social security is going to be equal to the rate of growth

740
00:47:09.681 --> 00:47:10.520
of wages.

741
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:14.120
So it's not zero as in the first parable because wages are actually growing.

742
00:47:14.121 --> 00:47:18.290
It's between one and 2%,
which is a bad return compared to the rate of interest.

743
00:47:18.291 --> 00:47:23.270
And that's why every generation is losing.
Okay.
So let's,
uh,

744
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:25.700
let's do one more thing.

745
00:47:25.701 --> 00:47:29.980
So the baby boom does the baby will make things worse or better.
Okay.

746
00:47:29.981 --> 00:47:33.850
So how can you think about,
said this is so,
so simple minded to think this way.

747
00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:36.280
It's amazing.
The public is so confused about this.

748
00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:39.190
So suppose you have a baby boom generation.

749
00:47:39.191 --> 00:47:42.160
So you're going on with all these mothers were back to the mother and the

750
00:47:42.161 --> 00:47:46.180
daughter with the,
you know,
1 million.
And so let's say there's one mother,

751
00:47:46.181 --> 00:47:48.430
one daughter,
you know,
one person in every generation,

752
00:47:48.431 --> 00:47:52.960
all of a sudden there's a baby boom generation.
But of course,

753
00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:58.210
to be old you have to be young first.
So let's say in some generation,

754
00:47:58.211 --> 00:48:03.070
after a bunch of times,
there are two daughters instead of one daughter,

755
00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:07.840
uh,
they're each paying.
Uh,
okay.
There are two daughters instead of one daughter.

756
00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:10.780
So each of them is now going to pay.

757
00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:12.053
<v 4>MMM.</v>

758
00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:16.880
<v 0>If the tax rate stays the same and the young,</v>

759
00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:20.060
the young daughters now each pay one,
okay.

760
00:48:20.061 --> 00:48:23.360
The mother who's alive then only needs one when she gets old.

761
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:27.140
So $2.
Now two daughters now have one to contribute.

762
00:48:27.141 --> 00:48:31.700
So half of their money goes to paying off the,
the,
the mother when she's old,

763
00:48:31.701 --> 00:48:35.120
just like w what would have usually happened,
but the baby generation,

764
00:48:35.121 --> 00:48:38.180
because you know,
it's young first.
That means when I was young,

765
00:48:38.181 --> 00:48:40.970
my generation was making a huge amount of money,
paying a huge,

766
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.430
we're doing it now.
That's why those,
the surplus,

767
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:46.610
there's this gigantic surplus being put into social security.

768
00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:49.400
And so when my generation gets old,

769
00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:53.840
the dollar that didn't have to go to the mother because there was an extra

770
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:58.280
dollar there that could be earning the rate of interest.
And so at the end,

771
00:48:58.281 --> 00:48:59.120
when we get old,

772
00:48:59.121 --> 00:49:02.420
they're going to be two of us and there's only gonna be one child,

773
00:49:02.421 --> 00:49:06.710
next generation to contribute one.
And we're going to expecting to,
but see,

774
00:49:06.711 --> 00:49:09.770
the one that was put in when we were young has now grown to two.

775
00:49:09.771 --> 00:49:12.170
So you've got to there plus another one,
that's three.

776
00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:15.660
So they're actually should be a surplus,
not a deficit.
Did you follow that?

777
00:49:15.661 --> 00:49:19.670
Did that go too fast?
So,
uh,
I'm saying that,
you know,

778
00:49:19.671 --> 00:49:24.060
every generation you give one,
you get one,
you get one,
you get one,
you give one,

779
00:49:24.061 --> 00:49:28.310
you get one.
All of a sudden there are two people.
So they're,

780
00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:31.040
they're each giving one.
So none,
none of them is better off,

781
00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:34.280
is worse off than before.
When they get old,
they're going to need to,

782
00:49:34.281 --> 00:49:37.970
and you've only got one person contributing.
So here's the baby boom,
you know,

783
00:49:37.971 --> 00:49:42.680
double the size of all the other generations.
So when they're old,

784
00:49:42.681 --> 00:49:45.080
it looks like a problem.
Who's going to take care of these people?
That,

785
00:49:45.081 --> 00:49:46.850
not enough young people to take care of them.

786
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:49.130
But remember they were young before they were old.

787
00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:52.370
So since this mother only needs one and there are two of these daughters,

788
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:56.600
the extra one could be invested and the one that's invested is going to make a

789
00:49:56.601 --> 00:49:59.540
rate of return and become more than one,
like close to two.

790
00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:03.980
And so you'll have the one from the new daughter plus almost to from,

791
00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:07.090
from that was,
you know,
saved and earned,
uh,
you know,

792
00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:09.560
that's in the social security trust fund and earning interest.

793
00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:12.590
So you'll actually have $3 to make up for the two.

794
00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:15.860
And so it's not a problem at all,
but you had the baby boom.
In fact,

795
00:50:15.861 --> 00:50:19.790
it's a benefit that we had the baby boom.
So basically what did the baby boom do?

796
00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:24.230
It staved off the original problem.
So let's just think about this one more time.

797
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:26.930
Suppose that you,

798
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:30.490
a slightly more realistic example of the kind you're going to do on that problem

799
00:50:30.491 --> 00:50:34.870
set.
So suppose that you've got,
um,
uh,

800
00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:38.720
people live for four from 20 to 80,

801
00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:43.960
and they pay taxes and work from 20 to 60 and they retire from 60 to 80.

802
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:45.081
Okay.

803
00:50:45.081 --> 00:50:49.010
And everybody's paying $12 in social security taxes when working and there's a

804
00:50:49.011 --> 00:50:53.330
zero rate of interest and they're getting 24,
maybe I have a rate of rent.

805
00:50:53.331 --> 00:50:56.900
They're getting $24 when they're retired and benefits.
Okay.

806
00:50:56.901 --> 00:51:01.170
So the system balances every year because in every generation it's w these are

807
00:51:01.171 --> 00:51:03.710
the birth years.
The thing started,
you know,

808
00:51:03.711 --> 00:51:08.711
in 1938 and then they collect the taxes for a little while and then they start,

809
00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:10.880
I mean,
they,
they,
uh,
you know,

810
00:51:10.881 --> 00:51:14.620
Francis Perkins got inaction and so they decided to go to pay as you go is,

811
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:17.570
let's just assume it started pay as you go from the very beginning.

812
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:21.560
So in 1940,
so you see in 1940,

813
00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:26.420
the people who are 60,
the 1880 generation would have two decades to live.

814
00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:31.230
So these guys,
Oh,
I'm sorry,
I never put this,

815
00:51:31.231 --> 00:51:36.180
uh,
not that it mattered,
but would have been a little better.
So these guys,

816
00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:40.620
um,
you know,
the,
the,
the 60 year olds in the sec,
you know,

817
00:51:40.621 --> 00:51:43.710
the 60 year olds here and these 70 year olds,

818
00:51:43.711 --> 00:51:46.980
the seven year olds and the 60 year olds are collecting money.

819
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:50.480
Now the original start of social security was a little fuzzy.

820
00:51:50.481 --> 00:51:52.670
They didn't want to pay people who had never contributed,

821
00:51:52.671 --> 00:51:56.160
but so these 70 year olds weren't really getting anything right?
But okay,

822
00:51:56.161 --> 00:52:00.120
let's just keep for the simple steady state.
So the um,

823
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:05.150
so the point is the 60 year olds are collecting $24 the 70 year olds and

824
00:52:05.361 --> 00:52:08.610
collecting $24 and each of these generations,
the 50,

825
00:52:08.611 --> 00:52:11.340
40 thirties and twenties they're all paying $12.

826
00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:15.000
So the contributions are exactly matching the benefits.

827
00:52:15.001 --> 00:52:18.750
So the system is perfectly in balance.
Okay.
Now what happens the next Gen,

828
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:22.410
the next decade you've got these,
the new,

829
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:24.000
the new 70 year olds,

830
00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:29.210
that's this next generation plus these guys who have now turned 70 okay,

831
00:52:29.701 --> 00:52:32.910
who had,
who had been contributing before and now they're in their sixties sorry,

832
00:52:32.911 --> 00:52:35.940
they're in their sixties these guys in their seventies these guys in their

833
00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:37.680
sixties and then here are the contributors.

834
00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:40.680
This new generation has now come on board to contribute.
So again,

835
00:52:40.681 --> 00:52:42.990
there's balance every generation,
okay,

836
00:52:42.991 --> 00:52:45.990
but now who are the winners and the losers?
Well,
you know,

837
00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:49.980
it's much worse than it sounded at first glance because people live longer than

838
00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:53.500
one year.
So you see these people in the,

839
00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:57.180
from the forties in the forties all these guys were gaining.

840
00:52:57.210 --> 00:53:01.980
So this generation of 1870s they have almost an infinite rate of return.

841
00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:05.400
They made no contributions,
okay?
These guys,

842
00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:09.870
they also made no contributions and they're getting huge returns because they're

843
00:53:09.871 --> 00:53:13.140
getting them,
you know,
20 years of returns.

844
00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:17.160
But it's worse than that because when we go to the next generation,
these guys,

845
00:53:17.161 --> 00:53:21.030
they actually contributed when they are in their city in their fifties but that

846
00:53:21.031 --> 00:53:25.980
wasn't very long before they retired.
And they got,
you know,
24 they got,
you know,

847
00:53:25.981 --> 00:53:30.981
they've got $24 of benefits and $24 of benefits having only paid $12 of taxes.

848
00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.490
Of course this came later,

849
00:53:32.491 --> 00:53:36.390
but 48 compared to 12 they got a gigantic rate of return.
Well,

850
00:53:36.391 --> 00:53:40.230
you go to the next generation and they're making out like bandits too because

851
00:53:40.231 --> 00:53:42.330
they only contributed twice.
Okay.

852
00:53:42.331 --> 00:53:45.990
So in the forties a bunch of people were making money getting benefits.

853
00:53:45.991 --> 00:53:49.950
Who didn't make any contributions in the fifties a bunch of people were making,

854
00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:51.540
uh,
getting benefits.

855
00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:56.490
Who made no contributions in the 60s there are still people getting benefits who

856
00:53:56.491 --> 00:53:57.630
made no contributions.

857
00:53:57.631 --> 00:54:01.620
It's not to get to the seventies 40 years or the eighties what am I talking

858
00:54:01.621 --> 00:54:03.990
about?
The eighties once people are fully retired,

859
00:54:03.991 --> 00:54:06.490
you don't have made 40 years of contributions.

860
00:54:06.491 --> 00:54:11.491
So from 40 to 80 it's not until the 80s that the people who are getting benefits

861
00:54:12.151 --> 00:54:14.700
were all people who fully contributed.
Okay.

862
00:54:14.701 --> 00:54:18.360
So all these people were getting an incredibly good deal.

863
00:54:18.361 --> 00:54:22.710
We had 40 years of people getting you know,
extra returns.

864
00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:27.890
So if you just do the distributor of law of Arithmetic and you realize that all

865
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:30.870
these things go off to infinity because they're discounted,

866
00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:35.130
you can sum them in either direction.
You can some down the columns.
Okay,

867
00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:39.030
that's always zero.
The benefits and the contributions always net to zero.

868
00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:43.800
But therefore if you add up the rose,
which is what each generation gets,

869
00:54:43.801 --> 00:54:45.570
they also have to add up to zero.

870
00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:50.310
But you see there's so many original generations.
This one got a huge benefit.

871
00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:52.020
This one got huge benefits.

872
00:54:52.021 --> 00:54:55.380
The present value of their contributions relative to their benefits is

873
00:54:55.381 --> 00:54:58.620
incredibly positive for that generation.
For this generations.

874
00:54:58.621 --> 00:54:59.800
It's still incredibly pause.

875
00:54:59.801 --> 00:55:04.350
And remember this is 1212 and this is 24 24 for those generations is probably

876
00:55:04.351 --> 00:55:08.250
still positive.
Not till you get to hear has it become,
you know,

877
00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:12.180
well not that you get to hear to something changed.
So this is a positive number.

878
00:55:12.181 --> 00:55:13.440
This is a big positive number.

879
00:55:13.441 --> 00:55:16.320
This is a gigantic positive number and this is a huge positive number.

880
00:55:16.321 --> 00:55:18.750
You add up over all these things,
positives,

881
00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:23.490
the rest of these generations have to be negative to just balance the thing at

882
00:55:23.491 --> 00:55:27.930
zero.
So that's why every generation from here down to here is going to half day,

883
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:30.750
earn a negative return.
Basically the s in steady state,

884
00:55:30.751 --> 00:55:35.700
they'd all earn the same negative present value or the same bad rate of return.

885
00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:38.880
And there were so many generations that got positive amounts of money.

886
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.260
So in today's dollars,

887
00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:43.890
can you tell me how much money that we gave away to these early generations?

888
00:55:43.891 --> 00:55:46.470
Can you take a guess?
Just order of magnitude.

889
00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.020
<v 2>Okay,</v>

890
00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:52.620
<v 0>so I'm asking in today's dollars,
in today's present value dollars.</v>

891
00:55:52.621 --> 00:55:53.550
So whatever the number is,

892
00:55:53.551 --> 00:55:55.890
you have to assume it grew at the rate of interest in that.

893
00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:57.750
So what do you think that is?

894
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:59.670
<v 2>Right?</v>

895
00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:02.640
<v 0>Couple trillion.
Does anyone want to guess?
Reasonable gas,</v>

896
00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:04.410
but someone making them want to make another gas.

897
00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:08.190
Just so you get an idea of the size of the program.

898
00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:12.070
Does anyone know what g and P is in the country?

899
00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:15.000
<v 2>Brilliant.</v>

900
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.840
<v 0>Okay.
14 trillion.
Something like that is GMP.
So what?</v>

901
00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:23.150
So what do you guess this number is?
Okay.

902
00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:27.340
17 trillion.
So he gets 2 trillion.
It's 17 trillion.

903
00:56:27.341 --> 00:56:32.341
So we made a staggering transfer of income to these people at the beginning and

904
00:56:33.101 --> 00:56:34.660
now somebody's got to pay for that.

905
00:56:34.661 --> 00:56:37.540
And it's not a trivial thing to pay for it because 17 trillion,

906
00:56:37.541 --> 00:56:40.960
if everybody gave every,
every corporation,
every,
you know,

907
00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:44.200
person in the whole country gave away all the money they made for a year,

908
00:56:44.201 --> 00:56:46.330
we still wouldn't pay it down.
Okay?

909
00:56:46.331 --> 00:56:50.740
So that's a big amount that's hanging over everybody.
Okay?

910
00:56:50.741 --> 00:56:52.930
And that's what the social security problem is.

911
00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:57.310
We gave away so much money at the beginning.
If we keep the system in balance,

912
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:58.000
we're never,

913
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.140
we have to gradually give all the money back and we can't stop it because then

914
00:57:02.141 --> 00:57:05.740
some old guys are going to get screwed.
So there's no way of stopping the thing.

915
00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:08.230
And,
uh,
each generation has to lose.

916
00:57:08.231 --> 00:57:13.030
So the reason why you're getting such low rates of return is because the system

917
00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:15.670
was designed.
Frances Perkins knew what she was doing.

918
00:57:15.671 --> 00:57:18.220
She wanted to help all those old people in the forties.

919
00:57:18.221 --> 00:57:21.130
Now she was out of power in the fifties and sixties,
you know,

920
00:57:21.131 --> 00:57:23.200
when we were still helping all those people.
But the point is,

921
00:57:23.201 --> 00:57:27.670
was a tremendous transfer of wealth to the retire generations of that era.

922
00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:31.960
And that's the reason why everybody's getting such a bad rate of return.
Now.

923
00:57:31.961 --> 00:57:36.100
It's not because the is being lost or thrown away.
Okay?

924
00:57:36.101 --> 00:57:40.570
So what I'm telling you now is not controversial.
Um,

925
00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:43.750
you know,
I don't think many people understand it,
but it's,
you know,

926
00:57:43.751 --> 00:57:47.020
everyone who does understand that agrees with it when we come to my solution

927
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:51.130
that they're not going to agree.
But anyway,
so what I'm telling you,
so,
uh,

928
00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:53.590
so just to compute some,
so during the problem set,

929
00:57:53.591 --> 00:57:57.180
you have to compute an example.
So let's just see,
uh,

930
00:57:57.370 --> 00:57:58.960
how this would work.

931
00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:03.190
So suppose from the point of view of a 10 year old,

932
00:58:03.191 --> 00:58:08.191
just doing the example I did suppose there's a 15% rate of interest and your

933
00:58:08.351 --> 00:58:13.351
going to contribute in your 20 $12 12% $12 in your,

934
00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:14.920
so no growth in the economy.

935
00:58:14.921 --> 00:58:18.250
So it's $12 all the time when you're in your twenties thirties,

936
00:58:18.251 --> 00:58:20.410
forties and 50s okay.

937
00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:25.000
So what would you do from the point of view of age 10 that's 10 years below

938
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:26.530
before,
uh,

939
00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:30.580
your 20s you're going to contribute $12 in your twenties you discounted at the

940
00:58:30.581 --> 00:58:34.420
15% rate of interest you're going to be doing,
you know,

941
00:58:34.421 --> 00:58:39.421
contributing $12 in your thirties you discounted at 15% twice in your forties

942
00:58:39.641 --> 00:58:44.590
you're doing giving up $12 you're discounting it to a 15% three times and your

943
00:58:44.591 --> 00:58:48.460
50s you're doing it $12 you're just counting it four times.

944
00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:52.480
So that's the present value of what you've,
you know,

945
00:58:52.481 --> 00:58:54.300
from the point of view of a cha,
you know,

946
00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:58.420
a young girl looking at what you're going to be forced to contribute over your

947
00:58:58.421 --> 00:59:02.590
life.
Those are the taxes you can expect to pay in present value terms.

948
00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:06.190
Now of course,
when you get old in your sixties and seventies,

949
00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:08.770
you're going to get,
um,
you know,

950
00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:12.430
you can get benefits $24 much higher than the taxes you paid.

951
00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:16.600
But by then it's five decades later.
So you're just counting it five times.

952
00:59:16.601 --> 00:59:20.080
And when you're in your seventies,
you're discounting it six times.

953
00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:23.090
So you have to divide,
you know,
discount by six.

954
00:59:23.091 --> 00:59:26.570
And so the present value of that is way less than the present value of this.

955
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:31.930
So you see that the loss in present value terms is going to be $11 $11 out of 34

956
00:59:35.031 --> 00:59:39.500
which is what your benefits were.
So your loss is something like 34%.

957
00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:43.490
So this is just a,
you know,
I just made up these numbers.
The actual loss,

958
00:59:43.491 --> 00:59:48.200
which I computed for the real economy was,
is around 25%.

959
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:53.450
So that's how,
how big each generation,
a quarter of the typical.

960
00:59:53.451 --> 00:59:58.270
So here it's 34% a quarter to a third.
And this example of each generation,

961
00:59:58.290 --> 01:00:03.110
social security taxes are simply being lost.
Frittered away and handed,
you know,

962
01:00:03.111 --> 01:00:07.550
basically used to pay off that,
that urge the debt from the original generation.

963
01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.630
Okay.
Uh,

964
01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:11.350
<v 2>yeah.</v>

965
01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:15.580
<v 0>Now if you want to look at the total present value loss starting in,</v>

966
01:00:15.581 --> 01:00:20.080
in the 1930s,
you have to,
for people born in the 1930s.
Okay?

967
01:00:20.081 --> 01:00:23.580
You have to look at every generation's losing the seventh,

968
01:00:23.581 --> 01:00:25.270
same 1195.

969
01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:29.910
And so you take the infinite future of generations and they're losing 79,

970
01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:34.480
68 if you add up to infinity.
And of course,
that's the,
uh,

971
01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:38.620
that's the gain that was given to the original generations.
Okay?

972
01:00:38.621 --> 01:00:40.870
So that's the,
okay,

973
01:00:40.871 --> 01:00:44.530
so that's the kind of example you're going to work out except for with realistic

974
01:00:44.531 --> 01:00:48.760
numbers.
Okay.
And so I just do one,

975
01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:51.690
but you're going to do that anyway.
All right,
so that's it.

976
01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:56.520
So now if you look at which generations got the most money,
um,

977
01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:59.670
you know,
at the beginning there weren't many people in social security.

978
01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:04.080
And so the amount of money that they got,
the benefits,
the really old God,

979
01:01:04.081 --> 01:01:08.190
there were so few of them that if you add it up,
it wasn't that big.
But so the,

980
01:01:08.191 --> 01:01:13.191
the generation that benefited the most was my father's generation and James

981
01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:16.170
Tobin's generation Tobin,
as we'll see in a second.

982
01:01:16.171 --> 01:01:17.430
He used to tell me all the time.

983
01:01:17.431 --> 01:01:20.970
So he was Yale's most famous economists and I happened to be the James Tobin

984
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.630
professors.
I have quite a fondness form.
And uh,
I did.

985
01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:28.500
So it went to the same high school.
We went to an Illinois.
Anyway,
he,
uh,

986
01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.010
he used to tell me that the problem with social security was we didn't have

987
01:01:32.011 --> 01:01:32.490
enough.
You know,

988
01:01:32.490 --> 01:01:35.880
I didn't have enough children and I would tell him the problem social security

989
01:01:35.881 --> 01:01:38.400
was we gave him his birthday,
too much money.

990
01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:40.440
And that's why we're all suffering now.

991
01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:43.260
So you can see all the generations in which one's,

992
01:01:43.261 --> 01:01:47.790
which generation got the most amount of money.
So that also calculated.

993
01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:53.460
Okay,
so now this parable is not exactly accurate.

994
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:58.360
So,
by the way,
so you know,
in the parable we should have had a crisis in 19 um,

995
01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:03.510
70 you should have been in 1980 I told you the people in 1980 should already

996
01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:08.690
have a realized the generation starting to work in 1980 so born in 1960 a lot

997
01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:10.711
younger than you are.

998
01:02:10.711 --> 01:02:14.010
They should already have realized that they were getting a bad deal in social

999
01:02:14.011 --> 01:02:16.890
security.
And so we should have had all of this come much sooner.

1000
01:02:17.010 --> 01:02:19.980
So what kept what the Jen,
you know,

1001
01:02:19.981 --> 01:02:24.120
what kept the problem from manifesting itself until now?
Well,

1002
01:02:24.121 --> 01:02:26.370
what kept the problem for manifesting itself till now,

1003
01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:31.371
it's actually quite easy to see is there were a lot more young people per old in

1004
01:02:31.611 --> 01:02:33.930
the,
in the historical generations.
And you know,

1005
01:02:33.931 --> 01:02:37.770
now we're leveling off and everybody thinks they're going to be,
you know,

1006
01:02:37.771 --> 01:02:39.420
to young people for every old,

1007
01:02:39.421 --> 01:02:44.421
the story I sorta 12 told working from 40 to 60 and retired from 60 to 80 and a

1008
01:02:44.611 --> 01:02:48.180
stable population that's coming close to what we're converging to.

1009
01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:51.030
So they're going to be too young for every old where either there's,

1010
01:02:51.031 --> 01:02:53.620
there used to be three,
four and five.
Now how could it,

1011
01:02:53.621 --> 01:02:56.970
there've been so many young for all the old,
well,
you know,

1012
01:02:56.971 --> 01:03:00.430
women at the beginning weren't,
we're,
we're,
you know,

1013
01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:04.640
in this period they were working,
women were surging into the labor force,

1014
01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:06.300
the huge number of young women working,

1015
01:03:06.301 --> 01:03:09.690
but their mothers actually weren't working.
They had not worked.

1016
01:03:09.691 --> 01:03:12.480
And so they were getting half their husband's benefits,

1017
01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:17.490
not the full benefit that these daughters who are working their whole lives are

1018
01:03:17.491 --> 01:03:19.740
going to get.
They're not going to take half their husband's benefits.

1019
01:03:19.741 --> 01:03:22.440
They're going to take all their own benefits,
which are going to be a lot higher.

1020
01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:27.030
So,
um,
you know,
then there was the baby boom generation,

1021
01:03:27.031 --> 01:03:31.080
the baby boom generation far from causing the problem has deferred the problem.

1022
01:03:31.081 --> 01:03:35.790
You know,
they're all these surpluses cause we were working so long.
Okay.
So,
um,

1023
01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:40.200
I don't want to get into all the details.
Um,
people are living longer now too,

1024
01:03:40.201 --> 01:03:43.890
so that's another problem.
Okay.
So,
uh,

1025
01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:48.750
too much complication here.
Okay.
So what can you do about this?

1026
01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:53.910
Well,
there's obvious things to do,
which

1027
01:03:55.770 --> 01:03:59.410
are bad.
So one thing you could do is you could say,
well,

1028
01:03:59.411 --> 01:04:03.120
if we're supposed to be paying the average young person,
40%,
uh,

1029
01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:07.320
of the new generations wages and they're only going to be to young people for

1030
01:04:07.321 --> 01:04:11.130
every old people person,
um,
you know,

1031
01:04:11.131 --> 01:04:13.410
we can maybe shave the 40% down a little bit.

1032
01:04:13.410 --> 01:04:17.220
Let's make the social security tax 18% instead of 12%.

1033
01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:21.780
So you could raise it by 6%.
Okay?
That would be,
uh,
uh,

1034
01:04:21.781 --> 01:04:25.900
shocking.
Okay.
So I think that nobody wants to actually do that because,
you know,

1035
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.790
uh,

1036
01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:31.740
increase of 6% and the tax rate is an astronomical increase in,

1037
01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:36.810
and you can read in the newspapers how loaf congress's to whit raising taxes

1038
01:04:37.050 --> 01:04:41.390
get,
another obvious thing you could do is you could reduce the,
you know,

1039
01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:46.360
raise retirement age.
So instead of saying it's 65 cause people live,
you know,

1040
01:04:46.410 --> 01:04:50.790
til 80,
make it start at 67 so you don't have to pay them,
you know,

1041
01:04:50.791 --> 01:04:55.020
for 15,
you're 13 years instead of 15 years.
And this example,
you know,

1042
01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:59.040
18 years instead of 20 years.
So you could keep raising the retirement age.

1043
01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:02.190
The problem with that is not the retirement age,

1044
01:05:02.191 --> 01:05:05.310
the age you start collecting social security.
The problem with that of course,

1045
01:05:05.311 --> 01:05:09.090
is that people are retiring,
not later and later,

1046
01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:11.280
even younger and younger,
believe it or not.

1047
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:14.490
And so you're getting this huge gap between when people retired,

1048
01:05:14.491 --> 01:05:16.780
when they start getting social security.
So there's a limit.

1049
01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:19.840
So obviously you should do a little bit of that,
but there's a limit of how much,

1050
01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:24.880
how much of that you can do.
So you need to make not just the parametric reform,

1051
01:05:24.881 --> 01:05:28.540
you know,
like adjusting a number,
changing the tax rate a little bit.

1052
01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:30.970
But I believe you need a fundamental reform.

1053
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:34.930
And the Republicans have proposed one.
They've said,
let's prioritize,

1054
01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:39.250
let's change the whole system.
Okay.
So,
um,

1055
01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:40.643
<v 2>okay.</v>

1056
01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:47.060
<v 0>Okay.
So what does it mean to prioritize?
How are they going to do that?</v>

1057
01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:49.760
So what Bush had in mind,

1058
01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:54.830
what Bush had in mind was the following.
He said,
uh,

1059
01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:59.180
what is privatization?
It involves three things.

1060
01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:02.900
It's the creation of individual accounts.
So your name goes on it.

1061
01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:06.110
So it's your account,
your money,
and no one can take it from you.

1062
01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:10.120
It's your money and your money is what's going to pay for your own benefits.

1063
01:06:10.121 --> 01:06:13.110
So it's pre funded.
Okay.
So it's individual counseling,

1064
01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:15.650
pre funded and it's diversification.

1065
01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:20.210
You're supposed to invest not just in government bonds but in the stock market,

1066
01:06:20.211 --> 01:06:23.840
whatever else you want.
So those are the three cornerstones of,
of our,

1067
01:06:23.841 --> 01:06:26.330
at least the way I've explained them of privatization,

1068
01:06:26.331 --> 01:06:29.180
three things and accomplish.
And so it gives you your name on the money.

1069
01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:30.580
It's your money.

1070
01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:33.540
That's the money that's going to pay you when you get old pre funding.

1071
01:06:33.830 --> 01:06:37.940
And you could invest in a wider range of assets,
especially the stock market,

1072
01:06:37.941 --> 01:06:39.920
which is what everybody seems to want to put their money in,

1073
01:06:39.921 --> 01:06:42.740
or at least used to until we had this last crash.
On the other hand,

1074
01:06:42.741 --> 01:06:45.470
the stock market's going up a lot,
so people are getting less nervous about it.

1075
01:06:45.471 --> 01:06:49.850
So,
um,
those things are different.
They're not the same.

1076
01:06:51.350 --> 01:06:54.590
Okay.
So now,
how is a Bush going to handle this?

1077
01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:59.150
So how would you think he was going to do this?
How can you possibly say?

1078
01:06:59.151 --> 01:07:01.310
So Bush said,
I want a privatized,

1079
01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:04.790
I want the 12% that you pay and social security taxes,

1080
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000
I want 4% of that for you to be able to put that in your private account and the

1081
01:07:10.431 --> 01:07:14.870
stock market with your name on it.
Okay.
So Gore said,
well that's ridiculous.

1082
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:18.320
If it's only 8% then left to give to the old people,

1083
01:07:18.321 --> 01:07:21.210
the old people are going to get cheated.
So how,

1084
01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:24.140
how has Bush going to handle that?
What do you think he was going to do?

1085
01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:35.150
Could you say it again?
Sounds right,
but I couldn't see horrible.
Horrible.
Okay.

1086
01:07:35.151 --> 01:07:38.450
Exactly.
So I mean,
I don't know what Gore was thinking,

1087
01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:43.280
especially since I was supposedly advising Gore about social security.
Um,

1088
01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:47.060
you know,
but he just said in the debate,
that's impossible.

1089
01:07:47.061 --> 01:07:51.650
You'll just grow all the old people.
So,
okay,
so you're supposed to be giving 12%,

1090
01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:56.570
you know,
12 here minus 12 here,
and then getting some return over here.

1091
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:58.070
And now Bush is saying,

1092
01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:03.100
I only want to give you $8 and the other four you put in your social security

1093
01:08:03.441 --> 01:08:07.280
account and then you're going to get maybe a much bigger return here cause it's

1094
01:08:07.281 --> 01:08:11.990
sorry,
in your stock market account in social security.
So you can't take it out.

1095
01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:14.720
So Bush would say yes,
let people put their names on it,

1096
01:08:14.721 --> 01:08:18.950
forced to save and contribute the whole $12 Bush agrees that you got to force

1097
01:08:18.951 --> 01:08:21.350
young people to save because they're not going to do it otherwise.

1098
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:23.780
So you put the $4 in their private account,

1099
01:08:23.781 --> 01:08:27.230
but it's their name on it and then it grows to some huge number,
you know,

1100
01:08:27.231 --> 01:08:30.920
20 instead of just doubling by the time they get old.

1101
01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:35.360
And so that huge account is their money.
So,
um,

1102
01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:39.350
that's what Bush would say.
So Gora would say,

1103
01:08:39.351 --> 01:08:43.590
well if you take these $4 and give it to them,
how are you going to,
uh,
how,

1104
01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:47.570
how are you going to,
you know,
pay the old people who need the 12 right up here.

1105
01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.460
The old people are supposed to get 12.

1106
01:08:49.461 --> 01:08:52.100
How are you going to give them their 12 when the young aren't handing over the

1107
01:08:52.101 --> 01:08:52.761
12 anymore?

1108
01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:56.960
They're only handing over eight well it's not like Bush and his advisors didn't

1109
01:08:56.961 --> 01:09:00.020
think about that.
That would,
you know,
that would be a colossal blunder.

1110
01:09:00.021 --> 01:09:03.230
Of course they thought about that.
So what were they going to do?

1111
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:07.790
They were going to have the government go out and borrow the other four.

1112
01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:09.710
So the government contributes for that.

1113
01:09:09.711 --> 01:09:13.280
It borrows and now of course over here the government's going to have to owe

1114
01:09:13.281 --> 01:09:16.310
eight cause it's got to pay back the four it owed.
You know,

1115
01:09:16.311 --> 01:09:19.880
in 30 years we're assuming a hundred percent interest over 30 years.

1116
01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:21.770
He's got to pay back the eight you're all with me.

1117
01:09:21.771 --> 01:09:26.540
So where are they going to get the eight
who are they?

1118
01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.950
Who are they going to get the eight from

1119
01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:32.560
<v 1>what?
Which taxpayer?</v>

1120
01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:36.190
Everybody really?

1121
01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.530
<v 0>Okay.
These people.
So if this,</v>

1122
01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:46.210
if you chose to take four of your dollars out of social security and put it into

1123
01:09:46.211 --> 01:09:50.200
your social security stock market trust fund,

1124
01:09:50.350 --> 01:09:51.820
your personal trust fund,

1125
01:09:52.570 --> 01:09:56.680
the deal is you have to pay the interest.
At the end of 30 years.

1126
01:09:56.681 --> 01:10:00.820
So this eight comes out of your 20.
Okay.
So,
so the government,

1127
01:10:00.821 --> 01:10:04.240
so these people,
uh,
so these people pay back the aide.

1128
01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:07.150
So basically to say it in a different way,

1129
01:10:07.450 --> 01:10:10.480
the way you get to invest in the stock market,

1130
01:10:10.481 --> 01:10:13.990
according to the Bush privatization rules,
is these people,

1131
01:10:13.991 --> 01:10:17.230
effectively they're giving the $12 anyway to the old,

1132
01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:22.320
but they get to borrow $4 and put it in their private stock market account and

1133
01:10:22.691 --> 01:10:25.750
then they have to pay back the mount they borrowed with interest,
which is eight.

1134
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:30.670
But if the stock market does better than the,
uh,
than the interest rate,

1135
01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:34.510
then of course they,
they make out better.
They get 20 minus eight,
which is 12.

1136
01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:36.960
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1137
01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:40.830
<v 0>Okay.
So is that a clear how he did it?
So it's not a logical impossibility.</v>

1138
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:42.870
The problem with the Bush plan of course,

1139
01:10:42.871 --> 01:10:47.370
is that if the money you put in the stock market earns the same rate of return

1140
01:10:47.610 --> 01:10:50.550
that you would have gotten anyway.
Uh,
you know,

1141
01:10:50.551 --> 01:10:54.180
if the stock market earns the same rate of return 100% over all those years as

1142
01:10:54.181 --> 01:10:55.014
the bond market,

1143
01:10:55.230 --> 01:11:00.150
then this private stash you have just goes back to paying off the government

1144
01:11:00.151 --> 01:11:02.610
debt and you haven't gained anything in the stock market.

1145
01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:06.000
You get the same social security benefits you would have had anyway.

1146
01:11:06.150 --> 01:11:09.120
So these guys who opt into the privatization program,

1147
01:11:09.121 --> 01:11:13.260
let me repeat the Bush plan.
If you opt into the privatization program,

1148
01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:17.490
you affectively do everything you did before and social security,

1149
01:11:17.491 --> 01:11:19.560
you pay your taxes that go to the old people.

1150
01:11:19.561 --> 01:11:22.740
You get the benefits just like you did before.
But on top of it,

1151
01:11:22.741 --> 01:11:27.390
you have the right to borrow $4 from the government,
invested in stocks,

1152
01:11:27.570 --> 01:11:31.440
and then at the end you have to pay back the government out of your stock market

1153
01:11:31.441 --> 01:11:32.250
return.

1154
01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:35.670
So you're betting on whether the stock market is going to do better than the

1155
01:11:35.671 --> 01:11:39.120
bond market.
That's effectively what the plan was.
Okay?

1156
01:11:39.330 --> 01:11:43.890
So it's not a logical impossibility.
Like Gore said.
On the other hand,

1157
01:11:43.891 --> 01:11:47.430
if you don't think the stock market's going to do better than the bond market,

1158
01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:51.390
you could end up being worse off.
You could have put in $4 here,
get only six,

1159
01:11:51.630 --> 01:11:54.300
and then you'd have to owe the government eight where's the government going to

1160
01:11:54.301 --> 01:11:55.620
get the other $2 from?

1161
01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:59.820
It's going to reduce your social security contributions by two so that's the

1162
01:11:59.821 --> 01:12:04.290
government plan.
Okay,
so in the problem set,
I gave you three problems.

1163
01:12:04.291 --> 01:12:06.360
You can only do two of them.
Now,
the last one,

1164
01:12:06.361 --> 01:12:07.860
I didn't get far enough to have you do.

1165
01:12:07.861 --> 01:12:12.861
So just do two of them and I'm going to give my own a plan next time and also do

1166
01:12:14.521 --> 01:12:17.620
a little mathematics.
It's going to turn out that it's quite interesting to,

1167
01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:19.530
to math this up a little bit.
