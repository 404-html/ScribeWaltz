1
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:01.801
All right.

2
00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:06.690
So we spent a long time reviewing general equilibrium and we've now switched to

3
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:07.524
finance.

4
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.790
And your hopefully going to see that the principles of finance emerge very

5
00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:14.850
quickly from the principles of general equilibrium.

6
00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:17.730
So that although it seems it was a long interlude,

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.140
we've actually learned a lot about the financial economy.
So we,

8
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:25.800
I'm going to continue with the example that we started with last time.

9
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:29.250
So we have a financial economy.
So no financial economy.

10
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:32.130
What is a financial economy on this top board,

11
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.640
the financial economies defined by lots of people in the economy and their

12
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:42.900
utilities.
So that's here we have for simplicity,
two kinds of people,

13
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.930
a and B with utilities given by the log x one plus one f log two,

14
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:48.834
et Cetera.

15
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.930
It's also people know today what their endowments are and they have some idea of

16
00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:56.100
what they're going to be tomorrow.

17
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.430
So here you know their labor power today and they're going to be able to work

18
00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:01.890
again next year.
So the,
uh,

19
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.790
the Labor is a endowments are given a by one,

20
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:07.740
one for a and one zero for B.

21
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.180
And then they also know that there are two stocks in the economy and they have

22
00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:15.390
to anticipate what the dividends are going to be.
And as Fisher said,

23
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:19.350
the main value of assets is that they,
they give you something,

24
00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:20.280
they produce something.

25
00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:23.850
In this case they're going to be dividends and Betas producing given end of two

26
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.360
alphas producing dividend of one next period.
And then they,

27
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.410
they own ownership of a shares.
So that's the beginning of the economy.

28
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.510
And we want to define from that equilibrium which involves who,

29
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.980
what are the contemporaneous price is going to be that's Q for contemporaneous,

30
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:45.210
what are the prices of the stocks going to be and who's going to hold which

31
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.620
portfolio of acids of stocks and who's going to,
who's going to consume what.

32
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.280
And so Fisher said that's a very complicated problem.

33
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.140
You can simplify it by looking at a general equilibrium problem,

34
00:01:58.141 --> 00:02:00.100
which is much shorter describe.

35
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.080
And so the general equilibrium economy is going to be much simpler.
One,

36
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.370
it's going to consist of you a and you be the same as before.

37
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.510
And he hat a one the endowments,

38
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.570
he hat a two and he had B one B two.

39
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.701
Okay.

40
00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:25.701
So we've left out half the variables up there and we define he hat a one equal

41
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:31.230
to eat a one equal to one.

42
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.620
And he had B one equals e v one equal one,

43
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.480
but he had a two.

44
00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:44.481
This is the fissure insight equals e a two plus.

45
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:49.320
What a owns of the payoffs of the future.
Dividends.

46
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.040
A Alpha of the f of the

47
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.320
Beta two.
Okay.
So since a owns half of the Alpha stock,

48
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.010
or sorry,
all of the Alpha stock and half of the Beta stock,

49
00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.700
his endowment is one for what his or his original thing,

50
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:12.460
plus what the stock is going to produce.
And after all,
he's the owner.

51
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.290
So he's going to get half of to,
uh,
all of one

52
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.440
plus a half of two,
which is equal to three.
And so I didn't,

53
00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:26.380
I took more space than I thought.
And so similarly,

54
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.440
he hat B two is going to be one plus a half of two,

55
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.140
which equals two.
Okay.
So here,
um,

56
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.260
the endowments or this
and also,

57
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.360
uh,
let's just write it here.
He had a to equal three.

58
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.520
So this,
okay,
so Fisher sad.

59
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.470
We start with a financial equilibrium.

60
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.030
We can switch to the economic equity Librium and solve this problem and having

61
00:03:58.031 --> 00:04:00.730
solved that one,
go back and figure out how to solve this one.

62
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:05.140
And you remember what the prices were?
They turned out to be few.
One,

63
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.760
I might as well write it up there.
What the prices we had we solved.

64
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.260
We said,
first of all,
Fisher has no theory for the contemporaneous prices.

65
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:15.910
It's all relative prices.

66
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.010
I'm going to write that relative prices as all we can ever figure out.
You know,

67
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:23.980
someone might always come along and change dollars to sense.

68
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:26.650
When I was a little boy and France on vacation,

69
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.340
they suddenly announced that the frank was going to be divided by,
you know,

70
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:33.760
everything that was 100 francs would now be one.
Frank.
And you know,
they just,

71
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:36.400
we redefined the currency.
So that might always happen.

72
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:39.280
So you have to have some theory of money and whether the government's going to

73
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:42.850
do that to figure out the nominal prices.
So the,
uh,

74
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.020
so contemporaneous prices,
he says,
or one one,
all right.

75
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:50.800
But having realized that if there are many gardens at time,
one,

76
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.540
he could figure out the relative prices.

77
00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:56.200
But if only one good at time one who's to say whether we're measuring dollars or

78
00:04:56.201 --> 00:04:58.330
Franks or sense,
we'll just call it one.

79
00:04:58.331 --> 00:04:59.980
And the same thing's going to happen next year.

80
00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:01.990
Who knows whether it's dollars or cents or francs.

81
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.070
So we're going to call it one again.
But after that,
he,
he figured everything out.

82
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.700
This turned out to be a price of a third.

83
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.860
This turned out to be a price of two thirds.

84
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.720
And we figured out all the consumption's,
uh,
which I've forgotten,
of course.

85
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.880
But anyway,
they were,

86
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.660
who knows what they were.
Not that it's still important.
Um,
all right,

87
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:31.060
well I forgot what they were.
Anyway,
he figured out all the consumptions.

88
00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:35.500
I think they were,
uh,
actually I sort of remember them.
Um,

89
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.640
well let's say I don't,
anyway,
we figured out all the consumption's.

90
00:05:40.641 --> 00:05:42.050
Does anyone remember what they were?

91
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.203
<v 1>Oh,</v>

92
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.250
<v 0>all right.
I will look them up.</v>

93
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.250
Four thirds to two thirds to,
okay,
so they were four thirds.

94
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.990
Two and two thirds and two a and two thirds and two.

95
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.040
Okay.
So he figured out an equilibrium.
And how did he do it?

96
00:06:11.041 --> 00:06:13.140
Cause he solved over here first he would have saw the,

97
00:06:13.141 --> 00:06:16.110
didn't do this exact problem but he would've solved over here and we would have

98
00:06:16.111 --> 00:06:21.111
found with p one equal to one p two equals a third and sure enough x a one

99
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.470
equals four thirds x a two equals two and x v one equals two thirds and x equals

100
00:06:31.411 --> 00:06:35.070
two.
Okay.
So Fisher said,
start with the financial economy,

101
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.030
figure out what the reduced general equilibrium is,

102
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.630
solve for this equilibrium and go back and figure out what the financial

103
00:06:42.631 --> 00:06:45.180
equilibrium should be.
All right,

104
00:06:45.181 --> 00:06:48.570
so I want to now examine what we've done and we did that at the end of last

105
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.880
class.
You had to do it in a problem set.
Okay.

106
00:06:50.881 --> 00:06:54.360
And you notice that the bay only difference between this and that is the general

107
00:06:54.361 --> 00:06:57.450
equilibrium throws away a lot of irrelevant information.

108
00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.220
Cause Fisher said people are rational.

109
00:06:59.221 --> 00:07:03.510
They look through the veil of all the Jibberish of the WHO owns the company and

110
00:07:03.511 --> 00:07:04.081
stuff like that.

111
00:07:04.081 --> 00:07:06.480
And they're just anticipating what the company's going to produce.

112
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.530
They don't really care about whether there's a man running the company or a

113
00:07:10.531 --> 00:07:14.580
woman running a company or whether she's got an Mba from Harvard or from Yale or

114
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.550
none of that's irrelevant.
You know what the business plan is,

115
00:07:17.551 --> 00:07:20.310
all they care about is what's going to actually happen in the end.

116
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.680
So if you think they're going to anticipate that correctly,

117
00:07:22.681 --> 00:07:26.880
you don't need to worry about all the other stuff.
So there's the,
uh,
um,

118
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.530
so looking through the veil,

119
00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:31.290
you can always reduce the financial equity room to a general equilibrium.

120
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.210
Now I want to go back and reexamine all that logic.
Okay.

121
00:07:36.211 --> 00:07:41.211
So what's the first step in what a Fisher did?

122
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.760
Okay.
And this is the idea.
So of uh,
no arbitrage.

123
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:54.800
It's a Fisher,
said,
people look through the veil of things,

124
00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:56.420
they understand stuff,

125
00:07:56.421 --> 00:08:00.650
and you can count their understanding to guide your understanding of the
economy.

126
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:05.830
So if you know that Pi Alpha equals this is a big pie,

127
00:08:06.441 --> 00:08:11.030
Pie Alpha equals a third.
Okay.

128
00:08:11.031 --> 00:08:12.800
So Fisher says,
well,

129
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.510
you don't have to solve for the whole equilibrium to figure out what Pi Beta is,

130
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.010
what,
what's Pi?
Beta B?

131
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:24.430
We'll Fisher would have said stock Beta always pays off exactly what stock Alpha

132
00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:28.130
pays off.
So if these people are rational,

133
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.550
they're not going to allow for an arbitrage,
then I can allow for.

134
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.310
So arbitrage means there too.
Uh,

135
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.810
assets are two things that are identical.
They have to sell for the same price.

136
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.590
That's no arbitrage.
If they did,
if they sold for a different price,

137
00:08:42.591 --> 00:08:45.590
there'd be an arbitrage and you'd sell the more expensive one and buy the

138
00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:49.440
cheaper one.
And so you'd have accomplished a perfect trade off,

139
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.250
but you'd have gotten the difference of money.
So few.

140
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.270
So since Pi Alpha's one third Pi has to equal two thirds,
hey,

141
00:08:57.271 --> 00:09:01.860
that's the first most important principle of finance.
Um,

142
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.960
that Fisher introduced the idea of no arbitrage and making deductions for no

143
00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:07.740
arbitrage.

144
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:12.210
So most of the finance is actually being more and more clever about how to do no

145
00:09:12.211 --> 00:09:15.330
arbitrage.
Over half of this course is going to be,

146
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.860
let's look at situations where,
you know,

147
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.540
at first glance there doesn't seem to be any arbitrage.

148
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.830
Then you realize if you're clever enough,
uh,

149
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.420
you'll recognize an arbitrage and be able to figure out all the prices without

150
00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:31.040
having to know all the utilities and everything else.
Okay.
So the,

151
00:09:31.041 --> 00:09:35.040
the one of the main goals of finances to explain acid prices,

152
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.610
you can see how no arbitrage is going to help do that because if you knew what

153
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.040
some of the asset prices were,
you could deduce what the rest might be.
Okay?

154
00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:48.120
So that's the first thing Fisher did and he's used this fact and connecting

155
00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:51.690
these two economies.
Okay.
So that's the first thing.

156
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:56.670
Now that principle can be used over and over again.

157
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:02.210
So let's suppose that another application of it,

158
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.560
let's suppose that we introduced

159
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:11.990
a nominal bond,

160
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.760
pay off
what,

161
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.880
$1 in period two.

162
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:31.250
And suppose as before that Q one equals Q two equals one as we've already

163
00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:39.300
suppose.
Okay.
So can we figure out,

164
00:10:39.301 --> 00:10:42.900
so then by definition the price of this bond

165
00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.680
is equal to one over one plus I where I is the nominal interest rate.

166
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.920
Okay.
Why is that?
Because you're going to get a dollar next year.

167
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:06.840
If the price is less than a dollar this year you're turning something less than

168
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.730
a dollar into something more.
The equal to a dollar.

169
00:11:08.731 --> 00:11:12.230
You're multiplying today's price by one plus I to get tomorrow's price.

170
00:11:12.231 --> 00:11:15.990
Or the rate of return is one plus I taking whatever you put in today and getting

171
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:20.660
one for side tomorrow.
So what is one plus PSI?
So,

172
00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:25.650
so by no arbitrage we can figure out what one plus I must be.

173
00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:29.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

174
00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:29.351
<v 0>Okay.</v>

175
00:11:29.351 --> 00:11:34.351
So $1 today can go into three units

176
00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:38.040
of stock Alpha,

177
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.500
<v 1>okay?</v>

178
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.570
<v 0>Which goes into three,
uh,</v>

179
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:48.630
units of x t x two as dividends.

180
00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.040
Hey,
which equals $3.

181
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.710
So you take $1 today by buying stock Alpha,
you can get three units of it.

182
00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:04.390
Since it's price is a third
and it's in stock.

183
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:09.391
Alpha pays one unit of a,

184
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.120
where is it?
One unit of output.
Next period.

185
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.320
You know that $1 today gives you three months of stock Alpha,

186
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:21.490
which gives you three units of good too is the output.
And at that price,

187
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:25.210
$1 tomorrow you've anticipated that's $3.
So by buying stock Alpha,

188
00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:27.280
you can put in a dollar and get up $3.

189
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.690
So means that one plus I is equal to three.

190
00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:37.360
Okay?
Which means the interest rate is 200%
okay?

191
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:41.260
So that's the second thing you could deduce from that.

192
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:45.280
So notice that by looking at part of the equilibrium here,

193
00:12:45.281 --> 00:12:47.800
we can figure out a lot of the rest of the equilibrium.

194
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:52.690
So what's another application?
Well,
Fisher said.

195
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.610
Define the real interest rate,

196
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.753
<v 1>right?</v>

197
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:05.310
<v 0>As trader as a,
you know,
number of goods today</v>

198
00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.070
goes into number of goods tomorrow.

199
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:13.240
<v 1>Okay?</v>

200
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:13.840
<v 0>So,</v>

201
00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.610
so this will be one plus r equals that,

202
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.900
okay,
the number of goods today and how many goods tomorrow do you get?

203
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.880
So how can you do that?
Well,

204
00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:29.881
$1 today can go into one good today.

205
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:34.180
One unit of x one

206
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.340
is $1 today,
right?

207
00:13:39.341 --> 00:13:41.230
Because you can tell if you had one apple today,

208
00:13:41.231 --> 00:13:45.400
you could sell it for Q one times one apple,
which is Q one times one,

209
00:13:45.401 --> 00:13:47.590
which is one times one,
which is $1 today,

210
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:52.060
which you can get three uh,
three shares,

211
00:13:52.061 --> 00:13:56.910
three units of stock Alpha,
which gives you,

212
00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:01.350
um,
three units of x two.

213
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:06.180
Okay?
So one unit of x one today turns into three units of x two.

214
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:11.390
So therefore one plus r equals three implies r equals 200%.

215
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.590
So that's the real rate of interest.
So Fisher said it's a,

216
00:14:16.591 --> 00:14:18.810
one of the tricks,
and going from here to here,

217
00:14:18.811 --> 00:14:21.660
it was to say that Fisher realize that people are going to look through all the

218
00:14:21.661 --> 00:14:24.510
jibberish of money and they're going to think about what apples are they giving

219
00:14:24.511 --> 00:14:27.480
up today and what apples are they getting tomorrow?
Then I can to get,
you know,

220
00:14:27.481 --> 00:14:31.080
they're not going to be confused by all the holding of assets in between.

221
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:34.400
All right,

222
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:39.080
so let's just make it a little bit more complicated for suppose.

223
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:43.670
Um,
we started with

224
00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.760
Q one equals one Q two equals two.

225
00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:56.880
<v 2>Now,
I told you that equilibrium Fisher says there's no,
you can't figure out,</v>

226
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.620
there's always a normalization.

227
00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:01.800
Vol Rasa originally had the normalization in one period.

228
00:15:01.801 --> 00:15:05.910
There was all the one period model in general equilibrium in multi period
models,

229
00:15:05.911 --> 00:15:07.470
there's a normalization.
Every period,

230
00:15:07.471 --> 00:15:10.290
every period there's a choice of where you're dealing with dollars or Franks or

231
00:15:10.291 --> 00:15:13.740
certain teams or how many.
And so there's a free normalization.

232
00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:17.120
So let's take Q one equal to one and Q two equal to two.
Well,

233
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.160
what does that mean?
That means that inflation.

234
00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.353
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

235
00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.890
<v 2>one plus,
let's call it growth of money.
Gee,
I,</v>

236
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.750
I've already used for the nominal interest rate.

237
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:33.370
So one plus g is going to be two over one or just to,
so,

238
00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:38.460
so inflation equals a 200% it equals 100%

239
00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:42.420
<v 1>100%</v>

240
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.010
<v 2>okay.
So what's Pi Alpha going to be?</v>

241
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:49.820
<v 1>Okay,</v>

242
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.880
<v 2>I've done my work now and the rest I'm going to just ask you for the rest of the</v>

243
00:15:52.881 --> 00:15:54.170
numbers.
What's Pi Alpha.

244
00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:01.150
So if I resolved meQuilibrium taking Q on equal to one and Q two equal to two,

245
00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:04.590
all that's kind of money stuff.

246
00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:06.840
So it's not going to change what happens over there.

247
00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:09.180
You're going to get the same eco living over there and you're going to go back

248
00:16:09.181 --> 00:16:11.700
to over here.
So what's Pi Alpha going to be?

249
00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:21.140
<v 1>Okay.
Uh Huh.</v>

250
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.820
<v 2>Suppose we knew we were in the same real economy.</v>

251
00:16:26.821 --> 00:16:29.820
There's nothing changed about utilities,
Endowments of Gourds,

252
00:16:29.821 --> 00:16:31.290
productivity of the stocks.

253
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.870
All we know is that inflation is going to be higher now.

254
00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:36.330
So what do you think would happen in the new equilibrium?

255
00:16:36.331 --> 00:16:38.700
What's going to happen to the price of stocks today?

256
00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:47.783
<v 1>Yes.</v>

257
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:54.150
<v 2>Price of stock Alpha.
What was it before?</v>

258
00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:56.510
<v 1>Okay,</v>

259
00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:00.480
<v 2>so what was it before one?
Yeah,
one,</v>

260
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:06.140
one third.
So it's still one third.
Okay.
So here we've got,
okay.

261
00:17:06.141 --> 00:17:11.120
This is a big mystery and finance,
you know,
big question and finance and now,

262
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.570
okay,
so you see why it's puzzling.
You didn't get the answer right off,

263
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.270
although she did,
but,
so you just have to think about it a second.

264
00:17:17.271 --> 00:17:22.190
If you really thought that people when they were buying and selling only bought

265
00:17:22.191 --> 00:17:24.320
a stock because they said to themselves,

266
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:27.350
you know how many apples am I going to get out of this stock?

267
00:17:27.351 --> 00:17:30.710
I don't care about dollars and son teams and Frank's,
I'm not going to eat that.

268
00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:32.180
I'm going to eat the apples and I'm going to,

269
00:17:32.181 --> 00:17:35.090
maybe I'll get the apples and sell them and eat pears instead.

270
00:17:35.091 --> 00:17:37.430
But I care about the,
the goods I'm going to get.

271
00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.330
So I looked through all the veil.
I should recognize that the stock,

272
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:46.010
although it's not going to pay twice as many dollars as it did before.
Okay,

273
00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:52.140
so it's going to pay $2 that's how so and guests to someone said to,
okay,

274
00:17:52.141 --> 00:17:54.780
so how did he get to,
I didn't even realize how he came up with a number two.

275
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:56.940
He came up with a number two because he said,
well,

276
00:17:56.941 --> 00:18:01.470
the stock is paying one apple tomorrow.
The price of apples is now too,

277
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:05.280
so it's paying $2 tomorrow.
So maybe it should be worth $2.

278
00:18:05.281 --> 00:18:09.150
It's priced today should be too,
but no,
that isn't how much the stock is worth.

279
00:18:09.151 --> 00:18:11.040
The stock is worth,
you know,

280
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.830
solving for this general lack Librium supply and demand.

281
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:18.090
And so the stock we already calculated before the stock was a third.

282
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.590
So the price of the stock is going to stay a third because the apples that pays

283
00:18:22.591 --> 00:18:23.970
tomorrow hasn't changed.

284
00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:26.770
<v 1>Okay.</v>

285
00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:28.150
<v 2>Still the same one apple.</v>

286
00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:32.680
Now how did we know of a stock was priced at a third before?
Well,
biff.
Okay,

287
00:18:32.681 --> 00:18:36.160
so what was the stock in general?
What's the price of the stock?

288
00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.720
Price of the stock.
Okay.

289
00:18:37.721 --> 00:18:41.410
Remember is how did we get it by going from here to here,

290
00:18:41.411 --> 00:18:46.030
we said it's going to equal the price of the stock divided by p one.

291
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:50.980
Okay.
Now the stock is only paying a certain number of goods.

292
00:18:50.981 --> 00:18:54.070
So the value of the goods today,
okay,
this is going to equal

293
00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.393
<v 1>mmm.</v>

294
00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:05.520
<v 2>Price of the stock today is going to equal the present value one over one plus r</v>

295
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.100
<v 1>times.
Um,
it's dividend.</v>

296
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.943
Okay,

297
00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.930
<v 2>well,
the price of this,
so let's just,
I'll write it this way.</v>

298
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:27.940
The price of the stock is p two times this.
Let's just write this.
Okay.

299
00:19:27.941 --> 00:19:30.110
What would Fisher say?
Fisher would say,

300
00:19:30.111 --> 00:19:33.760
how did we get the price of the stock from going from here to here?

301
00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.810
We got the price of the stock by saying,

302
00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:39.450
<v 1>okay,</v>

303
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.630
<v 2>um,
we got the price of the stock by saying</v>

304
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:48.030
the stock pays off one good tomorrow.

305
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.550
Okay,

306
00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:55.550
but one good tomorrow is only worth a third of one good today.

307
00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:01.040
So therefore the value of the stock is only equal to Ufford Times one equals one

308
00:20:02.491 --> 00:20:06.400
third.
Okay,

309
00:20:06.401 --> 00:20:08.550
so assuming [inaudible]

310
00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.760
he won equals one.

311
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:20.060
Okay.
So,

312
00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:30.490
okay,
so in terms of,
that's what Fisher would say.

313
00:20:30.491 --> 00:20:35.110
Assuming p one is one,
you figure out how many units of today's good is it worth?

314
00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:40.163
<v 1>Okay.</v>

315
00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.120
<v 2>Okay.
Now if he won isn't one,
then what do you do?</v>

316
00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:48.490
Suppose p one we're five and [inaudible] were he wanted to six let's say.

317
00:20:48.491 --> 00:20:50.470
And P two is to,
then what would you do?

318
00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:56.220
You'd have to say p one times Pi Alpha is equal to d alpha too.

319
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.220
Okay.
So if you,
if you,
uh,

320
00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.330
<v 1>okay,</v>

321
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:09.620
<v 2>multiplied all the prices by,
um,</v>

322
00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.550
am I putting the p one down to the bottom of the toffee multiplier at all the

323
00:21:13.551 --> 00:21:17.780
prices by three.
Just leave it like this.

324
00:21:17.781 --> 00:21:20.230
We'll say if Pi Alpha equals p Times d alpha took,

325
00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.160
if you measured in terms of goods,
that's how you're doing.
Now what would,
so w,

326
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.190
so if you take this,
this is also equal to

327
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:34.670
one over p one divided by p two.

328
00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:41.070
If p one is one,
assuming p one is one.

329
00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:45.180
Okay?
Times the Alpha two.
Okay.

330
00:21:45.181 --> 00:21:48.900
Which is one over one plus r times GL for two.

331
00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:55.050
Okay.
So Fisher said,
so here's his famous equation.

332
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:58.410
Fisher said the way to figure out the value of a stock,

333
00:21:58.411 --> 00:22:00.090
if you solve that problem over here,

334
00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:04.410
so look at its dividends and discount them by the real rate of interest.

335
00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:08.310
One Unit of output tomorrow.
Since the value of a,

336
00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.460
an apple tomorrow is only a third is the value of an output today.

337
00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.470
Remember the interest rate one plus R,

338
00:22:13.471 --> 00:22:17.370
the real interest rate is equal to the ratio of the two blood.

339
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.943
<v 1>Okay?</v>

340
00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:25.941
<v 2>Okay.</v>

341
00:22:25.941 --> 00:22:30.941
So p one over p two is just one plus r one plus R is p one over p two so okay,

342
00:22:32.781 --> 00:22:35.150
I'm not saying anything,
I'm saying I'm making something simple.

343
00:22:35.151 --> 00:22:38.330
The more complicated.
Sorry.
So let's just say it again.
When when we,

344
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:40.970
we solve that equilibrium over there,
we got,

345
00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:45.170
we figured out that p two is only a third of p one the price.

346
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.490
When people think today,

347
00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:49.760
how much would I give up of apples today to get an apple next year?

348
00:22:49.761 --> 00:22:53.090
They don't think Apple's next year are worth nearly as much as apples this year.

349
00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:57.380
So a third of an they'd only give up a third of an apple this year to get an

350
00:22:57.381 --> 00:23:01.460
apple next year.
P two is the amount you give up today to get an apple next year.

351
00:23:01.461 --> 00:23:05.430
So it's a third.
Another way of saying that if p one is one is that the,

352
00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.370
the real interest rate,

353
00:23:07.371 --> 00:23:10.520
the tradeoff between apples tomorrow and apples today.

354
00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:15.670
Just p one of repeat too because one apple today can give you three apples

355
00:23:15.891 --> 00:23:19.850
tomorrow.
So p one of repeat two is three.
Okay.

356
00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.500
So one plus R is three.

357
00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:26.650
So the apple tea tomorrow is worth p two times the dividend.

358
00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:31.040
That's just one over one plus r times the dividend.
Okay.
So the,

359
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:36.250
so the value of a stock is the v the real dividends.

360
00:23:36.741 --> 00:23:40.400
It's paying in the future,
discounted by the real rate of interest.

361
00:23:40.401 --> 00:23:42.650
You're turning tomorrows next year's goods,

362
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:46.010
finding the equivalent in terms of this as goods.
And

363
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.500
<v 0>the ratio of those two prices is the real rate of interest.</v>

364
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:50.540
And so that's how you would get it.

365
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:55.870
So another way of saying the same thing is you could churn cash next year into

366
00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:01.220
cash this year.
So assuming he won his one,

367
00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:08.790
another way of saying that is one over one plus I Times d alpha,

368
00:24:09.401 --> 00:24:13.270
two times Q to
face.

369
00:24:13.271 --> 00:24:15.130
You take the nominal rate of interest

370
00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:21.960
<v 2>times the money that's being produced because the nominal rate of interest says,</v>

371
00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.440
how do you trade off a dollar today for a dollar in the future?

372
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:29.400
So a dollar in the future is worth,
you know,
I'll say,
okay,

373
00:24:29.401 --> 00:24:32.780
so a dollar in the future isn't worth usually as much as a dollar today.

374
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:33.810
So you have to discount it.

375
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:37.500
So a certain number of dollars in the future is worth less dollars today.

376
00:24:37.501 --> 00:24:39.870
So you take the payoff of dollars in the future,

377
00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.970
discounted by the nominal rate of interest,

378
00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:46.110
and you get today's price or you take the real dividends in the future,

379
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:49.500
discounted by the real rate of interest and you get today's price.

380
00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:57.280
So both those things are an application of the principle of no arbitrage looking

381
00:24:57.421 --> 00:25:01.490
through the veil.
Okay.
So what would the nominal interest rate be in this case?

382
00:25:01.491 --> 00:25:04.410
In this case?
You see,
how did I know the p Alpha was still a third?

383
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:06.630
Because the real interest rate hasn't changed.

384
00:25:06.631 --> 00:25:11.631
It's still 200% so d alpha two is one and I'm still multiplying by one third,

385
00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:16.050
so I'm still getting a third for the price of Alpha.
Okay.

386
00:25:16.051 --> 00:25:20.100
So that's how she knew that the answer should stay a third cause she knew

387
00:25:20.101 --> 00:25:21.840
nothing wheel had changed in the economy.

388
00:25:21.841 --> 00:25:23.850
Therefore the real interest rate couldn't have changed.

389
00:25:23.851 --> 00:25:26.700
Therefore the price of the stock still had to be the same.

390
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:30.360
So how could we have used this formula?

391
00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.400
We have to know what the nominal interest rate is.

392
00:25:32.401 --> 00:25:35.220
So what is the nominal interest rate?
How much,

393
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:38.670
if you put in a dollar today,
how much is,

394
00:25:38.671 --> 00:25:41.610
how many dollars can you get out in the future in this new economy where there's

395
00:25:41.611 --> 00:25:42.960
100% inflation?

396
00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:46.163
<v 1>Yes.</v>

397
00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:51.520
<v 0>Okay,
so that's right.
Now how did he do that?
Because let's just do it.</v>

398
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.290
You take $1 today,

399
00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:58.760
you at Christ Q one equals one you can buy three units of Alpha still is,

400
00:26:00.191 --> 00:26:02.530
it's price is still a third okay.

401
00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:07.560
And that tells you that you get three units of x two that's the dividend of

402
00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:13.720
three lots of Alpha each.
Each share of Alpha plays one right,

403
00:26:13.721 --> 00:26:15.550
one apple and you get three apples.

404
00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:20.730
But that's equal to three times two because the price has to equal to six $6

405
00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:24.693
tomorrow.

406
00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:29.760
So you've turned $1 into $6 so one plus I equals six over one implies I equals

407
00:26:32.471 --> 00:26:35.950
500% that's exactly what he said.
Okay,

408
00:26:35.951 --> 00:26:38.620
so just say that,
you know,

409
00:26:38.621 --> 00:26:43.500
just more simply the real rate of interest.
One plus r.

410
00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:48.501
This is most famous equation Fisher ever wrote is one plus I divided by one plus

411
00:26:49.621 --> 00:26:52.770
G.
Okay,
so this is called the Fisher equation.

412
00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:57.000
Oh look to he's too famous equations for this.
It's called the Fisher equation.

413
00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.520
And this which is called the f.
These two things,
which are the same,

414
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:05.310
I called the fundamental theorem of asset pricing.

415
00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.200
Okay?
So why is this the arm true?

416
00:27:15.201 --> 00:27:19.310
The real rate of interest trades off apples today for apples tomorrow.

417
00:27:19.311 --> 00:27:21.570
All the real rate of interest,
the apples today for apples tomorrow.

418
00:27:21.571 --> 00:27:25.610
So we had one apple giving him three apples.
That's why our was 200%.

419
00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:30.980
Well,
if inflation is 100%,
so this is two.
Okay,

420
00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:34.370
one apple today gives you three apples in the future,

421
00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:39.110
but that means one apple today gives you $1 is one apple today gives you three

422
00:27:39.111 --> 00:27:43.730
apples are $6 in the future.
So that's why,
so you have to take,

423
00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:47.210
um,
so three times two.

424
00:27:47.211 --> 00:27:51.740
So if this is equal to three and inflation's 100%,
so this is equal to two,

425
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:54.980
then what's the fair rate of interest?
What will the banks give you?
Well,

426
00:27:54.981 --> 00:27:59.960
any banker can take a dollar,
buy a stock,
turned to three units of dividends,

427
00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:03.170
and then sell it for $2 a piece and get $6.

428
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.930
And so a banker can take a dollar and turn to six.

429
00:28:05.931 --> 00:28:10.460
So competition will force the bankers to give you $6 for every $1 you give it

430
00:28:10.461 --> 00:28:11.270
next period.

431
00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:16.270
So the interest rate has to be one plus I equals three times two or six.

432
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:21.020
So the real rate of interest is the nominal rate of interest divided by

433
00:28:21.021 --> 00:28:23.960
inflation.
Okay?

434
00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:28.340
And so that's one subtle,
but you know,

435
00:28:28.341 --> 00:28:29.540
once you realize it,

436
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:34.570
obvious implication of thinking people are rational and make sort of simple

437
00:28:34.581 --> 00:28:37.430
calculations,
uh,
looking at the future.

438
00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.390
And a consequence of that is the price of assets are you look at the cash that

439
00:28:41.391 --> 00:28:44.630
comes out in the future,
discounted by the nominal interest rate,

440
00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:48.560
or you look at the real goods that come out in the future and discounted by the

441
00:28:48.561 --> 00:28:53.060
real interest rate.
And it's all the same thing.
Okay.

442
00:28:53.061 --> 00:28:58.061
So does anybody know what the inflation is today or what the nominal interest

443
00:28:59.151 --> 00:29:03.020
rates are today?
So I is the nominal interest rate.

444
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.980
The amount of interest you put in the in the bank and what they'll pay you at

445
00:29:06.981 --> 00:29:10.550
the end of a year.
So we're going to next class,

446
00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:14.120
we're going to find out the exact numbers,
but what do you think it is about,

447
00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:15.500
does anyone have any idea?

448
00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:22.760
Take a wild guess as a 10% 5% yup,

449
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:30.300
usually.
And do you think it's higher or lower than usual nowadays?
It's probably.

450
00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.040
Okay,
that's good.

451
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:37.070
So let's say it's around 2% so that means this is 1.02 and what do you think

452
00:29:37.681 --> 00:29:42.180
phenomenal interest rate is now
one who said that?

453
00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:46.110
<v 2>That's a good one.
Percent okay.
That's about right.
Okay.</v>

454
00:29:46.111 --> 00:29:48.930
So what is the real rate of interest now?

455
00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:51.643
<v 1>What?</v>

456
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.620
<v 2>It's less,
well,
less than one plus r is less than one.
So,</v>

457
00:29:56.650 --> 00:30:01.650
so r one plus R is around point 99 okay.

458
00:30:02.111 --> 00:30:06.190
So the real rate of interest is actually like negative 1% how did that happen?

459
00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.940
Do you think?
It's standard to have the real interest rate be under zero.

460
00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:14.870
So why is it under zero?
What's going on now that would make that happen?

461
00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:15.853
Yup.

462
00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:17.893
<v 1>To</v>

463
00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:21.660
<v 2>Aha.
The Federal Reserve has cut the interest rate,</v>

464
00:30:21.661 --> 00:30:25.680
the nominal interest rate that it lends that to vary,
you know,
to close to zero,

465
00:30:25.681 --> 00:30:29.850
let's say to 1% on the one year bond.
Tom's zero on the three month thing.

466
00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:30.721
Okay.

467
00:30:30.721 --> 00:30:34.260
And so the reason they're saying they're doing that is to stimulate investment.

468
00:30:34.261 --> 00:30:37.890
That's what they teach you in macro Keynesian stimulate investment.

469
00:30:37.891 --> 00:30:40.470
We're going to find out that that's not the reason they're doing it at all.

470
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:43.980
The reason the Federal Reserve is cutting the interest rate Donald zero is to

471
00:30:43.981 --> 00:30:47.160
just give money away to the banks.
And why is that?
Well,

472
00:30:47.161 --> 00:30:49.290
when you put your money and deposit it in the bank,

473
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:53.100
you're getting almost no interest.
So the banks,
the big banks are,

474
00:30:53.101 --> 00:30:56.220
I've got all these deposits and people,
you know,
they don't change what they do.

475
00:30:56.221 --> 00:30:58.680
They just leave their money in the banks getting no interest.

476
00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:02.880
So the banks have the money for free and they can make money with it.

477
00:31:02.881 --> 00:31:04.350
And so they're normally,

478
00:31:04.351 --> 00:31:07.680
they'd have to pay 3% interest or something and that would be expensive for
them.

479
00:31:07.681 --> 00:31:10.380
And they had,
well,
you know,
that expense is a big part of their expenses.

480
00:31:10.381 --> 00:31:13.110
They don't have it anymore.
Okay.
So we're going to come back to that.

481
00:31:13.111 --> 00:31:15.540
What's really going on today,
but that's what's going on.
But anyway,

482
00:31:15.541 --> 00:31:19.800
the point is the nominal interest rate is somehow controlled by the Fed.

483
00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.420
That's why we don't have a theory of it.

484
00:31:21.421 --> 00:31:23.100
We're not going to do macro in this course.

485
00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.700
So Fisher doesn't have a theory of the nominal interest rate,
you know,

486
00:31:26.701 --> 00:31:28.590
of inflation.
But he does tell you,

487
00:31:28.591 --> 00:31:32.280
given inflation and the nominal inflation in the normal interest rate,

488
00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.830
that's determining a real interest rate.
Okay.

489
00:31:34.831 --> 00:31:37.830
And people should look through that.
So now they should say,

490
00:31:37.831 --> 00:31:39.150
this is sort of a Keynesian part.

491
00:31:39.151 --> 00:31:43.380
They should realize that actually an apple today,

492
00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:47.250
you know,
uh,
you know,
if you just sort of put in the bank,

493
00:31:47.251 --> 00:31:49.860
you get less than an apple in the future.

494
00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.220
So you should spend it and do something with it.
That's the Keynesian idea.

495
00:31:53.221 --> 00:31:56.520
So people,
you know,
why fritter away part of your apple do something with it.

496
00:31:56.521 --> 00:32:00.030
That's why it's supposed to stimulate demand and activity today.
Okay?

497
00:32:00.031 --> 00:32:04.080
So the point is that's how you calculate the real rate of interest and by,

498
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:08.280
you know,
shockingly,
it's a negative and it's hardly ever a negative,

499
00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:12.870
but it can be negative.
Okay.
There any questions about this?

500
00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:18.010
No arbitrage business.
All right.
So,

501
00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:20.643
um,

502
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:30.583
<v 1>okay.</v>

503
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:33.533
<v 2>Okay.</v>

504
00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:39.030
So let's do one more uh,
trick here.

505
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:43.160
Fisher thing.
Suppose that a new,
um,

506
00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.510
so let's go back to the equilibrium with Q one.

507
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.010
If you want equal one and Q two equal one.

508
00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:59.260
Suppose,
uh,
suppose China

509
00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.310
offered to

510
00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:08.650
when money lenders dollars at a 0% interest,

511
00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.840
would that be a great deal?

512
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:14.263
<v 1>Okay.</v>

513
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.680
<v 2>When people rush to do that,</v>

514
00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:27.210
this is the equilibrium we solved over here already.

515
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.290
So it was not a great deal.
Would that upset the equilibrium?

516
00:33:33.291 --> 00:33:37.250
What anyone bothered to take the Chinese deal?
If they lent at 0% interest,

517
00:33:37.251 --> 00:33:38.360
they were offering to do that?

518
00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.300
<v 1>What?
No,</v>

519
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:51.270
<v 2>they wouldn't take it.</v>

520
00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.420
<v 1>Okay,</v>

521
00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:58.320
<v 2>we're back here.
What's the nominal interest rate in this economy?</v>

522
00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:01.440
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

523
00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:05.600
<v 2>200% interest.
So if you want to borrow in this economy from another American,</v>

524
00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:08.160
you have to give the guy 200% interest here.

525
00:34:08.161 --> 00:34:11.790
The Chinese are offering to lend you at 0% interest.
So of course.
So yes,

526
00:34:11.791 --> 00:34:15.060
everyone would rush to take the thing and a okay.

527
00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:17.550
And that would have a big effect.
And what the Echo livering was,

528
00:34:17.551 --> 00:34:21.810
if the Chinese were willing to lend money,
it's such a low rate of interest.
Okay,

529
00:34:21.811 --> 00:34:25.290
let's try another question.
Suppose you could turn.

530
00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:28.980
Suppose you invented a technology,
new technology,

531
00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:37.250
new technology churns one unit,

532
00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:43.330
one apple today into two apples tomorrow.

533
00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.630
Is this something people would rush to do or not?

534
00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:54.670
Suppose someone inventor figured out how to do that.
Would he rushed to do it?

535
00:34:54.671 --> 00:34:58.150
Could it be used to help the economy?
So let's put it this way,

536
00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:00.100
could this new technology,

537
00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:04.280
new technology

538
00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:12.150
we used to make a parade.
Oh,

539
00:35:12.151 --> 00:35:15.630
improvement.
Everybody better off.

540
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:22.783
<v 1>Yup.</v>

541
00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:38.070
<v 2>Okay.
So that's exactly</v>

542
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:41.820
<v 1>the right answer.
The answer is actually you're answering two questions.</v>

543
00:35:41.821 --> 00:35:43.470
I asked two questions.
One is,

544
00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:46.950
could it be used to help the economy make everybody better?
Off,

545
00:35:46.951 --> 00:35:51.120
if a social planner was in charge of things and the Chinese invented this new

546
00:35:51.121 --> 00:35:55.410
technology or some American and Alaska invented this new technology,

547
00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:58.240
you know,
should the government,
uh,

548
00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:02.100
use the technology and couldn't use the technology to make everybody better off

549
00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:06.060
the answer to that is no.
And then the answer to a second question is,

550
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:08.520
suppose the guy in Alaska discovered himself,
he didn't,

551
00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:12.570
couldn't care less about the Pareto improvement and helping other guys and the

552
00:36:12.571 --> 00:36:16.470
American planners or anything.
He just wanted to make a profit for himself.

553
00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:21.690
Would he make a profit?
The answer is no because the,
you know,

554
00:36:21.691 --> 00:36:26.670
the real prices Fisher would say,
or one and a third.
Okay.
And,
and this would,

555
00:36:26.671 --> 00:36:29.450
uh,
you know,
no matter how you look at it,
the interest rate is 200.
The Re,

556
00:36:29.451 --> 00:36:29.900
you know,
he,

557
00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:33.570
he's losing money cause he's giving something up that's worth one and he's

558
00:36:33.571 --> 00:36:36.420
getting something that's only worth the two thirds.

559
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.760
So He'd be losing money to do it.
He'd lose money.

560
00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:43.710
So we could prove that even.
Okay.
So,

561
00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.230
so the answer is no,
that's the first question.

562
00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:52.590
And nobody would do it anyway and fortunately

563
00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:59.490
nobody would choose to do it.
Choose to use it,

564
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.230
use it because it loses money.

565
00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:12.010
<v 2>Okay,
so those are two separate questions.
You know,</v>

566
00:37:12.011 --> 00:37:16.060
could it be used and would anyone choose any individual choose to do it?

567
00:37:16.061 --> 00:37:18.880
Would it be good for the society when an individual choose to do it?

568
00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:23.590
The is happened to agree here,
so why can't it be used as a prey to improvement?

569
00:37:23.591 --> 00:37:23.980
What's the

570
00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:28.450
<v 0>proof?
What's the proof of this that it can't be,
the answer is no.</v>

571
00:37:28.451 --> 00:37:31.810
What's the proof?
Well,

572
00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:36.880
the proof is that if it did,
if in the end

573
00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:41.890
and it led to an allocation

574
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.910
x hat,
a one,

575
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:53.330
let's call it x twilled to lay one x two it'll a two next to it will be one x

576
00:37:55.410 --> 00:38:00.330
two it'll be two
that made everyone better off.

577
00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:04.973
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

578
00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:06.570
<v 0>Okay man.</v>

579
00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:11.810
Well we give their old proof then what it means that p one x twiddle a one plus

580
00:38:12.841 --> 00:38:17.430
p two x twiddle eight two is bigger than what he won.

581
00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:21.960
He had a one right?
That's what you have in the Fisher economy.

582
00:38:21.961 --> 00:38:26.961
Plus p two he had a two and similarly he won x twiddle B one plus p two x

583
00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:35.410
twiddle bead to bigger than p one.
He

584
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.990
<v 2>had the one</v>

585
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:44.740
plus p to be happy to.
Okay,

586
00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:49.000
so why is that?
Because in this fissure economy,

587
00:38:49.001 --> 00:38:50.170
the general equilibrium,

588
00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:54.370
if this allocation really made a better off than what he's gotten than four

589
00:38:54.371 --> 00:38:58.570
thirds and two,
he would have chosen it and she would be,

590
00:38:58.571 --> 00:39:02.020
she would have chosen her thing if it was better than two thirds and two.

591
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:05.260
So clearly there must have been too expensive for those two to choose cause they

592
00:39:05.261 --> 00:39:08.110
were rationally choosing the right thing,
given what they could afford.

593
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:10.270
So then you just add the stuff up

594
00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:15.970
ad and you find that total consumption.
Yeah,

595
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:19.250
<v 1>value.
Value.</v>

596
00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:22.380
<v 2>It's bigger than total endowment value.</v>

597
00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:29.900
Hey,
that's in the Fisher economy.
But we've changed the Fisher economy.

598
00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:31.071
Okay.

599
00:39:31.071 --> 00:39:34.700
Because now we've added this technology which took out away some of the first

600
00:39:34.701 --> 00:39:38.270
good and made it into the second cord.
But that technology is just lost money,

601
00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:41.810
which is bigger than total value.

602
00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:43.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

603
00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:46.080
<v 2>In new technology economy.</v>

604
00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:51.950
All right,
so let me just say this.

605
00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.790
And so that's a contradiction because the consumption of this,
however,

606
00:39:55.791 --> 00:39:57.710
the new technology got used in the end,

607
00:39:57.711 --> 00:40:01.280
the total consumption of the people had to be the total of what there was and

608
00:40:01.281 --> 00:40:02.690
what was produced in the economy.

609
00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:07.400
The value after the new technology is introduced in that new economy has only

610
00:40:07.401 --> 00:40:11.870
gone down compared to the Fisher economy and the Fisher economy value of

611
00:40:11.871 --> 00:40:15.500
endowments must have been less than this brilliant new allocation.

612
00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:19.220
And that's a contradiction because there's new allocation has to add up to the

613
00:40:19.221 --> 00:40:22.820
stuff that's there and the new technology economy.
Okay?

614
00:40:22.821 --> 00:40:27.770
So that's how we know that no new technology could possibly make everybody

615
00:40:27.771 --> 00:40:31.430
better off.
And we know trivially that if it loses,
okay,
it may,

616
00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:35.930
it makes everyone better off if and only if it makes a profit.

617
00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:40.190
So if and only if it makes a profit,
can it be used to make everybody better off?

618
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.760
And Amazingly,
in a free market economy,

619
00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:46.760
people are gonna use it if and only if it makes a profit.

620
00:40:46.761 --> 00:40:49.700
So they're gonna use it if and only if it's a good thing for the economy.

621
00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:53.450
So that's the basic laissez faire argument,

622
00:40:53.451 --> 00:40:55.610
that there are new discoveries all the time.

623
00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:58.850
Every other day somebody is thinking of something new.
Are we gonna?

624
00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.520
Are we gonna use it?
Should we use it as,

625
00:41:00.521 --> 00:41:03.470
as something we need to read about in the papers and use?
Well,

626
00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.520
there are a whole bunch of people,
the discover is themselves.

627
00:41:07.521 --> 00:41:09.920
They're going to talk to their business friends and they're going to say,

628
00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:12.560
you know,
do you want to lend me the money to get this thing going?

629
00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.140
And all of them are going to do this profit calculation.

630
00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:18.140
If they decide it loses money,
they're not going to do it.

631
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:21.800
And thank God for that because it couldn't have helped everybody if they did use

632
00:41:21.801 --> 00:41:24.950
it.
So that's the main lesson of laissez faire.

633
00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:30.020
So let me just put this in perspective a little bit.

634
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:35.230
In the old Russian economy of the 1930s and forties there was no profit system.

635
00:41:36.951 --> 00:41:41.720
So the central planner had to figure out should a new invention be used or not.

636
00:41:41.721 --> 00:41:43.250
So every time there's a new invention,

637
00:41:43.251 --> 00:41:46.490
a committee had to get together a central planners and decide whether to use it

638
00:41:46.491 --> 00:41:47.180
or not.

639
00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:51.140
And there was a famous guy named overage who was in charge of a lot of that.

640
00:41:51.141 --> 00:41:54.230
He won the Nobel Prize in economics.

641
00:41:54.231 --> 00:41:56.600
He shared it with a Yale economist named coupons.

642
00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:00.290
And so cantor overage told this very amusing story.

643
00:42:00.291 --> 00:42:02.690
He said that there were two central planning bureaus.

644
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:06.200
One was in charge of allocations and one was in charge of prices.

645
00:42:06.201 --> 00:42:08.870
One had to set the prices,
the other had to set the allocations.

646
00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:12.320
And of course the whole message here is that you have to combine these,

647
00:42:12.321 --> 00:42:16.520
you don't know whether it's worthwhile to change the allocation until you know

648
00:42:16.521 --> 00:42:18.830
whether the new technology is going to make a profit or not.

649
00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:20.830
And here they had the two things separated.

650
00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.810
They were telling people what to do before knowing whether they made a profit or

651
00:42:23.811 --> 00:42:27.380
not.
Cause they didn't have prices because they weren't free markets.
But anyway,

652
00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:28.850
so,
okay,

653
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:34.030
so the bottom line of the Fisher story is that you take this complicated

654
00:42:34.131 --> 00:42:35.330
financial economy,

655
00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:39.080
you reduce it to something very simple that you learn how to do in your freshman

656
00:42:39.081 --> 00:42:41.390
year or your sophomore year.
Solve that.

657
00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:44.990
And you go back to this and you can understand a lot about this economy.

658
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.980
That's something that most people didn't realize at the time and still don't

659
00:42:48.981 --> 00:42:52.220
realize now.
So you ask a typical person if there's inflation,

660
00:42:52.221 --> 00:42:53.990
that means the value of the stock is going to be,

661
00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.330
the dividends next year is going to be higher.

662
00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:59.960
Is that going to raise the value of the stock today?
Just like he said?
Yes,

663
00:42:59.961 --> 00:43:00.441
of course.

664
00:43:00.441 --> 00:43:05.000
Cause it makes the price of the dividends higher tomorrow Fisher would say no,

665
00:43:05.001 --> 00:43:08.600
it doesn't change anything.
Wheel on the economy.
If there's more inflation,

666
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:10.880
there'll be a higher nominal interest rate.

667
00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:15.230
So the discounted by the higher interest rate payoffs of the stock will give you

668
00:43:15.231 --> 00:43:19.340
the same stock prices before.
Okay.
So are there,

669
00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:24.050
so we're going to do a thousand app,
uh,
examples of this,

670
00:43:24.051 --> 00:43:26.270
but are there any questions about this?
Yes.

671
00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:29.693
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

672
00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:33.410
<v 2>yeah.
Sorry.
I don't know if this is in the way,
by the way.</v>

673
00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:40.400
Okay,
so this is the argument we gave a few classes ago.
I forgot when we said,

674
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:45.430
how do you know that a final allocation that is a competitive equilibrium is

675
00:43:45.951 --> 00:43:49.760
prayed or efficient and the argument was if you can do better,

676
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:53.210
that means make everybody better off then they each person,

677
00:43:53.211 --> 00:43:56.450
if you look at the value of what they're getting under the new regime,

678
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:58.730
it must be more than the value of their endowments.

679
00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:02.300
Otherwise they would've chosen the new regime and nobody chose it.

680
00:44:02.301 --> 00:44:07.301
That means everybody would have had to pay more for this new regime allocation.

681
00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:12.080
Then the value of their endowments.
Okay,
so this is more than that.

682
00:44:12.081 --> 00:44:16.430
For person a and person B's consumption is more than the value of his endowments

683
00:44:16.431 --> 00:44:21.230
is extended endowments and the Fisher thing under this new regime than the value

684
00:44:21.231 --> 00:44:24.050
of his endowments.
You're following that.
Okay.

685
00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:29.090
Then the next step was to add all this up.
Okay.
Now notice in the file,
however,

686
00:44:29.091 --> 00:44:31.860
the new technology affects the world.

687
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.860
Obviously people can only eat what's being produced.

688
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:38.330
Everything that's being produced is part of somebodies endowments.

689
00:44:38.331 --> 00:44:41.790
So if the new technology,
you know of Mr a invents the new technology,

690
00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:46.290
he gives up some of his good at time one to get more of the good at time two.

691
00:44:46.291 --> 00:44:49.230
So his endowment has changed,
but he's got a new endowment,

692
00:44:49.231 --> 00:44:52.710
but it's still his endowment.
So whatever the new allocation is,

693
00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.720
it has to add up to the new endowment.
Now,

694
00:44:54.721 --> 00:44:56.940
I haven't even bothered to write down the new endowment,

695
00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:01.110
but I know the value of that new endowment,
whatever it is,

696
00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:04.830
is going to be less than the value of the old endowment because the new

697
00:45:04.831 --> 00:45:08.040
technology loses money.
Okay.

698
00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:13.130
So the contradiction is the value of the new endowment after the technology is

699
00:45:13.921 --> 00:45:18.921
used at the old equilibrium prices is lower than the value of the old endowment

700
00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.210
at the old equilibrium prices.

701
00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:25.230
But that since it's true for every person in the aggregate,

702
00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:29.070
that's less than the value of this new regime consumption.

703
00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:33.060
And that's a contradiction because the new regime consumption,

704
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:38.510
that's all this stuff has to equal exactly the total endowments in the economy

705
00:45:38.521 --> 00:45:41.520
to begin with.
And that's the contradiction.
Okay?

706
00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:46.060
So you can't make everybody better off that simple argument,
which as I said,
uh,

707
00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:50.550
my advisor,
Ken Arrow,
another guy at Yale named Gerard Debreu,

708
00:45:50.551 --> 00:45:53.430
both of them were working at the Coles Foundation,
which was part of Yale.

709
00:45:53.431 --> 00:45:56.130
That proof that they gave is most important,

710
00:45:56.610 --> 00:46:00.030
simplest and most important argument and all of economics.
Okay?

711
00:46:00.031 --> 00:46:05.031
So we get as a conclusion that putting it another way that um,

712
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:11.370
owners,
owners of owners of firms

713
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:14.103
<v 1>should</v>

714
00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:16.360
<v 2>maximized.</v>

715
00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:17.693
<v 1>Okay.</v>

716
00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:23.140
<v 2>Share the value of their firms,
the value of the stock market,
value</v>

717
00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.430
<v 1>value of their firms.</v>

718
00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:36.200
<v 2>And thank God they do.</v>

719
00:46:36.201 --> 00:46:40.220
Because if they find some new way of producing that's going to lose money,

720
00:46:40.221 --> 00:46:42.260
it's gonna make the stock market value go down.

721
00:46:42.261 --> 00:46:45.200
Remember the stock market value is just the same calculation,

722
00:46:45.201 --> 00:46:47.060
the value of all the output they're producing.

723
00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:50.300
If they find some way of losing money and they try to use it,

724
00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:52.400
it'll make their stock market value go down.

725
00:46:52.401 --> 00:46:53.630
That's why they're not going to do it.

726
00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:57.980
And that thank God for that because it'd be a bad thing for society if they did

727
00:46:57.981 --> 00:46:58.814
do it.

728
00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:00.903
<v 1>Yes.</v>

729
00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:09.860
Knowledge the price.
So let them change might not be true.

730
00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.200
I'll change it.

731
00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:21.120
<v 2>Okay.
It was a very bold question telling me that as a flood proof,</v>

732
00:47:21.121 --> 00:47:24.990
I'm want to commend you for your courage,
um,

733
00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:27.530
as it happens.
However,
uh,

734
00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:31.360
you've asked the same question that somebody asked a class or two,

735
00:47:31.361 --> 00:47:35.290
which is a very good question.
Uh,
so the answer is no,

736
00:47:35.291 --> 00:47:39.040
I shouldn't have changed the prices.
And that's exactly the point of the proof.

737
00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:43.840
So yes,
it's true that after the new technology is introduced,

738
00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.600
the prices change,
everything changes.

739
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:50.920
But we don't have to worry about all that complication.
After all the changes,

740
00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:55.090
there's going to be some final allocation of goods that supposedly makes

741
00:47:55.091 --> 00:47:58.690
everybody better off.
So I can ask the hypothetical question,

742
00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:01.840
would this new allocation to a,

743
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:06.610
at the old prices be something he could have afforded?
And the answer must be no.

744
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:09.520
Well,
let me just finish.
So you're,
you're see the answer to your question,

745
00:48:09.521 --> 00:48:12.580
but I'm going to say it out cause a very important question.
So at the,

746
00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:17.100
so the proof is clever precisely because of what your asking you.

747
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:19.210
You have to do something that you wouldn't have thought of.

748
00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:23.140
You have this new economy and new allocation,
a new prices,

749
00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:25.120
but the proof says,

750
00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:29.080
let's do the hypothetical up thing of looking at the new allocation at the old

751
00:48:29.081 --> 00:48:31.720
prices,
at the old prices.

752
00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:36.640
Peep a couldn't have afforded this new allocation that because if he could have,

753
00:48:36.641 --> 00:48:40.150
he would have bought it because it makes them better off.
So at the old prices,

754
00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:44.950
a couldn't have afforded this new regime allocation similarly be at the old

755
00:48:44.951 --> 00:48:48.760
prices,
couldn't afford this new regime allocation.
Okay,

756
00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:50.950
so at the old prices,

757
00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:54.580
everybody would have to be spending more on the numerous team allocation than

758
00:48:54.581 --> 00:48:57.730
the value of their endowment.
That means that the old prices,

759
00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:00.040
the total and the whole society,

760
00:49:00.041 --> 00:49:03.730
by adding it up of the expenditures on the new regime,

761
00:49:03.731 --> 00:49:08.731
consumption's must be bigger than the total value of the old endowments.

762
00:49:09.370 --> 00:49:12.520
Now,
that was the contradiction.
Why at the old endowments without production,

763
00:49:12.521 --> 00:49:15.460
you couldn't make everybody better off.
We'd already have a contradiction.

764
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:17.050
Now we add one more step.

765
00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:21.760
We've got this new technology that changed the old equilibrium endowment,

766
00:49:21.790 --> 00:49:23.980
the old endowments.
It changed the old endowments.

767
00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:26.860
But however it changed that we don't have to keep track of how it did it.

768
00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:30.220
It made the value of the total endowments even last than it was before.

769
00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:33.460
So we actually get a worse contradiction than before.
So it was a good question.

770
00:49:33.461 --> 00:49:37.840
So I thank you for the question.
Okay.

771
00:49:37.841 --> 00:49:38.830
Any other questions?

772
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:41.303
<v 1>Yes,</v>

773
00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:46.810
<v 2>yes,
I can raise which board?
Not this one.
Yeah.
Well,</v>

774
00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:49.593
sorry.

775
00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:51.560
<v 1>Okay.</v>

776
00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:52.393
<v 2>Okay.</v>

777
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:57.170
So the bottom line here is that,

778
00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:00.980
let me just summarize.
We've spent,
you know,

779
00:50:00.981 --> 00:50:05.960
four classes on reviewing standard,
intermediate,
micro and macro.

780
00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:11.170
People never talk about that stuff when they do financial finance courses and

781
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:15.980
typical courses.
However,
Irving Fisher,
the inventor of half of finance,

782
00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.470
that's how he began.
And it's going to turn out now,

783
00:50:18.471 --> 00:50:20.660
especially in light of this last crisis,

784
00:50:20.661 --> 00:50:24.590
that the best way to understand what's going on is to go back to the original

785
00:50:24.591 --> 00:50:28.640
underlying economy.
So Fisher said you can always,
we haven't introduced risk,

786
00:50:28.641 --> 00:50:31.100
by the way,
when that happens,
things are gonna get more complicated.

787
00:50:31.101 --> 00:50:34.070
Fisher couldn't deal with risks.
So without risk,

788
00:50:34.071 --> 00:50:36.920
where everybody's anticipating the dividends in the future,

789
00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:41.720
that means that you can always reduce a financial economy up there to a general

790
00:50:41.721 --> 00:50:45.290
equilibrium which you've been taught before.
You got to this course,

791
00:50:45.291 --> 00:50:46.640
most of you how to solve.

792
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.140
And now that solution to that problem with margin utility and pray to
efficiency,

793
00:50:51.141 --> 00:50:55.400
that tells us an enormous amount about how the stock market and everything
works.

794
00:50:55.580 --> 00:51:00.580
It tells us that the value of every stock is just the discounted real dividends

795
00:51:00.681 --> 00:51:05.681
discounted at the real rate of interest or the discounted nominal payoffs.

796
00:51:05.991 --> 00:51:09.200
Cash flows discounted at the nominal rate of interest.

797
00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:14.000
And it tells us that the real rate of interest is the nominal rate divided by

798
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:18.140
the rate of inflation.
Okay?
And it tells us that it's a good thing.

799
00:51:18.141 --> 00:51:21.710
All these owners of companies or maximizing profits are shared value,

800
00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:25.640
which is the same thing.
And that's helping society.
Okay,

801
00:51:25.641 --> 00:51:27.740
so that's the Fisher.
That's the lesson.

802
00:51:27.741 --> 00:51:31.580
A lot of that stuff is going to change a little bit,
but that's the basic idea.

803
00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:34.790
So finally,
let's get to the point though,

804
00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:37.340
the for 2000 years,

805
00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:42.350
the public was confused about interest.
They said Aristotle,
you know,

806
00:51:42.351 --> 00:51:43.880
one of the greatest geniuses of all time.

807
00:51:43.881 --> 00:51:48.050
He thought interests was an unnatural act.
It was horrible.
Okay.

808
00:51:48.051 --> 00:51:50.060
Even though of course,
every lots of people in Greece,

809
00:51:50.061 --> 00:51:53.550
we're charging interest in the,
you know,
the,
the,
the de Los,

810
00:51:53.551 --> 00:51:56.840
the of the Delphic oracle was charging interest,

811
00:51:56.841 --> 00:51:59.180
would lend money at interests and you know,
at Aristotle,

812
00:51:59.181 --> 00:52:01.300
and everybody was talking about the Delphic oracle all the time.

813
00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:02.320
They weren't even paying attention.

814
00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:04.850
The Delphic oracle was charging interest and they were saying it's totally

815
00:52:04.851 --> 00:52:07.220
unnatural.
Okay.
So,
um,

816
00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:10.820
three religions all thought interest was a terrible thing.

817
00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:14.000
They all thought that it was,
you know,
there should be,
the just price was,

818
00:52:14.001 --> 00:52:15.710
the nominal rate of interest should be zero.

819
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:18.920
But what Fisher says is the nominal rate of interest is irrelevant.

820
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:21.470
Nobody cares about the nominal rate of interest.

821
00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:24.410
They look at Apple's today and Apple's next year,

822
00:52:24.411 --> 00:52:26.270
the money and stuff just gets in the way.

823
00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:28.940
It's the real rate of interest that you care about.

824
00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:32.900
And the real rate of interest doesn't have to be positive.

825
00:52:32.901 --> 00:52:37.430
It could be negative like it is today.
But the real rate of interest,
um,

826
00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:40.460
he says is the real rate of interest.

827
00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:43.970
What are the determinants usually of the real rate of interest if the Federal

828
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:45.440
Reserve isn't mucking around with things,

829
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:50.390
the real rate of interest is obtained by solving for p one and p two in this

830
00:52:50.391 --> 00:52:54.980
general equilibrium model.
Okay,
so what would change the real rate of interest?

831
00:52:56.540 --> 00:53:01.430
All you have are the utilities and the endowments.
Okay,
so here's the economy.

832
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:03.470
What would change the real rate of interest?

833
00:53:03.471 --> 00:53:06.350
So the first thing Fisher says is impatience.

834
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:12.050
So in fact is one of his most famous article is called an impatience theory of

835
00:53:12.051 --> 00:53:15.650
interest.
So let's call it that.
Patients theory of interest.

836
00:53:16.550 --> 00:53:21.290
So Fisher said that in his view,
people are impatient.
Why?

837
00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:24.770
That means an apple today they thought was more valuable than an apple next year

838
00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:26.010
because

839
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:28.320
<v 0>of the poor imagination.</v>

840
00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:34.190
I was easy to think about eating the apple today.
We're going get it.

841
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:36.330
Just hold it in your hand and you're,
it's so close.

842
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:39.600
But to think about eating it in a year requires some imagination.

843
00:53:39.601 --> 00:53:43.830
They had poor imagination.
And secondly,
the second main reason is they,
you know,

844
00:53:43.831 --> 00:53:47.910
they mortality,
they might die between today and next year.

845
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:53.570
Okay.
So those are the two main reasons.
He gives a bunch of others,

846
00:53:53.571 --> 00:53:56.540
which I'm going to mention shortly,
but these are the two most interesting ones.

847
00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:59.900
Poverty of imagination and the fact that you just might die in between.

848
00:53:59.901 --> 00:54:03.380
So what does it mean to say an apple next year?
It's not a sure thing.
Okay.

849
00:54:03.381 --> 00:54:04.910
There's some theory of interest.

850
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:10.270
So he said that's why it makes sense to have this guy a is impatient because he

851
00:54:11.841 --> 00:54:16.760
values the apple today more than a value tomorrow he's got this discount rate a

852
00:54:16.761 --> 00:54:21.200
half here.
B's not impatient because the discount factor is one.

853
00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.080
Okay.
So he put a discount factor.

854
00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:30.000
Actually Fisher didn't quite have a discount faction in a more general thing.

855
00:54:30.001 --> 00:54:34.230
So Sam Wilson was the one who introduced the discount factor.

856
00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:36.480
Doesn't matter.
But anyway,

857
00:54:36.481 --> 00:54:40.200
so it does count fact and to capture Fisher's idea that the good next year,

858
00:54:40.201 --> 00:54:44.490
it's not as worth the same apple next year is not worth as much to a is an apple

859
00:54:44.491 --> 00:54:45.600
this year.
Okay.

860
00:54:45.601 --> 00:54:49.800
So suppose I change a half to a third,

861
00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:54.120
what will happen to the real rate of interest?

862
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:58.070
So more so that makes people more impatient?

863
00:54:58.520 --> 00:54:59.353
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

864
00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:04.060
<v 0>Why does it make them more impatient?</v>

865
00:55:04.061 --> 00:55:08.530
Because now they care even less about the good next year.
More impatient implies,

866
00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:12.910
all right,
so when did this happen?
And the Reagan years,
the now generation,

867
00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:17.410
everybody talked about the,
now generation people are getting more impatient.

868
00:55:17.411 --> 00:55:18.244
They want,
you know,

869
00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:22.690
so what happens to the wheel rate of interest when people get more impatient?

870
00:55:22.691 --> 00:55:23.830
Does it go up or down?

871
00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:25.633
<v 1>Yup.</v>

872
00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:29.000
<v 0>Okay.
So why does it go up?
That's correct.</v>

873
00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:38.380
Right.
Okay.
But now Fisher would say that a little bit more.

874
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:43.780
Fisher would say that a little bit more.
Um,
it would say a little more formally,

875
00:55:43.781 --> 00:55:46.900
but that's exactly right.
So if people care,
they don't,

876
00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:49.930
in order to get anybody to save because they want the stuff.

877
00:55:49.931 --> 00:55:51.970
Now you're gonna have to give them a higher real rate of interest.

878
00:55:51.971 --> 00:55:55.420
That's exactly right.
So how could you say it in this economy,

879
00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:59.710
remembering this economy,
this Cobb Douglas economy.
You could prove it formally.

880
00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:01.900
You know that if p two,

881
00:56:01.901 --> 00:56:06.901
let's say equals one and we're solving for p one and here's the supply is x one,

882
00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:14.070
and here's demand.
So remember x one,

883
00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:17.080
you know a is going to be something like uh,

884
00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:19.720
a loss.

885
00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:25.500
It's p one plus p a a two times,

886
00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:32.260
uh,
you know one,
oh,
sorry.
Let's make this better.

887
00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:37.150
X a one equals one over one plus Delta were Delta,

888
00:56:37.151 --> 00:56:41.650
what's called Delta,
the discount.
Call this delta.
Okay,

889
00:56:41.651 --> 00:56:45.910
so the discount,
so right to get these,
to add up to one,

890
00:56:45.911 --> 00:56:47.410
I take one plus delta.

891
00:56:47.411 --> 00:56:51.730
So the weight on this thing is one over one plus Delta Times this divided by p

892
00:56:51.731 --> 00:56:54.370
one.
So p one is one,

893
00:56:56.190 --> 00:57:00.980
a p two was one,
okay?
Then,
uh,

894
00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:06.920
this is just equal to one over one plus Delta Times ea one plus one over p two

895
00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:13.750
times.
Hey,
so clearly with the same day.

896
00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:17.040
So clearly the demand goes down as p one goes [inaudible].

897
00:57:17.610 --> 00:57:21.360
This is a p one is p p two equals one.

898
00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:25.800
So if I divide by p one p one over p one goes away and then I have p two over p

899
00:57:25.801 --> 00:57:30.420
one and p two is one that's just one of p one.
So obviously as p one goes up,

900
00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:34.500
your demand goes down.
That's just what you'd expect.
So p one goes up,

901
00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:38.910
one goes down,
the demand goes up,
or p one goes up,
the demand goes down.

902
00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:43.320
So to prove,
so that's anyway,
if you add up car Douglas people,

903
00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:48.420
it always is like that.
The demand for any good goes up as the price goes down,

904
00:57:48.421 --> 00:57:51.390
if its own price goes down.
So if you change Delta,

905
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:54.300
if you make Delta smaller,

906
00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:59.310
that's going to raise demand for a one at the old prices.
Why?

907
00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:03.330
At old equilibrium prices,

908
00:58:03.331 --> 00:58:07.530
the same trick is before and old equilibrium prices.

909
00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:12.330
What's going to happen?
Delta goes,
um,

910
00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:17.960
down like we just said implies x a Wa x,

911
00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:23.130
a one goes up.
Okay,
so there's the guys demanding more now.

912
00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:29.590
Okay.
But if he's dating,
demanding more at the old equilibrium prices,

913
00:58:32.570 --> 00:58:33.403
<v 1>hey,
he's done.</v>

914
00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:38.890
<v 0>Okay.
So the old equilibrium prices,
he's demanding more.</v>

915
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:43.950
So the only way to clear the market as to raise p one implies p one must go up

916
00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:49.960
to clear the market.
Okay,
so this is a formal proof of what he just said.

917
00:58:49.961 --> 00:58:51.850
So the common sense maybe is enough for you.

918
00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:55.480
If you care less about the future to get anybody to save,

919
00:58:55.481 --> 00:58:58.340
you're going to have to raise the interest rate to say it formally.
If you,

920
00:58:58.341 --> 00:59:03.341
we saw for equilibrium with a lower delta at the old equilibrium prices,

921
00:59:03.550 --> 00:59:08.050
this guy at the old prices a wood now shift and by trying to demand more of good

922
00:59:08.051 --> 00:59:10.600
one,
but if he demanded more of good one,

923
00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:12.910
that would mean too much demand for good one.

924
00:59:12.911 --> 00:59:16.540
And the only way to clear the price of good one is to raise the price p one.

925
00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:19.030
But if he raised [inaudible] holding p two fixed,

926
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:22.160
that's just pee wanna repeat to the interest rate.
So the interest

927
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:25.250
<v 2>rate has to go up.
So that's your argument made formal.</v>

928
00:59:26.810 --> 00:59:28.850
Okay,
so that's his impatience.
They rent.

929
00:59:28.851 --> 00:59:31.850
That's the main determinant of interest according to Fisher.

930
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:35.240
What's the second one?
Okay,
he says,

931
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:37.610
suppose people more optimistic.

932
00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:46.070
Optimistic
About,
um,

933
00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:50.720
he,
I too,
everybody thinks the world is going to be much better next year.

934
00:59:50.721 --> 00:59:52.160
We're going to have more endowments.

935
00:59:52.370 --> 00:59:54.320
What do you think's going to happen to the interest rate?

936
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:59.310
The real interest rate.
Somebody else.

937
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:06.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

938
01:00:06.030 --> 01:00:10.060
<v 2>It'll what?
Decrease.
Okay.
Why?</v>

939
01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:18.793
<v 1>Okay.</v>

940
01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:22.210
<v 2>Save less or to save more.</v>

941
01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:26.073
<v 1>Okay.</v>

942
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:28.850
<v 2>So let's think of a good acts won.</v>

943
01:00:28.851 --> 01:00:32.060
If people thought they're going to be richer at the old prices,

944
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:37.310
what would they do today for x one demand more or less today,

945
01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:42.450
right?
You have the right answer is up.
He said down,

946
01:00:42.451 --> 01:00:43.620
but let's just figure out why.

947
01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:51.000
Okay,
so this for the reason I gave the formal argument,

948
01:00:51.001 --> 01:00:55.290
as you can get confused here,
so,
uh,
let's just do the intuitive one.

949
01:00:55.291 --> 01:00:58.950
So you had the idea back there,
very intuitive when he just got,
got it backwards,

950
01:00:58.951 --> 01:01:00.900
but you're on the right track.
The point is,

951
01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:05.190
there's going to be so much stuff around for people to eat tomorrow.

952
01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:09.840
You've got to get them to want to eat all that extra stuff.
Tomorrow's,

953
01:01:09.841 --> 01:01:12.660
you have to give them an incentive to want to eat all that extra stuff tomorrow.

954
01:01:12.661 --> 01:01:15.600
So you have to raise the,
raise the interest rate,
not Lawrence,

955
01:01:15.601 --> 01:01:17.040
he had the right idea,
the wrong conclusion.

956
01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:19.650
Now how can you actually give a formal proof of that?

957
01:01:19.651 --> 01:01:24.030
So you know you're not confused again,
like his question.
So he asked,
okay,

958
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:25.710
at the old prices,

959
01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:30.240
what's going to happen to the demand for x one at the old prices?

960
01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:32.460
Since you're going to be so rich in the future,

961
01:01:32.461 --> 01:01:34.260
you think you're just incredibly rich now.

962
01:01:34.261 --> 01:01:36.360
So of course you're going to consume more today.

963
01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:40.650
So there's going to be more demand today and the endowment today hasn't changed.

964
01:01:40.651 --> 01:01:43.470
So there's going to be more in demand today with the same endowment today.

965
01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:47.550
So therefore,
uh,
in order to clear the market today,

966
01:01:47.551 --> 01:01:49.920
you're going to have to raise p one relative to p two.

967
01:01:49.921 --> 01:01:52.830
So the interest rate's got to go up.
Okay?
So

968
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:57.840
is that clear that it's a little surprising?
Okay.

969
01:01:57.841 --> 01:01:59.940
But so let me say that again.

970
01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:03.450
If you increase the endowments tomorrow,

971
01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:08.280
the supply today of goods hasn't changed,
but people are Richard Tomorrow.

972
01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:09.810
So clearly they're going to take,
you know,

973
01:02:09.811 --> 01:02:12.450
they're going to consume this fraction of their wealth.
The wealth is up.

974
01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.120
You tell anybody you're going to be rich,
you know,

975
01:02:15.121 --> 01:02:19.690
next year you're going to be worth a fortune.
The normal person you Cobb dug us,

976
01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:21.420
person's going to consume more stuff today,

977
01:02:21.421 --> 01:02:24.360
anticipating is going to be so rich tomorrow he's going to borrow against

978
01:02:24.361 --> 01:02:27.060
tomorrows a wealth.
And so therefore,

979
01:02:27.061 --> 01:02:30.270
in order to clear today's market where the supply hasn't changed with all these

980
01:02:30.271 --> 01:02:32.370
people trying to eat more today,

981
01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:34.710
you have to raise today's price relative tomorrow.

982
01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:37.590
That's raised the real interest rate.
Okay,

983
01:02:37.591 --> 01:02:42.180
so what's a third example?
Suppose,
uh,

984
01:02:42.210 --> 01:02:46.950
this is the fissures.
Most famous one.
Suppose you transfer money,

985
01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:51.840
transfer wealth from poor to rich.

986
01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:56.003
What would happen?

987
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:05.440
Okay,
we have to make an extra assumption here.

988
01:03:05.590 --> 01:03:08.950
Fisher felt that the people who were rich were rich because they were patient.

989
01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:12.940
Okay?
They could charge interest and get lots of money.
So if you change,

990
01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:15.850
if you change,
well,
if you take away some money from the poor,

991
01:03:15.851 --> 01:03:19.420
that's what's happened in the American economy over the last,
uh,
you know,

992
01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:20.950
15 or 20 years,

993
01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:23.890
the rich have gotten richer and the poor are pretty much back where they were

994
01:03:23.891 --> 01:03:27.580
before.
So suppose the rich get rich at the expense of the poor.

995
01:03:27.581 --> 01:03:29.800
What's going to that due to the real rate of interest?

996
01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:37.200
Okay,
I'll hang on a second.
He,
Yup.
That's gonna lower it.

997
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:38.063
Why is that?

998
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:48.100
Okay.
So you,
there's an intuitive way of saying it,
which is his,

999
01:03:48.101 --> 01:03:49.990
which is that the,
uh,

1000
01:03:50.050 --> 01:03:54.670
the rich because their patient are probably the lenders now they're even more

1001
01:03:54.671 --> 01:03:57.720
willing to lend.
And so the interest rate has to,
uh,

1002
01:03:57.910 --> 01:04:01.150
go down to get to these other people to borrow.
Okay.

1003
01:04:01.151 --> 01:04:06.010
Or a formal way of saying it is that if you transfer money from the rich to the

1004
01:04:06.011 --> 01:04:07.510
poor,
okay.

1005
01:04:07.511 --> 01:04:12.280
That means the poor guys because they've,

1006
01:04:12.970 --> 01:04:14.940
so the wealth,
th th the,

1007
01:04:14.941 --> 01:04:18.940
the rich guys always consume a higher proportion in the future because they're

1008
01:04:18.941 --> 01:04:21.970
more patients.
So more patient guy will consume more in the future.

1009
01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:23.560
So if you take away wealth from an,

1010
01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:28.720
from an impatient guy and give it to a patient guy,
you're going to increase.

1011
01:04:29.050 --> 01:04:32.380
Um,
the,
uh,

1012
01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.360
you're going to make more.

1013
01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:40.840
The economy is going to be more in the hands of the patient people.

1014
01:04:40.841 --> 01:04:44.020
And so the patient people,
the,
you know,
the mix is going to change.

1015
01:04:44.021 --> 01:04:46.450
People on average are more patient than they were before.

1016
01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.660
So on average in the economy that are going to be consumed less than they were

1017
01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:53.920
before of today's goods.
And so the shift is going to be in this direction,
right?

1018
01:04:53.921 --> 01:04:58.300
Cause you've taken,
you've made people,
a lot of them inpatient,
a lot of patient,

1019
01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:02.860
you've increased the patient ones and increase the impatient ones.
So on balance,

1020
01:05:02.861 --> 01:05:03.790
you're going to increase,

1021
01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:07.270
you're going to decrease demand today because it was the inpatient ones who

1022
01:05:07.271 --> 01:05:10.030
wanted to eat today and the other guys were willing to wait.
Now,

1023
01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:13.570
now the guys who are willing to wait,
these guys don't have any money.

1024
01:05:13.571 --> 01:05:16.260
They're the ones doing all the consuming today and now they're not.
They don't,

1025
01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:19.900
can't afford to it much consuming.
So you're going to reduce consumption today.

1026
01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:21.520
So to get the market to clear again,

1027
01:05:21.521 --> 01:05:23.680
you have to lower the interest rate this time.
Okay.

1028
01:05:23.681 --> 01:05:28.540
So those are three famous conclusions of Fisher.
More impatient people,

1029
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:33.280
higher interest rate,
more optimistic about the future.
Higher interest rate.

1030
01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:34.360
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1031
01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:38.440
<v 2>Transfers from the poor to the rich.
Lower interest rate.
Okay.</v>

1032
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:40.990
So what happens to the stock market in this case?

1033
01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:44.950
Suppose people are more impatient.
Does the stock market go up or down?

1034
01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.033
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1035
01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:56.160
<v 2>down because the stock market price is just this,</v>

1036
01:05:58.270 --> 01:06:00.310
the real interest rate times the dividends.

1037
01:06:00.311 --> 01:06:02.110
So I haven't told you the dividends changed.

1038
01:06:02.111 --> 01:06:04.480
So if the dividends are the same and they real interest rates gone up,

1039
01:06:04.481 --> 01:06:08.580
the stock market's gone down.
So what happens if,
uh,

1040
01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:13.390
oh impatience.
Suppose people more optimistic about the future.

1041
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:19.970
So not about the stocks producing more a bit about whether there's more stuff in

1042
01:06:19.971 --> 01:06:22.280
the world.
You know,
they're an own endowments will be bigger.

1043
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:23.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1044
01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:25.140
<v 2>The stock market's going to go down.
Okay.</v>

1045
01:06:25.141 --> 01:06:27.030
That one's a little subtler because they could be,

1046
01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:30.830
they could be optimistic about the stock prices,
about the stocks producing more.

1047
01:06:30.831 --> 01:06:32.820
So that's ambiguous.
So let's do the third.

1048
01:06:32.821 --> 01:06:35.550
Suppose you transfer wealth from the poor to the rich.

1049
01:06:35.551 --> 01:06:39.060
What's going to happen to the stock market?
It's going to go up.

1050
01:06:39.061 --> 01:06:42.900
So what happened in the last 20 years?
The rich got richer.
The poor God poor.

1051
01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:47.240
The interest rates got lower and lower in the stock market got higher and Higher

1052
01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.660
Justice Fisher would have said,
okay,

1053
01:06:48.661 --> 01:06:51.850
so I want to now and with just Fisher and Shakespeare.

1054
01:06:51.851 --> 01:06:56.700
So I'm going to go over just a couple minutes.
Um,
okay.
So,

1055
01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:58.233
<v 1>okay,</v>

1056
01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:02.390
<v 2>maybe I'll have to start with Shakespeare.</v>

1057
01:07:11.690 --> 01:07:16.500
Okay.
So Fisher's theory of interests,
as I said was,
was uh,

1058
01:07:16.830 --> 01:07:20.180
you know,
making sense of thousands of years of confusion.

1059
01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.500
So the,
the idea is that,

1060
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:25.380
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1061
01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:28.200
<v 2>interest is nothing other than you shouldn't think of nominal interest.</v>

1062
01:07:28.201 --> 01:07:29.490
People look through all that.

1063
01:07:29.491 --> 01:07:32.580
They look at the real rate of interest and the real rate of interest is just the

1064
01:07:32.581 --> 01:07:36.480
ratio of two prices,
just like everything else.
And Eq Librium.

1065
01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:41.550
So therefore there is no such thing as,
it's an important price.

1066
01:07:41.551 --> 01:07:44.520
Okay.
Like anything else,
but I've maybe I forgot to say it.

1067
01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:47.750
There's no such thing as adjust price.
The price in fact,

1068
01:07:47.751 --> 01:07:51.630
that equilibrium fines is the best price because that's the price that's gonna,

1069
01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:56.190
that's gonna lead new firms and inventors to use technologies that help the

1070
01:07:56.191 --> 01:07:59.190
economies opposed to hurting the economy and wasting resources.

1071
01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:03.150
So the price that the market finds is the just price and the real rate of

1072
01:08:03.151 --> 01:08:05.790
interest is the right wheel of rate of interest provided that people are

1073
01:08:05.791 --> 01:08:07.560
rational and see through this veil.

1074
01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:11.940
So why is it that the real rate of interest is typically positive?
Well,

1075
01:08:11.941 --> 01:08:15.990
it's because as I said,
you know,
people are,
uh,

1076
01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:18.200
<v 0>and there are these different reasons.
Okay.
Now,</v>

1077
01:08:18.201 --> 01:08:21.560
Fisher said one other reason that screws up the real rate of interest is people

1078
01:08:21.561 --> 01:08:25.190
sometimes get confused by inflation.
So this is an aside,

1079
01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:30.580
he said that all contracts should be inflation indexed and he forced his Yale

1080
01:08:30.741 --> 01:08:33.160
Secretary and his secretary,

1081
01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:37.070
his at his company to sign to change their contracts to get,

1082
01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:39.860
I guess as Gail second was probably wrong,
the secretaries that is as,

1083
01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:44.810
as business Remington,
he forced them to accept deals where they're,

1084
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:47.330
their wage was indexed to inflation.

1085
01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:50.810
And of course the great depression happened and all the prices collapsed and

1086
01:08:50.890 --> 01:08:53.630
these all the secretaries got less money out of the deal.

1087
01:08:53.631 --> 01:08:58.100
So they go if he wasn't too popular with them either.
But anyway,
so,

1088
01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:02.390
um,
okay.
He says impatience is a fundamental attribute of human nature.

1089
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:05.120
Okay.
As long as people like things today rather than tomorrow,

1090
01:09:05.121 --> 01:09:08.990
there's going to be interest.
So impatience,
interest is,
as it were,

1091
01:09:08.991 --> 01:09:12.590
inpatients crystallized into a market rate.
Okay.

1092
01:09:12.591 --> 01:09:16.760
And the reasons for inpatients or this foresight,
lack of foresight,

1093
01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:19.070
expectation,
you know,
possibility of dying.

1094
01:09:19.071 --> 01:09:21.380
And then he talks about self control and stuff like that.

1095
01:09:21.381 --> 01:09:24.110
The greater the foresight.
Okay.
Et cetera.
And now he,

1096
01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:28.280
now he has this racist view of the world,
which I think is worth mentioning.

1097
01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:32.600
So he compares the Scotch and the Irish.
Okay.
So the Scotch or patient,

1098
01:09:32.601 --> 01:09:35.060
the Irish are totally impatient.
Okay.

1099
01:09:35.061 --> 01:09:39.500
And then he no self control and it gets worse and worse.
Um,

1100
01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:44.600
I can show you all of this.
Okay.
So Holland,
Scotland,
England,
France,

1101
01:09:44.601 --> 01:09:45.021
you know,

1102
01:09:45.021 --> 01:09:47.960
these are all the places like his family was probably from their incredibly

1103
01:09:47.961 --> 01:09:50.570
patient.
They're wonderful.
They've got low rates of interest,

1104
01:09:50.571 --> 01:09:54.290
incredibly thrifty people.
Then you look at all these other dreadful people,

1105
01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:59.150
Chinese Indians,
blacks,
Java,
southerners,
you know,

1106
01:09:59.151 --> 01:10:01.310
American Indians and then Greeks and Italians,

1107
01:10:01.311 --> 01:10:05.930
he mentioned later hopeless high rates of interest in Greg will be impatient.
So,

1108
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:07.250
uh,
anyway,
the,
the,
the,

1109
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:12.230
the patient accumulate wealth and by waiting and lending they make production

1110
01:10:12.231 --> 01:10:14.270
possible because the people with all the good ideas,

1111
01:10:14.271 --> 01:10:16.100
where are they going to get the money to produce?

1112
01:10:16.190 --> 01:10:19.820
They're going to get it out of the patient.
People are willing to wait.
Okay.

1113
01:10:19.821 --> 01:10:23.900
Now if you could wait,
can shy talk for five more minutes or do you need to go?

1114
01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:26.780
I was going to do my,
maybe I should let you go anyway.

1115
01:10:26.781 --> 01:10:28.700
So what I was going to say last,
I won't say it,

1116
01:10:28.701 --> 01:10:33.650
is that Shakespeare anticipated all of fishers,
impatience,
theory of interest,

1117
01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:36.620
and when a step further he said,
well,
that's great,

1118
01:10:36.621 --> 01:10:39.530
but you should take into account that people won't keep their promises,

1119
01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:41.930
and if they don't keep their promises,
you need collateral.

1120
01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:44.360
And if we need collateral,
that's going to change a lot of stuff.

1121
01:10:44.361 --> 01:10:47.750
And Fisher and Shakespeare,
I already had a lot of that figured out.

1122
01:10:47.751 --> 01:10:50.570
Most of this course is going to be about,
which I believe it or not,

1123
01:10:50.571 --> 01:10:54.590
what Shakespeare had to say about the rate of interest in collateral.
Okay,
next,

1124
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:55.250
next time.
