00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.770
Hi.
Uh,
this is John Shinnecock.
Plus again,

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.240
I'm here to give a lecture that I gave one evening,
uh,

3
00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:10.530
that we couldn't record.

4
00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:14.070
So I'm going to try and reproduce the lecture as faithfully as I can.

5
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.140
And I think,
uh,
it's a historical lecture.
I hope you'll find it interesting.

6
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.270
It's about the history of the mortgage market,

7
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.510
and I call it a personal history because by some accident I participated at many

8
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:30.090
of the key points and the recent history of the mortgage market.

9
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.770
So I started off in eight,
1989.

10
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:38.730
I was professor here at Yale.
I was a mathematical economist.

11
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.820
I thought of myself as,
uh,

12
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.860
using mathematics to study economics and staying really pretty much as far from

13
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:48.630
the real world as I could.

14
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.070
But for some reason I decided that I wanted to see what was going on on Wall

15
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:53.431
Street.

16
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:58.431
The most interesting mathematical modeling of that day was being done on Wall

17
00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:02.340
Street and mathematical modeling and finance.
That is an economics.

18
00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:04.170
And so I decided why not go see it?

19
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.550
And so I visited a bunch of investment banks,

20
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.640
a number of my friends,
including one from Yale,

21
00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:15.810
had had worked at Goldman Sachs.
So that was the natural thing to do.

22
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.920
But I had a little cousin who had just been hired,
uh,

23
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.030
recently,
a little bit before that at a kidder Peabody,

24
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:26.640
which was sort of the number seventh,
uh,

25
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.370
Investment Bank of the time in terms of size.

26
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.970
And he introduced me to the fellow Ed Sarillo who ran fixed income at the time.

27
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.780
And they persuaded me that would be much more interesting to go to kidder

28
00:01:39.781 --> 00:01:42.170
Peabody and to talk to people like Ed Thrill,

29
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.320
then go to Goldman Sachs and be one of a hundred visiting professors.

30
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.510
So I decided that from was a little bit smaller,

31
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:51.630
but I'd see more of it and why not do something a little bit different.

32
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.760
So they'd never had an academic visitor.
I think,

33
00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:57.810
like me spend a year there before.
So I went in 1989,

34
00:01:57.811 --> 00:02:00.750
1990.
And uh,
while I was there,

35
00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:04.980
I talked a lot to Zarrillo until the traders and to a bunch of other people.

36
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.890
And at the end of the,
my sabbatical,

37
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.800
ed Sorello came to me and he said,
you know,

38
00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:14.310
I've come to realize that our fixed income research department isn't for a

39
00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:15.270
mathematical,

40
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.220
why don't you hire a research department for me and I'll help you along.

41
00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:24.120
But you find the people,
you know,
the subject,
uh,
you can judge,
you know,

42
00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:26.850
your business is judging people doing research.

43
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:30.780
Why don't you hire me a research department.
So I hired him,

44
00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:35.570
a research department,
which ultimately grew to 75 people.
And,
uh,

45
00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:39.150
I returned to Yale and after I got back to Yale,
he called me up and he said,

46
00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:41.310
you know,
now that you've hired the research department,

47
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:43.020
you have heads of all these different groups.

48
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.670
Why don't you run the research department and you can do it from Yale and,
uh,

49
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:48.780
as a consultant.

50
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.760
And so I became the head of fixed income research at kidder Peabody,
uh,

51
00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:55.830
from Yale.
And I,
uh,

52
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.260
it was quite an experience I hadn't realized when I accepted the job,

53
00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:02.560
just to how many complications would arise,

54
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:06.100
how many people would get job offers from other places and want to leave.

55
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:10.300
And how many models wouldn't work and then there'd have to be a wild scramble to

56
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:13.960
fix it.
But anyway,
that placed me at an investment bank,

57
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.450
a one of the what?

58
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.430
That would become one of the key players in the mortgage market now in the

59
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:20.260
mortgage market will,
who are the players,

60
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:22.180
whether the homeowners you all know about,

61
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.150
they're the banks who are giving mortgage loans.

62
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.110
But then there are a number of other players that are invisible to much of the

63
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:33.280
public,
which really dominate the market.
They're the government agencies,

64
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:36.190
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,
which you'll hear a lot about their,

65
00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:37.210
the investment banks,

66
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:40.330
like kidder Peabody and Goldman Sachs and a bunch of others.

67
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.630
They're the hedge funds and there are other investors and this group of people

68
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.660
creates a gigantic hierarchy,

69
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.690
an invisible market that's on the same size,

70
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:57.220
the same scale as the stock market.
So I think in that time,
1989,

71
00:03:57.221 --> 00:03:58.090
1990,

72
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.710
if you'd asked anyone in America practically what's an important financial

73
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:04.990
market,
they would have said to stock market.

74
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.410
What's another important financial market?
Corporate bond market.

75
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.530
What's another one?
Well,
um,

76
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.120
foreign exchange market,
what's another one?
Options market.

77
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.560
I don't think anyone would have said the mortgage market or at least they

78
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:23.320
wouldn't have put said it very early on in the,
in the,

79
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:28.030
in their list of important,
uh,
financial markets.
But in fact,

80
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:30.580
as I'm going to try and tell you during this class,

81
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.530
the mortgage market is on the scene,

82
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:34.810
not only on the same scale as the stock market,

83
00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:37.540
but actually quite a bit more complicated than the stock market,

84
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:39.400
more mathematical than the stock market.

85
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.040
And in some ways more interesting than the stock market.

86
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.540
And as we'll see at the end of the course,

87
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:47.350
it was the mortgage market that led to the greatest crisis we've had since the

88
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:51.820
depression and in fact caused several similar crisis before that.

89
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.140
So,
uh,
mortgages appear at the bottom.

90
00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.320
You have homeowners living in their houses who need to borrow the money to buy

91
00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:03.610
the house before they can live in the house.

92
00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:05.050
They have to get the money to buy the house.

93
00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:09.190
So they borrow the money by taking out a mortgage and it's a bank or a thrift or

94
00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:12.370
somebody like that who lends them the money.
That's the first step.

95
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
So a mortgage is just a promise to pay the loan back over a long period of time

96
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.030
using your house as collateral.
Uh,

97
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:25.630
an important part of mortgages is that you have an option to prepay the
mortgage.

98
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.841
I mean,

99
00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:30.520
what if you move the mortgages to say a 30 year promise and after three years

100
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:33.610
you might want to move.
So if you're gone from the house,

101
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:36.820
the house can no longer serve as collateral because you don't live in it
anymore.

102
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.430
So there has to be some way of getting out of the mortgage.

103
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.330
And so there's an option to prepay it.
Now in the United States,

104
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:45.970
that option can be used even if you stay in the house.

105
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:49.410
And it turns out to be one of the more problematic,
uh,

106
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.170
aspects of valuing mortgages and one of the most interesting aspects of my

107
00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:57.560
failure with mortgages.
But we'll come to that later.
So this idea of a mortgage,

108
00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.831
uh,

109
00:05:57.831 --> 00:06:02.831
those three ideas were already known to the Babylonians more than 3000 years

110
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:07.590
ago.
So the mortgage is not a recent invention.
It wasn't invented,
uh,

111
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.310
uh,
you know,
after the industrial revolution,

112
00:06:10.311 --> 00:06:14.150
it was invented more than 3000 years ago,
uh,
near the Middle East.

113
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.920
So,
uh,

114
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:20.921
it stayed pretty much the same for most of those 3000 years until the 1930s when

115
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:26.860
the amortizing mortgage was invented.
So what happened in the 1930s,

116
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.070
that was the time of the Great Depression and farmers had lots of mortgages and

117
00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:34.820
they would owe $7 a year,
say,
is their interest payment.

118
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:39.740
And at the end of the 10 or 15 years,
they'd have to pay $107.

119
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:42.920
That is,
they make their interest payment and they pay back the balance,

120
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.330
what's called now a balloon payment.
That's how a typical bond works.
Well,

121
00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:49.250
of course,
when things got really bad,

122
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.630
a lot of them defaulted and naturally they chose to default just before the

123
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.920
hundred $7 payment.
So seeing that,
uh,

124
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.250
mortgage lenders decided that it would be much safer to make a flat mortgage

125
00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:07.700
loan where the payment was say $8 a year for all of 30 years.

126
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.940
Now you pay a little bit more each year for 29 years,

127
00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:13.670
but then you continue to pay the eight,
the 30th year.
But you see,

128
00:07:13.671 --> 00:07:17.510
if you add up all the extra payments and you realize that there's discounting

129
00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:21.320
the hundred seven way off in the end isn't really that much money it's looked at

130
00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:24.920
from the beginning.
And so by paying eight every year,

131
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.620
you can get the same,
uh,

132
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.970
present discounted value of paying seven 29 years in 107 the 30th year.

133
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.710
So that's called the amortizing mortgage.

134
00:07:33.711 --> 00:07:38.000
It makes the lender much safer because after a bunch of years have gone by,

135
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.940
uh,
the house presumably has gone up in value,

136
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:42.650
or even if it hasn't gone up in value,

137
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:46.270
the remaining payments are much less because so many have been made.
The,
the,

138
00:07:46.271 --> 00:07:50.920
the balance has been amortized.
And so actually to get out of your mortgage,
you,

139
00:07:50.921 --> 00:07:53.600
you need to pay less than a hundred dollars back.

140
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.350
So this amortizing mortgage is something we're going to study mathematically in

141
00:07:57.351 --> 00:07:58.041
the next lecture.

142
00:07:58.041 --> 00:08:01.970
But now I just mentioned that was one of the big innovations which made the

143
00:08:01.971 --> 00:08:05.270
mortgage market much safer than it had been before.
Well,

144
00:08:05.271 --> 00:08:09.050
so things continued pretty much the same from the 1930s all the way till the

145
00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:12.260
1970s when we had securitization.

146
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:16.160
Like many of the great financial innovations and in history,

147
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.260
this one was created by the government.

148
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:23.100
So a Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were government agencies and they had,

149
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:26.900
they were given the job,
they were created by the government.
Uh,

150
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.770
they then became eventually separate from the government,
but they had the,

151
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.150
they were given the task,

152
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:35.870
they were created for the purpose of making mortgage pass throughs.

153
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.820
So we're in the 1970s.

154
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.290
So mortgage pass throughs are the second tier of this hierarchy.

155
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.230
So the banks who had lent the mortgage,

156
00:08:45.231 --> 00:08:47.060
remember when you take out a mortgage as a homeowner,

157
00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:48.380
you're selling your promise,

158
00:08:48.381 --> 00:08:51.200
you're getting the money by selling your promise to pay back later.

159
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.770
So those promises are collected by the banks.
And instead of just sitting on the,

160
00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:00.260
the banks now with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could sell their promises,
uh,

161
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.780
to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would put them

162
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:07.350
together in gigantic pools called pass through pools.

163
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.880
Why were they called pass throughs?

164
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:12.900
Because the mortgage payments the homeowner's made would go to the banks and the

165
00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:17.901
banks would just pass them on to the pools and then the pools would collect the

166
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:21.780
money and pass that money on to the shareholders.

167
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:26.400
So the ultimate lenders to the homeowners are the people who buy shares in the

168
00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:28.800
fanny and Freddy pools.

169
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:32.070
So the banks appear to the homeowner to be lending the money,

170
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:34.860
but actually they're not lending it at all.
They're the middleman.

171
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.390
And so they collect the money from the homeowner and they send it on to the

172
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:43.230
actual lender who's the shareholder in the pool.
And the banks are also there.

173
00:09:43.231 --> 00:09:47.030
The service are really,
they're getting paid a fee for collecting the money and,

174
00:09:47.031 --> 00:09:50.100
and writing threatening letters.
If the home owner stops paying.

175
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.820
And as we'll see later throwing the homeowner out of his house if the homeowner

176
00:09:53.821 --> 00:09:57.520
doesn't pay.
So Fanny and Freddy,
uh,

177
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.010
played an extraordinarily important role in the mortgage market.
First of all,

178
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.740
not any mortgage could be sold into these pools.

179
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:08.940
They had to meet strict criterions.
You had to have a good credit rating,

180
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.320
you had to have a job,
you had to have all sorts of,

181
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.870
uh,
sorry about this.

182
00:10:15.871 --> 00:10:18.990
I'm going to have to shut off my cell phone.

183
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.553
Um,

184
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:26.843
<v 1>okay.</v>

185
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.140
<v 0>So you and the,
uh,</v>

186
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:33.850
the loan to value of the mortgage had to be that is that the house is worth a

187
00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:37.650
hundred.
The loan could only be 80% of it.
Um,
uh,

188
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.290
you had to have a record of the job you had a and so on.

189
00:10:41.291 --> 00:10:45.430
So this was a very,
um,

190
00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:50.530
very standardized and very high performing loans.

191
00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.180
So you could contrast this,

192
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:57.190
say to the world that you might've seen in the movie.
It's a wonderful life.

193
00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.690
So in the movie,
it's a wonderful life.

194
00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:03.190
You remember Jimmy Stewart runs a thrift and he makes mortgage loans and people

195
00:11:03.191 --> 00:11:05.650
come to him and they say we want alone.
And He,
you know,

196
00:11:05.651 --> 00:11:10.150
one guy comes through and says he wants a loan.
Uh,
Jimmy Stewart says,
well,

197
00:11:10.151 --> 00:11:13.540
do you have,
do you have any collateral?
No,
I haven't built a house yet.

198
00:11:13.541 --> 00:11:17.980
I'm trying to build the house.
Do you have,
do you have a record of employment?

199
00:11:17.981 --> 00:11:22.840
No,
I've just moved here.
I don't have,
you know,
I even have a job yet.
Um,
uh,

200
00:11:22.841 --> 00:11:27.100
do you have someone who can vouch for,
you know,
um,
do you have a credit rating?

201
00:11:27.101 --> 00:11:29.260
No,
there is no such thing as credit rating.

202
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.310
So then Jimmy Stewart looks into his eyes and realizes this is a good honest

203
00:11:33.311 --> 00:11:35.650
person and gives them alone.
Well,

204
00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.010
that doesn't happen in the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pools.

205
00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.520
They're very standardized criteria and uh,

206
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:46.600
very that that Guy Marta on who got the loan from Jimmy Stewart would never have

207
00:11:46.601 --> 00:11:51.601
gotten a conforming Fannie and Freddie or Freddie loan in the 1980s or nineties.

208
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.830
Might've gotten one in the two thousands though.
But we'll come back to that.

209
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.040
So that kind of a market is very much like the kind of market in the Jimmy

210
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.330
Stewart movie.
It's a wonderful life that gets created in his fantasy where,

211
00:12:07.331 --> 00:12:07.960
you know,

212
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.490
the town gets taken over by the evil banker and that evil banker whose name I've

213
00:12:12.491 --> 00:12:13.810
forgotten at the moment,

214
00:12:13.811 --> 00:12:18.250
but that evil banker basically is creating the kind of loans almost that we're

215
00:12:18.251 --> 00:12:21.160
talking about.
Now.
Everything's mechanized and standardized.

216
00:12:21.161 --> 00:12:26.161
But of course with standardization you get tremendous advantages for one thing,

217
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:30.320
um,
these loans,
uh,

218
00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:35.620
be I boy pulled together and being of the same general good quality.

219
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:40.100
They allow the lenders instead of lending to a bunch of homeowners and Peoria

220
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.290
like the bank would do.

221
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.710
Now all those Peoria loans are stuck with a bunch of other loans from all over

222
00:12:44.711 --> 00:12:47.440
the country in the same big Fannie pool.

223
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:51.010
And so the lenders who are the shareholders have diversified their risk.

224
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.220
If the big businesses in Peoria,
Illinois go under,

225
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:58.150
it might be that all of the homeowners in Peoria will default on their
mortgages,

226
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.690
but not in the Fannie and Freddie pools because those are loans from all over

227
00:13:01.691 --> 00:13:03.220
the country.
So you don't,

228
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.280
it would have to be that businesses all over the country went bad for those

229
00:13:06.281 --> 00:13:09.310
loans all to go bad.
So secondly,

230
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.940
if you're getting a whole pool and there's an automatic criteria,

231
00:13:12.941 --> 00:13:14.230
and for getting into the pool,

232
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.380
you don't have to worry that you're getting the worst loans or the cheesiest

233
00:13:17.381 --> 00:13:20.740
loans or something,
you know,
the quality,
the general quality of all the loans.

234
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:25.990
And once you have shares in a pool,
um,
you can resell the shares.

235
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.800
So a bank who has to study the homeowner and,
and uh,
you know,

236
00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:33.100
we have meetings with them and you know,
Jimmy Stewart had to look into his eyes.

237
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.430
So Jimmy Stewart may have convinced himself the guys a good risks,

238
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:39.370
but how could Jimmy Stewart ever sell the loan to somebody else?

239
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.190
The other buyer who hasn't looked into Martin's eyes,

240
00:13:42.191 --> 00:13:44.620
he's never going to believe Jimmy Stewart that that's a good loan.

241
00:13:44.621 --> 00:13:48.820
So Jimmy Stewart is going to be stuck with that loan for 30 years in the Fannie

242
00:13:48.821 --> 00:13:49.840
and Freddie pools.

243
00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:53.650
The shareholder who buys the loans and knows their standardized,

244
00:13:53.651 --> 00:13:57.160
knows exactly the same thing as the next guy who might buy his shares from them.

245
00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.550
So if the shareholder will be willing to pay more for the loan,

246
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.150
because he knows that if he needs cash,
he doesn't have to wait 30 years,

247
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:08.470
he can just sell his shares to somebody else.
So because of the diversification,

248
00:14:08.471 --> 00:14:12.040
because of the reduction in adverse selection and because of this ability to

249
00:14:12.041 --> 00:14:13.120
resell the shares,

250
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.080
lenders that has shareholders are willing to pay more for the mortgages.

251
00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:18.730
And so the mortgage rate went down.

252
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:24.160
So I've estimated that this operation together with the next one I'm going to

253
00:14:24.161 --> 00:14:28.300
talk about has reduced mortgage rates by at least a percent.

254
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:33.010
So if you think the average loan is 200,000,
you're talking about um,
you know,

255
00:14:33.011 --> 00:14:37.690
$2,000 a year that the average home owner saved by this financial innovation.

256
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.440
So securitization seems to have been a great boon.

257
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.690
Now in 2002 when I made these slides,

258
00:14:43.691 --> 00:14:45.850
I'll just give you an idea of the size of the,

259
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.930
of the mortgage market and you have to double all these numbers today pretty

260
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:54.710
much.
So you see that the know the stock market was around 15 trillion and the

261
00:14:54.711 --> 00:14:58.460
mortgages were around 7 trillion at the time.
And you know,

262
00:14:58.461 --> 00:15:02.290
that compares to 2 trillion for corporate bonds and uh,

263
00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:03.980
or 3 trillion for treasuries.

264
00:15:03.981 --> 00:15:07.370
You see how big the mortgage market was then and now it's twice as big as the

265
00:15:07.371 --> 00:15:11.360
same size as the,
basically as the stock market,

266
00:15:11.361 --> 00:15:16.260
which hasn't really grown since then.
So,
um,
you know many,
well,

267
00:15:16.261 --> 00:15:18.380
I'm not going to talk,
but I don't have time to talk about this,

268
00:15:18.381 --> 00:15:22.580
but of course of the mortgage market,
some of it is commercial,

269
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.310
some of it is residential.
The vast majority is residential,

270
00:15:25.311 --> 00:15:27.350
but there's a very big commercial mortgage market.

271
00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:32.330
I'm going to be talking mostly about the,
the,
uh,
the residential mortgage market.

272
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:37.040
Some of these mortgages are in fact held by the banks without selling them to

273
00:15:37.041 --> 00:15:38.180
Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.

274
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.260
But a lot of them are securitized just in the way we talked about.

275
00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:45.080
And they're going to be private securitizations later that we'll talk about.

276
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:46.640
And so,
um,

277
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:51.350
now that securitized part is 10 trillion.
Um,

278
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:56.660
I'll give you the numbers,
uh,
uh,
uh,
recent numbers later.

279
00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:01.400
So actually that maybe a little bit big,
the slight,
these 7 trillion,

280
00:16:01.401 --> 00:16:05.090
the securitized part of the mortgage market.
So,
uh,

281
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.910
in 2002,
the,
uh,

282
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:12.880
agencies dominated the security market.
The securitized,
uh,

283
00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.830
uh,
loans were almost all Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

284
00:16:15.831 --> 00:16:20.450
There's also another agency called Ginnie Mae,
but there's another part of it.

285
00:16:20.451 --> 00:16:23.900
There was another part of it,
which were jumbo loans.
So there was a size limit.

286
00:16:23.901 --> 00:16:26.960
The loans couldn't be too small and couldn't be too big for these Fannie and

287
00:16:26.961 --> 00:16:29.240
Freddie pools.
Uh,
we are trying to,

288
00:16:29.241 --> 00:16:32.000
the government was trying to appeal to the middle class,

289
00:16:32.001 --> 00:16:35.540
establish homeowner ship in the reliable middle class.

290
00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:38.390
And so the wealthy were buying million dollar homes,

291
00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:43.400
weren't able to get their loans sold into a Fannie or Freddie pool.

292
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.850
And so those loans were securitize the same way,

293
00:16:46.851 --> 00:16:49.880
but by private agencies and not by,
by banks,

294
00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:53.780
by investment banks and not by the government.

295
00:16:53.781 --> 00:16:57.370
And that at the time in 2002 was half a trillion.
But we'll come to all these,
uh,

296
00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.860
numbers,
uh,
later what he'd say.
Today's numbers.

297
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.760
So the next innovation after the 1970s came in the 80s,

298
00:17:04.761 --> 00:17:09.110
and that's the collateralized mortgage obligation market.
CMOS,
they're called.

299
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:14.010
So the investment banks like kidder Peabody and Lehman Brothers,
um,

300
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:15.140
for example,

301
00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:19.430
would buy some of these big pools and then they would cut the pools,

302
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.560
which were just pass through.
So the pools just pass through the money that the,

303
00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.670
that the homeowners we're giving them.

304
00:17:25.671 --> 00:17:30.290
So maybe they were passing through $1,000 a month.
It's the promise.
Well,

305
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:36.310
say kidder Peabody might buy a pool promising $1,000 a month to the shareholders

306
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:41.090
and then cut the promise into two pieces,
maybe a floater,

307
00:17:41.091 --> 00:17:44.900
which would pay $500 plus the interest rate.
And uh,

308
00:17:44.901 --> 00:17:47.630
so when the interest rate went up,
the payments would go up.

309
00:17:47.631 --> 00:17:48.950
That's why it's called a floater.

310
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.120
And maybe a second piece called an inverse floater,

311
00:17:51.121 --> 00:17:55.050
which is $500 minus the interest rate.
So as the interest rate went up,

312
00:17:55.051 --> 00:17:57.660
the payments would get smaller,
but as the interest rate went down,

313
00:17:57.661 --> 00:18:00.000
the payments would get bigger.
That's called an inverse floater.

314
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.850
So that way the to add up to a thousand dollars,

315
00:18:02.851 --> 00:18:05.760
but now you can appeal to two different buyers.

316
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.810
A buyer who needs the money when interest rates go up,
would buy the floater.

317
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.090
A buyer who needs the money when interest rates go down,

318
00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:13.320
would buy the inverse floater.

319
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:18.270
So by creating out of plain vanilla promise to more tailored promises,

320
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.730
you can target,
uh,
uh,

321
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.290
more sharply a clientele and therefore get probably more than half the money for

322
00:18:25.291 --> 00:18:28.320
each of the two pieces.
And that way of course,

323
00:18:28.321 --> 00:18:30.960
competition in the CML market raises the,

324
00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:35.460
the amount people are willing to pay for the pass throughs because they can then

325
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:40.080
buy them and split them up and sell them for a big,
uh,
for more.

326
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:42.090
So that raises the price of the pass throughs,

327
00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:44.130
which in turn raises the price of the mortgage.

328
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.570
The home owners can sell their mortgage,

329
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:49.500
which in turn lowers the interest rate that the homeowners have to pay.
So again,

330
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:50.580
it's another one,

331
00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:55.610
another reason why this whole operation of securitization improved the welfare

332
00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:58.800
of almost everybody.

333
00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:03.390
So the pieces has gradually got more complicated.

334
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.351
So you know,

335
00:19:04.351 --> 00:19:08.220
if there was default or somebody prepaid as we talked about and use their option

336
00:19:08.221 --> 00:19:11.070
to pay early,
instead of getting the money you expected,

337
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:15.720
you'd get extra or less money than you expected.
And that created risk.

338
00:19:15.721 --> 00:19:18.300
And some of these buyers didn't want to bear the risk.

339
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.710
So maybe you'd make the pieces 400 plus the interest rate and 400 minus the

340
00:19:22.711 --> 00:19:27.630
interest rate and leave $200 to what might be called a residual piece or a

341
00:19:27.631 --> 00:19:31.080
derivative or something.
And that $200 would bear the risk.

342
00:19:31.081 --> 00:19:32.190
So if someone defaulted,

343
00:19:32.191 --> 00:19:36.870
you take it out of the $200 a piece and not under the first two pieces.
So,

344
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.760
um,
that,
uh,

345
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:43.200
split up again made the float in inverse floaters safer and encourage people to

346
00:19:43.201 --> 00:19:46.290
buy it.
But of course somebody had to buy the residual piece,

347
00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:50.540
which was more complicated.
So as I said,
um,

348
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:54.900
this whole operation was a way of accomplishing two things.

349
00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.020
It made homeowners able to sell their promises for more,

350
00:19:58.021 --> 00:20:00.230
so they effectively were paying a lower interest rate.

351
00:20:00.231 --> 00:20:02.790
So it made it easier to move into houses.

352
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:06.090
And that's precisely what the government intended.
By creating these agencies,

353
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:11.270
it also allowed buyers and investors to get money in the cases they needed it in

354
00:20:12.121 --> 00:20:15.420
the states.
They needed it because the pieces were tailor made for them.

355
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:20.040
So I realized while I was there at kidder Peabody,

356
00:20:20.041 --> 00:20:24.510
that this whole multi trillion dollar operation behind the scenes was,
as I said,

357
00:20:24.511 --> 00:20:29.090
invisible to everybody and is worth writing about.
And uh,
it,

358
00:20:29.091 --> 00:20:33.420
it was bringing a great welfare game to the country and,

359
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:35.910
and nobody quite knew about it.
So for me,

360
00:20:35.911 --> 00:20:40.080
it crystallized what the essence of finances,
the essence of finances.

361
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.240
You're trying to create promises.

362
00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:47.110
The financial system is creating promises that deliver money to people in

363
00:20:47.111 --> 00:20:51.010
circumstances or states,
as I call it,
that they really need the money.

364
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.090
But of course you have to guarantee that the money is going to be paid to them.

365
00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.370
So in order to do that,
you have to have collateral.

366
00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:02.550
So this entire system is a way of creating promises and backing them with

367
00:21:02.741 --> 00:21:04.570
collateral.
So if you remember,

368
00:21:04.571 --> 00:21:08.650
so here are the potential promises and maybe some people want money down here.

369
00:21:08.651 --> 00:21:11.860
That's when the interest rates go up.
They're buying the floaters way over there.

370
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.800
The money's going down,
the interest rates are going down.

371
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.570
That's the people who buy the inverse floaters.

372
00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.600
That's when they're getting most of their money.
So,

373
00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:23.890
but these promises you have a reason to expect to get paid because they're

374
00:21:23.891 --> 00:21:28.420
backed by the collateral.
Okay.
So the is not a very good picture.

375
00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.770
The houses back the promises of the homeowners,
like in Babylonian Times,

376
00:21:32.771 --> 00:21:36.850
if the homeowner doesn't pay,
he loses his house.
Then the,
the,

377
00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:38.830
those mortgages themselves,

378
00:21:38.831 --> 00:21:43.831
those mortgage promises are backing the pools which are selling shares to the

379
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:48.520
shareholders.
But those shares are backing the Cmos,

380
00:21:48.521 --> 00:21:50.530
which are making more complicated promises.

381
00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:54.310
So the collateral you see is used once by the homes,
once by the pools,

382
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.040
once for the cmos.
And then it will turn out as,

383
00:21:57.041 --> 00:22:02.041
we'll see a in a few minutes that the investors who buy our borrowing money and

384
00:22:02.591 --> 00:22:06.160
buying on margin using the CMO piece is they buy as collateral for their

385
00:22:06.161 --> 00:22:09.850
purchases.
So the collateral is being used and reused.
And so in fact,

386
00:22:09.851 --> 00:22:14.650
the entire system is stretching the available collateral as much as possible.

387
00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:17.170
So collaterals are very scarce resource.

388
00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.480
It's very important to running a financial system.

389
00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:23.050
Many developing countries don't have any collateral and therefore they have a

390
00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:25.570
primitive financial system here.

391
00:22:25.571 --> 00:22:28.780
There's a tremendous incentive to stretch the collateral as much as possible.

392
00:22:28.781 --> 00:22:32.590
You can stretch it by using it over and over again or by letting the same

393
00:22:32.591 --> 00:22:36.040
collateral back many promises.
And we saw both of those,
the trenching,

394
00:22:36.041 --> 00:22:38.620
the different CMO pieces and the pyramiding,

395
00:22:38.621 --> 00:22:43.330
the using the same collateral over and over again.
So,
um,

396
00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:49.090
so I wrote my first paper,
published it in 1997 while I was,
uh,

397
00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:51.400
I had written it while I was at kidder Peabody.

398
00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:54.610
And one of the questions I asked was,
when you take out a loan,

399
00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.160
not only what interest rate do you have to pay,

400
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:59.200
but how much collateral do you have to put up?

401
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.520
And that was a question that nobody seemed to have asked really before,
uh,

402
00:23:03.521 --> 00:23:07.780
in a general equilibrium model.
And so I,
that was my first paper on the subject.

403
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:12.310
Now I want to get back to kidder Peabody.
Kitter Peabody's I said when I started,

404
00:23:12.311 --> 00:23:14.080
it was a sleepy,
uh,

405
00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:18.580
number seven ranked investment bank didn't dominate any market,

406
00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:23.650
but it came to completely dominate the CMO market.
So this,

407
00:23:23.651 --> 00:23:26.680
as I said,
was a multi trillion dollar market.

408
00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:30.820
And if you look at all the pieces that are being promised here,

409
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:35.650
what Kitter decided to do was,
uh,
you know,
things got more and more complicated.

410
00:23:35.651 --> 00:23:37.780
They weren't just two pieces that weren't just three pieces.

411
00:23:37.781 --> 00:23:42.610
There were 90 pieces typically at that time.
And so a typical,
uh,

412
00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:47.570
uh,
investment bank that wants sell,
you know,
buy a pool of Ansel,

413
00:23:47.571 --> 00:23:52.160
the CMO pieces like let's say Solomon or First Boston,

414
00:23:52.161 --> 00:23:54.200
they were the ones who first did these cmos,

415
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.160
they would try to line up 90 buyers and figure out what each of the 90 we're

416
00:23:58.161 --> 00:24:01.400
willing to pay.
And then when they added up the prices,
each of the 90,

417
00:24:01.401 --> 00:24:04.370
we're willing to pay,
they'd go and if they thought the,

418
00:24:04.371 --> 00:24:06.530
some of those was bigger than the price of the pool,

419
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:10.430
they'd go to the pool and by the pool and then immediately make a profit by

420
00:24:10.431 --> 00:24:14.630
selling off the 90 pieces.
Well it kid her,
um,

421
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.930
the head of mortgages who by this time,
by the way,

422
00:24:17.931 --> 00:24:22.590
was my young little cousin who,
um,
through one,

423
00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:25.100
well not accident after another,
but anyway,

424
00:24:25.101 --> 00:24:29.960
through hard work had worked his way up to running the small a CMO operation.

425
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.640
He got the idea that would kill her could do was to find a buyer for the

426
00:24:34.641 --> 00:24:37.960
riskiest piece.
The one that I've put in yellow,
remember the residual,

427
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:41.600
which was maybe called an inverse io.
It had different names,

428
00:24:41.601 --> 00:24:42.710
but the riskiest pieces,

429
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.670
once he finally found a buyer or a place to put the riskiest piece,

430
00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:48.290
he would borrow the money,

431
00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:53.120
buy the pass through and hold an inventory of all the other pieces.

432
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:57.770
So he knew that eventually we would be able to sell off all the other pieces.

433
00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.440
And so we had a tremendous advantage.

434
00:25:00.441 --> 00:25:03.260
While everyone else was looking for buyers for 90 pieces,

435
00:25:03.261 --> 00:25:07.820
we had to find a buyer for one piece or two pieces.
So we then had a,

436
00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:12.770
uh,
an inventory of 88 pieces say to sell.
And as we did deal after deal,

437
00:25:12.771 --> 00:25:14.870
that inventory,
we get bigger and bigger.
So are other,

438
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.380
salesforce would have a much easier time selling a piece.

439
00:25:18.381 --> 00:25:22.100
We wouldn't have to call someone up and say,
do you want piece number four,

440
00:25:22.101 --> 00:25:23.930
that's the one we're trying to get you to buy.

441
00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:29.140
We'd call up and say we've got a huge stock of different kinds of pieces of all

442
00:25:29.301 --> 00:25:32.270
kinds from all kinds of deals.
Maybe you're interested in one of them.

443
00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.230
So it was much easier for a sales force to sell with that situation than it was

444
00:25:36.231 --> 00:25:37.850
for the other investment banks to sell.

445
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.800
So of course we lured away some of the best sales people.
So,
um,

446
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:48.380
of course the downside to all of that is we had to be very careful that the

447
00:25:48.381 --> 00:25:50.810
pieces we held,
we knew how to hedge.

448
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.990
We had to be very careful that when we held these pieces between the time he

449
00:25:53.991 --> 00:25:57.800
held them and finally sold them,
we didn't lose a lot of money.
So we had to fix.

450
00:25:57.801 --> 00:26:00.860
And sometimes we are the ones who held the most dangerous piece too.

451
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:05.540
So we had to figure out what we're going to be the cash flows of these pieces

452
00:26:05.541 --> 00:26:06.440
and how to model them.

453
00:26:06.441 --> 00:26:09.050
And that's what we're going to mathematically talk about the next few days.

454
00:26:09.051 --> 00:26:13.580
But I'm going to give you a hint of this now.
So we had to predict,

455
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:16.790
among other things with the prepayments would be okay.

456
00:26:16.791 --> 00:26:20.210
And so if you talk to a macro economist,

457
00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:23.690
especially in those days and you say,
you know,

458
00:26:23.691 --> 00:26:26.270
what do you think's going to happen in the world?
They'll usually say,

459
00:26:26.271 --> 00:26:31.271
well I think in the next two quarters unemployment is going to go up half a

460
00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.780
percent and then maybe things you're going to get better for the next year and

461
00:26:35.781 --> 00:26:37.520
beyond that it's too hard to tell.

462
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:41.150
So these mortgages are 30 year mortgages.

463
00:26:41.151 --> 00:26:43.680
You can't have a prediction that lasts a year and a half.

464
00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.980
You have to have a 30 year prediction.
And the macro economist by the way,

465
00:26:46.981 --> 00:26:50.250
are typically wrong even in their two months prediction or six months
prediction.

466
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:55.400
So how could we risk billions of dollars holding an instrument that's 30 years

467
00:26:55.471 --> 00:26:59.220
long,
which depends on what people are going to do over the next 30 years.
Well,

468
00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:02.790
the answer is you can't make a prediction and expect it to be right,

469
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.670
but you could make a conditional prediction.
You can say,

470
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.700
if interest rates do such and such for the next four years,

471
00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:13.110
then prepaid and housing prices do such and such for the next four years,

472
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.500
then in that fifth year prepayments will be so and so.

473
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.240
That's a conditional prediction.

474
00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:20.670
It's much easier to make a conditional prediction than an,

475
00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.980
than an unconditional prediction.

476
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:28.160
It's shocking that so many economists are lured into making unconditional

477
00:27:28.951 --> 00:27:31.290
predictions.
It's not a business we should be in.

478
00:27:31.291 --> 00:27:33.450
We should always be making conditional predictions.
Well,

479
00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:37.320
I learned that lesson at,
uh,
at kidder.
So you know,

480
00:27:37.321 --> 00:27:40.740
the idea of possible worlds is going to play a central role in our chorus from

481
00:27:40.741 --> 00:27:44.550
here on out.
And,
uh,
the possible worlds of the pads of interest rates are,

482
00:27:44.551 --> 00:27:48.900
or our home prices.
And so you know,
here's a,
a very short,

483
00:27:48.901 --> 00:27:53.280
this is maybe a one year into the future and we'd have to go 30 years into the

484
00:27:53.281 --> 00:27:56.070
future.
So you can imagine,
and this is just uh,

485
00:27:56.130 --> 00:28:00.600
actually much smaller group of possibilities than uh,
than we used to consider,

486
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:04.140
but you see all the possibilities that could unfold over the next 12 months.

487
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.800
And you see the Blue Line is one of those possible paths.

488
00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:12.120
So we have to predict if we knew which path interest rates and housing prices

489
00:28:12.121 --> 00:28:14.610
were going to take,
like that Blue Line,

490
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:18.900
could we then predict at the end of the Blue Line what prepayments would be?

491
00:28:18.901 --> 00:28:21.840
Of course,
if the,
if you followed another path down to here,

492
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:26.400
we'd make a different prediction about prepayments.
So the cash flows or the,

493
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.880
or the prepayments and defaults that what was,
that's what we have to predict.

494
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.870
And so
you might say,

495
00:28:33.871 --> 00:28:37.350
what good is it to predict a different number on each of these trees?

496
00:28:37.351 --> 00:28:38.450
Then you just basically don't,

497
00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:40.440
we are saying you don't know what's going to happen.

498
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:42.210
But that's far from the truth.

499
00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:46.770
If you know what the payments are on each of the paths and then you can hedge

500
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.440
those paths.
So for example,

501
00:28:49.441 --> 00:28:53.100
suppose the payments very low here and very high at the top.
Well,

502
00:28:53.101 --> 00:28:57.810
if you can buy another instrument that pays you something at the bottom,
uh,
and,

503
00:28:57.811 --> 00:28:59.700
and,
and you pay at the top,

504
00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:03.750
you can offset the variation and cash flows on the mortgage by that other

505
00:29:03.751 --> 00:29:07.530
instrument and guarantee yourself the same safe payment all the way through.

506
00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:09.960
But that's the sort of thing that we did at kidder Peabody,

507
00:29:09.961 --> 00:29:11.610
which you're going to study in great detail.

508
00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.720
We hold held these complicated pieces,
who's payments would vary tremendously.

509
00:29:15.721 --> 00:29:17.970
So we ran a huge risk of losing all our money,

510
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.060
but then we would hedge them with some other instrument.
So in the end,

511
00:29:21.061 --> 00:29:24.630
we've got a pretty safe return.
And because we knew the return was safe,

512
00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:27.510
we felt we could pay a good amount of money for it,

513
00:29:27.511 --> 00:29:31.260
whereas other buyers who couldn't hedge it wouldn't want to buy it at all.

514
00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.550
So now let's just see how good the,
the,
the predictions were.

515
00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:40.490
Here's a typical history of a prepayments.
So you can see it's,
it goes,

516
00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:44.890
it ranges from to 99 from um,

517
00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:50.260
88 something like that.
So it's a 10 years,
11 years of prepayments.

518
00:29:50.261 --> 00:29:54.040
So that's the percentage of people who prepay every year.

519
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:55.720
So it's the analyzed percentage.

520
00:29:55.721 --> 00:29:59.860
So every month you check how many people paid off their mortgage early and you

521
00:29:59.861 --> 00:30:03.070
assume that rate stayed the same for the whole 12 months.

522
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.020
What would the prepayment percentage be?

523
00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:07.840
That's what the number of measures all the time you see in someone's,

524
00:30:07.841 --> 00:30:09.160
since practically zero,

525
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:13.630
these are prepayments for a mortgage issued in 1986 that had an 8% coupon.

526
00:30:13.631 --> 00:30:18.631
So all basically 1986 mortgages with an 8% coupon issued by Fannie Mae or some

527
00:30:20.891 --> 00:30:25.390
big pool of them anyway,
just to see,
sometimes the prepayments are very low,

528
00:30:25.391 --> 00:30:28.600
sometimes they're incredibly high.
How standing at the bottom,

529
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:30.610
at the back there at an 88 say,

530
00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:34.240
who'd you possibly have predicted that prepayment going forward?
You know,

531
00:30:34.241 --> 00:30:36.250
with the ups and the downs and stuff like that.

532
00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.580
Well you couldn't if he made it unconditional,
but if he made a conditional,

533
00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:41.110
it's not so hard.
Cause,

534
00:30:41.111 --> 00:30:44.560
what do you think happened in [inaudible] 93 that made prepayments go up so
high?

535
00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:46.900
It was interest rates went down,

536
00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:50.110
homeowners at an opportunity to refinance at a lower interest rate.

537
00:30:50.111 --> 00:30:53.080
And we were in a different Morgan.
So of course they did that.
Um,

538
00:30:53.081 --> 00:30:55.270
and and those other months when three payments are very low,

539
00:30:55.271 --> 00:30:58.120
the interest rates were higher.
So,
um,

540
00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:02.150
so clearly there's a connection between,
uh,

541
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:06.040
the mortgage rate you got and your original mortgage and the new rate that you

542
00:31:06.041 --> 00:31:09.970
can refinance into.
And that is part of your conditional prediction.

543
00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:12.760
But another thing that's interesting is,
is burnout.

544
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.760
So if you look at two pools,

545
00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:20.350
both issued in one issued in 95 and one issue to 92.

546
00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.200
And with exactly the same coupons,

547
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:28.350
you'll see that the older one is always prepaying less than the new one.

548
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:32.950
Okay.
At least starting from 95 onwards.

549
00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:37.030
So it's as if the old one burns out.

550
00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.220
Once it has an opportunity to prepay,

551
00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.790
you see a lot of prepayments and then they slow down.
Okay.

552
00:31:42.791 --> 00:31:44.650
So that's another thing people had observed.

553
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:49.950
So you might have thought the standard way of modeling things at that time was

554
00:31:50.021 --> 00:31:52.330
to just do a regression.
You say,

555
00:31:52.331 --> 00:31:57.331
well we figured out that prepayments depend on the new interest rate and how

556
00:31:57.521 --> 00:31:59.380
much more in the money you are.

557
00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.550
And it depends on how long you've been in the money because of the burnouts,

558
00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:04.360
you try to estimate a curve,

559
00:32:04.361 --> 00:32:07.990
like an s curve or something that depends on parameters.
That's you know,

560
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:10.570
on the interest rate and on the burnout,

561
00:32:10.571 --> 00:32:13.000
how long you've been in the money and you know,

562
00:32:13.001 --> 00:32:16.060
according to some parameters that describe the ass and you tried to estimate

563
00:32:16.061 --> 00:32:19.210
those parameters.
So that would be an old fashioned way of measuring things.

564
00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:20.980
But as we're going to see in this course,

565
00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:24.400
we look at everything from an agent based approach.

566
00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:28.030
So what are the individual agents doing?
So I,

567
00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:32.830
so we got the idea or I got the idea of trying to model all you care about is

568
00:32:32.831 --> 00:32:35.800
aggregate prepayments.
You know,
what does the whole cool doing?

569
00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:38.800
But I decided let's try and predict every single homeowner.

570
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:42.980
So let's try and put ourselves in the mind of every homeowner in the country.

571
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:46.280
Why are they prepaying,
are not prepaying?
Well,

572
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.880
they're prepaying if they get an opportunity to save some money.
But you know,

573
00:32:49.881 --> 00:32:54.440
we know from that graph that lots of people,
uh,

574
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:57.710
don't prepay even when there's a tremendous opportunity,

575
00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:02.090
only 60% of the people are prepaying in a whole year.

576
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.960
So that means the whole year goes by and only 60% of them done have prepaid.

577
00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.290
So every month,
you know,
eight or 10% are prepaying.

578
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:11.900
So the other 90% haven't seen their opportunity.

579
00:33:11.901 --> 00:33:13.820
They've missed it or they've waited.

580
00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:17.060
So clearly not everybody jumps at the opportunity.

581
00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:19.040
So it must be that people are different somehow,

582
00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:23.120
even though they have their own exactly the same circumstance in terms of

583
00:33:23.121 --> 00:33:27.110
refinancing.
So,
um,
you have to account for the difference.

584
00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:31.430
So I imagined that different people have different costs of prepaying.
It's,

585
00:33:31.431 --> 00:33:33.230
it's a,
it's a hassle to prepay.

586
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:35.960
Maybe you literally have to pay some money to prepay.

587
00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:38.750
Maybe you have to take a day off from your job.
Um,

588
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:40.400
some people have other things to do.

589
00:33:40.401 --> 00:33:43.160
They're not that alert because they're paying attention to their kids or their

590
00:33:43.161 --> 00:33:44.390
pay attention to their work.

591
00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.110
So not everybody has the same alertness and everyone follows financial matters

592
00:33:48.111 --> 00:33:49.670
as closely as everybody else does.

593
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:54.020
So also over time people are getting more rational.

594
00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:56.930
They're beginning to understand the market and prepaying more and more.

595
00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:00.700
And of course people hear from their friends if their friends are all prepaying,

596
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:03.980
it's more likely that they'll think about it and prepaid themselves.
So I,

597
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:06.590
so I will build a model.

598
00:34:06.591 --> 00:34:10.550
I built a model together with the researchers at kidder Peabody and then later

599
00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:15.560
we built a model of prepayments based on every individual making a different

600
00:34:15.561 --> 00:34:19.280
decision.
So an individual is characterized by his cost and it's alertness.

601
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:22.490
So different individuals have different costs and different alertness.

602
00:34:22.491 --> 00:34:23.870
And by watching how they behave,

603
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:27.470
we can come to guests what the cost and alertness is of each of these people.

604
00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.080
So you see this model

605
00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:35.260
captures all the effects that we talked about already.
If you have,

606
00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:38.810
if you have a pool of people you can,
you can see the,
the,

607
00:34:38.811 --> 00:34:41.060
the vertical is how many people of each type.

608
00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:43.140
So there are different costs and different alertness.

609
00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:47.540
And so at the beginning when you have a new pool,
like on the right,

610
00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:51.800
there are a lot of people and as they get opportunities to refinance,

611
00:34:51.801 --> 00:34:54.140
it's not random people who prepay.

612
00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:58.070
It's the people with the highest alertness and the lowest costs who prepay.

613
00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:00.710
So over time as the pool gets older,

614
00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:03.050
the distribution of people is going to shift.

615
00:35:03.051 --> 00:35:08.051
It's going to be have less hyper alert and low cost people and more high cost

616
00:35:08.481 --> 00:35:11.540
and low alert people.
So that's why the pool is going to slow down.

617
00:35:11.541 --> 00:35:15.740
So burnout is naturally explained by an agent based approach.
So anyway,

618
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:18.980
as we go through the course,
we're going to emphasize this agent based approach.

619
00:35:18.981 --> 00:35:20.480
So building a model like that,

620
00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:24.020
starting in the 1980s and making a conditional prediction,

621
00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:27.140
you can get a fit that looks like this.

622
00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:31.420
So notice you make some gruesome errors like over here.
That was an expensive,
uh,

623
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:35.270
98 97 98 that was an important mistake,

624
00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:39.570
but you can fit this kind of prepayment surprisingly well.

625
00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:44.610
Okay,
so that was the,
my kidder Peabody days.
And I thought,
you know,

626
00:35:44.611 --> 00:35:48.450
my gosh,
we're doing incredibly well.
We're helping the country.

627
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.490
We're doing things on a colossal scale that nobody had ever done before.

628
00:35:53.491 --> 00:35:55.440
I think I may have not emphasized enough.

629
00:35:55.441 --> 00:35:58.950
They kidder Peabody came to dominate this market.

630
00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:02.400
We controlled over 20% of all the issuance.

631
00:36:02.401 --> 00:36:05.250
And remember there were trillions of dollars of things being issued.

632
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:10.320
So this little group of 20 year old kids basically plus me,
the old guy,

633
00:36:10.321 --> 00:36:14.220
and we search.
So then the traders,
they were issuing something,
you know,

634
00:36:14.221 --> 00:36:18.870
on the scale of half a trillion to $1 trillion of these cmos,
these,
these,

635
00:36:18.871 --> 00:36:22.500
these kids in their mid twenties or late twenties.
And I,

636
00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:25.140
and the world seemed to be a better place for it.
And I thought,
my Gosh,

637
00:36:25.141 --> 00:36:29.730
this is an untold story that needs telling and it's an incredible success story.

638
00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:34.290
Well,
things suddenly changed.
And um,

639
00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:38.760
in 1994,
there was a crash.
So this is the first of three crashes.

640
00:36:38.761 --> 00:36:43.560
I've lived throat.
There was a scandal at kidder Peabody,
the Joe jet scandal,

641
00:36:43.561 --> 00:36:45.240
who was a,
a trader,

642
00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:50.280
a government bond trader who was accused of doctoring the books and faking his

643
00:36:51.421 --> 00:36:56.190
big profits.
He'd been kidder Peabody man of the year in 1993.
And then in 1994,

644
00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:57.840
he was,
um,

645
00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:02.010
they decided that all his profits were fictitious and that he doctored the
books.

646
00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.640
And so he was fired,
but he sued Kitter for discrimination.

647
00:37:05.641 --> 00:37:09.330
And it was a tremendous controversy and was in the front pages of the papers for

648
00:37:09.331 --> 00:37:14.250
months on end.
And finally,
uh,
General Electric who owned kidder Peabody,

649
00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:19.530
closed the firm after 135 years,
or I guess 130 129 years,

650
00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:23.970
they closed the firm.
So I had to go back one day to,

651
00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:25.770
from Yale to Qrp body.

652
00:37:25.771 --> 00:37:29.460
And I invited those 75 people and the research department into my office and I

653
00:37:29.461 --> 00:37:31.350
said,
you're fired.

654
00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:35.460
And then I got up and I went to the office next door and somebody said to me,

655
00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:39.870
you're fired.
And so we all fire at each other.
And the entire,

656
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:44.610
130 year old company came to a close.
So,
um,

657
00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:47.110
we,
the,

658
00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:52.120
the head trader a of mortgages and bunch of his top lieutenants decided to form

659
00:37:53.401 --> 00:37:58.230
a hedge fun instead of,
so kidder Peabody got closed.
I've actually sold,

660
00:37:58.231 --> 00:37:58.891
it wasn't closed.

661
00:37:58.891 --> 00:38:03.891
It was sold to Paine Webber and Paine Webber dropped the name kidder Peabody and

662
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:07.830
hired many of the people from kidder Peabody.
Um,
and in fact,

663
00:38:07.831 --> 00:38:09.810
the second tier,

664
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:13.530
the more junior group of mortgage traders at kidder Peabody,

665
00:38:13.531 --> 00:38:15.660
which was the leading mortgage company at the time,

666
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:17.850
they took over the desk at Paine Webber.

667
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.990
And then PaineWebber was bought by UBS and those same guys took over the desk at

668
00:38:21.991 --> 00:38:26.280
UBS.
So the,
the junior crew at kidder Peabody ended up,

669
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:27.960
some of them were Yalies by the way,

670
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:32.430
ended up running the UVS are big part of the UBS mortgage desk.
But in any case,

671
00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:36.130
um,
our mortgage trader,
they had guys and,
uh,

672
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:40.420
decided to form a hedge fund instead of selling though the,
uh,

673
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:44.860
the Cmos,
they would buy the cmos and we called it Ellington,
capital management.

674
00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:49.360
So I was one of six partners.
I was a small partner cause again I stayed at Yale.

675
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:53.650
So this introduces the last player,
the hedge funds.

676
00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:58.240
So what is a hedge fund?
You've heard the name I'm sure a thousand times.

677
00:38:58.241 --> 00:39:02.440
It has a bad name now,
but I,
hedge fund basically means four things.

678
00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.590
It means it's someone who hedges.
Okay.

679
00:39:05.591 --> 00:39:09.760
You don't just buy and hold the thing and hope that the cashflows are good.

680
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:13.510
You try to protect yourself against as many risks as possible.

681
00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.100
Just like I explained,

682
00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:19.030
we were doing it Kitter when we tried to get the same cash flows in every

683
00:39:19.031 --> 00:39:22.210
scenario and we're going to mathematically study that.
The remaining lectures,

684
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.820
but you're trying to hedge,
that's where the name comes from.

685
00:39:24.821 --> 00:39:27.580
So you try and offset as many risks as he can.

686
00:39:27.581 --> 00:39:31.180
Of course you still run some risks,
but your office setting as many as you can.

687
00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:35.320
The second most important thing is most of it's done are a lot of the buying is

688
00:39:35.321 --> 00:39:38.290
done.
Not Most,
but a lot of the buying is done with borrowed money.

689
00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:39.430
That's called leverage.

690
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:42.520
So you don't just take your investor capital and buy some thing.

691
00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:46.060
You take your investor capital,
you borrow some extra money,

692
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.460
and then you buy some stuff and the stuff you buy,

693
00:39:48.461 --> 00:39:52.570
you use as collateral to guarantee that the lenders are gonna get their money

694
00:39:52.571 --> 00:39:53.140
paid back.

695
00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:57.220
So hedge funds generally leverage the third definition of a hedge fund.

696
00:39:57.250 --> 00:40:00.280
Third characteristic is that they're very lightly regulated.

697
00:40:00.281 --> 00:40:03.880
You have to be a sophist.
So what does that mean?
That means that a,
you know,

698
00:40:03.881 --> 00:40:08.881
a broker who sells something has to make sure that the client he's selling to,

699
00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:14.230
uh,
sorry,
the client on behalf of them,
he's buying the broker,

700
00:40:14.231 --> 00:40:16.510
the stockbroker as to make sure that the,

701
00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:19.960
that the purchased item is appropriate for his client.

702
00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:24.880
We have no such obligations.
We can buy and sell.
Uh,
you know,

703
00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:28.630
with anyone we choose on behalf of our,
of our clients.

704
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:31.300
But our clients have to be sophisticated investors.

705
00:40:31.301 --> 00:40:33.880
So we have to vouch that they're sophisticated.
If they have enough money,

706
00:40:33.881 --> 00:40:36.700
like say $5 million to invest in the hedge fund,

707
00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:39.610
they're by definition sophisticated.
And then they don't,

708
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:43.930
the idea is they don't need to be protected by having a broker who's necessarily

709
00:40:43.931 --> 00:40:46.960
watching out for there to see whether an investment is appropriate.

710
00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:49.670
That doesn't mean that we,
uh,
we,

711
00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.450
we tell them what we're investing in and we're,
you know,

712
00:40:52.451 --> 00:40:55.150
of course we're obliged to explain our strategy,

713
00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:59.170
but once they understand our strategy,
we don't have to check every single,

714
00:40:59.350 --> 00:40:59.591
you know,

715
00:40:59.591 --> 00:41:04.591
we don't have to meet the same tests that a simple broker meets on behalf of,

716
00:41:05.201 --> 00:41:09.820
uh,
let's say a retired,
uh,
individual poor retired individuals.

717
00:41:09.821 --> 00:41:11.710
So there's less regulation.

718
00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:16.480
And the fourth characteristic is hedge funds typically charge higher fees.

719
00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.100
So that's what a hedge fund is.
Now,

720
00:41:18.101 --> 00:41:22.960
the first hedge fund was started in the 1940s,
I believe,
by someone named Jones.

721
00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:26.980
And he was a stock picker.
And when he did is instead of picking,
let's say,

722
00:41:26.981 --> 00:41:31.030
the best car company,
which he might've thought was Ford and leaving it at that,

723
00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:32.650
he would try to hedges risk.

724
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:36.590
So he Ford and he'd short all the other car companies.

725
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:41.770
So effectively he wasn't just betting on Ford doing well because he could lose

726
00:41:42.801 --> 00:41:46.070
if the whole economy went badly forward and every other car company would go

727
00:41:46.071 --> 00:41:47.330
badly.
Instead,

728
00:41:47.331 --> 00:41:50.630
he was betting that Ford would do better than the other car companies.

729
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:53.930
So he was concentrating as bet on something.
He understood more.

730
00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.790
You can't be an expert about everything,

731
00:41:55.791 --> 00:42:00.050
presumably was an expert about cars and he knew Ford was better than General

732
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:01.850
Motors.
So that was a Betty wanted to take,

733
00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:05.240
but he didn't want to take a bat on the whole economy doing well or badly.

734
00:42:05.241 --> 00:42:08.010
So that was the beginning of the idea of the,

735
00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:11.210
the hedged a hedged fund.

736
00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:16.600
Now there's so many risks that a car company or any company runs,

737
00:42:16.701 --> 00:42:19.220
you know,
does their president know what he's doing?

738
00:42:19.221 --> 00:42:20.780
Is Detroit going to be a good city?

739
00:42:20.781 --> 00:42:22.790
Is there going to be a change in government regulation?

740
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:25.220
Is some foreign competitor going to appear on the scene?

741
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.410
Is the price of oil suddenly going to change?

742
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:30.140
There are so many things that can go wrong in a company.

743
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:32.540
It really is very hard to hedge.

744
00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:37.580
So hedging really makes much more sense when you can make the problem

745
00:42:37.581 --> 00:42:40.190
mathematical.
We'll see with mortgages,

746
00:42:40.191 --> 00:42:43.550
it really is a mathematical problem to a much greater extent.

747
00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:46.880
So it makes much more sense to hedge and I think it makes much more sense to be

748
00:42:46.881 --> 00:42:49.850
a hedge fund if you're trading in the mortgage market.
And anyway,

749
00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:53.810
that's what I found out when I visited Wall Street in those days.

750
00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:57.410
So what did the hedge fund do instead of creating these cmos,

751
00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:01.370
they hedge fund would buy them and of course by the most complicated one.

752
00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:05.940
So in effect the hedge funds would buy the ones complicated.
Uh,
the,

753
00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:09.620
the residual piece we're talking about and try to hedge that.

754
00:43:09.621 --> 00:43:11.060
So effectively the hedge fund,

755
00:43:11.061 --> 00:43:15.530
by hedging it was really carving up the cashflows of that last piece into

756
00:43:15.531 --> 00:43:19.310
complicated ways and selling them off to stabilize its profits.
So it really,

757
00:43:19.311 --> 00:43:24.311
the hedge fund actually was continuing the work of the Investment Bank of

758
00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:27.950
creating more and more pieces and trying to allocate the risk.

759
00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:32.840
And so the hedge fund is part of the entire operation,
which was making this,

760
00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:35.630
um,
mortgage market behind the scenes.

761
00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:39.470
Make home ownership so much easier and make people,
uh,

762
00:43:39.471 --> 00:43:43.250
and reduce people's risks or so it seemed well,

763
00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:45.873
<v 2>mmm.</v>

764
00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:51.210
<v 0>The hedge fund immediately started off,
we hit,</v>

765
00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:56.170
we had a hard time raising money to begin with cause after all,
um,
you know,

766
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:58.820
Peabody had just gone out of business.
So,

767
00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.750
and not only have we gone out of business,
but you know,

768
00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.010
there was a general crisis at the time,

769
00:44:04.011 --> 00:44:06.530
it wasn't only the trading scandal of Joe jet,

770
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:10.850
but at the same time there was a crisis in the derivatives market because all

771
00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:14.360
these complicated pieces that were being created,
we're money,
you know,

772
00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:16.970
pieces went up and pieces went down.
Of course,

773
00:44:16.971 --> 00:44:18.620
if you didn't know how to hedge your risks,

774
00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.510
you could end up losing a lot of money.

775
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:25.310
So Orange County went bankrupt in 1994.

776
00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:28.880
And what did Orange County do?
They bought a bunch of inverse floaters.

777
00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:31.800
So when the interest rates were going down and the 90s,

778
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.550
they were making a huge amount of money.
And the,
the,
the,

779
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:40.640
the fellow who ran a orange county's a municipal investments was,

780
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.970
was twice municipal investor of the year.
But in 1994,

781
00:44:44.971 --> 00:44:48.000
when everything turned around and interest rates skyrocketed for the year,

782
00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:50.400
his inverse floaters became almost worthless.

783
00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:54.570
And he bankrupted our Orange County.
So we were the,
you know,

784
00:44:54.571 --> 00:44:57.120
it was some of our inverse floaters that were being bought,

785
00:44:57.121 --> 00:45:00.420
which helped bankrupt Orange County plus kidder Peabody had just gone out of

786
00:45:00.421 --> 00:45:03.060
business because of Joe jet.
And,
uh,

787
00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:07.680
so it was very difficult for our hedge fund to raise money.
Uh,
we almost had to,

788
00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:11.730
uh,
our model was we created the mass,
let us clean it up.

789
00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:16.230
And so we nonetheless,
we did raise some money.

790
00:45:16.231 --> 00:45:20.400
We had an important a starting investment from the Ziff brothers and we had an

791
00:45:20.401 --> 00:45:24.420
incredible boom time.
It made fantastic returns.
Our first few years,

792
00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:28.530
50% returns,
and we grew into the biggest,

793
00:45:28.531 --> 00:45:32.550
a hedge fund,
a mortgage hedge fund in the country.

794
00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:37.470
And things were booming along.
And then suddenly there was another crash in 1998.

795
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.500
So this is the second crash that I was exposed to.

796
00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:44.670
So what happened in this crash?
Well,
as I told you,

797
00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:49.730
we were buying mortgages as they hedge fund buying that residual piece.

798
00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:54.390
And buying it by with borrowed money.
So we would buy the piece,
you know,

799
00:45:54.391 --> 00:45:57.180
let's say for a hundred by borrowing $80.

800
00:45:57.181 --> 00:46:01.620
So we use $20 of investor capital,
we buy the other,
we borrow the other 80,

801
00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:03.180
we buy the piece for a hundred,

802
00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.390
and then we leave the piece with the lender as collateral.

803
00:46:06.391 --> 00:46:09.150
So if we didn't pay them back to 80,
the guy could keep our piece.

804
00:46:09.151 --> 00:46:12.060
So his hundred dollar piece was protecting his $80 loan.

805
00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:16.080
So things was,
we're a swimming along.

806
00:46:16.081 --> 00:46:20.560
We're going to talk a lot about leverage later.
Well,
in 1998,
our big,
uh,

807
00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:23.070
one of the big competitors,
longterm capital,

808
00:46:23.071 --> 00:46:27.030
which was founded as I think I've mentioned earlier in the course by,
uh,

809
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:30.900
Mary,
whether who was most important,
a famous,
uh,

810
00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:35.930
fixed income trader on Wall Street from Solomon and two Nobel Prize winners who

811
00:46:35.971 --> 00:46:38.940
I've mentioned many times.
And you're going to hear about again,

812
00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:44.220
Merton and shoals and creators,
uh,
especially shoals of the black Sholes model.

813
00:46:44.221 --> 00:46:49.170
The most important tool on Wall Street for managing risk is we'll discover in a

814
00:46:49.171 --> 00:46:53.760
few lectures.
So these guys,
uh,
the three of them in nine other partners,

815
00:46:53.761 --> 00:46:57.810
12 of them created this wildly successful hedge fund.
And in 1998,

816
00:46:57.811 --> 00:47:00.150
it suddenly went out of business.
And in fact,

817
00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:04.050
the government had to step in with all the big investment banks coordinating the

818
00:47:04.051 --> 00:47:07.680
big investment banks to take it over so that the whole market wouldn't crash

819
00:47:07.681 --> 00:47:08.520
down around it.

820
00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:14.140
We celebrated the crash of a long term capital figuring that was one of our big

821
00:47:16.411 --> 00:47:19.830
competitors out of business.
And now we would have an easier time.

822
00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:24.480
But I remember thinking at the time that was a mistake.
But anyway,

823
00:47:24.481 --> 00:47:26.610
a few months later we got a margin call.

824
00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:31.000
So suddenly on a Friday morning in October of of 98,

825
00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:34.450
somebody,
uh,
one of our lenders called us up and said,

826
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:38.470
we think the prices have gone down.
Uh,
it's not a 100 anymore.

827
00:47:38.471 --> 00:47:39.400
It's less than that.

828
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:44.430
We need x million dollars of extra margin to put a free for us to contribute

829
00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.400
because the hundred dollars piece protecting the $80 loan,

830
00:47:48.401 --> 00:47:51.160
it was no longer a hundred dollars a piece.
It was a lower piece.

831
00:47:51.161 --> 00:47:54.550
So there was less cushion.
We need extra cash to have a bigger cushion.

832
00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:58.360
So we said,
oh,
this is crazy.
The prices haven't gone down that far.

833
00:47:58.361 --> 00:48:00.280
That's not fair.
And they said,

834
00:48:00.281 --> 00:48:03.940
you have till four o'clock Friday afternoon to pay us back.

835
00:48:03.941 --> 00:48:06.490
And if you don't pay us back to him the next business day,

836
00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:10.090
which happened to be Tuesday morning cause it was Columbus Day holiday on
Monday,

837
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:13.930
we'll just sell off all your pieces and pay ourselves back out of the proceeds,

838
00:48:13.931 --> 00:48:17.910
the 80 and gives you whatever's leftover.
When we figured what was left over,

839
00:48:17.911 --> 00:48:20.590
it wasn't going to be very much because they only needed,
they're 80.

840
00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:23.500
So why they didn't have an incentive to sell for the best possible price.

841
00:48:23.501 --> 00:48:26.080
Although of course they would tell us they'd sell for the best possible price.

842
00:48:26.081 --> 00:48:30.280
They probably,
you know,
they wouldn't,
it would be a fire sale.
So we,
we,
we,

843
00:48:30.281 --> 00:48:33.250
we were,
uh,
we didn't know what to do and uh,

844
00:48:33.251 --> 00:48:35.530
we couldn't raise the money by four o'clock on Friday.

845
00:48:35.531 --> 00:48:39.250
So he called up Warren Buffet.
We said,
oh,
this is so unfair.

846
00:48:39.251 --> 00:48:40.270
They're forcing us to sell.

847
00:48:40.271 --> 00:48:43.000
There's no reason why we should have to sell the pre and all this margin call is

848
00:48:43.001 --> 00:48:45.130
not proper.
It's not right.
It almost is,
you know.

849
00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:46.810
[inaudible] there's no reason we have to sell.
I mean,

850
00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:49.930
what's going to happen is on Tuesday we're going to force to sell all our bonds

851
00:48:49.931 --> 00:48:52.630
at the same time.
And they're going all sell for like 80 or something.

852
00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:56.590
Just give be a terrible bloodbath of firesale prices will go for,

853
00:48:56.591 --> 00:49:00.730
nothing will be totally wiped out.
So unfairly.
Why don't you buy our firm,

854
00:49:00.731 --> 00:49:04.330
we'll give you half are half are from,
you know,
some big percentage of our firm.

855
00:49:04.331 --> 00:49:07.240
You just make the margin call for us and then you can have these,

856
00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:10.720
this firm with these great bonds and you know,
there's the,
you know,
you can just,

857
00:49:10.721 --> 00:49:13.810
it's such a travesty and it's going to be such a good investment for you and you

858
00:49:13.811 --> 00:49:17.940
can save us and save the bonds and,
and stop this tragedy.
Travesty.
And,

859
00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:21.350
and he said,
excuse me.
And we said,
well,
you know,
it's unfair.
We're going to,

860
00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:24.160
they're going to force us to sell on Tuesday and the bonds will go for nothing.

861
00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:25.180
And uh,
you know,

862
00:49:25.181 --> 00:49:27.670
when they're perfectly valuable bonds and they're going to wipe us out and you

863
00:49:27.671 --> 00:49:31.960
can prevent that from happening and own our great firm.
And he said,
hell,

864
00:49:31.961 --> 00:49:34.600
I think I'll wait for Tuesday and buy the bonds myself.

865
00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:38.350
And so Warren Buffet didn't rescue us.

866
00:49:38.351 --> 00:49:42.220
And so that Tuesday it looked like we would go out of business,

867
00:49:42.221 --> 00:49:45.760
but over the weekend we managed to,
uh,

868
00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:49.000
hold an auction and sell the bonds ourselves.

869
00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:53.350
So in other classes in economics,
you find out how to conduct auctions.

870
00:49:53.351 --> 00:49:55.450
I don't have time to describe this in great detail,

871
00:49:55.451 --> 00:50:00.451
but let me just say that in a typical auction you have to worry about the

872
00:50:00.641 --> 00:50:03.400
winner's curse.
You know,
everybody's thinking,

873
00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:07.510
I better not be the highest bidder because that means I've probably overpaid

874
00:50:07.511 --> 00:50:11.470
cause he,
those are smart guys are bidding against me.
And so all our bitters,

875
00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:14.800
so what we did over the weekend is we called everybody up and we said,
you know,

876
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:18.280
we've been forced by a margin call to sell these things.

877
00:50:18.281 --> 00:50:19.750
There's going to be a great deal for you.

878
00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:23.230
So why do you come back from your vacation?
One guy came back from Budapest,

879
00:50:23.231 --> 00:50:27.100
one big trader on Wall Street.
We got a huge collection of traders there.

880
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:29.840
The weekend we showed them our bonds so they could think about that.

881
00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:32.270
And on Monday we held our auction,

882
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:34.400
but he didn't sell everything at the same time.

883
00:50:34.401 --> 00:50:38.600
At 12 o'clock we sold the first third of our bonds at two o'clock the second

884
00:50:38.601 --> 00:50:39.290
third,

885
00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:43.430
and at four o'clock the third third actually we got a little behind schedule.

886
00:50:43.431 --> 00:50:44.570
But that was our plan.

887
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:49.990
And so what happened is that 12 o'clock everybody basically bid 80 so we said,

888
00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:56.120
you know,
we're one of the bidders ourselves.
Of course we told everybody,

889
00:50:56.121 --> 00:50:58.700
they all did it by email.
We emailed everybody back.

890
00:50:58.701 --> 00:51:02.060
You've been outbid either by someone else or buy us.
You've been outbid.

891
00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:03.980
So now these guys,
one from Budapest,

892
00:51:03.981 --> 00:51:08.030
one are from all over the world back there thinking we're going out of business

893
00:51:08.031 --> 00:51:12.020
bidding 80 they don't get to buy anything.
So what would they do?
What?
You know,

894
00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:13.610
what are they,
what would they be thinking?

895
00:51:13.611 --> 00:51:16.550
So between 12 and two were on the edge of our seats.

896
00:51:16.551 --> 00:51:17.690
So they going to bid 80 again,

897
00:51:17.691 --> 00:51:20.630
which means of course we get nothing cause we just pay back the loan for 80.

898
00:51:20.631 --> 00:51:24.080
And we go out of business and our investors got a business or they going to

899
00:51:24.081 --> 00:51:27.710
realize that they have to bid more in order to beat some,
you know,
other people.

900
00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:30.470
So we had no idea it was going to happen.
But you know,

901
00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:34.970
the price was basically 95 at two o'clock in 99 at four o'clock.

902
00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:39.500
So we celebrated saving our firm.
And um,

903
00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:44.150
it turned out there was another complication after that,
which I won't get into,

904
00:51:44.151 --> 00:51:47.900
which is that the,
uh,
the thing had happened over the holidays.

905
00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:51.440
And so the next morning,
um,

906
00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:55.840
the buyers,
uh,
didn't get their bonds.

907
00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:57.980
So remember we don't have the bonds to sell them.

908
00:51:57.981 --> 00:51:59.990
They're sitting with the person who lent us the money.

909
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:04.160
So it was all a holiday and the bonds didn't get transferred to the buyers.

910
00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:08.420
And so,
uh,
the prime broker was supposed to vouch for all of this,
you know,

911
00:52:08.421 --> 00:52:11.420
it was a holiday for him too.
And so the whole thing was a mess.

912
00:52:11.421 --> 00:52:15.250
And it's actually quite an amazing story,
which I don't have time to tell.

913
00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:19.820
But anyway,
when the buyers didn't get their bonds the next morning on Tuesday,

914
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.030
they all got alarm that maybe we didn't even have the bonds.

915
00:52:23.031 --> 00:52:27.020
And so everybody made a margin call against us and we went from celebrating to

916
00:52:27.021 --> 00:52:28.850
suddenly thinking we're out of business again.

917
00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:32.300
But sometimes when you're so badly off,

918
00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:34.400
people realize that they have to stop.

919
00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:39.410
And so there was a big conference call on Wednesday in which all our lenders,

920
00:52:39.411 --> 00:52:42.290
the sort of number two people that all the big investment banks got together in

921
00:52:42.291 --> 00:52:43.310
the conference call.

922
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:46.610
And the agreed that if they all tried to get their money back at the same time,

923
00:52:46.611 --> 00:52:47.600
none of them would get it.

924
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:51.980
And so they waited for us to gradually work ourselves out of the predicament.

925
00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:56.690
So we survived the crash of 1998.

926
00:52:56.990 --> 00:53:01.580
And then after that we had another boom year,
an incredible year in 1999.

927
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:06.790
And things kept booming again for eight years or nine years until 2007 when

928
00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:13.250
there was,
uh,
so before I get to that,

929
00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:17.630
that experience was so seared in my mind.
The second crisis,

930
00:53:17.631 --> 00:53:19.130
the 1998 crisis was oh,

931
00:53:19.131 --> 00:53:23.390
seared in my mind that I wrote a paper called the leverage cycle in which I
said,

932
00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:27.900
what basically happens is people borrow a lot of money and they're very

933
00:53:27.901 --> 00:53:28.720
leveraged.

934
00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:33.510
Then something bad happens in the economy and the lenders suddenly reduce the

935
00:53:33.511 --> 00:53:38.170
leverage.
And so the big leverage buyers,
they go out of business,
the,
the,

936
00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:39.810
the,
the leverage goes way down.

937
00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:43.950
Lenders will ask for more collateral and there's also the bad news and those

938
00:53:43.951 --> 00:53:46.230
three things together completely crushed the market.

939
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:49.500
And so lots of people are out of business and the whole thing's a mess.

940
00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:53.010
But then after things settled down,
there's another boom.

941
00:53:53.250 --> 00:53:56.190
So that's what I call and then it's going to repeat itself over and over again.

942
00:53:56.191 --> 00:53:57.780
So that's the leverage cycle story.

943
00:53:57.781 --> 00:54:02.490
I told in 2003 after I wrote it right after the crisis of [inaudible] 98 and I

944
00:54:02.491 --> 00:54:05.340
said that this crisis,
which in 98 seems to be so small,

945
00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:08.550
could repeat it on a much grander scale for the whole economy.

946
00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:14.090
So in we had these boom years right after the crisis of [inaudible] 98 and then

947
00:54:14.221 --> 00:54:18.000
in 2007,
eight there was another crash this time on a grand scale,

948
00:54:18.001 --> 00:54:21.360
but it was exactly the same kind in the last two lectures of this course are

949
00:54:21.361 --> 00:54:23.160
going to be about the most recent crisis.

950
00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:28.110
And so we're going to mathematically reexamined this entire story.
So,

951
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:32.280
um,
and again,
after the 2008 crash,

952
00:54:32.281 --> 00:54:35.880
when we almost went out of business again or a hedge fund in 2009,

953
00:54:35.881 --> 00:54:39.270
we had the best year we've ever had,
better than all those other years,
even in,

954
00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:44.190
in 95.
So we were,
um,
uh,

955
00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:48.690
so three times in a row there's a crash,
a boom,
a crash of boom,
a crash,

956
00:54:48.691 --> 00:54:49.111
and a boom.

957
00:54:49.111 --> 00:54:53.850
We made back more money in 2009 then we'd lost in the crisis of 2007,

958
00:54:53.851 --> 00:54:54.690
2008.

959
00:54:55.140 --> 00:55:00.140
So the course has to end with an explanation of why these cycles happen over and

960
00:55:01.231 --> 00:55:02.730
over again.
It can't be an accident.

961
00:55:02.731 --> 00:55:05.460
I decided can't be all my fault that I've been in three of them.

962
00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:07.800
There's gotta be something systematic going on.

963
00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:11.880
And that's what I've been writing about and what our Howell and the course.

964
00:55:11.881 --> 00:55:13.050
And by the way,
as you'll see,

965
00:55:13.051 --> 00:55:17.850
I spent a lot of time talking to the Federal Reserve and Bernanki and summers

966
00:55:17.851 --> 00:55:22.830
and also at the ECB in a,
the European Central Bank,
uh,

967
00:55:22.831 --> 00:55:25.440
about the levered cycle,
which I think,
you know,

968
00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:29.310
it's generally becoming recognized as a central problem.

969
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:35.000
But I want to end this lecture in the next 15 or so minutes,

970
00:55:35.071 --> 00:55:39.000
20 minutes by pointing out one change in the market,

971
00:55:39.001 --> 00:55:42.840
the next big change in the market,
the next wave of securitization.

972
00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:46.590
Okay.
So this is the subprime market,

973
00:55:46.591 --> 00:55:51.260
which we haven't mentioned yet and which I will now describe.
Um,

974
00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:58.530
Okie and slide show from beginning.

975
00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:02.910
Okay.
So what is the subprime mortgage market?
So we already,

976
00:56:02.911 --> 00:56:07.770
I already pointed out the securitization was a great idea.
Okay,
now it was,

977
00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:11.100
it was applied.
Remember to prime mortgages.

978
00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:15.000
You had to be a very reliable homeowner to get one of those Fannie or Freddie

979
00:56:15.001 --> 00:56:18.390
loans.
And because those people were so reliable,

980
00:56:18.391 --> 00:56:20.390
although they didn't behave perfectly rationally,
you know,

981
00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:25.390
they had cost and alertness issues,
they still were very predictable.
Well,

982
00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:31.590
a combination of things happened in the late nineties is investors began to get

983
00:56:32.771 --> 00:56:33.550
the idea,
you know,

984
00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:37.810
this has worked out so well and there's so many people who don't own homes in

985
00:56:37.811 --> 00:56:39.340
America because they're poor.

986
00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:43.240
Maybe we can extend homeownership to still more people.

987
00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:45.590
Of course they're going to be riskier because they're poor.

988
00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:46.900
They have less resources,

989
00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:49.570
but we'll charge them a higher interest rate and that will,

990
00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:51.940
that will compensate us for the extra risk.

991
00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:56.320
The government also saw this as a great opportunity to help the poor.

992
00:56:56.590 --> 00:57:00.760
So this combination of investor's getting the idea and the government wanting to

993
00:57:00.761 --> 00:57:04.660
sponsor it led to the creation of a new market,
the subprime market,

994
00:57:04.661 --> 00:57:06.370
which is what I'm going to describe now.

995
00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:10.120
And I'm going to talk about what went wrong or begin to talk about what went

996
00:57:10.121 --> 00:57:14.610
wrong,
but I'm going to leave most of it for the last two classes.
So as I said,

997
00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:18.070
securitization is so important because let me remind you,

998
00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:21.420
typically when a bank makes a loan,
um,

999
00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:25.150
the bank finds out a lot of people a lot about who it's lending too.

1000
00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:30.040
But you know,
the bank is not,
the bank has a bunch of managers and stuff.

1001
00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:34.630
The shareholders of the bank or the people whose money is at risk,

1002
00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:38.290
they aren't the ones looking at the loans.
So if you're a shareholder,

1003
00:57:38.291 --> 00:57:41.140
you own stock in a bank,
two years later,

1004
00:57:41.141 --> 00:57:44.500
the bank's going to make a loan to somebody risking your money and you've got no

1005
00:57:44.501 --> 00:57:48.580
idea who the guy is that he's the bank is lending to or what the characteristics

1006
00:57:48.581 --> 00:57:50.380
are.
The of the person who's getting alone.

1007
00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:55.150
Think of the securitization when you're buying a pool,
when you get this pool,

1008
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:57.010
you could be told,
you know,

1009
00:57:57.011 --> 00:57:59.740
what are the characteristics of all the homeowners and the pool.

1010
00:57:59.741 --> 00:58:01.150
It's something very concrete.

1011
00:58:01.151 --> 00:58:05.440
A bank lends to homeowners that lends to businesses is doing 6,000 things.

1012
00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:09.100
Of course it's risky to have bank capital,
you know,

1013
00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:11.530
equity owned shares of the bank because you don't know what they're doing and

1014
00:58:11.531 --> 00:58:14.150
they're doing so many different things.
It's a lot you,

1015
00:58:14.151 --> 00:58:18.550
you should feel a lot more comfortable if where your money is going is very well

1016
00:58:18.551 --> 00:58:21.850
delineated.
And that's the idea of a securitization.
It's very

1017
00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:25.930
well defined where the money's going.

1018
00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:30.970
So it makes people more willing to land.
I mean,
you know the corporate debt,

1019
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.380
that's another way of lending money.
But you know,
if you own bonds and affirm,

1020
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:38.810
you know,
you're not the first person to get paid back.
The,
the,

1021
00:58:38.811 --> 00:58:42.640
the people lending with collateral get their money first and if the firm goes

1022
00:58:42.641 --> 00:58:43.271
bankrupt,
you know,

1023
00:58:43.271 --> 00:58:46.180
there's a big court case and it takes a long time to get your money back,

1024
00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:51.130
not in the securitization.
So there are many ways that a securitization is,

1025
00:58:51.131 --> 00:58:56.020
um,
more,
um,
attractive than lending money through a bank.

1026
00:58:56.290 --> 00:58:58.240
And that's the reason for the securitization.

1027
00:58:58.241 --> 00:59:00.190
So now let here the current numbers,

1028
00:59:00.191 --> 00:59:04.300
the 2007 numbers and there haven't been much securitization since then.

1029
00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:08.290
So the agencies are now up to 4 trillion,
Fannie and Freddie.

1030
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:12.820
Now those jumbo loans I told you about the big loans that the rich people take

1031
00:59:12.821 --> 00:59:16.510
out and remember,
which was point 5 trillion in 2003.

1032
00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:20.620
It's now point 8 trillion.
But there are two more markets that have been created.

1033
00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:22.520
There's the Altais,

1034
00:59:22.521 --> 00:59:25.970
those are people who don't have credit ratings good enough to get the Fannie

1035
00:59:25.971 --> 00:59:28.610
Freddie loans.
That's point 8 trillion.
And then,

1036
00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:30.140
but they're pretty good credit ratings.

1037
00:59:30.141 --> 00:59:34.250
And then the sub prime population of which there were Chilean loans issued by

1038
00:59:34.251 --> 00:59:35.240
2007.

1039
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:40.160
So it's one point 8 trillion of lesser credit loans that didn't exist at all in

1040
00:59:40.161 --> 00:59:43.880
2002.
So,
uh,
you add these numbers up,

1041
00:59:43.881 --> 00:59:48.881
4.8 0.8 and one that's 6.6 and four Chilean of unsecured ties.

1042
00:59:49.131 --> 00:59:52.700
The banks are just holding the loans.
So over 10 trillion of loans,
as I said.

1043
00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:53.661
Okay.

1044
00:59:53.661 --> 00:59:56.720
And then you add the commercials on top of that and you're getting very close to

1045
00:59:56.721 --> 01:00:00.560
the value of the stock market.
So,
um,
all right,

1046
01:00:00.561 --> 01:00:03.500
so we've talked about this,
you know,

1047
01:00:03.501 --> 01:00:08.330
the advantages of a securitized loans.
You,
you know,
you,
okay,

1048
01:00:08.331 --> 01:00:13.260
so we've talked about all this.
So now,
um,
I went through that.
So,

1049
01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:18.140
all right.
Uh,
all right.
So how did the subprime market begin?

1050
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:21.170
Well,
you had to have a few legal hurdles.
The first one,

1051
01:00:21.171 --> 01:00:23.270
which some countries haven't managed to,

1052
01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:26.750
to achieve and some people now are doubting we should have ever done is,

1053
01:00:26.751 --> 01:00:27.290
you know,

1054
01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:31.010
is it legal to charge a high interest rate to someone just because they're

1055
01:00:31.310 --> 01:00:31.851
riskier?

1056
01:00:31.851 --> 01:00:36.560
Is that usury or is that a reasonable return because you're making a bigger
risk.

1057
01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:40.910
So,
you know,
they're anti usury laws,
uh,
on the books.

1058
01:00:40.911 --> 01:00:44.150
And so in order to make these loans,
you had to get,
uh,

1059
01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:45.410
they had to become legalized.

1060
01:00:45.411 --> 01:00:49.040
You had to get Congress to pass a law to say that higher interest rate loans for

1061
01:00:49.041 --> 01:00:52.070
riskier people is not usury.
Okay.

1062
01:00:52.071 --> 01:00:55.370
So then you also had to figure out the tax treatment,

1063
01:00:55.371 --> 01:01:00.371
which happened in 1986 and so the first pools were created in the late eighties

1064
01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:03.230
early nineties and kidder Peabody,
by the way,

1065
01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:07.880
that firms I worked for a member at exactly that time was one of the first

1066
01:01:07.881 --> 01:01:10.670
creators of these subprime like loans.

1067
01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:14.600
So it was very small in the early days and it worked pretty well in the early

1068
01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:15.920
days.
And as I said,

1069
01:01:15.921 --> 01:01:20.921
by FY 2007 it had grown to 1,000,000,000,005 million people that an average loan

1070
01:01:21.021 --> 01:01:24.170
of $200,000 okay.
Now,

1071
01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:27.460
these are people who,
as I said,

1072
01:01:27.461 --> 01:01:31.820
I have bad credit ratings and so they pay a higher interest rate instead of say

1073
01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:34.940
6% at the time they might or 5% at the time,

1074
01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:37.520
they might pay five or 6% the mortgage rate at that time,

1075
01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:42.020
they might pay 8% for the first two years and then at the end of the first two

1076
01:01:42.021 --> 01:01:47.021
years the rate jumps up by another 3% maybe to live or plus 6% library remembers

1077
01:01:48.021 --> 01:01:49.640
the inner bank interest rate,

1078
01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:53.870
so it's already high and then it jumps up after a couple of years.
Now,

1079
01:01:53.871 --> 01:01:58.730
many people have said this is a kind of a predatory lending that the homeowners

1080
01:01:58.731 --> 01:02:01.400
being lured into taking out a loan,

1081
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:04.910
not realizing that a couple of years the prey rate is going to go way up.

1082
01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:09.830
But actually there's some rationale to this is it turns out that if you've made

1083
01:02:09.831 --> 01:02:13.340
your payment for two or three consecutive years,

1084
01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:17.060
the market thinks you're not such a subprime person anymore after all,

1085
01:02:17.061 --> 01:02:20.040
many subprime borrowers are who are young.

1086
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:24.690
They didn't pay their credit cards in college or they defaulted on something and

1087
01:02:24.691 --> 01:02:27.120
once they're married,
have a house,
have kids,

1088
01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:30.840
and they pay for three consecutive years.
The market figures,
while these people,

1089
01:02:30.841 --> 01:02:34.380
you know,
they're much better.
So we're,
we're going to get,

1090
01:02:34.381 --> 01:02:35.820
we'll give them another law.

1091
01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:39.090
They could refinance into a loan with a lower interest rate because they're no

1092
01:02:39.091 --> 01:02:43.260
longer considered subprime.
Maybe they move to all day or MEVV into prime.

1093
01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:48.650
So you could count on 70% by the end of the third year of people refinancing

1094
01:02:49.831 --> 01:02:54.831
their loan during all those years from the nineties and early two thousands so

1095
01:02:54.871 --> 01:02:57.720
you'd be left with 30% of the people who didn't refinance.

1096
01:02:57.721 --> 01:02:59.070
Why didn't they refinance?

1097
01:02:59.071 --> 01:03:00.480
Probably cause there there's something wrong with them.

1098
01:03:00.481 --> 01:03:01.680
And they were missing their loans.

1099
01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:04.830
They were much riskier than the original pool to begin with.

1100
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:07.140
So naturally you're going to charge them a higher interest rate.

1101
01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:10.830
So it's not such a crazy thing that the interest rate went up after two years.

1102
01:03:10.831 --> 01:03:14.220
It does necessarily a sign of predatory lending.
Okay.

1103
01:03:14.221 --> 01:03:18.690
Now how do these loans get started?
Whether somebody called an originator?
Okay.

1104
01:03:18.691 --> 01:03:23.010
So a broker would find a homeowner,
a subprime homeowner,

1105
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:27.270
and then go to an originator who would create the deal.
Okay.

1106
01:03:27.271 --> 01:03:31.950
Now what would the pool,
what would the deal be?
The Pool,
uh,
would,

1107
01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:35.940
uh,
be a bunch of sub prime homeowners and you'd have to get some data on the

1108
01:03:35.941 --> 01:03:39.240
people.
You don't have to figure out do they have a job,
what's their debt,
what's,

1109
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:41.760
you know,
their income,
things like that.

1110
01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:45.300
And all that would have to be reported to the potential buyers.

1111
01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:49.770
So a buyer in the shares of these subprime pools,
we'd get a list,

1112
01:03:50.010 --> 01:03:52.560
not by name,
you can't reveal the name of the homeowners,

1113
01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:57.420
but what the zip code is of every house and what the basic qualifications were

1114
01:03:57.421 --> 01:03:59.220
of the homeowner.
You know,
do they have a job,

1115
01:03:59.221 --> 01:04:02.580
what's the loan to value on the loan,
what's their debt to income ratio,

1116
01:04:02.581 --> 01:04:05.640
stuff like that.
Okay.
Now,
um,

1117
01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:09.990
the servicer who is often the originator,
let's say the servicers,

1118
01:04:09.991 --> 01:04:10.980
an investment bank,

1119
01:04:11.290 --> 01:04:15.480
the originators and investment bank or the servicer might be the same investment

1120
01:04:15.481 --> 01:04:20.120
bank or a specialty servicer.
What they do is just with the,
the,

1121
01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:23.910
the banks did in the Fannie Freddie story,
they're the ones sending the letters,

1122
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:28.580
telling people they have to pay,
collecting the money and dividing it up,
uh,
to,

1123
01:04:28.650 --> 01:04:33.210
to the bond holders while describe in a second.
And they are,
um,

1124
01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:38.730
they have one extra job because it's their subprime loans.

1125
01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:42.000
You can expect a bigger percentage of them to default.

1126
01:04:42.450 --> 01:04:45.690
And when people default,
you know,
sometimes they can't make the payments,

1127
01:04:45.691 --> 01:04:47.490
they lose their jobs,
something like that.

1128
01:04:47.491 --> 01:04:51.990
The servicers given the right to modify,
the loan servicer can say,
okay,

1129
01:04:51.991 --> 01:04:55.500
I understand you can't pay.
Of course you can't pay.
You're out of a job,

1130
01:04:55.501 --> 01:04:56.400
you don't have any money,

1131
01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:59.100
there's no point in us throwing you out of the house right away.

1132
01:04:59.101 --> 01:05:00.390
Maybe you'll get the job back.

1133
01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:04.740
So we'll work out a deal where we delay your payments or maybe we reduce the

1134
01:05:04.741 --> 01:05:08.880
payments.
Maybe even we reduced the principal that you owe.
Um,

1135
01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:12.650
cause in the end that's going to make our bond holders more money.
So the,

1136
01:05:12.651 --> 01:05:15.900
all the bond holders have no right to talk to the homeowner.

1137
01:05:15.901 --> 01:05:17.440
They don't know even know the homeowner's name,

1138
01:05:17.441 --> 01:05:20.140
but the servicer who sending the homeowner letters all the time and getting the

1139
01:05:20.141 --> 01:05:20.321
money,

1140
01:05:20.321 --> 01:05:23.800
of course the service or knows the name and has the right to modify the loan.

1141
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:28.230
And if the homeowner doesn't pay and the Malones not modified cause the servicer

1142
01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.740
doesn't think it's worth it,
then the home,
the,

1143
01:05:30.741 --> 01:05:35.380
the servicer can kick the homeowner out of his house and take the house and sell

1144
01:05:35.381 --> 01:05:38.860
it and pay the proceeds to the fun.

1145
01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:44.070
But there's one extremely interesting a provision that if the is not pain during

1146
01:05:45.131 --> 01:05:46.540
the time the homeowner doesn't pay,

1147
01:05:46.541 --> 01:05:51.340
the servicer has to make the payments for the homeowner into the trust for the

1148
01:05:51.341 --> 01:05:55.120
bond holders that's supposed to give the in the service or an incentive to hurry

1149
01:05:55.121 --> 01:05:58.810
up and figure out what to do to change the loan or thrill the servicer that

1150
01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:02.560
throw the homeowner out.
And of course,
when the house is finally sold,

1151
01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:07.690
the servicer can recoup his advanced payments out of the proceeds of the sale.

1152
01:06:07.810 --> 01:06:12.310
And then later the rest of the money goes to the,
to the,
to the bond holders.

1153
01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:15.220
Okay.
So,
uh,

1154
01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:19.810
now the rating agencies played an important role in determining the ratings than

1155
01:06:19.811 --> 01:06:24.130
I'm about to describe.
So here's how the thing would look.
You'd have all the,

1156
01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:28.600
the homeowner's stuck into a pool,
all those loans.
Okay.

1157
01:06:28.601 --> 01:06:31.630
And then you'd,
uh,
I'm going to go for 10 more minutes.
By the way,

1158
01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:35.890
you have all these loans stuck in a,
in a pool.
So the money would be coming in.

1159
01:06:35.891 --> 01:06:36.400
The homeowner's,

1160
01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:40.180
remember a paying this high interest rate because they're subprime borrowers.

1161
01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:44.380
So there's $100 of loans that went out.
Let's say each loan is for a dollar.

1162
01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:48.580
Now the bar,
where does the originator get the money to lend to the homeowners?

1163
01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:51.430
Will the originators at the same time creating the bonds?

1164
01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:55.210
So there's be triple a bonds,
AA,
AA,
triple B,
you know,

1165
01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:59.530
with a bunch of minuses to the overcollateralization and the residual.

1166
01:06:59.770 --> 01:07:02.830
So you'd create $81 of triple a bonds.

1167
01:07:02.831 --> 01:07:06.940
These guys would pay that library bore,
you know,
the interbank rate,

1168
01:07:06.941 --> 01:07:10.900
which let's say it was 5% puts a tiny bit,
20 basis points.

1169
01:07:10.901 --> 01:07:15.610
So 5.2% the AA would pay a little bit more than that.

1170
01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:17.500
And the single AI a little bit more than that,

1171
01:07:17.501 --> 01:07:18.910
maybe that that's probably a misprint.

1172
01:07:18.911 --> 01:07:22.330
That should be library plus 10 library plus 20 library plus 30 and then the

1173
01:07:22.331 --> 01:07:27.331
triple B's live plus 130 so the issue $81 worth of triple A's,

1174
01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:32.890
seven of double A's,
five of A's,
five of triple B's,

1175
01:07:32.891 --> 01:07:36.550
that adds up to 88 93 98 okay,

1176
01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:39.520
so you're only getting $98 now.

1177
01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.850
So you've got $98 worth of bonds that you've issued.

1178
01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:47.850
So the originator has sold these bonds for $98 he's got a land,

1179
01:07:47.891 --> 01:07:52.660
$100 so he's $2 shorts so far.
But you notice that the interest rate,

1180
01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:57.010
all these bond holders are getting it's,
you know,
5% or a little bit more.

1181
01:07:57.011 --> 01:08:00.940
The homeowners are paying 8% so there's extra money coming in that doesn't have

1182
01:08:00.941 --> 01:08:02.410
to go to the bond holders.

1183
01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:07.660
So there's this residual piece that gets the right to get the extra interest

1184
01:08:07.661 --> 01:08:08.380
payments.

1185
01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:12.730
So the originator either holds the residual piece or find some hedge fund and

1186
01:08:12.731 --> 01:08:15.010
says,
okay,
you buy the residual piece,

1187
01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.900
and maybe the residual piece is worth five.

1188
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:20.600
So 98 plus five is $103.

1189
01:08:20.601 --> 01:08:24.980
So the originators gotten $103 the broker's fees,
remember,

1190
01:08:24.981 --> 01:08:29.240
the broker had defined,
the homeowners get to,
so now he's only got $101.

1191
01:08:29.241 --> 01:08:33.950
So he lends the hundred and pockets one.
So the originator would get 1% bear,

1192
01:08:33.951 --> 01:08:37.430
no risk for his work in creating the deal.
Now,

1193
01:08:37.431 --> 01:08:42.200
how could these AAA pieces be rated AAA?
Okay.
Now,

1194
01:08:42.201 --> 01:08:45.260
to be rated AAA means,
you know,
there's a one in a hundred chance.

1195
01:08:45.261 --> 01:08:49.760
There's something that you're going to default.
So how could that possibly,

1196
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:50.833
uh,

1197
01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:56.180
how could that possibly be when the loans are so risky?
Well,

1198
01:08:56.210 --> 01:09:00.500
what happens if somebody defaults?
Um,
okay,

1199
01:09:00.501 --> 01:09:04.910
so this is the calculation.
What happens if somebody's,
uh,

1200
01:09:04.970 --> 01:09:09.680
defaults?
Well,
if you haven't paid for the first 30 days,

1201
01:09:09.930 --> 01:09:14.720
um,
that happens quite often.
But if you go 60 days without paying,

1202
01:09:14.721 --> 01:09:18.110
nothing bad happens to you after 60 days.
You're,
you're,

1203
01:09:18.111 --> 01:09:21.380
you got a letter saying you're delinquent and the,
your,
you know,

1204
01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:25.160
a letters being sent to the,
to your credit,
a,
you know,
a,

1205
01:09:25.190 --> 01:09:29.150
a note as being made that's going to have an impact on your credit score.

1206
01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:32.660
So being 60 days delinquent,
seriously delinquent is bad for the,

1207
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:37.400
for the homeowner.
After 90 days,
you're considered likely to default.

1208
01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:40.790
And so you get these very threatening letters from the servicer and after 100

1209
01:09:40.791 --> 01:09:43.850
days,
the service,
you can start to try and throw you out of the house,

1210
01:09:43.851 --> 01:09:46.010
but to throw you out of the house,
maybe they have to go to court,

1211
01:09:46.011 --> 01:09:49.910
they have to do a whole bunch of things.
And so in those days it took 18 months,

1212
01:09:50.090 --> 01:09:54.440
14 more months after the four already to throw somebody out.
Okay.

1213
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:57.770
And it now has taken,
on average a couple of years or three years,

1214
01:09:57.771 --> 01:10:00.140
it's getting more and more complicated to throw somebody out,

1215
01:10:00.141 --> 01:10:04.890
which we're going to get to in a minute.
So,
um,
uh,
so,
uh,

1216
01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:09.650
so anyway,
you can be thrown out after,
uh,
you know,
say 18 months.
Now,

1217
01:10:09.651 --> 01:10:11.780
what happens if you're thrown out of the house?

1218
01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:15.020
Let's say the house is sold for 80 cents.
Okay?
When you are,

1219
01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:19.090
when you originally had,
um,
a hundred,

1220
01:10:19.190 --> 01:10:21.500
a $1 loan,
well,

1221
01:10:21.710 --> 01:10:24.860
during the time the guy hasn't paid for that year and a half,

1222
01:10:24.861 --> 01:10:26.900
it was if it was an 8% coupon,

1223
01:10:26.901 --> 01:10:31.280
that means a year and a half is 12% so 12 cents the guy hasn't paid.

1224
01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:35.390
So the services had to pay up the 12 cents and then you have to hire a broker to

1225
01:10:35.391 --> 01:10:37.820
resell the house.
That costs six more sense.

1226
01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:41.150
And the guy probably didn't pay his taxes for the whole year and a half.

1227
01:10:41.151 --> 01:10:44.570
So that's another 3 cents or so that you've lost depending on what the tax rate

1228
01:10:44.571 --> 01:10:49.310
is.
So you've lost 12 cents of service or advances 6 cents to the broker.

1229
01:10:49.311 --> 01:10:54.140
That's 18 3 cents.
Uh,
for the,
uh,
taxes,
that's 21 cents.

1230
01:10:54.141 --> 01:10:56.510
And then the house only sold for 80 instead of 100.

1231
01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:58.850
That's 41 cents you've already lost.

1232
01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:03.830
So that's a sort of good scenario.
You've already lost 40%.

1233
01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:05.200
So the,
the,

1234
01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:10.240
the bond holders know that with this scenario they're going to lose 40% about of

1235
01:11:11.631 --> 01:11:15.270
their loan.
Now where does 40% is 40 cents.

1236
01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:18.660
Cause remember there's only $1 loan to that guy.
Where does that come out of?

1237
01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:23.850
Well there was this overcollateralization of $2.
Okay?

1238
01:11:23.851 --> 01:11:28.090
There's this extra money pouring into the deal because there everyone else

1239
01:11:28.091 --> 01:11:29.520
else's paying a higher coupon.

1240
01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:32.630
So you take the money out of the overcollateralization,
uh,

1241
01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:36.930
over out of this extra cash flow that's coming in.
And if the default,

1242
01:11:36.931 --> 01:11:40.680
the last 40 cents is more than the extra cashflow coming in that year,

1243
01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:45.550
then you reduce the overcollateralization.
You know,
there was $2 that um,

1244
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:50.910
these bondholders rolling owed 98 and there's $100 of loans outstanding.

1245
01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:56.060
So you could lose $2 of loans and still have as much loans backing these bond

1246
01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:58.710
holders.
But once you get to the next dollar,

1247
01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:02.940
you're going to take the 40 cents first out of the triple bead piece.
Okay.

1248
01:12:02.941 --> 01:12:06.330
So as war and more houses go under you,
you,

1249
01:12:06.331 --> 01:12:08.970
you go through the overcollateralization,
the extra interest,

1250
01:12:09.090 --> 01:12:12.990
then you start taking things out of the triple bps.
After you wipe out that,

1251
01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:14.870
that wiped that out,
then you go to the aps,

1252
01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:17.130
then the AA and finally go to the AAA.

1253
01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:22.290
So how could you possibly think those pieces at the top?
We're a triple A's.

1254
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:25.920
Well,
because let's,
let's do a simple calculation.
Actually,

1255
01:12:25.921 --> 01:12:29.610
they look incredibly safe when you start to think about it.
Um,

1256
01:12:30.210 --> 01:12:30.931
you know,

1257
01:12:30.931 --> 01:12:34.590
all this extra interest and the overcollateralization and stuff like that is

1258
01:12:34.591 --> 01:12:38.600
sort of 8% protection.
Okay.
And on top of that,
uh,

1259
01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:42.660
you've got the lower pieces bearing,
uh,
the original losses.

1260
01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:47.550
So,
um,
uh,
let's see where I,

1261
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:49.050
uh,
okay,

1262
01:12:49.051 --> 01:12:54.051
so even if you expected a 40% of the homeowners to default,

1263
01:12:55.741 --> 01:12:59.970
which is an astronomical figure,
you know,
it was on,
it was typically in the past,

1264
01:12:59.971 --> 01:13:02.040
you know,
less than a few percent.

1265
01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:05.100
Even if you thought 40% of the homeowners are going to be thrown out of their

1266
01:13:05.101 --> 01:13:10.101
houses and 40% of each homeowner was going to be lost in the scenario we just

1267
01:13:10.201 --> 01:13:11.790
described a 40 cent loss,

1268
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.000
40% times 40% is only six 16% but the AAA pieces are protected by 8% and then

1269
01:13:19.231 --> 01:13:22.800
they're protected by another 19% cause they're only the top 81.

1270
01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:27.120
So 16% doesn't come anywhere close to the AAA guys.

1271
01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:32.330
So that in 2007 was a horrible scenario to imagine that 40% of the homeowners,

1272
01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.950
you know,
there are 5 million homeowners,

1273
01:13:34.951 --> 01:13:37.800
that means 2 million people tossed under the streets,

1274
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:42.660
losing 40% of each of the homes and you don't come close to touching the triple

1275
01:13:42.661 --> 01:13:43.230
A's.

1276
01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:46.490
That's why it seemed like they should be triple A's and why so many people were

1277
01:13:46.491 --> 01:13:51.320
willing to buy them.
Okay.
So one more,
uh,
I,

1278
01:13:51.321 --> 01:13:54.940
I got one more thing to add to this background piece.
The Cra,

1279
01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:59.220
the credit default swap.
And by the way,
things are even rosier than that.

1280
01:13:59.370 --> 01:14:04.370
Leaks looked at from the point of view of 2007 cause remember 70% of the people

1281
01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:08.280
were always prepaying.
That means you've got 70% of your money back for sure.

1282
01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:13.330
So you only had 30% of the people left who could possibly default.
And here,

1283
01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:16.730
you know,
so instead of having 40% default,

1284
01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:21.460
you probably have 40% of the 30% so you see there you could easily imagine that

1285
01:14:21.461 --> 01:14:24.360
your triple A's were completely safe.
Um,

1286
01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:28.480
and so I think the credit rating agencies didn't do such a horrible thing rating

1287
01:14:28.481 --> 01:14:31.840
these things as people say.
But I haven't finished the story.

1288
01:14:31.841 --> 01:14:33.370
So watch what happens.

1289
01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:38.820
So a new invention that happened in the end of 2005 was the credit default swap

1290
01:14:39.191 --> 01:14:44.080
cds.
They're called,
which you've heard a lot.
So what is a credit default swap?

1291
01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:47.350
So it's just insurance on each of these bonds.

1292
01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:51.910
So a credit default swap on the triple B would say if there's a dollar of

1293
01:14:51.911 --> 01:14:53.470
principal lost,
you know,

1294
01:14:53.471 --> 01:14:56.680
because the homeowner's default and you take the loss out of the triple B,

1295
01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:02.100
you can get insurance on the triple B.
This is a cds,

1296
01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:06.160
just is a promise to pay a dollar for every dollar that's lost in the triple B.

1297
01:15:06.370 --> 01:15:10.000
And the cvs on the AA is a promise to pay a dollar for every dollar that's lost

1298
01:15:10.001 --> 01:15:14.710
on the single way.
So,
um,
that was a huge market.

1299
01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:17.800
It suddenly took off in 2005.
Okay.

1300
01:15:17.801 --> 01:15:20.710
And then there was an index that was created in 2006.

1301
01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:23.920
So these are insurance on particular deals,

1302
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:25.870
but if you put all the insurance together,

1303
01:15:25.871 --> 01:15:27.970
you can make an index of what the insurance is like.

1304
01:15:27.971 --> 01:15:31.840
And so you can tell how valuable the,
the,
the bonds are.

1305
01:15:31.841 --> 01:15:34.510
Because if you see that the insurance premium is changing,

1306
01:15:34.511 --> 01:15:37.990
you know that people realize there's a bigger default of a chance of default to

1307
01:15:37.991 --> 01:15:40.210
the triple B.
So the insurance market,

1308
01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:44.590
the index of it is going to tell you a lot of information about what happened to

1309
01:15:44.591 --> 01:15:48.100
the,
what's going on in the sub prime world.
Okay?

1310
01:15:48.130 --> 01:15:52.540
Now I don't have time to get to these legal issues,
but I want to add the last,

1311
01:15:52.570 --> 01:15:54.220
uh,
the last fact.

1312
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:58.060
Things seem to be going so well in the subprime world.
You know,

1313
01:15:58.061 --> 01:16:01.750
from the late eighties,
early nineties,
all through 2000,
all through the middle,

1314
01:16:01.751 --> 01:16:06.130
two thousands that people got more ambitious still.
So what did they do?

1315
01:16:06.131 --> 01:16:09.550
They created CDOs.
So what our CDOS,
now

1316
01:16:11.170 --> 01:16:16.150
remember we had these loans that got cut up into bonds and there was insurance

1317
01:16:16.151 --> 01:16:20.740
in the bonds.
So people said,
let's take the triple B bonds.
Okay?

1318
01:16:20.741 --> 01:16:22.960
They're sort of at the bottom and they're protected a little bit,

1319
01:16:22.961 --> 01:16:27.210
but near the bottom.
And let's cut those up into different pieces.
Okay?
Tea.

1320
01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:31.630
So we take triple B bonds from all different deals.

1321
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:36.190
We put those into another pool and now we cut those into different pieces.

1322
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:40.870
Okay?
And so you might have the pool that's from California in a pool that's from

1323
01:16:40.871 --> 01:16:42.520
Detroit and a pool that's from Florida.

1324
01:16:42.521 --> 01:16:45.030
That would just be a horrible combination or a pool that's familiar,

1325
01:16:45.031 --> 01:16:48.260
and Illinois and Ohio and stuff like that.
And you put them all together.

1326
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:52.960
And now the,
somehow the market decided that we could cut these into triple A's,

1327
01:16:52.961 --> 01:16:56.870
double A's and A's with the same logic as before.
Um,

1328
01:16:57.220 --> 01:17:01.060
but this turned out to be a catastrophic,
uh,
in fact,

1329
01:17:01.061 --> 01:17:05.080
the market went one step further and not only took the triple B's that we said

1330
01:17:05.081 --> 01:17:10.010
before and cut them,
made them collateral for more triple a bonds,
CTOs,

1331
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:12.290
but then took the single A's from this,

1332
01:17:12.291 --> 01:17:16.550
which came from the triple B's and cut those up into more triple A's,
CDO,

1333
01:17:16.551 --> 01:17:20.510
squareds.
So that was the,
that was the mortgage market.

1334
01:17:20.511 --> 01:17:22.490
So the subprime mortgage market.

1335
01:17:22.491 --> 01:17:27.491
So you see that there's a tremendous amount of synthetic stuff.

1336
01:17:27.591 --> 01:17:31.070
Oh,
and by the way,
these insurance pieces,
if you're writing insurance,

1337
01:17:31.071 --> 01:17:34.310
you're promising to pay basically what the triple B's pay.

1338
01:17:34.490 --> 01:17:38.300
So it's like an artificial triple bs.
So they created a,

1339
01:17:38.301 --> 01:17:42.500
the synthetic triple B's and use those to cut up to in the CDO market.

1340
01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:47.860
Okay.
So I'm,
I'm,
I'm going to stop now,
uh,

1341
01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:49.520
with one final word.

1342
01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:54.700
So this sub subprime market of 1 trillion plus the all day market became the new

1343
01:17:56.181 --> 01:17:58.430
frontier of mortgages.
And as I said,

1344
01:17:58.431 --> 01:18:03.170
everything went swimmingly in the 1990s and the early two thousands and then in

1345
01:18:03.171 --> 01:18:05.870
2007 there was a tremendous crash.

1346
01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:11.050
So in January of 2007 February of 2007 the triple B insurance index plummeted

1347
01:18:12.531 --> 01:18:15.740
from 100 to 75 at that point,

1348
01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:19.640
everyone declared all this is just the subprime market.
It's a small thing,

1349
01:18:19.641 --> 01:18:22.010
don't worry about it.
Bernanki said there's no problem.

1350
01:18:22.011 --> 01:18:24.170
The stock market didn't blip it all.

1351
01:18:24.171 --> 01:18:27.740
It continued on until October of 2007 when it is high,

1352
01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:30.710
the world took notice of the subprime collapse,

1353
01:18:30.890 --> 01:18:33.860
but everybody said it wouldn't amount to anything because everybody

1354
01:18:33.861 --> 01:18:36.170
underestimated the importance of the mortgage market.

1355
01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:40.220
So we're going to see in the last two lectures how this unraveling of the

1356
01:18:40.221 --> 01:18:44.060
subprime market led to the unraveling of the entire economy.

1357
01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.970
And we're going to show that everything that I've described,

1358
01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:50.570
although it sounds very much more complicated with subprimes than it did with

1359
01:18:50.571 --> 01:18:54.020
the prime mortgages earlier,
is really when you get down to it,

1360
01:18:54.170 --> 01:18:59.170
the same story of leverage and crashes and then booms.

1361
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:01.370
And,
uh,

1362
01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:04.970
we're going to begin the next class by talking about the mathematics of the

1363
01:19:04.971 --> 01:19:07.970
prime mortgage market and prepayments and how to value those.

1364
01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:12.320
And gradually we're going to get to the crisis and what caused it and what we

1365
01:19:12.321 --> 01:19:16.430
should do to prevent future crisis.
Thanks.
