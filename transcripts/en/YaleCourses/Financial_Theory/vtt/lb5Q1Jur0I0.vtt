1
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.350
So I'm going to talk about what led up to the crisis and how the crisis makes us

2
00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:10.500
realize that the things about the theory that we've been learning all semester,

3
00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:12.000
that ought to be slightly different.

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.110
And I've been working on a new version of a theory for the last 10 years,

5
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.060
what I call the leverage cycle,

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.810
which I have to say didn't get very much attention 10 years ago,

7
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:25.880
but which now seems to be uh,
Eh,

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.950
I don't know,
it seems to be getting more attention.

9
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:32.400
It's almost like a life imitated art really.

10
00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:37.401
It couldn't have turned out more like the theory then I would have expected.

11
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:39.480
But um,

12
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.770
so I'm going to tell you the facts and then try to fit a theory to it and

13
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:46.470
probably will spill over until Thursday.

14
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.980
I think Thursday I won't spend that much time finishing.

15
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.270
W I'll have a review class if anyone's interested for the,
the whole material.

16
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.520
And I think when you see the critique of the theory,

17
00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:59.240
it might help put the theory in a little bit more perspective.
But anyway,

18
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.230
nothing of what I say these last two days,

19
00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:03.210
you should feel it's going to be on the exam.

20
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:06.300
It's just a more information that you might find interesting.

21
00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:11.170
So we talked last time,
remember at one of those special classes about,
uh,

22
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.990
the subprime mortgage market and the idea was that you would pull together a

23
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:19.890
bunch of loans.
These are the,
uh,
uh,
I can do this.

24
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:24.150
I guess you'd pull together a bunch of individual mortgages like this and then

25
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.110
you'd put them in a giant pool and then cut the pool up into a AAA bond,

26
00:01:28.111 --> 00:01:30.720
a double a bond,
a single,
a bond,
a triple B bond.

27
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.570
And this is the overcollateralization and the residual,

28
00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:35.280
and I'm not going to go through the whole structure,

29
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:39.150
but suffice it to say that the idea of this is you take individual loans,

30
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:42.090
which are very risky after all these are subprime borrowers.

31
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.800
So everyone knew that they were risky and you create what's supposed to be an

32
00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:48.420
incredibly safe bond.

33
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:53.421
The definition of AAA bond is that it has a one and 10,000 chance of going

34
00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:57.270
bankrupt in 10 years of losing any principal in 10 years.

35
00:01:57.271 --> 00:01:59.490
That was the definition they claimed.

36
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.410
I heard a talk about power failures last night,
by the way,
and the power grid,

37
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:09.411
which went out all across from Cleveland to a Manhattan in 2003 and they said

38
00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:13.200
that was an event that should happen once every 10 years.

39
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.720
And then when you hear what happened in the event,
you know,
the,

40
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.160
someone didn't trim a tree and the,
the,
the line sagged into the tree.

41
00:02:20.161 --> 00:02:22.980
And so then it shut itself off.
And then a city next door,

42
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:26.310
they had the same problem with someone not trimming a tree in that line shut
off.

43
00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:28.140
And once you have two or three lines shut off,

44
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.290
the system automatically goes down.
You know,

45
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:34.020
it seems like it could happen much more often than once every 10 years.

46
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:35.940
But anyway,
it's the same.
Same thing here.

47
00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:39.810
This is supposed to be once every 10 years,
one in 10,000 chance.

48
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.430
And it happened in a giant way.
So the idea of the AAA,

49
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.150
so there's supposed to be very safe because if the first house,
uh,

50
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.400
defaults,
the first homeowner defaults,

51
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.740
instead of paying back the hundred year olds,

52
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.180
let's say he just stops paying and then you throw the guy out of the house,

53
00:02:57.181 --> 00:03:00.400
but then you get to sell the house,
the houses there as collateral for the,

54
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.220
for the loan.
Now the loan should have been a hundred.

55
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:05.530
The house should have been worth much more than the hundred.

56
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:08.560
That's why it should have been collateral.
So you should have had,
you know,

57
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:10.570
$120 to the house to sell.

58
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:13.810
So even if the house went down by 33% to 80,

59
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.840
that's still only a $20 loss,

60
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:19.330
or let's say 20 cent loss on the dollar loan.

61
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.460
And that 20 cents comes out of the triple vps.
So you notice how many,

62
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.410
uh,
losses do you have to have?

63
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:30.580
If you're losing 20 cents on a house to have $5 worth of losses,

64
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:33.550
you've got to have 25 or 100 houses go down,

65
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.050
then another 25 of the hundred dollars of the houses have to go down to lose

66
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:42.670
this one.
And then another whole bunch of them,
35 more to go down.

67
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.990
So you've got to have like 85 houses going down before you touch the triple a

68
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:49.960
because the loss is always come from the bottom and work their way up.

69
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.790
So when they need these deals,

70
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.830
they thought it was inconceivable that you'd have 85% of the houses defaulting

71
00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.030
or that you lose so much more than 20% on each house because things like that

72
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:04.660
just hadn't happened before.
And so it seemed like they were incredibly safe.

73
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.980
Okay.
So,
uh,
that was the structure.
And the idea again,

74
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:13.981
was to take risky securities and by securitizing them create a whole bunch of

75
00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:17.830
apparently perfectly safe securities because as we said,

76
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:22.780
the goal of most investors is to invest in something that's completely safe.

77
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:25.690
They don't have to worry about getting more in one state or more in another

78
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:30.550
state.
And this seemed like an ingenious way of turning $1 trillion,

79
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.580
a very risky subprime loans into this is 81% into 800 billion of very safe bonds

80
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.020
and maybe riskier bonds down below that.

81
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.210
So you could never find $1 trillion worth of people willing to lend to subprime

82
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:49.360
borrowers,
but you didn't have to after the securitization,

83
00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:53.380
you only had the f 800 billion of the loans to them were by people who thought

84
00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:54.460
they were perfectly safe.

85
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.970
You only had the guys buying these bonds down here who thought that they are

86
00:04:57.971 --> 00:05:01.150
running a very big risk.
So the whole idea of securitization,

87
00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:05.770
the whole idea of the American financial system was to,

88
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.850
um,
uh,
well,
let's see what the whole idea,

89
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.320
what was to create as many safe loans as possible so you could put it a little

90
00:05:14.321 --> 00:05:18.940
bit more generally.
I should have had this picture before.
You could say,

91
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.770
if
you could say,

92
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.410
if the states of the world,
if,

93
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.980
if you're here today and you might have many of these different states of the

94
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:31.000
world tomorrow,

95
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.380
some people know that they're going to be rich in some states and poor and other

96
00:05:35.381 --> 00:05:39.220
states what they'd like to do is get the same amount in every state.

97
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.730
They can do that by directly buying safe bonds.

98
00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:44.020
That's what everybody's trying to do.

99
00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:46.840
They're trying to hedge themselves to get completely safe bonds.

100
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.640
Most people don't know how to hedge,

101
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.200
so the financial system create safe bonds for them.
Other people,

102
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.180
they do know how to hedge,
but their,

103
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.760
their cash flows are different in the different states because for example,

104
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:00.710
they run a business and if interest rates go up,

105
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:03.500
that might be bad for their business.
If interest rates go down,

106
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:04.680
it might be good for their business.

107
00:06:04.681 --> 00:06:07.190
So they've got different amounts of money in the different states.

108
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.520
And then to create hedging instruments for these people,

109
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.260
you'd like to create securities that pay a lot in states where they want the

110
00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:17.750
money so that way they can by hedging instruments.

111
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.930
So the purpose of the financial system is to create cash flows in states that

112
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.870
people want them.
For the majority of people,

113
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:28.850
that's the same thing in every state.

114
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.050
For other people it's something like the Arrow securities so they can buy money

115
00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:35.540
in the states when they're running short.

116
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.720
And why is this connected to mortgages?

117
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.990
Because how do you know that anyone's going to keep their promise to deliver

118
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:45.170
money in those different states or money in every state?

119
00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:46.940
How do they know they're going to keep?
How do you know they,

120
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.870
you know the people making the promise,
we'll keep their promise,
will you don't.

121
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.650
That's why you need collateral.
And the best collateral in the country is the,

122
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.790
is the houses.

123
00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.320
So the purpose of the financial systems we said all through the course is to

124
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:04.460
create securities that pay off in different states of nature of the tight people

125
00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:07.840
want and that are guaranteed,
you know,

126
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.640
so that people keep their promises guaranteed by collateral.

127
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.870
Houses is the best collateral made it inevitable that the most sophisticated

128
00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:18.470
part of the market was going to turn into the mortgage market.

129
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.550
So at first glance,

130
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:22.880
you would think the most complicated part of the market is the stock market.

131
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.110
But no,

132
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.640
it turns out the collateral is the key because without guaranteeing a promise,

133
00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:32.210
the promise isn't really very good.
And so,
uh,

134
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.740
houses are the best collateral.

135
00:07:33.741 --> 00:07:38.090
So we'll see now that the change in the theory that I want to describe is what

136
00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:41.780
happens when you suppose people might break their promises and you have to take

137
00:07:41.781 --> 00:07:44.980
into account collateral.
All right,
but let's get back to the facts.

138
00:07:44.981 --> 00:07:48.590
So there are $1 trillion of these subprime mortgages around.

139
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.960
So then what happened?
I want to skip through this pretty quickly.
Um,

140
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.041
people you know,

141
00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:58.700
thought that it might be dangerous and they wrote insurance on the sub prime

142
00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:02.240
mortgages.
So uninsurance on a subprime mortgage,

143
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.700
cds credit default swap would say,

144
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.880
if a dollar of the principle of the triple B bond disappears,

145
00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:14.660
and we saw how that could happen.
You take one homeowner who loses 20 cents,

146
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:16.130
I mean,
that will come out of this first.

147
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:20.630
But after all this stuff is wiped out 20 cents of the losses because the

148
00:08:20.631 --> 00:08:22.790
homeowner,
instead of paying his dollar,
you know,

149
00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:24.350
doesn't pay it all the houses sold,

150
00:08:24.351 --> 00:08:28.960
you only get 80 cents back that 20 seconds come outside of the triple B's.

151
00:08:28.961 --> 00:08:33.440
So the insurance would then say that the co,
the the buyer of insurance,

152
00:08:33.441 --> 00:08:35.390
we'd get to collect the 20 cents.

153
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.620
So this seemed like another way for people even in the triple B range to

154
00:08:39.621 --> 00:08:41.270
guarantee their payments.
Well,

155
00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:46.271
it turned out that the triple B that the writers have insurance didn't just

156
00:08:47.481 --> 00:08:50.390
write 20 cents in case it was a 20 cent loss.

157
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:55.040
They might write $10 of insurance on the 10 20 cent loss.

158
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.810
So these,
uh,

159
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.390
credit default swaps or v are getting very close to Errol securities.

160
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:05.660
So the theoretically inclined economists who didn't think very far ahead in the

161
00:09:05.971 --> 00:09:10.620
Clinton administration,
namely Larry Summers and people like that,
Bob Reuben,

162
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.030
they were ecstatic about these credit default swaps because to them it rewind,

163
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:17.880
it reminded them of Errol securities and they thought,
my gosh,

164
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.140
the market is coming close to creating arrows securities and isn't it great that

165
00:09:22.141 --> 00:09:25.500
people will now be able to hedge much better because they've got these arrows

166
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:29.520
securities that they can trade.
Um,
okay,
no problem.

167
00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:31.890
Was that WHO's writing the insurance?

168
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:35.640
The people writing the insurance are big banks and people like Aig.

169
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:40.170
So they're saying if you lose 20 cents,
we'll pay the insurance.

170
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:44.490
Now of course,
that's a promise.
Just like the promise to repay is,

171
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.440
and that should have been collateralized.

172
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:51.710
The trouble is that when Aig as a AAA rated company wrote its promises,

173
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:56.820
many of the people who bought the insurance just figured,
you know,

174
00:09:56.821 --> 00:09:59.070
that's such a great company.
It's obviously going to have,

175
00:09:59.071 --> 00:10:02.160
the money probably isn't going to happen anyway.
Uh,

176
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.380
so I'm not going to worry about the collateral.

177
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.740
And they managed to make all these promises without putting up collateral to

178
00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:10.860
guarantee that they're going to keep their promises.
This,

179
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.270
this a mistake that people make.
Well,
it's probably not going to happen anyway,

180
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.080
that we were going to even collect the insurance.

181
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.090
You shouldn't have bought the insurance if you didn't think you were going to

182
00:10:18.091 --> 00:10:20.850
collect it.
So obviously,
even though it's a low probability event,

183
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.930
you have to think what will happen when it comes time to collect the insurance.

184
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.270
Are they going to have the money?
Now,

185
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:32.420
many banks in Europe bought these things and they're accused of having realized

186
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.980
that they wouldn't be paid off.

187
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:39.180
They only bought it so they can convince their regulators that they actually had

188
00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:43.620
a very sound bank and therefore didn't have to,
you know,
set aside capital.

189
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.890
And,
uh,
they knew very well that they probably wouldn't be paid off.

190
00:10:46.891 --> 00:10:50.130
They just didn't think that it mattered because things wouldn't go that bad.

191
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:53.700
So in any case,
we've got the circle back.

192
00:10:53.701 --> 00:10:57.000
We've got these subprime mortgages where you've written a bunch of apparently

193
00:10:57.001 --> 00:10:59.760
safe bonds,
a lot of people,
but not many.
You know,

194
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.160
20% holding dangerous bonds,

195
00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:05.400
realizing that they're dangerous and you've got a bunch of insurance written on

196
00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:07.590
the dangerous bonds,
but of a bit much bigger,

197
00:11:07.591 --> 00:11:11.190
five times as big as the amount of a dangerous bonds.

198
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.810
So all these things,
you know,
are,
if,
if something goes wrong with that pool,

199
00:11:15.811 --> 00:11:19.410
these ones are going to lose and then the writers of insurance are also going to

200
00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:24.240
lose a huge amount of money.
Okay.
So what happened?

201
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:29.460
Well,
on top of that,
you know,
there was a CDO market,
um,

202
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:34.500
where you took the triple bead pieces and broke those up like you did before

203
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:38.040
into,
uh,
into bonds,
more triple A's and so on.

204
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:43.080
So if something happened to this original pool and the,
you know,

205
00:11:43.081 --> 00:11:46.800
a lot of people home started defaulting,
that would wipe out all the triple B's,

206
00:11:46.801 --> 00:11:51.270
forcing all these people to pay insurance.
And on top of that,
the CDO market,

207
00:11:51.271 --> 00:11:55.720
which is just the same thing done again,
but using the triple B's is collateral.

208
00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:00.280
All these things would get wiped out and including the triple A's here.
Okay.

209
00:12:00.281 --> 00:12:01.300
And then that wasn't enough.

210
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:06.301
Wall Street then wrote Cdo squareds on the trip will an a pieces of the CDOS.

211
00:12:06.611 --> 00:12:09.660
All right,
so we talked all about this last time.
So now I want to get into what,

212
00:12:09.661 --> 00:12:12.880
uh,
happened.
Any questions?
Yes.

213
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:17.370
<v 1>Is there any way</v>

214
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.560
the normal two plays a thrive from like for example or are they,

215
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:32.480
<v 0>no,
a buyer knows very well whereas AAA is coming from a buyer has access to all.</v>

216
00:12:32.481 --> 00:12:33.311
So if you were a buyer,

217
00:12:33.311 --> 00:12:37.760
so why the hedge fund I work with Ellington was a big buyer of these kinds of

218
00:12:37.761 --> 00:12:41.960
things and also you'll see what the,
our strategy was,

219
00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.550
but we knew very well that,
uh,
so we,
we didn't,
okay.

220
00:12:46.551 --> 00:12:51.110
So what's,
go back to this,
we are big buyer of a,
of things here.

221
00:12:51.111 --> 00:12:53.060
Like these triple B's.
We bought a lot of,

222
00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.620
so we could get for every single home in this pool.
We knew the history,

223
00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:01.430
we know the loan to value the income of the,
of the borrower,

224
00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.350
what zip code the borrower lives in.

225
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.740
We know a tremendous amount of information about each one of these individual

226
00:13:06.741 --> 00:13:10.220
houses,
how they've paid before,
what kind of credit rating they have,

227
00:13:10.221 --> 00:13:12.680
all that information we have.
And so we,
you know,

228
00:13:12.681 --> 00:13:16.370
build a model of how reliable we think these borrowers are and what they're

229
00:13:16.371 --> 00:13:20.040
gonna do.
And so on the basis that information,
we can predict whether we,

230
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.630
what we think the value of the triple B is going to be and whether it makes

231
00:13:23.631 --> 00:13:27.710
sense to buy insurance on it or not.
So what was our strategy by the way,

232
00:13:27.711 --> 00:13:32.570
in our hedge fund,
our strategy was take a pool where we think that the,

233
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.830
the pool is really a good pool by the riskiest piece,
which is down here.

234
00:13:36.831 --> 00:13:41.330
The residual that I described last time for which there's no insurance.
Okay?

235
00:13:41.331 --> 00:13:45.740
Now it may be that the whole world goes to hell and we lose money on our

236
00:13:45.741 --> 00:13:48.890
residual.
But so how do we hedge that?

237
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.540
What we do is then we take what we think is a bad pool of loans.
You know,

238
00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:57.320
where the there from a county that we think people aren't as reliable say.

239
00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.160
And we bought,
we don't buy the residual.
In fact,
we do the opposite.

240
00:14:01.161 --> 00:14:05.240
We buy the insurance on the triple B.
There is no insurance and the residual.

241
00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.420
So for the bad pool,
we've bought the insurance for the good pool.

242
00:14:08.421 --> 00:14:11.600
We've bought the residual.
And so if we're right,
we're going to,

243
00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.570
the residual is going to pay a lot of money because these people aren't going to

244
00:14:14.571 --> 00:14:15.320
default.

245
00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.290
And if the bad pools as bad as we think they're going to default and we're going

246
00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:20.870
to collect the insurance so we're going to win on both.

247
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:26.000
And if the whole market collapses,
well our residual will go to zero.

248
00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.900
But so will the triple B and the bad pool and we'll collect insurance and so

249
00:14:29.901 --> 00:14:32.570
we'll be protected.
So that was our strategy.
So yes,

250
00:14:32.571 --> 00:14:35.600
the answer is you have a lot of information about what you're buying

251
00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:39.283
<v 1>AAA.</v>

252
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:42.230
<v 0>Yeah,
this appears the AAA of a bad pool,</v>

253
00:14:42.231 --> 00:14:46.700
but the people buying the AAA know exactly what's in the pool.
Okay.
Now they may,

254
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:51.730
they may be dumb and not bother to think about it and just trust the AAA without

255
00:14:51.831 --> 00:14:55.490
thinking about it.
But probably a lot of them did think about it.
Okay.

256
00:14:55.491 --> 00:14:58.280
And if we take this pool,
the CDO,

257
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.760
these triple A's were held mostly by big banks and you would have thought they

258
00:15:02.761 --> 00:15:06.260
are the most sophisticated of all the buyers because they're the ones creating

259
00:15:06.261 --> 00:15:09.590
the pools.
So they certainly know what's in the pools.

260
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.310
They're are the ones who created this original pool here.

261
00:15:13.311 --> 00:15:16.310
They're the ones who underwrote those loans and you know,

262
00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:19.670
and so they're the ones,
you know,
they know everything about it.

263
00:15:19.671 --> 00:15:22.040
And they are the ones who are holding all these triple A's.

264
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.740
So we're not talking about people have no idea what they're doing.

265
00:15:24.741 --> 00:15:28.100
We're talking about people who supposedly do not what they're doing.
All right?

266
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.940
So that was the,
that was the basis of the market.
Now what happened,

267
00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:37.140
okay,
so I can describe our hedging strategy in our models,

268
00:15:37.141 --> 00:15:40.080
but I'm not going to do that.
Okay.
So this was our strategy.

269
00:15:40.081 --> 00:15:45.030
You go along the residual short,
the bad pool.
Okay.
Now what happened?

270
00:15:45.031 --> 00:15:46.780
I'll just,
here's what happened.

271
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:51.000
So there was an index that was created in the beginning of 2006.

272
00:15:51.001 --> 00:15:55.620
You just put together a huge number of triple B bonds and triple a bonds of

273
00:15:55.621 --> 00:16:00.540
different pools and average their prices.
That's the index.
And so it's,

274
00:16:00.541 --> 00:16:02.700
uh,
they're all a hundred,
you see,

275
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.730
and then in January of 2007,

276
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.230
all of a sudden the market starts to go crazy.
And by March and April,

277
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.050
it's collapsed.
These bonds,
a lot of them,

278
00:16:13.051 --> 00:16:17.280
the triple B's have collapsed from a hundred where everything was all the way

279
00:16:17.281 --> 00:16:20.200
down to s to 60,
just like that.

280
00:16:20.201 --> 00:16:24.120
And a few months at one from a hundred to 60 a hundred here,

281
00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:26.130
three or four months later,
it's 60.

282
00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:30.210
This is march of 2007.
Okay.

283
00:16:30.211 --> 00:16:34.710
Now what was the stock market doing then?
You might remember the stock market.

284
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:35.643
Um,

285
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:38.000
<v 2>p.</v>

286
00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:43.240
<v 0>So here's the stock market,
uh,
too,
too far in historical time.</v>

287
00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:47.230
But anyway,
here's the stock market.
You know,
I had this Nasdaq collapsed,

288
00:16:47.231 --> 00:16:49.030
but this point right here

289
00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:54.050
is October 31st,
2007,

290
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.710
so 10 months or nine months later,
the stock market,

291
00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:01.490
it's reaches its peak.
So all this time from here up,

292
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.710
the stock market is climbing and climbing and climbing.

293
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.260
So the sub prime mortgage market has collapsed,

294
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.070
but clearly the rest of the population doesn't think the things are that bad.

295
00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.990
Okay,
so don't,
just to,
to put everything in perspective.
What else?

296
00:17:14.991 --> 00:17:19.020
Uh,
what,
where else are we,
what other big um,

297
00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.510
housing,
let's look at housing prices here.

298
00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:27.890
We're going to come back to this graph if you can see it.
So this is 2000 here.

299
00:17:27.891 --> 00:17:32.600
This is 2009 here.
Green is the housing.
This is Schiller's housing index.

300
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:37.840
So if you set it at a hundred in 2000 up here at the very top,

301
00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:42.410
that's the middle of 2006.
Okay.

302
00:17:42.411 --> 00:17:44.870
It hit its peak and then started to come.

303
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:48.320
So how's he hit its peak in the middle of 2006,
you know,

304
00:17:48.321 --> 00:17:52.140
third quarter of 2006 sub prime mortgages.

305
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.830
And then sort of didn't come down very fast,
but started to come down.

306
00:17:56.250 --> 00:18:01.250
Subprime mortgages collapsed in January of 2007 and the stock market started as

307
00:18:02.131 --> 00:18:06.960
very quick collapse in,
you know,
October,
November,
2007.

308
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:11.070
So it was first housing prices turn,
then subprime mortgages collapsed,

309
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.360
then the stock market 10 months later collapsed.
Okay.

310
00:18:15.361 --> 00:18:20.200
So we have to explain all these things and what was going on.
So in the,

311
00:18:20.201 --> 00:18:20.590
uh,

312
00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:25.430
<v 3>I'm
sorry,
where was I?</v>

313
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.720
<v 0>Okay,
so this is the subprime market collapse.
Why did this market collapse?</v>

314
00:18:30.721 --> 00:18:32.370
What happened to make them collapse?

315
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:36.500
This is actually an example of the wonders,
the,
the,

316
00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:40.230
the wonderful nature of the American financial system.

317
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:45.030
The fact that market collapsed is a great thing because why did it collapse?

318
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:45.631
Okay.

319
00:18:45.631 --> 00:18:48.540
What was the information that made people think that things were going to go

320
00:18:48.541 --> 00:18:50.140
down?
Well,
it was this,

321
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.220
<v 3>uh,
uh,</v>

322
00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.210
<v 0>this information,
human of loss by reporting month.</v>

323
00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:04.450
Okay,
let's,
um,
let's look at some,

324
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.200
these are countrywide,
there.
One of the bad guys,
this is country that is there.

325
00:19:08.201 --> 00:19:11.800
One of the ones whose loans went bad and the company went out of business

326
00:19:11.801 --> 00:19:14.290
basically and got bought by Bank of America.

327
00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:18.580
So look at delinquencies historically.
So for 2003,

328
00:19:18.581 --> 00:19:22.450
these are countrywide loans given in 2003.
Okay.

329
00:19:22.451 --> 00:19:25.630
It's the brown thing.
So here are their delinquencies,
right?

330
00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.400
They started zero naturally,

331
00:19:27.401 --> 00:19:31.450
and then they go up to 2% and they stay there as a function of the pool.

332
00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:33.260
Now some people are,
you know,

333
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.770
some of those guys are defaulting and being thrown out of the pool.

334
00:19:35.771 --> 00:19:37.480
That's how delinquencies can go down.
Also,

335
00:19:37.481 --> 00:19:39.520
people can start paying after being delinquent.

336
00:19:39.521 --> 00:19:44.230
Delinquent just means you're missing some payments.
Okay?
Look at it.
2004.
Okay,

337
00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.760
there's still hardly doing anything.
And then look at the 2005.

338
00:19:48.761 --> 00:19:53.650
While all of a sudden delinquency start going up in 2005 there,
5% by,
by,

339
00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:56.230
uh,
the end of 2007.
But delinquencies,

340
00:19:56.231 --> 00:20:00.370
5% delinquencies were just talking about people who mix,
missed a few payments,

341
00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:04.060
5% delinquencies.
They haven't actually been thrown out of their house.

342
00:20:04.061 --> 00:20:06.520
It takes 18 months.
Nobody's lost anything.

343
00:20:06.521 --> 00:20:09.160
They've just been delinquent for a little while.
Okay.

344
00:20:09.161 --> 00:20:13.610
So what was the catastrophe that made the market collapse?
Um,

345
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:14.880
<v 3>okay,</v>

346
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.990
<v 0>well this is it.</v>

347
00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:21.090
So while it means weighted average age,
okay,

348
00:20:21.091 --> 00:20:25.710
so look at the months.
So you take things that were issued in,
uh,

349
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.990
you know,
uh,
this is the securitization there.

350
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:32.640
They're bundled together in the beginning of 2006.

351
00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:37.560
This is the second half of 2006 but the loan's actually started in 2005.

352
00:20:37.561 --> 00:20:40.830
They just didn't get bumped to the homeowners got their mortgages in 2005.

353
00:20:40.831 --> 00:20:44.810
They got securitized in 2006.
So you look at the,
uh,

354
00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:49.360
delinquencies and you see that,
you know,
nothing happens the first 12 months,

355
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.810
these are losses.
And then eventually it goes to 1%.

356
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:57.700
The losses go to 1%.
We're not talking about giant numbers.
Well,

357
00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:02.730
everybody saw that then they looked at the losses for things issued in 2002nd

358
00:21:02.771 --> 00:21:07.480
half of 2006.
Okay.
And the losses,
that's this blue line.

359
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:12.730
They,
uh,
you know,
are going to,
we're talking about,
you know,

360
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:17.350
20 months later they're going to 1% or 1.2%.

361
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.410
You look at the things begin issued in 2007,

362
00:21:20.411 --> 00:21:23.290
which means that the loans you're really measuring from somewhere in the middle

363
00:21:23.291 --> 00:21:26.830
of 2006.
Okay.
At at,
uh,
you know,

364
00:21:26.831 --> 00:21:31.570
a year you're at half a percent and in the second half of 2007 year,
you know,

365
00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:35.800
your 0.2% losses.
So no losses at all.

366
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:40.450
So nothing horrible has happened except for the fact there's an obvious pattern

367
00:21:40.451 --> 00:21:41.380
here.
You know,

368
00:21:41.381 --> 00:21:45.790
it seems like every new or vintage it's getting worse and worse and worse and

369
00:21:45.791 --> 00:21:46.570
worse.

370
00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:50.650
And so it was on that basis just seeing things getting worse before there are

371
00:21:50.651 --> 00:21:52.150
any losses.
Remember,

372
00:21:52.151 --> 00:21:55.510
these are very sophisticated people betting hundreds of millions of dollars.

373
00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:59.230
They're thinking hard about this even though nothing had happened yet.

374
00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.210
The market collapsed.
Okay?

375
00:22:01.211 --> 00:22:05.770
So this collapse that happens here is before anybody's lost any money,

376
00:22:05.771 --> 00:22:07.540
hardly anyone has been thrown out of their house.

377
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.250
Nothing's happened in the economy,

378
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.300
but the traders have already figured out things are in a bad course,

379
00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.810
things are going to look really bad and the market collapsed.
Okay?

380
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.370
So we had warning,
this is the beginning of 2007.
We're almost at the end of 2000.

381
00:22:21.371 --> 00:22:24.580
So it was almost three years ago,
nearly three years ago.

382
00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:28.630
Everybody should have known that the market had figured out that there was going

383
00:22:28.631 --> 00:22:30.940
to be a catastrophe in the sub prime world,

384
00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:35.650
a real catastrophe because the losses were going to be 40% that's what they are

385
00:22:35.651 --> 00:22:40.300
expecting.
You can't have losses like that unless you throw out,
you know,

386
00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:41.710
you can't,
you know,

387
00:22:41.711 --> 00:22:44.650
it's a huge number of people who have to get thrown out of their houses and you

388
00:22:44.651 --> 00:22:49.030
have to lose a huge amount of money on each house in order to get losses of 40%

389
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.640
like I said,
if you lose 50% on every loan,

390
00:22:51.641 --> 00:22:56.260
you have to throw 80% of the people out of their houses to get 40% losses.

391
00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.780
So this meant that people were expecting gigantic catastrophe.
By the way,
this,

392
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.100
that was an exaggeration because this is the triple BP.

393
00:23:03.101 --> 00:23:06.610
So I meant the triple B piece was going to lose 40% so you know,

394
00:23:06.611 --> 00:23:10.750
the triple bead pieces only protected by six or 8% so it means the total losses

395
00:23:10.751 --> 00:23:15.751
would be 10% which means that a 10 or 15% which means if you're losing 50% on a

396
00:23:16.961 --> 00:23:20.050
house,
30% of the people are going to be thrown out of their houses.
Okay.

397
00:23:20.051 --> 00:23:24.100
So it's like 30% losses in 30% of the people thrown out of their houses.

398
00:23:24.101 --> 00:23:26.980
That was the expectation then.
But that's still terrible.

399
00:23:26.981 --> 00:23:29.320
There were 5 million subprime people.

400
00:23:29.321 --> 00:23:33.100
So the market at this point is expecting 30% of them to be thrown out of their

401
00:23:33.101 --> 00:23:37.060
houses with 30% losses even though the losses says or 1% or less.

402
00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.990
So you can see how far sighted the uh,
the market is.

403
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.460
So our government,

404
00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:45.380
everybody should have been warned right at this point that something was going

405
00:23:45.381 --> 00:23:49.550
to happen.
Now,
did the stock market realized this was such a catastrophe?

406
00:23:49.551 --> 00:23:53.050
Absolutely not because the stock market waited till,
you know,

407
00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:57.380
the end of 2007 which we're talking about here before you know,

408
00:23:57.381 --> 00:24:01.370
and now look at where the losses are and subprime bonds here or the stock market

409
00:24:01.371 --> 00:24:02.420
started to go down.

410
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:05.900
So it had all this warning that something horrible was happening in the mortgage

411
00:24:05.901 --> 00:24:10.070
market,
but the stock market owners thought nothing of it.
They thought,
well,

412
00:24:10.071 --> 00:24:14.390
how could this possibly affect us and only here do they start to catch on?

413
00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.580
Okay.
So,

414
00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:17.690
<v 3>okay,</v>

415
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.910
<v 0>to give you an example of the losses,</v>

416
00:24:19.911 --> 00:24:24.860
this is only up to the December,
2007 people kept announcing losses.
You know,

417
00:24:24.861 --> 00:24:27.830
Marilyn announced 9 billion city corporate amounts,
10 billion.

418
00:24:27.831 --> 00:24:31.090
Then the next week,
another 10 million UBS announced 3.7 billion.

419
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.760
Then another 10 billion,
Goldman announced five go get Morgan Stanley 4 billion.

420
00:24:34.761 --> 00:24:38.480
Every other day someone was coming up saying that they lost all these billions.

421
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.790
Okay?
And that was only in December,

422
00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:45.710
2007 the loss is accelerated like crazy through the 2008 so there were hundreds

423
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:48.770
of billions of dollars lost.
Now the whole sub prime market is only a trillion.

424
00:24:48.771 --> 00:24:52.820
But remember there was all that insurance written on it and who is writing the

425
00:24:52.821 --> 00:24:56.570
insurance?
These very same people.
We're the ones writing the insurance.

426
00:24:56.571 --> 00:25:00.080
You're not only lost the hundreds of billions in the subprime market,

427
00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:03.890
but also the multiply that by five,
the hundreds of billions.

428
00:25:03.891 --> 00:25:08.240
All these guys wrote in insurance and NCDs triple A's that they held.

429
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:12.200
Okay.
So,
um,
all right.
Now let's see,

430
00:25:12.201 --> 00:25:15.800
one other fact that's quite interesting.

431
00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:17.043
<v 3>MMM,</v>

432
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.320
<v 0>okay.
These are prepayments.
Okay.</v>

433
00:25:24.321 --> 00:25:29.321
So I told you that in subprime loans for the first two years,

434
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:34.280
the subprime loan,
you'd be locked into the loan,
a huge penalty if you prepaid.

435
00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:38.600
But between year two and year three,
you could prepay,
you know,
get a new loan.

436
00:25:38.601 --> 00:25:42.020
We finance it.
And then in year three the interest rate would jump.

437
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:43.920
So what would people do?
Well,

438
00:25:43.921 --> 00:25:47.000
people who've made all their payments the first two years will be regarded as

439
00:25:47.001 --> 00:25:50.740
reliable payers.
And so of course they would,
they would refinance.

440
00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.070
They no longer be such subprime people.
They'd refinance into,
into,

441
00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.870
um,
you know,

442
00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:00.680
loans with lower interest because they regarded as better credit risks.

443
00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:05.390
If you go back to 2003,
you see that after the second year,

444
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.520
prepayments go up to 70%.

445
00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:12.650
So 70% of the people would refinance their loan between year two and three in

446
00:26:12.651 --> 00:26:16.010
2004 that's the pink one.
The same thing happened.

447
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:19.030
60 or 70% of all those people,
you know,

448
00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:22.220
over the course of a year refinance their loans.

449
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.880
So that means that the original lenders get 70% of the money back.

450
00:26:25.881 --> 00:26:28.550
It's like a prepayment,
like we have in mortgages,
one sub prime.

451
00:26:28.551 --> 00:26:31.790
These guys had a huge incentive to do it once they prove that they're good

452
00:26:31.791 --> 00:26:34.910
people.
And as I told you,
most of the subprime borrowers are,
you know,

453
00:26:34.911 --> 00:26:38.300
young people I'd screwed up with their credit cards and things like that.

454
00:26:38.301 --> 00:26:40.910
And after they paid for a while,
people would realize that,
you know,

455
00:26:40.911 --> 00:26:43.040
they'd settled down and give them a new loan.

456
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:47.250
But look what's happened to these numbers.
So if you jump to 2007,

457
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:52.920
all these things just collapsed,
no more prepayments.

458
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.110
And once they're no more prepayments,

459
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.620
that means the lenders don't get their 70% backs.

460
00:26:58.621 --> 00:27:00.120
If you're a hedge fund figuring,
you know,

461
00:27:00.121 --> 00:27:03.210
how much can I lose if I buy one of these sub prying things,

462
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.160
you know that between year two and year three,

463
00:27:05.161 --> 00:27:09.870
you're going to get 70% of your money back.
Um,
so you can't lose more than 30%.

464
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:13.290
All of a sudden you're getting 10% of your money back,

465
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:18.000
which means you could lose 90%.
Okay.
So why would that have happened?
Um,

466
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:22.380
well,
we're going to come to that.
Okay.
So that's,
uh,

467
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:26.450
those are the basic facts.
Okay.
I'm not going to,
I don't have time to,

468
00:27:26.451 --> 00:27:29.880
to say more of that.
Okay.
So any questions about those basic facts?

469
00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.820
Now we need something to explain how they happen.
Yes.

470
00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:39.890
<v 2>Right,</v>

471
00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:43.010
<v 0>exactly.
So people were realizing,
yeah,</v>

472
00:27:43.011 --> 00:27:46.770
that was all that it was people just said to themselves every,
um,

473
00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:51.950
it's exactly what I'm saying that people said,
look,
you know,

474
00:27:51.951 --> 00:27:54.980
we know that that losses are going to increase,
but you know,

475
00:27:54.981 --> 00:27:56.840
they're probably not going to get very far.
You know,

476
00:27:56.841 --> 00:28:00.530
historically they get to 3% or 4% or something like that.
That's it.

477
00:28:00.531 --> 00:28:03.770
That's all we have to worry about.
And it's early on.

478
00:28:03.771 --> 00:28:05.480
So it's not like we've seen any losses,

479
00:28:05.481 --> 00:28:09.050
but they just seem to be happening so much faster than they did before.

480
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:12.680
Let's extrapolate that curve now.
How do you extrapolate a curve like that?

481
00:28:12.681 --> 00:28:15.620
You know,
there's so many ways you could extrapolate it.
So they,

482
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:19.100
the market extrapolated and thought,
gosh,
things are getting just much worse.

483
00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:23.090
And the market started to collapse.
You see,
in real trading markets,

484
00:28:23.091 --> 00:28:26.660
people respond very quickly to very little information.
I mean,
there are law,

485
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:29.810
you know,
their whole livelihood depends on,
it's all they're thinking about.

486
00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:34.370
And so they're coming up with quick conclusions,
which,
you know,
in this case,

487
00:28:34.371 --> 00:28:36.170
like in many others,
they're not so crazy.

488
00:28:36.171 --> 00:28:40.070
They're realizing something bad is happening and they're acting very quickly.

489
00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:41.510
Okay.
And so huge,

490
00:28:41.511 --> 00:28:45.650
billions of dollars are being lost just on the basis of this amount of evidence.

491
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:47.510
It's real.
You know,

492
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:52.600
I think this brings home how fast the market acts and how expectations about the

493
00:28:53.181 --> 00:28:55.730
future of driving prices.
And therefore,

494
00:28:55.731 --> 00:28:59.000
how much information you remember we said that if you just pay attention to the

495
00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:02.180
market,
you can learn a lot.
Well,
we didn't learn that much.

496
00:29:02.181 --> 00:29:03.110
The whole stock market,

497
00:29:03.111 --> 00:29:05.070
they weren't paying attention to what was happening though.

498
00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:08.450
The mortgage market was collapsing.
That should have meant something,

499
00:29:08.451 --> 00:29:10.430
but they weren't paying attention to it.
You know,

500
00:29:10.431 --> 00:29:13.250
nothing in the world seemed to change because there were no people on the

501
00:29:13.251 --> 00:29:17.090
streets yet.
Okay.
Now there are people employed,
there are people on the streets.

502
00:29:17.091 --> 00:29:20.930
They're going to be millions of,
uh,
of,
uh,
guys on the streets,
pretty soon,

503
00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:23.840
homeowners on the streets.
Um,
and of course,

504
00:29:23.841 --> 00:29:27.140
so now the stock markets caught on and things are really bad.
All right,

505
00:29:27.141 --> 00:29:29.810
so let me,
so any more questions about this?

506
00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:31.683
<v 2>Okay.</v>

507
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:36.770
<v 0>So now I want to talk about a way of understanding what happened and then I'm</v>

508
00:29:36.841 --> 00:29:40.230
going to end.
So I'm going to go from more general to more specifics.

509
00:29:40.231 --> 00:29:44.620
I'm going talking about a way of what happened and then we're going to talk

510
00:29:44.621 --> 00:29:46.390
concretely about,
uh,

511
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.650
how you would change the mathematics we've been doing all semester.

512
00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:55.540
So my view of all this is that it's the leverage cycle.

513
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.870
Okay.
Which is the leverage cycle as I'll define it in a second,

514
00:29:58.871 --> 00:30:02.050
has to do with putting up collateral to make sure that you're going to pay.

515
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:04.840
And so far in the course,
we've paid no attention to that.

516
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:09.790
And in all of economic theory,
they never paid attention to that.

517
00:30:09.791 --> 00:30:13.120
You can read any one of those textbooks that we,
uh,

518
00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:14.770
that you were on the reading list,
you know,

519
00:30:14.771 --> 00:30:18.550
by all the Great Nobel Prize winners and all the great financial economists.

520
00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:24.060
And you'll never see the word hardly ever see the word collateral and what the

521
00:30:24.491 --> 00:30:29.170
EC,
you'll never see what's the equilibrium amount of collateral.
Okay.
And so,

522
00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:33.400
um,
that's been entirely missing.
So in fact,

523
00:30:33.401 --> 00:30:35.800
if you think about macroeconomics and the Fed,

524
00:30:35.801 --> 00:30:38.530
they always tell you that if you know,
things go bad in the economy,

525
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.130
reduce the interest rate.
That's the way we can stimulate investment.

526
00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.340
We can raise the price of assets by lowering the interest rate.

527
00:30:45.341 --> 00:30:48.250
If we raised the interest rate will lower the price of a assets.

528
00:30:48.251 --> 00:30:52.510
We can always get the economy to boom or slowed down by adjusting the interest

529
00:30:52.511 --> 00:30:54.730
rate.
And our great,
uh,
you know,

530
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.620
the most important thing ever done in macro economics is to establish,
you know,

531
00:30:59.621 --> 00:31:02.560
in theory and practice is to establish the Federal Reserve and give it the

532
00:31:02.561 --> 00:31:05.410
responsibility of managing interest rates.
Now,
in my view,

533
00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:08.980
it should be managing collateral rates and not interest rates.
And in fact,

534
00:31:08.981 --> 00:31:10.120
it has the power to man.

535
00:31:10.121 --> 00:31:13.660
It's been given the authority to manage collateral rates when it was created,

536
00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:17.590
but it just never exercised that authority.
Now,
as I said it in class,
you know,

537
00:31:17.591 --> 00:31:21.460
Shakespeare already had this idea,
um,
you know,
in the merchant of Venice,

538
00:31:21.461 --> 00:31:22.031
as we said,

539
00:31:22.031 --> 00:31:24.760
they were haggling over the interest rate and not just over collateral.

540
00:31:24.761 --> 00:31:29.761
And Shakespeare anticipated the impatience theory of interest in Shylock who,

541
00:31:30.311 --> 00:31:30.671
you know,

542
00:31:30.671 --> 00:31:34.630
if the modern reading of the merchant of Venice is that it's about antisemitism

543
00:31:34.631 --> 00:31:36.340
and shy,
like supposed to be a bad guy.

544
00:31:36.341 --> 00:31:39.670
I don't think Shai Shakespeare intended that at all.
In fact,

545
00:31:39.671 --> 00:31:42.340
Shylock is much more sophisticated by far,

546
00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:45.770
much better understanding of what's going on in the world than either Antonia or

547
00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.090
we'll certainly then Antonio who is the merchant of Venice and,

548
00:31:49.091 --> 00:31:52.030
and Bassania was actually,
I think quite clever,

549
00:31:52.031 --> 00:31:56.860
although Harold bloom makes Bizani all out to be an idiot and an a dupe and

550
00:31:56.861 --> 00:32:00.700
can't imagine how Portia could possibly marry such a guy.
But anyway,

551
00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:04.120
I think that besides,
it was a very attractive guy and I,

552
00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:09.460
and I think that,
uh,
um,
Shylock is,

553
00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:11.650
he's the only one who really understands what's going on.

554
00:32:11.651 --> 00:32:16.270
So he explains the entire modern theory of impatience to,
uh,

555
00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.710
to,
to,
uh,
Bussani on Antonio and says that's why the interest rates should be,

556
00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:25.120
you know,
high.
And then they haggle over the collateral.
And of course,

557
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.770
Shakespeare in my view,

558
00:32:26.771 --> 00:32:29.800
thought the collateral was much more important than the interest because nobody

559
00:32:29.801 --> 00:32:31.600
can remember the rate of interest they agreed on,

560
00:32:31.601 --> 00:32:34.750
but everybody remembers the pound of flesh collateral.
Okay.

561
00:32:34.751 --> 00:32:38.290
And remember that the play ends with,
uh,
you know,

562
00:32:38.291 --> 00:32:41.960
the ships all sinking apparently.
And so whether,
you know,
it should shy,

563
00:32:41.961 --> 00:32:46.880
like B take as collateral or not.
And uh,
the court rules,

564
00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:50.150
not that you should reduce the collateral,
they shouldn't take the collateral,

565
00:32:50.151 --> 00:32:51.770
but you should have a different collateral,

566
00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:54.470
should have been a pound of flesh but not a drop of blood.

567
00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:58.700
So it's the responsibility of the judicial system and the regulatory body to

568
00:32:58.701 --> 00:33:01.880
monitor,
not the interest rate,
not the amount of the borrowing,

569
00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.010
but the collateral that's put up for it.

570
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.470
And that's exactly what my message is going to be.

571
00:33:06.471 --> 00:33:08.840
We have to manage the collateral.
Okay.

572
00:33:08.841 --> 00:33:13.841
And so I wrote about this starting in 1997 and a 2003 and then again in 2008 and

573
00:33:15.921 --> 00:33:19.550
a,
I've written with a bunch of people and I have students who wrote on it and

574
00:33:19.551 --> 00:33:23.210
they're a ratio and pesto or two Brazilians who wrote about it.

575
00:33:23.211 --> 00:33:27.900
I gave a talk there in 1997.
I got them going on it.
And then,
uh,

576
00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:32.420
Bernanki himself wrote about collateral,
uh,
in the 90 same time,

577
00:33:32.421 --> 00:33:36.920
even earlier than I was,
but he didn't have the idea of leverage.
Okay.

578
00:33:36.921 --> 00:33:40.820
And by and collateral.
So what do I and collateral rate he had?

579
00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:43.640
He knew that you needed collateral.
Talked about collateral.

580
00:33:43.641 --> 00:33:47.540
We didn't talk about the ratio in the rate.
So what do I mean by that?

581
00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:52.160
If you have a house that's worth $100 say it's collateral for a loan.

582
00:33:52.161 --> 00:33:55.300
Because if you don't pay the loan,
they can take your house.
Okay,
is,

583
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:58.310
that's called no recourse collateral if they take your house,

584
00:33:58.311 --> 00:34:00.320
but they can't go after you for anything more.

585
00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:04.340
Now that in fact is not in by law what happens.
But in practice,

586
00:34:04.341 --> 00:34:06.890
what happens if you default on your mortgage,

587
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:10.280
they'll take your house but they aren't going to come after you to try and get

588
00:34:10.281 --> 00:34:12.290
your,
you know,
income or something like that.

589
00:34:12.291 --> 00:34:16.370
So it's as if all they can do is take your house in some states explicitly by

590
00:34:16.371 --> 00:34:20.510
law,
they can only take your house and other states,
you still owe the money.

591
00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:23.990
But they always just say,
forget about it.
We're just taking your house.

592
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:27.170
So I'm going to assume that you just,
they take your house and no more.

593
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:32.830
Now if the house is worth $100 and you borrow 80,
then the,

594
00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:37.870
the collateral rate is 125% because $100 house is protecting,

595
00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.830
uh,
an $80 loans.

596
00:34:41.831 --> 00:34:44.890
So it's 125% the loan devalue,

597
00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.210
it's an $80 loan on $100 houses,

598
00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:51.500
80% the margin is the margin of safety.

599
00:34:51.501 --> 00:34:55.250
It's $100 house.
So the lender thinks that he's protected because he's got,

600
00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:59.720
he's holding $100 house and they only gave you $20.
Okay?

601
00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:04.840
So it's 20% and the leverage is five because with $20 of cash,

602
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:09.290
you've managed to buy a house worth five times as much a hundred.

603
00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.210
So these numbers are all the same thing.
You know,

604
00:35:11.211 --> 00:35:14.990
it's just different ways of saying the same thing.
So I prefer leverage,

605
00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:18.200
but a collateral,
right?
They're all the same thing.

606
00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:25.910
Five is a hundred dollar house and you only pay $20,
you borrow the other 80.

607
00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.960
So with $20 of cash,
you can manage to own $100 asset.

608
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:32.450
So the leverage is five.
Okay?

609
00:35:32.451 --> 00:35:35.780
So people who borrow lot can own huge quantities of things,

610
00:35:35.781 --> 00:35:40.530
even though they had hardly any.
So as I say,
when you're negotiating the loan,

611
00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.390
you have to negotiate the interest rate,

612
00:35:42.391 --> 00:35:44.910
but you also have to negotiate the leverage.
You know,

613
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:48.600
how much cash do you have to put down in order to get the house?

614
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.060
How much can you borrow using the house as collateral?

615
00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:55.560
Now on the standard theory that Fisher taught that we've described in this
class,

616
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.290
you've got supply and demand determining the interest rate.

617
00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:00.240
Leverage never appeared.
You know,

618
00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:04.860
we just always assumed everyone was going to repay their loan.
So in my theory,

619
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:09.450
supply and demand are going to determine both the interest rate and the

620
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:10.343
leverage.

621
00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:14.640
Now that seems a little shocking because how can one equation determined two

622
00:36:14.641 --> 00:36:15.450
variables?

623
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:18.810
So I think it's for this reason that economists basically all these years

624
00:36:18.811 --> 00:36:23.430
ignored leverage because they just didn't see any way to fit two variables with

625
00:36:23.431 --> 00:36:26.520
one equation and solve for two variables.
So they just said,
well,

626
00:36:26.521 --> 00:36:30.510
for simplicity we'll assume everyone always repays.
Okay,

627
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:34.200
now what is it that's going to determine leverage?
Well,

628
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:35.970
this is common sense.
You know,

629
00:36:35.971 --> 00:36:40.080
as Fisher and Shakespeare before him said that interest rates are determined by

630
00:36:40.081 --> 00:36:43.650
impatiens.
In my view,
leverage.

631
00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:46.440
There are many determinants of,
but the most important determinant,

632
00:36:46.441 --> 00:36:50.430
it's volatility,
the volatility,
the asset price.
Why is that?

633
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:54.960
Because you've got a house of a hundred protecting the $80 loan.

634
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:58.680
If you think the housing prices going up and down and might,
you know,

635
00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:01.410
fall below 80 then you're not going to feel very safe.

636
00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:05.640
If you think the housing price is rock solid at 100 you're going to be feel very

637
00:37:05.641 --> 00:37:08.010
safe and you'll leave them alone more than 80 okay.

638
00:37:08.011 --> 00:37:13.011
So the volatility of the housing price obviously is what controls how safe the

639
00:37:13.381 --> 00:37:14.280
lender fields.

640
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:18.000
And so volatility has got to be the most important determinant of leverage.

641
00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:21.420
I'll give it as hard to see how to fit that into a supply and demand equation.

642
00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.310
So the theory,

643
00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:28.200
my theory is going to be that the higher the leverage is which supply and demand

644
00:37:28.201 --> 00:37:31.290
is going to determine,
the higher the asset prices are.

645
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:35.560
And the lower leverage is the lower the asset prices are.
Now.
Why?

646
00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:40.440
Why should this be the case?
Well,
in in,
you know,

647
00:37:40.441 --> 00:37:44.700
as in my view,
there are many different potential buyers,

648
00:37:44.701 --> 00:37:48.690
you know let's say continuum of potential buyers and each of them has a

649
00:37:48.691 --> 00:37:52.830
different view of what the asset is worth.
Some peop,
okay.

650
00:37:52.831 --> 00:37:54.300
And so you have this continuum.

651
00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:59.750
Now let's for simplicity even suppose that everyone in is has a number in his

652
00:38:00.661 --> 00:38:04.020
head about what the asset's worth.
That's what we did in the very first day.

653
00:38:04.021 --> 00:38:06.090
Everyone had a reservation price of the asset.

654
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:10.170
And let's say though that they're willing to buy more than one football ticket,

655
00:38:10.171 --> 00:38:12.990
they're willing to buy as many football tickets as they can get as long as the

656
00:38:12.991 --> 00:38:16.470
price is less than the reservation price.
So what happens,

657
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.290
the people who have the highest valuation,

658
00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:23.310
naturally you're going to buy the assets and the people with low valuations,

659
00:38:23.311 --> 00:38:26.190
they're going to sell them and somewhere there'd be a marginal guy.

660
00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.570
So people above here are going to be the buyers and people below here are going

661
00:38:29.571 --> 00:38:32.040
to be the sellers.
And what's the price going to be?

662
00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:36.430
It's going to be the valuation of this marginal guy.
Because if the price,

663
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:40.090
you know he's marginal precisely because he's a difference between being a buyer

664
00:38:40.091 --> 00:38:42.490
or seller,
which means the price for him is just right.

665
00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:46.030
These guys up here think the price is too low.
That's why they're buyers.

666
00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:49.000
These guys down here,
I think the price is too high.
That's why they're sellers.

667
00:38:49.001 --> 00:38:53.020
So this is all consistent with what we've saw on the football ticket example.

668
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:57.910
Now the one little twist is how many,
where does this have to be?
Well,

669
00:38:57.911 --> 00:39:00.730
it depends on how much money these guys up here have.

670
00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:05.080
So just so Fisher actually said this,
if you make people who are,

671
00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.660
you know really like to consume now richer,

672
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:10.240
you're going to get a different interest rate.
Or if you make,
you know,

673
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:13.060
if you make the patient people richer,
you'll have a lower interest rate.
Well,

674
00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:16.960
the same logic here,
if you make the natural buyers richer,

675
00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:20.830
you're not going to need as many of them to buy the assets in the marginal guy.

676
00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:23.200
We'll go up here and the price will rise.

677
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:25.390
Not because the payoffs of the acid of change,

678
00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:29.080
but because the marginal buyer has gone up.
So to put it,

679
00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:32.950
but in another way,
more important way,

680
00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:36.850
if it's easier to borrow because leverage is higher.

681
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000
So you can buy that hundred dollar house with only $10 down instead of $20 down.

682
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:44.170
Then each of these natural buyers,

683
00:39:44.171 --> 00:39:46.150
instead of being able to afford to buy one house,

684
00:39:46.151 --> 00:39:50.410
can buy two houses or two mortgage securities or buy a house that's twice as
big.

685
00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:53.710
So the natural buyers with a lot of leverage,

686
00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:57.940
you'll only have a few of them will be able to buy all the assets and the

687
00:39:57.941 --> 00:40:01.960
marginal buyer will be very high and the price will be very high.

688
00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.920
If there's no leverage,
no borrowing,
it's going to take a lot of them to buy.

689
00:40:05.921 --> 00:40:06.790
All the assets in.

690
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:09.910
The marginal buyer will be down here and the price will be very low.

691
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:14.770
So leverage is clearly going to affect the price.
Um,

692
00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:19.210
and notice how shocking this is.
You know,
what would Fisher say about this?

693
00:40:19.211 --> 00:40:21.730
So this sounds like such common sense.
How could this be wrong?

694
00:40:21.731 --> 00:40:25.660
It sounds like so obvious.
Okay.
But now why didn't anybody say this before?

695
00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:28.930
Why didn't a fissure say this?
Cause remember what Fisher said?

696
00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:33.880
He said the price of every acid is the fundamental value of the,

697
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:36.280
um,
of the cashflows.

698
00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:41.310
You take the future cash flows and you discount them by the interest rate say,

699
00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:43.150
and that's what the price is.

700
00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.210
I'm saying even if the interest rate doesn't change,

701
00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:48.190
you just change the amount of leverage.

702
00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:50.950
So these natural buyers at the top are going to be able,

703
00:40:50.951 --> 00:40:53.470
fewer of them are going to be able to buy all the assets,

704
00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:55.810
then that's gonna make the price higher.

705
00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:59.170
So the price is not going to be equal to the fundamental value.
In fact,
there is,

706
00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.820
there isn't a fundamental value.

707
00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:03.490
It all depends on the different opinions of the different people.

708
00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:05.680
So what are the reasons they differ?

709
00:41:05.681 --> 00:41:10.090
Why should there be people who disagree about what the value is?

710
00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:15.280
I think that there are basically four reasons or five reasons for them anyway,

711
00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:19.990
are one,
these people,
um,

712
00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:25.060
let's say are more risk tolerant than the people down here.

713
00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:28.750
So the people down here are so scared to hold these assets because they might

714
00:41:28.751 --> 00:41:33.190
pay low numbers,
low payoffs in some states and high payoffs and other states.

715
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:38.540
Okay.
So that,
that assumes that they can't insure themselves against everything.

716
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:42.170
So that's another,
another crucial ingredient to my period,

717
00:41:42.171 --> 00:41:44.690
which I'm not going to,
you know,
in the background here is the idea.

718
00:41:44.691 --> 00:41:46.220
There's not insurance for everything.

719
00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:50.970
So the acid here is going to be regarded as risky if it pays,
uh,

720
00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:54.380
in,
uh,
in a Lowe's,
you know,
less than some states than other.

721
00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:57.740
So because some people are less risk averse,
they're more risk tolerant,

722
00:41:57.741 --> 00:42:00.230
they're going to be willing to pay more for the asset.
That's one reason.

723
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.100
Another reason is these people won't just be more optimistic than these people.

724
00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:09.170
So far we've assumed that everybody believed in the same probabilities.

725
00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:13.400
What if these guys,
probability of the upstate is always higher than these guys?

726
00:42:13.401 --> 00:42:14.570
Probably the upstate.

727
00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:17.360
Then they're going to be willing to pay more than these guys are.

728
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:21.680
Another reason it might be these people simply like the assets they like living

729
00:42:21.681 --> 00:42:24.980
in the house.
These people are the New York bankers,
they're just lending money.

730
00:42:24.981 --> 00:42:27.680
They couldn't care less about living in the house,
the house to them,

731
00:42:27.681 --> 00:42:29.750
it's just a source of income for these people.

732
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:32.990
They really want to live in the house.
So another thing could be,

733
00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:37.260
some people just have more expertise.
They know how to read all these,
you know,

734
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:39.860
statements of,
of a loan,
you know,
they can,

735
00:42:39.861 --> 00:42:43.540
they can analyze the loan level data and these people don't have the time or you

736
00:42:43.541 --> 00:42:44.030
know,

737
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:47.930
it gives them a headache or they don't know how to find the loan level data to

738
00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:51.620
go through house by House,
who the homeowners are and how reliable they are.

739
00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:54.200
So naturally they're going to be a scared of mine because they're going to

740
00:42:54.201 --> 00:42:56.540
figure these guys know more than they do.
Okay.

741
00:42:56.541 --> 00:42:59.750
So these are all different reasons why some people would be willing to pay more

742
00:42:59.751 --> 00:43:04.490
than other people.
Okay.
And so,
um,

743
00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:06.860
so therefore,
as I say in the standard theory,

744
00:43:06.861 --> 00:43:09.830
the acid price is supposed to be the fundamental value.

745
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:13.700
We don't talk very much about the heterogeneity of the people and how that makes

746
00:43:13.701 --> 00:43:17.660
the definition of fundamental value are hard to maintain.
So in my theory,

747
00:43:17.661 --> 00:43:18.494
in short,

748
00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:23.090
in Echo Librium in normal times or good times,

749
00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:27.560
there's going to be too much leverage and therefore to high asset prices and in

750
00:43:27.561 --> 00:43:31.130
bad times there's going to be too little leverage and therefore to low acid

751
00:43:31.131 --> 00:43:33.560
prices in this recurs over and over again.

752
00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:36.590
And it's what I call the leverage cycle,
what I called the levered cycle.

753
00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:40.130
Now let me give you an example of what people really had to pay for these
things.

754
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:45.670
So for a bank buying a AAA security,

755
00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:47.570
the uh,

756
00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:52.600
there's regulation which forces them to put a certain amount of cash down.

757
00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.440
Okay?
So you know,

758
00:43:54.441 --> 00:43:57.920
they have their depositors money so they can buy things with depositors' money,

759
00:43:57.921 --> 00:44:00.350
but they have to put some of their own capital down.

760
00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:05.620
So how much do they have to put down 1.6% so they could leverage 60 to $100

761
00:44:06.981 --> 00:44:09.470
assets.
They only paid $1.60 in cash.

762
00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:13.430
If you look at all the so called toxic mortgage securities,

763
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:15.380
of which there were two and a half trillion,

764
00:44:15.381 --> 00:44:19.160
these are the things that crushed all the banks that they suppose that they
held.

765
00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:24.370
I went through security by security and made a guess as to how much cash was put

766
00:44:24.921 --> 00:44:28.310
down by the buyer of each of those securities.
And on average I got,

767
00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:30.980
so this is not absolutely accurate.
There are a lot of,

768
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:33.630
but I got 16 to one is the leverage.

769
00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:36.930
So that men that if that number's right,

770
00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:42.050
it means $150 billion of cash was paid and 2.3 5 trillion was borrowed.

771
00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:48.720
Okay?
That's 16 to one leverage.
So that means that,
you know,
think about it,

772
00:44:48.721 --> 00:44:53.721
Bill Gates and Warren Buffet to people by themselves in 2006 had almost $150

773
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:57.180
billion.
Does that mean it's two guys?

774
00:44:57.181 --> 00:45:01.530
And the whole economy could have bought every single toxic mortgage security

775
00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:04.260
because they could have borrowed the rest of the money they needed to buy.

776
00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:06.510
So when you think of where this line is,

777
00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:09.300
what I'm saying is that for all the mortgage securities,

778
00:45:09.301 --> 00:45:14.220
all the toxic mortgage securities in the sub prime loans,
you know,
the all day,

779
00:45:14.221 --> 00:45:16.350
all those supposedly dangerous securities,

780
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:20.520
you could have had the marginal buyer way up here.
That's all that was required.

781
00:45:20.521 --> 00:45:24.600
Those are the only number of people.
This top little echelon of people bought.

782
00:45:24.601 --> 00:45:27.810
All those securities could have bought all the securities because they had

783
00:45:27.811 --> 00:45:31.680
enough money to do it.
Okay.
And they hired the end to put anything down.

784
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:35.580
So if you look at the same was true with a housing.

785
00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:39.960
Now let's look at uh,
this theory a little bit.
So I,
I should have,

786
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.780
sorry,
I could have put this in a bit of a thing.
Okay.
So I use,

787
00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:47.250
I give all these talks with Schiller first alumni and you know,

788
00:45:47.251 --> 00:45:50.220
during the crisis,
we haven't given one in a while,
but there was,
you know,

789
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:51.601
lots of them,

790
00:45:51.601 --> 00:45:54.230
like every month or two months we'd be giving one of these talks and they'd

791
00:45:54.231 --> 00:45:58.890
bring in all these donors to say,
you know,
Yale need your money now.

792
00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:04.530
And they'd say,
we don't have any money.
So anyhow,

793
00:46:04.531 --> 00:46:05.251
I'm just joking.

794
00:46:05.251 --> 00:46:08.430
So we'd have a lot of these talks and Schiller would always put up the green

795
00:46:08.431 --> 00:46:11.220
graph.
So on the right hand side,
I showed you this before,

796
00:46:11.221 --> 00:46:15.570
it's his famous diagram.
He did a brilliant thing.

797
00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.290
He decided to collect data on every transaction.

798
00:46:19.291 --> 00:46:21.120
Every time someone purchased a house,

799
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:25.080
he'd keep track of it because it's all public information and then compare it to

800
00:46:25.081 --> 00:46:28.830
the same house there was sold before and do a few other tricks.

801
00:46:28.831 --> 00:46:33.630
I don't have time to explain to make an index of the housing prices in the whole

802
00:46:33.631 --> 00:46:38.550
country.
And so he done this going back many years,

803
00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:42.600
but starting in 2000 and the thing that he called attention to before anybody

804
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:44.730
said,
look at this,
look at this line.

805
00:46:44.731 --> 00:46:49.731
The housing price index from 2000 to 2006 it's gone up by almost a hundred

806
00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:55.560
percent the housing index was 102,000 when it started.

807
00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.670
That's 110 sorry,
this is a hundred.

808
00:46:58.671 --> 00:47:03.671
It's a 100 when it started here in 2000 and it goes up to 190 and 2006 says 90%

809
00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:08.490
in six years,
you know,

810
00:47:08.491 --> 00:47:13.470
that's a to to almost double in six years.
That means it's gone up.

811
00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:18.480
Um,
you know,
12% a year or something.
Okay.

812
00:47:18.481 --> 00:47:22.230
So a staggering increase in the price of housing.
And so,

813
00:47:22.231 --> 00:47:23.460
and then it started to go down.

814
00:47:23.461 --> 00:47:27.360
So he called attention to this already as it was coming up.
So,
you know,
in 2004,

815
00:47:27.361 --> 00:47:31.480
2005 it was saying,
my gosh,
there's a bubble.
It's going crazy.
And he'd say,

816
00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:34.540
everybody's nuts.
You know,
the people and Americans,

817
00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:38.440
that's irrational exuberance and people are so crazy that they just think things

818
00:47:38.441 --> 00:47:41.440
are always going to go up on the price is going up higher and higher and higher.

819
00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:44.260
And then,
you know,
when it got so high,
the narrative changed.

820
00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:47.500
People started getting worried and they started telling everyone the world was

821
00:47:47.501 --> 00:47:50.620
coming to an end and the prices went down and down and down because we have

822
00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:53.650
irrational exuberance.
And you know,
things are picking up a little bit,

823
00:47:53.651 --> 00:47:56.680
but we don't know whether people are irrationally exuberant or pessimistic or

824
00:47:56.681 --> 00:48:01.350
they're blipping.
But anyway,
they're irrational.
So I say,
uh,

825
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:04.750
so that's a story that has certain compelling nature to it and he deserves a lot

826
00:48:04.751 --> 00:48:07.990
of credit for calling attention to it.
But in my story,

827
00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:11.440
I s I say these prices are related to leverage.
So let's,

828
00:48:11.441 --> 00:48:16.060
so I went through every loan.
A loan by loan that wasn't a,

829
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:19.570
uh,
wasn't a government loans.
These are private loans.

830
00:48:19.571 --> 00:48:23.260
You can't get the data and government loans.
So I'm private loans,
you know,

831
00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:27.520
every time someone took out a mortgage,
you have to,
you know,
they put it into a,

832
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.020
you know,
they were selling the loan.
So therefore they publish the data.
You had,

833
00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:35.140
you know,
what the,
what the,
uh,
the,
uh,

834
00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:37.510
the appraised value of the house was,

835
00:48:37.511 --> 00:48:40.000
or the sale price if they were buying it for the first time.

836
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:42.700
And you know what all the loans are.
So I wrote it,

837
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:47.790
I added up the value of other loans and I divided it by the price of the house.

838
00:48:48.191 --> 00:48:51.880
And I subtracted it off to get what the down payment was,
the cash down payment.

839
00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:55.570
So this is 2% down,
4% down,
6% down.

840
00:48:55.720 --> 00:49:00.690
Or if you take 100% minus this,
this is,
you know,
the loan to value.

841
00:49:00.691 --> 00:49:03.850
So this is 100% you haven't borrowed everything here.

842
00:49:03.851 --> 00:49:06.910
You borrowed 98% of the value of 96% of the house,

843
00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:10.360
94% of the house,
et Cetera.
Okay,

844
00:49:10.361 --> 00:49:14.620
so in 2000 these are not,
these are slightly riskier people.

845
00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:18.730
They're amazingly,
they're putting down 14% okay?

846
00:49:18.730 --> 00:49:22.450
Now that automates and they're putting down 14% so it's seven to one leverage.

847
00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:24.010
But then look what happened.

848
00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.830
The leverage went up and up and up and up and up and up.

849
00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:32.050
And then it was in 2006 less than 3% down.

850
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:34.360
These people were 30 to one leveraged.

851
00:49:34.361 --> 00:49:38.950
I said the securities market was 16 to one leverage the triple a part 60 to one

852
00:49:38.951 --> 00:49:43.810
leverage.
Here there are 30 to one leverage.
And so the prices went up.
But yes,

853
00:49:43.811 --> 00:49:46.440
the prices went up because the leverage went up.
It was so easy,

854
00:49:46.441 --> 00:49:48.160
you hardly had to put any money down.

855
00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:51.910
That's why people were willing to pay some to buy such expensive houses because

856
00:49:51.911 --> 00:49:54.700
they weren't actually putting that much money down.
Okay.

857
00:49:54.701 --> 00:49:58.540
And then leverage collapsed like this and you had to put more and more money

858
00:49:58.541 --> 00:50:01.630
down and then the whole market for non,
you know,

859
00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:05.230
you can't get a loan basically anymore unless you're getting a government log.

860
00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:08.980
And so leverage collapsed and the housing prices went down.
You know,

861
00:50:08.981 --> 00:50:12.010
leverage was collapsing faster and in front of housing prices.

862
00:50:12.011 --> 00:50:13.450
So I think it's the leverage,

863
00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:17.470
which is a crucial determinant of the price and not irrational exuberance,

864
00:50:17.471 --> 00:50:19.330
although I think there is irrational exuberance,

865
00:50:19.331 --> 00:50:22.960
but I think leverage is what's underneath it and more basic.

866
00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:26.110
Now let's do the same thing with prices.
So these,

867
00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:30.830
we did the prime index before this red line is the prime index.

868
00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:34.940
So talking about things at the very,
not subprime homeowners,

869
00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:39.650
but prime people with brilliant credit ratings and stuff.
So even now,

870
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:42.560
you know,
years,
three years after the crisis has started,

871
00:50:42.561 --> 00:50:46.610
the losses on these pools are still in the single digits.
Okay.

872
00:50:46.611 --> 00:50:51.560
5% 6% things like that.
And most of these,
uh,
8% maybe,

873
00:50:51.561 --> 00:50:55.410
and most of these,
these are the trip,
the top piece of a pool of,

874
00:50:55.490 --> 00:51:00.440
of prime borrowers.
So most of these loans are,
um,
you know,

875
00:51:00.441 --> 00:51:04.070
they're protected by 8% of a,
you know,
the,
the,
the bottom piece.

876
00:51:04.071 --> 00:51:08.660
So you have to go through 8% losses before you touch them at all.
So it's,

877
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:13.280
it's just inconceivable that you'd see 40% losses.

878
00:51:13.281 --> 00:51:18.200
But so what happened,
these bonds were at a hundred.
This is a 100 over here.

879
00:51:18.201 --> 00:51:21.380
The price is a hundred.
Okay?
They're at a hundred now.

880
00:51:21.381 --> 00:51:25.490
The interest rate is changing and the prices are going up and down because

881
00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:26.780
they're supposed to be floaters,

882
00:51:26.781 --> 00:51:29.120
which always pay more or less depending on the interest rates.

883
00:51:29.121 --> 00:51:33.020
So they should be locked in at a hundred but they're not floating exactly on the

884
00:51:33.021 --> 00:51:35.960
same time.
You know,
they don't change their float so fast.

885
00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:39.080
So the price is going up and down because of that.

886
00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:41.990
But it's clear that nobody thinks they're going to be any losses.

887
00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:46.670
And then all of a sudden in 2007 but later,

888
00:51:46.671 --> 00:51:49.760
this is much later than the subprime market collapsed.

889
00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:55.160
These prices collapsed and they collapse all the way to 60.
Shocking.

890
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:56.750
It's just inconceivable.

891
00:51:56.751 --> 00:52:00.740
I think that people could have thought they're going to be 40% losses or that

892
00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:04.670
everybody could have thought they're going to be 40% losses and then they've

893
00:52:04.671 --> 00:52:07.700
shot back up to 80 so there's been a huge gains.

894
00:52:07.701 --> 00:52:11.360
If you look at a typical hedge fund like Ellington,

895
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:15.050
you'll see that we lost a lot of money and now we've made a huge amount of
money.

896
00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:20.120
Okay,
now where did a,
so that was not such brilliant hedging,
but uh,
anyway,

897
00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:24.350
so,
but now why did these prices collapse and go back up is that people were just

898
00:52:24.351 --> 00:52:27.350
got totally irrationally pessimistic and then some,
and then they said,
oh,

899
00:52:27.351 --> 00:52:30.080
things can't really be that bad and things got better.
Well,

900
00:52:30.081 --> 00:52:34.520
let's look at the leverage.
Okay,
what is the down payment?

901
00:52:34.521 --> 00:52:38.510
The same thing as before on AAA securities.
Now,
amazingly,

902
00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:41.720
the Fed has never kept these numbers,
so,

903
00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.780
and they're still not keeping these numbers.
So I,

904
00:52:44.781 --> 00:52:49.781
I testified in front of Ben Bernanki and the Board of governors in October,

905
00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:51.093
2008.
Uh,

906
00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:56.240
there were several of us suppose for four and a half hours and to,
you know,

907
00:52:56.241 --> 00:52:57.710
and I showed them this graph.

908
00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:01.310
So this graph is at my hedge fund Ellington.

909
00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:05.690
It's a for just a bunch of securities that were used to trading.

910
00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:10.610
It's how much they were offering to lend us with the down payment was they were

911
00:53:10.611 --> 00:53:13.370
insisting if we want it to leverage as much as we could.

912
00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.320
So we didn't leverage anything like that,

913
00:53:15.321 --> 00:53:18.260
but this is what they were offering us on the kinds of securities that were

914
00:53:18.261 --> 00:53:19.580
interested in.
Okay.

915
00:53:19.581 --> 00:53:22.220
So this is not the greatest data because we're only looking at what we're

916
00:53:22.221 --> 00:53:26.250
interested in and we're only looking at the offers made to.
So,

917
00:53:26.251 --> 00:53:29.310
but look what happened in [inaudible] 98 when there was a leverage crisis.

918
00:53:29.311 --> 00:53:30.270
That was the last one.

919
00:53:30.271 --> 00:53:33.780
I must've skipped a slide where I said the last leverage cycle ended in

920
00:53:33.781 --> 00:53:37.530
[inaudible] 98.
It was 10% down.

921
00:53:37.531 --> 00:53:41.460
That means 10 to one leverage.
Then suddenly it went to 40% down.

922
00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:44.280
So leverage drastically dropped the down payment,

923
00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:48.600
the margin radically increased for a few months during the crisis,

924
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:53.320
then went back to 10% then we had 10% down for a long time.

925
00:53:53.321 --> 00:53:54.330
That's 10 to one leverage.

926
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:58.860
And then for a couple of years it became five to one leverage.
So 20 to one,

927
00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:03.540
five to one,
sorry,
5% down,
it means 22 one leverage.

928
00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:05.890
Okay.
And so,
you know,
the,

929
00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:10.900
the leverage has drastically increased and then leverage suddenly started

930
00:54:11.581 --> 00:54:15.330
collapsing and lenders ask for more and more down payments,

931
00:54:15.331 --> 00:54:19.230
more and more down payments.
And leverage was just collapsing.
Okay.

932
00:54:19.231 --> 00:54:22.200
And the prices,
it happened ahead of the prices.

933
00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:26.000
And then leverage actually picked up here and went down again.
And then this,

934
00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:29.640
this graph is quite old now.
May,
I should've gotten an updated it.

935
00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:33.180
Leverage has gone way up again and the prices have gone way up.
So you see,

936
00:54:33.181 --> 00:54:36.030
leverage goes down,
the prices go down,
leverage goes up,

937
00:54:36.031 --> 00:54:39.660
the prices go up and leverage is still heading up and the prices are much
higher.

938
00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:44.040
So that's my,
my view,
it's leveraged.
That's determining a lot of these things.

939
00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:48.360
Okay.
And,
uh,
all right.
So as I said,
there's recurring leverage cycles.

940
00:54:48.361 --> 00:54:51.390
In 1998,
there was a leverage cycle.

941
00:54:51.391 --> 00:54:55.110
That's when longterm capitols or as a book on the collapse of longterm capital

942
00:54:55.111 --> 00:54:58.490
that Lowenstein wrote that's on the reading list.
Before that was Orange County.

943
00:54:58.510 --> 00:55:02.010
Remember my from kidder Peabody went out of business,
uh,

944
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:05.760
in 1994 and uh,
you know,
the end of 94,

945
00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:09.870
the beginning of 94,
orange county got bankrupted.
Um,

946
00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:14.910
partly thanks to buying securities from kidder Peabody.
And uh,
so that was,

947
00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:15.211
you know,

948
00:55:15.211 --> 00:55:18.210
some of you may live in Orange County in any case that was the derivatives

949
00:55:18.211 --> 00:55:21.780
crisis and there was a 1987,
there was a stock market crash.
So anyway,

950
00:55:21.781 --> 00:55:22.860
it's hard to document,

951
00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:28.040
document all the historical leverage cycles because the Fed has never kept this

952
00:55:28.261 --> 00:55:31.320
data and most other firms don't keep their historical data.

953
00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:36.530
We'd Ellington realized after 98 that this was a huge problem leverage.

954
00:55:36.541 --> 00:55:38.280
And so we kept all the historical data.

955
00:55:38.281 --> 00:55:41.820
That's when I wrote my first paper on leverage and collateral and that being a

956
00:55:41.821 --> 00:55:43.020
crucial ingredient,
the department.

957
00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:46.410
So we have this data and practically nobody else has.
So for me,

958
00:55:46.411 --> 00:55:47.520
the most important thing,

959
00:55:47.521 --> 00:55:52.080
the first step the Fed should do is keep track of the leverage that's being

960
00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:53.041
asked,
you know,

961
00:55:53.041 --> 00:55:56.250
allowed for the margins that are being demanded on every security,

962
00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:00.240
housing and securities.
And I heard this talk,

963
00:56:00.241 --> 00:56:04.740
I told you last night on the collapse of the electric grid in,
in uh,

964
00:56:04.890 --> 00:56:09.090
2003.
And so I said,
well,
you know,
what was your,

965
00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:11.790
what have you done?
Obviously the obvious question every one to know.

966
00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:13.680
So what have you done to make it safer?
And they said,

967
00:56:13.681 --> 00:56:18.681
the one thing they did is now they've spent tens and tens of millions of dollars

968
00:56:19.021 --> 00:56:23.860
getting more data.
So they now monitor every single power line in real time.

969
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:24.911
They were,

970
00:56:24.911 --> 00:56:28.210
they had farmed that out to other people before and they weren't very careful

971
00:56:28.211 --> 00:56:31.270
about it.
Now they're incredibly careful about monitoring every single line.

972
00:56:31.271 --> 00:56:32.890
So as soon as one line goes down,

973
00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:37.300
they switched the electricity and they move it evenly across a bunch of other

974
00:56:37.301 --> 00:56:38.020
lines.

975
00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:42.480
In the old days when a power line went down the grid automatically that sorta

976
00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:46.450
electricity when the power went to the next closest place and that would

977
00:56:46.451 --> 00:56:49.000
overload the next closest one and maybe make that one go down.

978
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.650
Now if they know it's gone down,
they,
you know,
they choose how to read divided.

979
00:56:53.651 --> 00:56:55.270
I mean it's automatic,
you know,
dividing them up.

980
00:56:55.450 --> 00:56:58.600
But the point is you can't do all that without information and they're spending

981
00:56:58.601 --> 00:57:02.560
tens of millions of dollars monitoring everything and we still are not

982
00:57:02.561 --> 00:57:06.640
monitoring what leverage is.
I think it's a shocking,
a shocking thing.

983
00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:11.020
We should be monitoring leverage and then we should be regulating it.

984
00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:14.740
And instead we haven't even begun to monitor it much less to figured out how to

985
00:57:14.741 --> 00:57:17.170
regulate it.
Now,
why was the leverage cycle,

986
00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:20.950
I said this recurs over and over again.

987
00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:25.900
So why was the leverage cycles so bad in this time than it was before?

988
00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:30.820
So this is my short version.
I have a long,
um,
uh,
version of this.

989
00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:35.020
The short version is because leverage got a higher than it ever did before.

990
00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:38.020
And there are lots of reasons why leveraged got higher than it ever did before.

991
00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:41.860
We had this period of low volatility for a long time.
Okay.

992
00:57:41.861 --> 00:57:46.180
So that made it higher.
We then,
um,
w w we then had securitization,

993
00:57:46.181 --> 00:57:48.770
which we didn't have before.
So you know,
uh,
uh,

994
00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:53.980
subprime borrower would have had to put down a huge down payment in the old days

995
00:57:54.761 --> 00:57:57.610
because people would have regarded it as such a risky thing.

996
00:57:57.910 --> 00:58:01.960
But once we packaged all the sub prime loans together and a big security,

997
00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:05.740
and you could,
you know,
the triple AAA guy got the best of the houses,

998
00:58:05.741 --> 00:58:08.440
not each house,
not a share of every house,

999
00:58:08.441 --> 00:58:10.300
but only a share of the very best houses.

1000
00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:12.820
It all of a sudden became a much safer loan.

1001
00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:17.290
And so as you could borrow a lot more money against it,
okay.

1002
00:58:17.291 --> 00:58:20.710
Against that AAA loan.
So if it's,
so the,
the triple a piece,

1003
00:58:20.711 --> 00:58:22.990
using that as collateral,
you could borrow a lot of money.

1004
00:58:23.110 --> 00:58:24.950
Whereas using a single sub prime,

1005
00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:28.180
a big percentage of the price of the triple a thing you could borrow.

1006
00:58:28.330 --> 00:58:31.480
Whereas if you had a single subprime loan,
people would never lend more than,

1007
00:58:31.481 --> 00:58:34.450
you know,
50% of the value of the house or something.
Okay.

1008
00:58:34.451 --> 00:58:38.890
The second reason why things were so bad was because we had a double levered

1009
00:58:38.891 --> 00:58:41.320
cycle.
We had leveraged shooting through the roof,

1010
00:58:41.321 --> 00:58:45.430
not just insecurities as it had before.
As I showed you a 98 or you know,

1011
00:58:45.431 --> 00:58:50.200
it was at 10% down and then it was a collapse to 40% down in the back of the 10%

1012
00:58:50.201 --> 00:58:54.760
down.
That was a big change.
You know,
in the crisis stage,
leverage collapsed.

1013
00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:58.780
But here we had an housing as well where there is a feedback between the two.

1014
00:58:58.930 --> 00:59:03.220
So why is it that all these people stopped being able to refinance their loans

1015
00:59:03.370 --> 00:59:06.490
in 2007 which contributed so much to the losses?

1016
00:59:06.730 --> 00:59:09.790
It's not because they,
um,

1017
00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:14.350
it's not because the interest rates were suddenly too high for them.

1018
00:59:14.351 --> 00:59:15.430
Those didn't change at all.

1019
00:59:15.431 --> 00:59:19.840
It's that the lenders suddenly demanded a much bigger down payment instead of 3%

1020
00:59:19.841 --> 00:59:23.660
down.
They had to put 25% down and they couldn't afford to do it.

1021
00:59:23.661 --> 00:59:25.190
So they couldn't refinance their loan,

1022
00:59:25.191 --> 00:59:28.100
they didn't have the cash so that we're stuck with the old loan.

1023
00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:31.460
And so the original lender was in much more jeopardy.
Okay.

1024
00:59:31.461 --> 00:59:35.240
And then the last thing is the cds market.
So I have to explain,

1025
00:59:35.241 --> 00:59:39.050
this is why it's going to spill over into next time.
So these insurance things,

1026
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:43.670
there are many ways of interpreting what they did and why they were so
dangerous.

1027
00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:46.040
But one of them is that they,
um,

1028
00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:49.520
they allowed people to write insurance to lose huge amounts of money,

1029
00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:52.640
but more interest.
Okay.
So that's an obvious thing.

1030
00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:56.240
That's why the losses were so big,
but more interesting than that.
They,

1031
00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:01.670
they allowed the pessimists to leverage themselves because in our old story from

1032
01:00:01.671 --> 01:00:05.960
way back here and this old story,
um,

1033
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:11.090
where was the old story with that in this story?

1034
01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:14.840
Remember I said that the,
you know,
the natural buyers,

1035
01:00:14.841 --> 01:00:17.630
you'd have fewer of them if they could leverage a lot.
Okay.

1036
01:00:17.631 --> 01:00:19.520
So what were these guys down here and doing?
Well,

1037
01:00:19.521 --> 01:00:23.180
they couldn't do anything except sell the assets and maybe make the loans.

1038
01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:26.090
There was no way they're negative.
You know,
the price got higher and higher.

1039
01:00:26.091 --> 01:00:29.360
These guys down here presumably are getting more and more disgusted and
thinking,

1040
01:00:29.361 --> 01:00:32.060
well this mark,
it's ridiculous.
I mean the price is way too high.

1041
01:00:32.061 --> 01:00:35.150
We don't want to buy here.
And I've talked to a lot of uh,

1042
01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:40.130
insurance companies like Northwestern mutual life.
The Guy who runs that,
uh,

1043
01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:41.750
they,
they,
you know,
he said,

1044
01:00:41.751 --> 01:00:45.440
we used to be a big buyer of mortgage securities and subprime mortgages and

1045
01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:50.090
stuff in 2004 and the price got so high in 2006 to us it became ridiculous.

1046
01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:53.720
We just dropped out of the market.
But dropping out of the market is one thing.

1047
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:56.180
What if they could bet against the market?
Well,

1048
01:00:56.181 --> 01:00:58.460
they had no opportunity to do that before.

1049
01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:00.440
They couldn't express their negative view.

1050
01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:05.680
But starting in 2005 where this a cds market really took off with a cds market

1051
01:01:08.781 --> 01:01:13.340
really took off.
They could suddenly express their negative view.
So in my view,

1052
01:01:13.341 --> 01:01:17.420
in my opinion,
what happened was that at the end of 2005,

1053
01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:22.490
the pessimists for the first time,
we're able to bet on the market going down.

1054
01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:27.260
And so that's what started to make prices go down because of the cds market,

1055
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:29.330
when prices started to go down,

1056
01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:33.710
the mortgage securities that had been sold with all that leverage for high

1057
01:01:33.711 --> 01:01:36.230
prices started to go down in price.

1058
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:39.860
That meant that new securitizations weren't worth it.

1059
01:01:39.861 --> 01:01:42.530
You couldn't make the profit that we were talking about before.
You know,

1060
01:01:42.531 --> 01:01:44.720
putting all these things together and selling off the bonds,

1061
01:01:44.721 --> 01:01:46.580
the bonds are being sold for a lower price.

1062
01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:51.090
You couldn't lend all that money to these people by borrow,
by,
by,
you know,
you,

1063
01:01:51.091 --> 01:01:53.840
you weren't getting the money to lend to the people by selling the bonds.

1064
01:01:53.841 --> 01:01:55.550
If you sell the bonds at a lower price,

1065
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:57.410
you don't have the money to lend to the people.

1066
01:01:57.590 --> 01:02:02.000
So in order to make the bonds sell for a higher price,

1067
01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:06.830
they demanded that the homeowners put up more collateral.
And so that's why,

1068
01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:09.560
um,
that's how things,
uh,
and,

1069
01:02:09.570 --> 01:02:13.310
and then that meant the homeowner's couldn't refinance and then that started to

1070
01:02:13.311 --> 01:02:17.180
make the world more dangerous.
And that's why then on securities,
the,

1071
01:02:17.181 --> 01:02:20.880
the lenders on securities reduce the leverage and the whole thing started to

1072
01:02:20.881 --> 01:02:25.830
spiral.
That's my story of how the thing started.
So let's,
uh,

1073
01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:30.240
say that in the bottom of the leverage cycle for the same bad three things

1074
01:02:30.241 --> 01:02:32.280
always happen.
Number one,

1075
01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:37.230
they're scary bad news that creates more uncertainty and more disagreement.
Okay?

1076
01:02:37.231 --> 01:02:40.680
So it wasn't just that people thought that losses,

1077
01:02:40.681 --> 01:02:44.970
we're going to go from 40% to 20% on subprime mortgages.

1078
01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:50.120
It's that they went from 4% expected with a range of one to 5% to 30%,

1079
01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:56.640
but maybe they would be 80% the losses.
There was a huge v volatility.
You know,

1080
01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:58.530
nobody really knew what the hell is going to happen.

1081
01:02:58.531 --> 01:03:01.680
They had to extrapolate those curves.
How do you know how to extrapolate,

1082
01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:04.830
you know,
for,
for,
for a decade the curves have been flat.

1083
01:03:04.831 --> 01:03:06.390
Suddenly they're starting to accelerate.

1084
01:03:06.391 --> 01:03:10.260
How do you know how to extrapolate them as huge uncertainty and because you
know,

1085
01:03:10.261 --> 01:03:13.830
huge volatility and so naturally the lenders are going to be much more nervous

1086
01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:16.920
and lend only with much more collateral.

1087
01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:19.500
Once the lenders lend with much more collateral,

1088
01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:22.680
those people at the top can't afford to buy things anymore.

1089
01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:27.060
They're going to have to sell.
Okay.
And uh,
so there's d leveraging,
sorry.

1090
01:03:27.061 --> 01:03:29.100
And the people at the top are going to have to sell,

1091
01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:33.470
but the price is going to go down.
And because they borrowed money,
you know,
and,

1092
01:03:33.471 --> 01:03:36.030
and using an acid as collateral,
their leverage,

1093
01:03:36.031 --> 01:03:39.300
we talk about that their losses are going to be gigantic because they're betting

1094
01:03:39.301 --> 01:03:41.550
essentially on things going up and things are going down.

1095
01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:45.510
So they lost a huge amount of money.
Okay.
So this is always the same thing.

1096
01:03:45.511 --> 01:03:48.210
There's scary bad news.
Margins get tougher.

1097
01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:51.930
And the most optimistic leveraged buyers are the ones who got crushed as they

1098
01:03:51.931 --> 01:03:55.680
were betting on things going up and they go bankrupt.
Okay.

1099
01:03:55.681 --> 01:04:00.480
So now what's so bad about this?
Um,
I'm running out of time here.

1100
01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:04.920
Uh,
okay.
And I haven't gotten to how the math is going to change.

1101
01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:07.350
So what's so bad?
So I,
okay,

1102
01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.840
so I'm going to talk for four more minutes and hand back the exams.

1103
01:04:09.841 --> 01:04:14.640
Or should I just hand back the exams right now?
What do you,
are you
okay?

1104
01:04:14.641 --> 01:04:18.030
I'll talk for more minutes.
Some of you aren't going to come next time.
Um,

1105
01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:20.100
so I'm going to do how the math maybe most of you.

1106
01:04:20.101 --> 01:04:21.900
So I'll do have the math changes next time.

1107
01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:24.000
So what's so bad about the leverage cycle?

1108
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:28.140
So let's just think about what all the bad things that happen.
Number one,

1109
01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:33.000
you can have a tiny group of people if the top controlling the price cause they

1110
01:04:33.001 --> 01:04:36.630
can borrow so much money.
Now we've always assumed that everybody was rational.

1111
01:04:36.631 --> 01:04:40.500
What if these buyers are kind of crazy?
A few guys can,
can,

1112
01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:45.180
can make the price skyrocket because they can borrow so much money.
Okay.

1113
01:04:45.330 --> 01:04:48.720
Now once they do that and they're making the prices of acids skyrocket,

1114
01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.610
people are going to build more of those assets.

1115
01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:54.060
So they're going to use real resources to build projects that are probably,

1116
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:57.810
you know,
crazy and are going to be very costly to reversed.
Okay.
But,

1117
01:04:58.170 --> 01:05:00.660
but let's leave aside now people being crazy.

1118
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:05.100
What else happens in the leverage cycle?
Well,
in the leverage cycle,

1119
01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:08.610
when you're leveraged a lot,
as we,
as we said,
you know,
that's going on the,

1120
01:05:08.850 --> 01:05:13.350
on the Tobin diagram to the right,
it's like borrowing money to bet in the,
uh,

1121
01:05:13.650 --> 01:05:15.900
in the stocks.
That means if the stocks go up,

1122
01:05:15.901 --> 01:05:19.600
you multiply your winnings of the stock goes down,
you multiply your losses.

1123
01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:24.400
So on the leverage cycle,
people who are lucky if things keep going up,

1124
01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:28.030
they get incredibly rich.
You know,
it's a tremendous mystery in economics.

1125
01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:32.170
Why is it that inequality,
uh,
you know,
increase so much?
Well,

1126
01:05:32.171 --> 01:05:34.720
one of the reasons I think is the leverage cycle that,
you know,

1127
01:05:34.721 --> 01:05:36.880
people were betting and making more and more money.

1128
01:05:37.090 --> 01:05:40.810
And so that's why inequality was as helping to spread inequality.

1129
01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:43.060
Now another thing is the worst.

1130
01:05:43.061 --> 01:05:46.810
Probably the biggest problem is that once the asset prices fall,

1131
01:05:47.050 --> 01:05:51.760
everything gets hard to do.
So if you want to get a new credit card,

1132
01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:52.900
who's,

1133
01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:56.710
what does it mean to get a credit card is it means you sell your promise right

1134
01:05:56.711 --> 01:06:01.300
to a buyer.
Now,
why should a buyer by your promise for a hundred,

1135
01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:03.640
you know,
you're promising to pay back in the future.

1136
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:07.150
So he's paying a hundred for you when the very same promise that someone made

1137
01:06:07.151 --> 01:06:12.151
six months ago is selling for 65 because the prices of all collapsed,

1138
01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:15.400
they're not going to buy the new promises when they can buy.

1139
01:06:15.401 --> 01:06:17.290
The old promises is such a low price.

1140
01:06:17.291 --> 01:06:20.920
Who's going to buy a new mortgage when the old mortgages or selling at 65?

1141
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:25.330
Who's going to buy a new auto loan when the old auto loans are selling so low so

1142
01:06:25.331 --> 01:06:28.510
nobody can get a new loan,
nobody can get a new,
uh,
you know,

1143
01:06:28.511 --> 01:06:32.030
can sell a new promise and no business can sell its promise.

1144
01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:35.950
Their old businesses that everybody understands that or who's bonds are out

1145
01:06:35.951 --> 01:06:37.810
there being traded at very low prices,

1146
01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:41.290
the investors are going to all by the old assets,
not the new assets.

1147
01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.810
That's why activity collapses.
Okay.

1148
01:06:43.811 --> 01:06:47.260
And then another terrible thing is that what if the optimists are indispensable

1149
01:06:47.261 --> 01:06:48.760
to the economy?
Like the big banks,

1150
01:06:48.761 --> 01:06:51.400
they go out of business and then everything topples.
Well,

1151
01:06:51.401 --> 01:06:53.580
why didn't the big banks take that into account?

1152
01:06:53.590 --> 01:06:56.440
Shouldn't they have realized the losses would be so big and try to protect

1153
01:06:56.441 --> 01:07:00.400
themselves?
Well,
they're not taking into account that when they go on,

1154
01:07:00.401 --> 01:07:04.240
during the managers lose a lot of money that there are other people they don't

1155
01:07:04.241 --> 01:07:07.420
care about like all their workers and the rest of the economy that's losing even

1156
01:07:07.421 --> 01:07:09.430
more than not,
are not paying attention to,

1157
01:07:09.431 --> 01:07:13.240
so they're not internalizing all the losses when they go out of business.

1158
01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:14.620
Now another incredible,

1159
01:07:14.621 --> 01:07:18.730
the bad thing is what we're suffering from now is debt overhang.

1160
01:07:18.970 --> 01:07:22.150
There are a tremendous number of people,

1161
01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:25.480
homeowners to name one who are underwater.

1162
01:07:25.481 --> 01:07:29.050
That means they owe more money than their house worth,

1163
01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:33.790
or banks that have more debts than the value of the assets they hold.

1164
01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:36.970
Or firms that have more debt than the value of the assets they hold.
Now,

1165
01:07:36.971 --> 01:07:38.770
many of these people don't just go bankrupt.

1166
01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:41.350
They keep going because maybe they'll get lucky,
you know,

1167
01:07:41.351 --> 01:07:45.430
maybe some miracle will happen and the stuff they own is going to go up in
value.

1168
01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:50.200
So they don't stop.
They still exist,
but they're what people have called zombies.

1169
01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:54.670
They're not doing anything productive because what's the point in fixing up your

1170
01:07:54.671 --> 01:07:57.970
house if more than likely you're going to end up losing it anyway.

1171
01:07:58.090 --> 01:08:01.150
So all these homeowners are not doing anything to take care of their houses.

1172
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:03.990
The banks aren't making loans via,
you know,

1173
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.060
these firms aren't making productive investments because they know they're so

1174
01:08:07.061 --> 01:08:11.980
far underwater.
So another horrible thing happens is that,

1175
01:08:11.981 --> 01:08:15.100
you know,
if you try to collect the collateral,
when people default,

1176
01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:18.470
it's a costly operation.
So in subprime loans,

1177
01:08:18.471 --> 01:08:21.080
it takes 18 months to throw somebody out of their house.

1178
01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:24.380
So during those 18 months,
the guy's not paying his mortgage.

1179
01:08:24.381 --> 01:08:28.400
He's not paying his taxes.
All of which the,
you know,
you have to make up for,

1180
01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:32.150
he's trashing the house or if he doesn't trash it,
he leaves the house in,

1181
01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:34.790
some neighbor trashes it and rips out everything in the house.

1182
01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:39.260
The average subprime loan,
when you force someone out of their house and sell it,

1183
01:08:39.261 --> 01:08:42.620
you get back one quarter,
the value of the house.
Now,
you know,

1184
01:08:42.621 --> 01:08:45.710
at the beginning people assumed it could never be less than 80%.

1185
01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:49.400
Now it's one quarter.
Okay,
now,
um,

1186
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:53.210
okay.
And then there's other more complicated things that can go wrong,

1187
01:08:53.211 --> 01:08:55.160
which I'm going to skip over.
Okay?

1188
01:08:55.161 --> 01:08:59.480
So let's just see what happens now with housing.

1189
01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:03.680
So what is it that's happening with housing?
If you look at people underwater,

1190
01:09:03.681 --> 01:09:07.370
why are people defaulting on their houses?
It's because they're underwater.

1191
01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:12.760
So here is for every different kind of mortgage starting at subprime and going

1192
01:09:13.221 --> 01:09:16.250
down to prime.
These are except government loans.

1193
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:21.140
This is the fraction of people who default every month,
not every year.

1194
01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:24.710
And here's their loan to value.
So how did I figure out the loan to value?

1195
01:09:24.711 --> 01:09:26.480
I had to look at all the original loans.

1196
01:09:26.481 --> 01:09:30.590
I did this house by House or Ellington by Hedge Fund.
Actually,

1197
01:09:30.591 --> 01:09:35.240
the guys there who were former students,
uh,
here,
uh,
they di,

1198
01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:38.210
they actually figured all this out.
They went house by House.

1199
01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:42.260
They got with the combined loan,
the loan sizes were,
and all the houses,

1200
01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:45.710
and then using the Shiller index,
they know what the house was bought for,

1201
01:09:45.711 --> 01:09:49.820
and assuming the Zip Code Index dropped by 20% they figured every house in the

1202
01:09:49.821 --> 01:09:53.240
index went down by 20% so they can get the current value of the house.

1203
01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:56.930
So this is the ratio of the loan to the current value of the house.

1204
01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:59.900
Current combined loan to value ratio.

1205
01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:04.250
So 140 means the loans altogether,
first and second loans,

1206
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:07.370
or 140% of what they estimate the value of the houses.

1207
01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:11.930
So look at what happens if you're subprime and you've got that,
I can't see my,

1208
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:15.830
this is a 140 is over here somewhere,
right?
Um,
you're,

1209
01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:17.870
you're defaulting more than 6% a month.

1210
01:10:17.871 --> 01:10:21.830
If you're 160 you're defaulting at 8% every month.

1211
01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:24.290
8% of those people are becoming serious,

1212
01:10:24.291 --> 01:10:28.610
delinquent and probably will never repay 8% a month in one year,

1213
01:10:28.611 --> 01:10:33.050
they're all going to be gone.
Okay?
So you can see this as a shocking,
you know,

1214
01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:35.340
it's shockingly sensitive to loan devalue.

1215
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:38.270
It's not that people are defaulting cause they lost their jobs.

1216
01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:42.770
They're defaulting because it's not worth it for them to pay.
They're not stupid.

1217
01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:46.490
Why should they pay 160,000 when the house is only worth 100,000?

1218
01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:49.040
It's just how can they,
you know,
times are tough.

1219
01:10:49.041 --> 01:10:51.330
Where are they going to do tell their children?
Well,
we can't go.

1220
01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:54.350
We can't feed you.
You can't go to school because you know,

1221
01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:57.560
daddy and mommy have to pay this thing where we don't really have to pay it.

1222
01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:02.360
They're not going to do it.
So somehow I couldn't convince Larry Summers this.

1223
01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:06.800
I tried hard.
I wrote an op Ed in the New York Times in October of 2000,

1224
01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:10.050
uh,
eight I wrote another one in,
uh,

1225
01:11:10.190 --> 01:11:13.940
March seven October.
No,
a year ago.
What are we talking about?

1226
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:15.660
October of 2008,

1227
01:11:15.661 --> 01:11:20.130
the march of 2009 saying that the only way to save the housing market was to

1228
01:11:20.131 --> 01:11:22.050
write down principle.
Okay?

1229
01:11:22.051 --> 01:11:26.630
Now writing down principal means saying if the loan is 160,000 maybe the house

1230
01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:31.050
used to be 200,000 the houses only 100,000 now you just say,
okay,

1231
01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:33.300
we're writing off 80,000 of the loan.

1232
01:11:33.301 --> 01:11:36.600
It's now only $80,000 that the homeowner owes.

1233
01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:40.710
Now who's going to pay for the last 80,000 I say nobody has to pay for it.

1234
01:11:40.711 --> 01:11:44.220
The government doesn't have to pay a penny.
The bond holder,

1235
01:11:44.221 --> 01:11:48.990
the lender would be better off writing down the loan to 80,000 then throwing the

1236
01:11:48.991 --> 01:11:53.100
guy out of the house and getting 40,000 in the end because once the loan is

1237
01:11:53.101 --> 01:11:57.540
written down to 80,000 the homeowner now has 20,000 of equity in the house.

1238
01:11:57.690 --> 01:11:59.550
He'll either work hard,
you know,

1239
01:11:59.551 --> 01:12:04.320
to fix it up and spruce it up and sell it for 100,000 or he'll actually pay the

1240
01:12:04.321 --> 01:12:05.580
80,000 either way,

1241
01:12:05.581 --> 01:12:10.170
the lender's going to get 80,000 not 40,000 so this is a win win,

1242
01:12:10.171 --> 01:12:13.700
as I called it,
the editorial with Susan Cognac.
It's a winner,

1243
01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:15.660
coauthor a law professor at Bu.

1244
01:12:15.661 --> 01:12:19.440
It's a win win situation and it's not happening.
Okay.

1245
01:12:19.441 --> 01:12:23.760
And it's not happening because the loans are all in the hands of the servicers.

1246
01:12:23.761 --> 01:12:28.320
So remember I said there was this big pool with all the loans in them and then

1247
01:12:28.350 --> 01:12:30.960
you know there were the bonds and so the bond holders,

1248
01:12:30.961 --> 01:12:34.500
these are the people would like to see the principal written down,

1249
01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:38.100
but they're the bondholders don't know who the homeowners are and aren't legal

1250
01:12:38.110 --> 01:12:42.240
light to talk to them.
There's a servicer in the middle who's a big bang,

1251
01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:45.270
who's writing the letter saying pay up.
And if they pay up,

1252
01:12:45.271 --> 01:12:47.210
they distribute the money to the bond holders.

1253
01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:49.800
If they don't pay up the service with throws them out of the house.

1254
01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:52.830
The servicer or the big main doesn't own the loans.

1255
01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:57.720
They're getting paid a percentage like 0.5% of the principal.

1256
01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:02.040
So they have no incentive to write down these loans.

1257
01:13:02.130 --> 01:13:04.980
If they write down the loan in half,
they lose half their fee.

1258
01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:08.730
If they write down the loan to 80,000 then the guy sells the house.
They don't,

1259
01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:13.080
they don't service the house anymore.
They lose all their fees.
Instead Obama,

1260
01:13:13.170 --> 01:13:15.820
thanks to,
you know,
all my classmate Larry Summers and,

1261
01:13:15.821 --> 01:13:17.490
and all his other advisors,

1262
01:13:17.670 --> 01:13:21.840
they've given these servicers license not to write down any loans,
but to,

1263
01:13:21.841 --> 01:13:24.390
you know,
pretend that they're writing down the interest on the loans.

1264
01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:27.240
Now that would be great if this,
if,
and that's actually what's happening.

1265
01:13:27.241 --> 01:13:30.330
The servicers are basically not even kicking the people out of their houses.

1266
01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:32.490
So these people are not paying anything.

1267
01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:34.920
Now there are millions of them not paying anything,

1268
01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:38.730
still living in their houses in a year or two,
they're going to get thrown out.

1269
01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:41.460
Okay.
Uh,
but of course they're not going to pay.

1270
01:13:41.461 --> 01:13:45.510
This is the ideal situation for the servicer because he's still collecting his

1271
01:13:45.511 --> 01:13:48.300
fee.
The homeowners can't sell,

1272
01:13:48.330 --> 01:13:51.330
they don't want to leave because they're not paying anything and the bond

1273
01:13:51.331 --> 01:13:55.200
holders are getting screwed.
So the,
it's a,
it's a catastrophe.

1274
01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:57.300
And finally,
after a year,

1275
01:13:57.301 --> 01:14:01.830
if you read the op eds and the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal in the

1276
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:04.110
last week or two,
there've been deluged with people saying,

1277
01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:06.480
why aren't they writing down principal?
Okay.

1278
01:14:06.481 --> 01:14:10.290
So this is something that a year or two ago I already advocated anyone with any

1279
01:14:10.291 --> 01:14:13.120
common sense would have seen that was what was inevitably going to happen and we

1280
01:14:13.121 --> 01:14:16.660
didn't do anything about it.
Okay.
So I,
I got one more minute to finish.

1281
01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:20.290
So what should we do about the leverage cycle?
Well,

1282
01:14:20.291 --> 01:14:24.050
the thing to do about the leverage cycle is to,
is to um,

1283
01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:28.390
reverse the three bad things that happen in the leverage cycle.
Okay.

1284
01:14:28.391 --> 01:14:32.080
The first one was that,
you know,
there was two little,
okay.

1285
01:14:32.081 --> 01:14:34.990
The most important one is leveraged,
collapsed.
So the bank,

1286
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:39.280
the Fed has to go and increase leverage.
So it used to be,
you know,

1287
01:14:39.281 --> 01:14:43.270
30 to one or 20 to one.
Now it's close to one to one on many acids,

1288
01:14:43.271 --> 01:14:44.470
although it's gone up a little bit.

1289
01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:48.490
So the Fed has actually done something about this.
What does it have to do?

1290
01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:52.480
Not Lend it lower interest.
The Fed cut the interest rate to zero and said,

1291
01:14:52.481 --> 01:14:55.870
look how great we are.
Well that did nothing practically all it did.

1292
01:14:55.871 --> 01:14:58.900
The reason the Fed has kept the interest rate to zero is to give money to the

1293
01:14:58.901 --> 01:15:00.580
big banks because the banks have to pay.

1294
01:15:00.581 --> 01:15:04.300
Depositors like you and me now in your checking account or savings account,

1295
01:15:04.301 --> 01:15:07.240
you're getting zero practically because the Fed lowered the interest rate to

1296
01:15:07.241 --> 01:15:11.290
zero.
That means the banks make money because they don't have to waste any money

1297
01:15:11.291 --> 01:15:13.150
giving it to their depositors.
Okay?

1298
01:15:13.151 --> 01:15:16.480
That's the reason why the interest rate went down to zero and there they try to

1299
01:15:16.481 --> 01:15:19.720
dupe the public into thinking it's because it's a Keynesian stimulus.

1300
01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:21.190
It's not stimulating anything.

1301
01:15:21.191 --> 01:15:25.600
Basically what you have to do is land with less collateral and the banks aren't

1302
01:15:25.601 --> 01:15:26.291
willing to do it.

1303
01:15:26.291 --> 01:15:30.720
The Fed has to go around the banks and lend with West collateral,
which I,

1304
01:15:30.730 --> 01:15:31.780
I'm running a lot of times.

1305
01:15:31.781 --> 01:15:34.420
I can't explain how it's actually done that and that's one of the big reasons

1306
01:15:34.421 --> 01:15:37.120
leverage is starting to go up.
Secondly,

1307
01:15:37.121 --> 01:15:41.050
you have to replace some of the natural buyers,
okay?

1308
01:15:41.051 --> 01:15:44.290
Who have gone out of business,
the ones at the top who are doing all the buying.

1309
01:15:44.291 --> 01:15:46.870
Without them,
the price is going to be worth much less.

1310
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:48.850
The government is going to have to do some buying.

1311
01:15:48.851 --> 01:15:52.120
So through the p pip program and other things,
it is doing some of that.

1312
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:55.180
And then finally,
the first thing,
the most important thing,

1313
01:15:55.181 --> 01:15:57.430
the crisis began with housing.

1314
01:15:57.670 --> 01:16:02.670
Housing is the first thing you have to do to lessen the instability and the

1315
01:16:03.371 --> 01:16:04.750
uncertainty in the economy.

1316
01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:08.530
It's now started with housing and it's spread to other people who are
underwater.

1317
01:16:08.531 --> 01:16:10.270
That's where all the uncertainty comes from.

1318
01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:13.360
So we have to straighten out who's going to go out of business and who's not

1319
01:16:13.361 --> 01:16:16.930
going to go out of business.
We have to write down principle of the homes.

1320
01:16:16.931 --> 01:16:20.440
That's the way to,
to to reduce that uncertainty.
And in the long run,

1321
01:16:20.441 --> 01:16:24.160
we have to prevent the next leverage cycle by never letting leverage get so
high.

1322
01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:28.420
So we have to keep the data and we have to prevent people from asking for so

1323
01:16:28.421 --> 01:16:29.440
little margins.
