WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.190
So we were spending a couple classes these days learning basic facts and

2
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.450
vocabulary about finance.
And uh,

3
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:17.070
along the way we're trying to apply the simple lessons that Irving Fisher taught

4
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.640
about,
uh,

5
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.160
turning a financial problem into a general equilibrium problem and making use in

6
00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:25.260
particular of the budget set.
You know,

7
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:28.220
that very simple budgets that we wrote down at the very beginning.

8
00:00:28.221 --> 00:00:32.790
It turns out to be quite useful and people often can get quite confused.

9
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.660
So the last issue we ended with,
I'm going to take up again.

10
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:40.890
Suppose that you've got a very long lived institution like Yale.

11
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.060
Um,
how should Yale think of how much to spend every year?

12
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.250
What is Yale's budget set?
Well,
you know,

13
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:52.251
almost every big institution like Yale creates a fiction of an annual budget and

14
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:54.751
you know,

15
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:58.440
they talk about the deficit and having to bring the deficit under control and

16
00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:01.680
making cuts to,
you know,
close the deficit gap.

17
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.640
But really there is no such thing as a,

18
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.760
as a one year budget said.
I mean,
why one year?

19
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:11.010
Why not one month?
Why not one day?

20
00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:14.070
Nobody expects Yale to budget balance its budget every day.

21
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:15.690
Some expenditure comes in in the day.

22
00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:18.600
They have to hire an electrician to fix something unexpected.

23
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.100
They're going to spend more money than they take in,
in a student,
uh,

24
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.600
tuition that day.

25
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.530
So the fact that they're supposed to budget the balance every year is just a

26
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:32.040
fiction.
Irving Fisher taught us that Yale really has,

27
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:34.770
if you can borrow and lend and you don't have to worry about risk,

28
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.350
there's one infinite lived budget set.

29
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.010
It's an infinite horizon budget set where you just take the present value of all

30
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:43.050
the expenditures.
That's the,

31
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.860
that's the left hand side and the present value of all the revenue that's the

32
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:47.730
right hand side,

33
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:51.930
and make sure that the left hand side is smaller than the right hand side over

34
00:01:51.931 --> 00:01:53.790
the whole course of Yale's life.

35
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.180
So that simple principle has a tremendous implication,

36
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.860
which was overlooked to the Chagrin of the last deal president.
So as I said,

37
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:08.910
the issue was in 1997 I believe it could have been 96,
something like that.

38
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:13.560
1997,
uh,
Benno Schmidt,
who was then the Yale president,

39
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.660
released a white paper.
He called it documenting the fact that Yale hadn't,

40
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.280
uh,
had deferred maintenance in the buildings he called it.
And the,

41
00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:27.090
a study that he commissioned,
a very good study that he commissioned,

42
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.480
argued that the deferred maintenance Yale could be brought up to snuff and then

43
00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:38.151
go on afterwards as a normal running institution provided it spent $100 million

44
00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:42.510
a year for 10 years,
and that included fixing every college,
you know,

45
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:45.450
they're going to do more than one a year over a 10 year period.

46
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.760
So Yale's total budget,
as I told you,
it was about a billion dollars at the time.

47
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.680
And then here all of a sudden was this hundred million dollars a year expense

48
00:02:55.681 --> 00:03:00.100
for 10 years.
That's 10% of the Yale budget.
And a lot of the costs,
you know,

49
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:02.380
you can't change.
I mean,
you have to have the lights on,

50
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:05.470
you have to heat the buildings.
You can't really reduce those costs.

51
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.420
So Benno Schmidt came to the conclusion that he have to reduce the costs.

52
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:14.800
He could change by 15% in order to balance the budget to cut,
you know,

53
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:17.710
about a hundred million dollars a year out of the budget.

54
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.920
So he announced one day that he's going to fire 15% of the faculty by attrition

55
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.210
you don't,
if they were junior faculty wouldn't promote them.

56
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.750
And if they were senior faculty,
wait till they retired and not replace them.

57
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.850
So this needless to say,
caused a tremendous commotion of knowing the Faculty.

58
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:37.780
And as I told you,
a committee was formed and,
and I had to present the report.

59
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.520
So actually the report when pretty carefully through all the calculations made

60
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:43.780
in the white paper,

61
00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:48.781
but the heart of the report was simply to reel to apply the lesson of Irving

62
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.190
Fisher.
So what is the lesson of Irving Fisher?

63
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:55.810
Let's suppose that there's no inflation so that when they say $100 million a

64
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:58.390
year,
they mean a hundred million real dollars a year.

65
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.870
So Irving Fisher would say Yale's going to live forever.

66
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.580
Let's suppose that we want that.

67
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:07.300
Yale wants the same quality of education every year forever.

68
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.930
So should have the same wheel spending every year forever after,

69
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.290
after it compensates for inflation.

70
00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:17.890
So at the moment we're assuming there's no inflation.
So what does that mean?

71
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.390
That means that you just look at the right hand side and you say what's Yale's

72
00:04:22.391 --> 00:04:25.120
revenue?
Well,
whatever it was before we've,

73
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.690
we were told by this report to the president that as long as you did the

74
00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:31.390
deferred maintenance,
yeah.
Would be back in balance.

75
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.450
So what's the loss of revenue on the right hand side?

76
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.100
It's 10 years of $100 million a year.
As you can see now you need a,
uh,

77
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:43.000
an interest rate.
What should the interest rate be?
Well,
uh,

78
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.850
should it be the nominal interest rate of the real interest rate?

79
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:47.950
What we're supposing now there's no inflation.

80
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.850
So it should be the real interest rate because all the hundreds are,
are,

81
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.260
you know,
have no inflation in them.
So what real interest rate should we use?

82
00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:57.094
Well,
the,

83
00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.710
<v 1>yeah,</v>

84
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.710
<v 0>the white paper used 5% because they thought that was the number that Yale</v>

85
00:05:03.991 --> 00:05:05.670
could,
could,
uh,

86
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.060
earn after inflation pretty reliably.
Every year they call it.

87
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.150
They think that's the,
the real rate of return Yale gets.

88
00:05:15.151 --> 00:05:17.100
And so they discounted at 5%.

89
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.110
Now the real rate of interest typically in the economy is 3% but let's suppose

90
00:05:22.111 --> 00:05:24.060
that we calculated this at 5%.

91
00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:29.061
The present value of a a hundred for 10 years is 772.

92
00:05:29.581 --> 00:05:32.160
Now,
how could you do that in your head?
Well,

93
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.830
we know that,
you know,

94
00:05:36.831 --> 00:05:41.280
5% is going to double every,
um,

95
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.300
5% is going to double every,

96
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.323
<v 1>uh,</v>

97
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.130
<v 0>14 years,
you know,
five and the 72 is about 14.</v>

98
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.730
So in 10 years,
you're going to get,

99
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.860
if a doubles every 14 years,

100
00:05:56.861 --> 00:06:00.590
10 years is going to be less than half the value of the bond.

101
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.270
So if you've got a hundred forever,
at 5% interest,
that would be 2 billion.

102
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.560
And we know for only 10 years,
it's less than half the value.
So you know,

103
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:12.050
considerably less than half the value.
So it's not 1 billion.

104
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:14.300
It's something less than that at 772.

105
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:18.110
So I just did that in excel and I calculated seven 72.
But in your head,

106
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:22.730
you know that if it had gone on for 14 years,
then the present value,

107
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:27.731
our formula or famous formula is that you would take the coupon,

108
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.760
a hundred divided by the interest rate 0.05 times one minus one plus r to the

109
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:38.120
10th.
And so we know that if,

110
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.240
if this were 14 instead of 10 you'd get a half here.

111
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.320
So this is 20 times 100 which is 2 billion times a half would be 1 billion.

112
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.920
But since it's only 10 years and not 14 years,
it's less than a billion.
So okay,

113
00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:51.950
772 so when you're ahead,
you could have probably figured that out.

114
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.710
So the loss in pres approximately.

115
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.850
So you can be sitting there in the audience hearing Benno Schmidt talk and be

116
00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:02.180
computing in your head that we're talking about something under a billion,

117
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:03.950
like you know,
three quarters of a billion.

118
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.850
So now how much does that mean reduction in every year?
Well,

119
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:10.670
if he yells going to spend the same amount every year,

120
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:15.910
that means it should be spending 5% of 772 less every year.

121
00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:20.510
That's 38 point $6 million less every year.

122
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.800
So that's a drastically smaller number than a hundred million dollars a year.

123
00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:29.180
It's crazy just to think that because you've got these expenditures for 10 years

124
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.190
and the no expenditures after that,

125
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.720
that you should cut the budget by 100 million and then let it go up after 10

126
00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:37.760
years.
So,
um,

127
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.840
you'd only need to cut it by 38 million.
Now,
by the way,

128
00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:46.580
5% is a pretty arbitrary number.
Suppose you put 3% here,
well,

129
00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:49.940
3% would give you a much higher present value,

130
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:54.200
but then when you multiplied by 3% at the end for the,
for the annual reduction,

131
00:07:54.201 --> 00:07:58.010
it would give you a much smaller number.
So that anyway,
this number,

132
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.420
uh,
which I computed an XL,
but again,

133
00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:05.540
you can do it sort of in your head is 853 million,

134
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:11.140
but you multiply that by 3% and you get 25 or 26 million a year.

135
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.850
So now the reduction is starting to sound like it's not such a,

136
00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:20.600
a frightening thing.
So let's stick with the,

137
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.690
let's stick with the 5% which is what the white paper,

138
00:08:23.691 --> 00:08:26.570
take all of the assumptions of the white paper and take it literally,

139
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.340
and then notice that they never said anything about inflation.
So actually this,

140
00:08:31.341 --> 00:08:35.930
uh,
this calculation of present value loss is,
is,
uh,

141
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:40.520
it's right,
it's,
it's,
um,
there's inflation and save.

142
00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:43.430
The inflation at that time was around 4%.
In fact,

143
00:08:43.431 --> 00:08:47.060
all the Gail contracts that are still in place assume a 4% inflation,

144
00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:49.100
even though inflation is less than that now.
But anyway,

145
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:53.960
so that 100 million a year of dollars is actually less in present value terms.

146
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.460
Because what should discount by,

147
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.670
if you look at the present value of $100 million over 10 years,

148
00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:01.140
and you take into account installers,

149
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.010
you should be discounting by the real interest rate times the inflation.
Okay?

150
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:08.970
So by 9%,
a little,
a overnight,
tiny bit over 9%.

151
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.700
So if you discount that by 9%,

152
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.880
you get a 641 billion as the present value.

153
00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:22.200
1 million as the present value loss to Yale.
Okay?
Now,

154
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:27.120
given that there's inflation,
how much should you be spending every year?

155
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:32.720
Okay,
you should be spending in real dollars reducing your spend.

156
00:09:32.721 --> 00:09:35.520
A sure how much in real dollars?
Well,
by five not oh wait,

157
00:09:35.521 --> 00:09:39.150
9% by 5% of the 641 million.

158
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:44.070
So if you have 641 that's today's present value in,
you know,

159
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.420
there hasn't been any inflation yet.
So that's the real loss in dollars.

160
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:52.860
So if you ask what's the real expenditure reduction every year,

161
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:57.950
it's 5% of 641 and that's 32 million.

162
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:00.451
Okay.

163
00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:05.451
So 32 million is a far smaller number than 100 million and requires a small,

164
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:11.160
far smaller drop in Expat in you know,
expenses.

165
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:16.280
So our committee recommended that we cut the faculty by 6% instead of by 15% and

166
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.960
6% there are a lot of people leaving every year.
You can do 6% pretty quickly.

167
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.650
So the upshot of this is that it's a simple application of present value,

168
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.690
very elementary calculation.

169
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:32.550
It came as somewhat of a revelation to our administrators,
I'm afraid.

170
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.610
And,
uh,
the day after the report,

171
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.450
the provost of the university resigned.
Two weeks later,

172
00:10:39.451 --> 00:10:42.930
the dean of the university resigned and two months later,

173
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.710
the president of the university resigned and Rick Levin,

174
00:10:46.711 --> 00:10:50.250
the current president took over and he,
um,

175
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:56.440
cut the faculty by 6%,
but by no more than that.
And then of course,
the,

176
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:57.640
the finances of yeah,

177
00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.830
got much better and he's since added back that 6% plus a little bit more than

178
00:11:01.831 --> 00:11:06.000
that.
So just to tell you though,
something good about the Yale administration,

179
00:11:06.001 --> 00:11:10.380
the provost who resigned that next day happens to be a friend of mine.

180
00:11:10.381 --> 00:11:14.250
I've had dinner with him every month for the last,
you know,

181
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.020
12 years since this happened.

182
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:21.260
And he's never once criticized me or showing the slightest discomfort about the

183
00:11:22.201 --> 00:11:27.060
report that basically ended his,
uh,
his,
you know,

184
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.860
his administrative career.

185
00:11:28.861 --> 00:11:33.660
He cares so much about Yale and is so d was so determined to do the right thing.

186
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.990
He just thought he made a miscalculation and stepped aside.
So he,
he,

187
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
so I believe that he wanted to do the right thing for Yale and just made the

188
00:11:44.341 --> 00:11:45.300
wrong calculation.

189
00:11:45.301 --> 00:11:49.050
Not that he had some political agenda or something to cut such a huge part of

190
00:11:49.051 --> 00:11:53.400
the faculty.
So it's the most honest and the most,
uh,
um,

191
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.850
Yale loving,
uh,
administrator that,
um,

192
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.330
you could imagine.
And,
um,

193
00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.670
I didn't know what the reaction would be if someone like him after giving the

194
00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:06.250
report.
I was quite terrified actually,
that they'd be,

195
00:12:06.251 --> 00:12:08.470
they were still the president and the provost and the dean,

196
00:12:08.471 --> 00:12:13.120
that they would be quite angry at our committee.
Um,
but they responded,

197
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.630
um,
with tremendous integrity.
Yes.

198
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:27.400
Okay.
You tell me why did I do that?
So why,

199
00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:32.310
so someone else tell me.
So that's a good question.
Why is that?
Yes.

200
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:37.870
<v 2>Finding that Cubana the perpetuity that with a 5% interest,</v>

201
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:43.870
it's like you're,
you're rearranging.
See over articles,
present value,

202
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:45.903
present value times,

203
00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:52.450
<v 0>right?
So the question was why?
After I figured out the present value loss,</v>

204
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.710
I like a 772 million.

205
00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:59.720
Why did I multiply that by 5% to figure out how much Yale should reduce it

206
00:12:59.721 --> 00:13:01.250
spending every year?

207
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:05.850
And the answer that was given down here is that I'm assuming that Yale was going

208
00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:10.820
to go on forever.
So Yale can reduce his expenditures every year forever.

209
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:15.200
And by doing that and make up for the same present value loss,
so,
uh,

210
00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.290
forever means perpetually.
So it's a perpetuity.

211
00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:23.270
So how much do you have to reduce,
what is the coupon reduction,

212
00:13:23.271 --> 00:13:27.410
the expenditure reduction every year at 5% interest,

213
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:32.090
that just makes a present value decline of 772 million?
Well,

214
00:13:32.091 --> 00:13:36.230
it's 5% of the principal.
If you have 772 million in the bank,

215
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.190
and every year 5% of that you throw away,

216
00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.330
you've thrown away the whole value.
Oh,

217
00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.740
at 5% interest of the 772 million.

218
00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:50.000
So by reducing our expenditures by 5% every year you,

219
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.920
you defray the $772 million loss.
So that's the credit.

220
00:13:54.921 --> 00:13:56.150
So the critical thing,

221
00:13:56.151 --> 00:14:00.830
the critical mistake that the administration made is they had a short run

222
00:14:00.831 --> 00:14:03.710
problem with a bunch of short run costs,

223
00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:06.200
but Yale is going to live forever and Yale should,

224
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.510
should share the cost and the loss overall future,
uh,

225
00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.630
generations not just make the current faculty and the current students and the

226
00:14:14.631 --> 00:14:18.590
current,
you know,
city bear,
all the costs of,
of,
uh,

227
00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:23.030
of this one shot a loss,
the,
you know,
one shot problem that Yale faced.

228
00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:28.510
So they weren't thinking in fishers terms of taking the present value over the

229
00:14:29.091 --> 00:14:32.540
whole course of the lifetime of the institution.
They were thinking,
well,

230
00:14:32.541 --> 00:14:36.740
we've got to spend $100 million this year.
We better cut costs by $100 million.

231
00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:40.220
But you,
but that's obviously crazy.
Like suppose you had to spend an extra,

232
00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:44.600
you know,
$100,000 in one day,
uh,
does that mean you should,
you know,

233
00:14:44.601 --> 00:14:49.220
lay off your faculty for one days?
You can find the money to,
to pay that.

234
00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:50.054
And of course not.

235
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:55.070
So you have to you to spread the loss over the lifetime of the university.
Okay.

236
00:14:55.071 --> 00:14:58.340
So there are any other questions about this principle?
Yes,

237
00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.910
<v 2>77 million.</v>

238
00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:15.520
<v 0>If I want it to incur the whole cost over over 10 years,</v>

239
00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:20.820
then I would have to reduce my expenditures by $100 million a year for if,

240
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.640
if at the end of 10 years I wanted to be back.

241
00:15:24.641 --> 00:15:28.840
Even then I would have to spend less,

242
00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.830
I would have to cut my expenditures by exactly the money I was pouring into the

243
00:15:32.831 --> 00:15:35.070
buildings.
So if I wanted to,
you know,

244
00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.800
reduce my expenditures by an equal amount every year,

245
00:15:37.801 --> 00:15:42.700
I'd have to be $100 million for 10 years.
Right.
If the horizons or if the,

246
00:15:42.701 --> 00:15:46.030
if the the maintenance costs go over a pen,

247
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:50.560
10 year period and I want the expenditures to go over a 10 year period.

248
00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:52.180
<v 2>Okay.</v>

249
00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.013
<v 0>Right.</v>

250
00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.880
So if I want the expenditures to reduced evenly over 10 year period,

251
00:15:57.881 --> 00:16:01.990
I'd have to do $100 million a year if I wanted to eat away the cost all in one

252
00:16:01.991 --> 00:16:03.490
year.
I guess I didn't understand your question.

253
00:16:03.491 --> 00:16:07.450
You're saying if I wanted to reduce expenditures entirely in one year and then

254
00:16:07.451 --> 00:16:11.200
return next year to my usual pattern of expenditure,

255
00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:16.000
then I'd have to cut the $1 billion budget by 772 million.

256
00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:20.740
So that would involve basically firing the whole faculty and saying,

257
00:16:20.741 --> 00:16:24.220
take a year off.
You're on furlough,
sort of what they're doing in California.

258
00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:25.840
So yes.

259
00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:35.583
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

260
00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:36.990
<v 0>I could do that.
If I wanted,</v>

261
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.300
I could rearrange the hundred million anywhere I want any way I want it to.

262
00:16:40.301 --> 00:16:44.410
So you would cut less than a hundred million dollars this year out of the budget

263
00:16:44.411 --> 00:16:46.720
and a little bit more every year after that.

264
00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:52.070
Well,

265
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:56.990
one way to do the costs over within a 10 year timeframe is reduce costs,

266
00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:01.310
reduce,
you know,
paying the faculty by $100 million every year for 10 years.

267
00:17:01.311 --> 00:17:04.460
Right.
That would obviously do it because that's the money I need to get.

268
00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:08.330
You could rearrange that by reducing costs a little less at the beginning and a

269
00:17:08.331 --> 00:17:10.040
little more at the end of the 10 years.

270
00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.400
But I would say that doesn't sound no one,
you know,

271
00:17:13.401 --> 00:17:17.630
why do that then that makes the,
you know,
that's kind of what bad politicians do.

272
00:17:17.631 --> 00:17:20.630
They say,
well we're not gonna,
you know,
it's not our fault.

273
00:17:20.631 --> 00:17:24.860
We'll just make those guys and year 10 get totally crushed and sooner,

274
00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.340
pretty soon they are in year 10 and then they've got,
you know,
200 million,

275
00:17:28.341 --> 00:17:29.690
they have to cut costs and that,

276
00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:35.010
<v 2>yes.
So
do another round.</v>

277
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:45.190
<v 0>Right.
Okay.
So there's a good question.
So there,
there,</v>

278
00:17:45.191 --> 00:17:47.650
there was actually some people that,
you know,

279
00:17:47.651 --> 00:17:50.580
the administrator that was their best response,
they said,

280
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:55.260
well even though the white paper said this was a one shot thing and after we can

281
00:17:55.261 --> 00:17:59.670
do this 10 year prank plan,
Yale is back in good shape.

282
00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:04.050
And of course every year or Gail has allowed,
you know,
maintenance expenses.

283
00:18:04.051 --> 00:18:05.490
That's part of the budget is maintenance.

284
00:18:05.491 --> 00:18:09.510
And so after we get the buildings back and ship,
you know,
tip top shape,

285
00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:13.120
we're going to keep them in tip top shape by doing these,
uh,
you know,

286
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.670
normal expenditures every year.

287
00:18:14.671 --> 00:18:17.820
So we should never have another period where you have to do something drastic

288
00:18:17.821 --> 00:18:21.930
like that.
That's what the white paper said.
But after the report,

289
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.570
they responded just like you said.
They said,
well,

290
00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:28.860
we didn't really mean that maybe in 25 years we're going to have to do another

291
00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:33.720
remodeling a effort.
And so well,
if you need it to do that,
then,

292
00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:37.290
uh,
it wasn't just,
you know,
a onetime deferred maintenance,

293
00:18:37.291 --> 00:18:38.580
it means that you've grasped,

294
00:18:38.581 --> 00:18:43.170
drastically underestimated the costs of keeping up the buildings over,
you know,

295
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:47.040
over the els whole future.
And then you would have to then it wouldn't be,

296
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.150
so then you would have these reductions and expenditures for the first 10 years,

297
00:18:51.151 --> 00:18:55.230
and then,
you know,
when you're 35,
you'd have to have more reductions.

298
00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.170
And then in year 70 you'd have more reductions like that.

299
00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.860
So you have to take the present value of all of those things and then figure out

300
00:19:01.861 --> 00:19:04.980
how much to reduce expenditures on an even basis.

301
00:19:04.981 --> 00:19:08.010
And so it would be much more than 32 million that would,
you know,

302
00:19:08.011 --> 00:19:12.420
be 60 or something million or 50 million.
So you're exactly right,

303
00:19:12.421 --> 00:19:14.290
but that's not what they said.
And the white paper,
you know,

304
00:19:14.291 --> 00:19:17.760
so I took them literally what they meant.
And,
um,

305
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.320
so what happened after that?
You know,

306
00:19:21.321 --> 00:19:24.200
Yale has done much more building expenditures than that,

307
00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:27.230
but that's because Yale's endowment went up to 23 billion.

308
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.950
You also from 3 billion,
which it was at the time,
it's now 23 billion.

309
00:19:30.951 --> 00:19:35.090
So Gail's launched an incredible program of building construction.
Basically,

310
00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:37.520
they've done two things.
They've hired a huge number of,
uh,

311
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:41.750
built a huge number of construction jobs and they've hired a lot,

312
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.580
a lot of administrators and stuff.

313
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:48.140
So what the faculty is still not that much bigger,
you know,

314
00:19:48.141 --> 00:19:52.430
went down 6%.
It's now back a little bigger than it was before.
So,
you know,

315
00:19:52.431 --> 00:19:56.210
the plan to expand the college and expand the faculty hasn't happened yet.

316
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:59.510
So Yale faces another choice now,
you know,

317
00:19:59.511 --> 00:20:01.850
the endowment went to 23 billion,

318
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:07.040
and then this past year are they managed to lose down to 17 billion,
you know,

319
00:20:07.041 --> 00:20:11.390
30% got Wass and we're down to 17 billion now.
So again,

320
00:20:11.391 --> 00:20:16.130
we have the same question.
We just lost $6 billion.
How much should we reduce,

321
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.290
uh,
expenditures every year?

322
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:22.360
So what's your answer to that?

323
00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:32.080
Not 30%.
What a,
yeah.

324
00:20:32.081 --> 00:20:36.450
So how much would you do some expenditures?
Well,

325
00:20:36.451 --> 00:20:39.960
why wouldn't it be 30%?
Because Yale spends a lot of money.

326
00:20:39.961 --> 00:20:43.890
It doesn't get from the endowment,
right?
It gets money from tuition for example.

327
00:20:43.891 --> 00:20:48.160
So yeah.
Okay.
So how much would you,
yeah,
so what should yell do?

328
00:20:48.161 --> 00:20:50.380
What do you think he is going to have to take out of the budget now?

329
00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.430
Yeah.
And let's say it's still 5% real in truth,
then what would you do?

330
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.580
<v 2>Yeah,
you're fine.
Yeah.</v>

331
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.233
<v 0>So what's that</v>

332
00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:12.810
<v 2>606</v>

333
00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:15.570
<v 0>times 0.05.
So what's that?</v>

334
00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:21.650
Hard to do these things in your head.
Right?
But what is it?
Okay,

335
00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.760
300 million.

336
00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:27.200
So Yale's got to somehow cut 300 million out of its budget.

337
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.590
And um,
so it's not going to do it in one year,

338
00:21:30.591 --> 00:21:33.890
but over the course of the next few years it's going to have to cut 300 million.

339
00:21:33.891 --> 00:21:36.800
Now the budget is well over 2 billion.

340
00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:40.700
So that's 15% of the budget though.
Yells going to have to cut.

341
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:44.330
So this is a serious thing.
How do you cut 15% of the Yale budget?

342
00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:45.683
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

343
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:48.790
<v 0>What firing faculty?
Well,
I hope they don't do,</v>

344
00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.550
I think they learned their lesson and so I doubt if they'll do that.

345
00:21:51.551 --> 00:21:54.520
But there it's uh,
you know,

346
00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.690
things were already changing their charging for long distance telephone calls

347
00:21:58.691 --> 00:22:00.220
and you know,
all kinds of stuff like that,

348
00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:03.910
but it doesn't get you quite 300 million,

349
00:22:03.911 --> 00:22:06.130
but there's going to be a bunch of stuff like that.
So anyway,

350
00:22:06.131 --> 00:22:07.750
we have another budget problem by the way.

351
00:22:07.751 --> 00:22:10.810
So these kinds of budget problems are happening all over the country.

352
00:22:10.811 --> 00:22:13.970
I gave a talk at Albany University and they're going to,

353
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:18.700
they're going to abolish their graduate economics program.
Um,
Suny Albany,
that's,

354
00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:20.320
you know,
so they're doing all,
you know,

355
00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:24.140
these are serious problems losing that much money.
But in any case,

356
00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:26.500
6 billion translates to,
right.

357
00:22:26.501 --> 00:22:31.501
The difference here is 6 billion and you multiply that by 0.05 just as we said,

358
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.100
and that equals 300 million a year.
So yeah,
won't do it right away.

359
00:22:36.101 --> 00:22:38.410
But over the course of,
you know,
a few years,

360
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:42.070
the ales going to have to reduce its budget by 300 million.

361
00:22:42.071 --> 00:22:46.060
So they're going to obviously choose to do a lot less building and sell Volvo's

362
00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:49.420
those.
Presumably some of the new people that get hot got hired,

363
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:54.360
they're going to not keep.
So,
okay.
Any other questions?
Yup.

364
00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.053
<v 2>Yes.</v>

365
00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:07.150
Excellent assumption.

366
00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:13.780
<v 0>Right.
Okay.
Very good question.
So in the front he's saying,
you know,</v>

367
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:18.160
this presumes that we know for sure that the endowment lost 6 billion,

368
00:23:18.161 --> 00:23:20.080
it will never recover it.
Um,

369
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:24.610
maybe that's a temporary drop in the stock market and I'll go back up and

370
00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.160
basically the principal,
he's applying as he's saying,

371
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.390
you can't make these drastic reductions in the annual expenditures,
you know,

372
00:23:31.391 --> 00:23:32.590
firing people.

373
00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.740
And then two years later realizing you've got a lot of money trying to hire them

374
00:23:35.741 --> 00:23:37.480
back cause you won't be able to hire them back.

375
00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:41.710
So clearly Yale has to have a more complicated rule about how it gradually

376
00:23:41.711 --> 00:23:45.040
adjust its spending when there's a change in the endowment.

377
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:48.170
And so we're going to talk about that later cause it involves uncertainty and

378
00:23:48.171 --> 00:23:51.290
how to think about uncertainty.
But you're absolutely right.
The Yale,

379
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.520
Yale will not.

380
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.900
So Levan did not announce a $300 million reduction immediately,

381
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:59.240
but he's announced a big reduction immediately and you know,

382
00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.960
you can expect next year if the stock market doesn't drastically improve for

383
00:24:02.961 --> 00:24:06.020
there to be another reduction.
And by the way,

384
00:24:06.021 --> 00:24:08.330
you know this number could go down as well as it goes up.

385
00:24:08.331 --> 00:24:12.050
So we're going to come back to Yale's investments and you know what they're like

386
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.470
a lot of Gayle's investments are called private equity investments that are very

387
00:24:15.471 --> 00:24:19.700
hard to value.
So for all we know all this 17 is a lot worse than that.

388
00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:23.600
Um,
but we'll be finding out,
uh,
in the next year or two.

389
00:24:23.601 --> 00:24:26.810
It's not like a hedge fund where you have to,
you know,

390
00:24:26.811 --> 00:24:30.650
value all your assets by what the market will be willing to pay a lot of these

391
00:24:30.651 --> 00:24:34.760
assets there.
There is no market,
so they just sort of make up with the number is.

392
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.370
So we have to wait and we're going to come back and discuss this.

393
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:41.760
It's a very interesting question.
Okay.
All right.

394
00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:46.040
So one last thing about this present value calculations.
One last obvious thing.

395
00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:50.540
It's hard to keep in your mind the difference between real and nominal.

396
00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:52.230
<v 2>Okay?</v>

397
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:54.750
<v 0>Okay,
so let's just do a very simple thing.</v>

398
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.330
The mortgage mortgages

399
00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:01.730
are traditionally nominal pain,

400
00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:06.010
traditionally nominal fixed payments,

401
00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.870
so you might pay,
okay?
So for example,

402
00:25:12.871 --> 00:25:14.370
$100,000,

403
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:19.600
$100,000 30 year mortgage at 2.3% is about $4,600 per year.

404
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:31.450
How did I do that so quickly in my head?
Well,

405
00:25:31.451 --> 00:25:36.370
because I know if the interest rate is 2.3% and you're going to pay it forever,

406
00:25:36.371 --> 00:25:38.470
you'd pay 2,300 a year.

407
00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:43.740
We know at 30 years at 2.3% 2.3% doubles almost in 30 years.

408
00:25:44.681 --> 00:25:49.120
That's 69 that's getting pretty close to 72 so maybe it takes 31 years or

409
00:25:49.121 --> 00:25:51.700
something to double.
So after 30 years,

410
00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:56.080
the remaining part of the mortgage is only,
you know,
the remainder,

411
00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.180
the remainder is worth half the mortgage.

412
00:25:58.181 --> 00:26:01.390
So you've lost half of the value by only getting it for 30 years.

413
00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:05.500
So instead of paying 2,300 you have to pay 4,600 you know,

414
00:26:05.501 --> 00:26:10.501
so the coupon over 0.023 times one minus 1.0 to three to the 30th okay,

415
00:26:14.081 --> 00:26:17.970
that's,
that's one minus a half about,
so it's self,

416
00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.140
this coupon equals 100,000

417
00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:26.200
the payment is going to be,
since this is a half,
the payment isn't going to be,

418
00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:30.640
you know,
2,300 has to be twice that 4,600 okay.

419
00:26:30.641 --> 00:26:34.000
So it's 4,600 per year.
So if there's no inflation,

420
00:26:34.001 --> 00:26:36.430
that means you're making the same wheel payment every year.

421
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.570
Now what happens if there's inflation?
What if inflation goes up?

422
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:45.330
What if inflation goes up

423
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.140
and now what's going to happen to what you have to pay?

424
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:54.540
Well this is just,
okay,

425
00:26:54.541 --> 00:26:55.680
how would you figure that out?

426
00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:04.060
Well,
if inflation is you know,
another 2.3% or something,

427
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:09.310
then he would pay then the nominal interest rate one plus cy is going to equal

428
00:27:09.311 --> 00:27:13.600
the real interest rate times the nominal interest rate times the rate of

429
00:27:13.601 --> 00:27:15.220
inflation.
Okay,

430
00:27:15.221 --> 00:27:20.221
so let's say this is 1.023 and this is also 1.0 to three so that's 1.04 little

431
00:27:22.691 --> 00:27:24.830
bit more than four six almost,
you know,

432
00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:28.030
a little bit more than four six so you know that the interest rate,

433
00:27:28.031 --> 00:27:33.031
the mortgage companies are now going to charge is going to be a 1.046 s so the

434
00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:39.100
4.6 it's going to be the,
the the mortgage interest rate.

435
00:27:39.101 --> 00:27:42.070
And so you can figure out by the same calculation

436
00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:45.883
<v 3>what,</v>

437
00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:49.540
<v 0>what the coupon is going to be.
So what's the coupon going to be?</v>

438
00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:52.090
<v 3>Okay,</v>

439
00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:54.220
<v 0>well if you're,
you know,</v>

440
00:27:54.221 --> 00:27:58.780
instead of doubling every 30 years at 4.6% it's going to double approximately

441
00:27:58.781 --> 00:28:03.340
every 15 years.
So this is going to be doubling twice.

442
00:28:03.341 --> 00:28:08.080
This is a quarter.
So this will be three quarters here.
And so if you multiply,

443
00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:11.860
you know,
everything,
2,300 a year and times.

444
00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:13.383
<v 3>MMM.</v>

445
00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:21.480
<v 0>2,300 a year times four thirds.</v>

446
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.273
<v 3>Okay.</v>

447
00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.940
<v 0>Right.
Doing the right calculation here,
I'm telling you,</v>

448
00:28:31.941 --> 00:28:34.580
so it's so easy to compute in your head.
I mean,
well and

449
00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:45.230
Oh,
I forgot to change this to 46 so the interest rate is four six.
Okay.

450
00:28:45.231 --> 00:28:47.260
So you multiply fourth that,
so if you multiply,

451
00:28:47.261 --> 00:28:52.040
so of this to the other side is 4,600 times four thirds.

452
00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.270
Okay.
And that's,
you know,
6,000 about.
Okay.

453
00:28:56.271 --> 00:29:01.271
So that the annual payment is going to go up to 6,000 instead of 4,600 was 4,600

454
00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:07.280
the interest rate went up because there was inflation.

455
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:12.140
So of course they're going to ask you for more money every year because if you

456
00:29:12.141 --> 00:29:16.190
paid the same amount every year,
and this is the real payment.

457
00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:18.620
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

458
00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:23.060
<v 0>okay.
If you make the same amount,
and this is tying in terms of inflation,</v>

459
00:29:23.061 --> 00:29:25.490
correct.
The dollars you're paying less and less every year.

460
00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:29.930
So clearly if you started with no inflation at a number like this,

461
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:31.070
no inflation,

462
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:33.310
<v 3>okay,</v>

463
00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:36.580
<v 0>okay,
so no inflation and now you've got inflation,</v>

464
00:29:36.581 --> 00:29:40.390
but the same real interest rate and the present value of your expenditures,

465
00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:43.960
the present value,
right?
The mortgage company's going to want,

466
00:29:43.961 --> 00:29:47.440
the lender's going to want to get the same amount back in real terms as it got

467
00:29:47.441 --> 00:29:51.420
before because the inflation hasn't changed the real world.

468
00:29:51.421 --> 00:29:55.000
So Irving Fisher would save the inflation is just a veil.

469
00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:57.460
Everybody's going to want the same real interest rate.

470
00:29:57.461 --> 00:30:01.060
And so the mortgage is going to have to return the same real thing it did
before.

471
00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.450
The present value in real terms of the real payments is still going to be

472
00:30:04.451 --> 00:30:09.451
100,000 so if the real payments go down over time and have the same present

473
00:30:10.031 --> 00:30:11.320
value they had before,

474
00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:14.050
it's gotta be that they're higher at the beginning and in real terms,

475
00:30:14.051 --> 00:30:15.610
lower at the end.
So sure enough,

476
00:30:15.611 --> 00:30:20.611
6,000 is a much higher number at the beginning than 4,600 so of course when

477
00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.990
inflation went up and everybody knows it's up,

478
00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.740
that mortgage companies are going to ask for a higher annual payments.

479
00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:33.460
So it'll be 6,000 a year instead of 4,600 a year.

480
00:30:33.461 --> 00:30:38.380
But now if you inflation correct that the 6,000 every year is going to be a
less,

481
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:41.260
you don't in terms of real goods,
less and less every year.

482
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.130
But the present discounted value of this thing has to be the same as where you

483
00:30:45.131 --> 00:30:47.950
started.
So the effect is the young,

484
00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:51.940
the young borrowers are going to be spending a lot more and real goods when

485
00:30:51.941 --> 00:30:54.070
they're young and a lot less when they're old.

486
00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:58.780
So inflation has an unfortunate impact on mortgages,

487
00:30:58.781 --> 00:31:03.190
quoted a nominal dollars that it makes the repayments happen earlier.

488
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.850
So the young who have less money or having to pay a huge amount and when they

489
00:31:06.851 --> 00:31:07.630
get old,

490
00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:11.710
you know the inflation so high that that same $6,000 is practically nothing.

491
00:31:11.711 --> 00:31:15.340
So when they're 50 and 60 they're paying practically the peanuts to them.

492
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.380
But when they were young,
it was really a hardship.

493
00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.650
So there's a big problem with nominal mortgages,

494
00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:24.700
which is that in inflationary times it kills the housing market.
Fortunately,

495
00:31:24.701 --> 00:31:27.640
we're not in an inflationary times.
Okay?

496
00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:32.410
Any questions about that?
All right.

497
00:31:32.411 --> 00:31:36.310
So that's the basic lesson of taking the present value.
And again,

498
00:31:36.311 --> 00:31:40.420
you've always got to sort out the nominal from the real and look through the

499
00:31:40.421 --> 00:31:44.170
veil and don't get all mixed up by the fact that there's inflation.

500
00:31:44.171 --> 00:31:48.090
It's the real thing that you want to concentrate on as much as you can.
Alright,

501
00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.460
so,
alright,
so that's it for the obvious lesson of present value.

502
00:31:51.461 --> 00:31:55.330
Now I want to introduce another word,
which is very famous and finance.

503
00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.000
It's called the yield or yield to maturity.

504
00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:01.390
And I want to do it unlike the way I've presented in the notes,

505
00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:06.490
I want to do it in terms of a hedge fund.
Okay?
So if you can see this,

506
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.800
okay,

507
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:13.800
so yield the next topic or yield to maturity is a way of trying to compute one

508
00:32:17.951 --> 00:32:22.951
number that summarizes how good a bond is or how good,

509
00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:24.910
how well on hedge fund has done.

510
00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:30.510
So I think the more interesting case and the less obvious one is to start with a

511
00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:32.650
hedge fund.
Okay.

512
00:32:32.651 --> 00:32:36.790
So now how do you measure how well a hedge funds doing or how well it's done in

513
00:32:36.791 --> 00:32:39.260
the past?
Nevermind.
Yeah,
how well it's done in the past.

514
00:32:39.261 --> 00:32:42.650
We're going to spend a lot of the course talking about this in various ways with

515
00:32:42.651 --> 00:32:46.730
the first way to do it involves yield to maturity.

516
00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:51.080
So let's see why the problem is a little complicated.

517
00:32:51.081 --> 00:32:55.100
So I imagine that they're three investors in this hedge fund.
Okay.

518
00:32:55.101 --> 00:32:59.870
So every year some of the investors are going to decide what to do and they're

519
00:32:59.871 --> 00:33:04.070
going to decide whether to withdraw money yearns and faster one,

520
00:33:04.071 --> 00:33:06.890
maybe he's going to withdraw money.
The hedge funds just beginning,

521
00:33:06.891 --> 00:33:11.780
he's going to put in $100 the other two guys haven't done anything.
Okay.

522
00:33:11.781 --> 00:33:16.650
So now the hedge fund,
before this guy put in his money,

523
00:33:16.651 --> 00:33:20.690
he had nothing.
It's just beginning.
He's put in his hundred dollars.

524
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:24.860
So they hedge funds got $100 okay,
so that's it.
So I'm imagining,
you know,

525
00:33:24.861 --> 00:33:29.120
these all happen,
they usually happen quarterly or annually or something.

526
00:33:29.121 --> 00:33:30.230
They don't happen every day.

527
00:33:30.231 --> 00:33:32.840
There's a fixed moment at which everyone deposits their money.

528
00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.850
So let's say they happen annually.

529
00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:38.690
The guy puts in $100 at the beginning of the year for the rest of the year.

530
00:33:38.691 --> 00:33:42.020
Nobody can do anything.
They can't take money out,
they can't put money in.

531
00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:44.870
So the hedge fund,
let's say,
um,

532
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:49.930
manages to get put the hundred dollars to work and finds a 7% return.

533
00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:51.201
Okay?

534
00:33:51.201 --> 00:33:56.000
So it's now got the hedge fund altogether has got $107.

535
00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:03.160
So let's just go to the hedge fund altogether.
Uh,

536
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.660
has a hundred,
had a hundred,

537
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:08.690
the hedge fund had a hundred after these guys,

538
00:34:08.691 --> 00:34:12.350
cause only one guy put in money and now the hedge funds got $107.
Well,

539
00:34:12.351 --> 00:34:16.250
that hundred $7 is all the first guy's money because nobody else has put

540
00:34:16.251 --> 00:34:20.990
anything in.
He still owns it.
Okay.
So,
so far the hedge fund got a 7% return.

541
00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:26.480
Well now the next year.
Okay.
We're now at the beginning of year two.
You know,

542
00:34:26.490 --> 00:34:31.340
our first investor thinks to himself,
well,
you know,
they did find 7% not great,

543
00:34:31.341 --> 00:34:34.730
but you know,
um,
I'm okay,
I'm not going to do anything.

544
00:34:34.731 --> 00:34:39.170
Won't take any money out or put any in a rich second investor puts in a thousand

545
00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:43.550
and another guy puts in 200.
Okay.

546
00:34:43.551 --> 00:34:48.200
So now what's happened to the,
um,
to the Nav of the fund?
Well,

547
00:34:48.201 --> 00:34:50.840
the first guy,
he's,
you know,
at the moment they put in the money.

548
00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:55.840
The first guy still has 107 and his first guy still owns 107 of the dollars.

549
00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:01.100
The second guy now got a thousand in the fund and the third guy's got 200 in the

550
00:35:01.101 --> 00:35:03.530
fund.
And the,
uh,

551
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:09.110
the hedge fund now has a 1200 plus the 107,

552
00:35:09.111 --> 00:35:12.200
that's 1307.
That's how much money's in the fun.
Okay.

553
00:35:12.201 --> 00:35:15.650
So that's at the beginning of year two.
If you're still following this,

554
00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.960
if you're not falling and interrupt me.
Sorry.
I mean,

555
00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:22.550
so what happens in year three in the beginning of the next year,

556
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:27.500
year three?
Well,
let's say our guy,
oh,
so the fund,

557
00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:32.210
the Hedge Fund makes money and this time it made 3% a crappier,

558
00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:36.830
sorry,
a less good return.
Only 3% of all on film.

559
00:35:36.831 --> 00:35:41.400
I'm glad that's going to live for bus yard anyway.
3% 3% return.

560
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:46.120
Okay.
And so the,
the hedge fund,
which started at uh,

561
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:51.470
1307 ended the year at 1307 now by the end of this next year,

562
00:35:51.601 --> 00:35:56.460
it's made 3% on that.
So that's uh,
you know,
it's up to 1346.

563
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:59.340
Okay.
So,
um,
you know,

564
00:35:59.341 --> 00:36:04.341
$39 3% on 1300 so 1346 now of that,

565
00:36:04.651 --> 00:36:08.550
who's got the money?
Well,
our original guy.
Okay.

566
00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:09.423
<v 3>He,</v>

567
00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:15.730
<v 0>he's now made everyone made 3% so his hundred seven turned into 110.</v>

568
00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:21.410
The second guy's got 10 30 in the fund and the third guy's got 206 in the fund.

569
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:25.730
Okay.
And the total fund is,
you know,
1346.
Now,

570
00:36:25.731 --> 00:36:30.620
let's suppose that our guy,
this is the beginning of year three,

571
00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:35.390
our first guy says 3%.
That's a terrible return.
I'm taking my money out.

572
00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:40.340
I've had it.
It's $110,
you know,
that's what I have.
I'm taking it out,
okay?

573
00:36:40.341 --> 00:36:43.520
So,
and no one else does anything.
So at the end of the year,
you know,

574
00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:47.630
now he's down to zero and everybody else's where they were okay in the hedge

575
00:36:47.631 --> 00:36:49.220
fund thing has gone down a little bit.
Well,

576
00:36:49.221 --> 00:36:54.020
now next year the thing does even worse,
it makes a 0% return.
Okay?

577
00:36:54.021 --> 00:36:58.610
So everybody's money's just the same except that the second guy decides,

578
00:36:58.611 --> 00:37:02.390
you know,
this is really getting lousy.
Uh,
and he takes half his money out.

579
00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:06.620
So this is taking half his money out.
What was his money?
He was,
you know,

580
00:37:06.621 --> 00:37:10.220
1112 and a half of that is five 56 so he takes half of it out,

581
00:37:10.221 --> 00:37:14.150
leaving half behind.
And that reduces,
you know,
in a column on the right,

582
00:37:14.151 --> 00:37:16.670
reduces what the hedge funds,
total caches.

583
00:37:16.671 --> 00:37:20.960
But now the hedge fund is a great year and it makes 50% okay.

584
00:37:20.961 --> 00:37:24.710
And having made 50%
um,

585
00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:29.443
<v 3>okay.</v>

586
00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:33.280
<v 0>Yeah.
Anyways,
so then,</v>

587
00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:38.470
oh,
sorry.
So this guy takes half his money out at the beginning of the year,

588
00:37:38.471 --> 00:37:41.500
the fund does badly.
Then the fun,
uh,

589
00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:47.220
I skipped the 8%.
There was an 8% return.
Sorry.
So all want immediate.
Anyway,

590
00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:50.770
Sophie,
uh,
the,
the,
the next year the fund return,

591
00:37:50.771 --> 00:37:55.770
not 0% return 8%.
Okay.
So the first guy,
after the 3% return,

592
00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.540
this guy took his money out,
the other guys left it in,

593
00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:02.200
and then the fund had an 8% return.
Okay.
So they are there,
you know,

594
00:38:02.201 --> 00:38:06.340
it's a little bit better,
but this guy decides to take half his money out.
Okay.

595
00:38:06.341 --> 00:38:10.480
And then,
then the fund has a 0% return.
And,

596
00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:14.680
and after that,
this guy decides to take his money out,
half his money out.

597
00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:19.300
But then finally the last year,
the fund gives a 50% return,

598
00:38:19.301 --> 00:38:21.160
which is fantastic.
So all of these guys,
you know,

599
00:38:21.161 --> 00:38:25.570
everybody does well and now let's say they all decide to take their money out.

600
00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:29.530
So now there's nothing left in the fund,
the funds and you know,

601
00:38:29.531 --> 00:38:33.730
they withdrew the total nine 34 okay.
So what I've done here,

602
00:38:33.731 --> 00:38:34.750
just to summarize,
it does,

603
00:38:34.751 --> 00:38:39.310
every people are putting in money or taking out of money at the beginning of the

604
00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:41.920
year,
you can never take out more than you have or you can put money in.

605
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:44.440
The fund earns returns over the whole year.

606
00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:48.010
And then people again decide to take PE money out or put money in and then the

607
00:38:48.011 --> 00:38:51.610
fun earns a different return the next year and eventually the fun,
you know,

608
00:38:51.611 --> 00:38:55.270
returns all the money or people withdrawal the money.
So the question is,

609
00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:56.230
<v 2>yeah,</v>

610
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:58.000
<v 0>how has the fun dude done?</v>

611
00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:02.950
How would you summarize in one number how the fund has done over?

612
00:39:02.951 --> 00:39:07.670
It's one,
two,
three,
four,
five years of earning returns.
That's the question.

613
00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:12.620
Okay.
So this is a standard,
you know,
this happens every day.

614
00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:16.730
I mean this is obviously what happens every day with hedge funds.
So how do you,

615
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:19.940
how do hedge funds report how they've done historically?

616
00:39:19.941 --> 00:39:21.260
So do you have any suggestions?

617
00:39:21.261 --> 00:39:24.490
What would you do to summarize how the Hedge Fund has done?

618
00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.290
If you had to pick one number,
what would it be?

619
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:34.470
How would an investor is the fund?

620
00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:36.990
<v 2>Hmm.
Yeah.</v>

621
00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:43.870
<v 0>Okay.
So one thing you could do is you could say,</v>

622
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:47.890
let's say what he said,
literally take,

623
00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:50.650
multiply all these returns.
What does that mean?

624
00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:53.380
That means if you put a dollar in the fund at the beginning,

625
00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.770
you learn 7% if you left it there and never took it out,

626
00:39:56.771 --> 00:40:01.771
you get another 3% then you'd get 8% on top of that than 0% then 50% of course

627
00:40:02.291 --> 00:40:03.760
this is a multiplicative thing.

628
00:40:03.761 --> 00:40:08.761
So he says you get 1.07 times 1.038 times 1.08 times one times 1.5 while

629
00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:11.493
deploying all that,

630
00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:15.410
give me the number of dollars you'd have at the end of five years,

631
00:40:15.411 --> 00:40:17.960
given that you put a dollar in in the beginning and never took it out.

632
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:22.790
And if you want it to annual why's that?
He said,
take the geometric average,

633
00:40:22.791 --> 00:40:24.620
the fifth root of that,

634
00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:29.270
and that's the constant rate of return that would have given you the same amount

635
00:40:29.271 --> 00:40:32.570
of money at the end that you would get by having left a dollar from the

636
00:40:32.571 --> 00:40:36.560
beginning in the fund all the way to the end.
That clear to everybody.

637
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:41.360
That seems like a logical thing to do.
Okay.
That's what money hedge funds do do.

638
00:40:41.361 --> 00:40:44.240
In fact,
that's the number they tell you.
Now,

639
00:40:44.241 --> 00:40:46.880
why might not that be a great number?

640
00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:51.850
Did everyone follow what his suggestion was?
So by the way,

641
00:40:51.851 --> 00:40:56.470
his number's gonna come out to be,
well,
I don't know.
Anyway,

642
00:40:56.471 --> 00:40:59.280
it's going to be some number we could do that.
Um,

643
00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:03.040
in fact it wouldn't be that hard to do.
Let's just do it.
Um,

644
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:12.250
<v 2>oh,
this wasn't a very,
ah,</v>

645
00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.820
<v 0>how about equals?</v>

646
00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:22.923
<v 2>Oh,</v>

647
00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:39.900
<v 4>oh dear.
All right.</v>

648
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:42.023
<v 2>Okay.</v>

649
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:47.120
<v 4>Circular reference.
Okay.</v>

650
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:48.523
<v 2>Okay.</v>

651
00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.450
<v 4>He calls some,</v>

652
00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.940
oh,
why do I have a zero?
Why did I get zero here?
Oh,

653
00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:05.590
cause I'm trying to multiply these ice adding still.
Okay.

654
00:42:05.591 --> 00:42:08.650
So equals I'll just have to do it one by one.

655
00:42:08.651 --> 00:42:12.280
That time's the next one,

656
00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:16.300
times the next one.
There's obviously a much faster way of doing this.

657
00:42:16.301 --> 00:42:21.250
Times the next one,
times that one,
and through.
Okay.

658
00:42:21.251 --> 00:42:24.520
So that's what a dollar would have gotten you if he put it in and kept it to the

659
00:42:24.521 --> 00:42:28.980
end.
And now he's saying,
take this to the fifth power.
So I'll take,

660
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.930
uh,
up,
um,

661
00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:36.310
this point to enter.
Okay,

662
00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:40.090
<v 0>12.2%.
All right.
Now,</v>

663
00:42:40.091 --> 00:42:43.780
why isn't that the right number?

664
00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.210
Why might you think there should be another number?

665
00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.160
What's another number?
What's the matter with that way back then?

666
00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:58.863
<v 2>Okay,</v>

667
00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:02.590
<v 0>well is it grossly inflated?
But why is it grossly inflated by that?</v>

668
00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.620
That's true.
But you've taken that into account.

669
00:43:08.621 --> 00:43:12.550
So the years we didn't do that well,
like the 0% return that got,

670
00:43:12.551 --> 00:43:17.230
that brought the average down.
So why is that a problem?

671
00:43:17.231 --> 00:43:21.070
Exactly.
Yeah.
It's averaging the good years with the bad years.
So,

672
00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.530
<v 2>um,
Yup.</v>

673
00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:33.750
<v 0>Okay.
That's the crucial thing.
So,
uh,</v>

674
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:37.960
I didn't do extreme enough numbers,
but let's,
let's,
uh,

675
00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:42.670
the crucial thing to take into account is that,

676
00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:47.590
um,
suppose you have a fund that starts off many funds.

677
00:43:47.591 --> 00:43:50.320
Like my funds started off with very little money,

678
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:52.960
but we did it at the right time because we,
you know,

679
00:43:52.961 --> 00:43:54.310
we knew that was a good time.

680
00:43:54.311 --> 00:43:56.320
You're going to see when the leverage cycle we talk about,

681
00:43:56.321 --> 00:43:59.950
it was at the bottom of the leverage cycle,
just like this past year,
you know,

682
00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:03.040
we're up 30% this year.
So at the bottom of the leverage cycle,

683
00:44:03.041 --> 00:44:04.630
you're going to have a great year.
Of course,

684
00:44:04.631 --> 00:44:08.530
we hardly had any money because the fund was,
uh,
just starting.

685
00:44:08.531 --> 00:44:12.880
And so we made 50% the first year.
Okay.
But then everybody said,
oh,

686
00:44:12.881 --> 00:44:14.410
these guys must be geniuses.

687
00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:17.350
And they poured a huge amount of money into our fund.

688
00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:22.060
And let's say the next year we did a 10%.
Actually,

689
00:44:22.061 --> 00:44:23.740
we had another great year the second year.

690
00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:26.650
But let's say that we did 10% the second year.

691
00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:30.430
So the young man in the front is saying,
you know,

692
00:44:30.431 --> 00:44:35.431
you made 50 on pennies and then you ate 10% on a gigantic amount of money.

693
00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:37.440
It isn't right to take,
you know,

694
00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:41.330
the average of 50% and 10% because almost all the money that you managed,

695
00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:45.030
you make 10% on not 50% and that's his point.
Okay.

696
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:47.190
So how would you deal with his point?

697
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:52.790
How could you figure out a way of computing the right return to compensate for

698
00:44:53.101 --> 00:44:56.200
the fact that some years you have a lot more money at stake then you have love

699
00:44:56.201 --> 00:44:57.120
of years?
Yes.

700
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:58.543
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

701
00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:01.410
<v 0>Take a weighted average.
Well how would you take the weighted average?</v>

702
00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:07.020
Sounds a little complicated.
That's what I'm going to do.

703
00:45:07.021 --> 00:45:10.170
But it's not immediately obvious how to do it.
So anybody,

704
00:45:10.171 --> 00:45:12.300
so I wouldn't have expected you to be able to answer that.

705
00:45:12.301 --> 00:45:16.590
That's you're right on the right track.
So anyone have any thing else to say?
Yup.

706
00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:29.413
<v 2>Okay.</v>

707
00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.140
<v 0>Um,
all right,
so I'm going,</v>

708
00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:37.340
so I'm going to now give you the answer,
which is a little bit like that.

709
00:45:37.341 --> 00:45:42.240
She's saying do some dollar weighted thing.
And so,
you know,
you,
you,
uh,

710
00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:47.280
somehow weight the numbers by how much money there was invested for that year.

711
00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:50.400
So because it was a lot more money invested in here,
you know,

712
00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:52.100
three than there was in year one,

713
00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:56.240
that number should have somehow have a bigger way.
And uh,

714
00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:57.530
<v 2>okay.</v>

715
00:45:57.530 --> 00:46:00.770
<v 0>You know,
it's not exactly clear how the weights are going to get in there,</v>

716
00:46:00.771 --> 00:46:03.980
but that's obvious that that's something like that you ought to do.

717
00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:09.160
So here's the mathematical solution that um,

718
00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:12.740
the internal rate of return or yield,
uh,
gives.

719
00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:17.360
So it says,
let's look every year,

720
00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:22.340
let's look at what happened in the fund.
So you know,
for,
for,

721
00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:23.120
you know,

722
00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:28.120
if we shouldn't care about which investor put in which dollar we care about how

723
00:46:28.701 --> 00:46:32.420
the fund managed dollars,
the name is of the investors don't make any difference.

724
00:46:32.421 --> 00:46:36.110
It's how did the fund manage its money?
So the first year,

725
00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:40.910
the fun got $100.
So as for producing money,

726
00:46:40.911 --> 00:46:44.150
it produced a a negative hundred,
you know,
money went into the fund.

727
00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:47.030
That was the one guy invested.
We don't care who it was.

728
00:46:47.031 --> 00:46:50.960
The total that went into the fund was a hundred the sag it year 1200 went into

729
00:46:50.961 --> 00:46:54.440
the fund.
Those are the second two guys.
The third year,

730
00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:57.320
110 came out.
That was the first guy.

731
00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:02.390
The the fourth year 556 came out.
That was the second guy.

732
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:06.230
The third,
the f the,
this is the beginning of a fifth year.

733
00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:11.440
The third guy took out $155 and then the last year the second and third guys

734
00:47:12.051 --> 00:47:13.400
took out everything that was left.

735
00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:17.480
So from the point of view of money creation and use,

736
00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:21.110
this is every year.
What went into the fond and what came out of the fund?

737
00:47:21.111 --> 00:47:25.640
The net inflow out.
Okay,
so there are a bunch of numbers.

738
00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:30.010
Now
the question is,
so the,

739
00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:33.880
the one number summary is what rate of return,

740
00:47:33.881 --> 00:47:35.800
it's called the internal rate of return,

741
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:38.710
which if you discounted all of these numbers,

742
00:47:38.711 --> 00:47:42.150
what would Fisher say if you discounted all of these numbers?
Fish.
If you had,

743
00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:45.770
if you had to use just one interest rate,
Fisher would say,
these kids,

744
00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:49.390
what's the present value of these cash flows?
Will,
if the interest rate was zero,

745
00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:52.300
you just add up all the numbers and you're going to get a big positive.

746
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:57.160
If the interest rate is infinity,
then that means that the,
the,
you know,

747
00:47:57.161 --> 00:47:59.920
after the first year you're discounting everything to zero and you're going to

748
00:47:59.921 --> 00:48:03.070
get negative 100 so you could say,

749
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:08.100
what interest rate could you discount all the cash flows at to produce zero.

750
00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:12.010
That would be like saying at that interest rate,

751
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:15.730
all the fund has done is rearranged.
It's money,

752
00:48:15.731 --> 00:48:19.720
it's taken money in and put money out.
But at that same constant interest rate,

753
00:48:19.721 --> 00:48:22.210
the present value is zero.
So it's basically,

754
00:48:22.211 --> 00:48:27.130
it's allowed you to trade money across periods at this internal rate of return.

755
00:48:27.131 --> 00:48:31.000
The interest rate,
which makes the present value zero.
So if you guessed,

756
00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:37.750
if you guessed,
uh,
so 10% turns out to be the right number.

757
00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:41.920
So if you discounted things by 10%,
you would take and see what the formula is.

758
00:48:41.921 --> 00:48:46.921
You take the inflow and you discount it by 1.1 to the first power and this huge

759
00:48:46.981 --> 00:48:50.220
discount by one oh 1.1 to the second power this.

760
00:48:50.221 --> 00:48:52.050
But you know the inflow,

761
00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:57.130
the net outflow I guess which is 110 you discount by the third,

762
00:48:57.370 --> 00:49:02.350
you know,
1.1 to the third power,
et cetera.
You keep discounting by that.
Okay.

763
00:49:02.351 --> 00:49:04.240
And you get all the discounted net flows,

764
00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:08.110
you add them all up and you'd get practically nothing that's adding them up.

765
00:49:08.111 --> 00:49:12.280
And this is taking the square and I use solver to figure out what the right

766
00:49:12.281 --> 00:49:16.480
discount,
wait,
wait was to make all the zero.
So that's the,

767
00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:22.060
that's the simple way of averaging,
you know,
dollar waiting,
everything you,
you,

768
00:49:22.061 --> 00:49:26.180
you,
you don't care about who the people are,
you don't care about,
uh,

769
00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:29.440
whether one guy's putting money in,
another guy's taking it out at the same time,

770
00:49:29.441 --> 00:49:32.560
he just care about the net.
And you've got a bunch of net numbers.

771
00:49:32.561 --> 00:49:36.010
That's the net outflow and you're trying to say,
what's the one,

772
00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:40.840
what's the single rate of return?
The idea is to say at what interest rate,

773
00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:42.490
if you,

774
00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:46.680
if there were a bank paying an interest rate and all those things discounted,

775
00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:47.530
gave you zero,

776
00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:50.590
that would be like saying the fund is functioning just like a bank,

777
00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:53.350
no matter when people put the money in or take it out,

778
00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:57.190
they're always getting this rate of return,
which is 10% okay,

779
00:49:57.191 --> 00:50:00.430
so they're getting a constant 10% rate of return no matter when the money goes

780
00:50:00.431 --> 00:50:04.870
in or out.
And that's kind of gives you a measure of how well the fund is doing.

781
00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:09.700
Okay,
so that's the internal rate of return it says,
or the yield to maturity.

782
00:50:09.701 --> 00:50:14.260
It says take the net cash flows every year,
find the number,
find the number,

783
00:50:14.261 --> 00:50:18.190
which when you discount at that number,
you get present value equal to zero.

784
00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:20.220
<v 3>Okay?</v>

785
00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:20.790
<v 0>Okay,</v>

786
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:25.790
so it's 10% which is a different number from 12% now before we got the geometric

787
00:50:28.551 --> 00:50:31.340
average of 12% now very typically,

788
00:50:31.341 --> 00:50:36.341
this is the case that this internal rate of return is lower than the,

789
00:50:36.610 --> 00:50:39.860
you know,
dollar return from putting the money in at the beginning.

790
00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:43.250
Assuming the fund doesn't just collapse and go to zero at the end.

791
00:50:43.251 --> 00:50:45.860
So why is that?
For funds that have survived,

792
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:50.360
typically that number 12% is higher than 10% why would that be

793
00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:51.660
<v 2>okay?</v>

794
00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:55.480
<v 0>What does that tell you about the world?
Oh,</v>

795
00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:57.880
someone who hasn't the while you go ahead.

796
00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:01.410
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

797
00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:05.010
<v 0>It tells you that and why and how is it that the hedge fund,
okay.</v>

798
00:51:05.011 --> 00:51:08.190
Could tell you that it tells you that the hedge funds are doing better when they

799
00:51:08.191 --> 00:51:10.680
have a smaller amount of money that when they have a larger amount of money.

800
00:51:10.681 --> 00:51:11.340
Exactly.

801
00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:14.970
You've concluded that it's easier to make money when you have a small amount.

802
00:51:14.971 --> 00:51:16.920
What's another possible explanation?

803
00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:18.413
<v 2>Yup.</v>

804
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:23.170
<v 0>Right.
I think that's the reason.</v>

805
00:51:23.171 --> 00:51:28.000
The reason is that people pour money into hedge funds just after they've done

806
00:51:28.001 --> 00:51:31.090
incredibly well and they keep pouring money and then eventually there was a

807
00:51:31.091 --> 00:51:32.770
blowup.
And so when the blog comes,

808
00:51:32.771 --> 00:51:35.510
the hedge funds have zillions of dollars and they're,
you know,

809
00:51:35.590 --> 00:51:38.880
they're losing a lot of money,
losing a lot of money.
And then,
you know,

810
00:51:38.881 --> 00:51:42.760
then everybody pulls their money out and that's when the cycle is going up and

811
00:51:42.761 --> 00:51:45.100
all of a sudden the hedge funds have these huge returns again,

812
00:51:45.101 --> 00:51:49.840
but they hardly have any money.
So.
Okay.
Any other questions about this?

813
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:52.300
<v 2>Okay.</v>

814
00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:57.240
<v 0>All right.
So internal rate of return is the way to uh,</v>

815
00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:00.690
is a way we're going to see that as many shortcomings,

816
00:52:00.691 --> 00:52:05.130
but it's a way at getting at the idea as several of you have said that you can't

817
00:52:05.131 --> 00:52:06.990
just take the geometric average,

818
00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:10.620
which is what every hedge fund like ours always produces.

819
00:52:10.621 --> 00:52:13.500
That's the number we tell everybody because it's a better number than the other

820
00:52:13.501 --> 00:52:18.480
one.
So the internal rate of the,
the,
the geometric average of the returns are,

821
00:52:18.481 --> 00:52:21.930
if you're an investor who puts a dollar in at the beginning and leaves it there

822
00:52:21.931 --> 00:52:24.760
forever,
you know,
what's your g,

823
00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:28.230
your geometric average of all your returns.

824
00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:31.680
That's not a good reflection of how the hedge fund's done necessarily because

825
00:52:31.681 --> 00:52:34.170
some years the fund had a lot of money to work with.

826
00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:37.350
And so the average dollar didn't do that well.

827
00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:40.650
And now there's a question about how should you measure the average dollar.

828
00:52:40.830 --> 00:52:42.660
And I've given the internal rate of return.

829
00:52:42.661 --> 00:52:44.980
There are actually other formulas you could give.
This one isn't,

830
00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:50.790
this is the most famous one.
Okay.
So,
um,
all right.

831
00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:56.150
Now let's see how this internal rate of return is used all the time on Wall

832
00:52:56.821 --> 00:52:57.654
Street.

833
00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:59.263
<v 2>Okay?</v>

834
00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.920
<v 0>By the way,
if you're not following what I'm saying,
you should,
uh,</v>

835
00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:06.570
please interrupt me.
Okay?
So what if you took a bond,

836
00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:11.520
a simple coupon bond?
Okay,
well,
a simple coupon bond.

837
00:53:11.550 --> 00:53:16.080
What does a simple coupon bond,
the yield to maturity of a simple coupon bond.

838
00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:18.810
I'm now on this lecture called yield.

839
00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:24.020
What is the simple coupon bond is simple coupon bond pays the same coupon every

840
00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:27.360
year and then pays the and the coupon at its maturity.

841
00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:32.690
So the yield to maturity is going to be the price which was like a negative

842
00:53:32.911 --> 00:53:36.810
payment.
Okay.
Such that if you,

843
00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:39.300
so if you knew the price,
suppose you,
sorry.

844
00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:42.750
Suppose you knew the price of this bond.

845
00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:45.450
If you knew the price of the bond.
Okay.

846
00:53:45.451 --> 00:53:49.380
And so the bond is promising all these payments,
how good a deal is that?

847
00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:54.410
Well how good a deal it is they would say is you simply take this first negative

848
00:53:54.871 --> 00:53:58.740
payment and all these positive payments and find the unique interest rate,

849
00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:02.520
which when you discount it will give you present value of zero.

850
00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.340
And so if this is a coupon bond,

851
00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:08.040
say paying 7% you know,

852
00:54:08.041 --> 00:54:13.041
say the face is a hundred and pay $7 forever and 107 at the end and the price is

853
00:54:13.471 --> 00:54:17.730
105 what do you think the yield to maturity is going to be?

854
00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:23.000
Is it going to be or can you say anything qualitative about it?

855
00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:28.010
Suppose it's a 7% coupon bond face of 110 year bond.

856
00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:30.450
No one thinks that it'll default,

857
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:35.630
but it's price is 105 what is the yield to maturity in that case?

858
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:40.670
Do you suppose?
It's just vague.
Guess I just want to qualitative

859
00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:41.813
<v 2>number</v>

860
00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:49.460
<v 0>6.7 okay,
that's qualitatively wrong.</v>

861
00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:50.733
<v 2>Okay,</v>

862
00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:55.300
<v 0>well maybe it's not qualitatively wrong.
No,
it's qualitatively right.</v>

863
00:54:55.301 --> 00:54:58.100
It's just not okay.
It could have been better,
but okay,
so he's right.
So what,

864
00:54:58.200 --> 00:54:59.350
so what if the PR,

865
00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:03.220
what if the price were a hundred what would the yield to maturity?
B,

866
00:55:05.410 --> 00:55:08.920
7% that's obvious,
right?
So if the price of the bond,

867
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:13.950
if it's a 7% coupon bond on principle on face of a hundred and it's price is a

868
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:15.310
hundred price equal to the face,

869
00:55:15.311 --> 00:55:20.020
and obviously the thing that discounts you back to a hundred is going to be 7%

870
00:55:20.021 --> 00:55:20.560
interest.

871
00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:25.060
So if the price were a hundred the yield of maturity would just be 7% but I told

872
00:55:25.061 --> 00:55:29.230
you the price was 105 which is a lot more expensive.
So it's a bad deal.

873
00:55:29.231 --> 00:55:33.850
So it's not going to be as good as 107 so it's not going to be 7% and he said

874
00:55:33.851 --> 00:55:38.170
6.7 okay.
So I think it would be a little worse than that,

875
00:55:38.171 --> 00:55:41.650
but that's qualitatively just what I asked for something worse than 7%

876
00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:46.870
okay.
So who said 6.7% you did.
Okay.
So

877
00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:55.733
<v 2>Yup.</v>

878
00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:06.050
<v 0>That's okay.
So that's another number.
Okay.
That's called.
Okay.
So,
okay,</v>

879
00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:09.000
so let's,
let's cut.
Okay,
so does it,
okay,

880
00:56:09.001 --> 00:56:10.950
so I'm going to come back to your question.
So good question.

881
00:56:10.951 --> 00:56:13.020
So do you see that the price,

882
00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:18.080
do you all see that if you measured the yield to maturity on this bond?

883
00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:27.240
Okay,
the ultimate saw the bond,

884
00:56:27.241 --> 00:56:32.241
remember pays seven seven seven 107 k and its price is 105

885
00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:38.890
<v 3>okay?</v>

886
00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:39.580
<v 0>Okay.</v>

887
00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:44.580
So the yield to maturity is going to be that number such that 105 equals seven

888
00:56:46.091 --> 00:56:51.091
over one plus the yield plus seven over one plus the yield squared plus seven

889
00:56:53.201 --> 00:56:58.201
over one plus the yield cubed plus hundred seven over one plus yield to the 10th

890
00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:01.481
okay,

891
00:57:01.481 --> 00:57:06.481
that's 105 so what we observed is that why has to be less than 7%

892
00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:16.400
because if why were exactly equal to 7% this would give us a hundred but this

893
00:57:16.401 --> 00:57:20.930
bond is more expensive.
So you're paying more to get the same payments.

894
00:57:20.931 --> 00:57:22.970
You would then the face,

895
00:57:22.971 --> 00:57:25.250
you're paying more than the face to get the same payment.

896
00:57:25.251 --> 00:57:27.740
If the price were equal to the face,
it would be a 7% yield.

897
00:57:27.741 --> 00:57:30.650
So since you're paying more,
you're getting a worse deal.

898
00:57:30.651 --> 00:57:34.840
So it's pretty obvious that if you want to discount this number two more than

899
00:57:34.841 --> 00:57:39.680
100 and 105 why's going to have to be less than 7% okay?

900
00:57:39.681 --> 00:57:42.470
So that's the first thing we said.
Now what did he do?

901
00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:47.270
He gave a number and he said seven over

902
00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:49.153
<v 3>mmm.</v>

903
00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:55.090
<v 0>Seven over 105 which he said was about 6.7%</v>

904
00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:57.753
<v 3>yeah.</v>

905
00:57:57.960 --> 00:57:58.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

906
00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:03.480
So that number that he gave is called,

907
00:58:03.481 --> 00:58:08.010
the current is called the,
uh,
current yield

908
00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:14.670
nother number people gate give.
Okay.

909
00:58:14.671 --> 00:58:19.470
And he figured that was 6.7%.
So let's believe him that 6.7%.

910
00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:21.390
Okay.
Now,

911
00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:25.630
<v 3>okay.</v>

912
00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:29.620
<v 0>So,
and the,
and the,
and the,
okay.
How does that number compare to the yield?</v>

913
00:58:29.621 --> 00:58:30.454
To maturity.

914
00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:32.993
<v 3>Okay.</v>

915
00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:33.913
<v 0>To why.</v>

916
00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:41.403
<v 3>Okay.</v>

917
00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:44.460
<v 0>Well,
we could compute this out.</v>

918
00:58:44.590 --> 00:58:49.030
<v 4>Oh,
on Xcel since I'm doing so brilliantly at it now.</v>

919
00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:53.950
Um,
oh,
okay.

920
00:58:53.951 --> 00:58:56.050
So we could go,
you know,

921
00:58:56.820 --> 00:59:01.110
<v 5>seven,
seven,
seven,
seven,
seven,
seven,
seven,</v>

922
00:59:01.111 --> 00:59:02.720
seven,
seven

923
00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:06.200
<v 4>and 107.
Okay.
Those are our payments.</v>

924
00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:10.730
And then we could try some yield to maturity in general,

925
00:59:10.731 --> 00:59:15.350
rate of return,
internal rate of return.
And let's call it,

926
00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:19.040
that's gas 1.067.

927
00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:24.470
Okay.
And now we'd say that the present,

928
00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:28.430
the cashflows is going to be,
this is going to be the left.
Uh,

929
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:34.670
oh dear.
I have to number things.
So again,

930
00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:38.840
there's probably some clever way of doing this.
So this'll be,
I forgot the,

931
00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:43.820
to write the year.
Okay,
thanks.

932
00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:50.110
Okay,
so this is,
let's just go into,
let's just add this,
uh,

933
00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:56.230
equals up plus Hunter Hayes.

934
00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:59.520
And I'm just going to copy this.
All right.
So now I have numbered all the years

935
01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:10.260
equals up plus one enter and now control copy.

936
01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:12.693
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

937
01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:16.690
<v 4>Okay.
So I've numbered all the years here and here are the payments.</v>

938
01:00:16.691 --> 01:00:20.410
And now at this,
at this a yield to maturity,

939
01:00:20.411 --> 01:00:25.411
I'm going to go equal the thing on the left divided by the,

940
01:00:26.130 --> 01:00:30.500
uh,
yield to maturity that we're guessing.
MMM.

941
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:33.920
Hi.
Uh,
raise to this power.

942
01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:40.800
Okay.
And now I can just copy that and I've got all these cash flows.

943
01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:44.520
What did I do that time?

944
01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:55.540
Control copy.
Sorry.

945
01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:06.170
Control copy.
Right.
So I just want a copy of this.
Oh,

946
01:01:06.171 --> 01:01:10.040
I see.
Yeah,
yeah.
Right,
right,
right,
right.
Okay.
So I have to hear,
I've got the,

947
01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:15.200
the uh,
your rights I've got,
okay.
So there's a trick here,
which I forgot,

948
01:01:15.201 --> 01:01:19.090
which is that Eight v,
the discount rate,
the internal rate of return.
He,

949
01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:23.900
I haven't got to put a dollar sign.
Dollar e dollar one.

950
01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:29.350
So that way it remembers the spot.
Okay.

951
01:01:29.351 --> 01:01:32.950
So now I want to copy it.
It's going to remember that.

952
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:37.360
Okay.
What's B One?

953
01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:39.383
<v 2>Perfect.</v>

954
01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:46.290
<v 4>Oh B one.
Thank you.
So are two mistakes
me?</v>

955
01:01:46.291 --> 01:01:47.124
One.

956
01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:54.320
Okay.
He's so now control copy.

957
01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:55.530
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

958
01:01:55.530 --> 01:01:59.430
<v 0>So I'm supposed to be showing you how easy it is to do this,
but uh,
all right.</v>

959
01:01:59.431 --> 01:02:02.280
So anyway,
that's it.
So you see for each number here,

960
01:02:02.281 --> 01:02:05.940
I've got the payments for every year and I've discounted them by taking this

961
01:02:05.941 --> 01:02:10.140
internal rate of return.
Okay?
And now I just have to sum all this

962
01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:14.340
<v 4>e equals some.</v>

963
01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:16.693
Um,

964
01:02:22.850 --> 01:02:23.683
<v 2>oh shit.</v>

965
01:02:29.290 --> 01:02:34.030
<v 4>I'm trying to sound like you're right.
So C,
okay,</v>

966
01:02:34.031 --> 01:02:38.620
so here equals I want to sum all these.
So what did I do wrong?

967
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:46.820
C One Colon,
say 10.

968
01:02:46.821 --> 01:02:50.840
That's what I thought I did,
but obviously I didn't.
Okay,
good.

969
01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:56.120
And now we can do this and the square it.
Okay.

970
01:02:56.121 --> 01:02:58.040
So that's the thing I want to minimize.

971
01:02:58.041 --> 01:03:02.630
And so now I'm going to tools solver.

972
01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:08.300
Men,
man,

973
01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:14.050
see 12 by concentrating on this number.

974
01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:16.690
Okay.
And solve,

975
01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:26.550
all right,
what did I do?

976
01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.620
Here's this song,
here's the scoop,

977
01:03:39.730 --> 01:03:43.660
all the original price.
[inaudible] thank you very much.
Okay,

978
01:03:43.661 --> 01:03:47.990
so we need the original price was 105.
Very good.

979
01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:51.550
And so I see the preparing,
this would have helped.
Okay,
so here's the sum.

980
01:03:51.551 --> 01:03:55.660
So he just summed all these things.
Okay.
And here we're going to,
um,

981
01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:57.933
<v 2>uh,</v>

982
01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:04.480
<v 4>all right,
let's just,
okay,
so we're summing those rights.</v>

983
01:04:04.481 --> 01:04:09.481
So I summed all these and then I've got the original price Hun.

984
01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:13.660
105 and tear,
okay,

985
01:04:13.661 --> 01:04:18.160
now we'll add equals this.

986
01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:20.633
<v 2>MMM.</v>

987
01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:24.303
<v 4>Plus.</v>

988
01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:30.953
<v 2>Okay.</v>

989
01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:38.350
<v 4>Okay,
you're right.
Okay.
This minus that.</v>

990
01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:39.713
<v 2>Okay.</v>

991
01:04:45.610 --> 01:04:49.150
<v 4>Okay.
And now we want to square this equals up,</v>

992
01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:55.210
squared and,
and now we'll do solver.
Hopefully there isn't another mistake.

993
01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.190
Okay,
so

994
01:04:58.390 --> 01:05:01.630
<v 2>tools solver.</v>

995
01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:03.693
Um,

996
01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:10.420
<v 4>okay,
so I want lat times a one.</v>

997
01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:14.553
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

998
01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:18.330
<v 4>Oh,
that's very bad.
Okay.
Anyway,</v>

999
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:23.340
<v 0>you can solve it using solar and it's extremely simple to do.</v>

1000
01:05:23.830 --> 01:05:26.650
And a child could learn how to do it.
Okay?

1001
01:05:26.651 --> 01:05:30.170
So we get solver and we solve all this.
Um,
and you're,

1002
01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:35.140
you should be able to use XL with no problem at all.
So,
um,

1003
01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:36.191
okay,

1004
01:05:36.191 --> 01:05:40.330
so the question is what are the relationships between the current yield and the

1005
01:05:40.331 --> 01:05:43.660
yield to maturity?
And suppose there some actual interest rate.

1006
01:05:43.930 --> 01:05:46.660
So there's an actual market interest rate,

1007
01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:53.700
market interest rate,
um,
say you know,

1008
01:05:53.701 --> 01:05:56.280
6% or something.
Okay.

1009
01:05:56.340 --> 01:06:00.120
So those are the things that we want to sort out now in the next five minutes.

1010
01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:05.310
So I'll let me go back to the notes and we'll re ask all the questions here.

1011
01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:13.640
I can see that solver.
I brokens

1012
01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:16.083
<v 3>yeah.</v>

1013
01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.540
<v 0>Okay.
All right.
So,</v>

1014
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:24.200
okay,
so let's,
um,

1015
01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:28.760
so suppose that the right actual interest rate in the economy

1016
01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:37.120
then our bond,
the bond that was seven,
seven,
seven,

1017
01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:41.920
107.
If the actual interest rate was say 6%.

1018
01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:47.680
Okay.
The price of the bond would be more than a hundred.
So some price,

1019
01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:50.530
which will be the present value will be greater than a hundred,

1020
01:06:50.531 --> 01:06:53.220
obviously because it's paying.
If it were it,

1021
01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.840
if the price is only if the interest rate's only 6%,

1022
01:06:55.841 --> 01:06:59.020
this is giving you more than a hundred.
Now the current yield

1023
01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:07.250
is,
uh,
seven over the present value.

1024
01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:12.110
Exactly what analogous to what he said.
Okay,
so if you,

1025
01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:15.380
if someone calls you on the phone,
you haven't gotten these calls yet,

1026
01:07:15.381 --> 01:07:19.280
but when you get older you'll get,
unless you,
you know their their screen now.

1027
01:07:19.281 --> 01:07:21.530
So it's harder to get these,
but it used to be a few years ago,

1028
01:07:21.531 --> 01:07:25.970
you get called on the phone quite often and somebody would say he's running a

1029
01:07:25.971 --> 01:07:29.750
bond fund and the bond fund is really doing great.

1030
01:07:30.050 --> 01:07:35.030
Anyone's to tell you that the bonds they have in the fun last year paid a

1031
01:07:35.031 --> 01:07:38.420
current yield of seven over the present value,

1032
01:07:38.570 --> 01:07:43.570
which is much bigger than the interest rate of 6% and therefore you should buy

1033
01:07:43.731 --> 01:07:46.360
his bonds.
Okay.

1034
01:07:46.361 --> 01:07:50.650
Now what can you say about that?

1035
01:07:52.090 --> 01:07:56.890
Suppose somebody tells you there's a market price for the bonds.
Okay.

1036
01:07:56.891 --> 01:08:01.750
Which we know is the present value at the interest rate of 6% and he tells you

1037
01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:06.520
that,
look,
look at the market value I got last year for these,
the yield,

1038
01:08:06.521 --> 01:08:09.850
I got the current yield I got on these bonds,
the present value,

1039
01:08:09.851 --> 01:08:13.710
once you know some number bigger than a hundred but I take seven over a hundred

1040
01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:17.870
over the present value and I get something bigger than 6% at your bank,

1041
01:08:17.871 --> 01:08:22.670
you're only getting 6% so therefore it,
you know you shouldn't invest in my fun.

1042
01:08:24.230 --> 01:08:25.460
So why is that?

1043
01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:31.580
I mean is that a good argument to invest in his fund?
Why not?

1044
01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:49.720
Okay,
now this bond is called a premium bond

1045
01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:55.240
<v 3>because the price</v>

1046
01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:58.860
<v 0>is bigger than the face.</v>

1047
01:09:00.130 --> 01:09:01.620
<v 3>No discount bond</v>

1048
01:09:05.130 --> 01:09:07.290
<v 0>means the price is less than the face</v>

1049
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:10.610
<v 3>and a power bond.</v>

1050
01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.560
<v 0>The price equals the face.</v>

1051
01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:19.473
<v 3>So</v>

1052
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000
<v 0>just because a bond pays a coupon of seven it may be when the bond was issued,</v>

1053
01:09:26.431 --> 01:09:29.310
everybody thought the interest rate was going to be 7% forever.

1054
01:09:29.311 --> 01:09:32.270
So that's why they pick the coupon of seven and that's,
and the,

1055
01:09:32.350 --> 01:09:36.240
so that the price when they first issued it would be equal to its face value,

1056
01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:40.740
but you know,
maybe the next day,
so it's still a 10 year bond.

1057
01:09:40.741 --> 01:09:42.270
Practically no time has changed,

1058
01:09:42.271 --> 01:09:47.271
but unexpectedly the interest rates fell to 6% if you take the same coupon bond

1059
01:09:47.341 --> 01:09:49.890
paying seven all the time at 6% interest,

1060
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:52.380
it's now it's,

1061
01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:56.250
it's price is obviously going to go up in the market because everybody is going

1062
01:09:56.251 --> 01:09:57.480
to discount the seven's,

1063
01:09:57.481 --> 01:10:02.250
not at 7% but at 6% and get a number that's bigger than a hundred okay,

1064
01:10:02.251 --> 01:10:06.240
so you're going to have to pay more for the bond because the,
you know,

1065
01:10:06.241 --> 01:10:09.270
the present value is higher.
However,

1066
01:10:09.450 --> 01:10:14.430
people who now will try and market the bond,
they're going to tell you,

1067
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:17.370
well look at the market price,
whatever the market price is.

1068
01:10:17.371 --> 01:10:21.120
So this is the current yield is the market price.
Okay.
They'll say,

1069
01:10:21.121 --> 01:10:25.230
look at the market price.
This is what we bought the bonds for.
You know,

1070
01:10:25.231 --> 01:10:29.250
I'm a fond,
I went out and bought these bonds for present value,
you know,

1071
01:10:29.251 --> 01:10:34.170
and I now look at the price I paid and I got $7 for these bonds,

1072
01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:34.651
you know,

1073
01:10:34.651 --> 01:10:39.510
this year in income and seven over the market price of the bond is bigger than

1074
01:10:39.511 --> 01:10:44.310
6% so I was doing a great job.
You should invest in my fun.

1075
01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:45.091
Okay.

1076
01:10:45.091 --> 01:10:50.091
So that can't be a correct thing to say or a persuasive thing to say because the

1077
01:10:50.701 --> 01:10:55.701
market price reflected the fact that the interest rate for 6% everybody was

1078
01:10:55.981 --> 01:10:58.950
properly computing the present value.

1079
01:10:58.951 --> 01:11:01.440
And let's say the market price was equal to the present value.

1080
01:11:01.650 --> 01:11:06.300
Present value would indeed be a greater than a hundred and in fact the market

1081
01:11:06.301 --> 01:11:08.460
price would be the,
the,

1082
01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:12.780
the current yield would be more than the interest rate of 6%.

1083
01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:14.010
So why is that?

1084
01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:21.180
So I claim seven also theorem.

1085
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:27.690
<v 2>If,
uh,
if</v>

1086
01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:29.490
<v 0>market price</v>

1087
01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:35.200
price equals present value

1088
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:39.240
<v 2>at,
uh,
at,
uh,</v>

1089
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:40.820
<v 0>going interest rate,</v>

1090
01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:47.013
<v 2>van</v>

1091
01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:48.810
<v 0>high yield</v>

1092
01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:54.470
on a premium bond

1093
01:11:58.730 --> 01:12:01.910
is always greater radar,

1094
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:06.170
then the interest and the interest rate.

1095
01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.300
Okay.
So why is that?

1096
01:12:19.090 --> 01:12:23.170
So in this case,
if I hadn't screwed up the XL,

1097
01:12:23.171 --> 01:12:27.370
we would have calculating the present value.
Okay.
So seven,
seven,
seven,

1098
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:29.920
107,
there was only a 6% interest.

1099
01:12:29.921 --> 01:12:33.820
So everybody taught by Irving Fisher computes the new present value,

1100
01:12:33.821 --> 01:12:37.630
which of course is bigger than a hundred and that's the market price.

1101
01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:41.910
Some unscrupulous salesmen,
uh,

1102
01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:43.240
starts a fund,

1103
01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:47.080
buys the bond for whatever this present value of the market prices.

1104
01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:51.880
Then goes out to a bunch of clients,
potential clients,
investors,
and says,
look,

1105
01:12:51.881 --> 01:12:55.060
my very first year in business I spent,
you know,

1106
01:12:55.150 --> 01:12:59.200
a little more than a hundred dollars and I got $7 as a coupon and seven over

1107
01:12:59.201 --> 01:13:02.170
this.
You know,
little more than a hundred is giving me,

1108
01:13:02.171 --> 01:13:05.260
obviously occurring that he's giving me a current year that's more than 6%.

1109
01:13:05.261 --> 01:13:08.920
I beat the interest rate.
You should invest in me.
And by the way,

1110
01:13:08.921 --> 01:13:12.610
I'll charge you a little fee to do that because I'm doing so great now.

1111
01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:14.320
That's always going to be the case.

1112
01:13:14.321 --> 01:13:17.560
So it has to be that he really hasn't accomplished anything at all.

1113
01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:21.940
So why is it easy to see that whenever I computed the present value,

1114
01:13:22.090 --> 01:13:26.950
it was going to have to be more than this.

1115
01:13:26.951 --> 01:13:31.240
Current yield would always be more than 6% how do I know that?
Yup.

1116
01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:43.090
<v 2>Perfect.
Relatively higher.</v>

1117
01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:45.060
It's going to mean to your original face though.

1118
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:46.423
<v 0>Exactly.</v>

1119
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:52.590
So let's say to keep this simpler,
let's oppose,

1120
01:13:52.610 --> 01:13:54.410
these were tens everywhere.

1121
01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:02.130
Okay.
And the interest rate went down to 5%

1122
01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:08.790
okay.
Now what's going to be the present value of this bond?

1123
01:14:09.450 --> 01:14:12.300
It's not going to be 200 if,
if,

1124
01:14:12.330 --> 01:14:15.040
if the bond paid 10 10

1125
01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:16.303
<v 1>uh,</v>

1126
01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:22.190
<v 0>210
okay.</v>

1127
01:14:22.191 --> 01:14:27.191
Suppose I have something paying 10 10 10 and 110 and the coupon is 5% what is

1128
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:32.630
the present value of this?
Like lame,
present value?

1129
01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:38.890
It's going to be less than 200 the coupon is always double the interest rate.

1130
01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:41.690
Okay.
So looks like,
you know,

1131
01:14:41.691 --> 01:14:44.990
that's what you'd get if you had $200 but at the end is he saying you're only

1132
01:14:44.991 --> 01:14:49.991
going to get 110 and not 210 so this present value of this thing has to be less

1133
01:14:50.961 --> 01:14:55.350
than 200 okay.
So if you double the coupon,
if you,

1134
01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:59.180
if you have the interest rate,
the interest rate was originally 10% here.

1135
01:14:59.270 --> 01:15:04.270
If you cut the interest rate in half to 5% it looks like your annual coupon is

1136
01:15:04.341 --> 01:15:05.300
double the interest rate.

1137
01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:10.370
But at the end you don't get a principal that's double the original principal.

1138
01:15:10.371 --> 01:15:11.920
All you did was double,
you know,

1139
01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:15.800
relative to the interest rate of 5% the coupons twice as big as you'd normally

1140
01:15:15.801 --> 01:15:17.180
expect,
but the face isn't.

1141
01:15:17.450 --> 01:15:22.310
So therefore this has to be worth less than 200 if it were a,

1142
01:15:22.311 --> 01:15:22.521
you know,

1143
01:15:22.521 --> 01:15:27.521
205% would give you 10 0101010210 okay.

1144
01:15:27.741 --> 01:15:29.530
But this gives you 10,
10,
ten one hundred ten.

1145
01:15:29.531 --> 01:15:31.790
So obviously the present value is less than five,

1146
01:15:32.150 --> 01:15:37.150
less than 200 but therefore 10 over something less than 200 is going to be more

1147
01:15:37.281 --> 01:15:40.850
than 5% okay?
So that's his intuitive proof,

1148
01:15:40.851 --> 01:15:45.851
which is the essence of the thing that if ever you have a coupon bond who's,

1149
01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:52.850
that's a premium bond,
then the current yield is always above the,

1150
01:15:52.851 --> 01:15:55.500
uh,
current yield is always above the interest rate.

1151
01:15:55.501 --> 01:16:00.080
So you can always advertise it as having a spectacular,
um,

1152
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:04.040
current yield,
when in fact,
it's just priced perfectly fairly.
Okay.

1153
01:16:04.041 --> 01:16:07.160
So I'm going to just continue the story of what's the right way to measure

1154
01:16:07.161 --> 01:16:11.060
things and how you can get confused by measuring the wrong way.
Next class.
