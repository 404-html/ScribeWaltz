Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Dams. All right. So I'm going to finish talking about overlapping generations today. I'm going to defer my plan to save social security till a couple of lectures from now. And I'm going to start to introduce uncertainty in this class. The exam will only cover the stuff up to basically the last problem set. So you can, um, uh, there are a few things about overlapping generations I might say today, which we'll clarify what you already know, but you don't have to know anything beyond the problem you turned in on Thursday on a, you're turning in today. So, so you I think are better informed now than you were yesterday. I think it's a big help to be doing the problems. So for those of you watching on screen at home, you know, do the problems. So the, uh, the, remember we had a situation where there were, there were generations, each of whom was rich when young and poor, when old that looked like that.

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       And uh, and it went on forever. That was the only difference from what we've had before. People's lives were shorter than the lifetime of the economy. And to be, to go to the extreme, the economy goes on forever, even though where people only live a two periods. And then there was land, one, one, one, one. So here's land, here's, uh, and then there's generous. Sorry. There's land. And then there's generation as I forgot the generation. Here's generation, zero generation, one generation to generation three. Dot, dot, dot, and time. This is time. And here's time, one time, two time, three time, four time, five, et cetera. Now this model I've been told is the hardest thing you do. The entire class, things are going to get much more complicated. But since they build up slowly, I think this model is the hardest thing that you have to do. The entire class. I realize it's a little bit confusing, but in the end, I don't think it's that complicated. And it, it, it, it reveals all of a subtlety of fishers thinking, not that Fisher understood about overlapping generations, but the, his ideas you can see here. So what are his ideas? You've got a complicated model in which you've got people trading apples when they're young, uh, against land. So the, to the objects in the economy, our land, which are supposed to think of the stock market.

Speaker 2:          00:02:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       Okay. So we've got land and we've got um, we've got land. Yes. And we've got apples.

Speaker 2:          00:02:36       So

Speaker 1:          00:02:38       now what's interesting is the land is going to constantly change hands. So the young here are going to buy the land, but when they get old, they're going to sell the land. So the land is constantly changing hands. It's not that one person buys it at the beginning and holds it forever. So fishers formula, remember, was that the price of any asset, what's it going to be equal to the, uh, discounted, discounted dividends.

Speaker 1:          00:03:09       And the logic seem to be at the time that the price, you know, if the person was going to buy the asset, they could take the money now or they could wait and get all the dividends in the future and they would compare, you know, what they would get out of the dividends in the future to what they have to give up today. But you see in this example, it's a little more complicated. Nobody's going to hold the land till and get all the dividends. Each person who buys the land knows that he's going to sell it long before the land of stock, you know, before, before getting all the dividends from the land. And yet the price of the land is still given by this formula. So we never used the fact in fishers argument that the same person had to hold the asset till the end. And so now we have a case in extreme case where people only hold the asset for one period. It's always turning over, turning over, turning over. But still the price of the asset is equal to the discounted dividends. So the secret to solving this problem according to Fisher is forget about the acid that makes it too complicated. Fisher's argument, again is take financial equilibrium and arch and write it on a different board versus argument is financial equilibrium

Speaker 1:          00:04:17       equity Librium okay, get rid of acids. Put dividends into endowment,

Speaker 3:          00:04:28       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:29       Into an Downlands.

Speaker 3:          00:04:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:32       And transform it into general, like Librium the very thing you solved in the first couple days of class. Okay. And then go backwards and figured out what the financial equilibrium is. So although it seemed very easy before, it's a little subtler this time, but it's the same principle. Who's endowment should you put the dividends into? The land is changing hands all the time. There's a new guy owning it, a new guy owning it every period. So who's endowments do we increase when we put the dividends of the land to the sones and dammit, you put it into the endowment of the guy who owned it first. So put dividends into endowments of original owners.

Speaker 1:          00:05:17       Okay. So this old person who has the right to the first apple, his own endowment of an apple, and also the right to the first dividend, but he actually has a right to all the dividends. So his endowment, the endowment of Mr Zero. Okay. It's going to be two, one, one, one, etc. Because he is his original apple plus he's got a, and he has this endowment of an apple cause you know everyone when they're old has an apple. He's also, because he's on the land before gotten the right to this first dividend or the apple that's too. And because he's the original owner of land, he owns all the future dividends streams of the land. Okay? So we can freak out about land after we've stuck the dividends into the right persons endowment. And now we just trade as if it's general equilibrium. We just looked for supply and demand and the present value prices, which are p one p two p three, it's Cetera.

Speaker 1:          00:06:13       Okay. And because it's symmetric, we know that this is going to equal one Pete. We can always make one of them be a one. Price can be one. So the present value prices are going to look like this. Okay. And the reason I can make this simplification is by symmetry. You know, everything, every generation is the same. So it's obvious that I'll be able to keep repeating the same argument over and over again. Okay. And so what do I have to, okay, so, so remember the land has disappeared here. Even though this generation is buying the land and selling the land in Fisher story, you don't have to pay attention to that. This guy bought the land and then he sold the land so he, you know, it was a fair trade. So he started, he'd started without an end without it. The fact that in between use the land to save, you can already do that in a general equilibrium.

Speaker 1:          00:07:07       You don't need to think about the land because the only reason this guy is buying the land is to use it for a means of saving, which is already in fishers equations. So to solve for equilibrium is then quite simple. We just, in every generation we look at, and remember I forgot to write the utility functions. So we have, you have consumption when young and old is one half log young plus one half log old. Okay. And so therefore INACA Librium we have to have that one half times the income of every generation. Every generation is going to have three one young plus one one old. Now from the point of view of any generation t the prices are Pete say too when young and p three when old. Now remember any generation cares only about relative prices. So I can call them p two or p three or I can call them one and p because the ratio is going to be p so much simpler to think of the prices as one in p.

Speaker 1:          00:08:07       So the old guy, okay, if I'm doing any tea like this period for the old guy here, you know that's p four and p three he cares about p three and p four but he only cares about the ratio of p three and p four which is p. So from his point of view, he might as well have thought of them as one in p. So his income is three plus one p and he's going to spend half his income on that good. Which for him as a relative price of p, the young guys gonna spend half his income, which is also three plus one p. This is the relative price between t minus one and t. This is the relative price between t and t plus one but he's now young. So his price when young is one and that has to equal three plus one plus one equals. So I wrote it as one plus three plus one equals five. Okay. And we solve that and we found that key equals 0.55 okay. So there are any questions about how we did that. That's where we ended the last lecture. Is that clear to everyone? Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:09:13       Okay. If I didn't have symmetry, I would have to say this is, I would have to write this as in general, this would be three p t minus one plus one PT over PT. And this guy would be three p t plus one p t plus one divided by P t. Right. That would be in general, if I had prices, the present value prices, this guy income would be given by that because he's the old at time t and the young would be given by that. Okay. And I'd have to do this a new equation for every t.

Speaker 2:          00:10:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:04       Who asked? You asked the question. Right? So does that make sense? Okay. But I have to do that for every single t. So I had an infinite number of prices and an infinite number of equations. But then you say right yourself, well, hmm, you in all this is if I, if I replace, if I take the ratio of PT over p t minus one to equal p, okay, then the ratio of these two prices are the same as this price. And so I've got, um, you know, I'll have it one equation and one unknown variable and that same equation will get repeated every other generation because when I go to generation, you know, s which is another generation, all that matters is the ratio between p t minus one in PT and PTT and p t p t plus one. So if I, if I, uh, assume every Genera, if I assume those ratios are always the same, I'm going to be repeating the same equation over and over again. So I can solve at once. I can solve an infinite number of times. It's basically the same equation written infinitely often. And so as long as I stick in heat, these ratios constant, I'm just doing it over and over again. So I only have to do at once. So that's the [inaudible]. So it doesn't have to work out that it's, you know that it's just because you know, every generation has the same endowments and every generation has the same utility. That's why it's such a simple thing to solve. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:11:30       Is it regular PE before you raised it? That becomes the old age consumption price because we assumed a young age price one

Speaker 1:          00:11:42       the p this p is just the ratio between, this is the, this is how I got p. P t p is p t over p t minus one which also equals PT plus one over p. T the ratio of all the prices is always pee. Okay. The ratio, but between time, t and time t plus one, this good is more valuable than that. Good. This good is only worth P P is 0.55 it's only worth 55% of this good. And then this good here is only worth 55% of that. Good. So the symmetry assumption, you know, but, but the symmetry of the problem suggest that I could guess that the prices are going to, the present value prices are going to decline by 50 by the same percentage every period.

Speaker 2:          00:12:36       So,

Speaker 1:          00:12:38       okay. So let me, any other questions? I mean we'll keep going with questions. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:12:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:46       Yeah. What is the endowment of the original old guy? He's the guy who owns the land. So what does he have? He has one apple when he's his endowment, when he's old, like everybody else who's old, he has an apple, you know, his own tree in his backyard. Uh, it gives them an apple when he's old. Okay. Or you know, when he's an old man or an old woman, he can sort of, you know, barely scrape together one apple. Now he also has the land. The land is his for all time. So the land is paying an apple every year forever. So his own apple, when he's, he, you know, at time one plus the land's apple is this too. And the land is produced as an apple every time in the future. So that's his endowment. I stuck the dividends of the land into his endowment.

Speaker 2:          00:13:37       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:13:38       right. I'm not assuming he lives forever. He doesn't. In fact he knows he's going to die in period one. He wants to do all this consuming in period one, but he hasn't. So that's another subtle thing about this. You can own endowments that you know occur after your dad. You know the, the, the, the, if you own a tree, the tree is going to be, the land is going to be producing stuff long after you're dead. So when you sell off the land, you're selling off those future dividends. Okay? Of course, you're not going to hold the land if you don't care about your children, you're not going to hold the land beyond the time you live because you want to just consume as much as you can. So you're going to sell off the land and consume, but you're selling off all of these future dividends. Okay? So another thing this model gives us is a new argument. Argument for the real interest rate real are being greater than zero. So why is it because from this formula,

Speaker 1:          00:14:39       gosh, I was so clever. Where did I, Oh, here for the price of the acids, this counter dividends, that's going to be one over one plus r plus one over one plus r squared, plus one over one plus r cubed, plus dot, dot, dot. By the way, that's equal to p plus p squared plus Pq. Do you notice? Okay, so the discounted value of the dividends is the price of land. So the price of land of course has to be finite, you know, because I mean it's, the old guy owned a thing worth an infinite amount of money. He'd sell it and he buy everything in the world. So if you're going to have equilibrium, you know, there's no plot of land that sells for 10 you know, for $100 trillion. The price of every plot of land to some finite amount. So if the land is producing, you know, I think it's sort of realistic.

Speaker 1:          00:15:29       Land is probably gonna produce forever. As long as the world last, if you've got land, you'll get something out of it. Someone will always want the land. And so if it's going to have a finite price, the whole future dividends have to be discounted to a finite number. If you put zero in here for are you get infinity. So this presence of land is forcing the discount rate above zero. Okay. So it's another argument the Fisher never would've thought of him cause he never thought about infinities or anything like that. Another argument for the interest rate. Real interest rate being positive. Okay. Any other questions about this? So we reduce it to one equation and I'll put back the p here in just one unknown.

Speaker 3:          00:16:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:23       Okay. Equals five. And we solve it and then get peak was 0.55. Okay. And it's a quadratic equation. So you can all solve a quadratic equations now in this. Oh, okay. What else do I want to say? So now you could analyze all sorts of things. You could do the same comparative statics Fisher does. So we changed the utility function and made this, you know, a third instead of a half that would correspond to doing what? Making people more, more what?

Speaker 1:          00:17:01       Impatient. Okay. And what would you think would happen to the interest rate? Go Up. Okay. So in the XL file we're going to do just that and we're going to see it's going to go up. Instead, we could, um, we could do the social security thing and we could have every young person give something to the previous old, which means everybody's endowment goes from say three to two and one to two. Okay. So they get more in the future and lesson early on. So again, you could resolve for equilibrium and Fisher saying if we've got worn down in the future and less than the present, you're going to have a higher, um, a higher, a real interest rates. You've got a higher real interest rate, you know, you could make the land more productive and change this to a two everywhere and see what happens. Okay, so in this XL file, I do that. Maybe I'll come back to that. So we're going to do those experiments in a second. Uh, but now I do, I want to do two, two more things before I end this. The first is, I want to say, suppose we had growth in the economy.

Speaker 1:          00:18:05       So what if you had growth? Where am I going to add growth over here? I shouldn't have erased that. So let's have growth. Okay, what happens?

Speaker 1:          00:18:20       Well, Tobin, you know, Yale's greatest economist after Irving Fisher, he said something which was 90% right, but not 100%, right? He said, you know, I pointed out to him that I got these guys at social security. I worked with them. And anyway, these people at Social Security and the social security administration calculated who were the biggest beneficiaries of social security and was Tobin's generation, the same generations, my father. And he said, look, it's your fault that social security is such a mess. You benefited and I'm going to have to pay for it. And He, you know, just like you're feeling, you're going to have to pay for it. Um, so it's even worse for you. But even my generation's not getting a very good deal. Yours is getting a terrible deal to opens, got a great deal. And so he said to me, it's not his fault, it's my fault because I didn't have enough children.

Speaker 1:          00:19:09       Okay. So the question is what happens if you, you know, what does that mean? So what Tobin meant is that if instead of having one child for every adult, okay, so every family has two children. In other words, instead of one fam child for every adult. So it goes three one, three, one, three, one we start doubling the size. You know, the generations are growing through time. So since this is 30 years or something, we can think of the generations doubling. That wouldn't be such a fast growth rate. And so Tobin would say, uh, you know, might've meant if you double the generations, you're going to have six and two is the endowment, you know, two guys at three and one which means six and two that you're going to have 12 and four. It's going to be a gigantic, uh, growth. And so each generation when it's old, the young guys only if they're six and two here now instead of, so I should use a different color if I wrote six and two here,

Speaker 3:          00:20:04       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:20:04       if I put six and two there, then each guy would have to, or two guys at three and one each three, one guy would only have to give up half. Uh, we don't, we have to give up

Speaker 1:          00:20:19       half of his down at half a unit because there'd be two of them, each giving half a unit to the old guy and each one when he gets old, getting a full unit. So this guy would get a full unit. The next generation would only give up half of unit because there were four times as many people in the next generation. Each of them would still give a half making these two old guys get their full one and when they got old, they'd similarly get a full one each of them. So it would seem that if he had a faster growing population than social security would be a much better deal because the young would have to give a bless to the old and still get fully paid back when they are old. And so social security wouldn't have been a problem. Okay. So why isn't that a totally, so why wasn't it our fault? My fault and your generation, there's probably not going to have any more children than my generation. So what's the, uh, is that true Tobin's argument? Is it true that if we just had enough children we could pay it? You know, no one would have to lose out and social security, we could make the original generation better off and also every other generation after that better off. Yup.

Speaker 2:          00:21:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:31       Right. Okay. Exactly. And so you can't know that until you actually solve a model. So the point is that if the generations keep growing like that, um, the interest rate is going to go up. And so it's still going to be a loss because although you're going to be trading off minus a half to get one as opposed to minus one to get one. So this looks like a much better scenario. You're going, once you get to this scenario, there's going to be a bigger interest rate. So remember the present value of that trade is minus one plus one over one plus r. That's why it's negative cause ours positive here, it's minus one minus a half plus one over one plus R. Okay. But that's a different are, that's an are, I'll put it at the top. That's an annuity economy, a growing economy. And that our is going to be a bigger are.

Speaker 1:          00:22:21       So you're going to, even though it's minus a half instead of one, this thing's going to be small and I'll see you still ended up losing money. Okay. But you'd never know that unless you solved it. And in fact it's still going to depend on a little delicate assumption. So I claim, so Tobin, by the way, never bothered to work this out. I claim that if you're going to be doubling the population like this, they're going to be a lot more people working on the land. And so the dividends of the land are probably going to grow at the same rate. So I would add a two here, you know, I'd make the dividends of the land also double if the population doubled. Okay, so the land dividends are going to grow. And so now you can see why the interest rate has to go up because the present value of the land still has to be a finite number. The present discounted value of the dividends and the dividends are growing than the interest rate had better be growing even faster if you're going to make that a finite number. So sure enough, when you solve it, you're going to get a higher interest rate. Okay. And so how would you solve it? Let's say the growth rate

Speaker 1:          00:23:31       equals one plus is g. So one plus g, you know the growth rate is g and so every generation has one plus g times bigger, the previous generation. So what would you can just change this equation very simply. What would you do?

Speaker 3:          00:23:48       Well,

Speaker 1:          00:23:50       for any generation, it's the same equation except that you've got one plus g times as many old guys as you have. Oh, he's a young guys. The number of young guys is one plus g times the number of old guys. So if it's generation tea, so this will be one plus at time t this would be one plus g to the t minus one. And this would get multiplied by one plus g to the T. Okay. And then the dividend five, the the, so everybody's endowment is also going up. So would be, well actually I screwed up. It would be um, the old guy one times one plus g to the t minus one plus the young guys times one plus g to the t plus the dividend times one plus g to the t or t minus one, whichever. Um, okay, so that's the new equation.

Speaker 1:          00:24:51       And then he can mult you can divide through by one plus g to the t minus one. So, right. So this is for equate, this is period teens market clearing equation. But you see I haven't. Okay. Because the number of old guys is, you know, for each one of them's behaving like that. But they're now this many of them and the young guys are behaving justice before, but there are this many of them, more of them. And then the endowments of the old have been grown that for, you know, the old generation has this many endowments. The young has this much endowments when young and then the land we also assumed grew. Okay. So you can just now divide through by one plus g to the t minus one and that goes away. And that just leaves that Matt goes away and that goes away and that goes away. So you'd have that equation all? No. Yes, he was afraid someone was going to do that. Okay. So let's just see where I got this equation from.

Speaker 1:          00:25:57       Okay. So I took my original equation, which didn't have any one plus cheese in it. And I just said if I had growth in the economy, it's no big deal to take that into account. I'm still going to have one equation so I can still solve it. It's just that it every time t how many old guys do I have? I have each old guy behaving the same way as before except that now you know there's been a growth of one plus g. This is a generation before this one. So this generation is of size one plus g to the t minus one. The young generation, which is one generation ahead has grown by a factor of one plus cheese. So there's one plus g to the t of these guys. So I take their old demand, you know, the same for each guy but different number of guys and the young generations demand.

Speaker 1:          00:26:43       And I have to set it equal to the supply, but that's just the old guys endowment. So one for each old guy and at that many old guys plus the young guys endowment, same as before. And there are that many of them. Plus, uh, the land which I've also assumed has been doubling one plus j is two. So the land is also jumbling, and I'm not sure whether I called this t or t minus one, but you, you know, either one, it's not going to make a big difference. Okay, so who asks the questions? Who followed that? Right. So now I just say I can simple, I've got one plus g's everywhere so I can cancel a lot of them out. That's all I did. So if I divide by one plus g to the t minus one, I just get rid of the one plus g to the tea. Mine is ones I change, one plus g t to the t divided by one plus g to the t minus one. That's just to the first power I got rid of this one. I made this to the first power in this to the first power. Okay? So I can solve that perfectly easily.

Speaker 1:          00:27:44       Okay. And I'll do that in excel in a second. So, and then we can see what happens to everybody's utility. So any questions about what I did here?

Speaker 3:          00:27:59       Yes. I know you said it doesn't matter.

Speaker 1:          00:28:04       Yeah, it's going to change the answer, but it's going to qualitative. We'd be the same. Well it depends whether when I do this, I want to say this is two, four, eight 16 or whether I want to call it one, two, four, eight 16. So I don't know which is the right thing to probably, I should have done one, two, four, eight probably the way I have it here, which is t minus one.

Speaker 3:          00:28:30       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:28:34       Okay. Any other questions about this? Okay, so the last thing to do is to um, there's do it numerically cause it's a pain to have to solve these, uh, you know, this quadratic things, it's only one equation but it's still a pain to solve. And I happen to have written a file that you can use to solve these all automatically. Well this doesn't look too good.

Speaker 3:          00:29:23       Good.

Speaker 1:          00:29:24       Okay. So the first one, the first case I did is I say suppose a, that's the exponent for how patient you are. It's half. Okay. That's the first exponent, you know, half, half. So I always can make the log utilities that two x the two coefficients. So it's a log. So I'm assuming utility here you have young and old is a log young plus be it a plus one minus say log old old consumption. Okay, so a I took to be a half, that's just what we were figuring out. I took the endowments when young to be three and one old to be one in the land output to be one forever. And then when you know, the price is what I'm going to try and solve for. And so I uh, you know, I solve the market clearing equation and squared it did the XL solver and I got the consumption, which we figured out was one, seven, seven, five, one young. And when old was

Speaker 1:          00:30:26       3.225 which adds up to the two of them add up to five together just as we thought. And so I even calculated the utility of each of the people. I didn't took log utility. Actually I wrote a monotonic transfers mation I put why to the a z to the one minus say it was easier for me to, you can get positive numbers. That's just a, that's e to the u. So I might as well describe utility as the exponent of you. Take e to it. So it's a positive number. When you do logs of small numbers, you get negative. So that's easier to look at. So that's the utility. Okay, now we can do social security. What happens with social security? The only effect of social security remembers the same model. You just take stuff away from the young and give it to the old.

Speaker 1:          00:31:14       So nothing changes except the youngs and diamond goes down to two and the olds endowment goes up to two and then the rest of the model is exactly the same. And so of course it's going to give you a different price. PA is different, so PA is smaller, that means today's price of next year's good is smaller. That must be more discounting. So I did the interest rate one over one, you know one over one plus r equals p. So the inverse of p is this thing. Okay? So if the Ford way does 161% and if you think of that as 30 to 30 years, that's an annualized 3.2% interest rate. Before it was only a 2% interest rate annualized, right? Remember we got the one one plus R to be 181% 1.81 so are, is there any 1% okay. So this social security doubled the interest rate from 81% to 161% huge increase in the interest rate. So social security has raised the interest rate and so, you know, you resolve the whole equilibrium and it had, you know, not it didn't crush everybody, but everybody's utility went down except for the very first generation. We know they, they, they won for free. Okay. But now I could do the same thing with, uh, with growth. Okay? I could just solve that equation on the left. And so I plug in now the growth rate from generation to generation plus growth. And here I've got

Speaker 3:          00:32:44       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:32:45       Two. Okay? So it doubles every period. Just the example I did. And so I solve it. And you see that of course when the generations growing and land is being more productive and they're more apples and stuff like that, there's just more for everybody to consume. It's actually made everybody better off. Okay. But now we see that Tobin and the interest rate is higher way higher. 247% instead of 161% okay? If I do. Now social security in the growing economy, every generation one young only has to give up half a uh, an apple and get oh, you know, and get a whole apple when old. So that raises the interest rate from 400 from, um, you know, 247% to 300% annualized from 4% to 4.7%. Okay? So, uh, it's, the rate of growth is faster now than the growth of the economy, right? This interest rate 247, 300% is faster than the rate of growth, which is 100%.

Speaker 1:          00:33:47       So again, everybody is going to lose. They're going to go from 3.06. There's still going to lose by social security to go down to three. But Tobin would, I would say is 90% right. Although more children doesn't solve the social security problem cause it's going to continue to, it's going to increase the rate of interest. So you're still going to have losers. Nonetheless. The loss is now much smaller with lots of children than it was before. So Tobin I would say is 90% right. If only every generation would have more children, we still would have had a crisis in social security. We still would have had, you know, this, every generation complaining it was getting a bad deal, but it would be a lot worse. It would be a lot less bad than it was before. Okay. So, um, and then I did this variant, depending on what we said, whether the growth was, whether I had a g to the t or a g to the t minus one there, it doesn't really change that much. Okay. So that's it. So you see just by a very simple modification of the problem you can resolve. You know, you can just, it's just the understanding is so much, at least in my mind, so much clearer now about what role growth pay plays. Having more children doesn't make the problem go away. It makes it better, but you can never make it grow away because the interest rate is always going to be higher than the rate of growth of the economy.

Speaker 3:          00:35:05       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:35:07       so let's do one last experiment on this stuff. Okay. Another problem to resolve. So this was a big, uh, I wrote a paper. Uh, the newspapers were saying the same sorts of things and I'll tell you what they were saying. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:35:35       oh no,

Speaker 2:          00:35:37       I d mistake. Sorry. Okay. So

Speaker 1:          00:35:50       remember those pictures that we showed before of the stock market, if you discount for it, if you take out inflation, the stock market seems to go when these waves where prices go up and then they come down and prices go up and they come down and prices go up and they come down. We've had five big waves of stock market's going up and coming down. We're now in a period where they've been coming down, you know, the stock market is lower now than it was 10 years ago, correcting for inflation, in fact even not correcting for inflation. So how, why would you expect that to happen? Is there any logic to that? So here's an old picture of the stock market. So this, I wrote this paper in 2005 so remember at the first class we had a picture like this. You can see the stock market going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down five waves. It's now come down further. This is like 2001 or two. So it's come down way further than that. Okay, so is there any explanation for why that would happen? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:36:48       so here's an explanation. I gave a paper, which a lot of people in the newspapers were giving. I said, the baby boomers, I said, you know, all these baby boomers like me, we're getting old. We're going to start selling our stocks. And so the stock market's going to go down. And so my account, so that's what newspapers were saying too. The difference is that the economists criticize the newspapers and me and they say, oh, you're crazy. They said the stock market, it can't be that the stock market is going to go down and everybody knows it's going to go down because if we knew it was going to go down in the future, it would have already gone down now. And uh, so okay, so you have to give an argument. So what I pointed out was that the, if you look at the history of live birth, you get the same cycle. Look at when up and down, up and down. I don't know if you can lead that. I can hardly read it myself. What years are the Pi's? It's so unreadable.

Speaker 1:          00:37:52       Let's just see if I blow it up a little bit, whether that, okay, now I can see it. Okay, so this is 91020304050 607080902000. So you can see these are live births. So birth, you know, there was a baby boom and then a plummet and another huge baby. Boom. That's the famous baby. Boom, my baby boom. And then a plummet and then there was another baby boom, you know, I forgot what they call it, the x generation or whatever it is, some other baby boom that happened. Basically my baby boomers, me having lots of, you know, having children, another big baby boom. And then birth rates are going to go down. So I think that you are the, you know, the number of 18 year olds in the country is, you know at its all high or it's going to be in two years when my four son tries to get into college and so there so and then it's going to go down again.

Speaker 1:          00:38:43       So this is a cyclical thing that keeps happening over and over again with baby booms and busts and everybody knows about the baby boom after the war. My generation, the 50s and 60s when I was born, everybody knows about that, but they don't realize that there's been baby boom after baby after baby boom and this is a cyclical phenomenon. And then the thing they really don't know is that it's exactly the same as the stock market that the stock market follow those five patterns in the stock market where the same patterns of the baby boom. Okay. So I'm going to end with that picture. So, um, okay, so a picture is worth a thousand words, but it's not that compelling an argument. You need a little bit of analytics. Suppose everybody knew that generations we're going to get bigger and then smaller and then bigger and then smaller with the stock market go up and then down and then up and then down as I was saying.

Speaker 1:          00:39:36       And it's all these newspaper columnists were saying or would it just stay the same as these, um, less imaginative, it kind of condoms, cra credit. You know, critiquers were saying that it couldn't have anything to do with demography because by rationality people would look forward and they'd anticipated going down and so they'd all cell before it went down. So it never go down and, okay, so that, so it turns out it does go up and down. Okay. And that argument the economist gave, it doesn't make any sense because they were implicitly assuming that the rate of interest stayed the same the whole time. And if the rate of interest doesn't stay the same, then there's no reason why the stock market has to stay the same. So let's go back to where we were before and changed the model a little

Speaker 3:          00:40:19       fit.

Speaker 1:          00:40:22       So let's suppose that the model is an alternation between big, between big generations and small generations. So let's suppose that you have six, two, three, one and six too. And I think I kept, that was a good question. What should I do with land? I think I kept it at one every period.

Speaker 3:          00:40:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:51       No, I hope that wasn't the key to the result. Okay. So in the paper of course I had, you know, people livings 80 years and I had their income, you know, reflecting the sort of trend in income over the lifetime. But I don't really, for the purposes of this class, let's say every generation there's a small generation work goals, you know, young three old one, then the next generation, which is just two guys. So they're both three one guys. So an aggregate, they're going to be six, two and the next generations three one the next generation six to the next generation is three one and it keeps alternating like that forever. Okay. Now how would you solve frack Librium does the whole thing gets just much complicated? I mean what happens after all? Are there any questions here about what we're doing? So it looks way more complicated, but it's not. It's a little bit more complicated, but not much. You can still solve for this. Okay, so I'm going to not spend too much time on this because it's, but I'm just going to show you what you would do. So what would you do? Well,

Speaker 1:          00:41:58       by symmetry I claim you can guess that they're going to be two prices a p. So you notice that every generation only cares about the relative price between one and two young and when it's old. So there's this relative price, that relative price between consumption of time one and time two that's going to affect the generation born at time one. It actually has no effect on any other generation. You know, these generations are born after that. So this interest rate, this relative price between these two periods affects only one generation. Okay? So, uh, this generation is affected by the interest rate between time two and time three. This generation has, is, is affected by the interest rate. But time three and time for every generation is responding to the interest rates during its life, not during another generation's life. So by symmetry, I think you could guess, and it turns out to be true that there's going to be a price relative price, I should call them small relative price between for the small generation and a relative price for the big generation. Okay. And that the same thing is going to happen. So this is going to be, this relative price will be pieced small, this'll be p big and then we'll get peace small again here and p big connecting these guys. And it's just going to keep repeating itself over and over again. And by symmetry you, you could guess that the equilibrium would look like that.

Speaker 1:          00:43:36       Is this making sense? It's not making sense. Is it making sense? So what would I have to check to see that there's echo Librium will any generate? So

Speaker 3:          00:43:46       mmm,

Speaker 1:          00:43:49       let's do a, let's do it over here. Let's do a small generation.

Speaker 3:          00:43:58       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:02       Oh, okay. So we never did the first. So the first generation, yeah, it depends on whether we start with a small one or a big one. But remember, if we can clear all the markets for all time except the first market, that one has to automatically clear. That's Fisher also. That was vol Ross's insight. Okay. So we know that if we can clear all of these, the first one's going to look very different, but it's going to clear anyway, so I don't really have to worry about it. Um, so we'll see why that works. Uh, so what are the generations, so I'm going to now talk about Martha clearing it anytime except the first one just more complicated. The first one seems really complicated because there's this guy zero who owns these dividends that go on forever, but of course they're just worth the price of land, which he's going to sell off. So Ben and we'll come back. Did that in a second. So in every generation, every time period, you're either going to have the w when small generation is young. Okay. What do you get? What's the, what's the market clearing equation going to be? Well, the small generation is going to be young, so that means the old generation has is big. Sorry. So there's a half year. So the big old guys, their endowment is going to be three, sorry, it's going to be six. There's two of them. So I can multiply, I can put the two out here. Three plus one

Speaker 2:          00:45:25       P big.

Speaker 1:          00:45:30       Okay. Divided by P big. That's the big old generation plus. And the young generation, there's just the old, they're the usual three plus one p divided by one.K has to equal. Now how many endowments do we have? We've got two old guys plus each owning one. So that's two times one. That's their endowment plus three. That's the young guys plus the land dividends. So that's six.

Speaker 1:          00:46:12       So this should be peace. Small, not PYP. Small. No, I don't because the old guys, the big generation is old. So small generation is young. So the young generation, they're after, they're consuming in their youth now. So they're looking at their endowment. The price when they're young is one, so they're young. Endowment is three, they're old endowment there. Their income is three times the price to them of one when they're young plus the endowment of one when they're old times p small divided by the price when they were young, which they're thinking of is one, right? They only care about the relative price between young and old and that relative prices is determined by p small. So I could call it p t and p t plus one, but I know that ratio is going to be p small. So really it only depends on the ratio. So I might as well just use the ratio piece. Small is this, this is a crucial idea that I've used a hundred times. So I think I've used it now, you know, three or four times. Anyway, so, but I think some of you don't quite know what the hell I'm talking about. So somebody asked me a question, if they don't know why this is right, whoever just asked it, maybe you still don't know why it's right. Who asked this question a minute ago?

Speaker 1:          00:47:19       Yes. Do you understand how I got this? Or you do okay. But when the old guys, so the old guys, which is the big generation, we're, we're clearing time. We're looking at this time. So the total endowment is three for the young generation. Their endowment is two and the one unit of land, that's where I got the total supply of six. So this generation, when it's young, they care about the p small, the relative price between here and here. And so they're there, they're looking at peace, small, the relative price of one to p small. The old generation at the same time is looking over their lifetime at the ratio of consumption here to here, which was given by P big. So they've got a p big here and they're consuming went old. So the dividing by P big. Okay. But now we've got a second equation, which is when the, when a big generation is young, so why don't you tell me what that equation is going to be? How much is the endowment when the big generation is young? So that's maybe clearing at this time. Here are the big generation is young. So what's the endowment

Speaker 1:          00:48:37       going to be? The young, so the old, there's only gonna be one old guy. They're going to be too young. Young guys each have endowment of three plus one unit of, so that's eight and you can see that adds up to six plus one plus one is eight.

Speaker 3:          00:48:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:57       Okay. And what's their demand? What's the demand for the two? So there's the old, what are the old going to be doing here? It's in this generation. We're doing the market clearing. Somebody knows how to answer this.

Speaker 3:          00:49:14       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:49:21       over here. The young, the small generation only has one when it's old. But big gentleman that's over here, we're clearing at this time period. So the a bunch of young guys and just a few old guys. So the endowments are six plus one plus one. The time is going that way. So that's why that's an eight over here. One. So one.

Speaker 3:          00:49:47       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:49:47       so this is the one old guys endowment, two young guys who have three each. That's endowment of six plus the land is once you get eight. That's how I got an eight over there. That's the supply. So what's the demand? Who's trying to buy the stuff? But what's the demand or the old guys?

Speaker 3:          00:50:07       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:50:08       so and that's going to be what they're planning to spend when they're old. Okay, we're doing this one there. So when the point of they make their plans, when they young, they anticipate what the prices are going to be. And so how much did they plan to spend when they're old? Three plus p.

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       What over what p pieces? Small. Exactly. Over the small plus. What are the young guys doing? We're over here. So two, there are two of them.

Speaker 1:          00:50:58       What's this? P what big divided by almost a half here. Yup. Over what one. Okay. Exactly. So that's it. So there are two equations in two unknowns, p big and p small and two equations. So to solve this whole model, you could get two equation. You could you, you, you just have to solve these two simultaneous equations, which I did. Okay. Now,

Speaker 3:          00:51:30       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:30       And then you can find the effect. So all of these old economy, the economists critiquers would say, well, P big should equal. Okay, what, what will be the price of land by the way? So what's the price of land going to be in the end? What's going to be the price of land according to Fisher at time? One at time one, let's say. So right here, what's the price of land? Remember it's the price after the dividend is paid. So what's the price of land? Let's do the present value of the discounted dividends. What would it be? Maybe I better write it over here. Remember the dividends are just one plus one, you know, one plus. So there's going to be one plus one plus one plus one, but I'm going to be discounting, but I'm going to be multiplying by something. So what is the price of land? P small incidentally equals I could always write that is one over one plus r small.

Speaker 3:          00:52:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:57       I could write p big as one over one plus r big. Okay. So what's the price of land going to be?

Speaker 3:          00:53:06       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:53:07       so it's the price of land starting here just after the dividend is paid. So it's very, you know, it's hard to think about this, but if you can figure this out then you've totally understood everything in the course because this is so much more kind and uses all the ideas. I'm just way more complicated way. Yes. Well start telling me the formula. So if I want to multiply four and I do the first terms, what is this first term? So you, you would put one plus our small here?

Speaker 2:          00:53:43       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:53:44       Okay. And now what would you put over here?

Speaker 2:          00:53:48       What

Speaker 1:          00:53:51       you'd put one plus our big here. Okay, very good. So now you guys really know what's going on and what would you put over here?

Speaker 1:          00:54:07       Okay, exactly. One plus our small times one plus r big times one plus r small. Hey, that's that one. I'm going to stop with that too. Too much. Okay. plus.dot, dot. Okay, so you have the idea now, what's the idea? Discounting between you're taking the present value of all the dividends. So this, this dividend, you have to discount it by one plus r a small. This one you have to discount it twice first to bring it back here. That's one plus our big. Then to bring it back here, that's another one puts our smallest one plus our big one plus our small, the third dividend. You discount first at the small discount, then at the big discount. Then at the small discount just like that. And You keep adding them. So why should the prices, what if you look at the price of land at time two? Is it the same number? Is that, is it the same formula?

Speaker 2:          00:55:09       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:55:09       it's not the same it. Well, because at time too, you're starting here and the first discount is p big. Okay. So it's going to be one over one plus r big plus, one over one plus r big times, one plus r small plus one over one plus r big times one plus r small times one plus r big plus. Dot, dot, dot. So this isn't the same as that. Okay? It would only be the same as that if our big was equal to our small. If piece small is equal to p o p big. So which one, which one do you think is a, the, which one do you think is bigger? You think pee small is equal to p big or one of them is bigger than the other. And why?

Speaker 1:          00:56:09       That's the answer to the critics puzzles. So you see, you've taken something that appeared in the newspapers. It sounds like common sense. If there are all these young youth, all these middle aged people like me bidding up the Pr, you know, there were so many of us who want to hold stocks with the peak of our earning power. We've got tremendous amounts of money. Um, we wanna, we wanna, you know, what are we going to do with it? Except put it into stocks. You'd think common sense that the price of stocks would have to go up. When we get old and we're selling all our stocks, you'd think the price of stocks would have to go down. Okay. So that would tell you that the interest rate was going to be bigger or smaller. So that would, okay. So that would, so that would suggest that the price at time one when they're with a small generation was young, would be low and the price at time two would be high.

Speaker 1:          00:57:00       Okay. And that could happen if this interest rate was low and this interest rate was high. Okay, but does that happen or does that happen? You can't know until you solve it in the model. You know the critique, the critics said all that can't be right because somehow you know, the price should even out and everybody will be looking ahead and buying or selling at the right time. You can't buy and sell at the right time because you're going to be dead. So you don't have much choice except when you're young here to save. And when you're old here to dis save. So you know, they, they seem not to have, I've overlooked that small problem. So anyway. Um, okay, so the point is that to know the answer, you can't just reasoned it out verbally. You have to write down a model, solve for the model and see what happens. And sure enough it happens. Like, okay. So we'll go back to the paper now. Well,

Speaker 3:          00:57:51       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:52       Okay. There are any questions about this.

Speaker 3:          00:57:55       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:58:30       Okay. So all I did in this spreadsheet is I wrote down those two equations. So you see that I've got the um, young and the old or have the same half half log utilities, the small generations, three one, the big generation is six to land is always producing one every period. And we get two different prices. The PA, the, the price is called Pa, that's the age generation, which is the small generation and the beat generation, which is the big generation. So you can see that PA is a very small number when the generation of small, and that means the discount rate is very high. So a high interest rate when the generation is small and a low interest rate when the generations are big. So when the, when the, when the, uh, in the moneymaking peak of the big generation, the real interest rate is small. And so that means you're not discounting very much.

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       And so the prices are high of land. And so sure enough, the price when the small generation is young is 1.29. And when the big generation is young, it's a 2.08 vastly higher. So it really is the case that as the generations rise and fall, the interest rates rise and fall and the price of land rises and falls and everybody's rational anticipating everything. Okay. So, so there really is, you know, it really could be, I'm not saying it's true, you know, cause it could be a coincidence that these things all matched up. But the fact is demography can have a big effect on economic equilibrium and the stock market. And you can be an economist and believe in demography. You don't have to be a Marxist or something to think demography and fertility and all that stuff. It's going to affect the economy and for a long time economic strike to wall itself off from other social sciences and say, oh, those fertility people and you know, all those touchy feely people, it's got nothing to do with the wheel markets. Well, if it has a lot to do with the real markets. Okay, so one last thing. Would you rather be in the small generation of the big generation?

Speaker 1:          01:00:28       Of course the answer is there, but tell me why.

Speaker 3:          01:00:33       Yup.

Speaker 1:          01:00:34       Okay. That's correct. So I'm screwed. And so why is that?

Speaker 3:          01:00:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:42       Well, it turned out to be the utility of the, um,

Speaker 3:          01:00:47       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:48       This is the utility of the big generation per person. You know, of course, adding the two people together, it's bigger. So per person was this a lot less than the generation of the s the utility of the small. So why did that happen? Why exactly is that happening?

Speaker 3:          01:01:04       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:01:04       so remember, I'm distinguishing sort of your peak. I'm calling young, your peak earning years and old. I'm calling the stuff when you're retired and not earning very much. So why is it that a high interest rate is good?

Speaker 3:          01:01:19       Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:01:26       Well, I think the, the point is if you're making money when you're young and you've got a high interest rate, that means a high return so you, you can make a big return through your life. Whereas my generation had a very low return, you know, the money, the return I'm getting now is terrible. It's negative. So, you know, the return I'm getting now is just hideous. But when, you know, when my parents were young, they were making an astronomical return. Incredible rates of return. Okay. So, and they were earning money, you know, in their younger years and, and investing it to save when they were old and they're getting incredibly high return. There's nothing to do with my money. There are so many people like me pouring money into the stock market, we're getting a very bad return. And that's why it's not so good to be part of a big generation.

Speaker 1:          01:02:10       So other people, it said the same thing. They said, big generations have to squeeze into the same houses. So there be less housing stock, you know, or we build more houses. The next generation along through all these houses built for them and they're less of them to, you know, so they get better houses and you know, everything's better when you're the small generation, you're screwed as the big generation. And here's an example of it. Okay? So that's it for social security. All the things I wanted to say about social security. Now the exam, as I say, we'll end with a, you know, you won't have to do the two generations and all that stuff on the exam, but the first part about solving for the 0.55 that one you might have to do something like that. But anyway, the lesson that you know, you can have a controversy in the newspapers with arguments on both sides.

Speaker 1:          01:02:55       You never can figure out the right answer to you write down a model. And a lot of that can be very simple. The kind of thing you could do as an undergraduate. That's the lesson I'm trying to communicate. All right, so from now on though, we have to change gears and I think the course gets a lot more interesting. Okay. But we needed all this background basics to have the logic of finance. But finance is really nothing without uncertainty. You know, if you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow, that's when the thing gets interesting. That's when you have to think harder. That's when people make mistakes. That's when a hedge fund can make a profit. That's when, you know, everything gets more exciting when there's uncertainty and we have to start adding uncertainty to are thinking about the world. So since they only have a few minutes, I'm going to spend the last few minutes just reminding you of what you're supposed to know about uncertainty.

Speaker 2:          01:03:48       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:03:49       Which is this slide. Okay. So it's not a very complicated thing. Where's the IC PowerPoint? Okay. So, so there are two kinds of uncertainty, one of which we're never going to get to. So the uncertainty that we're going to work with in this course is everybody understands what could possibly happen. So this was a brilliant, uh, you know, states of the world model it's called. So, uh, live nets is supposed to sees as states of the world right there live next was the one who first, uh, invented the idea of states of the world. He said, we live in the best of all possible worlds. So if you don't know what's going to happen in the future, we're going to represent that as many potential states of the world. Now there are other ways you could model uncertainty and philosophies. A big, you know, a big subject and epistemology and philosophy.

Speaker 1:          01:04:37       I'm going to stay hew closely to the states of the world thing. So if there's something about the world we don't know tomorrow, I'm not going to assume that it's just vague in our minds and you know, we can't quite make it out. I'm going assume you actually can make it out. It's just you don't know which of the possibilities are going to happen. So it's many states in the world. So a uh, example of that of course is spinning a dice or spinning to dice. So you don't know, you know, which of 36 possibilities is going to happen. Each of those would be one state of the world.

Speaker 2:          01:05:09       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:05:10       Okay. So we can, um, you know, so those are all the possible sums. So they're more states of the world and there are outcomes. Notice that you can get to through 12 is the sum of the dice, but there's still 36 possible states of the world. And so that random variable, the sum of the two dice is expressed as a function that says in every state of the world, what is the random variables value? So our state of the world, by that I mean something that's so detailed that it tells you the value of every random variable. So that's how I'm going to be thinking of uncertainty, that we're here today and a bunch of different things could happen tomorrow. And this is an exhaustive list of everything that can happen tomorrow. We're going to have to come back and criticize this assumption, but it, you know, introduces uncertainty in a way which is still quantifiable and not vague.

Speaker 1:          01:06:00       Okay? So you can talk about the histogram of outcomes of the dice. You know, how many ways, what chances are the chances of getting a seven, you know, six out of 36 et cetera. So this is stuff I'm sure you all know. Okay. Um, the most famous histogram in, uh, in all of mathematics is the normal distribution, which I don't have time to explain. And so a normal distribution or memorize this exponential thing, the, the dice example, you know, is a sort of, looks like it. In fact, if you had enough, you know, you had enough dice and you kept averaging their outcome, it wouldn't be normally distributed. So lots of things turn out to be normal. One of the properties of normal is that the tail gets small very quickly. Okay. And so, um, you're not going to get very many outliers. The normal distribution is a very common distribution.

Speaker 1:          01:06:52       There are lots of reasons why it should occur all the time. And so it, and it's also mathematically very easy to work with. And so economists for a long time assumed everything was normally distributed. But an implication, as I say, of normal distribution is that it's very unlikely something extreme is going to happen because this thing goes down exponentially fast to zero. So you're almost never going to see something way out here yet. We get these crashes fairly frequently. If ever, you know, 10 20 or 30 years or something. There's some gigantic outlier. So clearly things can't be normally distributed and that's called fat tails. Okay. The, and I'm sure you've heard about that and the newspaper, we're going to come back to that. Okay. Now there are a couple things that you need to, uh, no. So you can, you can represent the payoff of any random variable as a picture, you know, in every state what its, its payoff.

Speaker 1:          01:07:43       Okay. So a riskless random variable riskless investment will pay the same amount in every state. So I still have a few minutes here. Okay. Um, okay, so now two incredibly important concepts, which I'm sure you know, but I'm, or at least the mean, you know, just the average. What's the, what's the expected payoff? So the expected payoff is you multiply the outcome and every state by the probability of the state and you add it up. Okay, so there how many different ways? Uh, so if you have one dice, okay, you can figure out the expectation of one dice. It's equally likely to get one, two, three, four, five or six. And so if you add all those up, multiplied by six, you get three and a half. So the expectation of one dice is three and a half. The expectation of to die is therefore, okay, so, so that's okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:31       That's one dice, okay. Now the expectation of adding two dice together and of course going to be seven because the expectation of one dice is three and a half and the other guy says three and a half in there. And so the expectation of the psalm is the, some of the expectations. So it's seven. Okay? So you know that. Now, one more thing that you have to know is the variance. So how do you measure how uncertain you are about what's going to happen? Well, the simplest number to do, like with the dice is to say, okay, the expectation is three and a half. When we don't get three and a half, we're going to, it means there was some error. Expectation wasn't confirmed. So you could just measure the air as the distance between three and a half and what you actually got. So if you've got a four you could say you are off by a half the room, but it con but people don't do that.

Speaker 1:          01:09:17       They they'd measure the square of the distance. Okay. And they take the average square of the distance that's called the variance. Okay. So it would be, if you've got four, when you're expecting three and a half, the error is a half squared. So it's a, you take a six times a half squared plus the six times one and a half squared plus a six times two and a half squared. That's where the high mistakes and the low mistakes, you'd take a half times a half squared plus a half times one and a half squared plus a half times two and a half squared. Now, why do they use the expected squared error instead of just the expected error? Well, for this simple reason, she may not have thought of. If you had to guess, if you, if you look at as the error as the penalty for making a wrong guess and you were forced at the beginning to say what guests would you like to make for how the dice is going to turn out, how the dye is going to turn out.

Speaker 1:          01:10:06       And if you're wrong, w will penalize you by this measure of error. Well, if you're just taking the absolute error, your best guess would be any number between three and four. You could say three and a half. He could also say three and a quarter because if you said three and a quarter you'd meet, you'd become closer on all the low rolls of the dice and be a little further off on all the high roles and you'd get exactly the same error. So you could say any number between three and four. But if you make the s the error of the square of the mistake, your best guess is always to say the expectation. Three and a half is the only is the, is the, is the only thing you can say to minimize your expected penalty if the penalty is the squared error. So because of that, um, so that, that's connected to a mathematical thing and you know, in orthogonal vectors and all that because of that, uh, the error we talk about always is the squared error.

Speaker 1:          01:10:57       And so that's whenever we're measuring uncertainty, we're going to talk about the square to error, the average of the squared errors of the square root of that, which is called the standard deviation. Okay. I've one more minute to just finish this. So this is, I'm assuming you all, uh, no that okay. Or can learn that. Okay. One more thing. I'm going to assume, you know, the last thing is the covariance. What does it mean to say that random variables x and y move in the same direction? So this was quite a brilliant thought. So what it means is that to move in the same direction means if x surprises you by being above what you would have expected. So if the expectation of x as x bar, and the expectation of y is y bar, if you multiply the two and they're both higher than you expected, you'll get a positive number.

Speaker 1:          01:11:44       If they're both lower than expected, you'll also get a positive number. So by taking this some, the expected deviation from the expectation multiplied, you get a number, which when it's very positive, it means they're either both positive together, both negative together. So they're going in the same direction. If one of them is above the average while the other one's below the average, then you'll get a negative numbers. So big covariance means they move in the same direction, big negative covariance they move means they move in the negative direction. Okay? So I'm going to take it for granted, you know, vis, and we're going to take this up starting right after the exam, which was on Tuesday.
