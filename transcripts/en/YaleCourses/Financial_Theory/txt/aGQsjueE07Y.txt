Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay. But now I want to move to the next topic. Um, which is the topic called the capital asset pricing model. And it's in some points, the high point of the class. It's used to be the high point of a finance. Uh, the theory hasn't worked out as well as people thought, uh, in recent times, but it is quite a great achievement and a lot of it was done here at Yale. So I want to ex explain it to you. So you see we have a problem so far. If everybody's trying to hedge, that means everybody's trying to get a completely, you know, riskless payoff. It's impossible because I mean, there's real risk in the economy in s and so how and what do we mean by real risk? Well, something in one state is just going to be bad for the whole economy compared to another state.

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       Maybe we'll run out of oil or something like that. It's impossible that everybody can consume the same thing in every state. So it's impossible that everybody can perfectly hedge, but everybody wants to perfectly hedge. So what has to happen? What gives? How does the theory have to change? Well, the theory is going to change in a simple way, which Shakespeare himself already knew and already told us about. And the merchant of Venice, what's going to happen is everybody is going to try and hedge as must as they can by diversifying. But because there's some real risk in the economy, in some states, things will be, uh, in the aggregate, worse than they will be in other states. So what's the consequence of that? The consequence of that is if you're going to buy an asset that pays something that's riskless, you're going to pay the discounted expected return of the acid.

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       But if you're going to buy an asset that's risky, you're going to need a higher rate of return. So the price will be less than the expected discounted payoff. So Shakespeare member said exactly that. When the, uh, the play begins with Antonio, uh, looking melancholy, melancholy, uh, his entire interlocutor says Solario or somebody asks them, it's whether he's worried about his businesses. He says, no, I've got a different ship. Every ships on a different ocean. So I'm diversified. I'm not that worried. So Shakespeare knows about diversification and that's what everybody should do. But then when it comes time to pick the caskets to get to marry the beautiful Porsche, who by the way is not just beautiful, but she's rich. So they're looking for a prize, the the uh, but they sign a contract that whoever picks the wrong casket not only doesn't get Porsche, he can never marry anyone in the future.

Speaker 1:          00:02:35       So what's the purpose of that contract? It's to make it a very risky gamble. And so why did Shakespeare want to make it a risky gamble? So we can explain? He understands risk and return. So you remember the conversation where everybody says, well, I'm not going to pick this unless you know, it's only because she's so rich and so beautiful that I'm willing to do this. The return is so high that it's worth the risk to me. So Shakespeare already understood that things that are risky are going to have to be priced less than their expected return. So expected payoffs, so they expected return. That is the payoff per dollar put into it looks higher to compensate you for the rest. So Shakespeare almost had the whole story. What's missing from Shakespeare? Well, what is the definition of risk is missing from Shakespeare? And it will turn out that it's going to be a very surprising definition.

Speaker 1:          00:03:21       So the purpose of the model I'm going to explain is how do you measure risk and how should that affect the price of things and how does that affect all the analysis we've done so far? Okay, so that's the topic of the next couple of lectures. So the first person to confront this problem and propose a solution, a mathematical solution was the mathematician Bernoulli and his brother. So the Bernoulli's were famous mathematical family. Uh, and one of the brothers went off to St Petersburg where he ended up dying shortly afterwards, but he invented, uh, he, he noticed the following puzzle. Suppose I am, some of you have heard this. It's called the Saint Petersburg paired Pete Saint Petersburg paradox.

Speaker 1:          00:04:11       So suppose I offer you a bet. I say, ah, I'm going to flip a coin. And it keeps flipping the coin until it comes up. Tails. And I count how many coin flips I've had. I've counted until you get tails. And if that's end flips, you get two to the n dollars. So if you flip it one time and it comes up tails right away, which is probability a half, you get $2. If I flip it two times and it gets heads and then tails, okay? That's with probability a quarter you get, you flipped it twice, you get to to the two or $4. If I flip it three times and I get heads, heads, tails, the odds of that are half times a, half times a half, which is an eighth. But then you'll get two to the $3. Okay? So four plus eight plus, you know, one over two to the end times two to the n plus dot, dot, dot.

Speaker 1:          00:05:07       So Bernoulli the one who died, um, you know, told his brother Daniel about this and he said, well, you know, I've offered this bet to a bunch of people and I asked them, how much would they be willing to pay for this? Risky acid and I mean, what would you pay? What's, here's the numbers, how many dollars would you pay if I offered you this bed? I'm going to just keep fit. Whipping a flare. Fair coin. Count the number of flips until a tails and pay you to, to the end dollars. So this is the expectation, which obviously equals infinity. So according to what we said so far, you should pay infinite amount of dollars for it, but Bernoulli couldn't get anyone to offer him that much money. How much would you offer for this bag? I just want to hear some numbers. Dollar 50 okay. Anybody else have any

Speaker 1:          00:06:01       it's pretty conservative. I mean, that's almost ridiculous. In fact, you're guaranteed $2 no matter what happens, right? So you're paying a dollar 50 and you're going to get to for sure. So that's a pretty conservative number to say. Anybody a little more venturesome than that? You can't do worse than $2 in this bad. What? $4 $4. Okay. All right. So Bernoulli asked a bunch of people, and the average of what they say happens to have been $4. That's what they said on average. And so burdened only said, well, this is amazing. The expectation is infinite and they're only willing to pay me. I'm miserable. $4 for this. Now, the real reason might have been that they didn't believe Bernoulli was actually going to pay the money. And uh, you know, they give up their money and they weren't going to get anything back. But let's ignore that temporarily and take it seriously.

Speaker 1:          00:06:51       Bertolli said, the solution must be that people don't care about the dollar payoff. They care about the utility of the dollar payoff. So let's put in a utility function. So the utility of the dollar payoff would be, you have to, plus one porter, you will four plus one eighth. You have eight plus one over two to the end. You have two to the n plus. Dot, dot, dot. And so then he said, well, of course, why is that going to help? Well, because if the utility functions say looks like this, so here's x and here's you a Vax, the more dollars you get, maybe it increases utility, but by less and less. So you're not really gaining much by getting these numbers way out here. They're not adding really much to utility. So you only care about these small numbers. I mean, you know, it's good to have more, but not much better to have more. So he said, Lo and behold, if I put in log natural as my utility function, which this looks like that's the graph of log natural. Okay. And I put this in and now if you know a little bit of,

Speaker 1:          00:08:06       okay, now you see this is easy to solve to compute because log of two to the end is n times log of two. So the log of two's come out and it's just, the psalm is log of two times the Psalm, one over t times the sum of one of her two to the end, um, times. Uh, and so it's an over to, to the end. So it's the, so this is equal to log of uh, two times the song n equals one to infinity and over two to the end. Yeah, that's what it turns out. That this thing is

Speaker 2:          00:08:43       that,

Speaker 1:          00:08:45       okay, so it's not just one over two to the n which would have added up to one but an over to, to the end. So the point is, because you have the log function here, this actually equals a log of four. So anyway, I've worked out the arithmetic, it's very simple. You just have, you all know how to some one over two to the, and you probably don't know how to sum in over two to the end. You never thought of doing it before, but the same trick gets you to be able to some and over two to the end. It's obviously more than one or two to the end. In fact, it's equal to two. So this sum is equal to two and two times. Log of two is log of two squared, which is log of four. So by plugging in, instead of, instead of caring about the expectation, you care about the expected utility, you can explain why the average person was willing to pay $4.

Speaker 1:          00:09:31       Because the expected log in this is equal to the log of four. This is equal to the log of four. So Bernoulli thought he'd brilliantly explained his paradox. So this is the other brother, Daniel and the dot. The dead brother pose the problem and maybe solve the two for all I know, but the one who, the other brother who still live came up with the a solution maybe with his brother that it's uh, you know, people don't look at expected payoffs. They looked at expected utility of payoffs and the utility should have this con k feature that more and more payoff ads on the margin, less and less utility. So the, this is, so you know what, there's this function satisfies d squared util effects. The x squared is less than zero. Second derivative is negative. Okay? So the margin utilities declining as you get more and more.

Speaker 1:          00:10:23       So that was the first, um, the, that was the first advance on how to deal with risk. Now actually, Bernoulli didn't really solve the problem because, you know, just saying that you replace utility with the payoff with expected utility of a concave function, you know, this log wouldn't have really solved the problem because suppose that Bernoulli had offered instead a bet not have to to the end. But if to, to the, to, to the end, you know, much more generous bet. Okay. Then even with logs, you would've gotten an infinite number. So basically he should have said that you maximize that. People care about a concave function of payoff where the function is bounded, unlike log, which is not bounded. But anyway, let's leave that aside should be a concave function. Okay, so to put it another way, a concave function has the property. If you look at it, you know, let's say it looks like that, that if you have this path x a and this path xb and you've got, so this is the utility now here x say, and this is the utility, you have x Xb and this is the utility you have.

Speaker 1:          00:11:37       Say if you have a 50 50 bet of either getting x, say are getting XP, you're going to end up with this expected utility. Are Utilities going to be half of Uxa plus half of your XP? That's what we had down here. Half of this utility plus half of of that utilities. I mean nothing else can happen. Okay, but if you're giving the person half the amounts of money, for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:12:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:04       Then he gets this utility which is much bigger than that utility.

Speaker 1:          00:12:10       Okay. Because this is a kind k function. The extra you gain by winning the bet compared to getting the average for sure the extra you game doesn't drive the utility up very much cause it's flattening out. Whereas losing the bet, even though you're losing the same number of dollars, because from here to here as the same as from here to here, the loss of the same number of dollars is more important to you than the gain of an equal amount of dollars. And that's why you'd rather get the middle for sure, than having a 50 50 chance of going on the extremes. So Bernoulli pointed the way to the modern theory of risk aversion, which is to just assume risk aversion in modern economics means people care about expected utility. Okay. Maybe discounted, expected discounted utility expected this county utility where the utility is concave.

Speaker 2:          00:13:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:15       Okay. So whatever utility function we wrote in here, maybe it shouldn't be log should be something else. How would people evaluate this? They'd evaluate it. Log of four and other ones they'd say take whatever that constant utility was, which was log of four that produces the same utilities, the random gamble. So this random gamble is this expected utility, which is equivalent to having that for sure. So here's the four. Okay. So La, so for, for sure it gives it utility Laga for that puts you here, which is the same as the expected utility of getting the ramp them gamble. So that's what uh, okay. That's the modern theory of risk aversion and it explains why people would rather have things for sure. Okay. But it's now quantifiable because if you can't have something for sure, if you can't have something for sure, then you know that it's more dangerous.

Speaker 1:          00:14:16       But with this concrete utility function, you can find out exactly how much you're willing to pay to transform. You know, this risky gamble into a safe gamble. You'd give up this much expectation in order to get the payoff for sure. Okay. So we're going to turn into something into a, a vague theory into something quantifiable and get a surprising conclusion. Okay. So that's step one. We now think about people maximizing utility. Well, of course we thought about that from the beginning. The very first class you had utility and diminishing margin utility. So actually this risk aversion with diminishing march and utility, fortunately for us is exactly the same thing we've been thinking about. All along anyway, diminishing margin, utility for consumption. So the very assumption of diminishing margin utility that we made from the beginning is also explaining risk aversion. So it's incredibly fortunate that we don't actually have to change. And I have our mathematics and we've explained a new phenomenon. Okay? Now the, the most simple utility function it needs with a log one or the quadratic. So remember you have that

Speaker 3:          00:15:26       equals a plus bx minus x squared.

Speaker 1:          00:15:32       Okay? Now I'm on, you know, adding a constant is never going to change anything. Saw, he's going to write this

Speaker 3:          00:15:37       a x minus one half alpha x squared,

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       okay? That's going to be my, uh, utility function, my quadratic utility. It could be like this, or it could be like that. If he had a constant, you know, which doesn't depend on x, that's not changing what anybody does. So that's irrelevant. And if I divide it by a constant, like B, that's not going to change what everybody does. So I might as well as soon the quadratic utility is x minus one half Alpha, x squared, quadratic tilty. So that's about as simple as we can get when we're used to working with those kinds of utility functions. Now, why is that such a good convenient thing for us to use? It's because, let's suppose now that you've got this random payoff

Speaker 3:          00:16:24       where with probability gamma one, you're going to get an x one properly gamma two, you're going to get x to probability gamma s you're going to get gamma s yes.

Speaker 1:          00:16:34       Is what's the expected utility. The analog of renewing that means you is going to equal summation ass equals one to s oh yeah, Ma

Speaker 4:          00:16:45       s um,

Speaker 3:          00:16:49       x s minus one half alpha x s squared.

Speaker 1:          00:16:55       Okay, so that's all we're doing. We're just saying that people don't care about the payoffs. If they have to evaluate getting x one x two or x s they're going to take that and multiply the payoff by the expectation, but not look at the payoff itself. Look at the u, the utility of a payoff. Quadratic is very simple. And the reason why we're going to get such a beautiful theory out of it is because this number, you don't have to keep track of all the x's to express this utility. We're going to be able to summarize it incredibly simply. This is going to equal some function, right?

Speaker 3:          00:17:31       F of the expectation of x, okay? And the variance of x.

Speaker 1:          00:17:38       So all we're going to have to worry about is the expectation of acts and the variance of x and so many, many very complicated things we can think about very simply. So more generally, if you put the log instead of the

Speaker 3:          00:17:49       quadratic utility, we couldn't get this simplification. And so the theory would have to be more complicated. So the beautiful theory, the capital asset pricing model comes out of using this simple quadratic utility. So why does it get so simple verified? Well, if I just write it out, you is going to equal the summation of gamma s ex Sas. So this is s equals one to s. I've let my probabilities began. I don't know why I chose that. Minus one half Alpha summation ass equals one to ass of gamma s access. Weird. Okay, well here we have the expectation of x already. Now what is this one? Fl for gamma is excess squared. Well, if I wrote SAS minus the expectation of x, okay, nice. Some this squared, hey, that's equal, the variance of x, that's the deaf oops times gamma ass by definition is the variance. But if I wrote this out, what would I get? I get summation. S equals one s cam, s excess squared, okay? Which is what I have over there. And then I'd have, you know what I have minus two times summation, gamma s excess expectation of X. Okay? Plus summation s equals one s of gamma s expectation of x squared.

Speaker 3:          00:19:43       Okay, but what? Uh, what's this? The second term minus two times that the expectation of acts is a constant. So I can take that out. Minus two. Expectation of x can take this out and notice that summation gamma us access, that's the expectation of acts as well. So that's just minus two times the expectation of x squared. And this I can take the expectation of x squared out. My summation of the probabilities is one. So therefore I just get equal to summation. S equals one to ask Amma s s s squared minus expectation of x squared. So therefore this up here is equal to the expectation of X. Okay, so what have I got here? I've got this term, sorry, I've got the variance of x equals this summation, excess squared minus

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       expectation of x squared. So this term equals the variance of x plus expectation of x squared. So therefore I've got this minus one half Alpha expectation of x squared plus minus one half Alpha variance of X. Okay? That's what the, uh, that's what the Algebra gives me. So why is that again? Because the given quadratic utility up here, that thing getting old, you have in the quadratic utility up there, I can write it as this. And this term, this term is obviously the expectation of eggs, but this term is just the variance of X. Okay? Plus the expectation of x squared. So when I subtract it, I keep the expectation of x minus the expectation of x squared. That's the first term. And then I've got minus the variance of x from that term times the one Hass Alpha. Okay, so you see that depends on the expectation of x in a positive way. Assuming Alpha's a small number and in a negative way on the variance of x. So just as I said somewhere

Speaker 1:          00:22:01       I said it was going to turn out like that and it did right here, the utility is equal to the expectation of acts and the variance of x in a positive way on the expectation of acts and in a negative way and the variance. Okay, so now we're ready to start the analysis. We've, we've said, okay, so far we've assumed people only care about the expectation. And then we said, well, we know they don't really care about the expectations. Hedge funds and everybody else. If they know what they're doing and they're trying to keep their investors happy, they're going to hedge. We didn't say why they're going to hedge. We just asserted they like to hedge so their investors don't get mad at them. But really what we had in mind is the investors have some utility function. They don't like risk. So the, so the, the hedge fund is going to try and keep the payoffs steady, but there's a trade off.

Speaker 1:          00:22:51       You know, you can't eliminate all risk. So how much is the hedge fund and the investor going to suffer if all risk is eliminated? Now we have a way of quantifying it. People care about the utility and not about just the expected payoff. And so you add more risk to them. You replace a shore thing with a risky thing with the same expectation. They think it's worth that much worse. Okay. And so we've said that of all the myriad of utility functions, we could use log, you know, some exponential e to the minus eight x x to the, are there lots of different utilities we could use? We're going to deal with the quadratic because it has the simple property that in evaluating an entire risky proposition, people care about the expectation, which is what they cared about before. But they're punishing themselves for getting a bad variance.

Speaker 5:          00:23:44       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:23:45       Okay. So because that's such a simple thing to say, we're going to get a simple conclusion and a very surprising conclusion. Okay. So let's now analyze a problem and see what would happen. Okay. So the problem I'm going to choose to analyze is this one, I'm going to say that they're three things can happen in the economy. Oles with probability. Sorry. Uh, the first three. Anyway, those are the probabilities. Yeah. Okay. Now, there are many firms in the economy, a, B, and c, and let's say the first farm, I don't want to invent the numbers here, so I might as well just write down the ones I picked. The first one is going to be 50 or 175.

Speaker 5:          00:24:40       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:24:41       Hey, B, the other firm's going to be one 51 88 and three 65 and see, it's going to be 300, two 20 and 60. And I'm going to say, so those are the three things that can happen and the payoff of the three firms. And let's say there are two agents, ancient Alpha, uh, owns, uh, a and also 133.5 units of x Zero K and Beta owns B and C and I may have reversed these two guys. Uh, okay, in 66.5 units of that zero. Okay, so here we go. So by a Alpha and Beta, I mean there were a million Alpha agents in a million Beta agents and you know, they, you know, so everything can be scaled by a million because I want a bigger economy like we always have. Okay? So there we have it. We've got now a risky world. Things can happen to the, okay, so what are the utilities, let's say utility now of Alpha is going to equal. So I left out the main point. Utility of Alpha is going to equal a half x zero. I just made up these numbers by the way, they're not. So summation, uh, s equals one to three gamma s that's the gamma s up there times x, s minus one over 400 x s squared

Speaker 3:          00:26:32       the states. So there's ass one. So here are the states. This is state one as equals one s equals two and s equals three. Those are the three possible

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       states just like we had before with this payoff. And those are the payoff of all the assets.

Speaker 2:          00:26:53       Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:26:56       Alpha ohms from a which is producing that output in the three states and also owns 133.5 units of x zero. So over here, Alpha's owning 133.5 and Betas owning 65.5 at of consumption at time zero. So this is time zero. This is time one the end of the year. So by the end of the year, something is going to happen. There's a lot of uncertainty between now and then. Some of the firms are going to be paying off in some of the states and badly in other states and so on. Okay. And so the utility function for Alpha, so he cares about consumption at time zero and also in each of the three states. Okay. But now he's going to have these quadratic utilities. He's going to say to himself, um, I care about my consumption and whatever I'm going to cut. If I consumed, if I just hung on to my AA in state one, this would be okay if I, if I never traded, I just hung on to a, the utility function would be, you know, this uh,

Speaker 3:          00:28:04       quadratic thing of one 33.5, so it'll be um, one 33.5 minus one over 400, one 33.5 squared. Okay. Plus, um, he would end up with 50 minus a one over 400 times 50 squared times a quarter plus, you know, 100 minus one over 400, 100 squared times a quarter plus 75 minus one over 475 squared times a half. That would be as utility if he never traded. If you just stuck

Speaker 1:          00:28:52       to a, he, he eat his own consultant in endowment one 33.5 at time zero. Oh that isn't true. I wrote down the wrong utility at time zero. I said it's time zero utilities a half x zero. So it's a half one 33.5. Okay, so you get a half one 33.5 but in the future,

Speaker 2:          00:29:12       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:29:12       he'd get this and he'd get 50 in state one. Okay, so a hundred in state two and 75 and stage three. And that's the utility he ended up with. But that's not very good for him because he's running this gigantic risk. He's got this risk at time. You know, it's state one is a disaster for him if he just sticks to that. So he doesn't want to stick to that. So how should we evaluate the shares? Affirm a, how should you evaluate you and all the shares are from B when she could get, if he gave up some of a or how should evaluate the firm, you know, shares a see what should he do? Okay. So Beta has a similar utility. Betas, utility you Beta is going to equal one three quarters x zero plus the summation s equals one to three Ama s times x, s minus one over 800 x s squared.

Speaker 1:          00:30:23       Okay. So I've made these guys far from being impatient. They seem to, uh, they seem to prefer a consuming in the future till now. But, um, okay, that was poor choice of numbers. But lets you know the, these, this, this number should be bigger than one and this should be bigger than one. But anyway, uh, I, I put a half and three quarters. Okay. So there's impatience built in except it goes the wrong way. That was just poor choice of numbers. But the rest of it, oh, uh, you know, expresses their risk aversion. So Alpha is looking at the expected payoff of what, or he gets to consume in the future, but he's punishing himself by the variance. So you look at this formula all you see, it's not just the expectation, but he loses something because of the variance. And similarly, Beta, he's looking at consumption today. He's adding to that the expectation of his consumption tomorrow for his utility, but he's punishing himself for having variance in the future. So it's exactly what we formalize Shakespeare's idea of people not liking to be exposed to variants to uncertainty, which we've quantified by calling variants.

Speaker 1:          00:31:34       Okay. Is everyone with me now? Yes, go ahead. I'm glad you had a quick, I just made up those numbers though. That's the utility of Alpha and that's the utility of Beta. I could pick any people I wanted. I just picked those two people. Okay. Now what? How do they differ? Which person is more afraid of risk than the other?

Speaker 2:          00:31:54       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:31:55       Is Alpha or Beta more afraid of risk? Alpha is more afraid of risk, right? This one over 800 is smaller than one over 400 so Beta doesn't really care that much about risk. Oh cares. But you know, it's not going to punish himself too much by, by being exposed to risk. Alpha is not going to punish himself too much, but he's going to punish himself, you know, somewhat more. So Alpha is more risk averse. Alpha is more afraid of risk,

Speaker 2:          00:32:25       it seems.

Speaker 1:          00:32:32       Okay. So I've taken two agents who are afraid of risk ones more afraid than the other, and I've put them in an economy where they're risky things that could happen. And so we now have, we not want to work out a more sophisticated version of pricing and EVAC will Librium than we had before. So let me remind you that what we sort of have been supposing up until now is that the price, what would the price of a B, if we didn't think about risk aversion, you would so far what we would say, what would you say the price of a is price. Affirm a, hey, if we didn't, you know, if we were naive, you might say it's a quarter, by the way, I hope I haven't those probabilities. Right. I didn't, you know, it's like you'd say it's a quarter times 50 what's a quarter times a hundred

Speaker 5:          00:33:32       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:33       What's a halftime? 75 is that what you would have said? Up until now? Even up until now, we would have been more sophisticated than that. Discounted. Okay. Times discounted. Okay. That's what we've sort of figured up until now. That's the logical thing to do. Well, but we ignored risk aversion

Speaker 1:          00:34:00       and we ignored it at our peril because it's obviously important. I mean Shakespeare, a literary person, he understood already 400 years ago that risk aversion was important. And their facts that confirm what Shakespeare is. Intuition is the stock market historically has had a lot higher return than the bond market. You know, even though with the last stock market crash, of course it came back a lot, you know, average since 1926 the stock markets made something like 9% a year compared to two and a half percent and the bond market. So there's a huge disparity and after over such a long period of time, it can't just be, it was luckier every year after year after year, somehow people must have realized the stock market's riskier. And so as Shakespeare said, they wanted a higher return, meaning they were playing out a lower price, but how much lower, how can you figure out how much lower? So in this example, in other words, what is the price of a, so this is the wrong price of a apparently because it doesn't recognize risk aversion.

Speaker 1:          00:34:59       Okay, so what would, okay, so that's where we are. So everybody, any questions about what the question is? We're about to give an answer, but what do you see what the question is that our old methodology for figuring out prices, um, there's taking expectation and discounting obviously can't be right because it doesn't recognize risk aversion. On the other hand, we always had a utility function in there from the beginning, even a quadratic one. So all we have to do is do what we did before and put it in a quadratic utility and we'll probably get the right answer. Okay, so that's exactly what we're going to do. So Arrow in 1950, this is the same guy who proved with the brew the Predo efficiency of equilibrium. He was my thesis advisor. He said, you know, we can do the same trick that Fisher did, so only heat. For some reason he never credited Fisher. I could never quite figure that out. He had some obscure Danish guy he credited. But anyway, apply Fisher trick

Speaker 5:          00:36:03       trek and assume,

Speaker 1:          00:36:07       uh, from dividends.

Speaker 5:          00:36:12       Dividends

Speaker 1:          00:36:15       are part of a endowments.

Speaker 5:          00:36:23       Look

Speaker 1:          00:36:24       for g. E the general lack of Librium trading outputs, trading, you know, trading gourds. Okay. Then go back to find out, then go back to deduce value of firms.

Speaker 5:          00:36:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:48       Okay. Now what goods are we trading here? That was a conceptual advance. We call them Arrow.

Speaker 5:          00:36:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:57       And then the brew got involved to Aero De. So de Bruin was the gale assistant professor, while Arrow was a Stanford assistant professor. So Arrow Debreu state contingent commodities.

Speaker 1:          00:37:15       And so justice Fisher said an apple today and an apple next year, even though they're identical, apples are different commodities with different prices because they come at different places in time. In fact, most people would prefer the apple today to the apple next year. So Aero said, okay. On apple in the top state map, when the top state an apple in the top state is a different commodity for the same apple in the second state. Okay? So it should have a different price. So we've got to start conventional equilibrium according to Arrow, where as long as you have these Arrow state contingent commodities that you can trade trading today, you can bond. You can imagine today buying an apple if state one occurs, but not having to get the apple of state two or stage three occurs and that will have a price p one. And today you could imagine buying the apple of state two occurs a different price from the apple of state.

Speaker 1:          00:38:08       One occurs and also an apple of state three occurs, which obviously is going to be more expensive or it looks like it'll be more expensive than the other apples because it's 50% likely to happen. And those are the prices we have to look for. And that's going to solve our problem because the prices of the Arrow securities are going to be different maybe from the probabilities. And that's what will reflect the fact that when everybody's trying to hedge and not everybody can do it, you're going to have to change the tradeoffs. So we've already seen this in our gambling thing, at least the prices. Remember with our bookies, the bookies were effectively willing. Remember there were two outcomes, you know the Yankees win or the Phillies win. And if you paid, you know you could get the bookie. Who thought the odds were 60 40 by paying 60 cents today, the book, he was going to give you a dollar if the Yankees won are paying 40 cents today, the book you will give you a, you know, a dollar for the Phillies won.

Speaker 1:          00:39:05       So we've already had these aero contracts, these arrows securities implicitly in our equilibrium and those 60 40 odds, those were the opinions of the bookie, maybe not the actual probabilities. We said, you know those, the final betting odds, depending on what the other book is, we're willing to give it didn't have to correspond to reality. There might not be a reality. Even. So here there's a reality 25 25 50 but that doesn't mean that the odds, the prices that are going to quote it in the market will turn out to be that we have to solve for echo Librium and see what they are.

Speaker 5:          00:39:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:41       Okay, so what's going to happen while we can solve for echo Librium very easily. We've done this a million times before and I've chosen linear quadratic utility. He's the kind we did on the very first day of class because those are easiest to solve for equilibrium. You don't have to do get involved in the budget sat or anything complicated. You just set margin utility equal to price. So we know for Alpha, sorry, we know that the margin utility of Alpha at times zero divided by the price is zero is going to have to equal the margin utility of Alpha and each state as times the price ps, so the equilibrium, the Arrow to brew equilibrium.

Speaker 5:          00:40:33       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:40:34       Equilibrium is going to involve p Zero p one p two and p three the prices of the Arrow securities, the present value prices. P Zero is what you pay today to get the apple today. P One is what you pay today to get the apple a year from now in state one. So these are the present value. Present value. That's what Fisher would say. State contingent,

Speaker 5:          00:41:02       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:41:03       prices. The state contingent is what Arrow added. Now, you may ask whether there really are these arrows securities floating in the economy. And we're going to come back to that question, but you could imagine all these Arrow Debreu state contingent prices and commodities, and those would be the prices we'd solve for equilibrium. So we get this over this margin utility of that. Okay, so what is this and similarly for Beta marginal utility Beta at over

Speaker 3:          00:41:33       the prices, zero equals margin utility Beta s over the price of s. So what is this for Alpha? His marginal utility of consumption is a half. Okay. We might as well assume the price at one of the prices is one. Let's take this price to be one. Okay, so Beta her prices three quart, her margin Tillys three quarters in the price is one. What's his margin utility? It's in any state ass. It's Gamma s the Ama s times

Speaker 2:          00:42:13       times one. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:42:15       Minus one over 200 times x. S

Speaker 1:          00:42:20       so just differentiated this. I got one minus two over 400 times excess.

Speaker 3:          00:42:25       And what's her margin utility? It's gamma s and stayed s times one minus one over 400 times excess.

Speaker 5:          00:42:37       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:42:39       Okay. So I know an equilibrium that's going to imply

Speaker 2:          00:42:44       that one half.

Speaker 5:          00:42:50       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:42:52       Well, now I have to screw around here. So how am I going to, so I've got this thing right

Speaker 3:          00:42:57       over here. A half equals this thing over here. What over ps. Ah, glad that appeared. I was getting worried there. Thank you. Over a PS. Okay, that helps a lot. Uh, the whole thing. So that implies that something like x. So this is what Alpha is going to do and this is what Beta is going to do. So this implies acts Alpha s equals what?

Speaker 1:          00:43:29       So if I multiply through by 200 and I bring ps over, gam asked the other side and I do a bunch of stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:43:37       I'm going to guess this is 200 minus 100 a p s over gamma ass. How do you think that's going to play? Right?

Speaker 1:          00:43:47       Peoria. Let's see if I'm all the way through by ps. I get from all the flights through by ps over gamma ass. I got ps over GAM ass times a half. Then I multiply everything through by 200 so I get a hundred ps over gamma s and then I get the 200 here. So, and the excess goes to the other side and the ps over gas goes to the other side. So it's 200 minus 100 ps over gamma s and

Speaker 3:          00:44:12       one is going to be x. Beta s is going to equal, well, I'll have to do the same trick here except the only multiplying through by 400 and taking three quarters, which is 300 so it will be 300 minus.

Speaker 2:          00:44:30       MMM,

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:34       No, that was wrong. 400

Speaker 5:          00:44:37       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:39       Minus 300 over ps over here.

Speaker 5:          00:44:42       Damn man.

Speaker 1:          00:44:49       Okay. Because of my multiply through by 400 put ps over Ghana, us and the other side. I have three quarters ps over gamma as times 400 which is 300 ps over GAM. As this becomes a 400 and the ps GAM has went away. So I have that. Okay. So I know now if I could figure out what the prices are, I know what everybody would demand in every state. Okay, so not, okay. So let me pause here. That was the first critical step. So what did I do? I said, it's a long story. Lot of years went into this. I said, people are risk averse. Shakespeare knew that. We want to quantify it. So we say people of concave utility functions that quantifies risk aversion. We want to make a simple concave utility function. We pick quadratic, okay. But of course we don't know what quadratic, different people could have different quadratic utility functions.

Speaker 1:          00:45:40       Then we do the Fisher trick and say that any equilibrium, as long as you can buy and sell every contingent commodity in the future, cause the, all the arrows securities are there, it can always be reduced to general equilibrium just like we did before. And so now you have to feed the endowments into the agents and the payoff of the dividends into the agent's endowments. Okay? Um, but here, so we're going to, we haven't done that yet. And then we solve for supply equals demand. So all we have to do is we have to have

Speaker 3:          00:46:10       ex Alpha s plus X. Beta s has to equal in downwind of Alpha an s plus the endowment of Beta and ass. Okay? But this equals all right, so we'll have to do that for every s. So this is a 200 minus 100 ps over GAM s equals um,

Speaker 1:          00:46:39       okay, now I have to do it in state one. All right, so equals whatever they are. So what is endowment avast and down one of Alpha and ask Wilson, downwind Beta vets. We have to look at each state separately. And Lo and behold, I picked the numbers so that if you add these all together, you get 500 and here you get to 80 and two 20 is also 500 and here you get 500 again. So Lo and behold, there is no aggregate risk in the economy, although the individual stocks are risky, the aggregate is totally unrisky. So I could pull it. So matter what s is, I could put in 500 here. I'm going to turn out that the total endowment of both people, because I've plugged the dividends into their personal endowments, added up the two people. It's 500 so it means that ps over gamma s equals

Speaker 5:          00:47:37       what?

Speaker 1:          00:47:40       Which I have forgotten something for sure. One Oh, x Beta. Yeah, so that's Alpha.

Speaker 1:          00:47:51       Thank you. Glad 400 minus 300 p s over gamma as equals 500 okay, so if I add this up, I get 600 um, minus 400 p s over gamma acid equals 500 so then I flipped on the other side and I get Pete s over gamma s equals a corridors because 500 from here is 100 and put the 400 and the other side divide by it. I get ps over GAM. I asked equals a quarter for all tasks. Okay. So what did I find? I found that in this and so every, so it's the same ps over gamma s is the same. Okay. Same in all states. Okay. So what would the price of a be here? What's the price of a, an equilibrium? What's the price of a, I'm going to take the price of a shouldn't be price of a, shouldn't be p one times 50 plus p two times a hundred plus p three times 75 and what does that equal?

Speaker 5:          00:49:14       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:49:15       well p one is just a quarter times gamma one, right? P One over gamma one is a quarter, p two is a quarter times gamma two and p three is a quarter times gamma three so I just got this multiplied by a quarter. So in fact all I did is I did what I had always done. I took the expected payoff and discounted it. But discount rate is a quarter. What's the price of the riskless asset? Pi of one one one is just going to be a quarter because it's a quarter times gamble, one plus a quarter defense gamma tube. What's the core of times? Gamma three gamma one. Gamma two. Both Gamma three is one. So it's a quarter. So it implies the risk, less interest rate as what?

Speaker 1:          00:50:02       What's the risk plus interest rate? 300% okay. And that's why the disk, so we're discounting by one over record. Because the interest rate is 300% so basically nothing happened. We got all the prices exactly as we would compute them with expect with, without, you know, just doing expectations. We got the right discount rate. All we had to do was figure out the discount. Right? So risk hasn't played any role. And why didn't it play any role? Because although Alpha started off owning a alone, which exposed her, I forgot who was her and who was him. Let's say her exposed her to a lot of risk. She's not going to sit there stupidly just holding a, she's going to trade it for B and C for different shares. In fact, she's going to end up holding her consumption. This is her consumption. 200 minus 100 ps over gamma's. This number doesn't depend on s she's going to consume the same thing in every state by the and how can she do that? She can own equal shares of Ab and C, she'll own a share of the whole economy. So in other words, by diversifying, by diversifying,

Speaker 2:          00:51:07       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:08       Alpha and Beta each get rid of all risks.

Speaker 1:          00:51:17       So instead of calling it diversifying, I could call it hedging. The same thing. She doesn't just hold her a, she mixes BNC with it so that she gets a payoff of consumption. That's exactly the same in every state because ps over gas is independent of the state. She'll always consume the same thing. Everybody can hedge perfectly and there's no problem because there's no aggregate risks that anyone has to be stuck with and therefore the price is just going to be the same as the probabilities, you know, discounted. And that's the theory we've worked with so far. So so far you could say that everything we did was kosher. It's just that when we had these two different probabilities of things happening up or down, we thought that the aggregate economy would have the same endowments here as it did there. And therefore the probabilities we used, worthy, worthy, objective probabilities, discounted. No reason to change them because nobody's going to be forced not to hedge. Everybody will hedge [inaudible] there any questions about what I've said? I'm sure there should be a question cause I can't have said it as clearly as I ought to have. So with somebody like to

Speaker 1:          00:52:24       say something.

Speaker 2:          00:52:27       Yes. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:52:35       This is the new price with the one quarter. This is the correct new price. So the theory so far hasn't changed in any interesting way. We just found the discount rate. It just looks like expected utility. But you shouldn't have expected it to change because the aggregate endowment was 500 the constant in every state. Nobody, there's no reason why we can't have everybody perfectly hedged and consuming a constant in every state. And in fact that's what we did have everybody, she consumed the same thing in every state. He consumed the same thing in every state. No reason why they both couldn't hedge themselves perfectly and an equilibrium. That's exactly what they did.

Speaker 2:          00:53:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:13       Any other, yes.

Speaker 2:          00:53:19       Would you create?

Speaker 1:          00:53:23       Okay, so the next is going to be, what I'm going to do now is I'm going to assume that the endowment is don't add up to a constant and every state then what's going to happen. So this is not at all obvious how to solve this and what to do, but it's going to turn out to have a beautiful, simple answer. Shocking, not only simple, but also surprising. So any before I do that, I'm going to change the endowment. So they're not all a constant. Any questions about where we're going? Yup.

Speaker 2:          00:53:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:54       Yes. What I Prue okay, so thank you for the question. Okay, so I went a little quickly. I said that what we proved by solving for the general equilibrium is that the price in every state was just going to be a quarter times the probability. Okay? That's what we showed had to happen in, in equilibrium. Now what's the consequence of that? The consequences are twofold. Number one, the price of all the assets is the same expectation when I easily would have taken before where we use the discount rate a quarter. Okay, so that, and that's the first implication. The second implication is that from the formula for consumption, we noticed that she consumes the same amount in all three states because ps over gamma ass is a quarter in all three states for consumption. Is going to be the same in all three states and his consumption, which will be different from hers, but his will be the same in all three states as well.

Speaker 1:          00:54:49       The tool will add up to 500 so then I took a little bit of a leap and I interpreted that conclusion that her consumption doesn't depend on the state. What's the interpretation of that? She has obviously some are behind the scenes given up some of her Aa to get BNC and held them in a mixture, a so as to get the same consumption in every state. What must the mixture be? Obviously she held the same proportion of a, B, and c because those add up to 500500500 so she must have held the same proportion of a, B and c, a fraction of the market and got a riskless payoff. So she diversified. She didn't just stick with her a, she substituted a little bit of a, a little bit of being a little bit of see a different boat on every ocean and now she runs no risk at all. So she diversified. But in the language we use last time, I could call diversification hedging if I wanted to. She just sort of sold Arrow securities in the right proportions to turn her a into something that was completely riskless. Okay. So whether you call it diversifying or call it hedging, she's achieved the same end of totally balancing her consumption and everybody, he did the same thing and they both can do it because the aggregate consumption was a constant

Speaker 2:          00:56:02       yes.

Speaker 1:          00:56:06       In real life. Okay. The closest we've come to an Arrow, security in real life is a cds. And this is part of the reason why these economists, Larry Summers, my classmate and Ruben who you know, who was the secretary of the Treasury and Ran City Corp and who was a Yale law school student in the Harvard undergraduate and who I sat on many committees with, um, he, they were seduced by the, okay, so watts of CDs, a CDs pays a dollar if some, uh, bond defaults by a dollar. Okay. So that isn't an Arrow security, because an arrow security's a much more detailed thing. And Arrow security says, I'll pay a dollar. In state one, an Arrow security says you get an apple in state one, but stage one, remember, is not described by a single firm. State won the states of nature, our total descriptions of everything that could happen in the economy.

Speaker 1:          00:57:02       So an Arrow security really says, if it stopped snowing in Siberia, if, uh, the, you know, uh, Khomeini loses power in Iran. If, uh, there's a favorable election outcome and Afghanistan and uh, if, uh, Obama wins reelection, and if a, the u s solves the energy problem, then I'll give you a dollar. Okay. So the Arrow security list, incredible number of contingent things, every contingency possible and says, in that case, I'll give you a dollar. A CDs says, if this thing happens, I'll give you a dollar. Whether or not Obama wins election, whether or not America discovers a new source of energy, whether or not Afghanistan turns around, you know, just as long as the bond defaults, I'll give you a dollar. So the CDS is an event contingent. It's an event contingent, a lot of event, contingent security. That's the cds and an Arrow security.

Speaker 1:          00:57:57       It's a much more finely specified thing. It's a state contingent. He, you say everything that happens in the economy, so we'll never get to aero securities, but cds looks like we're on the way to them. And these guys blundered by thinking since CDs is, or on the way to aero securities, we should have as many cds as, and let people trade as much as them as we can. But we're going to get to that in the last lecture about how all that was, uh, you know how all this theory, what's wrong with all the theory, but, okay, so any other questions before we, okay, so let's, uh, let's now,

Speaker 5:          00:58:35       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:58:35       make the change that he suggested up there. Let's now change the economy just a little bit. Let's eliminate C. Okay. So, uh, so let's just disappears. So obviously now the total endowment is very contingent. It's 200. It's 280 and it's a, what is it? Four 40. Okay, so we now, now what do we do? So Beta owns B. Okay. So now what's that delivery I'm going to be, what do you think is going to happen? So we're going to see, we want to quantify this. We want to give a beautiful, simple theory that's quantifiable, but what do you anticipate happening to one p two and p three so everybody's going to say alpha. She's going to say, look, my a is risky. I don't want to hold my risky thing. I want to start hedging and trading these arrows securities. So I get the same constant in every state. Of course, Beta beat Beta, who owns B, he's going to do the same thing. So they're both going to be trying to trade Errol securities. What's going to happen

Speaker 2:          00:59:46       you think? Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:59:54       Yeah. There's no way that they can, exactly. There's no way that each of them can be perfectly hedged. So no matter what they do, they're going to be exposed to more risk and states, you know, state three is going to be a great state. State one is going to be a terrible state. So what do you think that means about the prices? So there's no way to head. Everybody can't be hedged. And so in fact, what'll happen is nobody will be hedged. Okay? Although Alpha will be who hates risk more than Beta will be closer to hedged, then Veda will be, um, so Beta, we'll end up bearing more of the risk than alpha. And what do you think will happen to the prices of the Arrow securities relative to the probabilities?

Speaker 2:          01:00:37       Yes,

Speaker 1:          01:00:39       there won't be a constant ratio of a quarter as we had before, but can you be more specific?

Speaker 1:          01:00:58       Exactly. So that's what's going to turn out because everybody though the world is short of commodities and state one, there just aren't many apples. That's the disaster. That's when we, we can't solve the energy crisis. We're totally screwed. Okay? People, everybody wants to consume more in that state. Everyone's going to try and hedge against that state. They're all going to be trying to buy Arrow securities in that state, which means that because there aren't as many divides and just not enough apolis to go around the price of Arrow Securities and state one is going to be high relative to state three where everybody's, you know, you, you know there's, there's plenty to go around there. So she is going to sell some of her Aa and get some B okay to diversify, but these got so good and state three that all of a sudden she's not going to be so worried about state three anymore, but state one she's still going to be worried about and there's nothing to be done about that.

Speaker 1:          01:01:51       So the price is going to have, have to be very expensive and state one. Okay, so all right, that's all blah, blah blah. Let's solve for equilibrium and see what happens. We can solve immediately. Nothing's changed. The utility functions are the same. None of this changed. Okay, so this board doesn't change at all. That's demand still depends on p zero p one p two and p three but now we have to be a little bit more careful and state one. So demand in every state is 600 minus 401 over gamma one equals endowment of Alpha plus a dominant Beta. So in state one I'm going to now change this to a one, although it's my handwriting, it looked like a one anyway. What's the aggregate endowment in State One? Yeah, I agree. Getting downwind and state one is a hunt. It's 200 this is a one now. Okay, let's 200 okay, so that means p one over gamma one equals one right? Because 400 and 400 so let's one so you're not discounting the first state at all. You're looking at the probability of it. But what if I go to p two over gamma to the demand is going to be the same. It's the price that's going to change to make up for the fact that the supply is much different. Namely maybe we want to 80

Speaker 2:          01:03:16       yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:03:16       Okay. So now if I subtract, I get 400 to 80 minus, that is three 20 divided by 400 which looks like four fifths, maybe two three 20 over 400 okay. It's four fifths. Okay. And if I go to right, because three 20 divided by 404 fifths. So peach over gamma twos for fifth, they're not proportional anymore. And then p three over a gamma three.

Speaker 2:          01:03:48       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:03:48       Okay. Equals now the outcome is um, four 40 so if I subtract four 40 from this, I get one 60 divided by 400

Speaker 2:          01:04:04       what's that?

Speaker 1:          01:04:06       Two fifths. Thank you. P three p three over gamma three equals two fifth. Okay, so a prices turned out to be quite different. Now the reason why they're slightly higher on average, of course, and they were before is because there's less consumption in the future. We suddenly made our future much worse off. So people are more desperate to consume in the future. So that means the price is a future consumption. I'm going to be higher. So we have two effects here. These prices instead of being a quarter everywhere are higher, much higher than a quarter because the future will look so much worse. The interest rate is going to go up. It's going to go down. It's not going to be 300% anymore. But more interesting is that the prices are no longer proportional to the probabilities. Justice, he said over there, the price in state one is going to be much higher relative to the probability, namely 100% of it. Then the price and state three which is only 40% of it. Okay, so that's the conclusion. So now what do we do for our price? What's the price of a, what's the price of a,

Speaker 3:          01:05:19       what do I plug in here? That, okay, so that equals one quarter times 50 plus four fifths times a quarter, four fifths times a quarter, four fifths times a quarter or one fifth times a hundred plus p three was a two fifths times a half plus one fifth time 75 hey would equal something 2035 and 12 and a half. 47 and a half. Why did I what? Okay. So what is p won? He won is equal to gamma one. Gamma one is a quarter. So that's how I got a quarter here. So that's, that's one times a corner. Hey, P two was to fit was three fifths. Now what was p two maybe I did it wrong anyway. He too was for fifth times a quarter times the corner. Hey, which is equal to one fifth and p three was two fifths times a half.

Speaker 2:          01:06:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:36       Okay. Which is equal to one fifth. So that's how I got the prices. Okay, so all right. So you see that things change and we've captured the idea that people can't hedge fully by making the price of the oral security in the state where the economy's worse off, much smaller than it was

Speaker 3:          01:06:53       before I go much higher than it was relative to the probability then before. Okay. So, so we haven't gotten close to the punch line. Sorry, I got, okay. So we're about, yes,

Speaker 2:          01:07:09       we're much more than you.

Speaker 1:          01:07:11       Okay. So the prices, the two things happen to the prices compared to before. One is that we no longer have, the price is proportional to the probabilities right there. The proportion is one, four fifths, two fists instead of the same constant, a quarter everywhere. And that's because the relative scarcity people are much more worried about the first state, then the fourth state. And that's why relative to the probability, the prices much higher than the third state.

Speaker 2:          01:07:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:37       You Fall, you agree with that, right?

Speaker 2:          01:07:39       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:07:40       Okay. But there's a second effect, which is that all these numbers, one four fifths and two FIS, they're bigger than the quarter, quarter quarter we had before. But that's obvious. That's cause we wiped out the future, you know, the half the endowment in the future disappeared. So naturally people are willing to pay more for the future because they're poor there. That's what we do. In the first day of class, we said that the interest rate or the third week, the interest rate according to Fisher would go down if you've got poor in the future. Okay. So that's part of the reason that's happened. By the way. What is the riskless rate of interest? So p one plus p Plus p three equals now it's equal to um, a quarter plus a fifth was a fifth, so a quarter plus a fifth plus a fifth. These are the prices a quarter plus a fifth plus a fifth and that's equal to,

Speaker 2:          01:08:32       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:08:32       2010, 14 over 20 okay, so that's five over seven over 10 so therefore the interest rate one plus r equals 10 over seven so r equals three seven. Okay. Which is like 40% okay, so the interest rate went from 300% to 40% but that's because we lost all this future consumption, but that's not what I'm concentrating on. Fisher would have already known that. What I'm concentrating on is the fact that the prices are no longer proportional to the probabilities. You, you're discounting every probability, but adjusting the probability because people are much more worried about the first date. Then the third stage.

Speaker 2:          01:09:13       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:09:15       not a, they're more worried about the first state at the pain. The firms are a and B. The states are one, two and three. So they're much more worried about the first state where the payoff is 200 than they are about the third state with a payoff. Total dividends in the economy or four 40 you with me?

Speaker 1:          01:09:37       Oh boy. That sounded so unconvincing. So let me just say like, I want to say the punch line. So I've got three more minutes to go there to punch lines, which are okay. I haven't gotten to the stunning conclusion so far. I've said stuff which is um, you know, which Arrow and debris had already figured out. But now I want to go to the thing that Tobin and Marco, it's figured out okay. Which is one more step we haven't noticed yet. Arrow has already figured out that because not everybody could hedge. That means that the, the, the price of an Arrow security is not exactly equal to the probability. It's relatively high if the economy's poor, like in state one and relatively lower. If the economy's rich like in state three. Okay, that's common sense. Now, what's not common sense is the extraordinary conclusion I'm about to show you.

Speaker 1:          01:10:24       Let's look at what the consumption is, the final consumption of this. Um, these two people, okay. So if we look at the final consumption of these two people, what's her final consumption? So x a, okay. In the three states, it's 200 minus 100 times one. Okay. Which is a hundred. What is it? In the second state? It's, it's 200 minus 100 times. What was ps over times four fifths. Okay. Which is a help one 60 maybe. Okay. In the last it was 200 minus 100 times, um, two fifths. Okay. Two fifths is 20. So this is one 80 say that's hers. And his consumption in the future, I'll put a twill, I haven't talked about x. Zero yet. Is, is a 400 minus 300 times one. Okay. Which equals 100 and here it's 400 minus 300 times four fifths, okay? Which is equal to help four fifths of 300 160. Okay. And here it's 400 minus six no, 400 minus 300 times to fifth, which is equal to m one 22 to 80 is this right? Hundred hundred 60 who told me it was 160 yes. And what's that? Two fifths is one 20 this is two 80

Speaker 2:          01:12:13       what?

Speaker 1:          01:12:17       Which mistake is there? Here?

Speaker 2:          01:12:20       Second one.

Speaker 1:          01:12:23       Which is this the wrong one here? Ford 200 minus 80 is one 20 thank you. Okay, so these are all right now.

Speaker 2:          01:12:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:12:37       One 80 you should be. Okay. This is, this is 40 so this should be one 60 thank you. That's it. Okay, great. Okay, so now what's so shocking about those numbers that I finally got them right. Thank you. What's shocking is, uh, this consumption is just the sum of the aggregate endowment. What's the aggregate and downwind whenever the aggregate endowment is just one is just a 200 to 80 and four 40 so let's say you take a quarter of this. Okay? So the differences, let's take a quarter of that. That's 50 70 okay, that's 50 70 and one 10 okay, so a quarter of this plus, if you add to that one 50, you're going to get all these numbers. So this person, Alpha a I claim just holds 150 of the riskless bond, pays 150 150 plus 50 7,110 that's a no, is this the right? Uh,

Speaker 2:          01:13:50       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:13:51       Just that's just check the number. Sorry. Only one more second. I should have. Okay, so a hundred 120 and one 60, that's the right number. And that's equal to 50 50 of the bond plus, um, a quarter of this thing. So 50 50 is okay, quarter. This is 50 70 and one 10, right? So if you hold 50 of the bond plus a quarter of this, you get 150 of the bond plus 70 is 100 2050 of the bond plus one 10 is one 60 and this guy's going to hold three quarters of the aggregate endowment, three quarters of the aggregate endowment plus minus 50 the bond. So three quarters of a, of the aggregate endowment, three quarters of this thing, three quarters of the aggregate endowment is one 50 minus 50 is a hundred. Three quarters of this is to 10 minus 50 is one 63 quarters of that is three 30 minus 50 is to 80. So what they've done in ACC Librium is everybody, despite having a million stocks to choose from and thousands of states and all that stuff, what everybody does is hold the restless bond, puts money in the bank and holds the whole stock market. So the first day, and we're going to improve next time, it's called the mutual fund theorem,

Speaker 1:          01:15:12       which is that everybody diversifies.

Speaker 5:          01:15:15       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:15:15       Every body diversifies.

Speaker 5:          01:15:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:15:20       Hey, by holding, by holding, uh, uh, the, the aggregate economy, all stocks in the same proportion plus money in bank.

Speaker 5:          01:15:35       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:15:36       Okay. So that fear of Shakespeare of diversifying, what did it amount to do? We have a very concrete thing. You hold 10% this person's holding 50 25% of every stock in the whole economy, plus a lendings putting some money, $50 in the bank. The other person is doing three quarters of every stock in the whole economy plus lending the money to the first person. So that's the first of the two amazing results. And I'll like, I'll start next time by explaining it. Okay. So you're going to see, it's going to be very concrete.
