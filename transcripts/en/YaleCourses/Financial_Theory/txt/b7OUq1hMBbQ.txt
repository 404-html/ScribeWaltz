Speaker 1:          00:00:01       So we have begun by talking about general equilibrium. And uh, this was the background to the course so that you're all familiar. Those of you who haven't taken freshman economics or intermediate economics, what's the background that's required for the course and the, the fact that general equilibrium is a part of finances. As I say, a bit of an innovation because most finance courses are taught entirely independently of economic theory. But the two greatest Yale economist and two greatest Yale financial economists have had financing economics integrated. And I believe that's the only right way of looking at the problem. And as I said at the very beginning, I think the events of the last few years have confirmed that view. So let's take up the question today of why is the free market supposedly so good? So we worked out two examples last time. The first example was, and the two examples are very similar to the first problem set that you did.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       Uh, in the first example, you've got two agents, a and B. And whenever we write agency and B, we really mean a million agents, just like a in a million agents. Just like be the heart of perfect competition and the economies that there's lots of people and so we can't, yeah, I think it's all right from now, from now on. And I'm going to be in the glass. So from, so the, so we meet a million people of type A and a million people have type B. So the utility function of a, the welfare function of age written there and the welfare function of bees written and each begin with endowments. Uh, so when these 2 million people come together, they're going to be doing the same thing that you saw in the class. And the first day they're going to be trying. There can be haggling and arguing and the, the buyers are gonna always say, the stuff's not worth very much and why should they pay so much?

Speaker 1:          00:01:51       And the sellers are going to say it's worth a tremendous amount and they should pay even more. And eventually they're going to come to prices. And we discovered last time that the way of describing what prices and what final allocations, they come to us by writing down a system of equations. And you did that all in your homework. And we came up with this outcome. So similarly, we did another problem in the last class and we wrote down, uh, you know, different welfare functions or utility functions and different endowments. And again, we've got the equilibrium. So he said that one of the amazing things is that the system of equations, the six equations for each economy that you solved in class always have a solution. So the, the, the people who discovered that discovered it at the Coles Foundation, they were Ken Arrow. Um, Gerard Debreu was a yellow system professor, Ken Arrow, who's visiting the cold foundation in Chicago, but it was a Stanford professor and, and, uh, Lionel Mckenzie, who actually taught at Rochester the economic equations always have a solution. So what's so good about that economic solution, Adam Smith, about the invisible hand, but you know, there was no mathematics in an Adam Smith. So why do we think equilibrium is such a good thing after all, you saw in the example that there were three pairs of people who for Lauren Lee couldn't trade it all. So clearly not everybody gets to trade. Discrimination happens. Some people get the stuff, other people don't get the stuff. Well, the first approach of economists, uh, was that equilibrium maximizes the sum of utilities.

Speaker 1:          00:03:34       So let's see how that works in, in this example. So this example is very special because everybody thinks that the good why has constant margin utility of one. So that's going to play a big role in our optimization in maximizing the sum of utilities. So if you want to maximize the sum of utilities, you want to maximize the sell. If utilities, you have to maximize, um, a hundred x, say minus one half x squared plus 30 X v minus one half x v Square, uh, squared.

Speaker 2:          00:04:21       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:22       Okay. Uh, plus, let's put it at the end. Why a plus? Why B? Hey, such that,

Speaker 2:          00:04:32       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:04:33       x plus x B equals 84, which is the sum of four and 80. And why a plus? Why B equals 6,000? So the claim is that if all these 2 million people meeting their meet in a room like this and start shouting at each other and trading and offering deals and stuff, it's going to come down to a final allocation which we've written over. There were a gets 77 of the first good and B get seven of the first good, and that final allocation is going to maximize the sum of utilities. So why should that be the case? In fact, in this example, it is the case. Well, why is it the case? Because there's constant margin utility of y. So we don't have to worry about the why allocation at all. Because if you increase why AA and decreased, why be they still have to add up to 6,000 you're going to be lowering A's utility and raising bees utility by the same amount. So you won't have changed the sum of utilities. So the whys are totally irrelevant to this maximizing the sum of utilities. So all you have to do is make sure that the x allocation maximize the sum of utilities for the good acts.

Speaker 2:          00:05:44       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:05:44       So that you can see must be the case because we can, we have to maximize the sum of two people's utilities are 2 million utilities. You can always plug in. X B is a function of x, a name we 84 so let's write it as a function of x day.

Speaker 3:          00:06:06       Okay? And we can replace this maximization by replay by, by recognizing that Xb is just a function of x. Say okay. In fact, it's a very special function where the derivative effect

Speaker 1:          00:06:18       speed with respect to x say so let's call the function, we'll call it that to denote that it's a function happens in equal minus one.

Speaker 3:          00:06:27       Okay? So we want to maximize this over x. Say taking into account that Xb is just a function of Axa. Cause if we can't get to maximize, you have to keep feasible. So we've now ignored all the constraints. Constraints have now disappeared. Provided we keep track of the fact that Xb is a function of x. Say, okay, so why is it the case that the equilibrium 77 and seven maximizes this? Well the, the key is right

Speaker 1:          00:07:00       finishing margin utility. We know that the utility function for uh, here's x utility function for a, you know, is quadratic. So it looks something like that. Okay. And the utility function for B also looks something like that. And so if you look at this function entirely as a function of a, it's also going to look like that. Okay? So by diminishing margin, utility, mushing, marginal utility,

Speaker 4:          00:07:36       the function,

Speaker 1:          00:07:39       the sum of utilities,

Speaker 4:          00:07:43       slum of utilities is concave

Speaker 1:          00:07:50       cave. Remember as a picture like that. So what is the essence of a picture like that? It means that setting derivative equal to zero,

Speaker 2:          00:07:59       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:08:00       You can to zero is equivalent to implies you, you are at Max.

Speaker 2:          00:08:06       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:08:09       well that's not true of any function. You know, if you have a function like that and then it goes up like that

Speaker 3:          00:08:14       can have the derivative zero here and not really be at the Max, but because there's diminishing margin utility more and more of x, there's less and less good. So it turns down. So all you have to do is figure out that the derivative is zero, which it is at this point. And then you know you're at the maximum,

Speaker 2:          00:08:30       but that

Speaker 3:          00:08:32       at x equals 77 has to be the case because if you plug in x equals 77 and you take the derivative of all this with respect x a,

Speaker 1:          00:08:45       this whole fang taking into account as before that XP is a function of x. Say you just get a hundred minus x say

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       clause. Okay, now it's just going to be 30 minus xb times the derivative of XP with respect to x. Say

Speaker 3:          00:09:10       why is that? Because you know the chain rule, if I differentiate, everything goes back deck. Say NXP is a function of x, age 30 cause I'm taking the door with a to XP, so it's 30 times the drew of XP with respect to x. Say, okay, minus the river was right to XP is XP times a drove XP with respect to x? Say

Speaker 1:          00:09:30       that, but if you plug in x equals 77 NXB equals seven DXA DXB Dxa is minus one. You just get 23 minus 23 equals zero because the margin utility of a is equal to the margin utility in be at equilibrium. The sum of utilities is maximized and that's the end of the story. So that you noticed in the problem set something like that you may not have given exactly this argument. That was what you were supposed to have sort of discovered in doing the problem set and now we've confirmed what you already pretty much knew. So are there any questions about that?

Speaker 1:          00:10:13       Okay. It's just the simple generalization of our football ticket example where the football tickets end up in the hands of the people who want the more the most and a happens to like a lot of tickets, not just one. And so a is going to keep buying tickets until he's bought 77 of them and by then the next football tickets and let worth less than 23 two m B she likes football tickets a little less. She's not going to buy as many. By the time she gets down to a seven football tickets, she's going to think I'm so, she hasn't bought in nearly as many when she's gotten to seven football tickets, she's going to think the next one's worth less than 23 and since the price is 23 uh, they're, they're the, they're going to both stop there. So they're each going to stop at the same point with the last ticket is worth the same to each of them and all the previous football tickets, each bod is worth more than each of them. So there's no way of rearranging the tickets. Cause if you did, you'd have to take a football ticket that was worth more than 23 from one of them and give a that ticket to the other one who buy them would think it was worth less than 23 so that's, that's the argument.

Speaker 1:          00:11:20       Okay. So economists were, fell were beside themselves with their brilliance. And having proved this theorem and given a mathematical form to the invisible hand, whenever you take a verbal argument like Adam Smith and turn it into a mathematical argument, you've understood it better. You understand why it's true. And you also start to understand why in some circumstances it might not be true. So for 50 years, let's say between 30 and 50 years, this was the fundamental argument of economics and economic equilibrium that I could live on was a good thing, cause it maximize the sum of utilities. But then little by little, starting with Irving Fisher and a bunch of people at the same time and a little bit later, so Hixon Samuelson are famous for this. They began to wonder what kind of crazy utility functions are these where there's some mysterious God that has constant margin utility of one.

Speaker 1:          00:12:15       So in modern terms, how could you justify it? You could say, well, maybe there's a machine where we, uh, can calibrate exactly how happy people are and we can measure it. So for example, we can measure how much, uh, how many, how many, uh, how aroused their skin is. What would you know the, the, the skin texture changes as you, as you become less than more rounds. Maybe we could measure that. You know, with Mris we can measure brainwaves. Maybe you can calibrate how many brainwaves were spinning around and how happy somebody isn't. Maybe there's some mysterious good like food that has constant margin utility. Well that doesn't seem very persuasive to me. And it wasn't to the economist. So the beginning of the 20th century, they all argued starting with Irving Fischer that it made no sense to think that we could actually measure utility and, and, and, and more than that made even less sense that be some good that had constant margin utility of one.

Speaker 1:          00:13:10       So Fisher put everything on a symmetric footing and said, let's think of the two goods x and y is more or less symmetric. I mean, there's no reason why one has to have some special role. So let's look at this equilibrium, which we got the same way. And you did this on a problem set solving correct delivering. Does this maximize the sum of utilities? Well, the answer is if it did maximize the sum of utilities at the final allocation, we couldn't gain anything by switching, you know, reducing nine fifths a little bit and increasing six fifths a little bit. But what is the sum of utilities? Okay, so if you write WIA plus WV okay, it's going to be for one thing, three fourths log x, say plus. Um, two thirds log XP. So let's look at the margin utility to EC. Save Good. A, that's three fourths. So margin utility of a x plus margin utility of B x equals three fourths times one over nine fifth, which is five ninth. Okay, that equals 15 over 36, which is five over 18. If I've done that right, it doesn't sound right. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:14:34       right.

Speaker 1:          00:14:37       512 thank you. That sounds better. And now, but let's look at the, so this is the margin utility of X. Say, okay, is a five twelves what's the margin utility, uh, to be a vax? Well, n equals two thirds times one over six fast, which is five, six a, which is 10 over 18, which is five over nine. So these two numbers are different. The margin utility to be is bigger than the margin. Utility of acts is bigger than the margin utility. The a of x. So clearly the final equilibrium allocation doesn't maximize the sum of utilities. By switching some goods from a to B. You could make both people better off. So that was a shock to economist. It meant that the argument they'd relied on the thing which they were using to persuade, you know, policy people that a, the free markets were good thing was a pho is a false argument.

Speaker 1:          00:15:36       It rests on a premise that's indefensible, namely that there's constant margin utility and everybody can measure it. So they needed some other definition of some other way of capturing the mathematical idea that the invisible hand is a good thing. And the reason I'm spending so much time emphasizing this, even though you've seen this before, is because if economist made a mistake once, what makes you think they haven't made another mistake? So now let's give the argument that, uh, in a week or since the invisible hand holds that is that the free market comes to a very, uh, socially desirable equilibrium. And later in the course we're going to find that their argument is also too narrow. So my point that I'm going to gradually get to is that economists have constantly taken too narrow and too special view of the world. And as you enlarge the view of the world, you have not by making things mathematically simpler, actually, you have to make the mathematically slightly more complicated.

Speaker 1:          00:16:34       As you enlarge the view of the world you have, you get closer to the truth and you start to find that the free market isn't quite as wonderful as you thought at first. And therefore there's a, there's room for government regulation. So it's not as Paul Krugman argued that that economists are transfixed by mathematics and seduced into, into simple conclusions that the free market is perfect. On the contrary, I would say they buy, they were afraid of too much mathematics. And by looking too narrowly, they didn't realize what they could have just by, by being mathematically more sophisticated. So it's a failure of sophistication, not too much sophistication. So what did, what did the economists argue so that the chief among them, Hicks, Anderson, Paredo and Fisher, all these people basically came to the same conclusion. They said, well, it makes no sense to maximize, to talk about the sum of utilities. Let's talk about predo efficiency. So an allocation. So, so we began, so what's the general problem? The general problems you start with an economy. Okay. Made up of all these individuals, let's call them waa and WB, but it could be as many as we want. So let's just say Wwi and II. I, so he, I is the endowment of x and I of why.

Speaker 1:          00:18:00       So that's the economy. And now every, so you start from the economy and you'd go to equilibrium. An equilibrium is a price factor. P X, P Y and allocations x, Y, Aye. Aye. Aye. Such that.

Speaker 2:          00:18:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:26       Summation for all the eyes of x equals the summation for all the eyes of e X. Okay. So everyone's fine. Ice Final consumption of ax plus js, final consumption of eggs, plus everybody else's final consumption of eggs. Those are the son of the exercise is equal to the summer. Everybody's endowment. And similarly for the wise,

Speaker 4:          00:18:55       alright, let's see, I why

Speaker 1:          00:18:58       and such that everybody is doing what's in their personal interests,

Speaker 4:          00:19:03       which is maximizing. W I have x, Y, z Max of Wwi. Exci such that he acts a times x Plus p y times y equals t x, x plus B. Why did y eat y is solved by XII. Why? All right.

Speaker 1:          00:19:34       That's the definition of equilibrium. Everybody individually optimizes, looking at his own budget. Set the hell with everybody else. Does the best in his interest chooses exci why I at the going prices? Supply equals demand. That's how you get the final allocation. So that's the definition of equilibrium and now we're trying to argue that's a good thing. Okay, and so what's our criterion? Well, what parade on edge worth and everybody else decided is let's look at the welfare functions, Waa and WB. So if you take some allocation, like the original allocation to one and one, two you'll have a utility, a welfare of each person. Three fourths log, two plus one quarter log, one. That's the welfare bay. And Welfare will be, will be two thirds log, one plus one third log too. So that'll be some point here.

Speaker 4:          00:20:29       So this is welfare. Be Welfare, a at initial endowment.

Speaker 2:          00:20:41       Okay?

Speaker 4:          00:20:42       Neutral endowment.

Speaker 3:          00:20:46       And if you look at the welfare at the final allocation, so three quarters, LogMeIn, fiscals, one portal log, three halves, you know, it's going to be something like this, it's gotta be up here. So it's going to be better for both people. How do you know that? Because a had the choice of just buying his initial one down, one that's always affordable, and he chose not to do it. He chose to do something else and he was better off in the same with B. So clearly the equilibrium allocation is going to be better than the initial endowment. And so the parade or criterion Pareto criterion

Speaker 4:          00:21:22       is that, um, uh, an allocation

Speaker 3:          00:21:32       x hat I y hat I paredo dominates

Speaker 2:          00:21:43       allocation.

Speaker 3:          00:21:47       So this is for all I XII. Let's put the eyes on the top.

Speaker 2:          00:21:54       Yes.

Speaker 4:          00:21:56       If and only f everybody's better off. That'd be you. I excellent. I had, it's bigger than w x, Y, y. So

Speaker 3:          00:22:11       we started with an allocation, the allocation here, and then we moved to competitive equilibrium here and everybody may was better off. So the [inaudible] allocation prayed or dominates the initial allocation. But now the question is maybe there's some other allocation besides the competitive, I could live my allocation that dominates, um, that dominates the equilibrium allocation. So this

Speaker 4:          00:22:38       CRM CRM is that if p x, y, y I, I and I is an, uh, is a, an equilibrium for the economy. The economy. He

Speaker 3:          00:23:06       remember we defined the economy. He put he here.

Speaker 2:          00:23:14       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:23:14       Van, no allocation. X Hat on I y hat. All right. I am, I pereno dominates. All right. So why if summation XII hat equals

Speaker 1:          00:23:47       I x

Speaker 1:          00:23:50       and summation, it's got a little too tight here. Sorry about this. Y Hat. I equals. This is overall y equals summation. E I why? Okay. So let's, let's, yeah, I can read this, this really bad critical line right in the corner. So I'll just say it in words and then read it literally. So this, this allocation dominates this one. The competitive equilibrium dominated the initial endowment. But maybe there's some other way of rearranging the gods that gets you even further out here. So what I'm, the Theorem says that's impossible. So it says if you start with a competitive equilibrium with an allocation xy, y for the economy, he the no allocation like that one. No allocation x I had, why I had can pray will dominate it. This couldn't happen. You'd have to be down here somewhere. That couldn't happen. Provided this other allocation used up there

Speaker 3:          00:24:49       resources that were available. So the sum of the xs and this allocation is the, some of the initial endowments and the sum of the YS. And this allocation is the some of the initial endowments over the people. So nothing else. Of course, if you add more goods to the economy, you can make everybody better off. But using the existing goods in the economy, which is the sum of the aix is in the son of the Ui wise, there's no way to make everyone better off than at the competitive equilibrium. So it says literally if p EXCI why is an equilibrium for the economy e which is that which includes the initial endowments, the no allocation Exci hat. Why I hat parade? Oh dominates EXCI. Why? If the sum over, I have x hat, eagles are some over, I have e I x, and if the sum of the y eyes over I equals y had eyes over, I equals the sum of the EIY.

Speaker 1:          00:25:45       Okay, and others, that's the theorem. So we've totally weakened the definition of equilibrium. So might be that if you, if you add, if this is the competitive allocation, if you look at this line, this is same psalm of utilities,

Speaker 1:          00:26:04       right? Because of the slope is minus one. And here's the utility to be in the utility to a, everything on this line has the same utility. So that theorem would say anything else that's feasible had to be down here. The sum is less than that. But here we're not saying that we're no longer saying that maybe you can increase the sum from this sacral liberty and you could increase the sum by taking something away from a and giving it to be, you could increase the sum. Okay, so that would have been here. You increase the sum so you no longer

Speaker 3:          00:26:35       maximize the sum. But the fact is to make, be better off. He had to make a worse off. And that's the new criteria. Predo efficiency.

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       Okay. So that's the CRM and now we're going to prove it so that you can see the whole logic of the free market is just amounts to that. So there are any questions about this? Do you all supposedly saw this before? But um, that doesn't mean you really did. So does anyone have a question? What's going on? It's a very basic, incredibly important idea.

Speaker 2:          00:27:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:07       All right. So have you one more chance. Somebody must have a question. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:27:15       Can.

Speaker 1:          00:27:17       Yes. Why don't I draw a picture, which is what I was going to do anyway. So let's draw a picture and I'll, I'll bring the theorem back after having drawn the picture. Okay. So the picture is going to be due to Edgeworth. So he invented the indifference curve and invented it in order to draw this picture. That was incredibly clever picture. So he says, let's look at this economy. And the one on the right that we start with, we put x a here, an Xb here, and you notice that a begins with an endowment of two. One. So let's put as endowment to one here.

Speaker 2:          00:28:05       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:28:05       so this is he a x equal to, and this is e B e a y equal one. Right. That makes sense. Okay. Now we can draw indifference curves through that. So there's difference curves. He likes x more than he likes. Why? So the difference curves are going to be sort of vertical right up. He doesn't like to give up x very much. So he's in different curves are going to look sort of like this.

Speaker 2:          00:28:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:36       And the most important indifference curves are the ones where he gets better off than he was before. So now in the end, they're going to be some price. He's going to have a, there's going to be a budget set, which is x is way more expensive than y. So there's going to be a budget set that looked like this. That's sort of the budget set that he faces. Right? And he's not going to choose this. It turns out he chooses something like here, which is, um, he chooses a little bit less of acts nine fifths.

Speaker 2:          00:29:18       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:29:19       Okay. And a little bit more of why. So here's x, say equals nine fifth which is a little less than two and xb he chose was a, I can't read it, three halves, which is more than one. Okay. Are you with me? That make, are you, you asked the question, does this picture make sense? Okay, so he obviously did better

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       than he did before, but it's really, you know, we've got another guy to worry about. So how can you put the second guy in the same diagram? Well, let's just finish. Let's just add the total endowment. Where's the total endowment? Well, it's three units of each. So here we've got two. So this is one.

Speaker 5:          00:30:03       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:30:05       To this must be three. Okay, so total endowment of good x is three two plus one is three and I'm good. Why is three as well? Here's one, here's two. Here's three was supposed to be a square. So heres the aggregate endowment. It's here. This is the total endowment. Three of three of each. Okay. But now we can do, we can put B. All right. So what is feasible? What are the feasible allocations? So this is a, an extremely clever inside of edge worth. He said, look, the total endowment is three common three. If I tell you that a has got two common one, that's this point, what's leftover be must be consuming. So bees consuming the distance from here to here, which is obviously one comma two and if a ends up over here at nine 53 halves, okay? That's from here to here is nine fifths and three halves since the total is three three B's obviously doing, consuming what's leftover.

Speaker 3:          00:31:12       So he's consuming this difference. Okay? So whatever a does, you can see in the diagram looking at it the normal way. But if you just sort of twist your mind a little bit and look from this direction, once you know what a is doing, you can figure out what bees doing. So each of these points defines a feasible allocation. Okay? And now what we want to say, the Theorem says, look at the utilities that a and B I got out of this allocation. A God is on this indifference curve. You know what he's doing cause it be, you know it was coming from here. We know how he's, how he's doing. So look at the allocation they got. You can't make both people better off than that by choosing some other point in this square. So let's look at it from bees point of view. From bees point of view, he likes more of everything. So if a gets less, B's going to get more. So from bees point of view, the further out you go, this way the veteran is for for a, B, c, so B's, the axes for B looks like that. So he's going to have some indifference curve.

Speaker 5:          00:32:15       That

Speaker 3:          00:32:22       B's indifference curve is going to look.

Speaker 5:          00:32:26       MMM,

Speaker 3:          00:32:29       he's indifference curve has to look like this. So here's where be started here. And then B's going to be better off doing lists. So B's indifference curve looks, something like that. Those are Bs and difference curves.

Speaker 3:          00:32:50       Okay. So the further out you go this way, the better off P is. So as you shrink with aid gets, that obviously means bees getting more. And so bees getting happier and happier. Okay. So what, what is the definition of prey to efficiency? Whatever point we pick. Like this one to begin with. Is there a way of making both people better off? Well, the answer is the competitive equilibrium makes both people better off. Why is that? If you can see it from back there. Uh, the reason is that a went from this white indifference curve to a better indifference curve over here be who's budget line is the same budget line looked at from his point of view. He went from his indifference curve over here to one here. Okay. So he went from this yellow indifference curve to a better one. So both of them got better off going to this, uh, final allocations.

Speaker 3:          00:33:39       And they started with, and of course that had to be true because a could always have chosen to stay where he was at two one he moved to nine. Fifth three has cause it was better and B could have started, stayed where she was at one. Two she chose to go to five. Two to six fifths. Three has cause it made her better off. So both of the must be better off at the final allocation and the word to begin with. Okay. Now what is the theorem say? The theorem says, remember in pictures it says whatever point we pick here that defines something for a and define something for B. Then we can look at the utility welfare functions of both and see what indifference curves there on the theorem says. There's no other point in this whole diagram, which puts both a and B on a higher indifference curve for each of them than they were at the competitive equilibrium. So if I read the definition again, it says if I'm at, if I start with an economy there with the endowments and the Utility Functions, so the endowments and the indifference curves and I compute the competitive equilibrium like we did over there. Okay, then no allocation, that means no point in that box could make everybody better off than they were at the competitive equilibrium provided

Speaker 3:          00:34:52       that Newpoint is in the box. So it makes the sum of the xs equal to the sum of the endowments and the sum of the ys equal to the sum of the endowments of why.

Speaker 2:          00:35:02       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:35:03       Okay. So Edgeworth this is the end of the proof. We already gave the proof according to Edgeworth. Okay, so what's the proof? According to Edgeworth, he says it's all a matter of looking at it the right way. It's easy to look at the picture from aes point of view. You just look at the x axis and the y axis. Okay? This is the y axis.

Speaker 2:          00:35:29       What is this? This is,

Speaker 3:          00:35:34       this is a x. A why it was three halves. Okay, so you look at it. So this is the y axis going this way. This is the y axis. And this is the x axis going this way for a, it's very simple to look at the y axis and the x axis for a A's got his indifference curve getting better and better. Okay. And um, B. Okay, so from [inaudible] point of view, it's very simple. You look at the endowment, you draw the budget line through it, which is some linear line, and then a picks. The best point in that budget set drawing the tangent, which is the white indifference curve to this point right here. That's the best he can do. Now the trick is to see that from bees point of view up here. From these point of view of here, things look very similar because bees and downwind is also at this point he's got one unit up here of x and two units of y.

Speaker 3:          00:36:30       Okay, why does he have that? Because the two together added up to three. So if this is what A's and dumb it was, then of course what's leftover is bs endowment, so be it has to go here. Now what is the budget set look like for me? Well, it's also a linear thing with the same slope and it goes through this point. So from his point of view, this pink line is also his budget set. It goes from here all the way down to where it hits his y axis down here they've got the same budget set. Just looked at it from opposite sides. Okay. And now what does competitive equilibrium and supply equals demand means it means that we're an AA chooses this point as the best point. Okay. Which happened to have been nine fifths, three halves then be is happy to choose what's leftover is his best point.

Speaker 3:          00:37:15       So his optimal point on his indifference curves, that's tangent to his budget set has to be the same point looked at from his origin instead of A's origin. That's the trick. And so now you real, okay. So that's the key insight that Edgeworth had, his beautiful picture. And now the point is that if the quite indifference curve looks like that, anything that makes a better off has to be on this side of the white indifference curve. And the yellow indifference curve, which is B's indifference curve, anything that makes her better off has to be on this side of the yellow curve. But the white curve goes that way and the yellow curve goes that way. So there's no point that's simultaneously above A's indifference curve and also above B's indifference curve. So therefore nothing could parade or dominate it. So that's the Edgeworth proof. Yes. Right? That the pink budget line describes what you can afford to buy, describes the budget equation, this equation. So everyone's going to choose on the pink line. Okay? Now what's feasible as they could choose, any points, it's feasible. You're going to cook this point is feasible. B gets almost nothing in a, it gets almost everything. Bees never going to let himself be forced down there because B can choose on the pink wines.

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       He's always going to choose something better than that.

Speaker 2:          00:38:40       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:38:41       Okay, so that's proof number one. I'm just going to give proof number two. So okay, you've, most of you've seen this before, but I'm going to give another proof and then I'm going to ask you a quick, then I'm going to see whether you really understand what all this means. Okay? So here's a second proof.

Speaker 1:          00:39:05       Okay? And this is a much better proof. So now approve. So I'm gonna write this Algebraic late, the proof of Arrow 1951 and Dobro 1951 separately. Okay, so this is called the fundamental theorem of economics first welfare theme, or if economics. Okay. So all this picture, I'll stuff make so many assumptions. You'll, there are only two kinds of traders. They're only two goods. There's somehow never, because they're consuming only on the boundaries. I mean, they're never consuming on the boundaries. It's always in this on know it, just so many special assumptions and, and uh, everything's two by two and it's just special case. So let's give a much more general proof of this theorem. So here we've got two goods won't play any role. There could be any number of goods. There are two goods only here, but there are many traders, lots and lots of traders. So what's the proof that x hat, why hat couldn't parade? Oh dominated. So suppose that we've got this is equal to summation, x hat I, and this is equal to the summation.

Speaker 2:          00:40:14       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:40:15       why Hat I? Okay, so we've got another allocation, which is feasible.

Speaker 2:          00:40:21       Cool.

Speaker 1:          00:40:24       So could it be that this other feasible allocations of x hats and white hats, could that make everybody better off? Could that make each I better off than Exci? Why I, and this proof is so short and so beautiful, so elegant. And so convincing that it's mesmerize people now for over 50 years and it, it prevents them from seeing that there could be even a more in general situations where things aren't so great. So what is the proof? It's two lines. If x at y hat is really better for I then I claim line one w I have x hat, uh, y hat. I, okay, this is, sorry. So this is this line zero. This is just repeating what's the case? Wwi of x had high. Why had I greater than W EXCI why? Hey, that's for all I, that's the claim. Could this happen that you've got a feasible x hat? I why had I and it makes everybody better off than Exci. Okay. Could this happen? The answer is no. Line one is, if that were true, then it would have to be the case that p x times x Xy hat plus p y times y hat I had to be greater than p x times x Plus p y times e I. Why? Why is that? Because the budget set of Mr I says

Speaker 3:          00:42:02       he spends all his money on x and Y in his budget set and does the best he can. Okay, this is Saul's Exci why I solves this problem. So if this thing really makes them better off than what he chose, it can't be that it was affordable. Otherwise he would have bought this instead. I ain't bought this instead. So it has to be that this Alec can for I, this bundle costs more than he can afford. That's why

Speaker 1:          00:42:25       choose it. So this relies on agent rationality. Everybody given his choices, he doesn't care about the rest of the world, but given his choices, everybody's doing the best thing he can. Okay. Now, Shiller would say people make mistakes. They're crazy. They have no idea what they're doing. They're stupid. They're, there's some guy tells him a story and the bar one night and they totally changed their life around. They switched, you know, the, so he'd say, well, this isn't true. All right. But anyway, I, I actually believe that people have more sense about deciding for themselves what's good for them. Then third parties do about deciding what's good for them. So I don't want to challenge

Speaker 3:          00:43:09       this. So if you don't challenge this, you conclude that if something makes everybody better off, each person must have found this allocation unaffordable. Otherwise he would have chosen it

Speaker 1:          00:43:19       over pie ea. I why it's all I did was that's true for every single person I saw. I could add this inequality for I plus listen to quality for j plus this and equality for all the people. And then I use the distributive law to take the sum inside and I have this, okay, but that is impossible and that's the end of the proof because the sum of this XII x had I is equal to this son. That was what we are supposed. You're just rearranging all the goods that are really there and this, um, is the same as this. Um, so therefore since the new allocation just rearranges the endowment differently from the equilibrium and rearranges the x's maybe differently from the equilibrium, it has to be that actually this thing on the left is equal to this thing in the right. It's identical to it. So I can't be greater. And that's the contradiction. That's the end of the proof. So it's two lines, two lines to prove what you know. Adam Smith's spent 400 pages arguing that the free market is a good thing. Okay. So this is the basis for the idea that we shouldn't regulate, we shouldn't regulate, we shouldn't. Sounds pretty convincing. So any questions about this? Anything that you'd like to say? I'm, are you convinced by this?

Speaker 1:          00:44:45       Okay. So what are some reasons you don't believe this? I need some obvious reason.

Speaker 5:          00:44:52       Yes. Well, even if this would make sense, a lot of regulation policies changing the pricing of the things anyways, so we're not necessarily,

Speaker 1:          00:45:05       no, but that's so you. Okay. So it's a good, so that glad you asked that question cause it no, no, it betrays a misunderstanding. So I'm glad you asked that question. So suppose that someone came in a given these assumptions that we've made. Okay. So this theme is correct, given the assumptions. Now he made a standard. Okay. So there was a little bit mistake in the reasoning he made. I'm going to repeat his question, change it a little bit so maybe he'll deny this is what he was saying. But I believe what he just said is what really happens in a lot of regulations as they come in and they change the prices, they tax and good, they prevent people from trading so much. So the price changes, they subsidize something, something happens so that you get different prices. And of course if those different prices you get a different allocation.

Speaker 1:          00:45:50       And then he said that's all true so far. And then he said, because there are different prices, um, you know, you can't compare the, the original equilibrium allocation to the new aqua lived from allocation. Well that's where he short changed this proof. This proof says, however you get to a new allocation x hat. I why had I, maybe it's because the government has intervened and changed all the prices and done a bunch of other stuff, but in the end, after all that intervention, the government is going to get you to a new allocation x had I why had I and that new allocation can't be better than the original one. Okay. So, so that's the force of the argument. No matter what the government does, it's going to, in the end, the, the upshot is a new allocation EC Sadye why had I, we don't have to think about how it got there. That's where it got, and according to this argument, it can't be better. So the argument is correct and elegant. There must be something missing to the arguments. Some assumption you don't really believe, if you doubt the argument, yes,

Speaker 5:          00:46:49       your allocation, even at the expensive,

Speaker 1:          00:46:56       what if you want an allocation?

Speaker 5:          00:46:58       It's socially desirable that have an allocation that's better for one party even if that comes up. Another one.

Speaker 1:          00:47:05       Okay, so one argument you could say is that all right, it may be. And the Aqua Librium that a, okay. So who's better off here? You notice that this equilibrium a ends up with more of everything than B does. Okay, so a, so you could say the second is not very socially desirable because a ends up with more of everything than B does released as much of everything is speed does and that unjust and unfair. And so we don't like the allocation. And so maybe we should move something from a to B. So that's an argument on the basis of justice. It says we can find, just are allocations, uh, that are somehow socially more desirable. But this argument of Predo efficiencies about efficiency, okay, maybe you could, uh, you know, you, you could hurt a to help B because that's, you know, serves your, your desire for fairness.

Speaker 1:          00:47:56       But that doesn't say anything about how efficient the allocation is. It's still true that the original allocation was efficient in the sense you couldn't make anyone better off. So the economist would say, in order to hurt a and help be, what you should do is take some of A's and downwind away from him and give it to her and then let them trade to a new competitive equilibrium where she began with more than him. So the just thing to do is to rearrange the resources at the beginning and still let people trade to a final allocation. Okay. So that's an argument from fairness, but it doesn't, it doesn't interfere. It doesn't contradict the economic argument that fair or unfair. It's still efficient. We've done as well as we could, making everyone as happy as we can and maybe we can hurt someone and help someone else. We can't help everyone at the same time. Whereas most regulation, the argument in favor of regulation is you're helping everybody by regulating. And this says you can't ever do that. So what's missing? What's some of the assumptions should be an elementary question for you. Yes,

Speaker 1:          00:48:58       no, it's got all those assumptions. So there's something about the model that's too narrow and you should be, and this should be easy and you're going to tell me obvious things where it's too narrow and then a and the, so I'm going to just say where we're going. You're supposed to be telling me now obvious ways. This is too narrow. I'm going to say you're right. You're right, you're right. But finance is different. We don't have to worry about those problems supposedly. So go ahead. Back there. You. Okay. So one critical shortcoming of this argument is that there are externalities. Suppose that, um, ex is cigarettes and a smoking, buying and smoking more cigarettes makes be sick. Okay? So that's not part of this. Why is that not part of this? Because bees utility depends only on bees consuming, not what AI is doing. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:46       So there's no place in this model, it's too narrow to include externalities. So it doesn't capture the fact that a might be making, he by smoking might make her sick by smoking so many cigarettes and that's not in here. And if you put the idea that utility bees, utilities, her utility might depend on what he's doing and now with just not what she's doing, the fear, it won't be true. So there's a reason to tax pollution and to tax cigarettes and all those things because of externalities. Okay. So that's the fun. That's a fundamental problem. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:50:22       Well, we're assuming diminishing margin utility, but there are different, each person has a different curves. So yes, we assume that they're all curved away from the origin. So we assumed diminishing margin utility. But I think you know, that, that I'm almost prepared to believe diminishing margin. Utill you know, it's not literally true. You don't like two tickets are better than, you know, uh, going from moving from one ticket to two tickets may be a huge gain in utility cause now you can bring your friend along and going to third, a third ticket. Uh, you know, going from getting one ticket might not be worth much because you don't want to go alone. Getting the second one may add a huge amount of utility that's an increasing margin utility, but eventually after you've got enough tickets, it's going to be diminishing margin utilities. So I believe on the whole, the diminishing margin.

Speaker 1:          00:51:05       Utilities, not such a bad assumption, but this clearly relies on that. So you're right, but I'm not, I don't think that's the critical problem. What else is there? Yes. What? Okay. Credit markets. Right now we're starting to talk a little bit about finance. So just hold that thought for one second. Anything else you can think of besides externalities? That's terrible for, okay, so, all right, so, okay, so let me transition this way. So of course people noticed externalities and other kinds of regulation is perfect competition. And you know, we assumed everyone took the prices has given there are enough, there was no monopolist, you know, setting the price and refusing to bargain with people and stuff like that. So regulation could come about in order to enforce the competitive equilibrium to allow for perfect competition. So we assumed that already, that's one place for regulation and a second place is because of these externalities.

Speaker 1:          00:51:56       So for a hundred, you know, 50 to 100 years, everybody has accepted those two arguments. Clearly there's a place for regulating free markets, ensuring free markets and stopping trusts and monopolies and for stopping externalities. But then people said finance okay is different. As long as you know there aren't any externalities. You know, you're just trading stocks and bonds, there's no pollution. Nobody's going to get sick because someone else has a stock or a bond. Some people, it might be jealous, but we're not really going to take that into account. We don't, we don't want to honor those kinds of feelings of jealousy. So the arguments seem to be when you get to finance, you don't have to worry about externalities. And yes, you have to worry about perfect competition. But once you've got perfect competition, that's the end of the story. So the rest of the course now is going to be, if you've, if you forget about externalities, okay, because you forget about pollution because you know, there were trading pieces of paper, they're not polluting anything.

Speaker 1:          00:52:51       Why shouldn't the financial markets be efficient? Why doesn't this argument apply to the financial markets? And one of the critical financial markets is the credit market. So can you understand the credit market on just these terms and therefore argue that the market's efficient. So we're going to spend a large part of the course talking about that. So unless you had some particular point to raise, now I'm going to just use your comment is a good introduction to the, to the next part of the course. Okay. So, so far there's nothing that seems to directly involve finance, what we've been talking about. So where does the finance come in? So Irving Fisher was the person who created the first really general equilibrium model of finance. So he was a Yale undergraduate. Uh, he, you know, was a superstar at Yale undergraduate and he invented a, anyway, he had an, he had graduated first in his class from Yale.

Speaker 1:          00:53:47       He decided that he was a math major. He decided that he wanted to go. He wanted to build an economic, uh, financial Eq Librium model. There were no economists there at his time. We're talking in the late 18 hundreds. And so he went to Gibbs, the famous physicist, maybe a Ma, you know, one of America's most famous physicist at the time and said, can you, can you, uh, advise an ex, uh, you know, an economics phd? And Gibbs said, well, if it's mathematical enough and has a model and something, yes, I can do it. And so, fishers a PhD dissertation was basically reinventing this general equilibrium model that I've just described, and then making a machine to calculate equilibrium with water and pumps and water seeking its own level and solving for equilibrium. And we had this machine up until the 1970s in the Coles Foundation. Well when it got stolen and, uh, some, some engineer named Srinivasa and about 10 years ago was ready to rebuild the machine because we have the dissertation where it explains very carefully how Fisher built his machine and he was going to rebuild it.

Speaker 1:          00:54:52       And then he was offered Elbar dies job Albara die is the guy, the nuclear inspector who you know, goes to a rock and says they're building nuclear stuff and not building this. And so he was offered that job and so he left Yale and then decided not to take the job after all. So he's still got Albury die in the job. And, but anyway, he left Yale and so we never got the machine built. Uh, he was a great guy. And, uh, anyway, so Fisher, uh, after, um, Fisher after writing this dissertation stayed at Yales and assistant professor got tenure. It became the most famous economist probably in the country for awhile. Um, he invented finances. I'm about to tell you. And he in in a way, this model of finance I'm about to present, which was the, you know, in retrospect, clearly the most interesting model of finance if it's time.

Speaker 1:          00:55:44       And he was a financial economist, but he was famous for, he also was an entrepreneur. So you'll see later that he started his own company. It was a pro computer company called Remington and he managed to make $10 million, uh, for his company in the early 19 hundreds and a, he was a friend of Roosevelt's and he kept advising Roosevelt during the depression to print more money. He said, print more money, print more money, put more money in the Yale Library has all these letters he sent to Roosevelt. And it also has Roosevelt's responses where you can tell that Roosevelt is paying no attention to them. But, but Fisher's ego seemed to be so big that he just, I mean, you know, Roosevelt says, I'm very glad that the good professor has made such more the recommendations and we'll certainly take them seriously. And then Fisher writes back and says, I'm glad you're going to follow.

Speaker 1:          00:56:31       What I suggested. And so, so anyway, Fisher convinced that the economy was going to turn around, poured all his money into this computer company, Remington, the company and the great stock market crash, nearly went bankrupt and was leveraged. So he had to go to his, uh, he had to go to his wife who was very wealthy and borrow her money and that they lost that money. Then he went to her parents and borrow all their money and lost that money. And finally he'd lost everything of his own money, his wife's money and his wife's parents money. And they're about to take his house from him, foreclosed on his house. And so Yale was forced to buy his house forums so he can continue to teach. And so, so he set a bad precedent for economist at Yale because whenever any economist at Yale has financial advice to give someone, always quotes Irvin Fischer's 1929 line that the economy had reached a permanently high plateau.

Speaker 1:          00:57:23       And, but anyway, despite all that, he still, uh, his theories are well worth studying. He was famous for a few other things. He's a little bit Shiller as Cooley trying to imitate Fisher. Fisher wrote a huge number of books, 50 books about everything. So he got tuberculosis and he survived and he wrote a series of books on good living in good health and how to combat tuberculosis. So he said, you had to exercise, you have to get fresh air. And these were huge bestsellers. And um, then he said that drinking was a terrible thing. So he did an experiment in class where he would have his students do pushups, then he'd give them all of our teeny, then he'd count how many pushups they could do, and then you give them a second Martini in countering the questions they could do. And he found that there was a 10% reduction for each Martini.

Speaker 1:          00:58:13       And so he said that prohibition, since the average business person had two drinks at lunch, the prohibition would increase output by 20%. And so he's one of the, he was one of the leading, he was one of the leading proponents of, of prohibition. So in that, after the stock market crash, he helped form the Coles Foundation. Um, so he, so he, and a bunch, so what, so Coles, uh, who was a Yale undergraduate, uh, had run a very famous, uh, uh, macro forecasting company in the 1920s. And in 1929, the stock market crashed and he, there were a whole series of these, they said newsletters, you know, same kind of stuff they do now. He, unlike all the others, after the fact realized that he hadn't anticipated anything about the crash, much like nobody anticipated it now. And he was so embarrassed. He went and collected not only his old recommendations themselves, but all his competitors.

Speaker 1:          00:59:10       And so he published a famous paper in which he argued that it, you know, economist had no idea what they were talking about, the fact that they were frauds. And so he went to his old economist, Irving Fisher at Yale and said, look, I just believe that economics without mathematics has no meaning. I want to start a mathematical wing of economics. And I've got a lot of money. He, his, his, uh, his family owned the Chicago Tribune and the Seattle times and a whole bunch of other newspapers. And there was a famous, you know, fashion models and the family fleur coals and stuff like that. So anyway, so with Coles money, Fisher started the econometric society, uh, which is the most famous mathematical society and economics, Econometrica, which is the most famous journal in economics. And the Coles Foundation, which they moved, which they started off in Colorado Springs because cold Fisher set all the, the weather's so good there, everyone want to go there and it's good for them.

Speaker 1:          01:00:04       So nobody would go there. So they had to move it to Chicago where the Tribune was and it was in Chicago from 1930 to 1955. And then in 1955, it moved to Yale. And since then the Coles Foundation has been a at Yale and you'll hear a lot more about it later. But anyway, so Kohl's with that background, he set out to figure out how to turn economics. In fact, he invented economics, this model of equilibrium to study finance. But so far we don't have any finance in the model. So how can you put it in? Well, what is missing? What do I need to put in the model in order to have to turn it into finance? What would you say is missing? How would you turn this into finance? What are the key thing? Yes. Okay. So the first thing, oh, of course, you may have read ahead in the notes, but that's a brilliant insight. If it's yours, um, you need, you need time in the model. So far we just had, you know, apples and oranges or something being traded. So the first thing is Fisher said you need to put time in the model. What else is critically missing in this model? One other thing. The major other thing. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:01:23       what?

Speaker 1:          01:01:24       Okay. Well that's good. There's risk that's missing entirely. So Fisher actually couldn't figure out how to put that in the model, but we're gonna, we're gonna get to that. So what else did Fisher, what? That was great. That's very good. What else is missing?

Speaker 2:          01:01:38       Yup.

Speaker 1:          01:01:40       Okay. Wow. Okay. So time fishing, you'll see had something to say about time and impatience that people always care more about the present and the future. But what other fundamental thing about what is the finance all about? When you think about finance, what do you think about? Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:01:58       Great.

Speaker 1:          01:01:59       Okay. So you think about credit as she said, credit interest rates. Okay, and what else? Sure. Return. Okay, that's quite related to that. So all this has to go on the model, but what fundamental object, when you think the first thing you think about, what do you think of? Yes. Money. Okay. So that's not what I had in mind, but I'm glad that you think about that's what most of these, right? That is what most people think about. So money. So in this course, we're not going to provide a theory of money. So Fisher did provide his theory of money and that's what he was talking to Roosevelt about all the time. But we're not gonna. So he, we're going to talk about inflation and stuff like that, but not a theory. We're not going to explain where the inflation comes from. So inflation is going to be very important, but we're not going to talk about a theory of money. So what else is missing? Something really basic though. Yes. Okay. So there are no banks and things like that. Institutions.

Speaker 2:          01:03:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:04       Okay. And still something come on. What, what, what's the

Speaker 2:          01:03:09       what?

Speaker 1:          01:03:12       Loaning funds? Well, somebody said credit. That's sort of loaning funds and interest rates and collateral. That's something that's good then I'm going to add that. Thank you. What a brilliant idea. And what, what, what, what uh, what basic thing come on. Yes. No. Well, okay. That's in the model where as well, it's already there. So you know when you take your endowment and you multiply it by the prices in your budget set, that's your wealth. So wealth is already, we've got, well gabble capital. Okay, so capital and let's say, and what is capital? What do you mean by capital? It's money. I already told you that's not quite going to be there. So contract will you? Okay, so con, so we're getting their contract assets. Okay. So assets, that's the main thing that's on my write it over here. Assets. Okay. After all the stock market is about, I mean finances a lot about the stock market, bond markets, mortgage markets, those are all assets that you buy that pay money, pay dividends later.

Speaker 1:          01:04:17       So assets are things that pay dividends at a later time. That's the critical thing that's missing. And when we talk about finance, we want to know what should the value of the stock market be, how much should a mortgage be worth? And it will turn and, and um, okay, so those are the things we have to add. Now how are we going to add them? It sounds like you might have to just totally Redo the theory and start from scratch and do something totally different. How horrible that would be would mean I also wasted three lectures. So Fisher said you don't really have to change very much at all. So he said, number one time, how do you put time in the model? Simply think of, think of why as the same

Speaker 2:          01:05:03       good

Speaker 1:          01:05:05       as x, but one period later.

Speaker 2:          01:05:12       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:05:14       so fish are sad. You know, time isn't such a big deal. Already got two goods. You know, these old, these, these crazy marginalist before me, they had good acts, which was interesting and this very boring good why? And so you know, things, it's not so clear how you can have a time and everything in the model. But I've already got two interesting goods. X and Y, they're both, you know, entering on, on the scene with the same symmetric properties. I mean, no, neither one of them seems more interesting or more important than the other ones. So in fact maybe they're the same. Good. It's just x and y is the same. Good. It's one, one comes one period later. Now next class we're going to talk about, you're not going to value them the same amount, the utility for x and why won't be the same.

Speaker 1:          01:05:55       So here a obviously things more of x than he does of why. And by the way, B, she also thinks more of x then she does about why. So why is that? Well, if y is the same as x, but a year later people are impatient. So the reason why a might like x better than Y and B also is not because they're different goods, but because they're impatient. So we're going to come to that later. So we can have the idea that they're two different time periods and the economy simply by a change of notation and not, uh, not, uh, not introducing anything new at all. Well, what about assets? How can you put sob coming? They're going to come back to that in the next class. What about assets? How can you introduce assets into the economy? Well, Fisher says what is the essence of an asset? The essence of an acid is that it's something you hold today because later it's going to deliver you money or goods or something. And we're not going to talk about money. So we're imagining these are all wheel acids. Um, so they're going to deliver goods in the future. So asset, the definition of an asset is an asset.

Speaker 2:          01:07:08       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:07:08       When we have to make it mathematical. So the whole Fisher started the society to make economics mathematical. So an acid is literally something that delivers goods in the future. So an acid

Speaker 4:          01:07:20       defined by its payoffs.

Speaker 2:          01:07:28       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:07:29       The X and d y. So we could call that acid alpha [inaudible] acid alpha is defined by its payoffs, the acts and

Speaker 1:          01:07:39       Dyi. So it's going to pay a certain amount of acts in a certain amount of why. That's all there is. Now we're going to ask, do people actually know what the payoff of why he's going to be if wise in the future. That means it hasn't happened yet. Do we really know what was is going to be and so Fisher, so we have to, and so you know, maybe we know less about one asset, more about another asset. So maybe one assets riskier than another acid. So someone said risk. Obviously that's going be a very fundamental question, but before we come to risk, if we don't have any risk yet, cause Fisher didn't know how to put it in and we're going to start with his model where there's no risk. Okay. Then if there's just today and tomorrow and everybody's rational, everybody, since there's no one certain, everybody wants to be able to anticipate exactly what the dividends going to be. So the acid is no different from what its dividend is going to be. Maybe it's paying something today and also it's going to pay something tomorrow. So assets are defined by their dividends. Nothing more than that. So if a model now becomes a model where we have the aide Wri and then we have a Wii, and then we have the goods is before the endowments of the goods. But we've added a new thing, which is we've added the acids, d alpha acts and d l for y.

Speaker 2:          01:09:02       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:09:02       So the ALFALFA's overall the assets, and we have to add everybody's ownership of the assets to begin with. So we have to have theta, I'm going to call it fate of Bar Alpha.

Speaker 2:          01:09:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:15       Ate a bar. I alpha.

Speaker 1:          01:09:22       So how much of acid Alpha does I own? So that's the economy that we're going to start with. Okay? So we've made the model much more, we made the model a bit more complicated. We started what we were, we did before with utilities and endowments of chords. Now we're adding acids, which pay off more goods and where, and of course people begin owning trees. And stuff like that. So a tree is an acid, it's going to pay Apple's later on and people, various different people own various different trees. So we've got to the old economy, we add something new and now fishers, ingenious insight was that if you think about this, which we will for a little while, you'll be able to discover that you can simplify this economy back down to the economy we began with. So you can start talking about acids and interest and all kinds of other things using the same analysis before. So with my last thought here, what would you, what has interest have to do with px over p? Why? Suppose they're both. What does px over p why? Suppose they're both apples. So acts as an apple today. Why is an apple next year? What does px over p? Why it says how much an apple is worth today relative to how much an apple was worth tomorrow. So, so, so this is going to turn out to be one plus the real interest rate. Fisher would call it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:10:48       Because if Px is more than p y, let's say px is a, you know, 20% more than p. Why what it means is by giving up one apple today, you can get 1.2 apples tomorrow. That's just what happens when you put money in the bank. You give up something today, you get exactly the same thing back next period. But more of it. So you see, just by having time and the price is like we had before, you're going to see very how interest, acids, everything is going to start coming into play very quickly. So I didn't put the problem set on the web yet cause I wasn't sure how far we'll get, but I'll put it on in a couple hours and we'll start again on Thursday.
