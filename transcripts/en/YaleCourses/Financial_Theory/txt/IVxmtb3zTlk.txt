Speaker 1:          00:00:01       I think I'm going to start. Um, so this is really the beginning of the finance part of the course. So far we've reviewed general equilibrium, which I said Fisher invented or reinvented in order to do finance. And as you remember, the, the, the, the main conclusions from general equilibrium are first that uh, the market functioning by itself without interference from the outside. In other words, the situation of Laissez faire leads to allocations that are parade Oh, efficient. So they're in some sense good for the economy and good for the society. They don't maximize total welfare. That's not even a well defined thing as we saw last time. Because how can you measure, how can you add one person's utility to another? It doesn't even make sense. So economists at first were wrong to think of that as the criterion for good allocations. But there's another better definition of efficiency.

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       That parade oh invented called Credo efficiency. And the free market achieves pray to efficiency at least if there are no externalities and there's no monopoly. So that lesson number one was taken to mean that the government shouldn't, shouldn't interfere in the free market, especially shouldn't interfere in financial markets. And that's something we're going to come to examine. The second lesson we found was that the price is determined by marginal utility. So if you, it's not determined by total utility. So, uh, it may be that water is much more valuable than diamonds because it does a lot more good for everybody and for the world as a whole than diamonds do. But the last drop of water, really, most people have as much water as they need. The last drop of water's not doing that much, whereas the last diamond is a rare thing and not many people have them.

Speaker 1:          00:01:47       So the last drop of water is worth less than the last equal weight of diamonds. And therefore water's much cheaper than diamonds, even though waters much more valuable as a whole than diamonds. The price of things depend on their marginal utility. Uh, so you, you, uh, a third implication of what we did is that there's no such thing as the just price. It depends on what people's utilities are and how much they like it. It depends on how much of the good there is. That's why diamonds are priced less than water. And it depends on who, how wealthy people are. If you chance for money from people who don't like apples compared to tomatoes to people who like apples a lot compared to tomatoes, the price and the free market is going to reflect more of the latter class of people than the former because they've got the money to spend.

Speaker 1:          00:02:39       And so the price of apples is going to go up relative to the price of tomatoes. So those are the three basic lessons of general equilibrium, which we, the first one about laissez faire has a huge implication for what we, whether there should be regulation, but the second pair of implications, uh, you know, what determines the price and price changes as you redistribute wealth and so on. And no just price. That set of ideas you'll see is also going to be very important for finance. So those lessons seem clear. Some of those lessons were understood already by Aristotle, as we said, till the ancients understood supply and demand, at least a little bit of supply and demand. And yet as soon as they moved from apples and oranges to finance, they all got hopelessly confused. So Aristotle said, interest is unnatural. I could go through a lot of people in what they said, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna just leave it at a few, a few quotations.

Speaker 1:          00:03:36       The Bible says interest is terrible. Judaism, um, frowns on interest. Christianity frowns on his interest. Islam frowns on interest. All the great religions of the world crystallizing obviously some of the most important thing. You have the time frowns on interest. So just to remind you of a few. Um, so what, what, what, why do they frown on interest? Well, the idea is that, you know, you do nothing. The lender does nothing and he gets Mac more than he lent to begin with. He's making a profit without having exerted any effort whatsoever. So, so a named Middleton said, in trade, both parties are expected to gain, whereas in lending it usury only the user could profit. So, um, you know, in Deuteronomy, in the Bible, so this is the Jewish Bible. It says, thou shalt not land unusually. That just means interest. That'll show up much lend on usury to thy brother, usually of money, usually evict duals, usually of anything that has lent upon usury.

Speaker 1:          00:04:38       That's all terrible. Of course, unto a foreigner, thou mayest lend upon usury. But unto a brother, thou shalt not lend upon usury. Okay? So the Jews could lend to Christians, but not to each other. So the Christian Church outlawed usury, called it a mortal sin. Luther, for example, says for who? So Lens that he wants it back better or more. That is open and damnable Aaker, those who do that are all daylight, robbers, thieves, and occurs. Those are little Jewish arts and tricks. So, um, there was this antipathy towards usury. And because Jewish money lenders were able to lend to Christians, and there, there was a, an antipathy to Jewish money lenders, which are going to come to when we talk about Shakespeare. So Muslims also forbid, uh, lending. In fact, even today, it's illegal to charge interest in Islamic law. So in my hedge fund we tried to raise money.

Speaker 1:          00:05:36       Uh, I mean there's lots of money in the Middle East so we try and, and most of it, by the way, 10 years ago was invent almost all Middle Eastern money was invested in US government bonds in us stocks, nothing else, like in mortgages for instance. So we, I went to a Saudi Arabia and I meant a bunch of brothers of the king, you know, the Elvis brothers of kings. And I suggest that they invest in our hedge fund and they actually became sort of interested. And so we had to write up a complicated contract. I mean, you know, a mortgage pays interest. So if you invest in the hedge in the hedge fund and the mortgages paying interest, it looks like they're getting interest. And so that wasn't going to do. So we had to write a very elaborate contract, which disguise the fact that interest was being paid and it had to be overseen and a blessed according to Sharia law, by a holy person who was going to verify that there was no interest.

Speaker 1:          00:06:30       Now he charged a fee, which was a percent a year, which looked an awful lot like interest. But anyway, so, so the point is all these religions have banished interest despite the fact that they themselves were involved in interest in lending and borrowing. And so all of it, you know, you just, the world can't function really without lending and borrowing and the charging of interest. But so I don't mean to so, so these religions that for baited at the same time knew that it was going on and uh, allowed it to go on and sometimes participate in it. But the point I'm trying to make is that there was vast confusion. And even today there's confusion because still today the Jewish law doesn't allow for interest between Jews and it's, there's this charade that goes on there just like there is and in Islamic law and just like there is a still frowned upon by the Christian Church.

Speaker 1:          00:07:24       So, um, it's a hard subject to understand. And why is that? Why is it that it's so confusing and how should we understand it? Well Fisher cut through all of this extremely simply. And the way he did it was to, he said, let's just think mathematically then we won't get so tied up in all these religious complexities. Just let's do something mathematical and concrete. So suppose that we consider a problem, which is the one I'm going to work with the rest of the class. Maybe it'd better be over here. So let's say that there are two agents, um, uh, and to goods. So the two goods now or x one and x two. So Fisher's first insight is that let's think of x one and x two is apples, but apples today and Apple's next year, Fisher said, although they're both apples exactly alike, there's no difference between these apples.

Speaker 1:          00:08:19       The apples this year are different goods from the apples next year. So let's move away from apples and tomatoes to apples this year and Apple's next year. So not going to call them goods x and y anymore. I'm going to subscript them by time. So x, these are both ex cause it's the same. Good. But they're, they're different goods because they occur at different time periods. So Fisher said we can incorporate time, uh, simply by having different goods. So of course people he said are going to have some utility, uh, of consuming today versus consuming tomorrow. And let's say this utility is log x one plus half log x two. Okay. For Mr a. So I'm going to come back to this, uh, in half an hour [inaudible] point and explain why Fisher thought that this half made sense. You see this agent a thinks a lot more likes, good one, a lot more than good too. So official would say that's because agent a is impatient and apple is an apple. But if you get it now, it's worth more to you. It gives you a higher utility than getting an apple next year. This is a law of human nature. He claimed, which I'm going to come back to later and it, and uh, that's why people, uh, when you write down the utility function, there's a discount factor, which we're going to add a discount factor, which discounts reduces the utility you get from future consumption. So let's say you B of x one

Speaker 2:          00:09:46       and x two is equal to a log x plus log x too.

Speaker 1:          00:09:54       So B is more patient then a is B actually doesn't discount the future. A does discount the future. So a is impatient, relatively impatient and be as patient.

Speaker 2:          00:10:10       Okay, so then let's make it, they haven't Dauman so e a, let's say the endowment is one zero and um, say it's one, one and an e B. Let's make that a one zero. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:28       But now Fisher wants to talk about finance and he wants to talk about stocks and bonds and interest and all kinds of things. So he says, okay, you know, we've talked about goods with no problem. We can talk about goods today and next year with no problem. Let's talk about stocks. What is a stock? Let's say there two stocks. Okay. Stock Alpha and Stock Beta.

Speaker 1:          00:10:50       So Fisher says, I mean w w what are stocks? I mean there are pieces of paper that you're trading, but they give you ownership of something like a factory or a company or something. And what's good, what good is the company? Well, the good of the companies that it's going to produce something. So let's say that the stock is going to produce something in the future. So we'll call the production of the stock. So what is it? What is the future? It's just X. There's only one. They're only apples in the future. So let's say d

Speaker 2:          00:11:18       two is one and d Beta two equals two.

Speaker 1:          00:11:26       Okay. So Fisher says, uh, you know, you can tell a lot of stories about what the stock does and what, you know, what it's method of production is and you know, what kind of managers that has and a lot of stuff like that. But in the end, people care about the stock because the stock is going to produce something and the value of the stock is going to come from what it produces. So d Alpha two is what people expect the output of the stock to be next year, which is the last year we're worrying about and debated to, which is two is what people expect the stock to produce next year. And we're going to assume that, uh, perfect foresight here. So Fisher says, well, you know, in general people's expectations might be wrong, but let's start off with the case. When people anticipate something, surely they're looking ahead to the future.

Speaker 1:          00:12:13       When deciding whether to buy the stock, we've got to assume something about what they think. Let's suppose they actually get it right and they know what the price of the stock is next period. Okay. So what's going to, uh, what's going to happen? Um, well we can define an economy and presumably the interest rate and the stock prices and all of that are going to come out. Now I should mention, by the way, I forgot to say this, uh, but as I write this down, I suddenly realize, I forgot to mention it. You know, there are other theories of interest to another famous one was Marx's theory of interest. So, uh, this is to be contrasted with Fisher marks. What did Marx say? So in my youth, when I was your age, it was very fashionable to be a Marxist. Um, so every, all of you know, you could almost, anyway, you had to study Marxism.

Speaker 1:          00:13:06       Basically if you wanted to talk to women, you had to know about marks. So anyhow, I dutifully went off and red marks. And so what's the idea of marks? The idea was that uh, he imagined a, an agricultural economy where you plant stuff today and then the output comes out tomorrow. He put corn in, in, in today. Corn comes out tomorrow. So it doesn't require much effort to plant the corn. It requires a lot of effort. You have to buy the corn. So the capitalists would, would buy the corn, but planning it didn't require much effort. However, harvesting it, you know, picking the cotton, you know, picking the chocolate, um, you know, picking all that stuff takes a lot of effort. So in the end you'd get a lot of output. Now when you pick the output, you'd have to pay workers in order to, to pick the output.

Speaker 1:          00:13:55       So Mark's imagine that there was a wage that was arrived at by the struggle between, uh, struggle class struggle between the capitalist and the workers over the subsistence wage. So the subsistence wage was something that resulted subsistence wage resulted from this huge class struggle and um, you know, over time maybe it would rise as, as workers got stronger, but it was still always quite low and the subsistence wage was what the workers would get and what's leftover, which was the surplus. Okay. What was the output being more than what was put in was the surplus part of the surplus would go to the subsistence wage, the rest would go to profit. And so if you look in how much was put in to begin with, you get all the output back out, the same amount of corn you put in plus some extra, you have to give it to the workers and extra you give to uh, the, the, the capitalist gets back at his, at his profit.

Speaker 1:          00:14:55       The fact that the capitalist has done no work at all. He's just bought the corn, let someone else plant it, let someone else harvested, paid all those guys, virtually nothing at the beginning and a lot at the end, he's gotten profit for doing nothing, just like when you lend money. And so this profit, so the profit divided by the initial outlay, that's, that was the rate of interest. And so, uh, Mark's Ed that a capitalist, he could put his money in his bank or he could run this farm and make profit this way. So the money interest in the bank would have to turn out to be the same as this rate of profit. Otherwise he put all the money in the bank. And if it was smaller, he wouldn't, you know, the banks would have to give higher interest in order to attract depositors.

Speaker 1:          00:15:37       So the capitalist profit rate of interest was determined by the rate of profit and the rate of profit was determined by the struggle between capital and labor. Okay. So we've got these religious figures and great philosopher saying, interest is terrible. We've got this great philosopher, economist thing. It's the result of a class struggle. And now we've got Fischer actually marks was pretty mathematical. But now we've got Fisher turning it into a simple math problem and saying, let's reason out the math problem and we'll have the answer to these questions and it'll turn out to be quite different for one. All of these guys are saying, so his, so here's his economy that I just described, the Fisher example, not literally an example he gave, but similar to one he gave. So he said, all right, what happens in this economy? Let's just be very common sensical. What we need to find out now is, is financial like Librium.

Speaker 1:          00:16:36       So financial equilibrium is much more complicated seeming than we had before because we care about the prices. So on, I'm going to use Q for prices. So these are going to be Iq for contemporary prices. Queue contemporary. So the price you pay today to get the apple today, Q two is the price you pay next year to get the apple. Next year they're contemporary prices. Okay. And then, but we, we've got a more I and of course people are going to decide what they want to do. X a one what they're going to end up consuming x eight, two x B one x v two, but now we've got a more complicated world, their stocks to be traded. So, and there's the price of stocks. So p Pi Alpha, I'm running out of letters. I'm going to switch to a Greek one. This is the price of stock. Yay.

Speaker 3:          00:17:31       Stock Alpha

Speaker 1:          00:17:33       and Pi Beta is the price of stock Beta.

Speaker 3:          00:17:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:39       And then we have to know what, what are people going to, how many shares are they going to hold? Well, it's going to be Feta, uh, a is going to hold certain number of shares, Alpha and a is going to hold a certain number of shares of stock Beta and B's going to hold a certain number of shares of Alpha and a certain number of shares of Beta. So we want to solve for all of that. Now I should have said at the beginning if these are trees producing apples, there was an initial stock

Speaker 4:          00:18:08       of, of uh,

Speaker 1:          00:18:09       people owned a certain number of trees, let's say Theta Alpha a. So this is the original ownership, regional ownership of Alpha. Okay, let's just say that. I'll make up some number of, might as well use the same number I thought of before. Let's say that right?

Speaker 4:          00:18:31       And let's say Feta Be Alpha is zero. And let's say Feta bar a Aveda is a half and fade up Barbie of Beta is a half.

Speaker 1:          00:18:47       Okay, so what we've begun, so this is, so the original economy is more complicated than before because we've added stocks, we characterize the stock, we said okay, your stock is a very complicated thing. Accompanies very complicated, depends on managers and processes. And you know, there's all kinds of stuff you think about when you think about a stock. But really at heart, all people are trying to do is forecast what are they going to produce. And so we're going to make it simple mathematically and say, let's say we know what they're going to produce next period. And then people be getting, so let's say it's a tree, everybody knows the Alpha trees producing one apple, the Beta trees producing two, two apples. Alpha happens to own the only alpha tree and Beta and a and B. A owns the Alpha tree, excuse me, and a and B own half each of the Beta tree.

Speaker 1:          00:19:36       Okay, so that's the original economy and the equilibrium is going to be how are they going to, what are the prices going to turn out to be of x one and x two, what are the prices of the tree's going to turn out to be? How much will people consume and how money shares. I mean, because Alpha a began with all of the tree. Maybe he'll sell his shares of tree and ended up with not having a tree in the end. So we have to see where they began, the stock ownership to begin with and where they end up. So that's what we have to solve. All of that. And it looks way more complicated than before and so complicated that you can see why people might have gotten confused, but agreeing to Fisher, it's going to turn out to be a very simple problem in the end once we look at it the right way. So are there any questions about what the economy is and what are the variables that we're trying to explain?

Speaker 5:          00:20:25       Yeah, I can't remember. That says over a Beta Alpha

Speaker 1:          00:20:32       original ownership of stock Alpha and this is original ownership by B of Stock Alpha. This is original ownership by a of stock Beta and this is the original ownership by B of stock Beta original ownership of Alpha.

Speaker 3:          00:20:50       Thanks. Yep. Yes. Let me get my note. These contributing

Speaker 1:          00:20:55       d is the dividend. That's the output that we can all, okay, thank you. I should just write this down. This is

Speaker 3:          00:21:01       the anticipated dividend,

Speaker 1:          00:21:09       which is the output since isn't, that's the end of the world of stock Alpha

Speaker 3:          00:21:15       in period two and

Speaker 1:          00:21:22       Bake d Beta of two is the anticipated dividend of stock Beta in period two. So it's one apple. We're getting out of the Alpha treat two apples out of the Beta tree and we're right. That's what the trees good for. We could look at how beautiful it is. We could, we could talk about how much the owners actually watering the tree. We can talk about a lot of complicated stuff, but in the end, all we care about is how many apples we expect to get out of it. All the eyes of stuff goes into helping us think about how many apples we're going to get out of it and the end. So we cut to the bottom line. What are the apples we expect to get out of the tree? One from the apple tree to from the Beta tree. There was someone else had their hand up.

Speaker 3:          00:22:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:04       Any other questions about the setup? Okay, so we're returning to first principles here. Very simple example. You know, the, uh, when there's ever a big confusion about something important, it's always good to go to first principles. There was a chess player when I was young. They, Mikhail Tal, who is a world champion for a little while and he said that every two or three years he'd go back and read his original, you know, introductory textbooks on chess. Um, so we're going back to the first principles. How would you define equilibrium here for a financial equilibrium? Well, the first thing, you know, it's just common sense. What are people doing at time one? They're going to, what can they do? They can spend money. So let's say, so I'm going to look at the budget set

Speaker 1:          00:22:53       for agent I, you know, and I can be a or B, so I don't have to write it twice. Okay. So he's going to say to himself, let's say a, is he and be as she, he's gonna say, okay, I is he, he's going to say to himself, uh, let's say I can, um, I will say, how much does it cost me to buy goods? Well, the cost of apples is Q1 times. Excellent. That's how many apples I might end up with. Now how much does it cost me to buy shares? It's going to be Pi Alpha Times. How many shares I ended up with Theta Alpha plus Pi Beta

Speaker 3:          00:23:35       trying to stay debater.

Speaker 1:          00:23:37       Hey, so I'm buying goods, I'm buying Alpha shares and I'm buying Beta shares and this is how much I have to spend to get the holdings I want of each. Now where did I get the money to do that? I got the money to do that because I started with my endowment, you know, of goods, which was e one which in this case for a was one unit for B was also one unit. And then I also had shares to begin with of these stocks. So I had feta bar, Alpha plus Pi, Beta Theta Barbido that's, that's in period one. That's what I had to do. I wanted to buy apples shares and I had shares to sell an apples to sell. So that's uh, that's what I did. So of course if x one is bigger than the number of apples I started with, that means I has bought apples cause he ends up with more than he started with. So on net he must've been buying apples. If Theta Alpha is more than of Alpha, alphabet means that Alpha bought shares of stock. Alpha Theta Alpha is less than fate of our alpha. It means Alpha sold shares of stock Alpha.

Speaker 4:          00:24:52       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:24:53       all right. Now in the second period, what happens when the second period we have Q two times x two now nobody, the shares are going to be worthless in period two so no one's going to buy them. Why are the sheriff's worthless? Remember that when you buy a share of stock you, the dividend comes later. You don't get the dividend immediately. So someone buying stock in period two it's too late to get the dividends. It's already gone to the owner who bought the shares and period one. So the, the buyer of a stock gets the dividend, you know, for a month or something. So next period's dividend is still going to go to the buyer in period one. That's why it's valuable to buy shares in period one cause you get next year's apple. Okay? So by next period you can buy the tree, but the world's coming to an end.

Speaker 1:          00:25:42       The tree's not going to do any good. It doesn't produce any more apples. So nobody's going to bother buying shares. I don't have to bother with them. The prices or zero. Okay. And so what income do people have in period two? Well, name got the contemporaneous price times, you know, the apples that somehow they find on the ground that they're, you know, or that their parents are going to leave them when they get old. So that's their endowment of apples. But what else do they have? They've got more apples than that. What else do they have? The dividends. Okay. And so what are the dividends? Well, you bought Theta Alpha to begin with, so that's d alpha too. So if you bought, you know, the whole tree, then you've got all the dividends and similarly with them,

Speaker 4:          00:26:31       Meda, meda, the out the Beta to [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:26:38       Okay, so that's it. So the budget's set is a little more complicated. It's a, so that's the budget.

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       So,

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       hey, so let's got to equality's instead of one. A quality is already, things look a little more complicated now. So an equilibrium is going to happen.

Speaker 4:          00:26:52       The Bay that uh, I chooses x, I want x to Seda, uh, Alpha. You know, I could write a seda I Alfa Feta, I beda

Speaker 1:          00:27:10       it's all the choices he has.

Speaker 4:          00:27:13       Uh, to maximize, ew, I subject to this budget set.

Speaker 1:          00:27:27       Okay, so a is going to pick, you know, what shares to hold, how much to to consume today. And then of course looking forward is going to be able to figure out what he's going to end up consuming tomorrow. All right, so

Speaker 4:          00:27:39       and now in equilibrium we have to have that x a one plus x B one has to equal e a one plus e a e B one. Okay. And x a two. And then, and then we'll do the shares theta. A Alpha plus theta be alpha has equal fader bar, Alpha plus theta bar. The Alpha, right. The stock market has to clear and theta a Beta plus theta B Beta as an equal say to Barb a fade. Huh? Let's say the bar be bait. Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:28:20       Hazel in period one, the demand for apples has to equal the supply of all the agents. Okay. But now what's the last equation? This is a little trickier. What's the last step?

Speaker 4:          00:28:30       Equation x. A two plus x. B two equals e Ey two plus e be too. Is that it?

Speaker 1:          00:28:44       No, there's something else. So though the dip, the apples are right. The total consumption of apples is going to be the apples that they have on the ground, but also the ones that were picked off the trees. So these dividends, so it's going to be the total dividends,

Speaker 4:          00:29:01       switcher Theta Bar, a Alpha plus Beta bar B Alpha Times that tree, the Alpha two plus fade up bar a Beta plus Theta Bar B Beta Times d beta.

Speaker 1:          00:29:24       Okay, so, so just to say it in words, it's exactly what we had before except we have to take into account in addition to the goods market clearing, we have to take into account that the stock market has to clear and in the end, demand for goods has to equal the supply that people had in their endowments, but also what the companies are producing. These companies are producing output, you know, apples. And so that's part of what's the consumption is going to be in the economy. Okay. Are you with me here as a good time for questions? Maybe? Yes.

Speaker 5:          00:30:01       Could you just explain again why you don't pick stocks?

Speaker 1:          00:30:06       Okay. So in period two you might wonder Pi Alpha is the price of a stock at period one stock Alpha in period one Pi Beta is the price of the stock Beta in period one. How come I didn't write down list price of the stocks and period two and keep track of what they're holding in period two and the reason is that when you buy a stock, you're buying it not for the dividends at the same moment in time, you don't get those dividends. The guy who already had it gets those dividends. When you buy the stock, you're buying it for the future dividends you can get. And I have assumed the world's going to end after two periods cause nobody's utility, you know, cares about period three. So if you buy the stock in period two it's too late for you to get anything. There are no dividends because peer, you could only get them in period three and there won't be any dividends in period three.

Speaker 1:          00:30:58       And if there were, you wouldn't care about them anyway, so the stock is worthless to you. So the price of the stock in period two of both stocks is going to be zero. So there's no point in putting down what people are buying of the stocks are selling or anything. It's just not worth anything. But in general, you're right. And we're going to be more complicated, uh, later when you look at your income from having bought the stocks you'll have as your income, the dividends from the stocks plus the resale value of the stock, because you could sell the stock next period. But I just know the resale value is going to be zero because you're in the last period of the economy. Okay. And I just want to keep it very simple this first time. So you, it, you could, yeah. So we'll see, you know, step by step, you'll be able to keep very complicated things in your head, but not right the first. Yeah. So any other questions? Yes.

Speaker 5:          00:31:44       Why are there,

Speaker 1:          00:31:50       you mean why do people, um, having endowments today and next year because you could think of the endowment for example as here we've got apples but usually the endowment is your labor. So you can work this year. What have you most important endowment is your energy and your labor. So you've got it this year. Next year if you're still alive you're going to, that's new labor that you have. It's a different good. So it's a second endowment that you have. So you know, I don't want to get caught up in labor and all that and get involved with marks again. So I'm just going to talk about apples. Do you have an endowment of apples when you're young and next year somehow you're going to have more apples. So you could think of the, you might have thought that the only apples next year coming from what the firms are producing. But you know, I've allowed for the possibility that people have apples too, just like their labor next year. Okay. Other questions?

Speaker 5:          00:32:42       Yeah, we didn't have to be fine. He to a youtube, the first few then downs or are they, is that sort of implied?

Speaker 1:          00:32:52       Well, this is a, this is e h I should written this more carefully. Maybe e and e eight is that, and this is e B one and B two is that,

Speaker 5:          00:33:09       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:33:14       So as he was suggesting back there, I have assumed for person B that you know, he's got an apple now somehow the world, you know, we, we aren't modeling what happened to get us here. The guy got an apple today. They both have an apple today. Somehow A's also going to have another apple tomorrow. That a, you know, he's going to find under his doorstep somehow that isn't being produced by the tree. And maybe you can think of it as Labor that he's gonna have next period.

Speaker 5:          00:33:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:41       All right. So that's it. Fisher says, as soon as you write down the economy, mathematically, all sorts of things are going to occur to you, which if you're talking in words about justice and injustice, you know you're going to be lost. So what, what, what can we get right away out of this? Uh, what can we get right away out of this? Well, the first thing is how would we define inflation? What is inflation? What's inflation? And this economy, assuming we've got the equilibrium, which we're going to get soon, we're going to calculate it, but right now we don't know what the numbers, you know, we've got a bunch of equations and stuff. We don't know what x a one in Q one and Q two are going to turn out to be, but we're gonna find out very soon. But before we find out, assuming we've gotten those, what will inflation B, what is inflation?

Speaker 5:          00:34:40       Yup.

Speaker 1:          00:34:46       Well, we're talking about inflation. When you talk about the consumer price index inflation, what are they talking about?

Speaker 5:          00:34:52       Yup.

Speaker 1:          00:34:54       Okay. So inflation is just Q two over Q one, right? So that's the price of apples today. It's the price of apples next year. If the price of apples next year is bigger than this year, we've got inflation. If it's lower, we've got deflation. Okay, so already the model, you're talking about inflation. Okay, what else? What's the next most obvious? Uh,

Speaker 5:          00:35:16       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:17       Okay, well I think I'm going to skip a bunch of stuff and get now to the key idea. He idea is arbitrage.

Speaker 1:          00:35:27       Okay. So Fisher says people have, you know, they have four sites. They're anticipating what the dividends are going to be. They, they, they, they can, you know, they that, you know, you can talk about how beautiful the tree is and how much you like the owners and how much they're watering it and all kinds of, what do they have a good plan for irrigation and you know, whether they did well in college and stuff like that. But in the end, all you care about the trees is what, how many apples they're going to produce. So knowing that, can we say something about Pi Alpha versus Pi Nedo enact delivery, what's going to have to happen? They're going to be some connection. And what's the connection going to be? You've got two trees.

Speaker 3:          00:36:12       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:36:15       Right. So Pi Alpha is going to be Pi Beta at times d. Um, uh, let's see. Pi Out. Okay. So Alpha will be better as long as the,

Speaker 3:          00:36:32       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:33       Oh, I haven't got, I've got that in the right order. If, and so in this case, Pi Alpha is going to equal a half Pi Beta because Alpha is producing half the dividend, the Betas producing. So obviously it's going to turn out to have half the price that that's the fundamental principle. Okay. We're doing it in the most trivial case, but so most fundamental principle of finance that he's, we've got two assets and one of them, they're basically the same up to scale. Then their prices have to be the same up to scale. Who's going to bother to buy alpha if it costs three times, if it costs, you know, the same amount as Beta when it only produces half as much.

Speaker 3:          00:37:15       Okay. Yes. Same thing. Same thing.

Speaker 1:          00:37:19       Well it is something like that, but that's a word that we haven't defined yet. So we're going to define it in the next class. So it's something like that. Yup. Any other, okay, so that is a very simple thing now. So polls I added. Suppose I added, okay, so here's, here's a a suppose I added. Suppose after finding the equilibrium, I added a third asset

Speaker 3:          00:38:03       acid that paid

Speaker 1:          00:38:07       oh $1

Speaker 3:          00:38:11       period. Two next year.

Speaker 1:          00:38:15       Okay, now it would have a price. I've added a third acid gamma. Then what? So Pi Gamma, we'd have to solve for the equilibrium pie gamma, and is there some word that I could use? How could I, so gamma is an asset that pays a dollar in period two. It's a bond promising a dollar in period two. The price of the bond would then have to be what? One over one plus I where I is called the nominal interest rate. So we've got inflation is occurring in the model. If I added a bond, which I didn't bother to do because it's just yet another thing I'd have to write down, I could've had a third acid, which pays a dollar. So the others are paying off in an apples. This one's paying a dollar and it's priced today. You know, if you pay 80 cents today, it's like saying I'm paying 80 cents today, I'm getting a whole dollar tomorrow. So it's like a 25% rate of interest. Okay. Because another way of saying it is that I put in Pike, you know, so one over Pi Gamma's one plus I, I put only Pi Gammon today. I get one out tomorrow. So I've gotten back not only the Pi Gam I put in, but something extra. That's one plus the interest rate. Okay? So the, the this world is going to have an interest rate in and he's going to have inflation in it

Speaker 1:          00:39:45       with me so far. All right. So now Fisher makes his most important. Okay. So let me add one more thing. I could come back to this. So I said that I said that, um,

Speaker 3:          00:39:59       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:59       I said that if you take Feta Alpha less than fader Bar Alpha, it means you're selling the stock. So I'm going to allow people to go even further Theta Alpha less than zero. Okay? So let me just write that again. Theta Alpha less than fader Bar Alpha means means, uh, selling

Speaker 3:          00:40:24       Alpha Feta Alpha

Speaker 1:          00:40:26       less than zero is doing a lot more than selling you. You don't have it to begin with. So how can you, what are you selling? Well, the mathematics is telling you that over here they'd Alpha's going to be negative. You've got your, instead of getting extra dividends, you're going to be giving up dividends because it's going to reduce your supply of money. So Theta Alpha, less than zero is called selling short.

Speaker 3:          00:40:57       Know which one I've lost. That'd be bad.

Speaker 1:          00:41:16       Okay, so you're, you're, uh, if you can still hear me, you're selling short. This means AC. You're selling something you don't even, you don't even have, or it's also called making selling. It's also called making a promise without collateral. Okay? So I'm going to for now allow for that. So we're not taking into account that anybody's defaulted. If you take Feta Alpha negative, it means your income in the future is going to be reduced because you're going to have to deliver the dividend because you're going to have negative dividends, which means effectively you take out of your endowment those dividends and hand them over. So it's so it's as if you always keep your promises. So this model, so far, the official model assumes no default, no collateral. We're not worrying about any of that stuff. Okay? And of course that's going to be a critical thing. So,

Speaker 5:          00:42:24       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:42:24       you see some things happen that we never happen had happened before. In the past, you traded money for a football ticket, you gave up something you wanted, you got something, uh, that you also wanted. It was a trade of value for value. Everybody agreed the two things you traded are equally valuable. If you take Feta Alpha negative by taking Theta Alpha negative, hey, that becomes a negative number here. So it allows you to spend more, you can buy more goods by taking Feta Alpha negative, that's negative. That means this can be more positive and still satisfy this constraint. So by selling a stock short, you're, you're promising to do something in the future, you get more money now you can eat more now. And then of course you have to consume less than the future cause you have to pay back your promise. So you're exchanging something valuable.

Speaker 1:          00:43:11       You're you, you know you're getting money. Something valuable in exchange for a promise, which is worth nothing until the future. When you deliver on your promise, when you buy the stock, you know you're buying part of the tree, but the trees doing nothing for you. Now you're doing it because it's going to be valuable. Next period, you're actually not physically owning the tree. You're owning a piece of paper that gives you a right to have the dividends of the tree. So you're getting something that's only good because it's a promise you think has been kept. Okay, so so far we're going for the next few lectures. We're going to ignore the fact that people get very nervous when they give something up that's valuable in exchange for something. That was just a promise. What? Okay, so a critical thing has happened here. So we've kept the same mathematics, except we've surreptitiously added this huge assumption. Now Fisher said, having done that, what can you realize? This is the most important insight. He said, this model, it looks so complicated. It looks like now we have vastly more equations, no wonder marks and all those religious zealots. We're getting confused, you know, uh, we can simplify it all and be back to where we were before and yet talk about finance. So Fisher introduced the idea of present value prices.

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       Okay? So he said, look, when you buy a stock, what are you really doing? This is the principle of arbitrage. She says, when you buy a stock, you're saying to yourself, I'm giving up money today. Now money today is consumption. Because I would have used that money if I didn't buy stocks, I would've bought apples today and eating them. So when I buy a stock, I'm giving up apples. Today I'm getting the stock, which is then paying me dividends tomorrow, which whatever they are, I'm selling off. You know, I'm, I'm getting a profit out of the stock tomorrow and an Emmet, I'm ending up with Apple's tomorrow. Maybe I'm just eating the dividends straight off the tree. So when I buy a stock, I'm really giving up apples today and getting apples tomorrow. And no matter how I do it, whether it's through stock Alpha or through stock Beta or through a nominal bond, it's got to be the case that all three ways or all 50 other ways you could imagine doing it half to give me the same trade off.

Speaker 1:          00:45:30       This is your yield. You were talking about the same trade off. The amount of apples I effectively give up today in order to get apples tomorrow is going to be the same. No matter which way I do it. If it weren't the same, if, if Alpha is price was more than a half of Betas, nobody would buy alpha. In fact, they would start selling alpha. Okay? So that's why this assumption is so important. What would they do? Not only with nobody by Alpha, but they start selling it. They'd say, well, Alpha is so expensive. Uh, you know, let's say it's the same price as Beta. I can sell Alpha with every elf I sell. I can buy stock Beta. And so I haven't done anything today, but in the future I've got stock Beta, which is paying me to, I owe because I sold stock Alpha Short I oh one.

Speaker 1:          00:46:17       So I'll pay off the one I, oh and I'll still be left with one. I'm making an arbitrage profit and so I'm not going to stop. It's selling one share of Alpha, also two shares of apple, then three shares of Alpha, then a million shares of Alpha and everybody will be sewing, uh, Alpha short to by Beta. And, and uh, you know, the market for Alpha will never clear. So that's why the price is we'll have to adjust. And so it can't be, it has to be an equilibrium. And the price of Alphas, exactly the height, half the price of Beta, which is to say in short, that if you solve for this equilibrium, you can solve for an equilibrium where,

Speaker 2:          00:46:49       um, p one equals Q one is the price today of an apple today. And P two is the price today, why it's called present value price price today of an apple next year.

Speaker 1:          00:47:17       Hey, so if you've got this equilibrium by, by working your way through, you know, by figuring out what the price of Alpha is. A, so the stock for example, you want to figure out what the, what the stock is supposed to stock of Alpha. Suppose the price turns out to be a half, okay. Then by paying a half today, you can buy stock Alpha, which is going to pay you a whole dividend. Okay? So the price, therefore have an entire, oh, let's do bait. I suppose the price of Betas is a, is a, is a quarter. Okay. Suppose we happened to find out that the price of Beta is a quarter. Then what's p two? How much do you have to give up today in order to get an apple? Well, by paying a quarter today, that's the price. By paying a quarter today, you're getting to dividends. So by paying a quarter today, you're getting to dividends.

Speaker 1:          00:48:12       If you paid to get one dividend, you'd have to pay an eighth today. So the price, um, p two would be an eighth in that case. Okay? So by, by looking piercing through the veil of the stock market, you can always figure out what you're effectively paying today in order to get an apple next period. And that price, which we just computed would be the same whether we looked at it from the point of view of going through stock Beta or through stock alpha through a nominal bond. And it always have to give us the same answer. So we know from the financial equilibrium we can deduce what p one and p two have to be the present value prices. And so effectively, furthermore,

Speaker 2:          00:48:56       uh, stocks the fact of late, just add to the endowment some goods. Okay. So, um, we can now consider another economy. So let's consider the economy he hat. So the economy, the hat economy, so you hat of x one and x two a is the same as it was before. You pay x one x two, you had me of x one and x two is the same as it was before, but the endowments now he had a won, he had a two. She was going to be what?

Speaker 1:          00:49:46       Oh Hey. Over here began with one unit of each chord, but a also own all of stock Elfa and half we'll start Beta. So all of stock Alpha pays one dividend the future. So really a effectively has claim on two apples in the future and another half of Beta, which is another apple in the future. So really a initial endowment of goods is one. Three. Okay. How did I get that? Again, I said it was one apple to begin with. He could anticipate having, he knew he owned all the stock Alpha. Okay. Which pays one apple. So that's another one. That's his and some in the future he's going to get half of the of the dividends or stock Beta and half of two was also once he's got three apples in the field.

Speaker 2:          00:50:35       Sure. And Beta B, I'm sorry, he had beat to, well his one doesn't change today, but how many, what's his claim effectively on dividends in the future.

Speaker 3:          00:50:50       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:50:55       One thank you. Somebody answered that. Um, so we've now reduced the financial equilibrium to a general equilibrium, the same kind of economy that we had before.

Speaker 1:          00:51:09       It's just that we had to augment the endowments to take into account that people own stuff through the stocks. Okay, so what's the equilibrium of this economy? This equilibrium has, this has a simple general like Librium. Okay, so what is it? How do we solve for x?

Speaker 2:          00:51:25       Librium well, take p one equal to one and we'll solve for P two. So let's just clear the first market. How do you clear it?

Speaker 1:          00:51:39       You're with me here. There's a standard general. Luckily we're in the same kind we've done many times before. So

Speaker 2:          00:51:45       I'll see if I can do it. So person one is going to spend a third of his money. And how much money does he have? He has p one time. So he has one plus p two times three that's a

Speaker 1:          00:52:01       right, isn't dominant, is one three. This is his income and he's spending a third of it on good one. And the price of,

Speaker 2:          00:52:07       go ahead. One P one. Okay, here it's just one and then B is going to spend. He's a half half Cobb. Doug with sky. So this is one and this is one. He's spending half of his money in his income is one plus p two times one divided by one and that has to equal the total endowment, which is two one plus one. So did I go too fast? I, yes. Well it's probably wrong. So let's see if I, let's try it again. You have, maybe it's two thirds. Okay, so let's try, uh, let's see what I was, he's

Speaker 1:          00:52:48       doing. I'm saying here are the, I've taken the financial economy, which was very complicated, looks very hard to solve and Fisher says, you know, of course when we add uncertainty and things like that, we're going to have to do other tricks. But without uncertainty, with perfect foresight and so on, and no one certainty, Fisher says, this is an easy problem to solve. You take the financial equilibrium with all its extra variables and you realize that people are rational. They're going to see through all that complicated stuff. They're going to realize that Alpha is just half as good as Beta. And so they're going to realize that by holding stock, they're making a certain trade off between Alpha and Beta. And we calculated the trade off p two was going to equal p two p two was going to be, what was p two I forgot what Pete two was anyway. The the car. How much did you have to pay? Okay, if you pay high alpha divided by d alpha two something like that was p two because by um,

Speaker 1:          00:53:52       okay, so if, if it costs you a certain amount of money and you get, you know, if it costs you a quarter, we said, and you get a, this was bay, so this is p two. So through either stock, like bait is the one I solved it for. I said, suppose Beta, it's also equal to Pi Alpha or ruddy alpha two we said if the price of Beta turns out to be a quarter and you're getting to dividends than by paying a quarter, you get to dividends. So it means to get one apple only cost you on eighth so affect an eighth of a dollar. So p two we could figure out. So once we've got our financial equilibrium, it basically is determining a general equilibrium. So instead, so let's go backwards. Instead of solving for the financial live in that looks complicated. Let's solve for the general equilibrium.

Speaker 1:          00:54:38       What is the effect of general equilibrium? It's the same utilities as before, but we've augmented the endowments according to by looking through the veil of the stocks. We realize that a actually owns three apples in the future. One because he owns all stock Alpha and another one because he owns half of stock Beta. So we've got the simple economy that we're used to solving that you did on the first problem set so we can do it again and solve it. So I'm going to, I'm going to now solve for general equilibrium. I have to solve for p one and p two and all the [inaudible] but I can fix one of the prices to be one. So I'll fix p one to be one. Then what does a do? So I made a mistake, which is why you weren't following me a his Cobb Douglas, two thirds of the weight is on good one and one third on good to, so he's going to spend two thirds of his money on the first God.

Speaker 1:          00:55:28       So that's why this should have been a two thirds that she pointed out. Thank you. So two thirds of his money. What's his money's endowment is one. Three. So it's p one times one which is one times one plus three times p two divided by the price. P one two thirds of the income divide by the price of the first chord. That's how many the first god he wants to eat. What does she want to do? She's going to spend, she's patient. She's going to spend half our income on both goods. So half of her income, which is one plus p two times one divided by one. That's so many apples today. She wants and that's what we have to clear to clear the apple market at time one. So it's, this makes sense now.

Speaker 3:          00:56:11       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:56:11       I'm looking at you in the front. Do you, would you agree with this or is this confusing now?

Speaker 3:          00:56:17       Good. Does this make? Yep.

Speaker 1:          00:56:21       Okay. Someone else all, so do you this or is this confusing? I can say it again if it's confusing.

Speaker 5:          00:56:25       Yeah. Did nominator represents what they want.

Speaker 1:          00:56:31       Okay. Remember how the Cobb Douglas Work? This is the, this is this trick I'm going to use over and over again with log utilities. Everybody will spend depending on the coefficient. So remember this utility and the problem set, you know that this utility is just the same as if I put two thirds here and one third here, right? Cause I'm just multiplying and dividing this by three. So instead of one and a half. So the originally utility is this,

Speaker 5:          00:57:01       right? It's a,

Speaker 1:          00:57:04       it's log x plus one half log x two. So the, some of these things is three. The sum of this plus this is three halves. I can multiply by two thirds. So I've been multiply this by two thirds. I get two thirds here and one third here, right? And I haven't changed the utility function. And now I know this is a familiar pattern. A is always going to spend two thirds of his money on the first short,

Speaker 5:          00:57:28       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:30       And B, I could multiply this whole utility by a half and a half and B is going to spend and now we recognize it as the common top dog, his thing. And we could say that A's going to spend half his money in the first good and half his money on the second court. Okay, so what have I done? Fisher said, look, this model is so complicated. You're thinking in your heads people are deciding and period one, how much stock should I buy? How many bonds should I buy? How many apples should I eat? But really if they're smart, they're not going to think that way. They're going to say to themselves, how many apples should I buy today? How many apples do I want to consume tomorrow? All these financial assets are just methods for me getting apples tomorrow in exchange for apples today. And what's the trade off between?

Speaker 1:          00:58:15       The apples was the s p one and p two is the tradeoff between apples. You could look through the stocks and all that, but no matter which stock you think of buying, there's going to be the same trade off between apples today and Apple's tomorrow cause of of the no arbitrage. You know the price of Alpha's going to have to be exactly half the price of Beta. So if I, once I saw for this economy and get the price of Alpha, I'll know how many apples today I have to trade off in order to get apples tomorrow. So I might as well forget about all the stocks and just try to figure out what must that trade off between p one and p two B. Okay, so that's why you can forget about the stocks. Forget about the bonds. Everybody's thinking, I'm trading off apples today for Apple's next year.

Speaker 1:          00:59:01       I'll make you over trades today because I'm trading apples today in exchange for promises for Apple's next period. So it's as if everything happens today. It's as if they're present value prices today. We trade today at prices p one and p two for apples today and Apple's next year. Of course the apples won't appear till next year, but I can sell an apple today at price p one and by promises for apple next year at a price p two and that's the trade off I'm facing. If I faced that trade off, how much of my money am I going to spend on apples today? I'm going to spend two thirds of my money on apples today and the other third I'll spend on promises for Apple's next period. Okay, so I mean this is a big insight Fisher had. It's not surprising. It's a little puzzling. I'm so used to it that I forgotten how puzzling it is. So, well, ask me some more questions. This was not an obvious thought Fisher had. Yup.

Speaker 5:          00:59:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:58       Okay. The price, often there'll be inflation, so Q2 the contemporaneous price next period might be higher than the contemporary and is priced this period. But we don't care about that. What we care about is how many apples you have to give up today in order to get apples tomorrow. So that's called the present. So p two is the present value price. What do you have to give up today to get the apple next period? So we expect [inaudible] to be less than p one

Speaker 5:          01:00:27       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:28       Precisely because what we're going to come to that, that's the next thing I was going to talk about because everybody's putting more weight on consumption today than they are in consumption in the future. That's why the price p one is going to be bigger than the price Pete too.

Speaker 5:          01:00:41       Yup.

Speaker 1:          01:00:44       So we're solving for p one and P two and present value prices. Okay? So the crucial thing is he invented this term, present value prices, the prices you paid today, no matter when you're going to get the stuff. That's his big insight. You should look at present value prices, holding stocks and all that complicated stuff is just giving you goods in the future. So when you buy the stocks today, you should think, how much am I having to pay today to get an apple in the future? You can deduce that from the price of stocks and how many dividends they're paying. So everybody must have figured out a p two what does it cost today? How much money do I have to give up today to get a PR an apple in the future? Well, I have to buy a stock and then sell the dividends and all that. But really what I should be thinking about is what's the price today I'm paying for one apple in the future and that's p two. And so when you think about it that way, although it's an intertemporal problem, it looks like a new model with time. Fisher said you can reduce it as if they're thinking of it as if they're just the same problem we did before with two goods. You're trading at the same time. That's not an obvious thing to a thought of. No one thought of it before him. Yup.

Speaker 5:          01:02:03       Oh

Speaker 1:          01:02:04       absolutely. So this should have been a Q two here because you, you sell the dividend, you can get money by selling the dividend. Thank you. Oh Ho Ho. Very good. Who Said who said that? I'd have to who just asked that question? Are you the okay,

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       I'll remember you. That was very good. Exactly. So in the future, you're getting the money for. So what he pointed out is, I made another mistake here in the future. The money you're spending on goods in the future, you're going to get the dividends paid. Of course you can sell the dividends for money and the price is Q two. So a Kutu has to appear over here, just like there's a Q two over there. So it's the goods times the price. That's the money you're getting in the future. And that's the money you're spending on the good x too.

Speaker 5:          01:02:50       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:02:51       very good. Too bad you didn't ask me that a while ago. But anyway. Okay. Any other questions? Okay, so we're back to this standard general equilibrium problem. We can take a financial equilibrium and turn it into a general equilibrium. And so when we solve this, we're going to have two thirds plus p two plus one half plus one half two equals two. So, um, looks like three halves. Nope, I haven't done this wrong. P two equals um, to my two thirds plus two P two. Thank you. Yeah, I'll put two P two. Okay. So we have to be two plus a half plus a half be too. So we have five halves Pete too. That was lucky you caught that five halves p two. And then over here we have two minus. Uh, so two thirds is four six and three. Six is nine six and 12 six minus nine six is uh,

Speaker 2:          01:04:04       what is this? So what's two minus two thirds minus a half five. Six that's correct. Okay, so p two therefore equals one third. All right. So we've now solved for equilibrium. We know that p one is gotta be one p two has gotta be one third. We know that, um, we can figure out what consumption's going to be. I mean x a one for example, if we wanted to solve for that, we just plug in a third here. So we'd have two thirds times one plus three, which is two thirds times of four, which is eight thirds I guess. Okay. And you know, eggs be one we can solve for that too. If we wanted to. X B one is going to be a half times four thirds, which is two thirds. That doesn't, okay. A half plus. What was this one third. So it's one plus one third, which is four thirds times a half, which is two thirds. Is that right?

Speaker 5:          01:05:14       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:05:15       Oh that doesn't look right. So maybe I did this

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       wrong. One plus one plus one is two. So this is four thirds. That looks better. Okay. Four thirds x a one is four thirds XP one is two thirds. Okay. So we have four thirds and two thirds. And so we could solve similarly for x eight two and SB two which I won't bother to do. So we can figure out what the prices are, the present value prices in the present daily consumption. But having done that, Fisher says, okay, we took a hard problem. You made it easy. Let's go back to the hard problem. Can we? Okay. So Fisher says the tradeoff between good one and good to is one, two, a third. So he defined, here's the nominal rate of interest. Fisher defined something called the real rate of interest and he said that was a variable that you should pay a lot of attention to. So the real rate of interest he said is um, p one divided by Pete too.

Speaker 1:          01:06:19       So this is equal to three and so r is 200% okay, so why did I get that? Just as someone in the front sad, the good too is much less expensive. The present value of good too is much less than the present value of good one people. Like people think an apple today is much more valuable than an apple tomorrow. So if you give up an apple today, you can get three apples next year, just like if you put it. So if you put an apple in the bank, it's like getting 200% interest on apples. So he called it the real rate and the apple rate of interest, you put an apple in the bank, you know, you give up an apple today, buy stocks, and when it comes out in the end, you've got 200% more apples than you started with. So it's the wheel rate of interest. Okay, so that's his crucial variable. Now let's go back to the original equilibrium. What is the stock price? Assume now that cue, assume Q one equals one. Okay. What is the stock price? Pi Alpha. Okay, well we can figure it out. How can we figure it out? What is Pi Alpha? Wild Stock Alpha pays one good tomorrow.

Speaker 3:          01:07:40       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:07:40       so what is the price?

Speaker 3:          01:07:42       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:07:43       of five Lc.

Speaker 3:          01:07:48       What?

Speaker 1:          01:07:49       Somebody said it, I couldn't hear it. A third. How did I get a third? Because we figured out that once everybody looks through the veil, assuming the price, p one is one and the price Q one is one. If they look through the veil, they're going to say to themselves, ah Ha, how much do I have to pay today to get an apple in the future? I have to pay a third to get one apple in the future. P One is times p two so to get one app on the future is only a third of an apple today. So the stock pays one apple in the future. So therefore, how much do I have to pay today? I have to pay one third of an apple today. And since I took the price of apples to be one, it's going to be the price of one third. So what's the price? Beta? Two thirds. Okay. So Fisher said, look, we've solved now for all these financial things. Okay, so

Speaker 3:          01:08:44       all right,

Speaker 1:          01:08:46       so what you can't do Fisher's theory,

Speaker 3:          01:08:50       Fisher's theory does not explain how much, uh, how much of each stock, stock, Feta, a et Cetera, uh, the investors hold.

Speaker 1:          01:09:14       Why is that? Well, because it doesn't matter. That's not enough is happening in the economy yet. Alpha and Beta are exactly the same. If you own twice as much of the Alpha tree, you get exactly the same as having the Beta tree. So how can you possibly tell whether somebody is going to hold twice the Alpha tree or just one Beta tree? Either way, he's going to get the same thing. So the theory can't possibly explain which one they're going to do. Somehow they'll, they'll work it out and the divide up the tree so that everybody ends up with the right number of apples in the end. And it also does not explain, does not explain inflation.

Speaker 3:          01:09:54       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:09:56       Okay. Because you can't tell what Q two is going to be. All right, because you see in this budget set, thanks to that inspired question. If you double Q two Q two appears everywhere, you're not going to change the second equation. So Q two could be anything and it uh, you're, you know, you can double it or triple it. It won't matter. Okay. So cute. And the same with Q1. It's just like vol. Ross said before, you can always normalized prices to be one. So the, so the theory, you know, if he had, he had to add another theory of money and how many dollars were floating around in the economy to explain Q2 this theory won't explain it. So it does not explain inflation and it does not explain, um, who holds which stock. And so it does not explain the nominal rate of interest does not explain, hi, the nominal rate of interest cause $1. Who knows what $1 is going to be worth. It depends on how much inflation we have. But it does explain the real rate of interest does explain are, and that's the variable that Fisher sends the one economists should always pay attention to. The real rate of interest. Hey, so that's the crucial variable. So if you want to figure out what's the price today of a stock. So Fisher's famous equations, the price of a stock today.

Speaker 1:          01:11:24       Okay, so Pi Alpha divided by Q one. So the real price as somebody said, the price and terms of gods of the stock today is always going to equal the dividend in the future divided by one plus r a why is that? That's exactly what we already used. Okay. This is just a rewriting of the trick we did before. You take the stock tomorrow and you multiple it, so you just, you take the dividend tomorrow, you multiply it by p two okay. And then you realize that one plus r is just p one divided by p two so replacing the p ones and p twos by Q one and one plus R. Today's real stock price is just the dividends tomorrow discounted. This is what he called the fundamental theorem, fundamental theorem of asset pricing.

Speaker 1:          01:12:20       So if you knew the real rate of interest, you'd be able to figure out what all the stocks were worth just by just like we did, you know, once we knew p one and p to the present value, the present value prices determine the interest rate because they're just, as we said, p one over p two remember it's one plus r, so knowing p one and p two you're always normalizing p one two B one that's the Saint Peter's the same as one over one plus r. So if you know p two or you know one of one plus R, you know what the value of the stocks are. That's as critical insight. Now just to finish in third yes,

Speaker 3:          01:12:57       Q one

Speaker 1:          01:12:59       he won, which is the same as p one you know, because it's today's price in both the contemporaneous price today is the present value of price today.

Speaker 3:          01:13:11       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:13:12       so let me just end on this one. Node Fisher said, okay, we can take financial equilibrium without uncertainty, reduce it to channel equilibrium. We know everything about general equilibrium. Therefore, we know everything about financial equilibrium and we realized that the crucial variable in general equilibrium is relative prices. There is no just interest rate. The nominal interest rate. Who the hell cares? The real interest rate is what we care about and just be calm. And Justin, normal economics, there's no just relative price. There's no just real interest rate. It depends on people's utilities. You make the more patient and the, you know, and that's going to affect the real interest rate and make them less patient. It's going to affect the real industry. You'll give them more endowments today versus tomorrow. That's going to affect the real interest rate, the relative price between today and tomorrow. That's the way you should think about finance. That's the way you should explain what's going on in the financial markets. So in the problem set, you're just going to do a problem like that. And then I'm going to give more interpretations of this that Fisher gave. So I guess I'm out of time. So I'll just stop here.
