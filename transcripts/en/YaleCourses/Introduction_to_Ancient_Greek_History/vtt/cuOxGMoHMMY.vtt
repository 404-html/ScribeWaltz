1
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.190
I have a title for today's talk.

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.210
I call it slip Damascus's and the fall of the polis and I read that to you

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.250
because it's always useful to remember that while we you look back on these

4
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:19.251
events and know their outcome and can assign to them a special significance

5
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:20.850
let's never forget.

6
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.090
They didn't know that they were on the brink of the end of the independent polls

7
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.610
and it was very much in fact I'm sure if you if you came along and 362 after

8
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:36.960
that battle it would never ever occurred to you that that whole fundamental

9
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:41.961
arrangement of the world that had been sort of in place to some degree perhaps

10
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:48.801
as far back as the 8th century was going to change its character very sharply

11
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.780
and that although there would still be plays that would be going on it might

12
00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:58.590
seem in the same old way even after the Macedonian conquest.

13
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.220
The fact was that none of them ever again really was autonomous in the sense of

14
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:10.500
to be fully in control of its own fate both in terms of the internal

15
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.860
constitution and also more importantly or at least the one that was most in

16
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:21.471
danger the capacity to engage in international relations freely and to be free

17
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:24.960
to make their own foreign policy.

18
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.990
So as I say it's going to be a very major change but it's something that they

19
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:35.350
don't know.
They're in the middle of watching well.

20
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.550
In 359

21
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.420
man called Philip became king of Macedonia Macedon which is we know where the

22
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:52.420
Macedonians were fundamentally Greeks.

23
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.440
That is to say they were Greek speakers and ethnically if you can if there is

24
00:01:59.101 --> 00:01:59.934
such a thing.

25
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.150
They were Greek but they were so far out of the mainstream of the development of

26
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:11.880
the Greek police that we have been examining this semester that many many Greeks

27
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:16.881
perhaps most of them didn't think of them as being Greek when Greeks thought

28
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:23.790
about what it was to be a Greek they thought about more than the fact that they

29
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:28.650
spoke the Greek language they thought fundamentally if you get to Aristotle you

30
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:33.651
see how thoroughly true this is it had to do with our culture or way of life and

31
00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:37.440
that way of life was based upon the independent polls.

32
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.520
Well Macedon did not have such a structure Macedon the Greeks called the

33
00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:48.891
Macedonians an ethnic loss a tribal group is what that sort of means something.

34
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.400
We use the words sort of nation somehow to translate ethnic ethnics but it and

35
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.413
that's OK.

36
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.060
The word nation itself remember comes from the Latin word which means to be born

37
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.620
and people who are born of the same stock.

38
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.200
But for the Greeks that it had a different meaning it was people who

39
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.500
participated in the culture that they designated as Hellenic and they thought

40
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.900
the Macedonians fell outside of that there were no place in the Macedonian

41
00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:22.284
kingdom.

42
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.730
It was something that we might call feudal that is to say yes there was a

43
00:03:26.731 --> 00:03:31.731
monarch but there were powerful noblemen who were practically independent and

44
00:03:33.451 --> 00:03:38.400
who owed only a limited allegiance to the king and who were really the dominant

45
00:03:38.401 --> 00:03:43.401
figures in the state for most of the history prior to the appearance of Phillip.

46
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.600
On the other hand the King was an important and powerful character so that you

47
00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:52.950
have this this was true of European feudal states at certain periods in their

48
00:03:52.951 --> 00:03:53.784
development.

49
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.690
On the one hand the fundamental society was based upon great lords great

50
00:03:57.691 --> 00:04:02.430
nobleman barons but there was a king and he was not inconsequential.

51
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.490
That's the situation that obtained in mastodon

52
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.093
in a certain sense.

53
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.450
If a Greek had looked at Macedonian society prior to Philip he might have

54
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.590
described it as Homeric and you'll be familiar with that.

55
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.550
<v 1>Sure there were guys called vacillates but they were not really the rulers over</v>

56
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.720
the the barons these great King and these great noblemen in their kingdom and

57
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:36.910
they thought of it as uncivilized in the technical sense if you don't live in a

58
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.060
palace a city as they understood it then you are not civilized you are part of

59
00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:49.240
an ethos and that's the term they used of the tribal societies all around them.

60
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.320
El-Erian Sicilians they were all s from from from an ethnic

61
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.650
the Macedonians on the other hand.

62
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.670
Claimed very proudly and powerfully and insistently that they were Greeks they

63
00:05:04.641 --> 00:05:09.641
were hellions and they probably invented a myth of their descent.

64
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.330
Indeed not merely from Greeks but from the real Greeks.

65
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.350
That is to say the R drives who were the leading people in the time of Homer's

66
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.720
poetry and they they claim direct descent from Agamemnon and the other jive

67
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.150
kings we hear about various Macedonian monarchs of some importance prior to

68
00:05:33.381 --> 00:05:35.810
Philip back at the time of the Persian War.

69
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.790
Alexander the first played an interesting and shady role between the Greeks and

70
00:05:40.791 --> 00:05:45.791
the Persians during the Peloponnesian War we hear of a king paradox who also

71
00:05:46.491 --> 00:05:49.950
played a role shifting between the Spartans and the Athenians.

72
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.860
This business of shifting between sides is not just because they are shifty

73
00:05:54.861 --> 00:05:59.861
people it's that their status is such that they're always vulnerable and not

74
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:03.860
powerful enough to defend themselves and so they have to make the best deal they

75
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:07.100
can with whoever has the power at any moment.

76
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.560
One other smart Macedonian king has left a name that we know something about

77
00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.260
archeologists who followed predicts one of the things about him was that he kept

78
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.040
a kind of cultural court at his capital and for instance you reporting is for

79
00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:30.950
reasons that we do not know left Athens at some point in the Peloponnesian War

80
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.610
and came to Macedon where he joined the collection of artists and scholars and

81
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.370
whatever that archaeologist was gathering in his kingdom.

82
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.810
Well Philip becomes king in three fifty nine and the Macedonian kings were very

83
00:06:49.691 --> 00:06:52.900
much like Homeric kings as we have described them here.

84
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:58.350
That is yes you had to have a dynastic claim you had to be a member of the royal

85
00:06:58.421 --> 00:07:01.360
family to be king but that wasn't good enough.

86
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.780
You had to also have a member to rule.

87
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.810
As I said about the Homeric kings if he by by force by power you had to have the

88
00:07:11.351 --> 00:07:16.351
actual capacity to command and that was sometimes you had to demonstrate that by

89
00:07:17.891 --> 00:07:22.891
fighting it out among various potential successors with having the winner come

90
00:07:23.591 --> 00:07:27.190
out as the king.
Something like that is what Philip did.

91
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.030
He was not the most direct descendant of the previous king.

92
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:36.570
He was left as a kind of a regent over the under aged young King just a boy.

93
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.680
And he was actually Philip's nephew and nephew and Philip's Ward and Philip took

94
00:07:45.911 --> 00:07:50.911
care of him in more senses than one finally killing him and replacing him on the

95
00:07:53.981 --> 00:07:54.340
throne.

96
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:59.340
That was not a unique event in Macedonian history so Philip is now on the throne

97
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.630
and of course he with this disputed descent.

98
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.920
This is disputed the right to the throne.

99
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.990
You can imagine that he is not in the most secure position when he takes over

100
00:08:13.991 --> 00:08:14.824
this job.

101
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:20.050
And so I think some part of his actions certainly at the early part of his

102
00:08:20.051 --> 00:08:25.051
career and perhaps all the way through was meant to demonstrate his own

103
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:30.540
greatness his own his own capacity to be king so as to put down all resistance

104
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.810
internally and for that purpose.

105
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.840
What could be better than spreading the boundaries increasing the power and

106
00:08:39.881 --> 00:08:43.840
making the greatness of Mastodon more than it had been before.

107
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.790
And that's what he undertook it.

108
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.830
It looks as though I think we have enough evidence to believe that he certainly

109
00:08:50.831 --> 00:08:55.831
of course meant to rule Mastodon and to do whatever was necessary however harsh

110
00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.030
to make that secure.

111
00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:03.690
But it is pretty clear that he had it in mind to conquer Greece to make himself

112
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:09.490
the master of Greece.
That was certainly one of his objectives.

113
00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:15.570
As a matter of fact an interesting part of his biography was that as a young man

114
00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:21.510
I mean probably I should say as a boy probably in his teens he was sent to

115
00:09:22.961 --> 00:09:27.961
Thebes as a hostage as a result of a war between the three bands and the

116
00:09:27.971 --> 00:09:32.020
Macedonians.
But he was treated as a as a member of the royal family.

117
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:37.150
He was treated very decently and with respect and he spent his time in a house

118
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.860
of permanent this.

119
00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:44.490
Can you imagine a better place for young king with his military ambitions to be

120
00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:51.961
brought up than in the House of the man who was surely the foremost general in

121
00:09:54.431 --> 00:09:57.670
the Greece of his time and perhaps of any time.

122
00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:02.230
And I think we should imagine that he must have learned a great deal about

123
00:10:02.231 --> 00:10:06.340
military affairs there.
There remains the question.

124
00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:11.580
Did Philip already have them in his mind the plan of conquering the Persian

125
00:10:13.031 --> 00:10:17.740
Empire which was of course the job that was completed by his son.

126
00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:22.510
Because whatever Philip's intentions may have been he died before he could carry

127
00:10:22.511 --> 00:10:23.344
them out.

128
00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:27.850
And I don't think we can be certain about that but it was an idea that he didn't

129
00:10:27.851 --> 00:10:29.530
have to do a lot to dream up.

130
00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:34.860
I've mentioned to you how many an orator I Socrates most famously had been

131
00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.420
calling on various Greek states and individuals to conquer the Persian Empire to

132
00:10:40.421 --> 00:10:41.860
solve Greece's problems.

133
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:47.020
And he wrote such a letter to Philip once Philip became the most powerful figure

134
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:48.250
in that world.

135
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:53.110
And so he certainly could have had the idea that he did have the idea whether he

136
00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:55.330
was planning to do that or not.
We don't know.

137
00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:01.530
<v 0>Now his first and sort of the instrument that permitted him and mastodon to</v>

138
00:11:04.241 --> 00:11:09.241
become as great as they did was the army that he created.

139
00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:15.540
I mean it is very much he who is the revolutionary the military genius

140
00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:22.530
who creates the weapon which will allow him to conquer Greece and it's the same

141
00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:28.530
military force that enables Alexander the Great who had brought to it who

142
00:11:29.081 --> 00:11:34.081
brought to it brilliant military talents but he had an instrument shaped for him

143
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.540
that was already far and away the best.

144
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:42.790
<v 1>Army in the Greek world the best army the Greek world had ever seen perhaps as</v>

145
00:11:42.791 --> 00:11:45.520
good an army is there ever existed in the ancient world.

146
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:50.890
This is the great achievement of Philip or at least that was the basis of it.

147
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:57.770
<v 2>He was not merely a hop like battle leader in the old style</v>

148
00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:02.060
he was his one thing about Philip.

149
00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:06.770
<v 1>That was very important was his temperament his mind his approach to warfare.</v>

150
00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:11.600
He simply didn't accept the notion of defeat.

151
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:17.110
He didn't accept the notion of making some kind of a deal except on his terms

152
00:12:17.931 --> 00:12:19.790
when he found it necessary to do so.

153
00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:26.050
He's famous for having said after a temporary setback against one of his

154
00:12:26.331 --> 00:12:29.600
opponents.
Philip has said I have not fled.

155
00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:35.320
But I have retired as RAMS do in order that I may might make a stronger attack

156
00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:41.120
the next time and that he he really lived that principle.

157
00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.170
Nobody ever defeated him permanently.

158
00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.160
If he had to accept a temporary setback he immediately went to work to repair it

159
00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:54.490
through a variety of means military diplomatic and whatever else he had

160
00:12:55.521 --> 00:12:56.354
available

161
00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:02.810
but as I'm saying at the moment he crafted this great grand new army supplied

162
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:10.190
led and organized quite differently from what I have described to you in the

163
00:13:10.801 --> 00:13:15.801
past as the standard Greek practice which was essentially the hop life phalanx

164
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.850
and as you know in the course of the Peloponnesian War in the fourth century no

165
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:25.560
new gimmicks were added to that and different devices were contributed to it but

166
00:13:25.561 --> 00:13:27.210
still what.
That was true.

167
00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:32.290
Now Philip absorbed all the things that had been going on before his time.

168
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.820
But he also made fundamental changes in the way that things work.

169
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:44.110
Through his failings and of I was going to say of grim professional soldiers now

170
00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.240
that I think is in itself an enormously important thing.

171
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:56.900
We have something new on the Greek scene an army which is a national army.

172
00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:03.460
It is to say it is made up of Macedonians serving Macedon under a Macedonian

173
00:14:04.591 --> 00:14:05.424
king.

174
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:10.670
But they are not the citizen soldiers that we have examined in the case of the.

175
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:16.510
The police and its failings.
Their hot plates and that.

176
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:22.160
They were professional soldiers so that their full time job was being an army.

177
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.440
They did not spend their spare time back on farms.

178
00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:31.460
That means Philip had to pay them a salary for them to perform at the same time.

179
00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.820
They were not a mercenary army in the traditional sense.

180
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.070
They were not people gathered anywhere who fought for whoever hired them.

181
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.390
They were very much Macedonian soldiers something we can understand the United

182
00:14:45.391 --> 00:14:46.510
States today.

183
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:51.300
An unusual thing in American history beginning only a couple of decades ago.

184
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.880
We have that sort of an army.

185
00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:59.210
We have professional national army and I think this is an objective statement.

186
00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.770
It has become the best army in the world.

187
00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.420
There are many reasons for that but I would argue one reason is that if you can

188
00:15:09.421 --> 00:15:14.421
have the sociological background to permit that kind of an army you are in very

189
00:15:15.541 --> 00:15:16.530
good shape indeed.

190
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:21.450
And that's what Phillip was able to create the kind of loyalty the kind of

191
00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:26.520
commitment that kind of association with the cause that only a citizen or a

192
00:15:26.521 --> 00:15:31.521
subject of a king can have along with the skill and the practice and the

193
00:15:32.401 --> 00:15:36.190
conditioning that is part of being a professional soldier.

194
00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.313
So.

195
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:43.380
So he has this failings made up of these professionals that I'm talking about.

196
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.250
But he added to that.

197
00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:52.950
A group of people called the foot companions peds at Tai Roy is the Greek word.

198
00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.230
Who were the biggest and the strongest of all the Macedonians.

199
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:04.800
And to that group he added the companion cavalry the head high ROI themselves

200
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:08.530
the companions of the King.

201
00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:13.890
And of course these with a nobleman and they became personally attached to fill

202
00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:18.931
up in a special way and with the most effective the most reliable forces that he

203
00:16:20.291 --> 00:16:24.610
had an elite corps.
And here again is something different.

204
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
<v 3>The cavalry will play a much more important role in fighting than it ever has in</v>

205
00:16:31.841 --> 00:16:33.820
the Greek fighting of the past.

206
00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:39.480
One of the great geniuses of Phillip would be to create a combined force that

207
00:16:39.641 --> 00:16:43.900
could use cavalry and infantry and some other subordinate forces I'll tell you

208
00:16:43.901 --> 00:16:48.901
about in a minute jointly together to carry out a rather complex military plan

209
00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:56.460
these of course are these these are high ROI are aristocratic horsemen heavily

210
00:16:56.461 --> 00:17:00.150
armor on strong horses.

211
00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:05.370
That's very important as well because if you're going to use them as shock

212
00:17:05.371 --> 00:17:10.320
troops which he did on many an occasion all of that has to be in place.

213
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:16.350
Then there was a another contingent of infantry with probably less body armor

214
00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.700
than his phalanx had hoped.

215
00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:25.890
What called the shield bearers high pass pistols and they occupied the center of

216
00:17:27.071 --> 00:17:31.030
the Macedonian line next to the flags.

217
00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:36.780
These fellows were usually the first infantry forces to follow behind a cavalry

218
00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:43.141
charge if that's the way Phillips fought the battle charging the cavalry at the

219
00:17:43.361 --> 00:17:44.020
enemy.

220
00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:49.020
<v 2>And as the enemy provided opportunities these shield bearers these lighter</v>

221
00:17:49.331 --> 00:17:54.331
lighter armed infantrymen would find their way and expand the holes opening the

222
00:17:54.671 --> 00:17:59.671
way for the major blow to be struck by the failings of

223
00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.460
I'm describing one kind of battle that could be fought.

224
00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.720
<v 1>The thing about having this kind of varied military force is that you can have</v>

225
00:18:08.721 --> 00:18:11.540
different tactics for different battles and they do.

226
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.480
And Philip does things differently on different occasions.

227
00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:21.360
And there is this group of hype hype asbestos or lighter infantry provide a

228
00:18:22.511 --> 00:18:27.511
crucial link between the first mounted attack and the follow up by the Phalanx

229
00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:32.520
proper so you have a minimum star on top of all of this.

230
00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.960
You have a professional corps again.

231
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:40.330
They're all Macedonians remember made up of really light infantry.

232
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:45.670
That is to say slingers archers javelin men in the traditional mode that the old

233
00:18:47.991 --> 00:18:51.140
Greek armies had but didn't make too much use of typically.

234
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:56.450
And so that rounds out that composite army group made up of these different

235
00:18:56.451 --> 00:18:58.970
kinds of forces and these

236
00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:06.010
missile men I guess you could call them up supplied both preliminary bombardment

237
00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:11.740
with the things they did to help harass the enemy failings but also they provide

238
00:19:13.221 --> 00:19:18.221
a kind of crucial Reserve support if you need to throw some forces into a

239
00:19:19.011 --> 00:19:20.930
suddenly important piece of the battle.

240
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:25.310
These guys were very mobile and you could order them into that place to support

241
00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.750
whatever was going on there.

242
00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:32.020
You can see how infinitely more complex this was than the kind of fighting we've

243
00:19:32.481 --> 00:19:33.500
talked about before.

244
00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:40.210
Now these Macedonian contingents I've been describing do not represent a

245
00:19:40.431 --> 00:19:45.030
fragmentation of forces as might possibly be thought.

246
00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:51.210
<v 4>But rather a sort of a diversification and a sophistication of arms.</v>

247
00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:58.610
As one historian puts it a symphony not a cacophony of professionally equipped

248
00:20:00.971 --> 00:20:01.804
men.

249
00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:07.650
Philip's contribution to the history of Western warfare therefore is not so much

250
00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:13.610
tactical as it is organizational creating this complex complex organization that

251
00:20:17.131 --> 00:20:20.670
could have a variety of tactical uses

252
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.470
now.

253
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:27.470
At first the equipment and the tactics of his Macedonian phalanx for itself did

254
00:20:28.351 --> 00:20:33.060
not differ considerably from the traditional hop light columns of the Greeks.

255
00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:37.140
But he then subsequently made a very important change.

256
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:41.940
Now he does keep the spear the pike.

257
00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:47.120
That was the fundamental weapon of the the old failings but it was lengthened

258
00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:56.150
from being let's say roughly 8 feet long to 14 feet or so.

259
00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.580
Now you cannot hold a 14 foot pike with one hand.

260
00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.490
<v 1>This is a two handed weapon.</v>

261
00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.440
If you're going to control and use it effectively that's what you have to do

262
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:14.510
because you're gonna have two hands on this thing you can't have that hop light

263
00:21:14.511 --> 00:21:15.344
shield.

264
00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:20.380
<v 4>That was the characteristic of the old Half-Life failings so the shield shrank</v>

265
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:23.600
and became unimportant.

266
00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:29.500
You realize that once you do this to your hop light phalanx it can only function

267
00:21:30.201 --> 00:21:33.530
successfully as an aggressive force.

268
00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:37.970
If you see what I mean you can't just take blows.

269
00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.390
You have to be delivering blows all the time.

270
00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:47.960
The Greens and the breast plates and the heavy headgear were replaced either

271
00:21:47.991 --> 00:21:52.991
with leather which was lighter or very various composite materials or else

272
00:21:53.601 --> 00:21:54.770
abandoned altogether.

273
00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:59.180
So you can see these hot lights don't look anything like the hot lights we're

274
00:21:59.181 --> 00:22:00.014
accustomed to.

275
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:06.310
The central idea however of the fighting of a fighting mass of infantrymen

276
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:12.190
remained predominant in fact integrated with and protected by such diverse

277
00:22:12.921 --> 00:22:17.921
forces Phillips phalanx of true Pike men their lances now allowed the first

278
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:21.610
five.

279
00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:27.260
<v 1>Not merely the first three ranks to strike at the enemy was both more lethal and</v>

280
00:22:28.981 --> 00:22:33.981
more versatile than the traditional pop like the historian plebeians who wrote

281
00:22:36.461 --> 00:22:38.440
in the second century B.C..

282
00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:44.100
But you have to realize he was a contemporary of Macedonian soldiers who were

283
00:22:46.121 --> 00:22:50.960
still fighting in fundamentally in the same way that Phillip had created.

284
00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:52.840
So he knew what he was saying.

285
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:57.580
<v 3>He for instance he describes the great battles between the Romans and the</v>

286
00:22:57.581 --> 00:23:01.810
Macedonians that occurred late in the third and into the second century.

287
00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:07.690
So you even saw he even saw or certainly knew about.

288
00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:13.560
The new failings the Macedonian failings tackling the Roman legion and fighting

289
00:23:14.261 --> 00:23:15.760
it practically to a standstill.

290
00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:22.320
Libya says that infantry who faced such a storm of spears as he puts it might

291
00:23:25.211 --> 00:23:29.960
have as many as ten iron points concentrated on each man.

292
00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:36.380
Nothing him Polonius concluded can stand up to the Phalanx the Romans but the

293
00:23:39.581 --> 00:23:44.581
Roman by himself with his sword can either slash down or break through the ten

294
00:23:46.691 --> 00:23:49.810
spears that all at once pressed against him.

295
00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:55.150
Well he has to face the fact that the Roman legion did defeat one of these

296
00:23:55.151 --> 00:23:58.450
phalanx as in the course of the third century.

297
00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:03.790
But I think if you look at the details you realize it wasn't nothing inevitable

298
00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:05.000
about that defeat.

299
00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:10.290
Circumstances in battle allowed the Romans to win because it put a premium on

300
00:24:11.951 --> 00:24:14.020
the great advantage that the.

301
00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:19.570
<v 1>Legion had over the failings namely that it was divided up into smaller fighting</v>

302
00:24:19.571 --> 00:24:24.571
units that could adjust and move about the field much more freely than the

303
00:24:25.481 --> 00:24:27.700
fighters in the phalanx of the Macedonians.

304
00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:32.080
That was certainly an edge that the Legion had but there never was a time when a

305
00:24:32.081 --> 00:24:37.081
legion fighting a good Macedonian failings could predict that it would win much

306
00:24:37.841 --> 00:24:39.580
less than it would be any kind of a walkover.

307
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.270
Of course against the kind of forces that Philip faced.

308
00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:48.130
It was all the more likely to produce a Macedonian victory because those were

309
00:24:48.131 --> 00:24:50.440
not Roman legions that they had to face.

310
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:57.670
Now if you're going to have a national mercenary army a national army made up of

311
00:24:58.791 --> 00:25:02.140
professionals that means it costs money.

312
00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:08.140
In a way that the old failing system did not require the expenditure of funds

313
00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:09.613
very much.

314
00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:15.360
<v 5>And so Philip early in his career had to gain control of sources of money.</v>

315
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:21.420
And he did some
early as king.

316
00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.290
He immediately had to put down his opponents from within Macedonia.

317
00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:27.393
But he also.

318
00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:32.410
<v 2>Did what I suppose Macedonian Kings always had to do on their accession.</v>

319
00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:37.650
They were surrounded by what the Greeks called barbarian peoples and these

320
00:25:38.381 --> 00:25:42.100
barbarian peoples were always fighting against the Macedonians and trying to

321
00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:44.410
push back their frontiers and so on.

322
00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:50.370
So Philip turned against these the Olympians and various other peoples and did

323
00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:56.820
an excellent job of defeating them driving them back establishing the boundaries

324
00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:02.170
where he wanted them in the process accomplishing two very important things.

325
00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:07.770
<v 3>One was to establish his credentials as a great general and leader for internal</v>

326
00:26:11.021 --> 00:26:15.730
purposes and for military purposes is in the sense of winning the confidence of

327
00:26:15.731 --> 00:26:19.570
his soldiers but also

328
00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:26.100
it meant that his own stature in general and the reputation that he gained both

329
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.430
among enemies and friends grew.

330
00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:36.520
And finally the last point he this kind of fighting allowed him to train his

331
00:26:38.151 --> 00:26:43.151
army and to create this army and to make it as excellent as it became before he

332
00:26:44.841 --> 00:26:47.600
had a face more formidable forces than these.

333
00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:53.770
So now he has won the loyalty of his nobility to a degree that no predecessor

334
00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:58.270
ever had.
He now has these barons who are so independent.

335
00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:02.900
Happily gladly serving him and being rather in awe of him.

336
00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:08.800
And the Army in general was devoted to him in a way that was unprecedented for

337
00:27:09.201 --> 00:27:14.201
the Macedonians now with this weapon largely forged he was able to begin serious

338
00:27:16.991 --> 00:27:20.500
expansion in the.
Greek world.

339
00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:24.020
A critical step rather early in his

340
00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:30.910
monarchy was his attack on AM simple as and you will remember and fabulous.

341
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:37.310
<v 2>Was this Athenian colony that was such a big deal for the Athenians that they</v>

342
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.130
were prepared to do almost anything to get it back.

343
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:45.030
But they never had thoroughly been able to get it back until recently.

344
00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:49.980
And so now he took out simplest what was more important than anything for him

345
00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:55.270
was it who held out for Palace was likely to hold mount pan GM which is right

346
00:27:55.441 --> 00:28:00.441
near and fabulous which contain gold and silver mines that were producing wealth

347
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:05.880
as they had been for centuries now.

348
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:11.600
And now that wealth was going into Philip's pocket and he used it for the

349
00:28:13.061 --> 00:28:18.061
purpose that was most important chiefly for supply paying for that army that I

350
00:28:19.211 --> 00:28:24.211
have been talking about we are told that this produced about a thousand talents

351
00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:29.260
a year for Phillip's use that that's about the same amount that the Athenians

352
00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:33.610
got out of their empire.
So you are talking about lots and lots of money.

353
00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:38.970
And this explains the economic capacity that gave Philip the chance to use the

354
00:28:39.641 --> 00:28:40.650
kind of army he had.

355
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:47.500
But he was extraordinarily skillful at the game of diplomacy.

356
00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:51.620
I say game because he treated it in that way.

357
00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:56.920
It was a diplomacy I think for him was an extension of military forces by

358
00:28:57.921 --> 00:28:58.780
peaceful means.

359
00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:03.290
It's kind of a standing clause of its definition of war on its head.

360
00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.313
<v 3>Who was it.</v>

361
00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:12.100
Sir John Fortescue I think it was in the 15th century this defined a diplomat as

362
00:29:13.431 --> 00:29:16.720
a man sent to lie abroad for his country.

363
00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:23.290
I think the spirit behind that pun was certainly right fulfilling that for him.

364
00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:29.050
Diplomacy was a way for advancing his country's interests by whatever means that

365
00:29:30.381 --> 00:29:31.980
he possibly could.
He was very good.

366
00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:37.420
And one of his very great skills was precisely to lie in a very convincing

367
00:29:37.911 --> 00:29:38.744
manner.

368
00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:44.390
<v 2>And of course it's much easier to get people to believe what you say if you have</v>

369
00:29:44.391 --> 00:29:49.391
got the strongest army anywhere in sight in case you should be so impolite as to

370
00:29:50.001 --> 00:29:53.240
say you're a liar.
I think that must have assisted him.

371
00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:57.860
But what I mean is Philip would say he come into into a conflict with some

372
00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:03.400
policy or some place over some territory that was in dispute or whatever and

373
00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.590
they would say Philip what are you trying to do.

374
00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:10.850
You seem to be trying to conquer this trade.
Oh no no no.
Philip said I have.

375
00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:15.410
I have absolutely no no interest in this territory.

376
00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:18.830
I've got other things to do that much more important those proteins in my

377
00:30:18.831 --> 00:30:20.510
background require my attention.

378
00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:25.280
And when the other guys would calm down he would commonly take the place that he

379
00:30:25.281 --> 00:30:28.850
had left alone.
I'm reminded and I guess.

380
00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.790
<v 6>After the Second World War.</v>

381
00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:37.600
In fact even before there was some scholars who made the analogy between Hitler

382
00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:45.080
and Philip and the Boston keys and Churchill.

383
00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.430
It's not the worst one.

384
00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:49.190
It's very imperfect but it's not the worst analogy possible.

385
00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:53.510
But remember Hitler kept saying before his strength was great enough simply to

386
00:30:53.511 --> 00:30:58.511
launch a major work he would say if you give me this that's all I'm interested

387
00:30:59.451 --> 00:30:59.900
in.

388
00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:03.660
<v 3>That is absolutely my last territorial demand in Europe.</v>

389
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:08.660
And then in a few months he would then seize Austria or something like that.

390
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:12.050
So Philip reminds me of that.

391
00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:14.960
Because he did such things from time to time.

392
00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:22.740
It said there's just too much to tell in terms of the detail of his career.

393
00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:27.770
But let me just hit a few highlights and give you the direction in which it was

394
00:31:27.961 --> 00:31:30.550
going.
The first.

395
00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:35.080
Business that he had to do after he gain and fifth place and the wealth of the

396
00:31:35.081 --> 00:31:40.081
mines was to gain control of the shoreline of the northern Aegean Sea.

397
00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:46.570
And that meant of course his own Mastodon Macedonia which he had but also

398
00:31:46.571 --> 00:31:49.900
eastward into the region of threats.

399
00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:54.160
And he began precisely to gain control in those places.

400
00:31:55.180 --> 00:32:00.180
It was in 357 that he took and simplest and that meant that he had to clash with

401
00:32:02.441 --> 00:32:03.274
Athens.

402
00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:08.760
Because as I say Athens had never given up its claim to him fabulous and kept

403
00:32:08.891 --> 00:32:13.360
trying to get it back because of its value to the Athenians.

404
00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:20.070
But we will see is war between Philip and Athens on and off.

405
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:25.870
<v 2>Until the final victory of Macedonia.
It's.</v>

406
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:29.910
A period of quite a stretch of time in the year in which that's going on.

407
00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:35.210
On the other hand it's never a full scale war with Philip trying to conquer

408
00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.000
Athens how could he.

409
00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:42.320
He's still outside from a territorial point of view outside the entire old Greek

410
00:32:43.091 --> 00:32:48.091
world but they can he can cause all the havoc he wants to.

411
00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:52.390
In the northern Aegean and the Athenians will be unhappy about it.

412
00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.600
They will send forces up into that part of the world to contest Philip's

413
00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.160
expansion and that's where the fighting goes on.

414
00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:05.490
But the Athenians are not ready to take him on and really try to stop him from

415
00:33:07.241 --> 00:33:09.280
going where he seems to be going.

416
00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:13.720
What they do is they respond when he does something that annoys them or that

417
00:33:13.721 --> 00:33:14.620
they're worried about.

418
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:19.480
Sometimes they go out and fight him but usually they don't.

419
00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:23.860
Or sometimes they do and they do so too little and too late.

420
00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:28.450
That's the story of the relationship between these two powers.

421
00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:31.540
<v 1>Throughout this whole stretch of time</v>

422
00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:38.520
with the expansion of Phillip in a variety of directions he increases his

423
00:33:40.421 --> 00:33:44.810
revenues wherever he conquers Cecily gets down into Sicily.

424
00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:48.460
Now we're talking about territory that the Greeks consider to be Greece.

425
00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:52.960
And Philip is now gaining more and more control of that area.

426
00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:58.920
<v 3>Revenues grow and he even builds a navy and begins to challenge Athens and</v>

427
00:34:00.221 --> 00:34:04.210
others at sea.
He attacks Athenian commerce when he is in.

428
00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:09.440
When he is quarrelling with the Athenians if he in position in general is badly

429
00:34:10.751 --> 00:34:15.751
weakened in the years between 357 and 355 in what the traditional historians

430
00:34:19.721 --> 00:34:21.340
calls the social war.

431
00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:26.410
<v 2>That doesn't mean that a fight they fought over tea cups or anything like that</v>

432
00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:31.740
social derives from the Latin word Saki which means allies.

433
00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:36.960
<v 5>It was a rebellion against the allies of Athens in the theme in Confederation</v>

434
00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:42.183
which

435
00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:46.810
really frightened the Athenians and kept them busy putting it down for a couple

436
00:34:46.811 --> 00:34:47.644
of years.

437
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:53.190
<v 4>There is some debate among scholars today as to how oppressive or not was the</v>

438
00:34:56.321 --> 00:34:58.180
Athenian rule of its empire.

439
00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:03.930
<v 2>The reason more recent scholarship has suggested that the Athenians were not</v>

440
00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:10.290
really very oppressive which leaves four I think for them an uncomfortable

441
00:35:10.991 --> 00:35:11.800
question.

442
00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:16.800
If that's true why was there this rebellion in the years three fifty five.

443
00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:21.490
We just don't know enough to talk details about this but I think there can be no

444
00:35:21.491 --> 00:35:21.970
mistake.

445
00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:26.470
The Athenians abused their position of power and leadership in the Empire.

446
00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:31.830
They didn't do so as thoroughly and completely as they did in the great Athenian

447
00:35:32.261 --> 00:35:33.400
Empire of the 5th century.

448
00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:38.530
But that was largely because they couldn't they never had the power they never

449
00:35:38.531 --> 00:35:39.364
had the.

450
00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:45.990
Financial strength to be able to impose their will as the earlier empire had.

451
00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:51.270
But they did what they could and they did enough to annoy their allies into such

452
00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:52.413
a rebellion.

453
00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:58.390
Athens recovers they win they put down the Allied rebellion but they are

454
00:35:58.391 --> 00:36:03.391
weakened in the process and 356 there breaks out on the mainland of Greece what

455
00:36:05.331 --> 00:36:08.120
they call the sacred war.

456
00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:13.660
It's the old business of who controls the Delphic Oracle the neighbors foxes and

457
00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:17.674
locusts.

458
00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:23.310
Frequently take advantage of opportunities to gain control of the Oracle and to

459
00:36:24.311 --> 00:36:27.760
deprive the priests of their control of the region.

460
00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:32.920
<v 6>The priests then call on other Greeks traditionally led by Sparta but not always</v>

461
00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:39.420
to beat up the people who have taken over the oracles place and drive them out

462
00:36:41.801 --> 00:36:45.520
and restore it to the priests.
Well this is another in that theory.

463
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:50.670
In that series of events Thebes and forces are involved in a war over Delphi the

464
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:56.590
fashion general.

465
00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:01.120
<v 3>The only time it crops up in this story on a mark is apparently was an</v>

466
00:37:01.121 --> 00:37:06.121
outstanding military leader and defeated the thieves and even pushed into

467
00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:07.983
fiercely.

468
00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:13.800
And that brings Philip into the picture because Philip has been expanding

469
00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:18.340
Macedonian power into Sicily from the north coming south.

470
00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:23.850
And so Philip takes his forces and he pushes the oceans back defeats and Marcus

471
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.110
sends them off.

472
00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:30.730
Now here's the question is this a good or bad for the Greeks.

473
00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:35.830
On the one hand the once thought would be well sure he's just put down this

474
00:37:35.831 --> 00:37:40.831
fellow who has arrogantly seized the Delphic oracle but now who is there who is

475
00:37:42.731 --> 00:37:46.240
sitting in testily this great big new army.

476
00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:50.860
Is he going to be a menace to the Greeks in general.

477
00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:55.720
Well we who have had a chance to know how it came out and know that it did.

478
00:37:56.290 --> 00:38:00.740
But at the time.
People were divided.
Some to.
Oh my heavens.

479
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:05.790
This is a thoroughly aggressive man at the head of an army that looks incredibly

480
00:38:05.981 --> 00:38:08.320
strong and he has terrific ambitions.

481
00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:13.400
What are we going to do against those who said no it's ok he's he's OK.

482
00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.300
Now he's happy.
He doesn't want to do any more than that.

483
00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:19.160
Let's take a look at Athens.

484
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:24.190
Who will mess which will necessarily be the leading figure in the opposition to

485
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.440
Philip such as it is Thebes.

486
00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:32.480
Last time we looked at thieves thieves had reached a position of power perhaps

487
00:38:32.481 --> 00:38:34.520
greater than that of Athens.

488
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:39.550
But you remember the deaths of plop at us and a permanent US simply did not

489
00:38:40.701 --> 00:38:45.701
allow thieves to continue to have that vitality and power that it had before.

490
00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:48.320
It's still a very strong state.

491
00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:53.810
It's it's hotplate phalanx it's still formidable they still have great ambitions

492
00:38:53.931 --> 00:38:54.764
and so on.

493
00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:59.770
But it turns out they don't really have the capacity to take the lead in such a

494
00:39:00.981 --> 00:39:01.814
business.

495
00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:06.850
The Athenians do and they are very much concerned about what's happening but

496
00:39:07.891 --> 00:39:12.540
it's not the same Athens that we saw in the height of its power in the fifth

497
00:39:12.541 --> 00:39:15.420
century relatively speaking.

498
00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.690
It is a very poor place indeed.

499
00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:24.710
It is however still the number one naval power in the Greek world and therefore

500
00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:30.800
very important.
Let's take a look at the internal life of Athens a little bit.

501
00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:35.630
Notice some changes they will have some significance in terms of what decisions

502
00:39:35.631 --> 00:39:39.830
the Athenians make.
There was something that was introduced.

503
00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:43.790
We don't know just when it might have been late in the Peloponnesian War.

504
00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:48.590
It might have been afterwards.
It is called the Theo Ric fund.

505
00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:54.130
And what that is it gets its name apparently because there was a a payment to

506
00:39:56.481 --> 00:40:01.481
the Athenian citizens of the price necessary to pay for the ticket to see the

507
00:40:03.591 --> 00:40:06.820
great theatrical festivals twice.

508
00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:11.900
That went on twice a year in Athens which had apparently degenerated pretty much

509
00:40:13.671 --> 00:40:18.671
into a door into a kind of a welfare fund for the very poor.

510
00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:24.490
It did not amount to a stunning amount of money but given the poverty of Athens

511
00:40:25.431 --> 00:40:30.431
in general any fund of money could be very significant.

512
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:35.410
At critical moments especially on issues of national defense.

513
00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:41.110
<v 2>But there was a lot of argument in sort of the Democratic Party the party of the</v>

514
00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:46.460
underprivileged or whatever always insisted that everybody supposed to keep

515
00:40:46.461 --> 00:40:50.840
hands off of the art fund which should only be used for its welfare state.

516
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:52.370
I am back.

517
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:55.550
I'm embarrassed to use such a term because of course there's nothing like that

518
00:40:55.551 --> 00:40:56.384
in the ancient world.

519
00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:01.700
I'm just for that portion of the of the national income that was used to

520
00:41:01.701 --> 00:41:05.150
alleviate the worst poverty.
They wanted that on touch.

521
00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:10.240
But when the state was under siege it was under threat was in had to go to war.

522
00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:17.000
So it seemed to some politicians they needed the money to do it and say let's

523
00:41:17.001 --> 00:41:20.870
take this the ORIC fund for now while we have this necessity.

524
00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:22.820
And there'd be a fight about that.

525
00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.990
<v 7>Remember the Athenian Empire in the 5th century.</v>

526
00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:33.140
<v 3>Never had a money not never but could generally handle its money problem because</v>

527
00:41:33.311 --> 00:41:37.530
they've had this great income from the Empire say roughly a thousand towns a

528
00:41:37.531 --> 00:41:40.890
year coming in that was not true.

529
00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:46.370
So that if Athens wanted to send an expedition anywhere they had to levy a

530
00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:53.620
direct war tax it was called the ACE for RA.

531
00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:58.030
They had done so two or three times during the Peloponnesian War.

532
00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:01.060
So far as we know they had never done it before that time.

533
00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:06.600
We've stressed how unnatural direct taxation was in the Greek world.

534
00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:11.500
But here that's what they really had.

535
00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:17.130
They had to pay this ace Farrar if they were going to conduct a military and

536
00:42:17.501 --> 00:42:19.650
naval campaigns that they felt were necessary.

537
00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:25.600
In fact they used to be true that individual Greeks back in the 5th century

538
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:31.300
could pay their share of what was assigned to them for the ACE Farrar

539
00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.513
individually.

540
00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:37.330
But now there were so few people who could do that that they organized groups of

541
00:42:37.331 --> 00:42:41.920
tax payers whom they called symmetries who would share the burden.

542
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000
It makes me think that it probably sank further down the sort of the wealth

543
00:42:49.241 --> 00:42:54.241
class of Athens more people I guess we're now paying taxes than before.

544
00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:58.360
In the first century the only people who pay taxes were the very wealthy.

545
00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:03.700
And now that I think was attenuated as people who were not so wealthy had to pay

546
00:43:03.701 --> 00:43:04.960
something as well.

547
00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:11.100
And another thing is that we find the Athenians using as a regular thing in

548
00:43:13.601 --> 00:43:17.710
these campaigns that they will have to fight mercenary soldiers.

549
00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:22.630
And I don't mean mercenaries of the Macedonian kind of the kind that Phillip was

550
00:43:22.631 --> 00:43:23.290
using.

551
00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:28.290
I mean hiring a band of mercenaries who might come from any place in Greece.

552
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:35.500
And that was because the Athenians were reluctant themselves to go out on

553
00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:40.790
expeditions and nothing could be more different.

554
00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:45.580
I think from the way the Athenians behaved in the 5th century when they were all

555
00:43:45.581 --> 00:43:50.581
over the joint as you remember in 457 that inscription that talked about those

556
00:43:51.221 --> 00:43:56.221
who died from one tribe all over the map they were proud of it and they never

557
00:43:56.441 --> 00:43:58.840
ran short of soldiers willing to do this kind of thing.

558
00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:04.200
The assembly voted it and the people will not and not now the Athenians are

559
00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:07.400
reluctant to engage in these activities.

560
00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:13.410
<v 2>Neither they're our main source for complaint about this is the master and his</v>

561
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:18.670
who much of the time is pleading with the Athenians to recognize the danger

562
00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:19.970
presented by Philip.

563
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:24.610
<v 3>And for them to take the necessary steps to check Philip before it was too late</v>

564
00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:30.840
and what he asked them to do repeatedly was to first of all vote the money that

565
00:44:31.961 --> 00:44:36.961
was necessary to support the expedition and then not to hire mercenaries but to

566
00:44:37.691 --> 00:44:40.630
serve themselves in the fighting.

567
00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:44.900
And he did not win those arguments very often.

568
00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:51.350
There were in Athens throughout this period people that we would call in our own

569
00:44:51.351 --> 00:44:56.351
jargon hawks and doves people who were ready to fight.

570
00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:02.570
For these purposes and people who were very reluctant to do so.

571
00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:04.753
The.

572
00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:11.040
The people who seemed to be the most reluctant to do this were the upper classes

573
00:45:12.041 --> 00:45:17.041
of course because war meant taxation and they were going to do the bulk of the

574
00:45:18.101 --> 00:45:22.970
pain of the taxes it may well be I don't want to make too much of this.

575
00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.760
Philip wherever he could.

576
00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:31.280
Would install oligarchic governments in places that he ruled he was not

577
00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:37.280
interested in democracy.
He was not a friend of democracy.

578
00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:42.940
There were some Athenians who had never given up their hope that an oligarchy

579
00:45:43.491 --> 00:45:48.491
could be placed into Athenian into Athens instead of a democracy.

580
00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:53.200
<v 6>They would have been doves and more.</v>

581
00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:58.230
I mean there is a pretty clear indication that Philip did in Athens what he did

582
00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:00.940
in other states as well.

583
00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:06.330
He bribed important Athenians to be champions of his cause and the people it's

584
00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:13.700
easiest to get this to work with our people who agree with your approach we're

585
00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:15.570
on your side of the argument.

586
00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:17.530
<v 5>So there was some of that</v>

587
00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:24.100
and I mean there was a real difference of opinion as there always is that we

588
00:46:24.101 --> 00:46:25.180
should be very aware of it.

589
00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:30.330
In recent years this is the kind of thing you see some people in society seeing

590
00:46:30.881 --> 00:46:35.881
a great danger out there that must be prepared for and confronting others

591
00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:41.360
thinking that that is overblown that that is too pessimistic.

592
00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:45.790
That there is no such great danger or that it can best be dealt with by

593
00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:50.530
negotiation and conversation and anything but fighting.

594
00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.410
And that was the situation in Athens.

595
00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:01.360
<v 6>You could if you were hostile if you were a member of the Hawk faction you would</v>

596
00:47:01.641 --> 00:47:06.641
say your opponents were deluding themselves about the degree of the danger and

597
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:10.280
that Phillip was a very special kind of a menace.

598
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:15.140
If you were a dove you would accuse your opponents of being alarmists

599
00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.750
excessively afraid and worse.

600
00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:22.870
Of course both both sides accused each other of much worse things having to do

601
00:47:23.091 --> 00:47:26.210
with their characters and so on.
As people always do.

602
00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:33.730
<v 3>The first statement we have of DeMoss the NIS who will emerge as the dominant</v>

603
00:47:34.551 --> 00:47:39.551
hawk for most of the time that he is doing business in Athens is in 351 when he

604
00:47:41.961 --> 00:47:45.670
delivers the speech that we call the first Filipic.

605
00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:51.160
He delivered a series of speeches attacking Philip and warning the Athenians of

606
00:47:53.061 --> 00:47:58.061
the danger presented by Philip to this day Filipic is a word in English which

607
00:47:58.821 --> 00:48:03.821
means a strong attacking piece of rhetoric against some individual or some

608
00:48:05.781 --> 00:48:06.614
nation.

609
00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:13.890
<v 7>He charged the Athenians with having created the great danger that they faced by</v>

610
00:48:14.201 --> 00:48:19.201
making Phillip into a great man through neglect by their refusal to stop him

611
00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:22.090
when it was relatively easy to do so.

612
00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:23.730
<v 8>They should send.</v>

613
00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:28.730
<v 3>He thought a fleet of good sized fleet to serve in the northern Aegean Sea and</v>

614
00:48:30.821 --> 00:48:34.660
to stop Philip's expansion and to stop Philip period.

615
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:37.930
He urged them and he will do this over and over again.

616
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:42.580
Don't hire mercenaries enlist for service yourself.

617
00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:47.600
Vote a war tax.
And those of you who should pay it should do so.

618
00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:49.840
He lost the argument.

619
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:54.990
The Athenians did not take that action that he recommended Philip.

620
00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:01.000
Pretty soon after that attacked.
The old Lindsey ends you remember.

621
00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:06.340
This is an important state on the Charles civic peninsula.

622
00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:11.570
It has been a very significant state back in this century.

623
00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:15.550
You remember when the Spartans went up there to defeat the Olympians so it

624
00:49:15.551 --> 00:49:17.140
constructed a league of their own.

625
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:21.820
Well they weren't out of business yet so Philip went after them.

626
00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:23.350
And again.

627
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:26.103
<v 9>What's his name.</v>

628
00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:33.540
<v 2>Damascus's urges the Athenians to get involved and to prevent Philip from taking</v>

629
00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:39.740
all Leonsis and the shell Citic states and gaining control of the Northern GNC

630
00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:43.440
and all the danger that that presented to Athenian interests.

631
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:49.580
Again he loses the argument.

632
00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:55.300
He delivers three Olympic speeches which have the same character as the one I've

633
00:49:55.611 --> 00:49:56.444
described.

634
00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:01.900
But the Athenians do not do it in the year 348 Oh Leonsis falls

635
00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:10.470
the other in that city and the other cities of the region were destroyed.

636
00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:17.990
And you remember this is not a typical way in which the Greeks dealt with

637
00:50:18.511 --> 00:50:22.890
defeated states although heaven knows the Peloponnesian War had seen examples of

638
00:50:22.891 --> 00:50:25.620
it but it was a very very harsh.

639
00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:28.950
<v 3>Kind of warfare that Phillip carried forward.</v>

640
00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:34.610
He destroyed the cities physically enslaved what was left of the population.

641
00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:40.530
And so this was a message I think he wasn't just that he had a cruel
temperament.

642
00:50:40.930 --> 00:50:44.880
Well I suppose he must have had that too but it was meant to be exemplary.

643
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:49.720
It was meant to say when Philip says Do this do it.

644
00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:54.690
Because then he if you don't he will crush you and this is what will happen to

645
00:50:54.691 --> 00:50:58.320
your city and to you that's an old technique.

646
00:50:58.350 --> 00:51:02.760
<v 6>You know that we know that the Assyrians used to do that way back in biblical</v>

647
00:51:02.761 --> 00:51:07.530
times in which they would deliberately be as brutal and cruel as they could be.

648
00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:12.770
And having done so would broadcast how brutal and cruel they had been in order

649
00:51:13.201 --> 00:51:16.590
to encourage other states to behave appropriately in the future.

650
00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:22.920
<v 5>Hitler had used those same tactics early in the Second World War when he</v>

651
00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:28.340
destroyed the city of Rotterdam from the air completely not military whatsoever.

652
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:35.290
It was obviously intended to terrify everybody who might want to resist him.

653
00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:39.570
So that's what Phillip did up there.

654
00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:45.160
Finally after further fighting of one kind or another the Athenians and a number

655
00:51:45.161 --> 00:51:48.810
of other Greeks make a treaty with Phillip.

656
00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:52.450
<v 6>It is called a piece of flock guarantees.</v>

657
00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:56.650
He was one of the negotiators on the Athenian team.

658
00:51:57.550 --> 00:52:01.630
There really didn't seem to be much disagreement among the Athenians as to the

659
00:52:01.631 --> 00:52:03.240
desirability of this piece.

660
00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:08.470
Even the Acehnese who is normally opposed to anything like it felt that it

661
00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:12.670
probably had to be done and I think that just reflected the realities of the

662
00:52:12.671 --> 00:52:17.671
distribution of power and also of the willingness of the Athenians to do

663
00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:20.500
anything more than that.

664
00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:25.390
And so there is this period of the piece of alacrity in which the Athenians make

665
00:52:25.391 --> 00:52:30.391
a defensive alliance with fellow and there at things said when another

666
00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:35.130
development raises the.

667
00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:40.380
<v 3>Panic Button I think for the mass armies and some others</v>

668
00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:45.600
the sacred war is another sacred war going on.

669
00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:52.070
This time the people who want to restore power to the priests invite Phillip to

670
00:52:55.911 --> 00:52:59.330
lead the Greek forces in the sacred war.

671
00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.880
That is a very big deal.

672
00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:07.420
First of all it recognizes the Macedonians as Greeks in the truest sense of the

673
00:53:10.581 --> 00:53:15.581
world word it should have been probably was a major source of satisfaction.

674
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:23.950
For Phillip and an extraordinary glory in the eyes of his fellow Macedonians

675
00:53:24.561 --> 00:53:28.670
that the Greeks should have done was not only accepted them as Helen's but ask

676
00:53:28.671 --> 00:53:33.350
them to save the oracle of Apollo the center of Greek worship their

677
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:39.910
so he takes his army runs into the ocean blasts the fallen Army and does what he

678
00:53:42.561 --> 00:53:47.561
was asked to do in the process when it's all over he decides that from now on

679
00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:54.280
Macedon and King Philip will take not just one vote on the council that governs

680
00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.690
the Delphic oracle.

681
00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:03.860
I may have mentioned it to you earlier in the semester the fact the monarch

682
00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:08.920
Council Council of those who dwell around Delors I mean Delphi.

683
00:54:12.010 --> 00:54:17.010
He took two votes on that council and he made himself president of the pithy and

684
00:54:19.491 --> 00:54:20.030
games.

685
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:24.590
You remember these pan hellenic festivals they were for great pan holiness

686
00:54:24.591 --> 00:54:29.591
festivals Olympia NEMA the Isthmus of cards and the one at Delphi which was

687
00:54:31.521 --> 00:54:32.780
called a pithy and games.

688
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:38.230
And here is this barbarian from Macedonia not only sitting on the council but

689
00:54:40.611 --> 00:54:45.611
being the chairman holding the position of honor as all the Greeks gathered for

690
00:54:46.371 --> 00:54:50.420
the pithy end games.
Well.

691
00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:56.380
This must have had an enormously intimidating effect on many in the Greek world.

692
00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:02.860
And it becomes more and more Athens that has to take the lead.

693
00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:09.050
If anybody is going to resist the Athenians were concerned at least those who

694
00:55:09.051 --> 00:55:14.051
were not determined to accept the course of events and Philip was very careful

695
00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:17.403
with Athens.

696
00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:23.110
For this there was a very good reason it had a special strategic set of

697
00:55:23.471 --> 00:55:26.470
advantages that nobody else in the Greek world had.

698
00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:31.740
And that Philip didn't have an easy answer for Athens was a walled city which

699
00:55:33.221 --> 00:55:38.221
had proven itself capable of defending those walls and you should realize that

700
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:46.000
up to this point in Greek history nobody has demonstrated any kind of ability of

701
00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:53.230
taking a walled city by force.

702
00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:57.430
<v 6>The only way you can take a walled city is by surrounding it and starving it
out.</v>

703
00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:02.700
But you remember now that the Athenians have a navy and walls they can't be

704
00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:04.700
starved out in the same way.

705
00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:10.080
So taking on Athens if you really want to take the city is a job that's very

706
00:56:11.261 --> 00:56:12.190
difficult indeed.

707
00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:16.420
And of course the Athenians have their navy which makes that true but also

708
00:56:16.421 --> 00:56:21.421
allows the Athenians to do you harm in a way that other states cannot do.

709
00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:27.180
So all of that means that Phillip is not about to make a headlong assault on

710
00:56:27.521 --> 00:56:31.950
Athens but to try to have his way by going around Athens somehow.

711
00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:37.500
He tried to win the Athenian support through his usual technique of soft words

712
00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:41.140
explaining how he had no

713
00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:48.010
aggressive intentions in areas that the Athenians were interested in even though

714
00:56:48.011 --> 00:56:50.470
he had already demonstrated that that wasn't right.

715
00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:57.270
And also by working Athenian politics by bribing Athenian politicians to be on

716
00:56:58.091 --> 00:57:03.091
his side and using every device he could to make it harder for the hawkish

717
00:57:03.881 --> 00:57:08.881
people to have their way to master means from here on in is determined and

718
00:57:10.391 --> 00:57:15.391
determinedly against fellow spending all his energy and time trying to get up

719
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:21.870
Athenian support and then indeed to put together a coalition of states besides

720
00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:26.160
Athens to resist and fight and defeat felt.

721
00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:32.350
<v 3>And indeed he is more successful than he was before because the danger from</v>

722
00:57:32.351 --> 00:57:36.520
Phillip is obviously greater so that more Athenians can see it that way.

723
00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:42.330
<v 6>The league he puts together includes you be a mega a at Kani Mia Lucas forces</v>

724
00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:51.240
and finally Thebes and that's a pretty good trick forces and thieves are

725
00:57:51.310 --> 00:57:56.290
traditional opponents but they're both in the league and what that tells you is

726
00:57:56.291 --> 00:58:00.160
that those states and especially those states which are in central Greece

727
00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:05.880
closest to where Filip is located with his forces in the facility and so they

728
00:58:06.941 --> 00:58:11.941
now see that there is a great danger from him and they join in an anti Phillip

729
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:13.833
coalition

730
00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:18.370
he doesn't go at them immediately directly.

731
00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:21.850
<v 5>He goes to war but he does so.</v>

732
00:58:21.890 --> 00:58:26.890
<v 6>Up in the north on the shores of the Aegean Sea he moves eastward.</v>

733
00:58:27.650 --> 00:58:30.680
This is an enormously clever thing to do.

734
00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:35.780
Towards what the Greeks call the cursed Jesus the peninsula which we call the

735
00:58:35.781 --> 00:58:37.370
Gallipoli Peninsula.

736
00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:42.760
The hellish spot Philip wants to gain control of that because if you can control

737
00:58:43.121 --> 00:58:47.480
Inc.
Can Control the helos upon the old story he can cut off trade.

738
00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:51.260
He can starve Athens out and it would hurt others too.

739
00:58:51.290 --> 00:58:53.270
But Athens would be the main attack.

740
00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:58.690
And so he moves forces to the Iranian coast taking various cities there and

741
00:58:59.661 --> 00:59:02.420
gaining more and more territory towards that end.

742
00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:07.780
And then he goes all the way across to the Bosphorus to Byzantium modern

743
00:59:09.181 --> 00:59:12.510
Istanbul.
And he takes that city as well.

744
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:16.380
And of course you can cut off trade if you can control the Bosphorus.

745
00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:20.370
So this is very very serious for Athens.

746
00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:25.560
And it's on this occasion that the master needs deliverance is his third Filipic

747
00:59:26.850 --> 00:59:31.850
making the same case as he has been making all along and only doing so I think

748
00:59:34.231 --> 00:59:38.760
he's been even greater intensity and this time with more persuasiveness because

749
00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:44.150
more and more Athenians understand how serious this menace has become a small

750
00:59:46.321 --> 00:59:51.321
point but not so trivial that the Athenians were able even to enlist the support

751
00:59:52.801 --> 00:59:57.801
in language at least by Persia if the Athenians the Greeks are going to fight

752
00:59:58.291 --> 01:00:02.040
this guy would be awfully handy if you could get the Persians support.

753
01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:06.810
As it turns out the Persians don't do anything of importance in resisting

754
01:00:06.811 --> 01:00:08.030
Phillip.
But it's a.

755
01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:12.690
It shows you how the master of these and those Greeks who agreed with him were

756
01:00:12.691 --> 01:00:17.691
attempting to put together a strong coalition as they could to try to stop him.

757
01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:23.410
Forgive me I just don't pay too much attention to what I'm saying but I'm

758
01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:28.411
constantly being being reminded of the behavior of the European states just

759
01:00:29.441 --> 01:00:33.640
prior to the second world war and in place of Persia.

760
01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:39.010
I think we would have to put the United States of America which was out of the

761
01:00:39.011 --> 01:00:44.011
game and sort of constantly trying to stay out of the game powerful isolationist

762
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:49.510
sentiment in this country and people in Europe some people urging that

763
01:00:49.511 --> 01:00:54.511
everything be done to get the United States into the game and others reluctant

764
01:00:55.061 --> 01:00:57.250
to do that.
It wouldn't make any difference.

765
01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:02.200
Nothing would have gotten the Americans to take an active part against Hitler at

766
01:01:02.201 --> 01:01:03.010
that time.

767
01:01:03.010 --> 01:01:08.010
<v 8>And I suspect there was no chance that anybody could have convinced the Persians</v>

768
01:01:08.650 --> 01:01:11.950
to do anything at this point point either

769
01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:19.560
but the Athenians do send the force and it's a good sized force and it does a

770
01:01:19.561 --> 01:01:24.561
very good job and they drive Phillip back out of some of the places that he has

771
01:01:25.021 --> 01:01:29.100
conquered which I think is interesting to think about.

772
01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:34.230
It's not obvious that if the Athenians had gotten their coalition together

773
01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:39.560
earlier and if they had done the best they could it's not obvious that they

774
01:01:40.141 --> 01:01:41.900
couldn't have defeated Phillip.

775
01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:45.990
You know there's this terrible danger that we will all become victims of a fait

776
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.790
accompli what happened obviously had to happen it couldn't happen any other way.

777
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:52.950
No I don't think that's right.

778
01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:57.660
<v 3>We don't certainly don't live our lives as though that's true and we shouldn't</v>

779
01:01:57.661 --> 01:02:02.310
allow ourselves to imagine it's true in retrospect the fact that the Athenians

780
01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:07.520
could have such success against Phillip as they did at this moment is evidence

781
01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:11.100
that that was by no means a hopeless cause

782
01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:17.660
once again a sacred war breaks out over Delphi again the safety sonically this

783
01:02:21.541 --> 01:02:26.541
time of course or having as its president Philip invite Phillip to lead the

784
01:02:28.351 --> 01:02:33.351
forces of the Sacred War the sacred war has been declared against the town near

785
01:02:34.081 --> 01:02:38.940
Delphi called an officer and that's the force that he's going to use against it

786
01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:45.300
Philip moves down from Cecilie arrives at a place not very far from Delphi

787
01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:51.000
called LRT on one side and the other side at Thermopylae.

788
01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:56.250
<v 8>These these are the routes to get down into central Greece.</v>

789
01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:58.890
Once you go through those places you are.

790
01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:04.640
<v 6>Right next to be sure you are a couple of days from Athens you're right in the</v>

791
01:03:04.801 --> 01:03:07.620
middle of a position where you could do terrific harm

792
01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.130
when the Athenians receive the news.

793
01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:16.580
<v 3>There really is panic from the masses tells the story.</v>

794
01:03:17.490 --> 01:03:18.323
Now.

795
01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:23.420
<v 8>The master NIS is a witness who is excellent because he is a participant</v>

796
01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:27.220
contemporary.
That's great.

797
01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:31.620
But he you've got to look at him with a certain amount of skepticism because

798
01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:35.550
he's a participant.
He's a guy who held a certain point of view.

799
01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:38.130
He was very active in politics.

800
01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:43.580
He has strong views on everything his reputation depends upon how you look upon

801
01:03:44.191 --> 01:03:45.024
what he did.

802
01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:49.350
<v 6>So that you must understand that when he tells us these things he's telling it</v>

803
01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:54.590
from his perspective it's very much like Winston Churchill's histories of the

804
01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:00.760
two world wars in which he played a very large part even in the first.

805
01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:06.140
But certainly in the second and it's not that he lies it's not that he deceived.

806
01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:11.840
But when you read those stories you read them as Winston Churchill sees them and

807
01:04:12.421 --> 01:04:13.800
you have to be alert to them.

808
01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:17.910
There's a wonderful nothing about Churchill's wonderful story apparently true

809
01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:22.380
that when when Churchill's book on the first world war came out.

810
01:04:22.450 --> 01:04:26.020
Let's I forget the title but it's let's say it was called The Great War which it

811
01:04:26.021 --> 01:04:26.854
was

812
01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:32.530
the former prime minister Arthur Balfour who didn't like Churchill at all.

813
01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:38.780
It's supposed to have said I see that Winston has published another book about

814
01:04:39.001 --> 01:04:41.550
himself and called it the Great War.

815
01:04:43.350 --> 01:04:46.800
The enemies of the Muslims might say the same things about what he says in some

816
01:04:46.801 --> 01:04:47.460
of his speeches.

817
01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:52.460
But later on in his career when there was a big battle between him and his chief

818
01:04:53.491 --> 01:04:54.324
opponent

819
01:04:55.980 --> 01:05:00.980
his friends most of his friends were asking the Assembly to vote him a crown.

820
01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:06.200
It meant a crown of leaves not a goal but the honor for things he had done for

821
01:05:07.711 --> 01:05:10.990
Athens and his opponents thought that you know what should be done for the

822
01:05:10.991 --> 01:05:15.480
Muslims for what he had done Athens is to throw them off the Acropolis so that

823
01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:19.980
it was a great debate that we have both hands up and it's in that debate that he

824
01:05:19.981 --> 01:05:24.480
recounts the things he has done for Athens why they should be grateful to him

825
01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:27.090
and this moment is one he points to.

826
01:05:27.930 --> 01:05:32.930
<v 8>He tells about the news came to light came to Athens that that Filip was in L.A.</v>

827
01:05:33.591 --> 01:05:38.591
in and he says we all gathered there first thing in the morning and the place

828
01:05:40.081 --> 01:05:40.980
was full.

829
01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:45.750
<v 6>If you remember that passage I read to you from Aristophanes about how things</v>

830
01:05:45.751 --> 01:05:49.500
usually were in the Athenian assembly.
It became ambling in late.

831
01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:51.780
No no probably nobody was in a hurry.

832
01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:57.260
<v 8>No he says and everybody was was there and when the uh brittany for the day the</v>

833
01:06:00.541 --> 01:06:05.541
president the meeting said came to that point we said who wishes to speak no

834
01:06:05.981 --> 01:06:06.814
one.

835
01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.780
<v 5>No one raised their hand</v>

836
01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:14.330
and then I got up and gave you guys the good advice that followed all that stuff

837
01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:19.880
but but I think we can't doubt the s the central truth of the situation that

838
01:06:20.331 --> 01:06:25.331
there was just a terrible fear and no idea how to cope the masses then you know

839
01:06:28.310 --> 01:06:32.630
suggested what steps should be taken to resist one of them.

840
01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:34.060
And he was able to do it now.

841
01:06:34.650 --> 01:06:39.480
It was to use that the Ark Fund to supply the forces that were necessary.

842
01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:44.390
Secondly to do something that was quite an achievement from a diplomatic point

843
01:06:44.391 --> 01:06:49.391
of view to make an alliance with themes ever since the late three 70s Athens had

844
01:06:52.521 --> 01:06:57.521
not been allied to Thebes it had become alarmed that Seaborn power and a joined

845
01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:00.770
even with Sparta against the Thebes.

846
01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:05.800
But here as we're into the very late forties early three thirties he makes an

847
01:07:07.881 --> 01:07:12.881
alliance with Thebes so that what is surely the strongest ground force on the

848
01:07:13.621 --> 01:07:18.621
side of the Greeks against Phillip will be there namely the Seabees and the the

849
01:07:20.251 --> 01:07:21.170
big oceans and general

850
01:07:23.030 --> 01:07:28.030
finally in 338 the battle of Crimea takes place in Western B ocean

851
01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:38.180
and the result is a victory for

852
01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:45.180
the battle itself was by no means a walkover.

853
01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:50.870
<v 8>It was very close our accounts of it make it clear that there was every</v>

854
01:07:52.051 --> 01:07:56.670
possibility even then even though the Spartans weren't there even though

855
01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:02.120
Phillips forces were at their peak the Greeks might have won that battle.

856
01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:03.780
That's a very important thing to remember.

857
01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:09.210
But they didn't fill up one and that was the end of Greek freedom.

858
01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:14.660
Thereafter the states all had to bow down to Philip in terms of foreign policy.

859
01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:21.030
In many cases he actually interfered in their internal autonomy.

860
01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:26.360
He established garrisons at key places in the Greek world including Karl Case in

861
01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:31.410
Nubia cards and outran ratio in the West.

862
01:08:32.310 --> 01:08:34.710
And they were called the fetters of Greece.

863
01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:39.300
It was like you put a great chain across Greece to show and demonstrate and make

864
01:08:39.301 --> 01:08:40.680
real his control.

865
01:08:41.490 --> 01:08:46.490
Athens was forced to abandon the Confederacy that its own Confederacy they were

866
01:08:47.191 --> 01:08:48.900
forced to make an alliance with Phillip.

867
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:55.070
He constituted in 336 the league of Corinth with himself as president.

868
01:08:57.070 --> 01:09:00.520
It was an offensive and defensive alliance.

869
01:09:01.210 --> 01:09:06.210
<v 5>Phillip was commander in chief and he could tell everybody what to do and they</v>

870
01:09:07.561 --> 01:09:11.790
would have to do it.
This truly was the end of Greek freedom.

871
01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:17.600
As it turned out Philip was assassinated in the same year so that he never was

872
01:09:19.891 --> 01:09:22.170
able to demonstrate how he would carry on.

873
01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:26.790
Once he had that power the business of the conquest of Persia.

874
01:09:27.090 --> 01:09:32.090
If that was in the mind of Philip had to be left to his very young son Alexander

875
01:09:33.931 --> 01:09:36.410
who I think was 18 at this point

876
01:09:38.290 --> 01:09:43.290
so that gets us to the interesting question of history's judgment on these

877
01:09:44.501 --> 01:09:48.300
events and especially I think the interesting person is the masses.

878
01:09:48.930 --> 01:09:53.930
And as you read in your problems collection the 19th century German historian

879
01:09:56.410 --> 01:10:01.410
droids in and the Germans historians of that time in general had no doubt about

880
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:08.080
the judgment.
It was very negative about the master.

881
01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:13.920
After all what was Athens anyway according to Joyce and it was I'm advocating

882
01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:20.650
the republic the lowest blow anybody could deliver a republic of lawyers.

883
01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:29.340
<v 8>And what the master needs was trying to preserve was client that the high the</v>

884
01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:37.570
the world of small independent states a contemptible term and in the eyes of

885
01:10:39.291 --> 01:10:41.000
Joyce and his fellow nationalists.

886
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:45.380
Germany you remember had just was I forget the date of his writing either we had

887
01:10:45.381 --> 01:10:47.240
already been unified by

888
01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:54.580
Bismarck or there were nationalists were demanding that these little states all

889
01:10:54.651 --> 01:10:59.030
be brought together into a great German Empire.
And that's what Joyce then was.

890
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:05.410
<v 2>The future draws then said was with fellow de Marston is was a reactionary</v>

891
01:11:05.690 --> 01:11:09.590
trying to retain things that were whose time has come and gone.

892
01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:14.150
<v 7>What was needed was the unification of the ancient Mediterranean and this was a</v>

893
01:11:14.151 --> 01:11:16.190
step in that direction.

894
01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:21.400
<v 3>Why was it necessary to have a unification of the ancient Mediterranean as would</v>

895
01:11:21.411 --> 01:11:26.180
finally be accomplished not by Philip and Macedon but by the Romans because it

896
01:11:26.181 --> 01:11:30.800
was all part of the great plan without which there could not have been

897
01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:31.970
Christianity

898
01:11:33.650 --> 01:11:38.650
Christianity could come to the world and dominate Europe because it had been

899
01:11:39.411 --> 01:11:44.411
made into a single world by virtue of the Macedonian Roman conquest and master

900
01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:50.330
knees and his small minded petty way was standing in the way of that

901
01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:57.520
yes there were Admiral bobble things about the mass armies but his behavior and

902
01:11:58.251 --> 01:12:02.010
his policy was quixotic because it was hopeless.

903
01:12:03.450 --> 01:12:08.450
And I think this is my reading of what the Roisin really is saying he lost.

904
01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:10.500
So he must have been wrong.

905
01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:14.100
Winners are always right or else they wouldn't win.

906
01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:18.690
Now I think we can evaluate that in a different way.

907
01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:23.170
If we think about a different situation I've been thinking about it all along

908
01:12:23.171 --> 01:12:27.400
and telling you about it which is let's take a look at Winston Churchill who has

909
01:12:27.401 --> 01:12:32.401
been called by historians that the master needs of that time the man who had

910
01:12:32.441 --> 01:12:37.441
been calling attention to the danger from Hitler and trying to rally support and

911
01:12:39.161 --> 01:12:44.161
really treated like an idiot until finally the knife the dagger was at the

912
01:12:44.681 --> 01:12:46.120
throat of the British.

913
01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:51.780
And only then and with great reluctance did the British put him in control.

914
01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:57.120
Now if we look at his experience and what he did I think it's illuminating the

915
01:12:57.121 --> 01:13:02.121
difference between a heroic victory and disaster can be terribly thin taking

916
01:13:04.561 --> 01:13:08.790
office at a low point in the fortunes of his country and its allies.

917
01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:10.373
Churchill.

918
01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:16.360
<v 5>Made a famous speech which just breathed defiance when there was no physical</v>

919
01:13:17.421 --> 01:13:19.340
justification for such a position.

920
01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:24.850
He said this I have myself full confidence that if all do their duty if nothing

921
01:13:27.891 --> 01:13:28.724
is neglected.

922
01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:34.420
And if the best arrangements are made as they are being made we shall prove

923
01:13:34.571 --> 01:13:39.571
ourselves once again able to defend our island home to ride out the storm of war

924
01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:48.230
and to outlive the menace of tyranny if necessary for years if necessary alone.

925
01:13:51.930 --> 01:13:56.930
We shall go on to the end we shall fight in France we shall fight on the seas

926
01:13:57.530 --> 01:14:02.530
and the oceans we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in

927
01:14:02.731 --> 01:14:07.731
the air and we shall defend our Island whatever the cost may be we shall fight

928
01:14:09.911 --> 01:14:13.870
on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the

929
01:14:13.871 --> 01:14:18.871
fields and in the streets and we shall fight in the hills we shall never

930
01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:21.603
surrender

931
01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:27.780
and yet England came within a hair's breadth of losing that war.

932
01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:34.860
And suffering the horrors of invasion and occupation by Nazi Germany in fact

933
01:14:36.431 --> 01:14:41.431
that Hitler and Goering continued bombing the RAAF landing fields and ground

934
01:14:41.681 --> 01:14:46.330
facilities as they began to do with the Battle of Britain.
Instead of.

935
01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:51.940
Turning away from that using their planes to bomb cities and scaring civilians

936
01:14:53.250 --> 01:14:57.690
it's very clear to me that Germany would have won the Battle of Britain and

937
01:14:57.691 --> 01:15:01.890
control of the air which would have made their success inevitable.

938
01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:04.680
Now imagine that you've gone that way.

939
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:10.430
<v 8>In that case Churchill's bulldog determination his refusal to accept what was a</v>

940
01:15:11.851 --> 01:15:16.851
relatively generous peace offer after the fall of France would seem in

941
01:15:17.551 --> 01:15:22.551
retrospect the wrong headed defiance of a man who brought his people low by his

942
01:15:24.511 --> 01:15:26.010
own intransigence.

943
01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:31.250
<v 5>He would have been treated I think by history as some kind of a gallant fool</v>

944
01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:34.710
some kind of a brave imbecile

945
01:15:36.330 --> 01:15:41.330
but men like Churchill and the masterminds know that those who love liberty must

946
01:15:43.361 --> 01:15:44.194
fight for it.

947
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:50.270
Even against all odds even when there is little support even when victory seems

948
01:15:52.611 --> 01:15:53.444
impossible.

949
01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:59.920
In spite of the outcome it seems to me that the sand of Athens and its Greek

950
01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:05.290
allies at Karenga may have been in words that Churchill used in another contest

951
01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:11.370
context their finest hour.
Thank you very much.
