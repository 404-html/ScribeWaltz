00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.710
For the next couple of weeks we will be examining the uh.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.230
<v 1>Coming and the fighting of the great Peloponnesian War.</v>

3
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.420
It's a subject that had tremendous importance for the Greeks themselves and it

4
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.870
has been one of the things that has occupied people interested in the ancient

5
00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:28.840
Greeks more than most things.

6
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.520
Partly because of its own extraordinary importance.

7
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.550
But I think perhaps even more because of the fact that it was described for us

8
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:43.761
by a participant a contemporary lucidity is the son of a loris and Athenian Who

9
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.140
by common consent throughout the millennia has been agreed upon as one of the

10
00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:52.674
great

11
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.420
historians of ever is sort of the second one that we know of in all of history

12
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.720
but also one who is much esteemed.

13
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.310
I would argue that right now he is probably esteemed more than he has ever been

14
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.120
throughout the history of the world because he's had such a great influence on

15
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.800
thinking in the west and then in the world as well around the world as well.

16
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.670
<v 2>Ever since the 20th century he really came into his own as events like the first</v>

17
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:28.620
and the second world war to be followed then by the cold war seemed to observers

18
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:33.621
of the time to be much illuminated by studying to sit in his account of the

19
00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:40.131
Peloponnesian War and as a consequence his own way of thinking about history and

20
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:45.801
about war and about international relations and about behavior of human beings

21
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:51.471
in the mass and a whole variety of subjects in the realm of politics and

22
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:54.210
diplomacy and war.

23
00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.230
So it's for those reasons I think that this story has been so carefully looked

24
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:03.870
at compared to others in history.

25
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.240
You know that for almost three decades at the end of the 5th century the

26
00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:14.241
Athenian Empire fought against the Spartan alliance in this terrible war that

27
00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:19.731
changed the Greek world and the civilization of the Greeks forever.

28
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.540
From the perspective of the fifth century Greeks the Peloponnesian War deserves

29
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:31.800
to be thought of I think as a world war.
You know I'm sorry.

30
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.270
It just involves the Greeks themselves.
And that's not quite right.

31
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.900
It's one of the points the cities makes.
It drew into it.

32
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.860
Other peoples other than the Greeks who were very important to Persians where

33
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.600
they play a critical role.

34
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.990
And similarly the Macedonians and similarly peoples in Sicily and in Italy.

35
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.940
So it really doesn't require much defense from the Greek point of view to think

36
00:02:56.941 --> 00:03:01.941
of it as a kind of a World War a critical turning point in Greek history causing

37
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.120
enormous destruction of life and property intensifying factional and class.

38
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.240
Hostility dividing the Greek states internally.

39
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.460
It was the cause of civil wars throughout the Greek world throughout its history

40
00:03:22.311 --> 00:03:27.311
and subsequently destabilising the relationship of classes within cities and

41
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.440
between and the relationships between cities ultimately as we can see from

42
00:03:36.321 --> 00:03:37.154
hindsight.

43
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.940
<v 3>Making the capacity of the Greeks to resist an outside threat much weaker and</v>

44
00:03:46.591 --> 00:03:51.420
helping to bring about a situation in which they finally did lose their

45
00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:53.430
independence their autonomy.

46
00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.060
<v 2>So from so many points of view the war may be seen as a tragic event the end of</v>

47
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:03.640
a period of confidence and hope.

48
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.510
And I would want to stress that if you look at the 50 year stretch between the

49
00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:12.511
Persian War and the Peloponnesian War it is the Great Age of Greece when so many

50
00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:19.201
of the things that we value in the experience of the Greeks were created and

51
00:04:19.271 --> 00:04:20.110
carried forward

52
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.160
and a period in which one sees evidence of all sorts of confidence in human

53
00:04:28.291 --> 00:04:33.291
capacities and the hope of what will be in the future all of that I think

54
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.690
suffered a considerable reversal by because of the Peloponnesian War and begin a

55
00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:41.104
darker time.

56
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.340
<v 3>It was a war of unprecedented brutality in Greek life violating even the already</v>

57
00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:56.421
rugged code that had previously governed Greek fighting and breaking through

58
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.080
that thin veneer that separates civilization from savagery.

59
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.110
And it is actually two subsidiaries that that way of thinking about things is Oh

60
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.910
certainly for me.

61
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.680
That's when I first understood what he's teaching us to such a degree in his

62
00:05:16.681 --> 00:05:21.681
history that there is just a very thin veneer that covers over the brutal the

63
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.530
bestial the worst and bestial that exists in human beings even in society but

64
00:05:30.031 --> 00:05:35.031
that society is what makes that covers that over and permit something resembling

65
00:05:37.261 --> 00:05:42.261
what we would call civilization but warfare tends to put a strain on that

66
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.970
limiting element which is what society gives you.

67
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.240
Anger frustration the desire for vengeance increases as the fighting drags on

68
00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.370
producing a progression of atrocities that included maiming and killing captured

69
00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:08.571
opponents throwing them into pits to die of thirst starvation and exposure.

70
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.000
That's what happened in Sicily and hurling them into the sea to drown which

71
00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:17.080
became the practice.

72
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.910
<v 2>Towards the end of the Peloponnesian War is a case of a band of marauders</v>

73
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.720
murdering innocent schoolchildren entire cities were destroyed.

74
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.750
The men kill the women and children sold into slavery.

75
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.250
I don't say there were no atrocities before the Peloponnesian War but nothing

76
00:06:39.251 --> 00:06:44.251
like the concentration of them that developed and also I suspect a whole new

77
00:06:44.711 --> 00:06:47.200
range of them also came into being.

78
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.660
One reason being that in the past wars had been short.

79
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:57.370
<v 4>And one of the messages I think lucidity is wants to give us is that the longer</v>

80
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:02.670
a war persists the more inevitable is the sinking below the civilized levels of

81
00:07:05.741 --> 00:07:06.190
warfare.

82
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:11.190
If there is such a thing as a civilized level of warfare to a much more horrible

83
00:07:12.101 --> 00:07:12.934
way of fighting.

84
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.690
And as I said although the war ended over twenty four hundred years ago it

85
00:07:19.691 --> 00:07:23.280
continues to fascinate readers today.

86
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:27.080
I was astonished.

87
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:32.100
I wrote a one volume history of the Peloponnesian War so fifty thousand copies

88
00:07:32.171 --> 00:07:35.090
of the damn thing
I was.

89
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.020
I truly have made so it was my publisher.

90
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.030
But but I think I shouldn't have been amazed because for.

91
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:50.710
Four maybe a century now people have been studying facilities and the war.

92
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:57.650
Or when they have not been studying them and hearing about it.

93
00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.260
References have been made to it.

94
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:05.360
By distinguished people General Marshall referred to it in a famous quotation

95
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.700
when he was secretary of state.
And people keep talking about it.

96
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:16.730
And so the curiosity I think rather than the familiarity curiosity about what is

97
00:08:17.011 --> 00:08:22.011
this all about may account for this but it's also true that if you go to add the

98
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.580
two cities in the Peloponnesian War are taught.

99
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:32.210
In all the military academies they are taught in all just about I've never heard

100
00:08:33.571 --> 00:08:37.530
one that didn't in all programs of international relations anywhere.

101
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:42.650
That's one of the first books along with the Chinese sage of warfare sun to both

102
00:08:44.131 --> 00:08:48.810
of those seem to be typically read everywhere and and so on.

103
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.620
And it's not that I don't think that this is just an affectation and look at us.

104
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:56.190
<v 5>We read classical stuff.
I don't think that's what it's about.</v>

105
00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:01.250
<v 3>I think it is based on a conviction and supported by arguments by scholars not</v>

106
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:07.341
classes is that there is some continuing meaning some continuing value something

107
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:13.281
we can learn about all of these important topics by reading facility.

108
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.810
So I want to just comfort you for the burden I've laid on you and giving you

109
00:09:18.811 --> 00:09:22.260
that book and all of this stuff to read you're not wasting your time.

110
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.550
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

111
00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.100
I'd like to turn first to the question of the origins of the war the causes of

112
00:09:30.101 --> 00:09:35.020
the war the outbreak of the war however you want to look at that phenomenon

113
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:40.050
because facilities is very interested in that subject and writes about it with a

114
00:09:40.151 --> 00:09:45.151
sophistication that in my opinion has not been proved superseded and rarely

115
00:09:46.511 --> 00:09:49.490
matched in the years since that point.

116
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:56.400
To sit on these whole first book really is about that subject.

117
00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:01.040
How and why.
Did that war come about.

118
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:06.650
And that's a subject I just think is immensely interesting and important

119
00:10:06.651 --> 00:10:07.484
because.

120
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:12.790
We should face the fact that the history of civilized mankind is almost the

121
00:10:14.151 --> 00:10:15.080
history of warfare.

122
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:21.100
<v 2>There's nothing more typical of human societies than that they are organized to</v>

123
00:10:21.411 --> 00:10:22.970
fight wars and do so.

124
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.720
So and I think by the 20th 21st century we ought to have come to the conclusion

125
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.200
this is a bad thing.

126
00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:36.810
War is certainly now whatever positive functions they might have had in the past

127
00:10:38.421 --> 00:10:41.330
and they have been sometimes glorified it for various reasons.

128
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.570
<v 3>The price of them is just far too high for us to think that's fine.</v>

129
00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.780
Let's keep doing that.
So that's the problem.

130
00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.750
Why do wars happen and how can they be avoided.

131
00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:57.780
It strikes me as important a question as there is and subsidiaries I think gives

132
00:10:58.701 --> 00:11:03.701
us some some food to chew on as we think about that.

133
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.920
Well he examined the situation in the first book and concluded with what he

134
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:15.010
calls the truest cause the truest explanation although our quote him now the

135
00:11:18.931 --> 00:11:23.931
truest explanation although it has been the least often advanced I believed to

136
00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:30.051
have been the growth of the Athenians to greatness which brought fear to the

137
00:11:32.551 --> 00:11:36.870
last to die moaning ends and force them to war

138
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.900
scholars differ a bit on what that really means.

139
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:47.430
But I side with what I think of the majority the scholars on this point which is

140
00:11:47.431 --> 00:11:51.030
to say he is really saying that this war.

141
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:56.960
<v 2>Became Inevitable at a certain point when the Athenian Empire.</v>

142
00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:04.170
That's the greatness of Athens reached such a point as to alarm.

143
00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:09.830
The Spartans enough to do what they did which was to start a war to check the

144
00:12:11.761 --> 00:12:13.650
growth of that Athenian power.

145
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:19.100
<v 3>Everything I've said is open to criticism and disagreement and just naturally</v>

146
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.110
great big arguments about these things.

147
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.620
But I'm giving you my view which is not original or unique

148
00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.343
now.

149
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:35.900
<v 2>I think it's important to realize that two cities does not think that sort of an</v>

150
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.760
obvious explanation can be found by examining the circumstances that took place

151
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:50.490
when the war broke out in 431 B.C. and the proof of that is not merely that he

152
00:12:51.251 --> 00:12:56.251
speaks about the truest explanation which means he's rejecting less true ones

153
00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:00.280
which do focus on the events themselves.

154
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:03.590
What we might call the precipitating causes of the war.

155
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:08.940
He begins his account explaining how the war came to two back to the end of the

156
00:13:09.461 --> 00:13:14.461
Persian Wars and the events that are important from his point of view are the

157
00:13:15.251 --> 00:13:19.750
forming of the Dalian League which emerges as the Athenian Empire.

158
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:21.520
That's one critical thing.

159
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:26.550
He goes back to the other critical thing he goes back to is the distrust that

160
00:13:26.981 --> 00:13:31.981
emerged swiftly between Athens and Sparta which turned into a major division in

161
00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:40.270
the Greek world and produced ultimately the suspicion obviously is something

162
00:13:40.271 --> 00:13:42.910
that makes it easier to bring about fear.

163
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:47.290
And so we get to that second element that through Saturday's talks about the

164
00:13:47.291 --> 00:13:52.291
fear that the growth of Athenian power engendered in the Spartans and what is so

165
00:13:53.651 --> 00:13:58.651
splendid in my eyes about some cities understanding of why these things happen

166
00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:04.410
and why it's so superior to what is typically taught in the graduate schools

167
00:14:05.121 --> 00:14:10.121
that it study international relations is he's talking about human emotions.

168
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.180
He's talking about feelings.

169
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:18.010
He's not talking about structures that you need to be a professor in order to

170
00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:18.844
understand.

171
00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.740
I think that that's one of the powerful things lucidity is as interested in

172
00:14:23.741 --> 00:14:27.430
structures the first one ever looks at it thinks it's a very important thing but

173
00:14:27.431 --> 00:14:32.431
when it comes down to explaining why nations go to war he looks at the feelings

174
00:14:33.371 --> 00:14:35.320
that the people involved have.

175
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:41.990
<v 3>Well we've talked already about some of the events that he describes taking them</v>

176
00:14:42.751 --> 00:14:43.650
mainly from him.

177
00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:48.150
I'm talking about the the beginning of the Dalian league conversion into an

178
00:14:48.151 --> 00:14:52.920
Athenian Empire the suspicion that aroused among the Spartans.

179
00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:57.210
But the fact that they worked things out until until this.

180
00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:01.980
The phases in rebellion where we see the Athenians.

181
00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:07.950
Acting more aggressively with less less justification than they ever have
before.

182
00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:12.830
But what I didn't tell you because I wanted to save it for this context is that

183
00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:15.990
there's two cities mentions the fact that.

184
00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:21.890
When the Salesians launched their rebellion against Athens in 465 they went

185
00:15:22.531 --> 00:15:27.531
first to the Spartans and asked them if we rebel against the Athenians will you

186
00:15:28.621 --> 00:15:29.730
invade Attica.

187
00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:34.920
And the F wars the the officials that conduct foreign policy in the first

188
00:15:34.921 --> 00:15:37.530
instance in Sparta said they would

189
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:44.700
well they didn't because before they could do so the great earthquake occurred

190
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.650
which prevented them doing any such thing.

191
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:53.310
It needs to be pointed out that this message that these talks that went on

192
00:15:53.351 --> 00:15:58.351
between the Asians and the Spartans were secret and we have to believe that at

193
00:15:59.051 --> 00:16:03.700
this time the Athenians did not know about these conversations because if they

194
00:16:03.701 --> 00:16:08.701
had there is no way they could have been persuaded to send help 4000 hop flights

195
00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.920
into the Peloponnese just to help the Spartans against the highlights.

196
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.880
So I think we need to.

197
00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:21.980
I think we need to accept facilities assessment of that situation.

198
00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.880
Well we know what happened.

199
00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:29.650
<v 4>The Athenians were sent away because of the suspicion that the Spartans felt for</v>

200
00:16:29.651 --> 00:16:34.480
them and their way of government and this produced a tremendous anger in the

201
00:16:34.481 --> 00:16:39.480
Athenians and it also led to a revolution internally in which the communion

202
00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.520
regime was replaced by one led by more radical democrats like Effie outis and

203
00:16:46.031 --> 00:16:51.031
Pericles and also a diplomatic revolution in which the Athenians withdrew from

204
00:16:52.031 --> 00:16:57.031
the Greek league under Spartan leadership and in which they made alliances first

205
00:16:58.031 --> 00:17:02.860
with our gods the great enemy of Sparta and then with the aliens whom they hope

206
00:17:02.861 --> 00:17:07.060
would supply them with useful cavalry in case of a future war.

207
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.960
So those are all that's that's a terrific takeoff point for the first quarrel of

208
00:17:14.591 --> 00:17:17.950
seriousness between the two sides which modern historians call the first

209
00:17:17.951 --> 00:17:19.030
Peloponnesian War.

210
00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:24.570
One other thing that happened at the conclusion of this previous period that is

211
00:17:24.641 --> 00:17:25.540
to say with the

212
00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:32.070
with the end of that with the withdrawal of the Athenians from the scene the

213
00:17:34.211 --> 00:17:36.900
Spartans finally took care of the hell.

214
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:42.030
They never were able really to defeat them and get them down from their fort up

215
00:17:42.521 --> 00:17:42.970
on Mount.

216
00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:47.970
It's not me but they finally made a deal with the people up there saying we will

217
00:17:49.241 --> 00:17:54.241
allow you to come down and safety and go away some place so long as you leave

218
00:17:56.650 --> 00:18:01.400
the Peloponnese is they undoubtedly expected that the hell lots would then be

219
00:18:01.401 --> 00:18:05.630
scattered one to one here one there one other place where else would they go.

220
00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:10.810
That's what would have happened had it not been that the Athenians who had

221
00:18:10.991 --> 00:18:13.360
lately acquired we know not how.

222
00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:19.380
Control of a town on the north shore of the Corinthian Gulf called not practice

223
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:26.750
it is so it has a very good harbour and it is so located as to be wonderful as a

224
00:18:28.531 --> 00:18:33.270
naval base for somebody who wished to be able to control access to the

225
00:18:33.271 --> 00:18:38.271
Corinthian Gulf the Athenians took it and then turned it over to the harlots who

226
00:18:40.051 --> 00:18:42.020
had fled the Peloponnese.

227
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:46.590
That was not what the Spartans had in mind although there was nothing in the

228
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:51.240
deal that prevented them from this from being done but it means the Athenians

229
00:18:51.241 --> 00:18:55.950
had done another bit of harm to the Spartans putting their bitter enemies in a

230
00:18:55.951 --> 00:19:00.951
position to cause trouble to them and to their allies on the Corinthian Gulf.

231
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.520
So all of that suggests that on the next day and so to speak after all of these

232
00:19:08.941 --> 00:19:13.941
changes had taken place the world was very different and the prospects I would

233
00:19:14.611 --> 00:19:19.611
have thought for peace between Sparta and her allies in Athens and her allies

234
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:25.730
had been badly reduced is no longer an association between the two

235
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.050
the Athenians have allied themselves with Spartan enemies the Athenians have

236
00:19:31.051 --> 00:19:34.080
taken a hell lots and put them in this terrific place.

237
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:39.690
This is not a recipe for good relations in the future and it would only.

238
00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:45.140
This is where the cliché seems to me to be useful people talk about a powder keg

239
00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:51.420
which only needs a spark to set it off into a great explosion.

240
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:55.050
People use this about the outbreak of many wars sometimes it's an apt.

241
00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:00.720
Thing and sometimes it's not.
This time I think it is as we shall see.

242
00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:05.340
It didn't take very much to produce an explosion between Athens and Sparta.

243
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.380
After these events

244
00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:13.940
and the I guess the spark was provided by a quarrel that took place between two

245
00:20:16.141 --> 00:20:21.141
Spartan allies in the Peloponnese as Majora and Karen's neighbors on that

246
00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:28.240
isthmus that leads into northern and added northern Greece and into Athens.

247
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.530
And since they're both members of this of the Spartan alliance

248
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:43.380
the Spartans had choices to make about what was happening and the choice was

249
00:20:43.381 --> 00:20:47.850
soon forced upon them because when it was clear that the Corinthians were

250
00:20:47.851 --> 00:20:48.780
winning the argument

251
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.200
winning the war I should say that they were fighting against Megaman.

252
00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:59.530
<v 6>Mike Arians came to Sparta and asked them for their help in putting down this</v>

253
00:20:59.861 --> 00:21:01.240
war and ending it.

254
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:06.660
And the Spartans said no we're not interested it's your business not ours.

255
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:09.300
Now that's interesting.

256
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:12.970
We can't really tell because there's nothing written about it.

257
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:19.080
What obligations the Spartans had when two allies who are autonomous states

258
00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.130
according to the theory decide to fight each other.

259
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:28.000
It looks to me because nobody complained about it in terms of constitutional

260
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:32.710
irregularity that the Spartans had every right to ignore what was going on.

261
00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:37.770
We must assume I suppose that in the centuries or a century or so before the

262
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:44.590
Spartans must have ignored other quarrels between allies and allow them to fight

263
00:21:44.591 --> 00:21:46.370
it out or settle it any way they want.

264
00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:51.420
<v 5>The Spartans don't give a damn who wins as between currents and Negara and why</v>

265
00:21:52.691 --> 00:21:53.560
should they get involved.

266
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:58.450
And I think that a hands off attitude must have been encouraged by the fact that

267
00:21:58.451 --> 00:22:03.451
they had just probably was still recovering from the earthquake and the hell out

268
00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.530
rebellion that came after it.
They really didn't need more trouble.

269
00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.240
And so they let the thing go.

270
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:15.820
Now the reason the Spartans could take such a cavalier attitude in the past was

271
00:22:15.821 --> 00:22:19.540
that they were the only great power in the Greek world.

272
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:23.180
But in 461 that was not true.

273
00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:28.430
The losers Negara had a choice.

274
00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:34.150
<v 3>They could and did go to Athens and say won't you help us against cards if you</v>

275
00:22:36.351 --> 00:22:41.351
do we will leave the Peloponnesian league and join the Athenian side.

276
00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:49.550
<v 6>Now that is brought about as I say by the new circumstances.</v>

277
00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.020
This is one of those places where those of us who remember the Cold War are

278
00:22:54.021 --> 00:22:56.130
immediately struck by similarities.

279
00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:02.570
There were troubles all over the world so long as it was known that NATO was on

280
00:23:02.611 --> 00:23:05.640
one side and the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact was on the other.

281
00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:11.180
All kinds of places that neither had any interests and would call on when they

282
00:23:11.401 --> 00:23:15.420
were in a war or some kind of a fight in their own places Africa for instance

283
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:20.820
they would go to one side or the other and say help us or we will seek help from

284
00:23:20.821 --> 00:23:25.270
your enemy.
And that confronted each side with a hard problem.

285
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.590
I don't give a damn what happens in country X you might say but I don't want the

286
00:23:29.591 --> 00:23:32.050
Russians there and vice versa.

287
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:37.090
<v 3>This is the kind of problem that one sees in this situation.</v>

288
00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:42.150
So the Athenians were confronted by an extremely tough decision.

289
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.600
I want to try to communicate to you my sense of how difficult the calls are in

290
00:23:50.771 --> 00:23:51.604
this situation.

291
00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:56.130
Now one natural reaction would be this.

292
00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:01.160
<v 5>It seems to me why in the world should we accept this defection from the</v>

293
00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:07.530
Peloponnesian league because it's bound to anger the Spartans and very likely

294
00:24:08.441 --> 00:24:13.441
bring us a war with the pelican nations which is a very hard thing to face.

295
00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:19.620
What do we care about the quarrel between Maga and Carmen the opposite

296
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:23.630
assumptions would be.

297
00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:29.090
No we don't care about who wins between current and Negara but we do care about

298
00:24:31.701 --> 00:24:34.400
having mega on our side.

299
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:39.910
Because if we control mega if the McGarry ends are on our side Negara is

300
00:24:43.411 --> 00:24:48.411
situated on the the side of the isthmus right next to Athens.

301
00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.990
<v 4>And more than that there's a mountain range that runs through mega.</v>

302
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:59.350
That makes it very difficult for somebody to make his way through that territory

303
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.530
if they are opposed by military force.

304
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:09.400
In short with the help of the mega Aryans the Athenians could cut off access.

305
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:16.510
<v 5>To Athens and probably for the most part to central Greece to the Spartans.</v>

306
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.970
Let me put it more sharply.

307
00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:25.030
The Athenians could feel invulnerable to a Spartan attack if they could control

308
00:25:25.881 --> 00:25:26.714
Negara.

309
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:32.150
Now they would have to know that if they took this offer it might bring a war

310
00:25:32.151 --> 00:25:34.080
with with Sparta.

311
00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:38.090
But there would have been plenty of Athenians who would have thought that is

312
00:25:38.091 --> 00:25:39.790
going to happen anyway.

313
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:45.490
The only question before us is do we want to do have a war with Sparta.

314
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:51.800
On these wonderfully positive conditions or do we want to fight it in the old

315
00:25:51.801 --> 00:25:56.801
way in which we have no way to stop the Spartans from marching into our

316
00:25:58.011 --> 00:26:01.070
territory and destroying our fields.

317
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:06.160
And in fact defeating us because the Athenians as yet had not built walls

318
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:14.110
connecting Athens with the port of Piraeus so that the Spartans could cut the

319
00:26:15.021 --> 00:26:20.021
Athenians off from their port just by invading their territory.

320
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:25.450
And as we know the Athenians do not produce enough food to feed themselves so

321
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:30.190
these would be the thoughts that were going through the minds of the Athenians

322
00:26:30.191 --> 00:26:32.740
and noticed the critical element in your decision.

323
00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:38.130
It seems to me is your prediction about what is likely in the future.

324
00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:43.840
If you think there really is not a danger of a war with Sparta why bring it on.

325
00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:48.730
But if you think there is a real danger of a war with Sparta why leave

326
00:26:48.731 --> 00:26:51.010
yourselves vulnerable to the Spartans.

327
00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:56.670
Whichever call you make there are dangers and uncertainties at the other end

328
00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:00.950
which I simply say welcome to the real world.

329
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:04.310
It's almost always that way.

330
00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:09.700
And it's a beautiful lesson in how real those hard decisions are.

331
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:16.110
<v 4>Well they seem indecision was to take mega into the Athenian alliance and to</v>

332
00:27:16.901 --> 00:27:21.901
take the dangers that went with that and to make their their task easier.

333
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:24.303
They built.

334
00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:29.790
Long Walls connecting the city of Majora with the Port of New savior on the

335
00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:37.560
on the Gulf the Savannah Gulf which is where Athens is located as well and also

336
00:27:38.681 --> 00:27:43.681
to gain control of the town of Pega which is on the I guess I'd say the northern

337
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:49.710
side of the Isthmus and to fortify it and put forces between there.

338
00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.600
In other words to build.

339
00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:58.470
A barrier to Spartan capacity to move into Attica that was the great gain that

340
00:28:00.641 --> 00:28:01.474
they made of it.

341
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:06.940
One of the great prices they paid to acidity says this in his own voice.

342
00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:13.140
This he says was the beginning of Corinthian hatred for Athens.

343
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:18.430
It is a fact if you look at Corinthian Athenian relations in the past there.

344
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:22.720
We don't know a lot about them but what we know suggests that they were not

345
00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:27.470
unfriendly.
They did OK.
No problems really between them.

346
00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:30.670
But from now on you're going to have tremendous trouble with.

347
00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:35.440
And this as you know from reading your subsidiaries and your textbook.

348
00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:41.010
Currents will play a critical role in 431 in bringing on the Peloponnesian War.

349
00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.110
That is the Great War.

350
00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.490
So that was one of the prices the Athenians paid for this decision.

351
00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:56.880
Now if you apply to sit his judgment to the great Peloponnesian War and you

352
00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:05.350
forget that apply it to this situation it seems to me to bring very very true.

353
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:11.420
You said you remember that the growing power of the Athenians caused fear among

354
00:29:12.821 --> 00:29:15.890
the Spartans and led them and forced them to war.

355
00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:21.300
Well there's no question that the Athenian power has grown these alliances that

356
00:29:21.821 --> 00:29:26.821
they have just made and this new geopolitical advantage they have gained through

357
00:29:27.731 --> 00:29:32.620
their alliance with Maghreb suddenly make Athens much more formidable.

358
00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:38.660
And there's no question that the Spartans become fearful about that and

359
00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:44.730
ultimately as we shall see fearful enough to join in a war against the

360
00:29:46.061 --> 00:29:46.894
Athenians.

361
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.860
So I agree with facilities if you're talking about the first Peloponnesian War.

362
00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:55.360
But that's not what he's talking about when we get the one great question that I

363
00:29:55.361 --> 00:29:56.230
would like to confront

364
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.030
when we get to the big war is does it work.

365
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:06.300
Does his evaluation of work for the big I should warn you at once that most

366
00:30:06.851 --> 00:30:11.680
scholars throughout the years have accepted Cincinnati's explanation and

367
00:30:11.681 --> 00:30:14.360
interpretation of the great Peloponnesian War.

368
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:19.480
And I don't so be careful.
He was there.

369
00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:23.200
He knows much more about it than I do.
He's much smarter than I am.

370
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:27.320
So if I say he's wrong I better have a good case.
That's all I can say.

371
00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:30.860
Well.
Not much.

372
00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:34.730
We need not say very much about the war in detail.

373
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:40.870
Essentially the Athenians took the initiative and in a general way when they

374
00:30:43.281 --> 00:30:47.660
fought battles at sea they won when they fought battles on land.

375
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:48.583
They didn't.

376
00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:55.090
No great battles were fought for a couple of years that the fighting took place

377
00:30:55.330 --> 00:31:00.330
in and around the eastern Peloponnese for the most part and nothing decisive

378
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:03.183
happened.

379
00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:08.730
Then we get down towards the year for fifty seven.

380
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:13.800
I keep warning you that the dates here are uncertain but we know these are sort

381
00:31:14.591 --> 00:31:17.470
of consensus dates although we don't have certainty

382
00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:22.300
Athenians received an invitation from

383
00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:28.890
a ruler in Egypt who wanted to launch a rebellion against the Persian Empire.

384
00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:36.490
And he invited the Athenians to send a force to help the Athenians agreed to do

385
00:31:38.091 --> 00:31:38.860
it.

386
00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:43.860
And according to facilities they sent a fleet of two hundred ships for the

387
00:31:45.021 --> 00:31:49.070
purpose.
That's an enormous fleet up to this point.

388
00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:52.710
The Athenians by now have a fleet that's bigger than that.

389
00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:54.290
And they can afford to do it.

390
00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:59.990
But I want you to understand this is a major undertaking.
Now

391
00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:02.893
why did they do it.

392
00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:07.960
They do it because the opportunities in Egypt are tremendous.

393
00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:13.630
Egypt is the greatest grain grower in the Mediterranean area and we know the

394
00:32:14.691 --> 00:32:17.700
Athenians are always interested in sources of grain.

395
00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:23.200
But Egypt is fantastically wealthy because of its great fertility.

396
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:29.350
And so the Athenians if they can gain a share of that wealth will of course

397
00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:31.400
profit from that.

398
00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:36.920
And finally if the seniors are still officially at war with Persia.

399
00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:42.160
So it's perfectly reasonable to try to strip the Persians of possibly their

400
00:32:42.171 --> 00:32:43.580
richest province.

401
00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:47.810
All of those things make their decision understandable.

402
00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:52.130
Now on the other hand you might ask the question now you know you're engaged in

403
00:32:52.131 --> 00:32:56.600
a war with various Peloponnesian and that although the Spartans haven't taken

404
00:32:56.601 --> 00:32:59.180
any action yet you can expect some from them.

405
00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:03.260
Is this a great time for you to tackle yet another war against the Persians.

406
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:09.130
Well they thought so and I think it's evidence of the tremendous confidence that

407
00:33:09.981 --> 00:33:12.650
the Athenians had acquired by this time.

408
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:18.040
And as we shall see it was overconfidence of course this whole story fits

409
00:33:18.981 --> 00:33:23.981
beautifully into Greek feelings Greek ideas Greek religion and mythology.

410
00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:30.560
This will be a beautiful example if Herodotus were writing the history instead

411
00:33:30.561 --> 00:33:35.120
of the very very I'd want to say atheistic lucidity.

412
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:39.490
I'm not sure he was an atheist but was certainly very very skeptical about it

413
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:43.430
this would have been talking about hubris all over the place because that's the

414
00:33:43.431 --> 00:33:48.431
kind of situation that we have but let's let's let's forget about that Athenian

415
00:33:48.931 --> 00:33:50.610
force in Egypt for the time being.

416
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:55.380
And let's look at what the situation is in the year 457.

417
00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:01.680
We have a wonderful piece of evidence rare piece of evidence actually an

418
00:34:01.681 --> 00:34:04.740
inscription from that year

419
00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:11.240
which is a part of a dedication a funeral dedication from a single Athenian

420
00:34:13.441 --> 00:34:18.441
tribe in which they list the war dead from their tribe by where they fought and

421
00:34:21.811 --> 00:34:25.860
died.
And they and they're proud of this.

422
00:34:25.890 --> 00:34:29.730
I mean of course they're proud of the heroism of their men but they're proud I

423
00:34:29.731 --> 00:34:34.731
think also about the range of places that they're fighting unheard of.

424
00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:39.990
One example in all of Greek history in Egypt Sunni Shia Halifax which is a town

425
00:34:44.091 --> 00:34:49.091
in the northeastern Peloponnese is e Jinnah the great island that sits in the

426
00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:51.980
Serrano golf opposite Athens.

427
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:57.550
A China being a great traditional enemy of Athens and mega.

428
00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.590
Of course as you know.

429
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:06.070
So here they are fighting battles and all of these places at the same time.

430
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:12.550
It's a it's a kind of a eight man pounding on his chest to show how great he was

431
00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:18.460
a piece of arrogance you might say calling for vengeance by the gods but no

432
00:35:19.491 --> 00:35:20.640
vengeance came right away.

433
00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:25.660
Instead another victory in China the island of Regina was taken by the Athenians

434
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:28.970
Regina had been a great naval power.

435
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:33.710
So here was a naval power taken away from the enemy and added to the Athenian

436
00:35:33.711 --> 00:35:34.490
side.

437
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:39.490
They now have without question although they've had it really before command of

438
00:35:39.981 --> 00:35:44.030
the seas.
Nobody can withstand them at sea.

439
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:49.510
And they now have complete security from their North Western frontier because of

440
00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:56.860
the McCarran alliance.
And that's not all that happened.

441
00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:03.250
Finally moved I would guess in part by seeing all of this happening and worrying

442
00:36:06.411 --> 00:36:11.411
desperately about the growing power of Athens Sparta took action.

443
00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:17.330
I think they were moved specifically the critical element that was an

444
00:36:17.331 --> 00:36:20.000
opportunity presented to them by.

445
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:25.640
A small region in central Greece called Doris steel.

446
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:29.790
I guess.
It's the root of the word Dorian.

447
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:35.710
This is theoretically the ancestral home of all Dorian's.

448
00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:39.800
So they obviously had friendly relations with the Spartans.

449
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:43.730
The Dorian's were having trouble with some of their neighbors.

450
00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:48.200
One of the standard quarrels between neighbors in the Greek city state world.

451
00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.170
And they asked the Spartans to send a force up to help them.

452
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:57.230
<v 5>I'm not sure that the Spartans would have done so in the normal course of events</v>

453
00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:01.680
because it does mean that they have to get up to central Greece.

454
00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:06.000
When you think about that given what the Athenians have done in Maira they can't

455
00:37:06.001 --> 00:37:07.860
do it in the usual way by walking.

456
00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:12.780
The only way they can get up there is by getting on boats and sailing across the

457
00:37:12.781 --> 00:37:13.660
Corinthian Gulf.

458
00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:19.370
But if the Athenians or those harlots who are occupying no practice are aware of

459
00:37:20.101 --> 00:37:24.300
that they could very well be tagged taken at sea and had their have their army

460
00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.660
destroyed as that fleet is sunk.

461
00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:30.390
They have to sneak across if they're going to go that way.

462
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:35.720
I want you to understand how unlikely is that undertaking in a normal situation.

463
00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:42.110
But what I think makes it not so normal is something that dire Doris of Sicily

464
00:37:43.801 --> 00:37:48.801
tells us facilities doesn't mention which is at that moment the theme ends.

465
00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:54.820
The leading city of Bosnia which had ambitions of its own.

466
00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Always wanting to gain complete control of Bosnia and always having some big

467
00:38:00.971 --> 00:38:02.800
ocean cities hold out against them.

468
00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:06.800
They saw the opportunity to get the Spartans to help them out.

469
00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:11.850
And so they told the Spartans that if they would come and assist them in gaining

470
00:38:13.151 --> 00:38:18.151
control of the OCA the big oceans would join them in an attack on Athens.

471
00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:25.350
And so I think it was that that made it possible for the Spartans to agree and

472
00:38:27.521 --> 00:38:28.354
to act

473
00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.940
they do so they take an army much more than they need to deal with the Dorian

474
00:38:33.941 --> 00:38:36.610
problem.
They slapped that down right away and then what do you know.

475
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:42.210
They come marching down to the Athenian frontier with B OCA to a town or place

476
00:38:45.371 --> 00:38:47.320
near a town called Tana gra

477
00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:54.400
the Spartans of course were able to sneak across the edge of the Gulf of carts.

478
00:38:56.270 --> 00:39:00.080
You may ask why were the Athenians and the hell out so sleepy.

479
00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.450
It never occurred to them is what I say.

480
00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:06.830
The Spartans would ever do a thing like that.
And so there they were.

481
00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:09.903
<v 4>The</v>

482
00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:14.960
battle is then fought and we we're talking about large forces and now the

483
00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:18.860
Spartans send 11000 men.
That's a very big.

484
00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:23.750
They don't have 11000 of their own Spartans end up helping Asian allies go up

485
00:39:23.751 --> 00:39:27.950
there and now they are put together with the ocean forces.

486
00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.290
The oceans are very good fighters.

487
00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:36.200
The Athenians send their army out to the frontier to meet them.

488
00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.530
It's the greater part of the Athenian army.

489
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:45.310
This is a very big battle by Greek standards and the result is almost a

490
00:39:46.671 --> 00:39:47.504
standoff.

491
00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:53.590
The Spartans technically win and that means that they were able to command the

492
00:39:54.591 --> 00:39:58.280
field after the fighting was over.
Put up a trophy

493
00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.000
collect their own dead.

494
00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:05.150
The Athenians of course were required to come and ask them for permission to

495
00:40:05.151 --> 00:40:09.220
collect their dead so there wasn't any question if you follow the rules of hop

496
00:40:09.221 --> 00:40:12.530
like warfare at the time who won the Spartans won.

497
00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:17.590
<v 5>But if we think of it from the standpoint of warfare and you ask about what were</v>

498
00:40:19.741 --> 00:40:24.741
the strategic consequences of the battle that's how today we would say who won

499
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.963
that battle.

500
00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:32.090
<v 7>It was a standoff and I guess you could say the Athenians won because the</v>

501
00:40:32.091 --> 00:40:36.620
purpose of the Spartans was to defeat the Athenians and to compel them to

502
00:40:36.621 --> 00:40:40.040
abandon all the things that they were doing and had done.

503
00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:44.540
<v 4>And in this they failed because they had suffered heavy casualties in the</v>

504
00:40:44.541 --> 00:40:49.190
fighting and were not in a position to renew the battle and to force the

505
00:40:49.191 --> 00:40:54.191
Athenians back or to crush the Athenians in fighting the Spartans simply marched

506
00:40:54.951 --> 00:40:59.180
back into the Peloponnese as the Athenians were in no condition to stop them.

507
00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:01.490
<v 7>So that was that.</v>

508
00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:07.690
And as one sees from what happens after that it really looks more like a

509
00:41:09.531 --> 00:41:14.531
strategic victory for the Athenians because now a they have not been destroyed

510
00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:18.110
they have not been defeated in any useful way.

511
00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:21.470
They have not been stopped in what they were doing and to prove it.

512
00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:26.060
The Athenians take an army northward which is when the Spartans have withdrawn

513
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:27.800
into the ocean to.

514
00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:33.630
Defeat the big ocean army at a place called enough Rita.

515
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:39.910
And the next thing you know establish democratic governments in all the big

516
00:41:41.691 --> 00:41:46.520
ocean cities which are friendly to Athens.

517
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:48.800
I bet I put it that way.

518
00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:53.830
But again in the cold war analogy strikes me as as helpful here in the same way

519
00:41:54.441 --> 00:41:56.600
as wherever the Soviet Army.

520
00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:58.660
<v 4>Was victorious.</v>

521
00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:03.630
Whatever land they occupied there was a communist government set up whose

522
00:42:03.631 --> 00:42:08.190
function was to be a tool of the Soviet Union.

523
00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:11.670
I don't claim that that's exactly what it was in the 5th century.

524
00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:14.490
It's a much more simple and less sophisticated world.

525
00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:16.080
But the general idea is the same.

526
00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:21.580
The guys who run those towns they are partisans of Athens Athens in other words

527
00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:25.680
is the dominant force in the ocean.
I'll step back a moment.

528
00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:30.720
Stand up there on the Acropolis in Athens and look around and you will see a

529
00:42:30.721 --> 00:42:33.540
situation that is so splendid.

530
00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:39.410
It's the kind of thing almost any nation would want as its ideal situation.

531
00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:43.410
If you look to the north you're safe.

532
00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:47.460
There can be no invasion through the ocean for the reasons I've just said.

533
00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:50.190
If you look to the north west.

534
00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:55.840
Megawatt an ally of yours your forces are in there in part but you have that

535
00:42:56.341 --> 00:42:57.360
area blocked off.

536
00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:01.680
There is no way and of course now that you know that the Spartans can take boats

537
00:43:01.681 --> 00:43:05.370
across the Corinthian Gulf you'll see to it that that never happens again.

538
00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:11.120
They're the Spartans and their allies are bottled up in the Peloponnese as the

539
00:43:11.121 --> 00:43:14.940
sea is controlled completely by you.

540
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:21.190
I have also neglected to mention that the Athenians have just now concluded the

541
00:43:21.731 --> 00:43:26.590
building of long walls connecting Athens with Piraeus.

542
00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:32.010
So even if somehow hard to imagine as it is the Spartans got into Attica.

543
00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:38.310
The Athenians need not fight them and need not give way to them because nobody

544
00:43:40.061 --> 00:43:45.040
knows how to take walled cities very well anymore and the Spartans never learn

545
00:43:45.041 --> 00:43:45.874
how to do it.

546
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:51.010
So if you look at it from that point of view until somebody invents an airplane.

547
00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:58.590
Athens is absolutely invulnerable and they still have a two thousand year twenty

548
00:43:59.831 --> 00:44:04.210
four hundred year leeway.
Two thousand years before anybody invents an airplane.

549
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:05.103
So

550
00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:11.400
this is an amazing moment where you could readily think we are invulnerable.

551
00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:13.210
We are safe.

552
00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:17.470
We can do what we like with impunity.

553
00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:22.750
I think this is a very important moment in Athenian and Greek history.

554
00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:27.960
I think then there were Athenians who never got over remembering that's what we

555
00:44:30.311 --> 00:44:33.790
achieved.
That's what we can achieve.

556
00:44:34.330 --> 00:44:39.280
That's what we must aim for in all future circumstances.

557
00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:43.750
And when we get into the Peloponnesian War and there come moments when it seems

558
00:44:43.751 --> 00:44:47.260
possible that the Athenians can make a negotiated peace with the Spartans that's

559
00:44:47.261 --> 00:44:50.110
OK in the war and they turned it down.

560
00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:54.460
I think people subsidiaries and others suggest that they're just out of their

561
00:44:54.461 --> 00:44:58.160
minds.
Maybe they are but they have something they can focus on.

562
00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:02.790
A memory of how it once was and how it might be again.

563
00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:05.373
Well

564
00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:10.930
the gods are not going to put up with this you and I know that the Athenians

565
00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:16.020
suffer a terrible reverse that begins to undermine their situation in Egypt.

566
00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:21.310
There was a terrible disaster.
They lose the Persians defeat them.

567
00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:25.420
There's a great argument about how many ships they lose but whatever it is they

568
00:45:25.421 --> 00:45:30.310
lose a lot.
It makes they lose a strategically significant number

569
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000
the disaster is so great as to cause a whole rash of rebellions in the dealing

570
00:45:38.241 --> 00:45:40.710
in league or the Athenian Empire whatever you want to call it.

571
00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:46.940
And the Athenians will be occupied with trying to put down these rebellions for

572
00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:48.053
some time.

573
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:53.870
The situation by the way that the probable date of this defeat is probably

574
00:45:54.301 --> 00:45:59.160
around four fifty five because it's in the following year and this date is a

575
00:45:59.161 --> 00:46:04.161
good day for the 450 for three that the Athenians decide to move the treasury of

576
00:46:09.421 --> 00:46:14.421
the league from de los to Athens up on the Acropolis in the back room of the

577
00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:21.090
Parthenon which they will be building very shortly.

578
00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:29.670
<v 7>And another important point about that is up to now all money put into the</v>

579
00:46:31.151 --> 00:46:36.151
league Treasury was being used for supporting the Navy and ostensibly for league

580
00:46:39.431 --> 00:46:41.500
purposes usually for league purposes.

581
00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:45.370
But as we know the Athenians could also use it for their own purposes.

582
00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:49.210
They did it faced us but still only four ships and men.

583
00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:55.320
Now the Athenians instituted a new policy and I think whatever you think about

584
00:46:55.751 --> 00:47:00.730
anything before this when the Athenians do what I'm about to describe they

585
00:47:00.731 --> 00:47:05.731
surely have made this an Empire no longer anything like a voluntary Confederacy

586
00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:11.490
because they take one sixtieth of what is put into the Treasury every year as a

587
00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:21.060
donation to Athena which is another way of saying to Athens they are now.

588
00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:28.840
Collecting a profit attacks from the league members which they as we shall see

589
00:47:30.531 --> 00:47:32.930
there will be an argument about how this money is to be used.

590
00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:39.100
They will argue it's our money we can use it any way we want to so that's two

591
00:47:42.211 --> 00:47:44.250
things going in two different directions on the one hand.

592
00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:49.520
All the trouble that they have in the league it leads them however to to change

593
00:47:49.621 --> 00:47:52.770
the character of the league in a very significant way.

594
00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.700
Things are so difficult.

595
00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:02.710
The problem of fighting the Spartans now is so serious that the Athenians recall

596
00:48:02.711 --> 00:48:07.711
came on because they would like to make peace with the Spartans and they know

597
00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:12.550
came on is just the man to do it has no one else can.

598
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:18.710
And so he comes back how I should back up a second there was some talk about

599
00:48:18.711 --> 00:48:22.880
chemo coming back earlier but he certainly comes back and 451 because his ten

600
00:48:22.881 --> 00:48:27.881
years of ostracism are over and it's now that he negotiates a five years truce

601
00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:35.780
with the Spartans with the understanding that the purpose of the truce is to

602
00:48:35.781 --> 00:48:40.781
allow negotiation to go forward to bring about a long term peace agreement

603
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:42.590
between the two

604
00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:48.360
came on achieves that and to show you how ostracism can work.

605
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:53.390
He is immediately elected General it's as though he had never gone away and

606
00:48:54.781 --> 00:48:58.770
being came on he immediately turns to an activity that's a continuation of what

607
00:48:58.771 --> 00:49:02.790
he did before he left namely let's go fight Persians.

608
00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:08.580
And so he takes a fleet and sails to Cyprus which is in the part of which is in

609
00:49:08.581 --> 00:49:13.581
Persian hands and fights a battle against the Persians defeats the Persians but

610
00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.830
has the bad fortune to be killed.

611
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:22.660
And so came on is now removed from the scene in Athens.

612
00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:28.970
I think this is a significant thing because it means that the only individual

613
00:49:32.041 --> 00:49:37.041
politician who had the kind of support the kind of charisma the kind of backing

614
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:44.870
that could challenge the new important leader in Athens Pericles is gone.

615
00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:52.590
And this helps explain why Pericles is still at a relatively young age and is

616
00:49:52.591 --> 00:49:57.591
able to become a person of unprecedented influence and power in the Athenian

617
00:49:58.801 --> 00:49:59.634
state.

618
00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:05.060
It's not that he takes to himself new constitutional powers or gets military

619
00:50:05.611 --> 00:50:06.180
guards or anything.

620
00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:11.180
<v 4>Nothing changes except that he can count on persuading the Assembly to do what</v>

621
00:50:12.841 --> 00:50:13.674
he wants.

622
00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:18.800
Almost all the time and there is nobody out there for the moment who looks like

623
00:50:18.911 --> 00:50:19.770
he can challenge him.

624
00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:24.950
We shall see that shortly that he will meet an important challenge but will come

625
00:50:25.081 --> 00:50:26.790
back to that later on.

626
00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:30.340
<v 8>But let's go on with the story of the war.</v>

627
00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:38.420
<v 7>In 449 two years after the truce was negotiated we find Sparta attacking the</v>

628
00:50:40.981 --> 00:50:45.981
city of forces the policy forces again up in central Greece.

629
00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:50.900
They must have.
Again.

630
00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:54.870
We don't know how it was that they found their way up there but they did find

631
00:50:54.871 --> 00:50:59.871
their way up there and they took back control of the Delphic Oracle from the

632
00:51:02.191 --> 00:51:07.191
neighboring phones who had over the years they had frequently tried to gain

633
00:51:08.851 --> 00:51:13.380
control of the Delphic Oracle from the priests and it was on behalf of those

634
00:51:13.381 --> 00:51:18.381
priests that the Spartans Fought they defeated devotions and went home.

635
00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:24.440
Two years later in 447 the Athenians sent an army up there.

636
00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:29.650
They are seniors are allied to forces and they once again take back the Delphic

637
00:51:31.371 --> 00:51:34.370
oracle and give it over to the potions.

638
00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:40.250
These are signals that the truce is not really working that the two sides are

639
00:51:42.451 --> 00:51:47.451
not finding a way to live together peacefully for the future.

640
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:53.750
And sure enough in the air for forty six a series of events occurs that upsets

641
00:51:56.881 --> 00:52:01.650
the the peace and the balance that the Greek world had found for temporarily

642
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:07.930
first of all there is an oligarchic rebellion throughout the cities of the OCA

643
00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:14.080
and of course they drive out the pro Athenian democratic regimes and suddenly B

644
00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:20.060
OCA is a hostile place no longer a friendly place one from which the Athenians

645
00:52:22.221 --> 00:52:27.221
can expect trouble there's a big argument in Athens as to So what should we do.

646
00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:34.640
Parikh please says let's not do anything we really can't afford to engage in

647
00:52:36.211 --> 00:52:40.350
ground campaigns against serious opponents.

648
00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:43.400
<v 9>We we tried it but we can't keep the OCA.</v>

649
00:52:43.650 --> 00:52:48.650
We'll just have to let the oceans go against him was a general and Athenian

650
00:52:50.221 --> 00:52:55.221
general sometimes I'm astonished by the names that crop up in Athenian history.

651
00:52:57.540 --> 00:53:00.960
<v 4>You wouldn't dare do it you wouldn't invent names like this if you were writing</v>

652
00:53:00.961 --> 00:53:05.961
a novel because people would laugh here's this guy's name is tall Moody's it

653
00:53:06.721 --> 00:53:11.721
comes from the Greek verb told model which means to be bold to be daring.

654
00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:15.270
That's what he is bold and daring.

655
00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:20.690
He marches an army into the ocean to get the place back for the Athenians.

656
00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:25.740
In other words he defeated Pericles on this issue because you couldn't do that

657
00:53:25.741 --> 00:53:27.780
with a get out getting the assembly's approval.

658
00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:32.370
But the Athenians must have been mad too and said No let's go beat those big

659
00:53:32.371 --> 00:53:35.170
oceans up and force them back into our control.

660
00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:40.890
So might as runs into a terrific defeat suffers extremely heavy casualties by

661
00:53:43.171 --> 00:53:48.171
anybody's standards and the OCA is lost for good the battle by the way in which

662
00:53:50.561 --> 00:53:55.561
Tom Modise is killed is the battle of Caro and the CSIRO and a.

663
00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:01.840
Athens is now driven from central Greece and that glorious picture I painted for

664
00:54:01.841 --> 00:54:06.150
you has been marred by a hostile force on the northern enemy.

665
00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:07.480
But that isn't all that's happened.

666
00:54:08.350 --> 00:54:13.030
Seeing that the Athenians were troubled were weak were vulnerable and had can be

667
00:54:13.031 --> 00:54:13.864
beaten.

668
00:54:14.170 --> 00:54:19.030
Suddenly all of the unhappy folks that were around took advantage of the

669
00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:23.260
opportunity on the island of Cuba to the east of Attica.

670
00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:25.540
There is a rebellion.

671
00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:30.310
This is really deadly from even from Pericles point of view.

672
00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:35.620
He cannot permit rebellions in the Empire on islands.

673
00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:39.160
It threatens the control of the sea.

674
00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:43.210
It's not just that he can't have you be a be independent.

675
00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:48.810
You cannot let rebels in your empire succeed because it encourages other

676
00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:51.740
rebellions and they've just been through that.

677
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:55.510
They've had to fight their way through a whole rash of rebellions after the

678
00:54:55.511 --> 00:54:56.890
defeat in Egypt.

679
00:54:57.310 --> 00:55:02.310
So Pericles personally takes an army and sends it and takes it I should say too.

680
00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:05.243
<v 9>You'll be a</v>

681
00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:10.840
and while he is gone with his army often you'll be remembered with with the

682
00:55:10.841 --> 00:55:15.070
ocean now hostile.
There is a rebellion in Majora.

683
00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:19.350
This alliance with mega was always a very iffy thing.

684
00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:22.410
We should remember two things about the past.

685
00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:26.500
One is that mega Ora and Athens have been bitter enemies for centuries.

686
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:29.850
So the alliance was an unnatural one.

687
00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:35.450
The product of momentary agreement but there would certainly have always been

688
00:55:36.001 --> 00:55:37.430
lots of MC Aryans who were against.

689
00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:42.240
And so seeing an opportunity these guys would have moved and the other thing

690
00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:45.630
is that

691
00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:54.790
the Athenians were of course being distracted and their forces were sent off

692
00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:56.270
someplace else.

693
00:55:57.140 --> 00:56:02.140
<v 4>So now Pericles realizes how dangerous this is because if it meant if Negara</v>

694
00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:08.410
succeeds in the rebellion which it does now they have no protection from a

695
00:56:09.081 --> 00:56:14.081
Spartan invasion which they need to expect and that is indeed what happens

696
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:17.863
proclaims.

697
00:56:18.010 --> 00:56:23.010
Having put down that you'll be in rebellion adequately races back to Athens to

698
00:56:23.531 --> 00:56:28.531
meet the Peloponnesian army when it invades and then we have this extraordinary

699
00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:33.830
event in the plains to the north of Attica.

700
00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:41.330
<v 9>Spartans invade Pericles leads the Athenian army out to meet them this is the</v>

701
00:56:44.591 --> 00:56:49.591
scenario for a an Athenian defeat because the numbers of the palpitations are

702
00:56:52.391 --> 00:56:57.391
likely to be greater and their reputation as a superior fighting force has some

703
00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:02.110
merit.
We've seen that it's not going to be a walkover.

704
00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:06.520
We've seen that the Athenians are capable of putting up one hell of a fight but

705
00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:09.940
they can expect not to win is the way I see it.

706
00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:15.660
So they are facing each other the battle is about to happen and all of a sudden

707
00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:22.720
a delegation comes out from the Spartan army Pericles goes out to meet them.

708
00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:27.100
<v 4>They have a little conversation.
They all go back to their armies.</v>

709
00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:32.320
The Spartans led by their king Pleistocene Axel was one who was the guy who was

710
00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:37.380
conferring with Pericles and marched their army back home to Sparta

711
00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:44.850
they declare that they have agreed upon a four months truce for the purpose of

712
00:57:46.991 --> 00:57:49.450
negotiating a permanent peace.

713
00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:53.560
What in the world is going on here.

714
00:57:55.400 --> 00:58:00.400
Well well the Spartans receive the news in a complicated way.

715
00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:03.850
The first reaction is fury

716
00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:06.860
against Pleistocene acts.

717
00:58:07.310 --> 00:58:11.900
Why didn't you clobber those Athenians when you had them finally sticking their

718
00:58:11.901 --> 00:58:16.901
heads out there for battle and they finally take action against him and against

719
00:58:18.381 --> 00:58:22.970
his adviser.
Certain clearances and send them off to exile.

720
00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:26.270
So angry are they at this lost opportunity.

721
00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:31.100
But after all if that's all there was to it there was nothing to stop them from

722
00:58:31.101 --> 00:58:36.101
marching into Attica again and either fighting against the Athenians or at least

723
00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:43.270
doing terrible harm to the farms and the houses of the Athenians out in the

724
00:58:44.031 --> 00:58:47.890
country which at the very least would make the Athenians unhappy and might force

725
00:58:47.891 --> 00:58:50.630
them to come out and fight.
Why didn't they do that.
But they didn't.

726
00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:54.380
And I think that's evidence.
Well it's evidence of two things.

727
00:58:55.670 --> 00:59:00.050
There was a very special opportunity that place acts had lost namely everything

728
00:59:00.051 --> 00:59:04.490
was falling apart on all fronts in Athens at the moment when the battle was

729
00:59:04.491 --> 00:59:07.790
available on the other hand.
That's now.
They've been put down.

730
00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:12.290
You'll be a is quiet and the Athenians have adjusted to everything else.

731
00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:16.250
Still what I've said in the first place is still true.

732
00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:18.880
They could come in and force that fight if they won.
Why didn't they.

733
00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:24.700
I think the answer is because Pericles had convinced placed on acts of something

734
00:59:24.981 --> 00:59:29.981
that was essentially true and that the Spartans when they had time to cool down

735
00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:34.460
could see that there was some reason for doing this.

736
00:59:35.590 --> 00:59:37.670
And it was this that what happens if we fight.

737
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:40.550
Look we only fought each other a little while ago and what happened then.

738
00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:43.850
Well you beat us but you didn't clobber us.
You took a lot of.

739
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:47.450
Casualties and you weren't able to exploit it.

740
00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:52.340
That is even truer today than it was then because if you defeat us what do we
do.

741
00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:57.350
We'll run back to our walls will go through our gates and you won't be able to

742
00:59:57.351 --> 00:59:58.490
lay a pinky on us.

743
00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:02.930
And we don't have to fight you if we don't want to because we own the fleet that

744
01:00:02.931 --> 01:00:04.100
dominates the sea.

745
01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:09.830
We have the money from our airlines that pays for the fleet as long as we have

746
01:00:09.831 --> 01:00:10.940
control of the sea.

747
01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:15.560
<v 0>You can ravage our country all you want so we can get all the grain we need</v>

748
01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:18.840
through imports.
So what are you going to do then.

749
01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:23.450
You'll have taken casualties for nothing and you still won't be able to compel

750
01:00:23.451 --> 01:00:24.650
us to do what you want.

751
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:30.410
<v 5>I think that's the argument that Pericles must have given took place to an ax.</v>

752
01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:35.690
Please don't axe the whole career suggests he was not a man eager for war and he

753
01:00:35.691 --> 01:00:38.480
was glad to have that opportunity to avoid it.

754
01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.930
But the amendment the Spartans could have overdone that and they didn't.

755
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:47.300
And I think it shows you that this was an argument that had some reality and had

756
01:00:47.301 --> 01:00:48.440
some appeal so.

757
01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:52.520
That four month truce was successful.

758
01:00:53.810 --> 01:00:58.810
<v 7>It led to the negotiation of a peace between Athens on behalf of its allies and</v>

759
01:01:02.241 --> 01:01:04.700
Sparta on behalf of its allies.

760
01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:10.300
<v 4>The thirty years peace which is concluded in over the winter of 446 445 the</v>

761
01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:18.470
arrangements of that peace are that Athens would give up all of its holdings on

762
01:01:19.471 --> 01:01:22.980
the continent.
That is to say outside the Aegean Sea

763
01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:29.090
except not practice which they would continue to leave in the hands of the

764
01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:33.550
headlines in tacit recognition.

765
01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:38.530
Nobody formally did it but the point is they let the Athenian allies be included

766
01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:43.770
in the Athenian decision that meant the Spartans granted recognized the

767
01:01:44.261 --> 01:01:47.510
legitimate as the legitimacy of the Athenian Empire.

768
01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:53.540
Then they had a few rules meant to prevent the outbreak of war in the future.

769
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:59.150
And like most of these peace treaties who decide to try to prevent war in the

770
01:01:59.851 --> 01:02:04.380
future they basically look back to how this war started and try to prevent this

771
01:02:04.381 --> 01:02:06.390
war.
Happening again.

772
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:11.630
For instance this war came about because once it won the ally of one side

773
01:02:12.090 --> 01:02:13.290
changed sides to the other.

774
01:02:13.590 --> 01:02:18.570
That was forbidden under the new treaty and somebody must have thought.
Yeah.

775
01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:19.120
I right.

776
01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:23.200
But what if there's a neutral state that wants to go from one side to the other.

777
01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:28.100
And what if that state has significant strategic importance.

778
01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:32.080
Wouldn't that.
Wouldn't that test the peace at all or would it.

779
01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:37.560
And they concluded it wouldn't because they said neutrals were free to join

780
01:02:37.690 --> 01:02:38.523
either side.

781
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:42.850
So in other words if a neutral join one side nobody could say OK that's a cause

782
01:02:42.851 --> 01:02:44.000
for war because it wasn't.

783
01:02:45.550 --> 01:02:50.550
And finally the most remarkable and I believe original absolutely original idea

784
01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:54.690
of its kind ever.

785
01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:58.020
I don't believe there's ever a time in history that we have a record of such a

786
01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:03.540
thing being present I'm talking about a clause in the Treaty which provided that

787
01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:08.600
if in the future there were any disagreements between the two signatories.

788
01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:11.750
Any complaints that they had against one another.

789
01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:17.380
These must be submitted to an arbitrator for a decision.

790
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:19.420
Remind.

791
01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:23.930
Remember I'm not talking about a mediator who says let's talk it over boys.

792
01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:29.240
I'm talking about an arbitrator who has the right and responsibility to say

793
01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:34.070
you're right you're wrong or some version of such a thing.

794
01:03:35.530 --> 01:03:37.960
If that clause had been adhered to.

795
01:03:38.590 --> 01:03:42.670
It's only a matter of logic that says there could never be a war between these

796
01:03:42.671 --> 01:03:43.504
two sides.

797
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:48.990
It's an amazing idea and I'm going to claim with no proof I'll be doing this

798
01:03:51.041 --> 01:03:52.390
again and again for a while.

799
01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:57.960
I think this is Pericles idea because I mean everything that I'm going to point

800
01:03:58.091 --> 01:04:02.860
to.
That's so unusual and unheard of before Pericles is involved with it.

801
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:05.260
And I think he just had that kind of mind.

802
01:04:05.830 --> 01:04:10.600
Very inventive ready to find new ways to meet old problems.

803
01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:15.900
I think this was his notion and I'm convinced it was his determination that this

804
01:04:18.431 --> 01:04:23.431
would be the case that in the future there would not be a settlement of

805
01:04:23.711 --> 01:04:27.760
differences by the threat of war but by arbitration.

806
01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:33.150
That helps explain the very determined position he will take in 431.

807
01:04:33.730 --> 01:04:34.960
This is very important.

808
01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:39.850
<v 9>I don't know how much the Spartans felt that way or knew about what was going to</v>

809
01:04:39.851 --> 01:04:44.200
happen obviously they didn't but they bought it.
That's the treaty.

810
01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:49.210
The two sides swear to it and for 30 years they must adhere to these provisions.

811
01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:53.740
That is the 30 years peace and I think we need to evaluate it to get at this

812
01:04:53.741 --> 01:04:58.390
argument I'm engaged in with the facilities that you're listening in on.
That is

813
01:04:59.950 --> 01:05:02.580
there are pieces and there are pieces they're not all the same.

814
01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:08.210
I'd for my own purposes have come up with I think three categories of peace and

815
01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:16.040
I want to suggest which one this belongs in there is such a thing as a

816
01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:24.510
a
people have spoken of the First World War.

817
01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:26.490
The I'm sorry.
The

818
01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:32.160
peace of her side was often referred to by its critics as a Punic peace.

819
01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:33.600
They're talking about the peace.

820
01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:37.800
They think they're talking about the peace that concluded the second Punic War

821
01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:38.760
with Hannibal.

822
01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:43.760
But no they're talking about the third Punic War in which the peace was the city

823
01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:47.600
of Carthage was destroying.

824
01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:50.800
The castle Virginians were driven away.

825
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Those who were not killed the fields were plowed up and salt put in the furrows.

826
01:05:56.850 --> 01:06:01.530
<v 5>So they thought nobody could grow anything there again.
That's a Punic piece.</v>

827
01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:07.410
<v 9>And there's something to be said for a Punic peace you'll never have a war again</v>

828
01:06:07.411 --> 01:06:12.411
with that country because it doesn't exist anymore that's one extreme

829
01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:18.830
at the other extreme is where I suppose

830
01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:25.420
the winning side can can impose a harsh peace but chooses to impose a gentle

831
01:06:28.371 --> 01:06:33.080
peace in the hope that in the future they will have friendly relations with the

832
01:06:33.081 --> 01:06:33.914
other side.

833
01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:39.160
And so they they they trust the other side even though it's not destroyed to be

834
01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:46.040
good.
And if there are such examples of such things they usually a case where the

835
01:06:46.041 --> 01:06:51.041
defeated side has been so weakened that it's highly unlikely in the future that

836
01:06:51.531 --> 01:06:55.340
they will be a problem or another.

837
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.860
Then there's the kind of

838
01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:04.640
back up a step then there's a kind of a peace that people say was represented by

839
01:07:04.921 --> 01:07:09.921
the peace of West failure in 16 48 that ended the 30 years war in Europe.

840
01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:13.610
In which arrangements are made.

841
01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:16.280
Nobody has actually been defeated.

842
01:07:17.090 --> 01:07:21.530
There is no clear cut winner.
There are no just plain losers.

843
01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:26.860
Everybody has fought so long and the cost has been so great that they decided we

844
01:07:28.041 --> 01:07:30.100
can't hold out for victory.

845
01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:34.930
We've got to cut the best deal we can and such a peace.

846
01:07:37.410 --> 01:07:39.670
Depends.
You know it may work it may not.

847
01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:44.700
It depends upon circumstances in the future that are very hard to predict.

848
01:07:46.790 --> 01:07:48.020
And then we come to.

849
01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:54.650
What I think is probably the worst.
Kind of peace.

850
01:07:56.010 --> 01:08:01.010
One example of it is the peace that the Prussians imposed upon the French in

851
01:08:03.241 --> 01:08:08.241
1870 after the Franco Prussian war in which the big issue was they took Alsace

852
01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:15.980
Lorraine from the French and annexed it to Germany at but at the same time they

853
01:08:17.891 --> 01:08:22.891
did not so harm France that France could never again be a menace but they could

854
01:08:26.591 --> 01:08:31.591
be sure that for the foreseeable future and who knows maybe forever the French

855
01:08:31.901 --> 01:08:36.901
would be angry and dissatisfied and determined to recover Alsace Lorraine even

856
01:08:39.611 --> 01:08:40.510
if it meant war.

857
01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:45.910
And that was true to a degree although that we need to be aware that the

858
01:08:45.911 --> 01:08:50.911
evidence the best evidence we have is that by 1914 the French actually had

859
01:08:51.341 --> 01:08:56.341
pretty well given up on Alsace Lorraine although people kept talking as though

860
01:08:56.710 --> 01:08:58.450
that's why the French went to war.

861
01:08:58.630 --> 01:09:02.860
It wasn't true but also there of course there were Frenchmen who did believe

862
01:09:02.861 --> 01:09:06.480
that way.
But on balance it probably wasn't so.

863
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.770
<v 4>I suppose the best example of that unsatisfactory peace though is the peace that</v>

864
01:09:11.771 --> 01:09:16.771
ended the first world war the peace of our side where the Germans were treated

865
01:09:17.591 --> 01:09:22.591
very harshly in their own opinion although much harsher solutions were available

866
01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:27.910
that were rejected but also they weren't.

867
01:09:28.450 --> 01:09:33.190
They lost a lot of territory and had a lot of restrictions put upon them but

868
01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:37.720
also there was no permanent harm.

869
01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:43.120
That guarantee that Germany would not be able when it recovered from the war to

870
01:09:43.121 --> 01:09:44.620
reverse that decision.

871
01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:51.130
That is the same kind of thing terrible situation in which the defeated power is

872
01:09:52.361 --> 01:09:57.361
totally dissatisfied with the peace and is in a condition down the road to be

873
01:09:58.511 --> 01:10:01.230
strong enough to break now.

874
01:10:01.770 --> 01:10:05.010
Where does the thirty years peace fit in here.

875
01:10:06.670 --> 01:10:09.850
The closest analogy in my opinion is West failure.

876
01:10:10.770 --> 01:10:15.770
I think that the two sides had both found this very unpleasant uncomfortable war

877
01:10:18.330 --> 01:10:22.950
producing dangers and risks that neither had ever anticipated and that the

878
01:10:22.951 --> 01:10:27.951
forces who are in control at the time that the peace was made felt it just

879
01:10:28.261 --> 01:10:29.250
wasn't worth.

880
01:10:30.030 --> 01:10:33.690
<v 9>Having a fight to the finish for the gains that could be made.</v>

881
01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:37.980
And so this is the key thing

882
01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:44.500
if that is true then peace was possible then the Peloponnesian War that follows

883
01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:48.650
is not inevitable.

884
01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:55.530
Scholars argue still did facility say it was inevitable.

885
01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:59.670
I think he did.
Most scholars do.
Some people think not.

886
01:10:59.730 --> 01:11:01.680
But whatever he may have said

887
01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:07.860
that is certainly a view of many a scholar has taken.
So.
I'm saying no.

888
01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:12.090
And the reason I'm saying that is first of all because of the facts I've just

889
01:11:12.091 --> 01:11:15.720
laid out before you.
But I think also here's this is important.

890
01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:20.900
So much depends not only on objective conditions but on intention.

891
01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:26.470
This is one place where historians differ typically from political scientists

892
01:11:26.710 --> 01:11:31.540
political scientists like to have everything.
What's the word I want.

893
01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:37.150
Not having to do with human intention.
In any case they have to be automatic.

894
01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:39.490
They like to be systemic.
That's what they like.

895
01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:42.640
Nations are billiard balls.

896
01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:46.870
You can't look inside them.
They're not made up of people.

897
01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:49.420
They're not even made up of factions or parties.

898
01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:53.770
The state does what it has to do because of the place on the pool table and

899
01:11:53.771 --> 01:11:54.850
where it is located.

900
01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:58.990
Historians like to ask what were the what were these guys interested in what did

901
01:11:58.991 --> 01:12:01.660
they want.
What were they afraid of.
Who were they mad at.

902
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:07.470
That's the way proper historians it's true that proper historians are harder and

903
01:12:08.521 --> 01:12:09.354
harder to find.

904
01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:16.060
<v 4>Too many too many sort of political scientists hidden among the historians</v>

905
01:12:19.170 --> 01:12:20.003
but

906
01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:26.640
the key a key question to whether this war and whether this peace rather will

907
01:12:26.641 --> 01:12:31.641
last has to do with in my opinion with these but these human questions how do

908
01:12:31.891 --> 01:12:33.690
the players really feel about it.

909
01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:38.370
Do they see it as this is the way it's gonna be we want it to be peaceful.

910
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:41.520
Or are they just accepting it because they can't avoid it.

911
01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:47.060
Well I think the evidence suggests that the people who made the treaty certainly

912
01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:53.500
were persuaded that peace was better than war and they would like to bind their

913
01:12:53.501 --> 01:12:56.920
hands to some degree to make it harder for a war to come out.

914
01:12:57.100 --> 01:13:01.780
Pericles I think will prove that by the time we get a chance to examine his

915
01:13:01.781 --> 01:13:02.850
behavior in 431.

916
01:13:03.370 --> 01:13:06.880
But I think it was the peace party and there are parties in Sparta.

917
01:13:06.910 --> 01:13:11.470
As I've told you before that group of people who typically was conservative and

918
01:13:11.471 --> 01:13:16.471
reluctant to risk what they had already for what they might gain in future

919
01:13:16.541 --> 01:13:19.180
warfare.
And I believe that they were.

920
01:13:19.810 --> 01:13:24.810
The normal party in Sparta and this is all debatable but I think that that's the

921
01:13:24.851 --> 01:13:29.851
normal situation in Sparta to break the peace you need for that situation to be

922
01:13:29.921 --> 01:13:34.921
undone by something and events opportunities fears chances to succeed have to

923
01:13:39.881 --> 01:13:42.490
fall into place in a certain way to break that.

924
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:47.820
<v 9>So what I'm telling you is from my point of view it's not at all clear that</v>

925
01:13:47.821 --> 01:13:49.560
there needs to be another war.

926
01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:55.040
Well anybody who says that has the obligation of examining why did the war break

927
01:13:56.851 --> 01:13:59.760
out.
Why did the Peace fail.

928
01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:03.700
And that's what I will turn to next.

929
01:14:04.290 --> 01:14:09.290
I will examine the years between 445 and 430 one in which the peace is tested to

930
01:14:11.611 --> 01:14:14.790
see whether it really had any viability before it failed.

931
01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:16.020
We'll have a look at that next.
