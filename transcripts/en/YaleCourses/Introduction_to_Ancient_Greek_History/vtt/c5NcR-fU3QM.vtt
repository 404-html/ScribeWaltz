1
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.350
Considering the outbreak

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
of the Peloponnesian War the last thing we were talking about was the alliance

3
00:00:13.191 --> 00:00:16.490
that was made between Athens and Coursera.

4
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:18.763
And the

5
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.470
significance of the difficult decision.

6
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.890
The Athenians had to make which you will recall was neither to accept the offer

7
00:00:31.511 --> 00:00:36.511
of the course or means of the traditional offensive and defensive alliance nor

8
00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:42.751
too rejected but rather to make a different kind of alliance than any we know of

9
00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:49.381
before in Greek history a purely defensive alliance which I suggest to you

10
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.040
really should be understood less as a military action than as a diplomatic

11
00:00:56.501 --> 00:00:58.450
gesture as a diplomatic signal.

12
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.020
<v 1>If this is if the Pericles I have in my mind has anything to do with the real</v>

13
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.860
Pericles who existed.
He is.

14
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.930
He is a man who is very sophisticated about the idea of sending diplomatic

15
00:01:13.481 --> 00:01:18.481
signals by action rather than merely by words and that his intention here was to

16
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.580
avoid the unacceptable change in the balance of naval power which would have

17
00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:32.840
occurred if the course Marines had been defeated by the Corinthians.

18
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.130
<v 0>At the same time is to try to avoid blowing this whole thing up into a major war</v>

19
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:42.720
against the Pel Phoenicians by preventing the fighting.

20
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.640
In fact I haven't if I said this flat out but let me say it now.

21
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.850
I think he hoped that when the Corinthians approach Coursera and saw Athenian

22
00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:54.660
ships lined up with the core Syrians the currencies would back off.

23
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.370
And there would be no battle.

24
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.020
And the result would be some other way of getting out of this crisis.

25
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.410
As it turned out his hopes were dashed at the Battle of the Boda which took

26
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:12.801
place in September of 433 to which the Athenians remembered sent ten ships with

27
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.390
three generals one of whom leading one was last dime only as the sun came on who

28
00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:26.441
received orders that were the most difficult kinds of orders you can imagine

29
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.240
giving a naval commander.

30
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.570
His orders were to stay there and if the battle commenced not to engage in that

31
00:02:36.681 --> 00:02:41.681
battle unless and until that moment when it appeared that the Corinthians were

32
00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:47.681
not only going to win but we're going to land on the island of course Sira then

33
00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:53.201
and only then should last a dime odious bring the Athenian ships into combat.

34
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.200
Now how in the world in a naval battle especially where things don't stand still

35
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.200
there either moving around themselves or the sea is moving them around.

36
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.920
How can you be sure what's what's going to happen 10 minutes from now half an

37
00:03:09.381 --> 00:03:10.214
hour from now.

38
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.660
It's impossible to be certain so it would have been a difficult call and I do

39
00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:19.661
think that Pericles anticipated that there might be an engagement which he would

40
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.510
want to regret.

41
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.750
But he could blame less that I'm odious and the generals for doing it.

42
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.600
However that may be
that's all that the Athenians sent.

43
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.770
And again we ought to realize the Athenians had 400 try rings.

44
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.580
They could have sent a couple of hundred which would have guaranteed that if the

45
00:03:46.731 --> 00:03:51.731
Corinthians had fought the Corinthians would have been swept from the sea why

46
00:03:53.181 --> 00:03:54.080
didn't you do that.

47
00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.070
It was obvious again that his intention was not to frighten or anger the

48
00:04:01.461 --> 00:04:06.230
Spartans the head of the Peloponnesian league by such a crushing victory but

49
00:04:06.231 --> 00:04:09.560
instead to employ the technique of deterrence.

50
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.680
<v 2>Now the decision to send only 10 was debatable after those ten had been sent.</v>

51
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.010
The question was raised again in the Athenian assembly but obviously by people

52
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:28.120
who didn't agree with Pericles approach who insisted that there should be a

53
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:33.121
larger fleet since and Pericles apparently could not prevent them sending some

54
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:35.110
more ships.

55
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.110
But the most that could get a vote for was twenty more ships.

56
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.540
So now that there's a second Athenian detachment that is sent some days after

57
00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:50.380
the first which is consists of 20 ships more.

58
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.440
Keep that in mind while the battle which the cities describes in in great detail

59
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.530
works as follows.
The Corinthians do attack

60
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.330
against sea of combined forces of one hundred and twenty is hundred and hundred

61
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:15.721
and ten course and ships and ten Athenians that are there with their hundred and

62
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:19.550
fifty and the Corinthians are winning.

63
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.500
And at a critical moment Plaza de Munoz engages the Athenians in the fight.

64
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.020
And so what Pericles hoped to avoid took place.

65
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.590
And the Corinthians would have succeeded in winning the battle and would have

66
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.740
landed on the island and presumably ultimately taken charge of the current

67
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.970
course civilian fleet when something happened that if it wasn't the very stern

68
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.130
and factually determined facilities.

69
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.350
But it was a Hollywood movie you wouldn't believe it.

70
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.400
Namely as all of this is happening you can imagine somebody on one of the

71
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.800
Corinthian ships suddenly looking behind and looking on the horizon and seeing

72
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.430
ships coming and then seeing that they were Athenian ships at which point the

73
00:06:16.331 --> 00:06:21.331
Corinthians panicked pulled back gave up their victory and withdrew from the

74
00:06:22.001 --> 00:06:22.834
fight.

75
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.290
You can't blame the Corinthians once they knew they were Athenian ships they had

76
00:06:26.291 --> 00:06:27.890
every reason to think.
My God.

77
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.580
Maybe there's two hundred Athenian ships coming at us.

78
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.090
And so it turned out of course there were only twenty.
But it was too late.

79
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.350
And so the battle of supporter.
This.
This land.

80
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.190
This naval battle I've described to you ends in this way.

81
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.580
And it leaves things up in the air.

82
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.700
The Corinthians are have not been deterred.

83
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.690
They are determined more than ever to continue the fight.

84
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.130
And on the other hand the course greens aren't backing down either.

85
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.520
And so here we have one of the issues that will be decisive in bringing on the

86
00:07:04.751 --> 00:07:05.584
war.

87
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.160
Over that winter 433 to 432 two events of importance in this connection take

88
00:07:12.311 --> 00:07:13.030
place.

89
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:18.030
We cannot be sure it's precisely when in that year they took place and we can't

90
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.140
even be sure which of them came first.

91
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.670
I'm in Turgut Turning first to part of Dia.

92
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.080
I'm doing what most scholars do but none of us have any reason to believe it

93
00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:30.400
happened before the next thing.

94
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:35.430
I'll tell you about City of part of DIA up in the Charles Citic peninsula.

95
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.740
<v 3>Those three threat three fingers sticking out into the Aegean from race was you</v>

96
00:07:42.491 --> 00:07:47.491
will perhaps recall a Corinthian colony and it was extraordinarily close to

97
00:07:49.121 --> 00:07:49.560
currents.

98
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.350
Remember when I was talking about colonies and the varieties of relations with

99
00:07:53.351 --> 00:07:54.790
the mother city that they had.

100
00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.930
I told you that part of DIA had unusually close relations with.

101
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:04.910
Each year the currency and sent out magistrates who in fact governed part of

102
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:09.340
DIA.
And this was voluntary on the part of the INS part.

103
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:14.850
So you have a very special currency and part of the in thing because of what we

104
00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:16.930
have what had happened and what was happening.

105
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:23.100
<v 2>The Athenians feared and it turned out rightly feared that the part of the INS</v>

106
00:08:23.381 --> 00:08:28.381
might be planning to rebel against them and to join their currency and friends.

107
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.680
In fact the currency the part of the ins were planning such a thing and in order

108
00:08:34.871 --> 00:08:39.871
to make their chances greater they secretly sent a mission to Sparta in which

109
00:08:42.341 --> 00:08:44.050
they asked the Spartans

110
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.470
just as you may remember the Fijians had done back there and for sixty five.

111
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.060
If we rebelled.

112
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:57.450
Will you invade Attica and I assume it was the F4 as this is a secret thing it

113
00:08:58.061 --> 00:09:00.280
would not have been discussed in the spartan assembly.

114
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:05.320
I believe a majority of the Air Force must have said we will.

115
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:10.810
And so the part of the INS went forward with their rebellion.

116
00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.920
The Athenians before the rebellion broke out but suspecting such things as being

117
00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.620
in the cards sent a fleet.

118
00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:24.140
There was a fleet of Athenian ships that was going to Macedon don't you.

119
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:29.290
Anyway for other reasons and they were instructed by the Assembly again I'm sure

120
00:09:30.281 --> 00:09:31.900
it's Pericles calling the shots

121
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.330
to stop by at part of the on the way.

122
00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:42.310
And when they were in part of the ship to take down the defensive walls that the

123
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:47.320
politicians had on the sea side so that they would be vulnerable to the

124
00:09:47.411 --> 00:09:51.690
Athenians without question which would presumably deter a rebellion.

125
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.930
But when that fleet went out they found that the partisans were already in

126
00:09:57.931 --> 00:09:59.640
rebellion.
They could not.

127
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:06.620
Get at part of it and the Athenians excuse me subsequently sent a fleet to

128
00:10:12.001 --> 00:10:17.001
blockade the city and sent an army to blockaded on the land side and they were

129
00:10:17.311 --> 00:10:22.311
now at war with Potter DIA the colony of cards to suppress the rebellion.

130
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:30.000
The Corinthians responded in an interesting complicated way.

131
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.410
A band of I think the number was two thousand.

132
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:40.480
I think it's two thousand Corinthian hop lights came to part of DIA and help

133
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:47.290
defend it against the Athenian attackers facilities describes them as privately

134
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.830
sent.
That is to say they were.

135
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:58.910
He wants to make the point that these were not sent officially as Corinthian

136
00:10:59.581 --> 00:11:01.400
soldiers they were not in the mob.

137
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.080
We've seen these games being played in the modern world too.

138
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:10.040
They were volunteers just like the 40000 Cuban volunteers that went to Angola in

139
00:11:13.021 --> 00:11:14.430
the 1970s.

140
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:20.450
Volunteers paid for supplied and ordered there by Castro.

141
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.070
That's the kind of volunteers I think we're in part of the.

142
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:30.530
At this point why do the Corinthians go through this masquerade this very easily

143
00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:36.691
penetrated masquerade because they knew that the Athenians under the treaty had

144
00:11:39.911 --> 00:11:44.911
every right to suppress a rebellion in their empire but they didn't want it to

145
00:11:44.981 --> 00:11:45.814
happen.

146
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:50.890
If they had officially sent their own forces to help they would have been guilty

147
00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:55.420
of aggression they would have been guilty of breaking the treaty by interfering

148
00:11:55.421 --> 00:12:00.400
in the other fellows zone and that would have had a very bad effect on what the

149
00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:05.401
Corinthians were clearly deeply concerned about now getting the Spartans to get

150
00:12:05.681 --> 00:12:10.630
the pelican patiently into the war against Athens to achieve the goals that

151
00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.430
Karnes wanted.
So that explains that tricky little business so now.

152
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:21.060
Event number two the Athenians are actually having already fought.

153
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:27.300
The Corinthians at sea in that battle left Soto we're now engaged in a siege of

154
00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:34.231
city of a city which contained thousands of Corinthian soldiers as well.

155
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.830
And yet nobody had declared war on anybody.

156
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:42.730
This is all happening technically during peacetime.

157
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.890
The other important event that took place over that winter

158
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.680
had to do with the town of mega.

159
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.550
We've been hearing about that of course at least ever since the first

160
00:12:54.551 --> 00:12:55.384
Peloponnesian War.

161
00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:02.070
What happened here was that at a certain point in that went to the Athenians

162
00:13:03.731 --> 00:13:08.731
passed a decree of the assembly which forbade McGarry NS from trading to be

163
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:12.940
back.

164
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:17.940
Let me be very technical from from using the harbour of the pirates far from

165
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:24.120
being anywhere from using the agora of Athens or for using any of the ports of

166
00:13:27.101 --> 00:13:30.670
the empire.
I'm being extremely technical and careful about this.

167
00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.830
If I were not I'd be simply saying that they were being boring the McGarry and

168
00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:38.560
trade from anywhere in the Athenian Empire.

169
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.230
I don't do so because one brilliant late Oxford scholar

170
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:51.390
came up with a theory about this event in which he tried to say no this was not

171
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:57.170
a
what he called a.
An embargo.

172
00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.740
But it was in fact merely a of an attempt to shame to disgrace the McGarry ends.

173
00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:12.460
It was when they when East when they the the bill says you may not use the agora

174
00:14:13.161 --> 00:14:16.910
of Athens it means the Agora as the civic centre.

175
00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.920
This is has nothing to do with trade.

176
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.250
I just want to mention it so that I've done justice.

177
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.610
Nobody has believed that theory

178
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:29.630
yet and I don't think they should.

179
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:34.300
It's an embargo and its intention is again.
Well let's.

180
00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.500
Why are we doing anything against Megatron.

181
00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:43.090
I think the best explanation is that when the Corinthians had fought the course

182
00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:48.660
marines and two naval battles remember Luke him me and four thirty five

183
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:50.340
supporter and 433

184
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:56.630
after the first in the first one a number of Peloponnesian allies and other

185
00:14:56.631 --> 00:15:00.920
allies who had assisted the Corinthians in the battle.

186
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:07.210
Now at the second battle the number of allies assisting the Corinthians was cut

187
00:15:10.041 --> 00:15:11.420
down significantly.

188
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:16.930
In my opinion that is because the Spartans had made clear that they wished for

189
00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:23.120
their allies to stay clear of this conflict that they didn't want to be dragged

190
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.400
into a war over it.

191
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.390
And I think the evidence for that is that when you remember that conference that

192
00:15:29.391 --> 00:15:32.930
the course of Athens asked for to meet with the Corinthians and see if they

193
00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:37.931
couldn't work this out the Spartans accompanied them to that conference and

194
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:43.520
clearly that means they wanted such a conference to take place and they would

195
00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:47.600
have liked a peaceful outcome but the Corinthians wouldn't have any.

196
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:53.230
And so I think that it was the clear signal that the Spartans gave that we want

197
00:15:54.081 --> 00:15:54.980
you to cool this.

198
00:15:55.310 --> 00:16:00.050
That explains why fewer Peloponnesian allies showed up to help at the second

199
00:16:00.051 --> 00:16:03.440
battle.
But among those few were the McGarry.

200
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:05.180
Why.

201
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:09.770
Because we know the McGarry has had a terrific grudge against the Athenians.

202
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.350
Of course throughout all of history.

203
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:17.340
But more to the point at the end of the first Peloponnesian War when the McGarry

204
00:16:17.341 --> 00:16:22.341
fans had rebelled against the Athenians in their moment of greatest danger and

205
00:16:24.081 --> 00:16:29.081
then had slaughtered as they had a an Athenian garrison at the port.

206
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:37.030
There was tremendous ill will between the two cities and the McGarry ends were

207
00:16:37.251 --> 00:16:41.090
just going to take a shot at giving the Athenians a hard time.

208
00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:46.510
And so it was important for the Athenians or in any case led by Pericles that

209
00:16:48.351 --> 00:16:53.351
was the way the assembly decided not to allow what the McGarry NS had done to go

210
00:16:54.271 --> 00:16:55.104
unpunished.

211
00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:01.240
Because they wanted to deter other Peloponnesian allies from doing the same.

212
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.330
<v 3>The next time
Well what could they do.</v>

213
00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.820
Well the only thing they're really two things they could do.

214
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.260
Come to think of it before they came up with this idea there was only one they

215
00:17:11.261 --> 00:17:14.600
could march into mega row and fight.

216
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.960
But of course that would be an attack directly on an important ally of Sparta.

217
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.460
It would be a breach of the 30 years peace it would bring about a great

218
00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:25.420
Peloponnesian War.

219
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:30.310
Pericles didn't want to do that but he didn't want the McGarry ends to get away

220
00:17:30.311 --> 00:17:30.940
scot free.

221
00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.720
<v 0>And so he invented a new thing again.</v>

222
00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:38.790
Yet one more new idea which I again regard as fundamentally a diplomatic device

223
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:46.950
meant to deter the kind of behavior that was necessary to deter and that was

224
00:17:49.571 --> 00:17:51.330
this decree.

225
00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.990
<v 4>And scholars have fought forever in a day about all aspects of it and most</v>

226
00:17:55.991 --> 00:17:59.750
importantly about what it's for why it's going on what's its purpose.

227
00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:05.970
<v 2>And unless you understand that as I'm suggesting you should it really is hard to</v>

228
00:18:06.281 --> 00:18:11.130
tell because it could not have done driven.

229
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.600
The McGarry ends.
Excuse me.

230
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.990
How does it help a nation league over to the Athenian side as it did not McGarry

231
00:18:18.991 --> 00:18:22.840
Ns are absolutely determined remain terribly hostile.
Nothing.

232
00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.900
No matter how much they suffered couldn't make them change sides.

233
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:30.880
This was an oligarchic pro Spartan outfit that ran the place and hated the

234
00:18:30.881 --> 00:18:35.881
Athenians terrible Pericles had to know that he wasn't trying to wipe them out

235
00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:41.050
he wasn't trying to take them out of business he was trying to show not so much

236
00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:46.140
them but other Spartan allies that the Athenians could hurt them in ways that

237
00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:55.920
they had not been heard before without going to war and dragging the Spartans in

238
00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:03.300
any commercial Greek state in the Peloponnese and most of them had to do some

239
00:19:05.231 --> 00:19:08.760
kind of commerce and some of the most important ones were right on the seashore

240
00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:13.540
would have had to understand what the significance of this was.

241
00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:19.860
So there we have the McGarry and decree and it is the third of these

242
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.680
provocations as the Corinthians saw that helped to bring on the war.

243
00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:31.890
We would use such terms as the immediate causes the complaints of the the

244
00:19:32.891 --> 00:19:37.891
official complaint says cities would speak of them which are seen or were seen

245
00:19:38.591 --> 00:19:42.070
by contemporaries as being the causes of the war.

246
00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:46.810
And it's important to recognize that the city's whole work or at least certainly

247
00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:51.811
book one is dedicated to correcting what he thinks is an era about these things

248
00:19:53.021 --> 00:19:53.854
in his view.

249
00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:59.130
It's not these particularities that matter it's the true is cause that is the

250
00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:06.010
growing power of Athens and the fear that it engendered among the Spartans.

251
00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:07.930
And that's what that's all about.

252
00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:13.860
Well the Corinthians in reaction to these events Coursera part of the mega press

253
00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:24.330
the Spartans to take action press them to call a meeting at at which point which

254
00:20:26.201 --> 00:20:31.201
would allow the allies to make their complaints to the Spartans and of course

255
00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:37.350
that wouldn't have had any success if there had not been Spartans who themselves

256
00:20:38.171 --> 00:20:43.171
had decided that war against Athens was desirable and were prepared they would

257
00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.910
they they would have had to be influential Spartans who thought that members of

258
00:20:48.911 --> 00:20:53.911
the galaxy up is possibly kings we know at least one Spartan king was not in

259
00:20:56.531 --> 00:20:59.380
favor of it in fact and the other Spartan king was in exile.

260
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:04.900
So this could not have been led by kings but rather by the other two groups of

261
00:21:04.901 --> 00:21:05.260
people.

262
00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:10.260
But it's also clear that the majority of Spartans were not convinced because

263
00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.900
they would not have needed to do what they did.

264
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:19.240
If that had been true they called a meeting of the Spartan assembly to which

265
00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:24.450
they invited all states that had any grievance against the Athenians and of

266
00:21:26.891 --> 00:21:31.750
course you can see that the magistrates clearly wanted to stir the people to
war.

267
00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.770
But they were not capable of delivering a majority.

268
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.800
And so the assembly takes place

269
00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:45.670
and I hope you read that section very very carefully the Corinthians make the

270
00:21:45.821 --> 00:21:47.320
decisive speech.

271
00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:53.670
The essence of it is some of it is just sophistry but some of it is to make the

272
00:21:53.981 --> 00:21:56.900
case let's not worry about all these technicalities.

273
00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.070
<v 3>Well well they might not worry about those technicalities.</v>

274
00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:05.770
None of those technicalities amounted to a breach of the 30 years peace they

275
00:22:05.771 --> 00:22:10.771
were asking the Spartans to violate their oaths by launching a war that violated

276
00:22:13.271 --> 00:22:17.530
their previous commitments and the late Ed later in the war the Spartans

277
00:22:17.531 --> 00:22:21.220
themselves admitted that they were troubled by the fact that they had been

278
00:22:21.221 --> 00:22:22.360
guilty of such a breach.

279
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:27.390
So what the Corinthians was were asking was very very difficult and it meant and

280
00:22:28.961 --> 00:22:32.800
because they so they went whenever they talked about the particularities they

281
00:22:32.801 --> 00:22:36.190
wanted to get past them as fast as they could because they didn't work for them.

282
00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:41.580
Instead they brought in a larger issue that was much harder to defeat.

283
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:46.860
It was a statement about the Athenian character the kind of people that the

284
00:22:47.981 --> 00:22:52.981
Athenians were sort of all tied up in a phrase that the Corinthians use

285
00:22:53.121 --> 00:22:58.121
something like the Athenians were born neither to live themselves in peace nor

286
00:22:59.081 --> 00:23:03.460
to allow their neighbors to live in peace.
He painted a ha.

287
00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:05.050
They painted a horrible picture.

288
00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:11.100
Of a people who of a state which was insatiable so ambitious that it would

289
00:23:12.101 --> 00:23:16.960
always be a menace to all its neighbors no sense worrying about the details at

290
00:23:16.961 --> 00:23:20.530
any particular moment.
They were growing stronger and stronger and stronger.

291
00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:25.080
It was only a matter of time until they fell upon their neighbors and destroyed

292
00:23:25.081 --> 00:23:26.020
their freedom

293
00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:31.600
Athenians sent ambassadors to Sparta.

294
00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.680
<v 2>They had not been invited.</v>

295
00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:37.390
They were there says facilities mysteriously on other business.

296
00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:42.450
I always wonder what other business could they have had with a negotiating a

297
00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:43.983
grain treaty.

298
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:48.990
Was it in exchange for violinists and piano players.

299
00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:51.490
I mean what in the world.

300
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.670
I I don't know because of course I think that was a cover story.

301
00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.340
They were there with instructions.

302
00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.700
The instructions were go to that meeting.

303
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:06.190
Listen if you think that it's important to do so I want you to make the

304
00:24:06.191 --> 00:24:10.780
following set of statements to the Spartans.

305
00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:13.330
And so we have a speech delivered by the Athenians.

306
00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.020
After all the other allies had complained about this that and the other thing.

307
00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:20.690
And
the.

308
00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:27.130
Essence of the Athenian speech I think was first of all they did what they could

309
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.580
to make a case for themselves.
But.

310
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:37.090
The heart and soul of what they said was this came sort of at the end of their

311
00:24:37.091 --> 00:24:38.080
speech which was

312
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:44.750
don't imagine that if you go to war against us this is going to be an easy war

313
00:24:46.201 --> 00:24:49.800
for you.
In effect they were suggesting what was true.

314
00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:54.060
We are a different kind of a state currency and say we are a different kind of

315
00:24:54.061 --> 00:24:56.760
state in one sense but we're telling you a different kind of state in another

316
00:24:56.761 --> 00:24:57.594
sense.

317
00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:02.600
We don't need to do what your defeated opponents regularly have to do that is to

318
00:25:02.611 --> 00:25:04.740
try to get out and fight you in a pop like battle.

319
00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:10.530
Because of our Navy our walls our money our empire we don't need to fight you on

320
00:25:10.531 --> 00:25:13.920
the land at all.
And we own the sea.

321
00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:19.220
You cannot hurt us so you'll be damn fools to take us on.

322
00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:24.120
Don't think you're going to win this war or that it's going to be quick and
easy.

323
00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:28.560
That part of the speech was meant to deter the Spartans.

324
00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:34.100
It is confused scholars who like so many people think that if you want to avoid

325
00:25:34.711 --> 00:25:37.800
war what you need to do is to be very nice to the other fellow.

326
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:43.620
There is no guarantee of that one way or the other but to the other side of the

327
00:25:44.221 --> 00:25:47.810
Athenian argument is very important too.

328
00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:53.900
They said on the other hand whatever grievances you or your allies have against

329
00:25:55.261 --> 00:25:59.850
us and that would have included all of these things I've mentioned to you we are

330
00:25:59.851 --> 00:26:04.851
prepared to submit to arbitration as the treaty requires

331
00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:12.750
in effect if you want to keep your oaths you must not attack us.

332
00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:16.860
You must submit all complaints to arbitration.

333
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:23.730
The Athenians and again I'm sure this was orchestrated entirely by Pericles

334
00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:29.340
hoped that this combination of approaches would get the Spartans to back off and

335
00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:36.390
allow the situation to cool them
the

336
00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:43.150
city's records two speeches made by Spartans at that assembly one by King aka

337
00:26:43.151 --> 00:26:48.151
Demas who was a personal friend of parrot please we learn from other sources and

338
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:54.200
who clearly from what he says here would not does not want to go to war now.

339
00:26:56.170 --> 00:27:00.060
<v 3>And I would suggest doesn't want to go to war at any time at all.</v>

340
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:06.110
And he makes a case against the currency and argument and arguing for delaying

341
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.590
going to war if got one goes to war at all.

342
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.110
And he hoped to put the matter off for several years that he had to do I think

343
00:27:16.111 --> 00:27:21.020
because he recognized that the speech of the Corinthians had changed the mood in

344
00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:26.040
Sparta and he thought that if the Spartans simply voted for on on the question

345
00:27:26.041 --> 00:27:30.030
of war now they would vote for it.
So he couldn't just say let's not go to war.

346
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:35.080
He felt all he could say was this is not the time.
Let's wait several years.

347
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.530
We need money we need to calculate all that kind of stuff.

348
00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.400
And so that was the argument that he made.

349
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:45.720
And he said he backed up the Athenian argument essentially saying this is not

350
00:27:45.721 --> 00:27:48.900
going to be a quick easy war of the kind we're accustomed to.

351
00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:53.580
If you go to war now and this is another memorable phrase it implied you will

352
00:27:53.581 --> 00:27:56.160
leave this war to your sons.

353
00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:00.690
<v 2>That means you saying this is going to take a generation to fight.</v>

354
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.530
That was his argument.
Then on comes the the F war.

355
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:10.340
Who is the president of the meeting on that day.

356
00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:15.380
His name is Sinclair DAs and he gives a wonderfully short Spartan laconic

357
00:28:15.721 --> 00:28:16.250
speech.

358
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:20.610
He says I've heard a lot of long speeches most of which I don't understand.

359
00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:26.210
I'm just a simple Spartan is what he is complying unlike these con men unlike

360
00:28:26.521 --> 00:28:31.521
the Sophist that you've been listening to what I know is these guys are now

361
00:28:31.831 --> 00:28:35.010
laying hands on our allies.

362
00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.930
And he was talking mainly about the McGarry and the creek.

363
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:44.280
And so the only question is are we going to let them do that or not.

364
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.800
And I say let's not.
And then he called for the vote.

365
00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:54.000
And interesting thing happens there too.
After you know have the Spartans vote.

366
00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:56.280
They bang on their shields and they yell.

367
00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:01.020
You know so those in favor those who believe the Athenians have broken the

368
00:29:01.021 --> 00:29:01.380
treaty.

369
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:05.460
That's the way the thing was put to them indicate in the usual way and noble

370
00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:10.350
and.
Those who think not.
Same noise.

371
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:15.540
And then he said I really couldn't tell which side was the louder.

372
00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:22.040
So let's have a division and count which was unusual very unusual in the spartan

373
00:29:22.171 --> 00:29:27.171
assembly at which time he found a very large majority in favor of the war.

374
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:34.080
You know I've gone on both ways on the question of what did he hear and why

375
00:29:34.081 --> 00:29:37.690
didn't he hear the first time and so I still don't know for sure what happened I

376
00:29:37.691 --> 00:29:41.070
mean one interpretation is he really couldn't tell it was very close.

377
00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:43.200
Well why wasn't it close on the division.

378
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:48.330
Because in a place like Sparta you don't want to show yourself as being against

379
00:29:48.331 --> 00:29:50.790
war when other guys are in favor of it.

380
00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:56.580
That's not what brave men and Spartans do even though you'd think that would be

381
00:29:56.581 --> 00:29:57.414
a good idea.

382
00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:02.190
The other possibility is he knew right away there was a majority and a clear

383
00:30:02.191 --> 00:30:03.210
majority for war.

384
00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:07.380
But he wanted everybody else to see how big that majority was.

385
00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:09.620
I don't know what I think.

386
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:13.040
I think I wrote in one book one thing in another book another thing

387
00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:17.590
um.

388
00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:24.300
And so the Spartans voted that the Athenians had broken the peace and the

389
00:30:24.301 --> 00:30:26.640
implication was we should go to war.

390
00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:31.670
That took place at a meeting in Sparta probably in July of 432 but the war

391
00:30:34.561 --> 00:30:39.561
doesn't start or let me back up the Spartans don't go marching into Attica to

392
00:30:41.191 --> 00:30:46.040
fight the Athenians until probably March of 431.

393
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:52.230
Why did it take so long for the Spartans to fulfill what they had just voted

394
00:30:53.771 --> 00:30:58.400
for.
There is no really good reason why they couldn't begin immediately.

395
00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:03.420
Some scholars point out in July is too late to cut down the grain in Athens

396
00:31:03.671 --> 00:31:06.430
which would already have been harvested and put away fine.

397
00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:11.200
But that's not all the Spartans have to do in Athens is one of the things they

398
00:31:11.201 --> 00:31:16.201
do is to go out into the farms burn farm houses destroy as many olive trees as

399
00:31:17.231 --> 00:31:20.470
they can cut down as many grape vines as they can.

400
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:25.810
All of that can be done in July and August and September just as well as it can

401
00:31:25.811 --> 00:31:29.080
be done at any other time.
So I don't think that's a good reason.

402
00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:34.770
I think what happened was that the heat that had been stoked up by the

403
00:31:38.531 --> 00:31:41.230
Corinthian argument and those of their allies.

404
00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:44.830
We only have the Corinthians speech but you can bet the McGarry ends in the pot

405
00:31:44.831 --> 00:31:49.831
of beans and the late on a pretty hot set of complaints as well so did the

406
00:31:49.931 --> 00:31:51.200
island of vagina.
So

407
00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:57.490
it was in the heat of anger that the Spartans voted.

408
00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:02.860
It must be I think that when they had a chance to think it over they thought

409
00:32:02.861 --> 00:32:07.861
that maybe our academics knew what he was talking about and they'd better think

410
00:32:07.901 --> 00:32:08.734
again.

411
00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:13.980
So there is time in this stretch of what is about nine months for the

412
00:32:14.621 --> 00:32:19.621
negotiations that did indeed follow missions were sent from Sparta to Athens to

413
00:32:22.451 --> 00:32:25.270
try.
Well we shall see to try to do what.

414
00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:28.390
They of the first mission

415
00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:34.840
sent to Athens made the demand that there need be no war.

416
00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:39.760
If the Athenians would simply drive out the curse.

417
00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:43.630
Well we know what that is.
The curse of the alchemy on the day.

418
00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.630
Well what out.
Me on the day we talking about parrot please.

419
00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:53.440
Mother is about me and if he's the only prominent alchemy in and around this is

420
00:32:53.441 --> 00:32:58.240
an attempt to.
You could think it to get Pericles out of there.

421
00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:00.610
You guys don't want war.
Just get rid of Pericles.

422
00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.920
Well they knew the Athenians weren't going to do that.

423
00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:08.380
The idea we are engaged here in psychological warfare to undermine Pericles who

424
00:33:08.381 --> 00:33:13.300
they see rightly as the driving force behind the Athenian policies and they want

425
00:33:13.301 --> 00:33:17.740
to make his political situation more uncomfortable and causing trouble.

426
00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:22.390
The Athenians basically say take a walk and that's the first mission.

427
00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:29.640
Next the Spartans send a mission which in my view.

428
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:33.610
So the first one as I say was not a serious effort at avoiding the war but the

429
00:33:33.611 --> 00:33:38.611
second one in my view was this second mission said to the Athenians we want you

430
00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:44.080
to withdraw your troops from part of the.

431
00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:49.810
We want you to leave a giant autonomous as you're supposed to.

432
00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:55.710
And we want you to withdraw the McGarry and decree.
In fact.

433
00:33:56.340 --> 00:34:01.340
If you will only withdraw the McGarry and decree there will be no more

434
00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:09.980
that really change the situation because now in Athens the issue could be boiled

435
00:34:14.471 --> 00:34:19.471
down by the opponents of the war and facilities lets us see that there was

436
00:34:19.691 --> 00:34:24.691
strong opposition to going to war on the part of some that why in the world are

437
00:34:26.061 --> 00:34:30.380
we going to war about this embargo.
We have laid on the McGarry ends.

438
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:32.600
Who cares about that.

439
00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.940
And so in the good fight the great final debate about this issue what should we

440
00:34:37.941 --> 00:34:41.210
do.
How should we answer the Spartan offer on this occasion.

441
00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:47.380
Many speeches were made for cities tells us but the only one he reports is that

442
00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:53.440
of Pericles and Pericles makes the case as to why it is necessary not to

443
00:34:54.561 --> 00:34:59.561
withdraw the McGarry decree and it is the classic argument against appeasement

444
00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:01.970
out of fear.

445
00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:08.140
If we do withdraw this we will do so only because we were afraid that the

446
00:35:08.871 --> 00:35:12.440
Spartans will attack us and we were afraid to fight them.

447
00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:18.050
Now if we give way on this point.
Why should the Spartans ever.

448
00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:23.310
Do anything but threaten us again when they want something that we don't want to

449
00:35:23.311 --> 00:35:26.610
do.
We will be under their power.

450
00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:32.330
You cannot give way to that kind of a menace and still maintain a free hand or

451
00:35:33.661 --> 00:35:38.661
any level of equality with the potential opponent that I think was the essence

452
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:44.700
of what he had to say.
Along with reminding the Athenians

453
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:51.470
how wrong the Spartans were and how inappropriate was their behavior because he

454
00:35:52.621 --> 00:35:54.990
said remember I have.

455
00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:00.200
We have offered to submit every complaint that they have to arbitration.

456
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:04.440
They refuse to do that.

457
00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:10.130
How can we in all honor and in all sense of security refuse to resist that kind

458
00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:15.630
of behavior.
And he won the day.

459
00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:21.080
The Athenians refused to withdraw the McGarry and decree the the course of war

460
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:25.140
was clearly set.

461
00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:30.170
But you know even then it was months before the war began and it wasn't the

462
00:36:30.421 --> 00:36:31.680
Spartans who began it.

463
00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:38.450
It all began when the seasons early or late in winter I guess a 431 made a sneak

464
00:36:40.651 --> 00:36:45.480
attack on the big ocean town of Pelletier which was allied to Athens.

465
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.720
Why did they do it.
Either.

466
00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:53.550
Scholars suggest one of two possibilities either because they.

467
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:58.290
Knew that there was going to be a war and they wanted to gain the strategic

468
00:36:58.291 --> 00:37:03.291
advantage of having mega row which Assad Peltier which is close to the Athenian

469
00:37:03.391 --> 00:37:08.391
border in their control or the flip side could be they were afraid there would

470
00:37:10.021 --> 00:37:14.610
not be a war and they were eager that there should be a war.

471
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:17.490
We just can't be certain about it.

472
00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:21.690
But what we can't be certain about it was the attack on flotilla led the

473
00:37:21.691 --> 00:37:25.260
platoons to ask the Athenian allies to help them.

474
00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:29.470
The Athenians at the very least had to say they would although in the end.

475
00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:34.600
Add in the fact they did not and that would compel the Spartans to come in and

476
00:37:36.031 --> 00:37:37.650
help their team and allies.

477
00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:43.010
And that is indeed how the war began when in probably March of 431 the Spartan

478
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:49.410
and Peloponnesian army.

479
00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:54.890
We don't know how big but very much bigger than the Athenian army came marching

480
00:37:56.030 --> 00:38:00.000
into Attica.
And and the war.

481
00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:02.220
I'm sorry I've forgotten one thing.

482
00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:08.850
Before these the attack on plenty yet the Spartans sent one more mission to

483
00:38:10.901 --> 00:38:15.901
Athens in which they said forget everything we've said before.

484
00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:20.740
If you want peace you must free the Greeks.

485
00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:25.330
That was understood to mean you must give up your empire.

486
00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:28.570
The Spartans did not for a minute

487
00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:35.110
expect the Athenians to do that.
This was a way.

488
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:38.110
This was psychological warfare for what was to follow.

489
00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:41.770
The Martins were to fight the war on the program.

490
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:45.820
We are the liberators of the Greeks against these.

491
00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:53.580
Imperialistic aggressive Athenians who are destroying everybody's autonomy and

492
00:38:54.761 --> 00:38:57.160
making it impossible for everybody to live comfortably.

493
00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:00.420
We are the liberators and that's what we're doing.

494
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:07.510
<v 3>So now we've seen that the Athenians had refused to rescind the decree and the</v>

495
00:39:09.411 --> 00:39:11.300
war had become.

496
00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:18.340
<v 5>It's worth asking why did the two sides make the decisions they did.</v>

497
00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:24.370
The Spartans refused to arbitrate.
Why.

498
00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:30.290
Because their whole system depended upon the allies of Sparta being able to

499
00:39:34.231 --> 00:39:39.231
count on the Spartans to protect them from a third party when it was necessary.

500
00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:45.540
<v 3>So if the Spartans said well we we're not going to do that we'll leave it to</v>

501
00:39:45.541 --> 00:39:47.170
some arbitrator to take care of.

502
00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:52.110
They had to worry that the fundamental reason for the league which gave them

503
00:39:52.111 --> 00:39:57.111
their power and their security would disappear and that would be the end of

504
00:39:57.661 --> 00:39:58.494
that.

505
00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:05.080
<v 2>They also had to worry that if they did not do what the Corinthians and the MCG</v>

506
00:40:06.261 --> 00:40:09.140
Aryans and others wanted them to do.

507
00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:13.460
The Corinthians might leave the league.

508
00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:17.630
That is what the Corinthians threatened them with in their speech.

509
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:22.750
As a matter of fact which itself might be something that would lead to the

510
00:40:23.121 --> 00:40:27.020
dissolution of the Peloponnesian Shan League which is so crucial to Sparta.

511
00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:32.860
So that all of that was on their minds.

512
00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.720
Another reason that the Spartans were not prepared to give way was that they

513
00:40:37.721 --> 00:40:42.721
really didn't believe the majority did not believe what the Athenians said about

514
00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:48.730
how the war would be fought or about what our has said which was to back up the

515
00:40:48.731 --> 00:40:51.470
Athenian claim.
They could say what they want.

516
00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:55.600
But there was no instance in Greek history that ever.

517
00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:00.340
In which one state invaded the land of the other state and the other states

518
00:41:00.341 --> 00:41:03.550
simply let them do what harm they wanted.

519
00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:07.450
No matter what the Athenians might say no matter what.

520
00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:13.030
You might think that the Athenians had the capacity to do that they wouldn't do

521
00:41:13.031 --> 00:41:13.670
that.

522
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:18.670
And the Spartans could point what happened the last time we invaded Attica 445

523
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:24.990
the Athenians came out and made a treaty with us steak they conceded they backed

524
00:41:25.661 --> 00:41:27.850
off.
Why would it be otherwise.

525
00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:32.940
This time I think that you must always be aware yourself when you when you're

526
00:41:33.971 --> 00:41:38.971
thinking about outbreaks of wars anywhere that one of the powerful issue is one

527
00:41:39.431 --> 00:41:43.390
of the thing that helps people decide one way or another is their estimate of

528
00:41:43.391 --> 00:41:48.340
how that war will be fought and what the price of that war will be and what the

529
00:41:48.341 --> 00:41:51.370
chances of victory are.
That's always in your mind.

530
00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.670
You're much less likely to go to war if you feel very confident you're going to

531
00:41:54.671 --> 00:41:55.504
get smashed

532
00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:01.510
or that the cost of the war will be intolerable.
And so on.
So.

533
00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:07.350
That was another issue there is a real link in other words between the strategy

534
00:42:08.741 --> 00:42:13.180
that the Spartans expected to be able to employ.
And the policy.

535
00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:18.620
That went with it.
Now of course they're their guests.

536
00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:22.360
There's a great guess about how the war would be fought turned out to be wrong

537
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:27.820
and very costly to them.
What else could they have done.

538
00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:32.880
Well in theory at least they could have called the Currency and bluff and say no

539
00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:35.150
we're going to obey our oaths.

540
00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:38.740
In the previous treaty we're going to submit to arbitration.

541
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:43.240
Too bad if you don't like it.
What could the Corinthians have done.

542
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:45.280
Well they might have tried.

543
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:50.260
To withdraw from the league in their own withdrawal would not have been
critical.

544
00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:54.550
Only if they had been able to bring with them other states.

545
00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:58.390
We can only guess as to how successful they might have been.

546
00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:03.660
Perhaps it's not out of the question that Negara being as upset as they were

547
00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:04.943
would have joined them.

548
00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:09.820
That would have been a real strategic problem because between the two of them

549
00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:13.570
they control the Isthmus and it means the Spartans can't get out of the pool

550
00:43:13.571 --> 00:43:14.404
penises.

551
00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:19.810
So I don't know how much of a choice that really was.

552
00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:23.230
On the other hand I'm sure there must have been Spartans who said say who's in

553
00:43:23.231 --> 00:43:26.380
charge of this league anyway.
The Corinthians are us.

554
00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:30.280
We make the policy they do what we tell them.

555
00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:33.400
We don't get dragged around by them.

556
00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:38.740
But then the question would be well what if what if these things do happen.

557
00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:43.780
So it was as always not an easy call for either side.

558
00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:51.450
<v 6>After all the Spartans always had to fear the helmets and facilities makes the</v>

559
00:43:52.751 --> 00:43:53.200
point.

560
00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:58.030
I think that it is fear of the helmets that is always at the core of Spartan

561
00:43:58.031 --> 00:43:59.350
fault policy decisions.

562
00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:03.490
Recently scholars have decided to challenge that but I don't think they've been

563
00:44:03.491 --> 00:44:08.491
very successful with that said it is describes the motives that drive the States

564
00:44:10.001 --> 00:44:10.834
to war.

565
00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:16.130
It gives a wonderful try and fear honor and interest and in this case and that's

566
00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:21.850
usually some combination of all of these things.

567
00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:27.570
In this case all of them were engaged but I think fear is legitimately the one

568
00:44:29.021 --> 00:44:29.854
that's prominent.

569
00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:34.860
It's the one that's lucidity puts at the head of the list and you can see why it

570
00:44:35.801 --> 00:44:38.480
might be right.
What about Athens.

571
00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:40.850
Why did the Athenians behave as they did.

572
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:47.470
You said Pericles and the Athenians followed this moderate policy of deterrence.

573
00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:50.930
<v 5>They insisted upon the terms of the treaty.</v>

574
00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:56.530
They insisted upon their equality with the Spartans and therefore on arbitration

575
00:44:57.710 --> 00:45:00.420
no dictation no appeasement.

576
00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:05.400
Out of fear McGarry decree was intended as a warning

577
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:11.400
and I think Pericles relied on the fact that very unusual situation.

578
00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:15.930
Sparta has only one king at this time and that King is aka Seamus who is a

579
00:45:15.931 --> 00:45:19.950
friend of Pericles and who is in favor of peace.

580
00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:25.750
<v 2>Kings are very influential in Sparta and so Pericles might well have thought</v>

581
00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.850
with Arkady Amos on my side.

582
00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:33.050
The Spartans will understand I have no one aggressive attention intentions

583
00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:36.130
against them I don't want to wreck their league I don't want to do anything to

584
00:45:36.131 --> 00:45:41.131
them but they will simply have to arbitrate these problems and they will see

585
00:45:42.011 --> 00:45:43.360
that and he was wrong.

586
00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:49.390
He was confident here too the same issue the question of how to strategy and

587
00:45:49.391 --> 00:45:52.540
policy.
How do they connect with one another.

588
00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:58.860
He believed that his strategy could not fail the Spartans could invade could do

589
00:45:59.971 --> 00:46:04.971
what harm they liked the Athenians would be able to live through whatever they

590
00:46:05.041 --> 00:46:07.230
did without taking casualties.

591
00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:12.440
Simply losing property because they had the empire that they could live off

592
00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:16.440
which would bring them the money they needed to buy everything they wanted and

593
00:46:16.441 --> 00:46:19.230
they had nothing to fear at sea.
So

594
00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:26.210
surely the Spartans after they cooled off would see that they couldn't win and

595
00:46:26.901 --> 00:46:31.901
then why fight because they just couldn't harm the Athenians.

596
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:37.270
It was a strategy that was totally rational and that's what was wrong with it.

597
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:43.870
It didn't take account of the irrationality is that govern human beings.

598
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:49.390
So much of the time it didn't take account of the fact that the Spartans were

599
00:46:49.431 --> 00:46:54.431
both angry and frightened and finally that the Spartans didn't have the

600
00:46:55.971 --> 00:47:00.110
imagination and I mean I don't want to put the Spartans down as particularly

601
00:47:00.111 --> 00:47:01.280
blind in this respect.

602
00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:05.870
Seems to me all Greeks would have had the same doubts didn't have the

603
00:47:05.871 --> 00:47:09.500
imagination to think that anybody would do what Pericles had in mind and even if

604
00:47:09.501 --> 00:47:13.670
it was explained to them they'd say they won't do it because to do so from the

605
00:47:13.671 --> 00:47:18.671
Spartan and Greek perspective would be cowardly and would the Athenians be

606
00:47:19.071 --> 00:47:23.300
willing to be shown up to be such terrible cowards as they would have to be

607
00:47:23.301 --> 00:47:27.680
standing behind their walls watching the Spartans ripping up their homes

608
00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:32.660
destroying their crops and calling them every name in the book of as they

609
00:47:32.661 --> 00:47:36.800
shouted beneath their walls.
They thought not.

610
00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:39.013
And so

611
00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:46.410
Pericles and the Athenians I think went wrong as the Spartans did really in

612
00:47:46.841 --> 00:47:49.390
anticipating what was going to happen.

613
00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:55.440
And finally I would make this point and make it as a general point about the

614
00:47:55.511 --> 00:47:57.500
outbreaks of wars anywhere anytime.

615
00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:02.740
And that is if you are going to use a strategy of deterrence.

616
00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:09.090
You must have available to you a powerful offensive threat.

617
00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:15.150
It's one thing to say as Pericles was in effect saying you can't hurt me so

618
00:48:15.151 --> 00:48:15.984
don't fight.

619
00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:22.350
You have to be able to show the enemy I can hurt you very badly so don't fight.

620
00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:29.070
And Pericles had no intention of employing anything like a very serious

621
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:30.910
offensive threat.

622
00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:35.050
There were ways he might have been able to do this or that but that was not what

623
00:48:35.051 --> 00:48:35.884
was on his mind.

624
00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:40.660
He he expected that the Spartans would behave fundamentally rationally.

625
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:44.590
They would calculate their chances of victory they would see they had none and

626
00:48:44.591 --> 00:48:49.591
they would negotiate which means accept arbitration and get out of this fix

627
00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:53.340
in my view.

628
00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:58.880
Neither side wanted war but neither side was ready to yield for the reasons that

629
00:49:01.671 --> 00:49:02.720
I have suggested.

630
00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:09.140
It's not that this was in my view an irrepressible conflict.

631
00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:15.470
<v 6>I use the terminology of the American Civil War because really that's what</v>

632
00:49:15.471 --> 00:49:20.471
facilities are saying about the palpitation war that it was an irrepressible

633
00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:22.530
conflict.
I think not.

634
00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:27.620
I think mistakes were made mistakes of judgment on both sides that produced the

635
00:49:30.211 --> 00:49:31.044
outcome.

636
00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:35.400
Both sides felt that they could not back down.

637
00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:40.940
And as Lincoln would say of his great war and the war came I don't really think

638
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.110
it was the case of one side deciding let's have a war.

639
00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:54.740
I think it was they both stumbled into it as a consequence of the situation and

640
00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:59.490
their misunderstandings of what was going on.

641
00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:03.253
<v 2>So</v>

642
00:50:04.350 --> 00:50:09.350
now to turn to the war itself I have long ago concluded that running through the

643
00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:16.041
war at the pace that's available to me in time would be so too superficial to be

644
00:50:17.371 --> 00:50:18.630
anything but silly.

645
00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:23.040
<v 6>So I won't try to tell you what happened in the war but you have a pretty good</v>

646
00:50:23.041 --> 00:50:28.041
informant there his name is facilities and your textbook can fill the rest of it

647
00:50:28.981 --> 00:50:33.981
in what I'd like to do in the time available to me to talk about the war is to

648
00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:39.410
pursue a couple of topics in some depth to help you understand some aspects of

649
00:50:40.231 --> 00:50:45.231
the war rather than the hopeless effort to describe the war to you so briefly.

650
00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:52.360
So I wanted to talk to you first about the main source that we have for

651
00:50:54.541 --> 00:50:59.541
understanding the war and that the great historian who wrote it through cities

652
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:04.420
in his history of the war
I'd like to.

653
00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:09.720
I guess if when I when I give this as a separate talk to people I would use the

654
00:51:10.601 --> 00:51:15.601
title facilities the revisionist historian of the Peloponnesian War and let me

655
00:51:17.050 --> 00:51:22.050
just do that for you not just that title ought to raise a number of questions.

656
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:26.940
Who is this guy.
Who is this Cincinnati's.

657
00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:32.340
Why should we be interested in what he wrote us over twenty four hundred years

658
00:51:32.411 --> 00:51:33.244
ago.

659
00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:38.700
<v 5>Also what is a revisionist and how can two cities be revisionist when he seems</v>

660
00:51:40.751 --> 00:51:43.850
to have been the first man to write a history of the Peloponnesian War.

661
00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:46.860
What was there for him to revise.

662
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Well facilities was an Athenian aristocrat who came of age at the height of the

663
00:51:55.231 --> 00:51:59.220
greatness of prickly and Athens.
He appears to have been born.

664
00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:04.250
Let us say about 460 B.C. he was not yet 30 when the Great War broke out.

665
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:10.150
With two interruptions.

666
00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:15.210
That war lasted for twenty seven years and left Greece shattered impoverished

667
00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.400
and permanently weakened.

668
00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:24.360
Never again were the Greeks masters of their fate and that war was his subject.

669
00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:31.580
But why should a war among the ancient Greeks interest us today.

670
00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:36.560
One answer lies in facilities definition of his task

671
00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:42.890
and in the skill in which he carried it out he said it may well be that my

672
00:52:42.891 --> 00:52:47.891
history will seem less easy to read and he means here less easy to read than

673
00:52:48.591 --> 00:52:51.890
Herodotus.
With all those mournful funny stories he tells.

674
00:52:53.490 --> 00:52:57.320
Because of the absence in it of a romantic element.

675
00:52:57.810 --> 00:52:59.280
Take that Herodotus.

676
00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:05.830
It will be enough for me however if these words of mine are judged useful for

677
00:53:06.471 --> 00:53:11.471
those who want to understand clearly the events that happened in the past and

678
00:53:13.581 --> 00:53:18.581
which human nature being what it is will at some time or other and in much the

679
00:53:18.621 --> 00:53:21.140
same ways be repeated in the future.

680
00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:27.320
My work is not a piece of writing designed to meet tastes of an immediate public

681
00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:34.490
like Herodotus is who read his history out in public readings.

682
00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:39.560
My work is a possession forever.

683
00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:46.790
That may sound immodest but his expectation obviously was justified.

684
00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:51.650
For his work has lasted and been judged useful to this very day.

685
00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:57.660
Perhaps more influential in our time than any time before.

686
00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:03.840
But what's a revisionist in a sense of course all historians are revisionist for

687
00:54:04.031 --> 00:54:08.470
each tries to make some contribution that changes our understanding of the past

688
00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:14.490
when we use the term revisionist we referred to a writer who tries to change the

689
00:54:14.921 --> 00:54:19.921
reader's mind in a major way to provide a new general interpretation sharply and

690
00:54:22.721 --> 00:54:26.200
thoroughly to change our way of looking at the matter.

691
00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:30.170
The term seems to have been used first.

692
00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:35.730
After the First World War most people who lived in the Allied nations believed

693
00:54:35.831 --> 00:54:40.330
that the Central Powers were responsible for bringing it on and deserved to be

694
00:54:40.331 --> 00:54:41.164
punished for it.

695
00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:47.550
Soon after the war some people began to argue that Germany and Austria when no

696
00:54:48.041 --> 00:54:53.041
more responsible than Russia France and England and perhaps less soon historians

697
00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:58.270
called revisionists argued in support of that position.

698
00:54:59.050 --> 00:55:04.050
Before long the new view captured the minds of educated people in England and

699
00:55:05.951 --> 00:55:10.951
America even some Frenchmen were convinced and the Bolshevik government of

700
00:55:11.461 --> 00:55:16.170
France of Russia did not need convincing of the wickedness of their Charest

701
00:55:16.171 --> 00:55:20.710
regime.
Since then the phenomenon has been common.

702
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.770
A few writers most notably a JP Taylor tried to revise the common opinion that

703
00:55:26.771 --> 00:55:29.770
held Hitler responsible for the second world war.

704
00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.060
And had great success for a while later.

705
00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:38.080
The causes of the Cold War and of the American war in Vietnam underwent similar

706
00:55:38.081 --> 00:55:43.081
treatment these attempts to reverse opinion have had great practical importance.

707
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:49.990
What happened in the past and even more important what we think happened has a

708
00:55:50.971 --> 00:55:55.290
powerful influence on the way we respond to our current problems.

709
00:55:56.730 --> 00:56:01.730
What historians say happened and what they say it means therefore makes a very

710
00:56:02.911 --> 00:56:03.744
great difference.

711
00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:09.140
Let me just remind you about the controversy about the First World War to

712
00:56:09.141 --> 00:56:10.310
illustrate that point.

713
00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:15.640
The Americans and the English in particular came to feel that Germany was

714
00:56:15.641 --> 00:56:20.641
wrongly blamed and therefore unjustly treated by the vast PSI treaty Americans

715
00:56:22.021 --> 00:56:27.021
use this as the main justification for rejecting that treaty and then retreating

716
00:56:28.411 --> 00:56:33.411
into isolation from foreign affairs the English of course couldn't go that far

717
00:56:33.570 --> 00:56:38.570
but their belief that Germany was falsely accused made it easy to permit and to

718
00:56:38.611 --> 00:56:41.430
justify Hitler's violations of the treaty.

719
00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:47.240
Feelings of guilt helped support a policy of disarmament unpreparedness and

720
00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:50.770
appeasement the English poet W.H.

721
00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:54.310
Auden responding to Hitler's invasion of Poland.

722
00:56:55.120 --> 00:57:00.120
In a poem called September 1st 1939 a poem that was subsequently deleted from

723
00:57:03.701 --> 00:57:08.701
collections of his poetry revealed how deeply the idea had penetrated and how

724
00:57:09.311 --> 00:57:13.270
late in spite of everything it lasted.
Here's what he says.

725
00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:18.100
Accurate scholarship can unearth the whole offense from Luther.

726
00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:23.340
Until now that has driven a culture mad find what occurred at Linz what huge

727
00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:30.690
embargo made a psychopathic God eye and the public know what all school children

728
00:57:32.861 --> 00:57:37.861
learn those to whom evil is done do evil in return.

729
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:43.430
<v 2>So we are to understand Hitler and Nazi Germany as simply responding to the bad</v>

730
00:57:43.981 --> 00:57:47.230
deal they got at the Battle of ASI.
And that's all there is.

731
00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:53.130
More recent scholarship is shown to most people's satisfaction that the opinions

732
00:57:53.131 --> 00:57:58.131
of contemporaries were more right than the revisionists that the general blamed

733
00:57:58.201 --> 00:58:02.850
for the first world war can be laid at Germany's door and that guilty feelings

734
00:58:02.851 --> 00:58:04.830
were unjustified.
But it's too late.

735
00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:10.820
<v 5>The Revisionist historians did their work so well and it fits so nicely into the</v>

736
00:58:11.341 --> 00:58:16.341
climate of opinion of the 1920s and 30s that these people capture the minds of a

737
00:58:17.671 --> 00:58:21.870
generation and helped to move them in a direction that they wanted to go.

738
00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:27.770
So what historians write and what teachers teach can really matter

739
00:58:29.290 --> 00:58:33.320
mostly in the negative.
I mean if we teach you anything right you forget it.

740
00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:34.820
But if we get it wrong you remember

741
00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:41.440
the 70s as much as anyone who has ever written believed in the practical

742
00:58:41.721 --> 00:58:46.670
importance of history so we should expect him to be eager to set straight.

743
00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:49.760
Any errors of fact or interpretation that he found

744
00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:55.840
but his revisionist tendencies are clear on a larger scale than detail.

745
00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:01.920
He has the evidence of Homer for instance to show he uses it that it was the

746
00:59:02.431 --> 00:59:07.290
poverty of the Greeks not the bravery of the Trojans that made the siege of Troy

747
00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:12.070
so long.
He also seems to have been the first one to present the view that the

748
00:59:12.071 --> 00:59:17.071
Peloponnesian War was one single conflict that began in 431 ended in 427 not a

749
00:59:19.121 --> 00:59:20.740
series of separate wars

750
00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:27.600
but my question again is what was there to revise the answer I think is the same

751
00:59:28.570 --> 00:59:33.570
as in the modern instances I mentioned they're not yet fully formed or written

752
00:59:35.290 --> 00:59:40.290
opinions of contemporaries in modern times these are very easy to recover.

753
00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:46.030
Some of us still remember them and in any case modern revisionists always

754
00:59:46.031 --> 00:59:51.031
confront and argue against them facilities method is different he argues with no

755
00:59:53.241 --> 00:59:56.120
way.
And he presents the alternative view.

756
00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:01.340
<v 2>I'm sorry.
He vents no alternative view even to refute it.</v>

757
01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:06.700
There are a couple of exceptions but even then he doesn't mention anybody who

758
01:00:07.491 --> 01:00:11.480
holds the view he's going to refute.
He just puts forward the view.

759
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:17.950
<v 5>He gives the reader only the necessary facts and conclusions that he has</v>

760
01:00:17.961 --> 01:00:19.160
distilled from them.

761
01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:25.270
After careful investigation and thought he has been so successful.

762
01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:31.330
That for more than twenty four hundred years few readers have been aware that

763
01:00:32.301 --> 01:00:34.070
any other opinion existed.

764
01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:37.850
But a careful reading of facilities himself.

765
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:43.390
And of a few other ancient sources shows that there were other opinions in

766
01:00:43.621 --> 01:00:48.621
subsidiaries time and that his history is a powerful and effective polemic

767
01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:50.923
against them.

768
01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:57.650
One interesting dispute involved the causes of and responsibility for the war

769
01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:02.300
which I've been chatting about to the ordinary contemporary.

770
01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:08.200
The war must have seemed the result of a series of incidents beginning about 436

771
01:01:10.311 --> 01:01:15.311
B.C. at epidemics there a civil war brought about the conflict with Coursera the

772
01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:22.640
quarrels threaten the general peace when Athens made an alliance

773
01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:28.970
I'm sorry with Coursera against Bard as currency an ally during the winter.

774
01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:29.973
Potter.

775
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:32.690
<v 3>I'm not going to go through that because you know all about it.</v>

776
01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:39.550
<v 5>The opposition to the war I remind you focused on the McGarry and the Korea as</v>

777
01:01:39.551 --> 01:01:44.551
its cause and held Pericles responsible for both the decree and the war.

778
01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:49.410
In four twenty five.

779
01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:54.820
The comic poet Aristophanes presented a play called accordions the war had by

780
01:01:56.661 --> 01:02:00.950
that time dragged on for six long and painful years.

781
01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:06.880
And his comic hero decaying populace has decided to make a separate peace for

782
01:02:07.701 --> 01:02:08.534
himself.

783
01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:13.610
This so angers the patriotic and bellicose chorus.

784
01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:18.860
That the hero is forced to explain that it was not the Spartans who began the

785
01:02:18.861 --> 01:02:21.770
war.
Here's what D.K.
populist says.

786
01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:26.150
Some vise ridden wretches men have no honor.

787
01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:29.510
False men not even real citizens.

788
01:02:30.050 --> 01:02:35.050
They kept denouncing mega as little coats and if everyone anyone ever saw a

789
01:02:36.231 --> 01:02:41.231
cucumber a hair a suckling pig a clove of garlic or a lump of salt All were

790
01:02:44.331 --> 01:02:47.300
denounced as McGarry in and confiscated.

791
01:02:48.490 --> 01:02:53.020
Then he goes on some drunken Athenians stole McGarry and woman

792
01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:59.800
and in return some McGarry NS stole three prostitutes from the House of SPCA

793
01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:04.610
Pericles mistress next.

794
01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:09.730
The infuriated Pericles I quote again enacted laws which sounded like drinking

795
01:03:11.451 --> 01:03:16.290
songs that make Aryans must leave our land our own market.

796
01:03:16.310 --> 01:03:21.310
I would see our continent then when the big Aryans were slowly starving.

797
01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:26.330
They begged the Spartans to get the law of the three harlots withdrawn.

798
01:03:27.790 --> 01:03:32.790
We refused though they asked us often and from that came the clash of Shield's

799
01:03:35.490 --> 01:03:39.840
now using the evidence of Athenian comedy to understand contemporary politics is

800
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:41.040
a tricky business.

801
01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:46.980
Just imagine the trouble somebody two thousand years from now would have making

802
01:03:47.711 --> 01:03:52.711
sense of a Jay Leno monologue or a skit from Saturday Night Live.

803
01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:59.360
Aristophanes is clearly having fun by connecting the McGarry and decree which we

804
01:03:59.551 --> 01:04:04.551
know was supported by Pericles with the rape of women which according to Homer

805
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:06.840
started the Trojan War.

806
01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:10.710
And according to Herodotus was said to have caused the war between the Greeks

807
01:04:10.711 --> 01:04:11.920
and the Persians as well.

808
01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:18.260
Still he does make the McGarry and decree and the Athenian refusal to withdraw

809
01:04:18.261 --> 01:04:18.890
it.

810
01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:23.890
Central to the coming of the war both in accordions and then another company

811
01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:29.440
another comedy he wrote called Peace performed and for twenty one in the latter

812
01:04:29.701 --> 01:04:34.701
play he makes Hermes the God explained to the war weary Athenian farmers how

813
01:04:36.031 --> 01:04:37.980
peace was lost in the first place.

814
01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:43.040
I quote the beginning of our trouble was the disgrace of Phineas.

815
01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:48.290
He's referring to the great sculptor who had been charged with piety in

816
01:04:50.191 --> 01:04:54.960
connection with the great statue of Athena that he had constructed for the

817
01:04:54.961 --> 01:04:59.961
Parthenon then parolees fearing he might share in the misfortune because Phineas

818
01:05:02.551 --> 01:05:06.000
was his close friend dreading your ill nature.

819
01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:09.000
That is the Athenians and your stubborn ways.

820
01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:11.190
Before he could suffer harm.

821
01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:16.370
Set the city aflame with that little spark that McGarry and decree well the full

822
01:05:18.091 --> 01:05:22.950
context reveals that the connection between the attacks on the great sculptor

823
01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:27.780
Phineas Pericles friend and associate and the McGarry and the Cree was

824
01:05:27.781 --> 01:05:29.580
Aristophanes own joke.

825
01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:35.760
But it was taken seriously by other ancient writers and it surely reflected

826
01:05:36.221 --> 01:05:41.221
charges that were made by real contemporary enemies of Pericles the hard Colonel

827
01:05:43.091 --> 01:05:45.730
of opinion central to all this.

828
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:51.990
Is the common belief that the cause of the war was the McGarry and decree and

829
01:05:52.331 --> 01:05:55.150
that Pericles was responsible for.

830
01:05:56.730 --> 01:06:01.730
Well of course that view at the very most is an oversimplification and any good

831
01:06:03.271 --> 01:06:07.030
historian would have rejected it as a sufficient explanation.

832
01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:11.150
Said it is in fact gives it very little attention.

833
01:06:12.110 --> 01:06:15.410
He doesn't mention it in its natural place in the narrative.

834
01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:17.380
He doesn't give it date.

835
01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:21.350
He doesn't tell us the purpose or he doesn't and he doesn't tell us how it

836
01:06:21.351 --> 01:06:24.920
worked in practice.
He does not conceal the fact.

837
01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:30.370
That the piece was conditional on its withdrawal or that it became the center of

838
01:06:30.831 --> 01:06:35.820
the final debate in Athens his way of refuting the common opinion was to

839
01:06:35.821 --> 01:06:40.821
indicate it's unimportant it by the small place it occupies in his account.

840
01:06:42.210 --> 01:06:46.740
And to included among all the specific quarrels that he regards as insignificant

841
01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:52.760
his own explicit interpretation is a sweeping revision of the usual explanation

842
01:06:55.711 --> 01:07:00.711
and it's the one I've told you about before and he states that same explanation

843
01:07:00.930 --> 01:07:05.930
in other words twice more in his account of the war's origins and the whole

844
01:07:06.511 --> 01:07:11.511
first book is a carefully organized unit meant to support that interpretation

845
01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:20.060
and so skillfully and powerfully did he work that his interpretation has

846
01:07:20.401 --> 01:07:23.970
convinced all but a few readers over the centuries.

847
01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:30.510
I should point out that in spite of my clearing up that error.

848
01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:33.090
It's been available for about 40 years now.

849
01:07:33.330 --> 01:07:36.900
I hate to tell you but most people still agree with facilities and not with me.

850
01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:44.510
The revisionist view quickly and last thing Lee became orthodoxy

851
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:51.910
another controversy surrounds Paris police most unusual strategy for waging the

852
01:07:53.391 --> 01:07:57.620
war.
And I'll talk to you about that next time.

853
01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:03.220
<v 7>So let me move on to the next point.</v>

854
01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:23.913
Here we go.

855
01:08:33.690 --> 01:08:34.650
Sorry about this

856
01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:42.853
point I want to make.

857
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:48.430
<v 6>In any case the other instance that I want to bring to your attention is in the</v>

858
01:08:49.021 --> 01:08:54.021
summary that subsidies makes of Pericles career and of his importance to Athens

859
01:08:56.850 --> 01:09:01.850
in Chapter 65 of book 2 after Pericles death.

860
01:09:02.130 --> 01:09:06.150
He interrupts the narrative to give this really lengthy evaluation.

861
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:11.850
One of the things he says in that evaluation is that

862
01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:18.390
Athens in the time of Pericles was a democracy in name but the rule of the first

863
01:09:22.121 --> 01:09:27.121
citizen in fact that is a remarkably powerful statement.

864
01:09:28.410 --> 01:09:29.340
He is saying that

865
01:09:31.410 --> 01:09:36.180
apparently in Athens was not a democracy and that it was

866
01:09:38.010 --> 01:09:43.010
in effect some kind of an autocratic government with Pericles as the autocrat.

867
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:53.630
I would say that all the evidence we have suggests that that is not accurate.

868
01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:59.310
<v 4>Just a few points to illustrate why that is so.</v>

869
01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:01.840
I mean you want one way to do that I think is by comparison.

870
01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:06.430
People have suggested what that what some cities are saying is like what

871
01:10:06.490 --> 01:10:11.490
Augustus the Emperor of Rome said about himself that he ruled not by any

872
01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:18.960
particular power not by protest US but by his our torrid task that is to say

873
01:10:21.670 --> 01:10:26.670
that by by the influence that his persona and his achievements and all those

874
01:10:27.161 --> 01:10:29.530
things had over his fellow citizens.

875
01:10:30.130 --> 01:10:32.410
Well in the case of Augustus it was a flat lie.

876
01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:37.450
Augustus had a monopoly of all the armed force there was in the Mediterranean.

877
01:10:37.930 --> 01:10:42.670
<v 2>He also had a vast treasury that he could use for his own purposes.</v>

878
01:10:43.090 --> 01:10:47.020
He was as all historians in the modern world make perfectly clear.

879
01:10:47.230 --> 01:10:52.230
He was an emperor who ruled it was no matter what instruments he used.

880
01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:54.610
It was a one man rule.

881
01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.830
Then the second you can see how it doesn't apply to Pericles Pericles had no

882
01:10:59.831 --> 01:11:01.420
armed forces available to him.

883
01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:07.560
He could not enforce anything by pulling out some soldiers to do anything that

884
01:11:08.411 --> 01:11:11.200
he wanted to do.
Anything.

885
01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:16.290
Any use of any armed forces always had to be voted by the Assembly and debated

886
01:11:17.111 --> 01:11:20.730
and discussed and a majority determined whether it could be done

887
01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:25.590
moreover every month.
The question was raised as you know.

888
01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:32.000
Is parallelism like all the other generals okay or has he violated anything.

889
01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:33.630
Charges could be brought against him.

890
01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:38.130
He could be brought to chuck it to court and that's what happened to him in the

891
01:11:38.131 --> 01:11:43.131
middle of the war and 430 his enemies did bring him did bring charges against

892
01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:43.950
him.

893
01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:48.950
He was convicted he was removed temporarily from the general ship and he had to

894
01:11:49.501 --> 01:11:50.850
pay a very very heavy fine.

895
01:11:51.090 --> 01:11:56.090
This is not the business of dictators so very briefly their citizen is wrong

896
01:11:57.821 --> 01:12:01.030
about that.
Why did he want to say that.

897
01:12:01.570 --> 01:12:06.520
And this gets to my own explanation of how we can understand.

898
01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:11.020
I've made the the argument that he's wrong about the origins of war.

899
01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:15.700
Next time I'll make the case of the war next time I'll make the case that he was

900
01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:20.880
wrong in fully supporting strip Pericles strategy in the Peloponnesian War as

901
01:12:23.471 --> 01:12:27.310
the correct one.
I make the claim that the opposite is true.

902
01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:32.440
If I'm right why in the world did he say the things he did and I think we need

903
01:12:32.441 --> 01:12:37.441
to understand his situation and for 24 he was a general commanding Athenian

904
01:12:38.381 --> 01:12:42.640
force.
Naval forces in the north.
He was.

905
01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:47.170
Away from the place where they expected him to be.

906
01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:52.030
When there was this suddenly surprise seizure of the important Athenian city of

907
01:12:52.031 --> 01:12:55.660
in fifth palace.
A charge was brought against him.

908
01:12:55.690 --> 01:13:00.690
He was brought to trial and he was found guilty and sent into exile.

909
01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:06.430
He spent the last.
20 years of the war in exile.

910
01:13:07.570 --> 01:13:12.570
Probably I would guess among fellow exiles and fellow opponents of the Athenian

911
01:13:16.061 --> 01:13:21.010
democracy because he is very clearly a critic of the Athenian democracy.

912
01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:24.990
And there he had to speak all the time to people who said wait a minute their

913
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:29.110
city let me get this right.
You think Pericles was a terrific guy don't you.

914
01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:33.230
Yes I do.
He would have had to say to his end.
He said.

915
01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:35.920
And they said besides didn't you get elected general in 424.

916
01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:40.810
And wasn't that about the most radical year in the entire history of Athenian

917
01:13:40.811 --> 01:13:45.040
democracy.
Weren't you a great pal.
How could it be a blue blood like you.

918
01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:47.980
Who knows what nonsense democracy is.

919
01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:51.370
How could you possibly hold those positions.

920
01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:57.120
And my view his history is his answer to those questions you think that the war

921
01:13:58.141 --> 01:14:02.100
is about the McGarry and decree and that Pericles is responsible for it.

922
01:14:02.370 --> 01:14:03.510
You're completely wrong.

923
01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:08.870
The war was inevitable and became so as soon as the Athenian Empire came on

924
01:14:09.511 --> 01:14:13.860
board to challenge the Spartan hegemony.

925
01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:16.890
Your view is naive and ignorant.

926
01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:20.700
So please pay attention to my history when I get it fully written.

927
01:14:22.290 --> 01:14:25.020
You think that Pericles was a Democrat.

928
01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:30.860
You bloody fool he was a man who ruled over others.

929
01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:35.880
He did not take his orders from the assembly.
What's my.
Oh yeah.

930
01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:40.890
You think that we lost the war because we had a bad strategy.

931
01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:43.260
The truth is the strategy was right.

932
01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:48.800
<v 6>And if his successors had not abandoned that they would have held out and won</v>

933
01:14:49.831 --> 01:14:50.664
the war.

934
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.680
And so you'd see all of your main ideas about what's happened to us in the past

935
01:14:55.770 --> 01:14:56.603
are wrong.

936
01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:02.180
And that is why I did what I did and I was right to do so every step of the way.

937
01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:06.480
That was his history.

938
01:15:06.570 --> 01:15:09.960
In my view was not merely an account of the past.

939
01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:15.350
It was an apple low job pro veto sewer a defense of his own life and of the

940
01:15:16.351 --> 01:15:18.600
great decisions that were made in it.

941
01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:22.200
And of course what I've just said is highly controversial.

942
01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:26.010
Next time we'll talk about the strategy in the war.
