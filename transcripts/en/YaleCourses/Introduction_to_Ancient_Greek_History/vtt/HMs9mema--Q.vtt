WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.970
We were discussing the,
in the broadest sense,

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.660
the development,
the emergence and the development of the Polis.

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.570
And uh,

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.610
specifically I had been telling you about Hanson's theory about the development

5
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:23.631
of the family farm and the individual who worked the family farm as a,

6
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.660
a critical element in that story.

7
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.100
Now that same individual who produced the economic wherewithal that would

8
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:41.010
support a independent individuals who are not nobleman,

9
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.910
who could conduct their lives,
you know,

10
00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:47.911
autonomous way and who fought ultimately fought their way onto a governmental

11
00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:50.784
bodies,

12
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.140
which allowed them to participate in the key decisions to political decisions

13
00:00:55.141 --> 00:01:00.141
and all other decisions in the state that serve element of their character,

14
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:03.810
of their place in the world is the one I want to turn to today.

15
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.380
Their role as soldiers fighting for the common cause and that common cause.

16
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:15.990
Now being not an individual goal,

17
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:17.490
not a family goal,

18
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.270
but the goal of the entire civic community which was coming into being and I

19
00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:28.611
suppose would have had to come into being in order to have this role,

20
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.070
fighting for ones Polis,

21
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.600
the style of warfare that emerges in this period.

22
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.900
Apparently for the first time is what we call the hoplite Phalanx.

23
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.150
And each half of that,
uh,
needs to be explained.

24
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.570
Hoplite comes from the Greek word hope,
pleat,

25
00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:57.300
tastes and help lead.

26
00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.970
[inaudible] is built around the word helped long,

27
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.330
which is the name of a kind of a shield that the entrant treatment.

28
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.660
And we are talking about an infantry formation here at the infantry men wore,

29
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.791
oh,
Carrie,

30
00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:16.791
I should say it was you want to get out of your head the notion of a shield.

31
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:20.970
That's a little thing that you can move around with one hand like that real
easy.

32
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.230
That's not what it was.

33
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.640
It was a great round shield,

34
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.780
about three feet across.

35
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.960
Um,
and it,
it would wreck.
It had a kind of a,

36
00:02:35.961 --> 00:02:39.600
let me step out here so that I can show you.
I'll be doing a lot of it.

37
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.690
You can hear me,
can't you back there that all right.
Um,

38
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.310
imagine,
uh,

39
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.630
around shield of the size I've talked about and one of the things that's

40
00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:50.850
important,
this end of the shield,

41
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.530
the right and from my perspective has a grip on it.

42
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.230
But in the middle of the shield,

43
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.930
there's also a kind of a loose piece of leather Thong that you can put your arm

44
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:09.451
through so that the shield is resting in part on that script and on the grip

45
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:11.800
that you hold at this end.

46
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.870
You need to do that to be able to control a shield that's as big as that and as

47
00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:20.080
heavy as that because it is,

48
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:24.460
may fundamentally have a heavy wood typically covered by leather,

49
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.070
sometimes with some bronze,

50
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:29.890
the bronze sheet across the front of it as well.

51
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.090
That it is a very heavy thing and it's very,

52
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.220
it will weigh you down after a while.

53
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.220
It's going to be really hard for you to maintain that grip on that thing all

54
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:45.070
through the course of a whole battle.
But that shield is the key.

55
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.150
This [inaudible],
which gives the name to the uh,

56
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.390
word hoplite hopefully taste which is hoplite phalanx means that these men,

57
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.280
each man carrying his hot blonde are lined up first of all in a line.

58
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.340
But that line is reproduced going back so that you end up with,

59
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.080
uh,
about,
well,

60
00:04:10.081 --> 00:04:14.740
typically a typical Phalanx would have been eight men deep,

61
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.700
eight rows deep,
and that block of soldiers,

62
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:23.440
however long it is or is made up is called the Phalanx,

63
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:25.300
which is something like,

64
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.260
it means something originally something like a roller as because the,

65
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.000
the Phalanx would've looked if you were up on a hill somewhere watching it go by

66
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.240
as though something was rolling across the plane as the men went forward and

67
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.930
looking pretty formidable as that anything in its way would be mowed down in the

68
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:47.710
normal course of events.

69
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.820
So that's what we mean by the hoplite Phalanx,

70
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:56.821
a core of heavily armed infantry men in a solid block.

71
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.490
Okay.
When did this come into effect?
Remains you,

72
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.920
I'm going to start out today's talk by giving you what is,

73
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:10.921
has been the standard orthodox interpretation of how the hoplite Phalanx worked,

74
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.040
uh,
of which I think,
again,

75
00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:19.210
Hanson is a given us the clearest and most useful account.

76
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.570
But as you know,
already from what you've read,

77
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.260
this has come into great dispute in recent years.

78
00:05:26.261 --> 00:05:30.340
And I'll just say a little bit about the dispute before we get through today,

79
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.720
but what I'm giving you as the old fashioned traditional interpretation by that

80
00:05:34.721 --> 00:05:35.554
view,

81
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.680
the Phalanx would have come into being somewhere between about 706 50 BC,

82
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.610
which is to say after the earliest police are in business,
uh,

83
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.500
and according to this interpretation,
you really have them growing up together.

84
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.880
Nobody could be exactly sure about how this process work.

85
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.010
One of the big arguments that is part of this story is did this development of

86
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:09.461
new way of fighting come about rather quickly over a matter of a few years or

87
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.000
did it stretch out over quite a long time?

88
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.680
The most extreme critics of the traditional point of view would say over

89
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.760
centuries that you don't get the full blown hoplite Phalanx that I will be

90
00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:27.560
describing to you even into the,
until you get to the fifth century BC.

91
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.280
But as again,
let's,
let's take it in the traditional way.

92
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.830
So if you imagine this is growing up as the Polis comes into being,

93
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.430
let me describe what a hoplite was like and then try to describe what the

94
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:48.260
Phalanx was like and how they operated and what are some of the consequences of

95
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:50.090
their coming into being.

96
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.590
The hoplite himself is marked by,

97
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.390
first of all the shield and second of all if we,

98
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.880
as we continue to think about his defensive capacities,

99
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.490
he has a certain amount of armor to protect his body.

100
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.130
He has on top of his head a helmet made of bronze,

101
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.690
perhaps weighing about five pounds.
These are approximate.

102
00:07:17.691 --> 00:07:22.250
They would have different from person to person to some degree a very important

103
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.940
element that he would have had a breast plate made of bronze,

104
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.940
perhaps as much as 40 pounds worth,

105
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.800
he would have snapped across his shins,
greaves,

106
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.310
sort of like the Shin Guards,

107
00:07:36.311 --> 00:07:40.490
said a catcher in baseball wears also made of bronze.

108
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.160
The Shield itself,
as I told you,

109
00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:48.161
it was made of a heavy wood covered by a leather or bronze sheet about three

110
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:54.190
feet across something in the neighborhood of 16 to 20 pounds worth of shield.

111
00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.790
And gripped as I told you before.

112
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:03.470
So you want to think about this hoplite as a,

113
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.130
when he has everything on and when the shield is in place.
Again,

114
00:08:07.131 --> 00:08:10.460
let me sort of try to demonstrate this.
He is,

115
00:08:10.461 --> 00:08:15.461
he ought to be covered by some kind of defense from head to toe.

116
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:21.630
The top is this a helmet that comes up over his face and covers it pretty

117
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:27.530
totally.
It's um,
made of strong metal.

118
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.170
It's a,

119
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:33.890
it's got very thin slits to be able to see straight ahead,

120
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:37.760
cover it up.
Everything else is covered up a good one.

121
00:08:37.761 --> 00:08:40.250
We'll cover some of your neck as well.

122
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.760
It's very hard to see very much and you can't see anywhere pretty much,

123
00:08:46.431 --> 00:08:50.660
but straight ahead.
You shouldn't be able to hear very much either.

124
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.680
And um,
what else?
Uh,
I don't,
must have been,

125
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:58.440
must have been two delightful to breathe out of.
The thing,

126
00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:02.430
although you're in your nose is free,
but it's covered by a nose piece.

127
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:07.230
So there's this guy with this helmet.
It must way I'm driving.

128
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.920
I always want to have the modern football helmets,
which are monstrous.

129
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:15.840
I'm so old.
We used to play with leather ones without a face mask.
Uh,

130
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.330
what do they weigh?
Guinea football players here.

131
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.510
I think they weigh a lot.

132
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.430
I mean I think they're very heavy in deed,

133
00:09:26.431 --> 00:09:28.230
but I don't know how much they would anyway,

134
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:32.760
if you imagine sort of putting on a modern football helmet with that mask in

135
00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:35.430
front of you,
you would begin to get an idea,

136
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:40.290
only begin to get an idea of what it was like to have that a bronze helmet on

137
00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:42.180
your head.
So there,
there you are with that.

138
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.010
Then you remember you got shin guards down to your feet.

139
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:52.850
You have this breast plate now between your waist and your Shin Guard.

140
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.480
There's some very delicate territory and there's no

141
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.820
armor.
That's what your shield is for.

142
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.030
Your shield should cover that territory.

143
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:11.450
You want that shield up so that it pretty well meets your helmet.

144
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.580
So,
so it's going to be at a certain distance,
uh,

145
00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:17.820
but it will also go down to where it needs to go down here.

146
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:23.340
If everything goes right,
your enemy won't be able to penetrate you.

147
00:10:23.341 --> 00:10:28.341
But you should be aware that there are two places where you are relatively

148
00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:33.381
vulnerable for openers and that is if somebody can come in above your shield,

149
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.970
your throat is going to be available to him.

150
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.460
And if somebody can come in under your shield,

151
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.850
then you're vulnerable area will be vulnerable indeed.

152
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:50.690
So those are places where you see people get wounded and killed.

153
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:52.410
If that can be done.

154
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.030
One of the very important thing to understand this defensive problem,

155
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.930
and this is one of the debatable issues,
uh,

156
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.370
between the old guard in the traditional interpretation,

157
00:11:05.371 --> 00:11:06.930
I'm still giving you the traditional view.

158
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:12.060
If you imagine that your hoplite is standing with his left foot slightly

159
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:16.470
extended in front of his right and we'll see in a moment to pretty well has to

160
00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:20.130
be in order to deal with the spear that he's grasping.

161
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.760
And if he's holding his shield as he must this far,

162
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:29.360
then he's got a half a shield sticking out in this direction so that he's pretty

163
00:11:30.031 --> 00:11:31.950
well protected on the left side,

164
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:35.280
but he's got nothing protecting his right side.

165
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.550
If somebody can come at him from this side,

166
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.520
he is very vulnerable from there.

167
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:46.410
Now that's a very important point because why in the world would you give a

168
00:11:46.411 --> 00:11:50.970
shield of the kind I am describing for a man to defend themselves?

169
00:11:50.971 --> 00:11:55.600
If you imagine him standing by himself anywhere,

170
00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:00.700
if you imagine him any distance from the rest of the guys fighting alongside of

171
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:02.020
him it.

172
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:06.700
This has been one of the major reasons for explaining the function of the

173
00:12:06.701 --> 00:12:08.680
Phalanx is I will explain it to you.

174
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.760
What are you going to do about the vulnerability on this side?
Well,

175
00:12:12.761 --> 00:12:17.761
the answer is it in the traditional view is not as that he was never meant to

176
00:12:18.161 --> 00:12:19.300
stand by himself.

177
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:24.870
A hoplite only makes sense in a phalanx and a Phalanx.

178
00:12:25.391 --> 00:12:30.391
Understood in this way only makes sense if you imagine very close order.

179
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.460
Basically.
Ideally,

180
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:39.330
the right side of my shield is being met by the left side of the shield of the

181
00:12:39.791 --> 00:12:44.791
guy to my right so that we make a solid block of soldiers able to defend

182
00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:53.350
ourselves and perfectly,
but really essentially quite well.

183
00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.510
Obviously some of us are going to get killed,

184
00:12:55.511 --> 00:12:58.090
some of us are going to go down and we'll cope with that and just a few minutes.

185
00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:03.400
But if you think of us as a unit,
we have a way of maintaining our security,

186
00:13:03.401 --> 00:13:04.234
our safety,

187
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:09.240
so long as we remain in the proper formation that I have been describing.

188
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.040
Let me talk about the offensive aspect of it.

189
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:19.600
The idea of going into battle is not merely to avoid being killed.

190
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.920
The purpose is to kill the other fellow.
How do you do it?

191
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:29.700
The hoplite has two weapons of which the most important by far is a,

192
00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:34.090
um,
a pike I guess is what we would call it.

193
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:36.430
It's a spear that you don't throw.

194
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.030
It's a spear that you thrust and it has,
um,

195
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.800
it's got a bronze point,

196
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.670
which is the business end of the weapon.

197
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:54.100
It's length might be anywhere from six to eight feet in length.

198
00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:58.060
I should,
I said a bronze,
but actually it was,

199
00:13:58.061 --> 00:14:02.590
the tip was usually iron,
but it could be bronze as well.

200
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.300
In addition,

201
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.470
it had a but made also of bronze,

202
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:12.070
which could be a lethal weapon.

203
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:17.550
If I strike you in a vulnerable place with a stick that has a bronze but on it,

204
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.360
it could well kill you.

205
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:25.110
It would happen because the spirit itself was made of wood.

206
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:31.390
And that meant you can count on it often breaking in the midst of battle,

207
00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:34.270
in which case if you have one end of it or the other,

208
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:38.950
you can still have a point that you can use to help yourself in the scrum that

209
00:14:38.951 --> 00:14:43.720
is a hoplite phalanx that'll,
um,

210
00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:44.763
and uh,

211
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:49.600
although I don't quite understand that I should say there's many things about

212
00:14:49.601 --> 00:14:50.680
how the fighting went on,

213
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.980
which we can only attempt to imagine because we just don't have a films of

214
00:14:57.111 --> 00:14:59.270
ancient hoplite battles.

215
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:03.780
I'm sorry to say we have people inventing them,
but,
uh,

216
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.220
even the ones that are invented aren't very helpful cause this is awfully hard

217
00:15:07.221 --> 00:15:08.690
to know how they did what they did.

218
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:12.950
But I think we can imagine some part of it eat more easily than the other.

219
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.270
What I was going to say is that you could at least theoretically strike with

220
00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:19.700
your spear in an overhand manner,

221
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:23.270
or you could strike with it in an underhand man.
And the only thing is,

222
00:15:23.271 --> 00:15:26.450
I don't know how you'd do that under hand when you're in the middle of a
Phalanx,

223
00:15:26.451 --> 00:15:30.170
but,
so I will be talking about the overhand stroke,

224
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.810
which I find that easier to grasp.

225
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.530
Um,
so

226
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.600
let's see if I can again,
give you some sense of what this is like.

227
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.730
You have a,
um,

228
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:49.670
here's a hoplite standing like this,

229
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:55.630
and when he comes into contact with the opposing army,

230
00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.680
he will presumably striked down in this way.

231
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:04.850
There were other things that he can do.
His Shield,

232
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.440
in addition to being a defensive,
uh,

233
00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:11.210
thing is also potentially an offensive weapon.

234
00:16:11.211 --> 00:16:16.070
He can build you with that,
um,
uh,
a shield.

235
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:20.180
And if he's stronger than you are a better prepared or more balanced than you

236
00:16:20.181 --> 00:16:22.760
are,
he could knock your shield out of your hand.

237
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.530
He could knock you back and open up a space.
He could knock you down.

238
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:33.100
And so you should imagine that there's at least one chance to give you a guy was

239
00:16:33.681 --> 00:16:34.760
shot with the shield.

240
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:39.230
And after that you could just be using it as a something to press the other

241
00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:42.380
fellow back.
And you would,
uh,

242
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.810
meanwhile be whacking away with this in the most simple picture that you can

243
00:16:47.811 --> 00:16:49.880
have of how the hoplite would've conducted himself.

244
00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:54.770
The other weapon was a short sword that he kept at his side,

245
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:59.150
which presumably he would not use so long as he had a spear,

246
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:04.310
which was a better weapon.
But if that broke,
if that wasn't available to him,

247
00:17:04.311 --> 00:17:08.320
he could turn to a short sword,
which was a thrusting sort,

248
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:12.800
not like the Roman short sword,
which was double-edged and slashing.

249
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:16.180
You had a stick,
somebody with this,
uh,
uh,

250
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:18.560
hoplite Phalanx Sword.

251
00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:23.420
Now that gives you the picture of the individual.

252
00:17:23.421 --> 00:17:27.950
I hope you can get some sense of,
um,
what the Phalanx might be like.

253
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:32.300
But as I try to describe how the fighting really went,

254
00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:37.720
I always find it necessary to ask for some audience participation so that you

255
00:17:38.031 --> 00:17:41.930
can get some idea what it might have looked like in a very,
very limited way.

256
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.730
So I would like to ask for some volunteer hoplites.
The Greeks,

257
00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:52.110
uh,
as far as I know,
did not allow anybody to be left handed in a phalanx.

258
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:56.730
Think about the problem.
Uh,
so,
but we don't care.
You can be a lefty.

259
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:59.610
Uh,
you,
um,

260
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.850
of course the Greeks only allowed men to fight in the Phalanx,

261
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.980
but we are much more elevated than that.

262
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:10.250
So could I ask any of you who have the courage to come forward and fight in my

263
00:18:10.831 --> 00:18:14.430
Phalanx?
Nobody could just come,

264
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:16.163
come forward.

265
00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:18.853
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

266
00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.320
<v 0>I think we got more room here.</v>

267
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:25.543
<v 1>Okay.</v>

268
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:38.250
<v 0>One,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven,
eight.
That'll do.
All right.</v>

269
00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.710
Well,
good,
good,
fine.

270
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:47.400
Why do I have the shorter people come towards me and the tall,

271
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:51.990
taller people go into the,
in the back?
I think just making that easier for us.

272
00:18:51.991 --> 00:18:56.100
All right.
I like this line up next to each other.
I guess you'll do up here.

273
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.890
Come on up.
There you go.
Uh,
now,

274
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:03.960
right behind him and perfect order you guys,
biggest guys in the back.
Go ahead.

275
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.800
Good,
good.
I'm making this third row.
There's enough for a third row.

276
00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.900
Are we all set back up?
Make sure you behind somebody directly behind someone.

277
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:18.530
We need.
How many we got up front for
that.

278
00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.750
So we'll have a three in the back.
That'll be all right.

279
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.440
But you get right behind that guy.
You gotta be,
boy,
you've got to be lined up.

280
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:29.360
All right,
now get into your hoplites stance.

281
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:34.070
Left foot forward.
Okay.

282
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.120
Now when you're fighting,
if you're fortunate enough,

283
00:19:38.121 --> 00:19:42.710
and the Greeks were sometimes fortunate enough to fight people who were not

284
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:46.820
hoplites.
Like when the Persians came at them,

285
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:51.440
they fought off the hoplites against non hoplites.
Boy,

286
00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.330
that's a nice day for a hoplite.

287
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.130
The Persian infantry did not have heavy armor.

288
00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.570
They did not have that kind of a shield.
They had wicker shields.
We have,

289
00:20:02.571 --> 00:20:07.490
fortunately,
we have vase paintings that show us Persians for one thing.

290
00:20:07.491 --> 00:20:12.410
They're not dressed like civilized people in a dress.
They're wearing pants.

291
00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.430
But they're also,

292
00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:20.600
their shields are made of wicker and they don't have that kind of a metal body

293
00:20:20.601 --> 00:20:21.680
armor and all that stuff.

294
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:26.300
And so you could blow through that infantry like butter.

295
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:30.830
I'm probably never that easy,
but really you're just not going to lose.

296
00:20:30.831 --> 00:20:35.831
And the truth of the matter is hoplites beat non hoplites in all battles that

297
00:20:37.521 --> 00:20:41.410
are fought on flat land,
uh,
in uh,

298
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:47.090
that'll set the Greeks fighting.
Uh,
I was going to,
I just want to tell you about,

299
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.930
uh,
in Herat it,

300
00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:53.140
he tells the tale about how,

301
00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:56.560
how the fighting went versus the the Persians.
And here's the line.

302
00:20:56.561 --> 00:20:58.900
He says once the Greeks go to war,

303
00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:04.110
they choose the best and smoothest place to go down and have their battle on

304
00:21:05.141 --> 00:21:05.974
that.

305
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:11.020
And that wasn't just because they sort of had an aesthetic pleasure in Nice flat

306
00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:11.913
fields.

307
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:17.040
That's what you need for a failings because to maintain the integrity of the

308
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:19.300
hoplite line,

309
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:24.600
you can't have bumps and grooves and trees and rivers in the way it will break

310
00:21:24.731 --> 00:21:29.410
things up.
So they do in fact seek such a field.

311
00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:33.010
If you're,
if you're fighting a non hop light infantry crowd,

312
00:21:33.011 --> 00:21:33.844
you're in great shape.

313
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:39.360
But what the Greek spent most of their time doing was fighting each other one

314
00:21:39.491 --> 00:21:44.170
hoplite battle of Phalanx against another hoplite Phalanx.

315
00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:49.650
So you have to imagine that this thing started with these guys back in their

316
00:21:49.901 --> 00:21:54.901
camp and the other army back in it's camp and they both have to agree that they

317
00:21:56.201 --> 00:22:00.940
want to have a battle for a battle to take place and they will have picked a

318
00:22:00.941 --> 00:22:03.970
place that is flat where they can do what they're doing.

319
00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:08.950
Usually the battle took place over some land that was uh,

320
00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:13.840
being contested on a frontier and they would go down to that area and pick a

321
00:22:13.841 --> 00:22:17.080
spot and there they would go and fight with one another.

322
00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.740
So now the of the two armies aligned up.

323
00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:26.770
Here's an interesting question.
How wide is the line going to be?

324
00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.040
Well,
that's not an answer.

325
00:22:30.041 --> 00:22:33.470
That is entirely at the,
uh,

326
00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:38.560
disposal of the general because he's got two considerations that he has to worry

327
00:22:38.561 --> 00:22:39.394
about.

328
00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:44.640
One is he can't afford to have his hoplite line outflanked because if I can come

329
00:22:45.221 --> 00:22:49.180
around and take care of this guy from this side,

330
00:22:49.181 --> 00:22:52.810
he's engaged with a guy who's right opposite him,
I can just kill him.

331
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.920
No problem at all.

332
00:22:55.270 --> 00:23:00.270
So he has gone to at least try to be equal with the guy who is furthest on this

333
00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:07.480
side.
And same with the guy on the other side.
So that means he's got to open it.

334
00:23:07.481 --> 00:23:10.060
He's got to make his line unless he comes up with some clever trick,

335
00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.520
the same size as the guy,
as the other guy.

336
00:23:12.521 --> 00:23:17.521
Well what typically the two armies aren't identically in identical in size.

337
00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:22.420
So if you're going to try to be the same breadth across the field,

338
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:28.110
that's going to affect how deep you can be and depth as we shall see once we get

339
00:23:29.111 --> 00:23:34.111
started fighting as relevant in ways that we need to work out.

340
00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:39.550
But if at one Phalanx is 80 and the other Phalanx is 12 deep,

341
00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:45.160
the 12 deep Phalanx has an advantage.
And so numbers count,

342
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:49.160
but it's not an easy one to one question.

343
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:53.660
Various issues will determine who comes out of the head.
Okay,

344
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:54.523
now

345
00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:01.240
let's make this first battle I'm going to describe for you be as clear cut as we

346
00:24:02.301 --> 00:24:04.370
can make it.
And it probably never was like that.

347
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:09.610
Let's imagine my army is the same size is there is precisely so that the line is

348
00:24:10.641 --> 00:24:14.510
the same size on both sides and um,

349
00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:17.690
and it's all there for Wilson to the same depth.

350
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:21.650
And so we'll just do this imaginary perfect battle

351
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:27.590
he's going to have at as the two armies approach each other.

352
00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:32.680
I should make it clear they start out walking at a certain clip.

353
00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.340
By the way,
it's critical that they should stay in formation.

354
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:40.100
Nobody should get ahead of anybody else.
How do you do that?

355
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:45.190
With rhythm and the A in subsequent armies and later in history used drums to

356
00:24:46.101 --> 00:24:47.390
maintain that technique.

357
00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:52.780
The Greeks did it by the playing of a flute like or oboe like instrument that

358
00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:59.090
played a military tune that had you marching forward at the right pace.

359
00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:02.270
That was very,
very important.
So you're marching forward at that pace.

360
00:25:02.271 --> 00:25:04.670
But now as you get closer and closer to each other,

361
00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.990
various items begin to affect your behavior.

362
00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:13.490
One is I would think fear.
In fact,

363
00:25:13.491 --> 00:25:18.050
I know fear.
Uh,
so what do you can't?

364
00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:19.700
It's supposedly you feel like running.

365
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:24.170
Can you boys in the first row run anywhere?

366
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:27.980
You got seven guys behind it.
It's not even an option.

367
00:25:27.981 --> 00:25:31.370
And that's a very important aspect of the failing.
That's not even an issue.

368
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:33.710
So if you're afraid,
what are you afraid of?
Well,

369
00:25:33.711 --> 00:25:38.360
the other guy is got people I should have mentioned on the sidelines one way in

370
00:25:38.361 --> 00:25:40.730
another shooting arrows at you,

371
00:25:40.731 --> 00:25:44.900
throwing javelins at you,
things like that.

372
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:49.040
You want to get through that as fast as you can and engage with the enemy.

373
00:25:49.041 --> 00:25:53.480
But there's another reason why you want to get there fastest because well,

374
00:25:53.481 --> 00:25:57.680
by now you've gotten you,
I should've pointed out that a chant we,

375
00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:01.730
we know that before you started out the battle that you're general gave you a

376
00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:06.790
meal and he also gave you plenty of wine so that by the time you were in this

377
00:26:08.571 --> 00:26:13.270
position,
you've had a few.
And there's,

378
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:16.400
I mean there's,
it is a science to that too,
is perhaps some of you know,

379
00:26:16.401 --> 00:26:19.580
no you don't.
You know,
college students,
they have no science at all.

380
00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.790
They just said pour the stuff down their throats with a goal of becoming drunk

381
00:26:22.791 --> 00:26:27.650
as fast as they can.
That's barbaric in the technical sense.

382
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.980
I mean,
the Greeks didn't say Plato Symposium,

383
00:26:33.981 --> 00:26:37.040
all of these guys are sitting around having a drinking party.

384
00:26:37.041 --> 00:26:38.180
That's all they do all night.

385
00:26:38.181 --> 00:26:43.181
But they also are talking and they're talking very well as a matter of fact.

386
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.260
And they are,

387
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:50.470
the goal of this conversation is,
or,

388
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:54.930
or this party rather symposium means by the way,
drinking together.

389
00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.690
So they're drinking and they're talking.

390
00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.620
And both of these are supposed to go on at the same time.
And here's the thing.

391
00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:07.280
The idea is to drink as much as you can without passing out.

392
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.580
And at the end of Plato symposium,

393
00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:15.840
everybody is out except for Socrates,

394
00:27:15.841 --> 00:27:19.020
who looks around and says,
oh,
well no more conversation and everybody's asleep.

395
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.810
Off He goes.
And we know who won that one.

396
00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.350
Why could they do that?
Well,
they weren't,
you know,

397
00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:32.190
ignorant undergraduates,
but,
but beyond that,

398
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:36.780
they drank wine,
not those barbarian liquids that you drink.

399
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.560
And also they mixed that wine with water so that it shouldn't get them drunk too

400
00:27:43.021 --> 00:27:43.854
fast.

401
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:48.030
Think about how the world has decayed since those days.

402
00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:52.220
So anyway,
but the point is,
they've been put,
it still has its,
uh,

403
00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:55.020
it's a alcoholic consequences.

404
00:27:55.350 --> 00:28:00.350
And I like to think that the trick for these guys was to get to that level of

405
00:28:01.681 --> 00:28:06.681
inebriation before it affects your nerves and your physical ability to act,

406
00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:12.540
but it's worked on your brain to the point where you get to that,

407
00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:17.970
that sort of what I like to think of that bar room,
uh,

408
00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:22.470
militants whereby if a guy says,

409
00:28:22.471 --> 00:28:25.860
what your past the peanuts,
you say,
Oh yeah,

410
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:34.320
I think to think that's the ideal hoplite mode.

411
00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.370
So I think that's working on and they want to get at those.

412
00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:43.080
So bees on the other side and they want to kill him,
that's their mood.

413
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:48.300
Well,
all of that is working on both sides.
And so then when they come together,

414
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.130
they come together in a truck.

415
00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:54.210
You have to imagine they're moving along quicker than you would by walking so

416
00:28:54.211 --> 00:28:57.540
that they will go bang and we can see what happens.
However,

417
00:28:57.541 --> 00:29:01.410
there's one other variable that you want to be aware of and that is,

418
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:05.340
he knows he ought to be going straight ahead like that,

419
00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:10.920
but he also knows that his right flank is open.
Well,

420
00:29:10.921 --> 00:29:14.580
he would love to be fighting at the edge of the Grand Canyon.

421
00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.630
So it has no worry about his right flank.

422
00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:20.250
But he's out there in the middle of a field.

423
00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:24.870
Now he knows that first step or to be like this,
right?
But he's only human.

424
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:29.850
So the first step is like this.
And so as the guy on the other end,
on that side,

425
00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:33.630
so in fact,
as soon acidities tells us beautifully in book five,

426
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.900
when the two armies,
uh,
actually hit each other,

427
00:29:36.901 --> 00:29:40.860
they have already made a slight turn to the right.
Everybody moves to the right.

428
00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.600
These guys moved to the right.
Those guys moved to the right and they're,

429
00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.890
they're smacking each other.
Something like that angle.
Okay,

430
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.910
so much for that.
Now here we go.

431
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:57.700
I'm coming at this guy and what I want to do,
if I can,
I want to kill him.

432
00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.190
If I can't,

433
00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:05.550
I want to knock them back because what I really need to do is to get him out of

434
00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:09.550
the way.
Let me imagine.
I've been lucky enough to get you out of the way.

435
00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:11.680
You're fighting him.
You can't even look at me,

436
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:15.730
but I can do that.

437
00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:21.850
And no one by no means by no means,
but let's face it,
in order to kill you,

438
00:30:21.851 --> 00:30:25.300
I had to earn the privilege by knocking him back.
Now,

439
00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:29.380
let's imagine I've been very lucky and gotten you just get down on your knee,

440
00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:34.600
right?
Right.
Imagine that she's very badly wounded or dead,
but she's out of it.

441
00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:39.910
Now,
here's where the ball game can really be determined.
First of all,

442
00:30:39.911 --> 00:30:42.810
let's let's consider the man behind her.
Is that you?
Yes.

443
00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:47.830
Right now,
if you are standing there with your shoes,
by the way,

444
00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.380
first three rows of a chance of hitting each other,
if did so,

445
00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:54.190
he's banging away over somebody's head at the guy and the other side,
but

446
00:30:55.810 --> 00:31:00.040
you see this guy in front of you has just been knocked down.

447
00:31:00.041 --> 00:31:03.010
The blood is spurting out of her neck or site or whatever,

448
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:06.460
and and she's groaning down there on the thing.

449
00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.710
What is your instinct?

450
00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:15.010
What?
What's your instinct?
Tell me.

451
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:21.550
Get out of here.
They just killed this guy in front of me,
not coming after me.

452
00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:27.540
I was thinking of that wonderful scene and how many have ever saw the,
uh,

453
00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.170
the longest day,
that day.

454
00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.920
There's wonderful scene with his German officer comes down,

455
00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:36.700
he's in charge of the defensive,
uh,
arrangements there at Normandy.

456
00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:41.890
He's in a bunker and he's reporting back to headquarters and it's dark and you

457
00:31:41.891 --> 00:31:46.080
know,
and suddenly it's enough light and he sees the,
uh,

458
00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:51.010
suddenly on the,
on the horizon is 5,000 ships.

459
00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:55.570
The whole damn fleet is,
as he calls back and he says,
they're coming,

460
00:31:55.571 --> 00:32:00.250
they're coming says,
well,
why?
He says,
how many says thousands of them.
He says,

461
00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:03.990
in what direction?
He says,
oh,
for me to do that?

462
00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.380
That's the way it looks to him.
So what,

463
00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:16.090
that's what his tendency is,
but if he does that,
it's very bad news for his city.

464
00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.850
What he has been trained to do,

465
00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:24.780
what he knows he needs to do is to fight forward and somehow over step over her

466
00:32:28.181 --> 00:32:31.960
step on her,
do whatever it has to do to fill this hole.

467
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:37.000
He's got to come forward and take the danger and take the blows and close the

468
00:32:37.001 --> 00:32:38.830
line.
Because if not,

469
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:43.700
now I am in the situation where my guy next to me,

470
00:32:43.701 --> 00:32:44.810
he's beating you up,

471
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:50.380
but I can now get her and I can step in here and the guy behind me can do the

472
00:32:51.981 --> 00:32:52.700
same.

473
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:57.560
And so we can create a wedge in which we are doing the killing and they are

474
00:32:57.561 --> 00:32:58.400
doing the falling.

475
00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:03.890
And if enough of that happens after a while,

476
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:09.490
some sense of what's happening upfront quickly works its way to the back.

477
00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.720
And there can be a moment there.

478
00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:17.120
But there always is a moment in a hoplite battle with the guys in the back say,

479
00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:20.210
oh we have lost this battle.

480
00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:25.460
And so the guys in the back turn and run,

481
00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:30.700
which is the only thing you can possibly do once you feel are Phalanx is broken.

482
00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:34.520
We can't stand against them anymore.
And when you start running,

483
00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.310
the only thing the guys who were left up front can do is run.

484
00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:43.240
Now think of what it's like to run with this in your head.

485
00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:49.610
Can you make much speed that way?
No.
And speed is what you want.

486
00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:55.490
And so the big issue is this is what you must never do,

487
00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:58.490
but this is what you gotta do.
If you're Phalanx is broken,

488
00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.040
you got to drop your shield and run.

489
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:04.550
And then I'm on the winning side.

490
00:34:04.551 --> 00:34:08.330
But I want to do is kill as many of these guys as I can.
However,
you know,

491
00:34:08.331 --> 00:34:13.331
there's this great question of how far to the Greeks pursue in a hoplite battle

492
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.350
and facilities has an interesting passage in there in which he says something

493
00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:22.840
that the Spartans win the battle of Man Tinea and,
uh,

494
00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:27.030
two acidity says,
but they,
the Spartans did not pursue hot play.

495
00:34:27.031 --> 00:34:29.870
The Spartans never pursue their enemies very far.

496
00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:32.210
It's as though he's explaining,

497
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.700
giving an answer to a question that somebody that,

498
00:34:34.701 --> 00:34:37.550
why didn't the Spartans do better in that battle too?

499
00:34:37.551 --> 00:34:40.790
Which there could be many answers at the battle of [inaudible],

500
00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:46.480
but it seems to as a much easier answer how basically the Greeks couldn't pursue

501
00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:51.590
very hotly with infantry.
They don't want to throw their shields away.

502
00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.240
They want to keep their shields.

503
00:34:53.390 --> 00:34:56.690
So guys with shields are chasing guys without shields.

504
00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:00.290
They're not going to chase him very far.
Now,

505
00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:04.970
another issue that emerges in discussion of these kinds of battles is a

506
00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:07.970
casualties.
For a long,
long time,

507
00:35:07.971 --> 00:35:12.971
the general wisdom was there were not heavy casualties in hoplite battles,

508
00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:18.950
uh,
people calculating on what I was just talking about.
But then,

509
00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:23.480
uh,
an old Yalie took this course when he was very young.

510
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:26.300
Uh,
lady became an ancient Greek historian.

511
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:31.950
I took the wonderfully outlandish device of answering this question.

512
00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:37.780
He simply took all the battles in Greek history that we have a record of in

513
00:35:38.011 --> 00:35:41.400
which we know what the casualties were like and counted.

514
00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:46.800
And he concluded you anybody can check because there they are.

515
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:52.310
That casualties could run as high as 15% at a hoplite battle.

516
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:58.640
Those,
that's a high casualty rate and many,
uh,
uh,
uh,

517
00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:02.700
military unit will break if they have that many casualties.

518
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:03.900
And the,

519
00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:08.760
actually what he finds is the winning side would lose about 5%.

520
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:10.730
And the,
uh,

521
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:16.080
the losing side would lose maybe as much as 15%.
And so,

522
00:36:16.081 --> 00:36:17.700
um,
you get some idea,

523
00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:22.230
but don't imagine that these were anything like bloodless or easy.
They were,

524
00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:24.740
they were bloody.
Uh,
although the,

525
00:36:24.741 --> 00:36:29.700
the actual amount would vary with the circumstances.
Now,

526
00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:34.650
um,
you know,
the battle is over in a variety of ways.
One,

527
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.080
the enemy,
one guy ran away,
that's pretty good.

528
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:41.910
But for the Greeks it was very important that things should be really official.

529
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:46.590
There were,
and there's a lot of debate about what I'm going to say next.

530
00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:52.080
There were protocols of fighting that were followed.

531
00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:56.910
Some people want to have these be many and for them to be very binding.

532
00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:01.880
Others want them to be very few and not very binding.
And that's an,
uh,

533
00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:06.360
an argument one can get into,
but some things seem to be indisputable.

534
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:09.630
For instance,
if I say we won the battle,

535
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:13.680
I can prove that to you most of the time.
Why?

536
00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:18.060
Because I now occupy the land that we fought on.

537
00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:23.070
Therefore I can do what they did.
Take a stick,

538
00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:27.390
bang it into the ground,
hang on.
That stick a captured helmet.

539
00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.570
By the way,
please get it.
Thank you.
Um,

540
00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:35.730
I'll captured helmet or a captured Courselets something that represents the

541
00:37:35.731 --> 00:37:39.690
military equipment that the losers had.
The left on the field,

542
00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:42.480
we hang it up that is called a trophy.

543
00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:48.140
And the word trophy comes from the word that means to turn trefoil and it means

544
00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:50.183
to,
um,

545
00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:54.060
the reason that is this is the place you try to put it down to the place in the

546
00:37:54.061 --> 00:37:59.061
battlefield where the enemy turned and ran and that we own that property.

547
00:37:59.461 --> 00:38:03.450
Now we own their equipment and therefore we won the battle.

548
00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:09.170
Another tangible way of understanding who won the battle and who didn't is we

549
00:38:09.691 --> 00:38:14.100
winners because we own the field.
We can pick up the casualties,

550
00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:17.700
take care of those who can be saved.
Barry,

551
00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:21.630
the ones who have been killed,
we don't have to ask anybody's permission.

552
00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:24.750
Burial is very critical.

553
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:29.690
If you remember from reading the Iliad,
the Odyssey,
um,

554
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:35.150
it is absolutely critical in the Greek religion that people be properly buried

555
00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.050
<v 2>because if they're not,</v>

556
00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:42.280
they're shade goes on through forever in misery and pain.

557
00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:48.120
They cannot rest quietly and hades unless their body has been properly buried.

558
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.410
So you've got to do it.

559
00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:56.610
The losing side must come to the winning side and they must ask permission to

560
00:38:58.561 --> 00:39:00.180
pick up their dead and buried them.

561
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.720
Typically that is granted and they can then do it.

562
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:09.610
But what they of course humbling themselves by making the request and coming

563
00:39:09.611 --> 00:39:14.440
down under the orders of the winters and taking their dead away and being
buried.

564
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:18.340
So it's very,
very clear who won and who lost big.
And that's,

565
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:22.330
I think it's very important point because Greek hoplite warfare,

566
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:26.860
which is the characteristic warfare of the Greeks from the eighth century on

567
00:39:26.861 --> 00:39:30.220
into the fourth is,
um,

568
00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:36.120
never loses its character as a kind of a game in which there are winners and

569
00:39:37.421 --> 00:39:42.370
losers and the winners are given the prize and the losers don't get the prize.

570
00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:46.510
It's a contest just like everything else in weak society.

571
00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:52.050
And there's a tremendous amount of pride that goes into victory and a tremendous

572
00:39:53.051 --> 00:39:55.630
amount of shame that goes into defeat.

573
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:59.020
But we said the same thing about the Homeric heroes,
didn't we?

574
00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:03.430
And here's the difference.
They're not fighting for themselves.

575
00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.160
They're not fighting for their families.

576
00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:11.580
And only to a limited extent are they fighting for their personal glory there?

577
00:40:11.591 --> 00:40:16.591
Clay Os they are fighting for their city and they will be honored by their city

578
00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:24.610
in victory or even in if they perform very heroically.

579
00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:29.650
And of course,
what about if they were very shameful?

580
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:32.380
What about if they run away?

581
00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:39.210
I think I want to save the illustration of that one until we talk about Sparta

582
00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:42.070
with tortillas tells us very,

583
00:40:42.071 --> 00:40:46.510
very specifically how bad that is.
It's bad.

584
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:51.990
And so you have this tremendous continuity between the sort of the honor code

585
00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.400
that was so dominant in the Homeric world,

586
00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.850
which has now been shifted to the larger unit,

587
00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:02.650
which is the Polis.

588
00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:08.310
And if you can see all adult males fought who I should back up.

589
00:41:09.251 --> 00:41:13.060
That's not quite true to I is an important point I didn't make,

590
00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:17.200
not everybody gets to fight in the hoplite failings,

591
00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.420
the town,
the city,

592
00:41:19.421 --> 00:41:24.421
the Polis does not provide the fighters with their defensive armor.

593
00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.880
They might,
sometimes they might give them their weapons,

594
00:41:27.881 --> 00:41:30.910
but not to a defensive armor.
You can't find it as a hoplite.
In other words,

595
00:41:30.911 --> 00:41:33.770
unless you can afford to pay for your equipment

596
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:39.670
<v 0>and that x clues a goodly number of citizens who are too poor to fight in the</v>

597
00:41:41.001 --> 00:41:43.220
Phalanx,
this becomes a very,

598
00:41:43.221 --> 00:41:48.221
very large issue because the notion that there should be a real connection

599
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:54.130
between citizenship in the full sense and military performance is totally a

600
00:41:56.961 --> 00:42:00.200
Greek.
I mean the Greeks just totally accept that idea.

601
00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:05.630
Actually later on at the end of the fourth century when Aristotle was writing

602
00:42:05.631 --> 00:42:06.470
his politics,

603
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:11.570
he makes really a very clear connection as to the style of fighting and the kind

604
00:42:11.571 --> 00:42:15.680
of constitution that you have.
He said very clearly if you have,

605
00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:19.130
if you use cavalry as your major arm,

606
00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.380
your state will be an aristocracy.

607
00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.950
If you use hoplites,

608
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:29.300
your state will be what he calls a poly Taya,

609
00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:34.400
a moderate regime.
If you use a navy,

610
00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:39.880
your state will be a democracy in which the lower classes are dominant.

611
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:44.390
So that there's this real connection and that's the way they really thought

612
00:42:44.391 --> 00:42:45.224
about it.

613
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:50.150
And so what we will see as the Polis is invented moving away from arrows to

614
00:42:50.151 --> 00:42:53.270
cratic rule in the pre polis days or in the early polls days,

615
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:58.750
you will see a middling group of citizens who are according to this

616
00:42:59.091 --> 00:43:00.050
interpretation,

617
00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:04.760
Hanson's farmers who are also going to gain the political capacity to

618
00:43:04.761 --> 00:43:09.350
participate in the town councils,
uh,
and who are the hoplites.

619
00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:14.860
But it will exclude the poor who will not have political rights.

620
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:20.770
And most Greek states just as they never move beyond the hoplite style of

621
00:43:21.531 --> 00:43:25.490
fighting,
never go beyond the,
uh,

622
00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:28.070
oligarchical style of constitution,

623
00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:32.330
which gives only hoplites political rights in the state.

624
00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:37.580
Okay.
No stay there because who knows,
we might,
uh,

625
00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:41.540
the 20 million other things I might've said,
but instead,
let me put,
uh,

626
00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:45.290
give you the opportunity to ask questions that you would like to raise,

627
00:43:45.291 --> 00:43:48.110
particularly if you want to ask about how they fought.

628
00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:50.990
As long as we have a phalanx here,
we might as well use it if we need to.

629
00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:54.970
Are there any questions?
Yeah.

630
00:43:56.190 --> 00:44:00.890
What are they prominently farmers?
The answer is they damn near didn't.

631
00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:06.530
That is,
you've got a very key point.
There was very little military training.

632
00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:10.670
On the other hand,
you don't need very much think about it.

633
00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:15.460
What are the skills?
What are the technicalities?
If the bat,
if I'm,

634
00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:20.150
I'm the general,
right?
And so I say,
what do I say?

635
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:24.980
Chart.
Now we're engaging each other.

636
00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:28.070
What do I say?
Fight harder.
Men.

637
00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.550
Now we're in trouble and I don't run away.

638
00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.770
There are no techniques,
there are no maneuvers.
There are no,

639
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:38.910
you can't do anything.

640
00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:44.330
And so they didn't practice very much except one stretch,

641
00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:46.940
stunning exception.
The Spartans,

642
00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:52.700
they will not farmers as we shall see and therefore they spent their lives

643
00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.970
practicing warfare paid off.
They usually one.

644
00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:00.070
So the answer is,
uh,
basically that the,

645
00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:03.810
the ordinary Greeks did not engage in very much practice.
Yes ma'am.

646
00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:07.520
<v 3>If they're all fighting in this half split style,</v>

647
00:45:07.521 --> 00:45:12.521
how do all of these great Greek military personas developed who are famed for

648
00:45:13.161 --> 00:45:15.960
being such wonderful individual soldiers?

649
00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:19.640
There's no real hand to hand one on one.

650
00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:24.210
<v 0>Well look,
there is nobody out there that you could see typically by the,</v>

651
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:25.570
we don't have guys like that.

652
00:45:25.571 --> 00:45:30.571
The guys who are famous are the generals who are get credit for putting together

653
00:45:30.851 --> 00:45:34.740
a nice formation when it's not the simple one I've just given you.
I mean,

654
00:45:34.741 --> 00:45:37.380
just to be a little bit more,
uh,
um,

655
00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:40.480
playing about that famous battle of marathon.

656
00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:42.610
I will tell you about it when we get there,

657
00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:47.940
but one of its features is that because the Greeks were numerically badly

658
00:45:49.001 --> 00:45:53.170
inferior to the Persians,
they had this problem of covering the line,
you know,

659
00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:57.280
so instead they could have thinned out their entire Phalanx,

660
00:45:57.850 --> 00:46:00.940
but that would have given the Persians a chance to break through anywhere and

661
00:46:00.941 --> 00:46:03.280
everywhere.
And so what a,
uh,

662
00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:09.610
who's my general [inaudible],
uh,
uh,
did,

663
00:46:09.611 --> 00:46:13.600
was to make his wings heavier,
deeper,

664
00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:18.730
and very dangerously thin in the middle.
It was a gamble.

665
00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:24.240
The gamble was our wings will crush their wings and turn in on them from behind

666
00:46:26.951 --> 00:46:31.951
then from the side and set them a running before they break through our middle.

667
00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:38.080
And as a Wellington said at,
at Waterloo,

668
00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:42.640
it was a damn near thing.
The Persians broke through the middle,

669
00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.630
but just before that,

670
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:51.760
the Athenian wings crushed the Persian wings and set them running for their

671
00:46:51.761 --> 00:46:55.840
ships.
So everybody says what a genius [inaudible] was.

672
00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:58.410
Um,
similarly in,

673
00:46:58.411 --> 00:47:03.210
in naval battles a domestically is that,
um,
um,

674
00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:07.610
Salmas,
uh,
comes up with a clever,
endless,
clever devices.

675
00:47:07.611 --> 00:47:09.370
So you see what I'm driving at?
We know those guys.

676
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:15.030
You never really hear of Joe Blow who killed 34 guys in the Phalanx.

677
00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:17.830
Oh,
they must've been some guys like that,

678
00:47:17.831 --> 00:47:22.660
but you just don't hear about those felons.
Uh,
okay.
Any other questions?

679
00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:23.553
Yeah,

680
00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:28.060
when they had no spear

681
00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:31.570
<v 1>get it wrong.</v>

682
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:34.850
<v 0>Yeah,
they would use these bears must've broke like mad.</v>

683
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:39.220
And so the thing to do with,
unless you have something else to do with,
you know,

684
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:41.650
go for you for your

685
00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:43.553
<v 1>wow.</v>

686
00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:49.430
<v 0>Always.
Oh yes,
always.
And you never,</v>

687
00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:52.520
according to my understanding of this,
you never,

688
00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:55.220
never want to be without your shield.

689
00:47:55.590 --> 00:48:00.350
That means you never want to be away from your failings.
This is disputed.

690
00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:05.180
This is exactly,
these are the grounds on which this new school,

691
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:08.810
uh,
one of the ways in which they argue otherwise.

692
00:48:08.811 --> 00:48:12.020
I'll say a little bit about that.
When I get through with the Phalanx,

693
00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:15.700
I just want to,
yeah.
What about projectiles?
Now,

694
00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:18.860
these guys don't have any projectiles.
However,

695
00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.800
there are light arm troops made up of those.

696
00:48:21.801 --> 00:48:26.801
Too poor to be in the Phalanx who do use projectiles and the projectiles are

697
00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.080
arrows,
uh,
um,

698
00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:34.550
javelins or stones thrown by,
um,

699
00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:39.650
slings to trouble with them is none of them has any range.

700
00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:44.750
Think about that for a moment.
Oh,
these are not.
Get Out of your mind,
Henry.

701
00:48:44.751 --> 00:48:48.230
The fifth,
forget about lovage in court.

702
00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:49.970
Don't have,

703
00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:54.970
what are those men in Lincoln Green with their enormous long bows made out of

704
00:48:55.551 --> 00:48:57.830
good English composite,
whatever,

705
00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:03.520
who can fire the thing thousands of yards and penetrate and killed the f the the

706
00:49:05.061 --> 00:49:08.960
French nobility.
How many have you seen,
uh,
Henry?

707
00:49:08.961 --> 00:49:12.890
The fifth in the Lawrence Olivier version?
1945.

708
00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:17.480
They've got this miserable modern one with the sort of Vietnam like conditions

709
00:49:17.481 --> 00:49:21.620
that they have out there training all through the goddamn battle of Agincourt.

710
00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:26.960
Great battle.
It's got to have sunshine,
blue skies.
Terrific.
Well nevermind.

711
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:32.600
Uh,
they had very poor,
they had very poor bows and arrows.

712
00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:35.420
He didn't have the composite bow.
It didn't have much power.

713
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:38.600
Then would have had a hard time getting through the shields and it didn't have

714
00:49:38.601 --> 00:49:43.520
any distance.
So,
but they were worth something because they did this.

715
00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:46.400
Actually those guys would be useful.

716
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:51.430
Not so much hardly at all during the scrum of the Phalanxes but should one side

717
00:49:52.491 --> 00:49:57.330
be retreating?
That's where they do car.
There'd be,
once you throw your shield,

718
00:49:57.350 --> 00:50:00.530
when you're running,
any,
anybody who's got a weapon can take you out.

719
00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.290
And that's when it would have happened.
Yeah.

720
00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:05.170
<v 1>Is it unlikely that someone like this fellow's name</v>

721
00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:12.830
<v 0>no Chinese?
Uh,
no.
The archer.
Oh,
in the Elliot.</v>

722
00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:13.763
Well,
is it

723
00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:17.400
<v 1>people would actually been able to do anything like that?</v>

724
00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:18.181
<v 0>Yes.
The question,</v>

725
00:50:18.181 --> 00:50:23.181
the Elliott shows has a various people who are very good archers who could kill

726
00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:26.100
the other guy.
I would say it's,

727
00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:28.460
I'm sure there they were bows and arrows

728
00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:29.330
<v 2>at that time,</v>

729
00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:35.090
but they did not yet have the kind of armor that they would have in this time.

730
00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:38.450
So they would have been more vulnerable and you wouldn't have had to have such a

731
00:50:38.451 --> 00:50:42.750
powerful ball.
Of course,
Paris,
uh,

732
00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:45.630
isn't he the one who kills Achilles?
Right.

733
00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:49.580
But Achilles of course you got them in the heel where he didn't have any armor.

734
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:52.190
Anything else?
Yeah,

735
00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:54.273
<v 1>yeah.</v>

736
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:05.750
<v 2>Ah,
very good.
Yes.
And that's a big argument that nobody has a good answer for.</v>

737
00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:10.970
It's a traditional answer is that these guys actually did press up against the

738
00:51:13.071 --> 00:51:18.071
rows in front of them and that this provided a momentum that gave the front line

739
00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:22.190
and advantage and beating the enemy,
facing them.

740
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.230
You can see all kinds of troubles.

741
00:51:24.231 --> 00:51:27.650
Why didn't the guys in the middle of get crushed?
Uh,
you know,

742
00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:32.390
I don't have any very good answers for that.
And yet it is.

743
00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:35.090
One part of the traditional explanation is this,

744
00:51:35.091 --> 00:51:39.500
and it's a very important one in much debated that at a critical time in the

745
00:51:39.501 --> 00:51:39.831
battle.

746
00:51:39.831 --> 00:51:44.831
One technique would be one side would give one great big shove,

747
00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:48.170
the word in Greek is off,
says moss.

748
00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:52.490
And if that was successful as it might be,

749
00:51:52.491 --> 00:51:57.410
could knock down the lines of the front guys and get the other side running.

750
00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:01.460
And there's an ancient evidence is an ancient source for that that says that's

751
00:52:01.461 --> 00:52:05.300
what happened.
And that's one of the things that we have to deal with.

752
00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:09.110
The critics of this point of view would say that's impossible and inconceivable.

753
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:14.800
Another possible explanation of the significance of depth is remember our poor

754
00:52:15.381 --> 00:52:19.740
victim here.
If you multiply her,
then,
um,

755
00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:24.880
you want to have as much depth to fill in behind to close that hole as you can

756
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:30.350
so that that would make your Phalanx more sturdy because you ha you could,

757
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:34.820
could take more casualties without breaking.
That seems reasonable to me.

758
00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.080
Uh,
but again,
I,

759
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:41.000
I can't imagine how these guys fought in these circumstances.

760
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:44.220
I really can't see it.
I mean,
I,

761
00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:49.360
it's a pity we can't kill people as in experiments deliberately anymore because

762
00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:54.410
we need to see how this works.
But I'm,
I can't do it.

763
00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:58.970
Um,
but I do think that that makes a reasonable amount of sense.

764
00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:02.180
Anything else on are the mechanics of our failings?
Yes.

765
00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:05.210
A little louder.
Please

766
00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:11.530
charge each other.
Is that what you're saying?

767
00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:18.520
Well,
what happens is it's usually,
well,
it's always the case.

768
00:53:18.521 --> 00:53:21.160
One army is invading the land of the other.

769
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:26.310
So it's in a way it decides when the fighting is to take place up to a point.

770
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.811
Namely,

771
00:53:27.811 --> 00:53:32.040
it's going to happen this summer cause we're coming and it's going to happen

772
00:53:32.041 --> 00:53:35.670
this week.
It's going to happen tomorrow if you don't run away.

773
00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:40.890
So now the defenders have to do in the perfect situation,

774
00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:46.070
I am marching towards their corn crop grain crop at the time,

775
00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:51.810
just before the grain is going to be harvested.
If we cut down that grain,

776
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:53.160
you don't eat this winter,

777
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:58.020
you get in front of the grain when we say so.

778
00:53:58.021 --> 00:54:02.100
That would be the classic way of determining how it works.
It's never,

779
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.990
it probably wasn't quite that easy,

780
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:07.680
but that not the invading side goes for something that the other fella has to

781
00:54:07.681 --> 00:54:11.700
defend.
And that determines when the fighting takes place.
Yes sir.

782
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:13.063
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

783
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:19.313
<v 2>Hard to say.</v>

784
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:25.100
Hard to imagine anybody doing this for more than a couple of hours.

785
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:30.330
So that would be my guess,
but nobody knows for sure.

786
00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:34.970
But I think if you can imagine up to a couple of hours would be about right.

787
00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:39.870
And that's worth mentioning.
How long has the war?
A couple of hours.

788
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:44.220
Because typically there's just one battle.
One side beats the other,

789
00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:47.730
and that's the war for now until we get,
of course,

790
00:54:47.731 --> 00:54:50.370
this is all early days until we get to the Peloponnesian war,

791
00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:54.660
when things change radically in fighting in general.
But this is your standard.

792
00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:55.523
Yes sir.

793
00:54:56.790 --> 00:54:57.623
<v 1>Yeah,
yeah,</v>

794
00:55:02.570 --> 00:55:03.820
yeah.
I could be that bad.

795
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:11.510
<v 2>Well,
you got to realize that much of the time until the,</v>

796
00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:16.400
until the Phalanx breaks,
there's not a lot of killing that can go on.

797
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:18.740
You can only kill just,
you know,

798
00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:22.190
just a few people while they're still defending themselves in this manner.

799
00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:24.860
I have to believe that the bulk,

800
00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:27.290
the bulk of the killing took place on the flight.

801
00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:30.710
And so that's why that works out.

802
00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:34.150
<v 1>Yup.
What do you do the rest of the time?
Just</v>

803
00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:39.170
<v 2>you,
you if you're not hitting your pushing,
that's the theory</v>

804
00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:44.600
or too or too,
yes.

805
00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:45.883
<v 1>How did they decide?</v>

806
00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:49.633
<v 2>No,
that's right.</v>

807
00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:53.970
They would have decided on the basis of what was most effective and you
wouldn't,

808
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:56.180
you would not want old guys.
By the way,

809
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:58.670
how old are the people out there is a good question.

810
00:56:00.050 --> 00:56:05.050
Typically the youngest guys were 20 typically the oldest guys are 45 but

811
00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:14.620
everybody was liable to military service in the states till they were about 60

812
00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:20.720
so you can imagine in certain circumstances there would be guys that old back

813
00:56:20.721 --> 00:56:24.820
there,
but fundamentally it's between 20 and 45 okay.

814
00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:29.650
I would have thought that the front row would exclude the older people.

815
00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:34.600
You want tough guys upfront.
You don't want your front line being broken,

816
00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:38.080
so the guys up front,
they're going to,
the younger you are,

817
00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:42.760
chances are you're going to be more physically strong than older guys.

818
00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:46.690
Probably though you wouldn't want to have the very youngest guys up front

819
00:56:46.691 --> 00:56:49.630
because another thing you want is experience.

820
00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:54.910
People who have seen this before,
done it before,
lived through it,

821
00:56:55.510 --> 00:57:00.040
and now you can count on him not to run away better than you can on a fresh

822
00:57:00.041 --> 00:57:04.210
recruiters.
Never done this before.
So if you,
I would have thought,
so you see,

823
00:57:04.211 --> 00:57:05.590
I'm speculating to a certain degree,

824
00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:11.010
but I would've thought you would've had guys 25 to 35 in the front couple of

825
00:57:12.341 --> 00:57:14.470
three lines and then behind them,

826
00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:18.490
younger men and then maybe the older men at the very back or maybe because she

827
00:57:18.491 --> 00:57:23.491
wanted to be sure that that last row didn't turn and run away too fast.

828
00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:27.760
You might have some who were not quite so old at the very back,

829
00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:31.060
but it's all a question of what's effective and why.

830
00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:32.680
That would be my thinking about that.
Yes.

831
00:57:36.350 --> 00:57:41.350
In what they normally I say that a typical Phalanx is eight.

832
00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:42.793
However,

833
00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:46.880
by the time you get down to the fourth century and people are doing all kinds of

834
00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:50.010
new and innovative things,
uh,

835
00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:55.180
we hear that the left wing of the B ocean army at Luke Tra was 50 men deep.

836
00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:01.120
Now,
what are you going to do with that?
But it's,

837
00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:02.360
it's clearly a fat.

838
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:07.430
There were previous examples of people trying to have a deep wing that would,

839
00:58:07.431 --> 00:58:12.350
uh,
would do things.
But if you take me back to my primitive Phalanx here,

840
00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:16.070
about 600,
six 50,
they're not doing that stuff yet.

841
00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:18.090
I would have guessed they were typically,
but,

842
00:58:18.091 --> 00:58:22.910
but I think the depth would have been determined by how many soldiers you had

843
00:58:22.911 --> 00:58:26.810
available.
You would have made your Phalanx as deep as you could.

844
00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:30.860
And uh,
once you had the width established.

845
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:34.210
<v 1>Yeah.
Yes ma'am.</v>

846
00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:48.200
<v 2>The question is what would the defeat an army,</v>

847
00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:53.330
army kill all the defeated guys who were still on the battlefield at the time?

848
00:58:54.110 --> 00:58:56.860
It would vary.
They could capture them.
There's an address,

849
00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:01.070
there's a reason to capture them.
You could demand ransom for them.

850
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:06.560
So there would be some inclination to capture men rather than to kill him.

851
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:07.783
On the other hand,

852
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:13.000
guys who are engaged in a fight of the kind way must imagine get very angry at

853
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:15.980
these guys killed a buddy next to you.

854
00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:21.140
So there would have been a certain amount of just furious killing going on,

855
00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:24.920
but I don't think that would have been the way you,
you plan the game,
you,

856
00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:29.060
you kill enough guys to achieve your goal and if you are still rational,

857
00:59:29.090 --> 00:59:30.770
you'd take them.
The rest prisoner,

858
00:59:30.930 --> 00:59:34.080
<v 1>I think would be the way to go.
Yes.
Yes sir.</v>

859
00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:36.893
Yeah.

860
00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:45.910
<v 2>What would stop?
It would be,
yeah,
why didn't they flanked each other?
Boy,</v>

861
00:59:45.911 --> 00:59:46.810
if they could,
they would.

862
00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:53.220
But the difficulty is if you take your left flank and move it out here so you

863
00:59:53.951 --> 00:59:57.730
can flank this guy,
one of two things has to happen to your army.

864
00:59:58.210 --> 01:00:03.160
Either you open a nice hole between yourself and the rest of your army,

865
01:00:03.161 --> 01:00:06.640
which case somebody who's going to get very badly killed and you're going to be

866
01:00:06.641 --> 01:00:10.570
on the run very soon,
or you have to somehow communicate to the rest of the army.

867
01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.520
Everybody come over this way,

868
01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:16.810
which will still leave that flank open to being flanked by the other side.

869
01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:21.820
That's what prevents that from happening.
We just don't see that going on.

870
01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:22.911
<v 1>Yeah.
What was it?</v>

871
01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:27.890
Just the big sense of honor and propriety that kept them from doing like more

872
01:00:27.891 --> 01:00:29.810
creative,
like sneak attack.

873
01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:35.710
<v 2>I,
I see it used to be thought that before,
but people were very careful.</v>

874
01:00:35.711 --> 01:00:39.760
We know that they do every terrible thing in the world,
in the Peloponnesian war,

875
01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:43.240
that whatever the rules were before they're off.

876
01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:47.980
When we get into the Peloponnesian war is just no dirty trick that anybody fails

877
01:00:47.981 --> 01:00:50.950
to do if we can.
But,
uh,

878
01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:56.050
they surely must have done it before to any,
you know,
when you're serious,

879
01:00:56.051 --> 01:00:58.360
any way to win,
we'll,
we'll do.

880
01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:01.900
But mostly you could make a virtue of necessity.

881
01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:05.650
The kind of battle I've been describing to get a nice flat field,

882
01:01:05.890 --> 01:01:07.090
two armies coming at each other.

883
01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:08.920
There's not much you can do in the way of trickery.

884
01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.920
And so you can take a high tone and say,

885
01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:16.480
anybody who fights any other way is a no good coward.
In fact,

886
01:01:16.481 --> 01:01:21.481
we have some claim in a Roman writer later on that there was a treaty back in

887
01:01:22.691 --> 01:01:27.310
the eighth century BC between a couple of states in Euboea that said they would

888
01:01:27.311 --> 01:01:31.340
never use,
uh,
you know,
uh,

889
01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:35.920
missiles of any kind because that was cowardly.

890
01:01:36.550 --> 01:01:41.410
The only legitimate fighting is man against man shield against shield,

891
01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:44.560
chest against chest.
Everybody else has a pussy.

892
01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:48.970
So I think,
uh,
uh,

893
01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:52.750
that became an IPI and whatever the reality was,

894
01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:58.030
that story was always being told.
That's the way for a man to fight.

895
01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:02.560
Anything other than that is open to the suspicion.

896
01:02:03.490 --> 01:02:07.420
Well,
okay.
Thank you very much.
Hoplites a little hand for our house,

897
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:08.343
<v 1>right.</v>

898
01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:15.813
<v 2>Um,</v>

899
01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:22.180
just a few more little details.
The,
um,

900
01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:29.160
this situation begins that remember the two sides are opposite each other in the

901
01:02:29.161 --> 01:02:30.600
field.
Probably in the morning.

902
01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:36.140
Each side conducts sacrifices in which they ask the gods for assistance in the

903
01:02:37.591 --> 01:02:39.120
battle.
Uh,

904
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:43.880
sometimes they hope that there'll be a favorable omen suggesting they're going

905
01:02:43.881 --> 01:02:45.720
to win.
They have breakfast,

906
01:02:45.721 --> 01:02:50.721
they drink and they advance typically to a battle song called a Pion,

907
01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:57.000
uh,
which we have,
uh,
what they said,
what they sang.

908
01:02:57.001 --> 01:03:01.870
I don't have the tune but I have the words and La,
la,
la,
la,
la,
la low.

909
01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:05.370
Does that sound like a good thing to march into?
That sounds good to me.

910
01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:09.660
I like that.
And then would come to battle.

911
01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:13.320
I talked to you about the pursuit,
the aftermath.

912
01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:17.540
Here's just one more thing you need to know about.
This Phalanx modified

913
01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:22.980
when the failings fought against

914
01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.700
any other infantry formation.

915
01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:33.140
The Phalanx wins until from the time we first hear of Greeks fighting non

916
01:03:36.811 --> 01:03:39.390
Greeks.
When the Greeks have the Phalanx,

917
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:44.210
I think I'm right in saying they never lose a batter.

918
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.580
Finally they do in the,

919
01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:53.570
I think it's the second century BC when King Philip of massive don has a his

920
01:03:55.021 --> 01:03:59.310
phalanx fighting against the Roman Legion and the Legion wins.

921
01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:03.420
But believe me,
it was no easy thing for the legion to win.

922
01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:07.980
Even in that battle.
There's nothing automatic about that.
But,

923
01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:10.470
and so,

924
01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:15.740
so great was the military success of the Phalanx that the king of Persia who was

925
01:04:17.491 --> 01:04:21.100
always getting into wars,
uh,

926
01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:24.660
and hiring troops whenever the kings could,

927
01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:28.950
they hired Greek hoplites to fight for them.

928
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.330
Uh,
when kings,
uh,
Prince Cyrus,
uh,

929
01:04:33.331 --> 01:04:37.650
seeks to overthrow his brother right after the Peloponnesian war,

930
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:42.680
he signs up 10,000 veterans of the Peloponnesian War from the Peloponnesus

931
01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:46.590
because with 10,000 Greek hoplites,

932
01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:51.740
he believes that he can conquer the Persian empire and make himself king even

933
01:04:52.111 --> 01:04:56.970
though the numbers are fabulous.
And those Greeks March,

934
01:04:56.970 --> 01:05:01.350
1500 miles into the center of the Persian empire,
down at the Babylonia fight,

935
01:05:01.590 --> 01:05:06.590
the army of the Persian king defeat the army of the Persian King.

936
01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.040
But unfortunately,

937
01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:12.420
the prince who led them down there is killed in the battle making the victory

938
01:05:12.421 --> 01:05:15.090
rather pointless because the whole idea was to make an king.

939
01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:18.940
And so then you have Xenophon riding his analysis,

940
01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:23.580
the march back to telling the story of how those 1500,
uh,

941
01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:27.130
uh,
those 10,000 Greeks rally got back home.

942
01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:29.723
Um,

943
01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:34.500
just a word for the other side of the argument.
I,

944
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:39.510
I went to read you a quotation from Hans von Vase,

945
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:45.750
who is the leading a critic of the traditional Orthodox explanation I just gave

946
01:05:46.091 --> 01:05:46.980
you.
Here's one.

947
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:52.270
It is clear that the emergence of the hoplite was only the beginning of a

948
01:05:52.271 --> 01:05:53.800
lengthy process,

949
01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:58.780
which certainly lasted more than a century and may have lasted more than two

950
01:05:58.781 --> 01:06:03.781
centuries leading to the creation of a close ordered hoplites only failings.

951
01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:11.340
The classical hoplite formation then was not the long lived military institution

952
01:06:12.491 --> 01:06:13.960
of scholarly tradition,

953
01:06:14.530 --> 01:06:19.530
but merely one phase in a history of almost four centuries of slow change

954
01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:25.480
towards ever denser and more cohesive,
heavy infantry for nations.

955
01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:29.140
And I'll read you one more of his,
uh,
statements.

956
01:06:30.130 --> 01:06:35.130
Those who favor an early date for the emergence of the hoplite Phalanx rely on

957
01:06:35.141 --> 01:06:39.510
the arguments of blogging meant above all one argument above all,

958
01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:44.170
the new type of shield adopted in the late eighth century,

959
01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:46.000
unlike its predecessors,

960
01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:51.210
could be used effectively only in an extremely close and rigid formation,

961
01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:53.320
double grip shields,

962
01:06:53.350 --> 01:06:58.350
thus presupposed or impose an extremely dense formation.

963
01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:04.380
The tacit assumption is that how has that hoplites stood frontally opposed to

964
01:07:05.471 --> 01:07:06.304
their enemies?

965
01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:11.520
Like restless rather than sideways on like fencers holding their shields

966
01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:14.830
parallel to their bodies.

967
01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:20.680
But artistic representations show that this is not how hoplites fought.

968
01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:23.380
I would say that the crux,

969
01:07:23.381 --> 01:07:27.010
the kernel of the critique with a lot of things you can argue about,

970
01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:29.680
the kernel of the critique lies in this assertion,

971
01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:35.070
which derives its force from an interpretation of pictures on pottery.

972
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:41.280
You can see I'm not too friendly to that interpretation,
but it,

973
01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:45.400
it is being taken very,
very seriously.
So seriously,

974
01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:50.850
you fortunate Yalies that they will be here on April 9th and 10th of 1908 an

975
01:07:54.611 --> 01:07:59.611
international conference on the subject of the hoplite Phalanx and the emergence

976
01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:02.560
of the city state.

977
01:08:03.310 --> 01:08:08.310
And it will be a classic Greek Akgonul confrontation because among the other

978
01:08:11.651 --> 01:08:16.130
stars who are going to be an engaged Curtis eastern,
we'll be one of them.

979
01:08:16.730 --> 01:08:17.563
Ah,

980
01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:23.020
the main event will be a one on one between Victor Davis Hanson and Hans Fund

981
01:08:25.670 --> 01:08:30.620
Vase.
You're all very welcome to come on that occasion.
See you next time.
