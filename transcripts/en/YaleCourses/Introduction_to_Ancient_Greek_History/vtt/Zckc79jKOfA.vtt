00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.513
Welcome back.

2
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.410
I want to let you realize that the Peloponnesian War is over.

3
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.140
What.
A RELIEF.

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.090
Twenty seven bitter years but it's just one of those times through history that

5
00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:23.470
you discover no sooner is it over than another kind of trouble starts.

6
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.830
And of course as you know the whole course has been filled with that kind of

7
00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:29.210
trouble and it will continue that way right to the end.

8
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.610
Well you remember what the Spartans allegedly went to war about back there in

9
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.433
431.

10
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.980
They were going to free the Greeks and the irony of that is really quite

11
00:00:44.621 --> 00:00:46.120
extraordinary remember a.

12
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.140
Xenophon ends his tale of the end of the Peloponnesian War How the Spartans and

13
00:00:53.141 --> 00:00:58.141
their people were all tearing down the walls of Athens to the music of flute

14
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.650
girls and everybody thinking or it seemed.

15
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.670
I forget exactly how he puts it that this represented the beginning of freedom

16
00:01:09.671 --> 00:01:10.360
for the Greeks.

17
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.620
Well of course he was writing this years later and he knew perfectly well that

18
00:01:14.621 --> 00:01:19.621
was an illusion because Spartan power which had grown to an unprecedented degree

19
00:01:22.631 --> 00:01:27.631
in the course of the war now presented the Spartans with problems and

20
00:01:29.261 --> 00:01:30.094
opportunity.

21
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.570
You know I think that's a it's a very important thing to understand and I think

22
00:01:34.571 --> 00:01:36.310
not enough people do.

23
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.940
Power has a certain life of its own the capacity to be able to do something

24
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.290
without somebody preventing you makes you think about what you might do in ways

25
00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:55.180
that you never thought about before when you didn't have the power to do it.

26
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.980
And of course this is what happens to the Spartans.

27
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.820
They find themselves presented with choices that they could take.

28
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.760
How would they conduct themselves and their state and how were they to try to

29
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.720
arrange the structure of states in the Greek world and including their relations

30
00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:21.244
to Persia.

31
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.110
Because they really had enough power to be able to think of different things

32
00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:28.930
they might do the logic of the situation

33
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.580
presented really three possibilities they could of course do what they had done

34
00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:42.200
much of the time before the fifth century namely to confine themselves to the

35
00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:46.760
Peloponnese is to maintain their control the Peloponnesian league and basically

36
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.330
not to get involved in anything outside the Peloponnesian much recommended that

37
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.910
in Spartan tradition it meant that the hell out problem which was always on

38
00:03:00.621 --> 00:03:02.450
their minds something they couldn't forget.

39
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.660
They were desperately outnumbered at all times by people who hated them and whom

40
00:03:08.931 --> 00:03:10.100
they lived off.

41
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.970
So the notion of leaving with an army from the Peloponnesian from the

42
00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:21.161
Peloponnese is at any time was always a questionable proposition even though

43
00:03:21.351 --> 00:03:22.790
sometimes it was necessary.

44
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.900
And as we shall see changes had taken place in Sparta in the course of the

45
00:03:28.911 --> 00:03:33.911
Peloponnesian War of which I suppose the most important was the appearance in

46
00:03:35.271 --> 00:03:40.271
the hands of the Spartans of a good deal of money which was made available by

47
00:03:42.441 --> 00:03:47.441
the Persians for wartime purposes but both in the doing in the collecting of

48
00:03:48.141 --> 00:03:52.520
that money and also in the taking of many cities away from the Athenians very

49
00:03:52.521 --> 00:03:56.640
prosperous cities the Spartans also gained a great deal of booty.

50
00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.350
So for the first time there were lots of Spartans who had lots of money and of

51
00:04:02.751 --> 00:04:07.040
course as you know not only was that not a characteristic feature of Spartan

52
00:04:07.041 --> 00:04:08.630
society normally was forbidden.

53
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.080
The laws in Sparta did not permit coins.

54
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.510
The closest thing to coins were these fistfuls of iron spits which don't get you

55
00:04:19.731 --> 00:04:22.980
very far and don't buy very much.
It was.

56
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.600
And see the point is that the presence of that kind of wealth and really no no

57
00:04:30.621 --> 00:04:35.621
traditional way of coping with it meant that there were other uncertainties.

58
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.690
Now that the opportunities that various Spartans fell so anyway.

59
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.000
The idea of staying in the Peloponnese is.

60
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.260
<v 1>Certainly appeal to many Spartans because they feared that involvement outside</v>

61
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.460
the Spartan world and certainly they fear the arrival of money which would be

62
00:04:58.771 --> 00:05:03.000
necessary as they became outside to live at least to be engaged outside that

63
00:05:03.001 --> 00:05:08.001
world would undermine those traditions which they valued so much which were part

64
00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:13.341
of their identity living according to the laws of life Kirkus war was what it

65
00:05:14.161 --> 00:05:18.570
meant to be a Spartan and made you feel superior to other people so there was a

66
00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:23.250
feeling of danger in the minds of the conservative Spartans who would have

67
00:05:23.251 --> 00:05:24.090
preferred that.

68
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.870
<v 0>But of course there was the other possibility that the Spartans could use this</v>

69
00:05:31.051 --> 00:05:32.240
newfound power.

70
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.160
<v 1>And I suppose the money that went with it to</v>

71
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.140
govern the things and maybe to exploit opportunities outside the Peloponnese and

72
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.600
that choice also could be divided up into two at the extreme.

73
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.600
The Spartans had it in their power to contest control of the entire Greek world

74
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.610
in the in the east.

75
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.460
I mean I'm leaving out as we always do Western Greeks who live in Italy in

76
00:06:05.461 --> 00:06:09.000
Sicily except when they get involved in the main theater in the Aegean.

77
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.610
But the Spartans could have and some Spartans did want to contest control of the

78
00:06:20.431 --> 00:06:24.900
Aegean and of the coast of Asia Minor and of the hill a spot in the waters

79
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.140
beyond with the Persians but would otherwise have controlled them now that the

80
00:06:30.301 --> 00:06:32.100
Athenians were out of the way.

81
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.680
This would require money but it would also make money available and of course it

82
00:06:37.681 --> 00:06:42.180
would take power but it would also produce more power in a certain sense

83
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.720
Spartans who took this point of view had it in mind to take the place of Athens

84
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.720
as the great imperial power in the Aegean.

85
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.840
And beyond that was a possibility and we know for sure that some Spartans in the

86
00:06:58.531 --> 00:07:03.531
chief figure here was like Sandor the great general admiral who had been

87
00:07:04.171 --> 00:07:05.760
responsible for winning the war.

88
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:11.030
We know for sure that he and others around him like that idea and sought to

89
00:07:11.701 --> 00:07:14.340
pursue it.
But they were not alone in that opinion.

90
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.750
And then there's a third possibility that the Spartans had.

91
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.920
And although we know the ancient sources don't tell us that any Spartan leader

92
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.280
specifically had this in mind the sheer logic of it suggests that some of them

93
00:07:28.471 --> 00:07:32.700
must have thought this was a bad idea and certainly some of the Spartan actions

94
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.790
suggests that they were pursuing such or tried to pursue such a policy that was.

95
00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:44.570
Not to be confined to the Peloponnese but also not to engage in this grand or

96
00:07:44.761 --> 00:07:49.761
you might even say grandiose plan of supplanting the Spartans of the Athenians

97
00:07:51.271 --> 00:07:56.271
which would include necessarily somewhere down the road conflict with the great

98
00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.260
Persian empire.

99
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.920
Of course the great Persian empire didn't seem so scary as it had at one time in

100
00:08:05.441 --> 00:08:05.920
the past.

101
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.190
Remember the Athenians had defeated the Persians first of all the Greeks had

102
00:08:09.191 --> 00:08:11.730
done that back and for 80 479.

103
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.470
But even so ever since then the Athenians had repeatedly defeated the Persians

104
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.370
over and over again.

105
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.300
So they weren't anything like the scary thing they had been at the beginning of

106
00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:26.860
the century.
But in any case you'd have to take that on.

107
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.940
And many a Spartan would have been deterred by that prospect.

108
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:36.330
And again by the prospect of having to have a fleet because there was no way to

109
00:08:37.841 --> 00:08:42.841
pursue this third policy without having a fleet that began to approach the power

110
00:08:43.001 --> 00:08:46.360
of the Athenian fleet when it had been strong.
Well what did that mean.

111
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.720
It meant using not the traditional Spartan military advantage hop like soldiers

112
00:08:53.291 --> 00:08:58.291
fighting infantry battles but also rowers and expert naval people.

113
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:08.430
I don't have the time to go into a detailed account of how naval warfare was

114
00:09:09.401 --> 00:09:11.420
carried on in the Greek world.

115
00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:16.650
But it's easy to forget that in addition to the rowers of whom there were one

116
00:09:17.481 --> 00:09:22.481
hundred and seventy in each tri RIM who made who were the engine in the sense

117
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:28.800
they made the thing move and officers and something and usually at least ten or

118
00:09:30.191 --> 00:09:35.191
so Marines who could be landed for behaving like hop lights on lamp in addition

119
00:09:35.501 --> 00:09:40.090
to them they were critically skilled people who made all the difference in the

120
00:09:40.091 --> 00:09:40.924
world.

121
00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:46.260
And whether you won or lost in these naval battles who were well Whoa they were

122
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.510
sort of like Chief Petty Officer is if you think about it.

123
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:54.750
Well master sergeants in the Army professionals who were very whose very great

124
00:09:55.841 --> 00:09:59.990
skills are critical for the functioning of the larger army.

125
00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:05.010
The Greek word for the most important of these was Cuban innate tastes which

126
00:10:05.561 --> 00:10:06.880
means steers men.

127
00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.210
<v 2>They were that and they were more than that by the way.</v>

128
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.180
It's a very nice word because our word.

129
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.430
<v 3>All the words that have to do with Governor government govern all derive</v>

130
00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.030
ultimately from the Cuba natives.

131
00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:22.923
<v 0>So</v>

132
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:28.960
this would have meant that all kinds of people who were not Sparta Yates would

133
00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:33.961
be critical for the success of such a commission of the overseas type and so

134
00:10:35.681 --> 00:10:40.540
many a Spartan felt that was too much of a derangement of Spartan life and

135
00:10:40.541 --> 00:10:45.010
didn't like it for that reason but you could still be in favor of a middle

136
00:10:45.011 --> 00:10:50.011
policy which would mean extending Spartan power or maintaining Spartan power on

137
00:10:51.491 --> 00:10:55.960
the Greek mainland outside the Peloponnese and there were certain things that

138
00:10:55.961 --> 00:10:57.070
recommended that

139
00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.240
for one thing the

140
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:08.370
Athens had been knocked out as a main power in central Greece.

141
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.550
<v 1>And that meant it had been demonstrated in the course of the war that it meant</v>

142
00:11:14.551 --> 00:11:15.340
it.

143
00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:20.340
That seems the dominant power and b o shop had already grown to considerable

144
00:11:21.551 --> 00:11:26.110
power had developed a degree of independence which allowed the three bands to

145
00:11:26.111 --> 00:11:29.600
challenge the Spartans frequently and to.

146
00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:36.210
And there was a very real chance that Thebes would become and would seek to

147
00:11:37.031 --> 00:11:41.470
become elite at least the power of the first rank at least somebody who could

148
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:46.960
sit equally at the table with the Spartans rather than subordinate to them and

149
00:11:46.961 --> 00:11:51.460
the fear that some Spartans surely had was that if the Spartans simply stayed in

150
00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:56.461
the Peloponnese as Thebes would become the master of Attica which was a neighbor

151
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:04.170
of Thebes as well as of central Greece as a whole and suddenly they would become

152
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.730
a real menace to the Spartans and indeed down the road if you go far enough.

153
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.870
That's exactly what did happen.
So that would be the case.

154
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:19.150
Well we need to be establish ourselves on mainland Greece as they hedgerow mons

155
00:12:19.151 --> 00:12:23.020
the Masters.
If not I shouldn't say mass ahead Romans means leaders.

156
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:28.530
There is always a conflict there too when you have a power which is superior to

157
00:12:30.311 --> 00:12:32.740
that of the other states.
But you don't conquer them.

158
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:38.140
The question is do you want to be relate to them as the Greeks would have said

159
00:12:38.141 --> 00:12:42.940
as a hedge and Mon meaning a leader which implies a degree of voluntary

160
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:44.940
cooperation.

161
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:50.370
Or do you want to dominate which means mastery and the Spartans disagreed among

162
00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:55.780
themselves as to what was necessary even if you were going to take that path.

163
00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:01.110
<v 4>But these three routes were theoretically and I think as matter of fact.</v>

164
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:06.320
Really things that the Spartans argued about and there was a certain amount of

165
00:13:06.811 --> 00:13:11.340
moving back and forth as the Spartans shifted from one to the other as different

166
00:13:11.341 --> 00:13:15.560
individuals gained influence and circumstances change.

167
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.220
It's easy to.

168
00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:24.220
To death to designate at least two of the factions and I'm I'm inclined to think

169
00:13:24.991 --> 00:13:29.991
there were three that can be identified and identified with people the most

170
00:13:30.211 --> 00:13:34.910
aggressive overseas let's conquer and control everything in the Aegean like

171
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.140
Sandor is clearly the leader of that faction

172
00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:42.000
let's stay in the Peloponnese sis and stay out of.

173
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:47.190
<v 1>Inter state rivalries and competitions and just go back to our old ways.</v>

174
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:52.640
<v 4>Appears to have been led by the king Pao seniors and there's another king ages</v>

175
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:59.290
and he is the one it's unclear it's not can't be confident that he represented a

176
00:13:59.291 --> 00:14:04.291
third faction but I think there's some possibility that he did and that that was

177
00:14:05.021 --> 00:14:10.021
the faction that wanted to limit Spartan power influence control to the mainland

178
00:14:11.561 --> 00:14:16.561
of Greece and not to go to sea and there were great arguments against the lie

179
00:14:16.831 --> 00:14:19.410
Sandor approach.

180
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:25.050
For one thing the number of Spartans was pretty small to control too vast a

181
00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:27.934
territory.

182
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:33.310
We can't be sure how many there were by now but it pretty it's pretty well

183
00:14:33.311 --> 00:14:37.900
agreed that in the middle of the Peloponnesian War there was something like

184
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.720
thirty five hundred Sparta eights.

185
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.440
Only that many and the figure continues to go down by the time we get to the

186
00:14:48.461 --> 00:14:52.070
decisive battle of Luke tra that defeats Sparta.

187
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:57.120
Finally in three seventy one there is perhaps about a thousand Sparta eights.

188
00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.080
Well how do you run an empire.

189
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:03.750
Forget about how you conquer one how do you run one with that kind of population

190
00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:09.150
and also of course the Spartans had traditionally not been a naval power and had

191
00:15:09.151 --> 00:15:13.260
done very poorly at sea compared to the Athenians at least.

192
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:17.700
<v 5>And it was open it was an open question how well they would do against the</v>

193
00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.180
forces that serve the Persian king at sea.

194
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:27.390
<v 4>The fact was too that they had no experience with</v>

195
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:34.200
money and money was a critical part of maintaining such an empire as the unions

196
00:15:34.811 --> 00:15:35.644
could tell them.

197
00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:42.030
And everything in the spartan tradition was based on land power.

198
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.390
Now we can overestimate that.

199
00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:47.890
After all the Spartans had been sending fleets out to sea throughout the

200
00:15:47.891 --> 00:15:52.420
Peloponnesian War in the last part of the war they won two important battles of

201
00:15:52.421 --> 00:15:56.170
which the final battle was critical.
The battle of egos pot of money.

202
00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:01.680
<v 1>But if you really look at the whole story it's not at all clear that the</v>

203
00:16:01.691 --> 00:16:06.691
Spartans ever developed the kind of system that would produce a navy that would

204
00:16:07.481 --> 00:16:12.481
year after year after year have the capacity to dominate the sea.

205
00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.970
So that was a practical limitation.

206
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:21.080
Well anyway however that might be the man of the hour.

207
00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:26.460
And for all 4 was like Sandor the great victor of the Peloponnesian War and it

208
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:34.110
was his policy was the extreme policy that lets conquer at all policy.

209
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.270
His policy was very much a personal policy and here.

210
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:49.200
The personal is very important the fact that like Sandow was who he was made a

211
00:16:49.301 --> 00:16:54.301
very great deal of difference by Sandor was not a pure legitimate Sparta 8.

212
00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:01.540
He was what the Spartans called a most Moxie was a technically a bastard.

213
00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:07.370
That means he had a Spartan father and non Spartan mother.

214
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.870
Typically such women were.
What but it had been Hellas but.

215
00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:17.860
<v 4>In any case he was brought up nonetheless as a spartan but not as his 48 and how</v>

216
00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:23.120
to put these pieces together is very hard to know.

217
00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.780
<v 5>But he did as a few others like him in the last years of the war rose to be a</v>

218
00:17:30.201 --> 00:17:35.000
general and the very best general of all and the man who was put in command of

219
00:17:35.001 --> 00:17:35.834
the forces.

220
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:41.740
But he was a man of extraordinary ambition and the ancient writers tell us that

221
00:17:41.961 --> 00:17:46.961
he had developed the notion of actually bringing about a revolution in Sparta

222
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:52.570
and changing the constitution in such a way that would allow him to become

223
00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:57.850
effectively the ruler of Sparta and the kings the traditional kings who were

224
00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.110
born to the purple to be put aside.

225
00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:08.030
Well if he was going to do anything like that even if he was only going to try

226
00:18:08.031 --> 00:18:13.031
to retain the position he had achieved of tremendous influence and power he

227
00:18:13.911 --> 00:18:18.800
would need to have a command.
He would need to have money.

228
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:23.750
He would need to have supporters of every kind and his policy therefore for

229
00:18:23.751 --> 00:18:28.751
Sparta was very much a policy that fit the needs of lies Sandor

230
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:35.650
wherever he liberated a city in Asia Minor which had been.

231
00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.230
Under the Athenian Empire part of the Athenian Empire.

232
00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.050
He established a different kind of government.

233
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:50.770
It consisted of ten men chosen from the local people who were friendly to him

234
00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:57.490
who were reliant on him his people his puppets if you will the the name for

235
00:18:58.701 --> 00:19:03.590
these establishments was deck car keys.
Rules of ten men of ten.

236
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:10.240
Groups of ten and they were his people and to make sure that they were safe.

237
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.050
He is stout.
He would.

238
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:18.070
He placed a Spartan Garrison or at least a Peloponnesian garrison in that city

239
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:23.800
led by a Spartan commander called a harm most it comes from the same word from

240
00:19:26.061 --> 00:19:27.470
which we get harmony.

241
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:32.680
Somebody who preserved order who was the the military commander of that region.

242
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
All of these people the harm most the deck clerks were all his creatures not

243
00:19:40.731 --> 00:19:45.590
anybody who had any independent power or influence simply his people who did the

244
00:19:45.591 --> 00:19:46.424
job for him.

245
00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:52.230
And liberators of the Greeks as they had claimed to be like Sanford did not

246
00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:58.650
abandon collecting the money from these cities that he had allegedly liberated

247
00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.180
at the same amount apparently that they had they had given the Athenians because

248
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.240
our sources tell us that the Spartans were collecting a thousand talons a year

249
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:15.900
from the newly discovered newly acquired empire which is something like what the

250
00:20:16.211 --> 00:20:18.610
Athenians got from it.
So.

251
00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:25.020
<v 4>All of that is in place this Spartan newly founded Spartan empire was different</v>

252
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.370
from the Athenian Empire in a variety of ways.

253
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:36.270
Remember that you've seen an empire it started out as a voluntary association

254
00:20:36.271 --> 00:20:41.271
with a very clear common purpose to liberate those Greeks who are still under

255
00:20:43.531 --> 00:20:48.531
Persian rule and to preserve their freedom from their Persian neighbors and

256
00:20:48.961 --> 00:20:53.961
former conquerors and on the other hand the this new empire underlies center had

257
00:20:55.201 --> 00:20:56.034
no purpose.

258
00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:01.020
And it was not voluntary in any shape manner or form.

259
00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.540
It was thoroughly compulsory.

260
00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:09.220
<v 1>I think it's fair to say that the Spartans had simply betrayed the Asiatic</v>

261
00:21:09.651 --> 00:21:14.651
Greeks whom they had engaged in the rebellion against the Athenians and

262
00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:23.910
kept instead of liberating them put them under Spartan rule and in many cases

263
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:31.080
frequently these governments established by the light center were tyrannical and

264
00:21:32.861 --> 00:21:37.861
rapacious in which these governors and the harmless and so on basically stole

265
00:21:39.191 --> 00:21:41.260
what they could from the natives.

266
00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:45.460
This is apart from the official payments they made to the Spartans.

267
00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:49.600
<v 0>They enriched these lice Sandrine creatures</v>

268
00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:56.560
as one of our rights so ancient sources rights to the will of any Spartan was

269
00:21:56.571 --> 00:21:59.950
regarded as law in the subjects cities.

270
00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:04.430
<v 1>It is clear from all the ancient writers that the Spartans were not</v>

271
00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:11.390
easy people in their dealings with other Greeks everything in their tradition

272
00:22:11.391 --> 00:22:16.391
made them feel superior to other Greeks and they didn't mind acting in that way.

273
00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:22.780
You remember the stories of how it was that the Athenian Empire was founded or

274
00:22:23.331 --> 00:22:28.130
rather the deal in league the Spartans had so alienated all the Greeks in that

275
00:22:28.131 --> 00:22:32.600
region by the way they treated them that they were glad to send the Spartans

276
00:22:32.601 --> 00:22:36.830
away and replace them by the Athenians who did not treat them that way.

277
00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:41.890
At least they didn't do it for some years before they develop into an empire.

278
00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.093
So

279
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.650
this was another problem Spartans were not good at this job.

280
00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:53.480
<v 2>But at the beginning what was decisive was like Sandy.</v>

281
00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:58.760
He was at the height of his power and influence and I guess it's fair to say he

282
00:22:58.761 --> 00:23:03.761
reached heights that no mortal ever had reached in the Greek world.

283
00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:10.540
<v 4>The oligarchs whom he had restored to power in Samos loved him so much and we're</v>

284
00:23:12.201 --> 00:23:17.201
so grateful for what he had done that they held religious ceremonies on the

285
00:23:19.311 --> 00:23:24.311
island and literally worshipped like Sandor as a god.

286
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:30.270
This is the first time in Greek history that anybody had received such

287
00:23:31.001 --> 00:23:35.830
treatment.
On the one hand this elevated his influence and power.

288
00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:37.690
Everybody wondered at him and so on.

289
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:43.450
On the other hand it presented a problem because you can imagine how that went

290
00:23:43.451 --> 00:23:46.600
down among the aristocrats of Sparta.

291
00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:51.840
And most particularly with the Kings of Sparta you see that this I use a

292
00:23:52.841 --> 00:23:56.890
technical term not a street curse word.
This bastard

293
00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.880
was now being worshipped as a god.

294
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:06.970
And of course that kind of eminence was unheard of for a non King in the spartan

295
00:24:09.161 --> 00:24:12.650
world.
So that had all kinds of trouble down the road.

296
00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.650
And he was as ambitious as he could be and it was as obvious as it could be.

297
00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:24.380
So there was jealousy and resentment and fear at Sparta that something bad was

298
00:24:25.771 --> 00:24:30.771
going to happen to the Spartan way of life to the Spartan constitution and pop

299
00:24:31.201 --> 00:24:36.201
seniors and his traditionalists biding their time for the opportunity to to put

300
00:24:37.681 --> 00:24:39.930
a spike into this development.

301
00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:45.360
There were other things that were flowing from what I've already described that

302
00:24:45.361 --> 00:24:49.740
were threatening the traditional character of Spartan life.

303
00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:55.320
This money of course allowed for corruption.

304
00:24:55.350 --> 00:25:00.350
Now people who had money could buy people's support could buy people's

305
00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:07.850
help in their own endeavors for influence and power in Sparta.

306
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:12.210
<v 0>One of the things we hear about that most scholars would like to place in this</v>

307
00:25:12.211 --> 00:25:17.200
period and it seems reasonable to me.
Was a new law about inheritance.

308
00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:21.990
It's the law of Epictetus.
He's the man who proposed it.

309
00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:27.410
<v 2>It used to be that inheritance automatically went to in a certain direction.</v>

310
00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.470
Nobody had any choice.

311
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.010
You couldn't make out a will and leave it to anybody you liked.

312
00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:38.550
It went through the family according to a certain pattern.

313
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:44.510
The law of appetite has changed that you now could write a will and select your

314
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:50.540
successors however you wished your inheritance.

315
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:52.783
<v 6>Excuse me.</v>

316
00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:57.840
<v 2>That meant that</v>

317
00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.860
there were ways you could work around that so as to bind somebody right.

318
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:08.300
While you were still alive if you wrote somebody into your will you were in

319
00:26:08.301 --> 00:26:11.360
effect giving him money after you died.

320
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:16.100
So meanwhile he could serve you and be your political supporter.

321
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.880
That was happening and people who had been raised the Spartans and expected to

322
00:26:23.141 --> 00:26:28.141
inherit their father's property would sometimes find that they had been cut out.

323
00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.920
And now they were Sparta eights by birth but they lacked the necessary wealth

324
00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:41.760
necessary land to provide for their meals at the common mess and so they could

325
00:26:41.891 --> 00:26:46.891
no longer be Sparta eights in the full sense and the term was discovered for

326
00:26:48.701 --> 00:26:48.880
them.

327
00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:53.880
They were called who put mayonnaise which means inferiors and some of the guys

328
00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:59.380
who rose to power late in the Peloponnesian War as generals because they were

329
00:26:59.381 --> 00:27:03.290
just good at it came from some such class.

330
00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.520
So you have a variety of Spartans who are important who are not harlots who are

331
00:27:10.751 --> 00:27:12.970
not people you can just do what you want to.

332
00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:17.110
They play a significant role in society but there they don't have the position

333
00:27:17.111 --> 00:27:17.944
of honor.

334
00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:22.980
The position of belonging that was necessary and these were disruptive and

335
00:27:22.991 --> 00:27:26.540
troubling developments in the spartan state.

336
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:32.770
There we get a clue about this and 398.

337
00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:37.890
We hear about the planning of a revolution in the city a man by the name of

338
00:27:41.321 --> 00:27:44.190
Kennedy on who was one of these ships of mayonnaise and

339
00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:50.920
was planning to have an uprising in which they would kill lots of Spartans and

340
00:27:52.581 --> 00:27:56.990
set up a new regime that would give room to the people who were outsiders.

341
00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:03.490
Well the plot was prevented because one of the people that Kennedy approached

342
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:09.780
told the story to Spartan magistrates and the plot was averted.

343
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:14.840
But he told the to the story he told was this he was standing one day in the

344
00:28:14.841 --> 00:28:19.841
Agora in Sparta and Kinison approached him and he said Look around you he said.

345
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.630
How many how many Sparta aides do you see.

346
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:28.870
Well the answer was forty he said and how many people are there around here who

347
00:28:29.211 --> 00:28:32.690
are not Sparta.
And he said about 4000.

348
00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:38.720
He was talking about hippo mayonnaise Nerio Damo days various other subspecies

349
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:44.210
but also how lots and also Perry oi oi.

350
00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:50.210
And said Canada on to the man he was trying to recruit these 4000 as regards the

351
00:28:53.581 --> 00:28:57.420
Spartans would gladly eat them raw

352
00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.880
so his message was is why don't we have a little revolution.

353
00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:06.920
Well yeah the answer was he was forestalled but it does tell you that the

354
00:29:07.971 --> 00:29:12.971
situation had become sufficiently dangerous that such a possibility existed.

355
00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:20.410
So there is Sparta coping with these various problems and trying to decide how

356
00:29:20.961 --> 00:29:22.580
to handle their future.

357
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000
<v 7>And I'd like to shift the scene now to Athens Athens which had been the greatest</v>

358
00:29:29.361 --> 00:29:34.361
empire that the Greeks had ever seen had been reduced now to total defeat

359
00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:41.860
absolutely at the mercy of the Spartans and indeed the Athenians feared and

360
00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:48.320
certainly had reason to fear that the same fate they had visited upon some

361
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:53.680
states that had defied them and there were two that fit the category I'm about

362
00:29:53.681 --> 00:29:58.681
to mention me lost the island that was conquered by the Athenians and efficient

363
00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:05.660
cities describes how the Athenians spoke to them in the famous million dialogue

364
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:09.070
and also a place that

365
00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:15.660
the not most people don't remember but another town and race in both places the

366
00:30:17.861 --> 00:30:22.861
Athenians killed all the adult males on the island when they finally put an end

367
00:30:25.441 --> 00:30:29.710
to the siege and sold the women and children into slavery.

368
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:35.310
See Athenians had every reason to fear that that might be what happened to them

369
00:30:35.311 --> 00:30:36.150
as a matter of fact.

370
00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:40.050
<v 4>Cormorants and thieves in the conference they had at the end of the war said</v>

371
00:30:40.051 --> 00:30:40.884
let's do that

372
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:47.380
Saban's especially said let's turn Attica into pasture land.

373
00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:50.620
<v 2>Well the Spartans didn't do it.</v>

374
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:56.110
And the main reason they gave was well it would be wrong to treat such a people

375
00:30:56.111 --> 00:31:00.280
that way such a people who helped us in such a critical way as our partner

376
00:31:00.281 --> 00:31:02.170
against the Persians when we won our freedom.

377
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:06.040
Well if you can believe that you can believe anything more to the point I think

378
00:31:06.041 --> 00:31:09.330
was their fear that if they did destroy Attica.

379
00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:14.910
I mean the the the the houses and the people and all that what would happen is

380
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:19.840
this would really be a vacuum a vacuum of people of everything else and

381
00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:22.810
certainly a vacuum of power and it wouldn't stay that way very long.

382
00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:28.530
Thieves and it's ocean subordinates would come in and occupy it and that was not

383
00:31:28.811 --> 00:31:33.760
a desirable thing.
And so the Spartans didn't do that.

384
00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:39.030
Instead with lice sand they're very much in charge of the settlement that was

385
00:31:39.821 --> 00:31:44.821
going to be imposed on the Athenians they placed in power a small group of.

386
00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:53.670
Oligarchic Athenians just as by the way he had the same kind of people in the

387
00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:58.580
rest of the Empire but not ten.
Athens was a very big place.

388
00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:03.890
It turned out that there were to be 30 of these new rulers of Attica all of whom

389
00:32:07.251 --> 00:32:12.251
had to meet the criterion of being acceptable to lie Sandor and the leaders of

390
00:32:14.691 --> 00:32:19.691
which the really important top gun was a man by the name of Christy as a

391
00:32:20.721 --> 00:32:23.840
nobleman who had participated in democracy.

392
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:28.610
But it turned very sharply against it.
He was a brilliant man.

393
00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:33.700
Apparently he had been trained by the great red attrition and sophist Gort

394
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:34.583
Gheorghe yes.

395
00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:40.780
And he was also in the circle of Socrates along with Plato and Xenophon and

396
00:32:43.071 --> 00:32:46.970
various other bright young men of the upper classes in Athens.

397
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:53.110
And he was a poet an orator himself a philosopher and so on.

398
00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.780
He had and some of his.

399
00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:01.640
Fragments of some of his works remain for us to look at

400
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:08.950
but one thing that he was by for or for was a bitter enemy of the democracy.

401
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:15.070
He had been exiled or had voluntarily taken exile in order to get away from the

402
00:33:16.401 --> 00:33:21.401
democracy and he was determined now that there should be no democracy in Athens

403
00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.500
does this say a word about that for a moment.

404
00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:31.480
<v 4>It was an easy point of view to arrive at four or four people who were not</v>

405
00:33:31.481 --> 00:33:36.481
friendly to democracy could simply point to the fact that the democracy had just

406
00:33:36.791 --> 00:33:41.791
lost this great war and nobody could really understand how that had happened

407
00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:47.490
given the great power of Athens and of course it was easy to point to the great

408
00:33:47.621 --> 00:33:52.300
event that turned the tide against Athens the Sicilian expedition and to say

409
00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:57.540
this was an idiotic idea and it was exactly the kind of idiotic idea that a

410
00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:03.960
democracy would come up with and so that democracy itself was seen to be not

411
00:34:05.951 --> 00:34:10.410
just
how can I put but I was gonna say.

412
00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:15.840
<v 2>Let me say it was seen to be inherently wicked because it violated what seemed</v>

413
00:34:18.191 --> 00:34:23.191
to be the truth about human beings and which was very much a part of all Greek

414
00:34:24.611 --> 00:34:29.611
tradition from the first time we hear about it in Homer until well forever which

415
00:34:30.731 --> 00:34:35.731
was contrary to the principle of democracy which is that all men adult male

416
00:34:37.241 --> 00:34:42.241
citizens are equal in some very fundamental way or should be was the the

417
00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:50.580
contrary view which had much greater support in Greek tradition that no men were

418
00:34:50.711 --> 00:34:54.220
in fact divided into different kinds of people.

419
00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:59.460
And in fact the Greeks thought a division into two kinds was the right kind.

420
00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:02.550
The most important kind.

421
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:08.470
A division between the high and the low between the good and the bad between the

422
00:35:10.271 --> 00:35:11.740
noble and the base.

423
00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.270
<v 8>And each of those pairs.</v>

424
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:20.630
<v 2>They were all the same people you're you're rich you're wise you're well born or</v>

425
00:35:22.531 --> 00:35:27.531
I should say you're rich and well born therefore you're wise or you are not and

426
00:35:29.371 --> 00:35:32.460
if you're not you're obviously not equal to the other guys and therefore you

427
00:35:32.461 --> 00:35:34.770
shouldn't have anything to do with ruling anybody.

428
00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:40.220
So that was the basic widespread view of what was natural in the Greek world.

429
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:47.570
Now you add to that that they have just lost this terrible war and you could

430
00:35:48.061 --> 00:35:52.980
point to what seemed to you to be both a wickedness and foolishness.

431
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:57.960
How in the world could anybody think democracy was a good thing after that.

432
00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:01.200
Lest you think there's is something special about that that's such a

433
00:36:01.201 --> 00:36:06.201
characteristic of the human race when whenever you have a great war and if you

434
00:36:08.941 --> 00:36:13.941
have two different kinds of political systems vying with each other winning has

435
00:36:15.931 --> 00:36:18.520
an amazing effect on what people think.

436
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:24.140
So that it was the take the first world war when the it's let me back up.

437
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:28.080
Yeah.

438
00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:33.080
No let me back up let me just say that those countries who lost the war were

439
00:36:34.651 --> 00:36:39.651
very open to the idea that whatever they typically had been monarchies and so

440
00:36:39.901 --> 00:36:40.140
on.

441
00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:45.140
But they had been rather relatively speaking liberal monarchies they had become.

442
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.660
<v 1>Legislatures and elections and things like that.</v>

443
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:56.960
And what came to be seen that was came to be seen as a losing proposition.

444
00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:02.840
And so fascism of one sort or another took root across Europe in states that had

445
00:37:04.081 --> 00:37:09.081
had that misfortune and that it was felt that success or failure had to do with

446
00:37:11.011 --> 00:37:14.820
the rightness of the wrongness of wisdom of the foolishness of the kinds of

447
00:37:14.821 --> 00:37:18.300
arrangements that you had.
And then when.

448
00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:24.900
While the Soviet Union was powerful and expanding around the world it was

449
00:37:24.901 --> 00:37:29.610
expanding and part along with the idea of communism which was thought in the

450
00:37:29.611 --> 00:37:34.611
circles where it succeeded to be superior to the competition and observe that

451
00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:38.490
when the Soviet Union finally collapsed.

452
00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:43.170
<v 9>There are maybe communists around the world they know but they don't admit it.</v>

453
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.690
I mean they call themselves something else.

454
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:51.050
The idea has been discredited by success of the competition by failure of that

455
00:37:53.191 --> 00:37:53.700
thing.

456
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:58.700
<v 4>So it's a phenomenon that is not amazing all this looks like the earliest</v>

457
00:37:59.761 --> 00:38:03.780
example I think that we know.
So

458
00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:06.120
critics.

459
00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:11.120
In any case was determined that Athens in the future would not be a democracy

460
00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:16.550
and in fact it looks like he was very much taken again.

461
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:21.710
This is typical with the with the virtues of Sparta because Sparta had won the

462
00:38:22.441 --> 00:38:23.274
war.

463
00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:28.610
So it's easy to say the characteristics that the Spartans stayed had must be

464
00:38:29.251 --> 00:38:34.251
good ones because they can do the most critical thing that a state can do win in

465
00:38:35.371 --> 00:38:37.980
competition with the other states.

466
00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:44.250
So he had in mind a very narrow oligarchy one scholar has suggested

467
00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:50.880
he actually had in mind to establish in Athens the closest facsimile he could of

468
00:38:51.521 --> 00:38:54.670
the Spartan constitution it could never be exactly the same.

469
00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:59.530
<v 2>But he was trying to do something like that that could be true but it was going</v>

470
00:38:59.531 --> 00:39:04.531
to be narrow a smallish number of people were going to control the city in fact.

471
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:10.900
Well let me back up before I'll come back to what I was about to say.

472
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:16.930
Now however when they set up to 30 to rule Athens in four or four.

473
00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:23.700
It was apparent to people who could judge matters pretty sensibly that given

474
00:39:26.291 --> 00:39:31.090
that Athens had been a democracy for over one hundred years that they would not

475
00:39:31.091 --> 00:39:34.060
be easy to impose such a regime.

476
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:39.870
And that if you made the regime too narrow and too oligarchical you might find

477
00:39:39.911 --> 00:39:44.911
yourself having trouble in keeping your your new regime in power.

478
00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:51.460
So like Sander agreed to the idea of making

479
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:57.960
the 30 compose of 20 men who were critics as men very extreme oligarchs but

480
00:40:00.041 --> 00:40:05.041
allowing ceramic kings and Athenian general who had flourished during the during

481
00:40:07.301 --> 00:40:12.190
the democracy but who was very clearly not an old fashioned Democrat.

482
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:17.670
He had taken part in bringing about the oligarchic revolution of 400 in the year

483
00:40:18.791 --> 00:40:19.624
for eleven

484
00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:26.090
and win it again and that the group who'd made that revolution was divided in

485
00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.140
something like the same way with the 30 would be.

486
00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:34.160
That is to say extreme oligarchs and people like ceremonies whom I guess it's

487
00:40:34.171 --> 00:40:38.310
fair to call moderate oligarchs although.

488
00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:43.530
<v 4>Oligarchs only I think in comparison with a thoroughgoing democracy.</v>

489
00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:48.330
Because if you ask the remedies what would be the right number of people in

490
00:40:48.331 --> 00:40:51.450
Athens to participate in the government.

491
00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:55.200
His answer was as it turned out 5000.

492
00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:58.950
But he really wasn't interested in that number.

493
00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:03.450
What he was interested in was the criteria for participation in government.

494
00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:08.930
And that was to be a hop light to have the wealth necessary to fight in the

495
00:41:11.401 --> 00:41:13.200
infantry for your city.

496
00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:18.780
In a later census not too much later it was discovered that the number of men in

497
00:41:18.781 --> 00:41:23.781
Athens who actually fit that description was not five thousand but nine thousand

498
00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:30.040
at a time when the Athenian population of adult males was something like twenty

499
00:41:30.451 --> 00:41:31.590
one thousand.

500
00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:37.140
So that nine out nine out of twenty one would have been the people who

501
00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:42.410
participated in the regime twelve out of the twenty one would have been too poor

502
00:41:42.481 --> 00:41:46.380
for that would not have been allowed to participate.
Well that's not a democracy.

503
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:50.520
It is an oligarchy but it's a very broad oligarchy.

504
00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:54.060
The word moderate I think applies.

505
00:41:56.070 --> 00:42:01.070
So anyway so Romney's was to be given the opportunity to appoint nine others

506
00:42:01.861 --> 00:42:03.000
besides himself.

507
00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:08.300
So there were tens of Romanians 20 supporters of critics in the 30 and that was

508
00:42:08.641 --> 00:42:13.641
to turn out to be a problem for the 30 as it had been for the 400 because when

509
00:42:16.081 --> 00:42:21.081
ceramic he saw that his colleagues in the 400 were trying to establish a narrow

510
00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:26.150
oligarchy he led an uprising that overthrew that oligarchy and ended up finally

511
00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:28.140
restoring the democracy.

512
00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:31.770
So that's the picture of what's going on in Athens.

513
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:38.030
But Athens of course was also inhabited at that time by all of the exiles who

514
00:42:39.721 --> 00:42:44.280
had been sent into exile during the democracy and they were bitter enemies of

515
00:42:44.281 --> 00:42:46.610
the Democrats at least lots of them.

516
00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:49.550
So you had a kind of a.

517
00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:54.690
Confrontation of different ideas and feelings.

518
00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:59.960
That was a little unusual in Athens Athens had been a pretty easygoing place

519
00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:04.530
before the war and even then throughout the war and to a large degree.

520
00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:09.830
<v 2>But now there were very hard divisions and very tense feelings between the</v>

521
00:43:10.441 --> 00:43:11.280
different groups

522
00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:18.140
the 30 ruled between September of 4 0 4 and May of 400 and 3 just a matter of

523
00:43:23.711 --> 00:43:27.490
months as it turned out although nobody of course knew who was going to be so

524
00:43:27.491 --> 00:43:28.920
short when things got started

525
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:35.090
they established a council of five hundred.

526
00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:38.660
<v 4>Well that's the same number as the Athenian council.
But it was quite different.</v>

527
00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:43.640
It was made up of extreme oligarchs.
They were given judicial powers

528
00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:50.100
men who were identified as sycophants and the Greek use of that term you

529
00:43:50.101 --> 00:43:55.101
remember is people who made money out of denouncing people on false charges in

530
00:43:58.531 --> 00:44:03.030
the courts and then winning payments as a result.

531
00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:07.020
They were very widely unpopular even in the democracy.

532
00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:12.350
And so the 30 began with an act that was not unpopular by putting to death all

533
00:44:13.111 --> 00:44:15.930
the sycophants that they could find and identify.

534
00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:18.840
But they also put to death.

535
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:24.820
This well-known leaders of the democracy people whom they knew would be their

536
00:44:24.821 --> 00:44:26.410
political opponents.

537
00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:31.770
So it was bloody from the first but it was only limited to a certain small

538
00:44:34.361 --> 00:44:38.860
portion of the population
the 30.

539
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:42.770
I mean just to make the case that actually a man who makes this case a man named

540
00:44:42.771 --> 00:44:46.120
Peter Krentz and he is an old yeller.

541
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:48.740
<v 10>So we ought to give him credit he</v>

542
00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:54.820
if you look at the 30 what if you look at Sparta.

543
00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:56.120
<v 2>What what comes to your mind.</v>

544
00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:03.990
<v 4>Did you ever see a ultimately in the course of these months the</v>

545
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:10.870
30 limited citizenship active participation in the government of any kind to

546
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:16.670
only three thousand Athenians out of what would have been you know at least

547
00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:21.570
21000 and probably more.
Only these had citizen rights.

548
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:25.970
The rest of the Athenians did not.
Well that's about it.

549
00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:30.060
How many Spartans there were at this time in history.

550
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:35.460
Another thing they did was to at a certain point when life got tough they drove

551
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:40.790
from the city of Athens all those who were not part of the three thousand.

552
00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:46.950
Well what do you call people like that who don't live in the capital city but

553
00:45:46.951 --> 00:45:49.760
who live around Perry oi oi.

554
00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:55.340
And so that's why Krantz suggests that this is not an accident that it's a

555
00:45:55.681 --> 00:46:00.681
conscious effort to model the future Athenian state upon the great successful

556
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:06.720
admirable Spartan state wealth the remedies didn't like that.

557
00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:12.260
This was far too narrow and far too troubling for the future truth.

558
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:15.983
The remedies.

559
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:19.260
And indeed he pointed out the contradiction you just how clever is this.

560
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:22.890
Here you are a minority in this state.

561
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:27.620
And instead of trying to bring on more people to make yourself stronger you're

562
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:31.710
driving out people and guaranteeing that you will have more people against you

563
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:33.400
than you have for you.

564
00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:39.890
He's himself favourite as he had in the time of the 400.

565
00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:45.280
He favored a hop like census anybody who could be a hop light could be a full

566
00:46:46.851 --> 00:46:49.820
fledged citizen.
And I've told you about the numbers.

567
00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:56.440
Well pretty soon the 30 became people objected to what the 30 was doing made

568
00:46:59.901 --> 00:47:04.040
complaints and the 30 began to go after them.

569
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:11.260
<v 9>At different times there one of the problems about talking about the 30 is that</v>

570
00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:16.830
it is not perfectly clear what is the chronology of events and I can't tell you

571
00:47:18.941 --> 00:47:22.590
with certainty what happened but in what order these things happen.

572
00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:27.660
<v 8>But at some point in here the the 30 began to attack a larger group of Athenians</v>

573
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.590
sometimes because they were seen to be political opponents or thought to be

574
00:47:35.591 --> 00:47:38.770
political opponents or related to political opponents.

575
00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:44.250
Sometimes when things got really bad when the 30 needed money they actually put

576
00:47:44.861 --> 00:47:49.840
people to death just because they were rich so that they could take their money

577
00:47:49.841 --> 00:47:50.674
away.

578
00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:55.770
<v 11>And this of course increased the amount of resistance on unhappiness so that</v>

579
00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:03.870
finally a small I want to emphasize small very small group of Athenians fled the

580
00:48:07.841 --> 00:48:12.841
city and went into exile to neighboring cities.

581
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:17.000
And this is interesting I think an important.

582
00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:22.060
The cities that were most receptive to these A.I..

583
00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:26.600
<v 4>30 A.I.
oligarchical anti Spartan</v>

584
00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:33.640
people the one that it was who received them most readily were Khan's Mega and

585
00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:40.040
sees all enemies of Athens all enemies of democracy.

586
00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:43.760
Why are they doing this.

587
00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:49.450
The answer is they are both angry at the Spartans and I think fearful that the

588
00:48:50.911 --> 00:48:55.911
Sparta that is a rising now will be a menace to their autonomy that they this

589
00:48:59.151 --> 00:49:03.260
particular towns with angry about different things currents and saves remember

590
00:49:03.261 --> 00:49:07.520
had wanted to destroy Athens entirely Spartans hadn't listened to them.

591
00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:13.160
<v 8>They all shared in the fighting and during that long war.</v>

592
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:18.080
But they did not share equally and not enough to suit them in the booty that was

593
00:49:18.081 --> 00:49:19.340
taken at the end of the war.

594
00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:24.400
So there were grievances that these towns had and so they accepted this small

595
00:49:25.251 --> 00:49:28.850
number of Athenians and the one town that was most important from this purpose

596
00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.120
was thieves and in.

597
00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:35.720
<v 0>They were given a decent home.</v>

598
00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:41.650
<v 8>The Spartans knowing about this sent out an order saying that no state should</v>

599
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:44.503
give any

600
00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:51.220
home to these exiles whereupon the seaborn regime at the moment voted that

601
00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:57.620
anybody who didn't give help to these Athenians would be punished.

602
00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:03.280
They simply were defying the Spartans on this question the leader the most

603
00:50:04.641 --> 00:50:07.760
important of the leaders of this group of exiles.

604
00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:12.230
It's fair to call them democratic exiles they wished to restore the old

605
00:50:12.231 --> 00:50:13.064
democracy.

606
00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:19.060
The most important man was thrashed the bullies who had been a general both his

607
00:50:20.391 --> 00:50:25.130
best fighting had been done as an admiral during the latter part of the

608
00:50:25.131 --> 00:50:29.190
Peloponnesian War.
He was present at all the great Athenian victories.

609
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:33.740
He was not present at the great defeat that ended the war.

610
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:41.470
He and another important politician by the name of anarchists actually began a

611
00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:47.750
counter-revolution and they with a very small number of men.

612
00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:53.820
The sources differ but the accounts that seem to be most plausible with only

613
00:50:54.391 --> 00:50:56.220
seven seventy men.

614
00:50:56.970 --> 00:51:01.970
They went from Thebes to a natural fortress in the mountains between Thebes

615
00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:08.660
between the OCA and Attica a place called finally and build the fort there to

616
00:51:11.341 --> 00:51:12.270
which they hoped.

617
00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:17.960
Other discontented Athenians would flee and join them in the resistance.

618
00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:22.920
And I'm using the word resistance and it brings to mind of course an analogy

619
00:51:22.921 --> 00:51:26.970
that has always struck me as helpful in comprehending the situation confronting

620
00:51:26.971 --> 00:51:28.320
the Athenians at this time.

621
00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:34.280
To my mind it is helpful to think about France in June of 1940 after the Germans

622
00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:44.570
had defeated France and occupied part of it and left the other part unoccupied

623
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:51.470
but absolutely beholden to the Nazi regime.

624
00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:57.260
<v 9>Now a Frenchman had three choices and just as the Athenians did.</v>

625
00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:03.700
One possibility would be to join up with the new regime and try to prosper as

626
00:52:04.521 --> 00:52:06.460
part of it.
And some Athenians did that.

627
00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:08.543
<v 12>Others</v>

628
00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:14.300
would do whatever has to be listed and in the France it was the goal.

629
00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:15.080
Who did this.

630
00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:19.070
Who happened to be in London at the time this happened then he began to organize

631
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:22.970
to undo what had happened and to throw the Germans out.

632
00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.940
It established the Free French Forces.

633
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:30.650
It's important to realize that after the war was over it's amazing how large

634
00:52:30.651 --> 00:52:34.310
that Free French force had grown in people's minds.

635
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:37.580
In reality it was a handful of people.

636
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:42.860
And that's the way it always is and that's the way it was in Athens as well.

637
00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:48.310
It was a terrifying prospect to tackle this regime which looked like it was

638
00:52:48.951 --> 00:52:49.790
unbeatable.

639
00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:54.980
Remember they had been put in place by the Spartans the Spartans ruled the
world.

640
00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:59.840
What in what could what can anybody expect to change that situation.

641
00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:04.640
Just as the Nazis looked like they were in business for the thousand years that

642
00:53:04.641 --> 00:53:09.230
Hitler had claimed he was going to have it so that it didn't look like you were

643
00:53:09.231 --> 00:53:12.920
a very courageous man.
If you joined the goal.

644
00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:16.960
I don't know how many how many have you seen Casablanca.

645
00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:20.740
<v 2>At least you've seen one movie in your life.
That's great.</v>

646
00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:23.830
But you remember what.

647
00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:28.950
What are Claude Rains and Bogie doing at the end of the war when he says Louis I

648
00:53:30.011 --> 00:53:31.960
think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

649
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:36.820
<v 12>When he says that they're going to press avail to join the Free French.</v>

650
00:53:37.210 --> 00:53:41.020
Well great.
But what what did people think about to go.

651
00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:46.010
They thought he was a god damn fool.
There was no chance.
This was idiocy.

652
00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:47.740
Sensible men what are they trying to do.

653
00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:53.100
They tried to win as much as they could in collaborating with the Germans to to

654
00:53:53.891 --> 00:53:58.891
make their the fate of the Frenchman less hard and to help France in the future

655
00:53:59.081 --> 00:53:59.914
in that way.

656
00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:03.250
That's the way it was with most Athenians most Frenchmen and most Athenians

657
00:54:03.251 --> 00:54:04.460
didn't do either of those things.

658
00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:10.560
<v 9>They kept their heads down and tried to live their lives as best they could.</v>

659
00:54:11.590 --> 00:54:15.310
And I think that's I think what you need to understand is happening and it all

660
00:54:15.311 --> 00:54:20.311
puts what's Rasta bullies and amateurs and their friends did in a very special

661
00:54:20.831 --> 00:54:21.664
kind of a light.

662
00:54:22.090 --> 00:54:27.090
These were extraordinarily brave extraordinarily rash and extraordinarily

663
00:54:28.511 --> 00:54:33.310
optimistic people.
And as it happened in this case it worked for them.

664
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:34.503
Amazingly.

665
00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:39.950
They begin to gather forces that are helping them.

666
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:45.200
It's very another interesting point is that it's remarkable how few of the

667
00:54:45.201 --> 00:54:49.280
people with threats of bullies were actually Athenian citizens.

668
00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:54.940
A surprising number of them were permanent resident aliens medics who of course

669
00:54:55.641 --> 00:55:00.641
were great targets for the 30 because they were typically well-off and had

670
00:55:00.951 --> 00:55:03.890
money.
And of course they had no rights and no power.

671
00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:06.290
So many of them most.

672
00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:10.220
Most of the medics were certainly on the Democratic side of this argument.

673
00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:15.580
Many of them went to fight others like Lizzy as the orator used his money to

674
00:55:16.581 --> 00:55:21.300
hire mercenary soldiers to fight for the threats of bullies.

675
00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:23.030
Democrats as well.

676
00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:27.140
Well the first test came in the months of January.

677
00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:33.220
There were this 70 guys or so up in the fortress on finally by now the 30 were

678
00:55:35.151 --> 00:55:40.151
worried enough about this nascent army to send an army of their own much bigger

679
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:42.680
to try to get them.

680
00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:46.420
And it's at this point that I'm always reminded again.

681
00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:50.140
<v 10>Talk about analogies of
the</v>

682
00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:55.980
events of great britain in the 16th century England.

683
00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:58.440
I should say really in the 16th century.

684
00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:04.580
<v 9>When the Spanish Armada was heading for England trying to gain control of the</v>

685
00:56:07.051 --> 00:56:12.051
island for the pope and Catholicism one thing and another and what happened was

686
00:56:13.921 --> 00:56:18.921
that nature if you will or as the British thought of it maybe God intervene as

687
00:56:21.961 --> 00:56:26.961
this then the Armada was coming out great wind came up and it blew the ships out

688
00:56:28.921 --> 00:56:31.440
of their path and wrecked many of them.

689
00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:36.470
<v 8>And really the British the English fleet didn't do anywhere near as much damage</v>

690
00:56:36.721 --> 00:56:41.721
to the Spanish fleet as did the winds and so from that day forward there sprang

691
00:56:43.951 --> 00:56:48.951
up the legend in England of the Protestant wind which had come along to save the

692
00:56:51.381 --> 00:56:54.290
new English faith against the forces of the pope.

693
00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:58.520
Well if they can invent the Protestant wind I think it's OK for me to speak

694
00:56:58.521 --> 00:57:03.521
about the Democratic snow that fell on finally that went good.

695
00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:06.020
That's just what happened.

696
00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:11.410
Big snowstorm came up and so when the forces of the 30 came after ACT THREE I

697
00:57:12.321 --> 00:57:14.750
suppose they could this couldn't do it.
They just couldn't get there.

698
00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:16.880
They were fought off.
They had to retreat.

699
00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:22.040
And as they retreated the seventh came down after them and chased them and kill

700
00:57:22.041 --> 00:57:25.250
them as they fled.
And then a certain amount of damage.

701
00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:29.870
And the time the passage of time was very important because more and more

702
00:57:29.871 --> 00:57:34.871
Athenians were becoming hostile to the regime that they had fallen under and

703
00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:41.860
they more and more of them although again it is amazing how few actual Athenians

704
00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:43.300
joined the rest of the list.

705
00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:49.030
<v 4>But by this time threads ceramic these had come into the picture.</v>

706
00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:53.060
He was more and more unhappy with what was happening.

707
00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:58.420
He stood up in the council and argued against critics and critics finally had

708
00:57:59.871 --> 00:58:01.160
him put to death.

709
00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:07.720
That was in an indication of how far the reactionary forces in the state had

710
00:58:09.441 --> 00:58:10.670
come and

711
00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:17.330
we might mention also that the ancient sources estimate that something like

712
00:58:17.361 --> 00:58:22.361
fifteen hundred Athenians may have been killed by the thirty tyrants.

713
00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:27.770
Well that's a very large percentage of the population when you think about how

714
00:58:27.771 --> 00:58:29.660
many Athenians there were.

715
00:58:30.170 --> 00:58:35.170
And finally that caused so many of their relatives and friends to turn against

716
00:58:38.571 --> 00:58:43.571
the 30 and to join forces even if they didn't go out there and fight to be on

717
00:58:43.731 --> 00:58:45.350
the side of the Democrats.

718
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:51.670
A second attack on finally taken at a later time failed.

719
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.960
And now suddenly threats of bullies had a large enough force.

720
00:58:57.290 --> 00:59:01.190
He marched to the pirates and gained control of that.

721
00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:06.880
When the 30 brought an army out to try to defeat him there he defeated.

722
00:59:07.650 --> 00:59:12.650
Then they were forced to flee to looses on the north western frontier of Attica

723
00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:18.320
and the Democrats were.

724
00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:23.090
<v 9>About in position to take control of the city.</v>

725
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:28.510
Again the 30 words imposed by the three thousand because it was obvious they

726
00:59:29.911 --> 00:59:30.744
were losers.

727
00:59:31.350 --> 00:59:36.350
And now the 3000 the successor government to to the thirty appealed to Sparta

728
00:59:39.450 --> 00:59:42.360
for help against this Democratic Army.

729
00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:47.540
That's Rasta Bolas had put out well think about what should Sparta do and you

730
00:59:48.911 --> 00:59:52.150
might have thought it would be obvious certainly what life Sandow wanted to do

731
00:59:52.151 --> 00:59:56.590
is no surprise he wanted to send a big army to restore the oligarchs.

732
00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.340
To put his own people back in power.

733
01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:06.030
And of course that was fine but there were people in Sparta who didn't want to

734
01:00:07.781 --> 01:00:08.614
do that.

735
01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:13.890
Who saw this as an opportunity to deprive life Sander of his power and influence

736
01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:18.760
and to restore a more normal situation in Sparta.

737
01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:22.840
And so the Spartans did vote to send an army.

738
01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:28.210
In there to deal with Rasta bullies but they did not put lice Sander at the head

739
01:00:28.211 --> 01:00:30.070
of the army or even one of his people.

740
01:00:30.550 --> 01:00:35.550
Instead King poor seniors was sent out to do the job well.

741
01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:42.210
<v 8>They met the Athenian army under threats of bullies and defeated threats of</v>

742
01:00:42.211 --> 01:00:43.830
bullies.
But they did not

743
01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:50.420
try to obliterate that army or as we shall see treat them as very serious

744
01:00:51.841 --> 01:00:52.560
enemies.

745
01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:56.940
For one thing the Athenians again as they had in the past fought bravely and

746
01:00:56.941 --> 01:01:01.941
well and inflicted serious losses on the Spartan army but also it was obvious

747
01:01:03.031 --> 01:01:07.530
that parsimonious was willing to negotiate a settlement.

748
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:12.420
He wasn't insistent upon defeating the Athenians and imposing a settlement.

749
01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:18.110
And so they worked out an agreement whereby a moderate group of ten would be

750
01:01:19.321 --> 01:01:24.270
chosen in Athens and poor seniors and his.

751
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:29.430
And a commission sent from Sparta to sit with poor seniors sat down with these

752
01:01:29.431 --> 01:01:34.260
Athenians and worked out a reconciliation for the future.

753
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:39.330
<v 9>And here is the essence of what was worked out a very important part of the</v>

754
01:01:39.331 --> 01:01:44.330
story was that they voted the Athenians did and pesetas of course would've

755
01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:49.340
insisted on it to an amnesty whereby there would be no punishment for people on

756
01:01:51.681 --> 01:01:55.970
one side or the other of the quarrel in Athens of course the people who would

757
01:01:55.971 --> 01:02:00.971
have been punished would have been oligarchs and their friends who were now the

758
01:02:01.071 --> 01:02:02.510
losing side.

759
01:02:04.030 --> 01:02:07.890
There would be an amnesty for anybody no matter what except for the 30

760
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:08.850
themselves.

761
01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:15.240
The Ten that the thirty had put in charge of the pie pioneers the eleven the

762
01:02:16.330 --> 01:02:21.330
eleven worthy the police force so to speak the head of the security forces in

763
01:02:22.601 --> 01:02:25.180
Athens and so on.

764
01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:29.920
Small groups of people who were thought to be especially responsible for the

765
01:02:29.921 --> 01:02:32.290
nasty things that had happened in Athens.

766
01:02:32.830 --> 01:02:35.830
But even they were not summarily put to death.

767
01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:41.640
They could submit their accounts at an A you soon I and.

768
01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:47.670
And if they were cleared at these jury trials or things that I shouldn't call

769
01:02:47.961 --> 01:02:50.170
them jury trials tribunals really.

770
01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:55.600
They could take up their position as citizens in the new Athens as well or they

771
01:02:55.601 --> 01:02:59.290
could be allowed freely to leave Athens without any harm.

772
01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:02.620
So it was a very moderate conclusion.

773
01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:06.820
What about real oligarchs.
What about them.

774
01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:10.570
Well they even they were taken care of the town of a loosies which they had

775
01:03:10.571 --> 01:03:13.090
seized for their own protection.

776
01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:18.180
<v 8>As things were going badly they were allowed to stay there after the settlement</v>

777
01:03:21.350 --> 01:03:26.350
now that left thoracic bullies and his friends in control in Athens and they

778
01:03:26.631 --> 01:03:31.631
immediately reinstated the democratic constitution pretty much as it had been

779
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:36.420
before.
All of this had happened.

780
01:03:37.370 --> 01:03:42.370
Briefly in this period of transition citizenship was limited to the top three

781
01:03:42.441 --> 01:03:47.441
Salonen classes but that quickly fell through and really the full democracy was

782
01:03:48.801 --> 01:03:53.801
restored in the year 400 and 1 in the same year the Democrats seized a looses

783
01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:57.350
and brought that back into Attica.

784
01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:02.800
So if you're there in the air 400 Athens would be seemed to be exactly as it had

785
01:04:03.861 --> 01:04:08.861
been internally before the defeat in the Peloponnesian War.

786
01:04:11.650 --> 01:04:16.650
And that newly restored democracy behaved with remarkable moderation.

787
01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:23.410
Aristotle in this Constitution of the Athenians goes out of his way to praise

788
01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:26.770
this successor Athenian regime.

789
01:04:27.250 --> 01:04:29.740
They kept closely to the amnesty.

790
01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:34.800
They did not in fact prosecute people that they should not have done.

791
01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:38.680
On the other hand they and some.

792
01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:44.100
And Aristotle praises this too because he also is I guess his sympathies are

793
01:04:44.501 --> 01:04:46.450
very close to those of remedies

794
01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:52.630
to moderate oligarchy or what Aristotle would call polity a.

795
01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:54.580
Moderate regime.

796
01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:01.080
<v 5>When thoracic bullies ask this is an amazing thing when he ask that those people</v>

797
01:05:01.811 --> 01:05:06.450
who had served in his army who had liberated Athens and restored the democracy

798
01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:12.520
that these people be granted Athenian citizenship the Athenian people voted no.

799
01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:21.190
<v 12>To me that is one of the most striking evidences of how the Greeks really felt</v>

800
01:05:22.901 --> 01:05:27.901
about their polls because even in a situation like that the idea of sharing

801
01:05:28.181 --> 01:05:33.181
citizenship with anybody who was not so to speak a member of the family was

802
01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:36.250
beyond what they would contemplate.

803
01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:41.280
And even with Raza bullies the great hero the great liberator asking them to do

804
01:05:41.861 --> 01:05:43.690
it they said no dice.

805
01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:49.220
They also repaid the debts that the 30 had accumulated.

806
01:05:49.730 --> 01:05:54.680
What they were doing of course was trying to get things calm as fast as they

807
01:05:54.681 --> 01:05:59.480
could to achieve stability.
It's a very rare thing.

808
01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:03.650
Imagine.
Well think of what the French did when the war was over.

809
01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:07.270
They took their collaborators they tried them and they killed them.

810
01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:11.840
For the most part that's that's what civilized people do.

811
01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:17.150
I mean look what they did in Rwanda and other places like that where different

812
01:06:17.151 --> 01:06:21.320
sides in a civil war simply butcher each other.
That's a very normal situation.

813
01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.440
What do you think as it was very abnormal.

814
01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:29.920
It was evidence I think in part of a great deal of wisdom on the part of the key

815
01:06:31.011 --> 01:06:32.120
leaders at the time.

816
01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:37.070
And I think it also shows you that Athens over the many years of its democracy

817
01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:42.530
had not had sharp edges between the classes.

818
01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:47.560
I think there was a general kind of good feeling that made that sort of mass

819
01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:52.610
execution something that seemed foreign and to undesirable

820
01:06:54.270 --> 01:06:59.270
so if we look at Athens and in for a one that democracy has been completely

821
01:07:00.810 --> 01:07:01.643
restored.

822
01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:06.860
And I'd like to draw my comments about this to close by focusing on threats of

823
01:07:08.811 --> 01:07:09.270
bullies.

824
01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:14.270
A man who I think probably none of you had ever heard his name when you came

825
01:07:16.141 --> 01:07:19.250
into this class you'd heard of Pericles please you may have heard of the mystic

826
01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:21.660
leads to lots of different things.

827
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:26.850
You never heard of surrounds the bullets so you might be surprised to hear the

828
01:07:26.851 --> 01:07:27.684
following.

829
01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:33.750
Cornelius Naples a Roman historian of the 1st century B.C. writing lives of

830
01:07:35.951 --> 01:07:40.951
famous Greeks and Romans wrote the following about threats of Charles if

831
01:07:41.941 --> 01:07:45.990
excellence were to be weighed by itself.
Apart from luck.

832
01:07:46.590 --> 01:07:49.110
<v 4>I believe I would rank this man.</v>

833
01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:53.530
<v 11>First of all this much is certain.</v>

834
01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:59.280
I put no one ahead of him in sense of honor steadfastness greatness of soul and

835
01:08:00.821 --> 01:08:02.610
love of country any better.

836
01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:06.170
<v 13>But it's not the end.</v>

837
01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:12.780
<v 9>A few years before one hundred and eighty A.D. parsimonious the great travel</v>

838
01:08:13.481 --> 01:08:18.481
writer of antiquity wrote his guide to the famous and historic places of ancient

839
01:08:19.251 --> 01:08:20.084
Greece.

840
01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:25.560
In the section on Athens he described the graves of the heroes and men that

841
01:08:26.841 --> 01:08:31.841
lined the roads outside the city beginning with the one leading to the place

842
01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:33.740
known as the Academy.

843
01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:37.940
Here's what Paul saying is the travel writer says.

844
01:08:38.810 --> 01:08:39.643
The first.

845
01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:45.100
Is that of threats to bolus son of life lifeless in every way.

846
01:08:47.050 --> 01:08:52.050
The greatest of all famous Athenians whether they lived before or after him.

847
01:08:55.590 --> 01:09:00.590
Think of all the names that are involved in the and maybe the weights of course

848
01:09:01.661 --> 01:09:06.661
Amos is general comparison is intensified by something a little bit more

849
01:09:07.501 --> 01:09:12.501
specific because the next words in poor seniors account is Are these his is the

850
01:09:14.461 --> 01:09:19.461
first grave and after it comes that of Pericles just in case you thought he

851
01:09:22.211 --> 01:09:23.620
missed Pericles by mistake.

852
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:26.540
<v 12>Now that's extraordinary.</v>

853
01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:30.560
And it is a great puzzle that I've never.

854
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:34.070
I can't solve and probably never can be solved.
But.

855
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:39.550
How could it be that these fellows who lived centuries afterwards said these

856
01:09:41.061 --> 01:09:44.640
things about threats of bullies and we never heard of them.

857
01:09:45.830 --> 01:09:47.020
<v 9>I mean barely heard of him.</v>

858
01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:53.270
I mean the best answer I can give you is there must have been lost history's and

859
01:09:54.150 --> 01:09:59.150
we know there are of the period and they must have given threats the bull was

860
01:09:59.191 --> 01:10:04.191
the kind of credit for their his remarkable achievements that don't show up in

861
01:10:05.730 --> 01:10:09.340
Xenophon and diverse and the orators.

862
01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:12.000
But we at last.

863
01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:17.990
And you have an obligation to future generations must not let the name of

864
01:10:18.331 --> 01:10:21.780
thoracic bolus lie in obscurity again.

865
01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:25.690
And just so that you don't forget him.
Remember he.

866
01:10:25.770 --> 01:10:30.770
He is the only Greek I know whose whose name fits a Yale fight song irascible

867
01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:36.320
love is possible those.
