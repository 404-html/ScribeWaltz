1
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.680
My sister just died in 527 with all his power and so far as we know peacefully.

2
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.770
And was succeeded in the tyranny over Athens by his sons by his first wife.

3
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.830
<v 1>Hippies.
Who was the elder and hip parkas.</v>

4
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.600
I think it's it's reasonable to think it's proper to think of hippies as the man

5
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:32.601
in charge but hip Farkas shared a considerable amount of his power and

6
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:36.600
responsibility.
At first.

7
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.550
It appears that they ruled in the same way that their father had which was to

8
00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:46.551
say one that was moderate and didn't cause a great deal of opposition.

9
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.963
In Athens.

10
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.050
And of course there always was a certain amount of opposition and we should not

11
00:00:55.051 --> 00:01:00.051
forget that aristocratic families always vying for their own power and their own

12
00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:06.741
position were uncomfortable very often under a price Judas and different ones.

13
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.360
Different families got into trouble and were driven out and our old friends the

14
00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:16.980
alchemy on it I got into trouble again were banished.

15
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.090
In the time of the sons of my sisters and it was necessary to fight to have a

16
00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:30.270
battle against them in which they were defeated and driven out.

17
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.520
I will play a significant role in the future of Athens quite soon but I think

18
00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:42.111
it's in the year 5 14 that a very important event changes the course of things.

19
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.140
There is a personal quarrel between the tyrants one of the tyrants actually and

20
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.580
one of the noble young men which results in a plot to kill both hippies and hip

21
00:01:57.581 --> 00:02:02.581
parkas led by two young men who will become known in feet in law as the

22
00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:09.891
tyrannosaur sides because in their plot they succeed in killing the younger

23
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:16.161
brother hip pockets although they don't get hippy as they themselves are killed.

24
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.370
<v 2>The plot fails but its significance I think comes in the fact that it made</v>

25
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.330
hippies thereafter very nervous very concerned about his safety and about the

26
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:34.731
future of his regime and the nature of the regime according to tradition changes

27
00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:38.250
and it becomes very harsh and there are

28
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.000
prosecutions of people who are suspected of perhaps plotting who are hoping to

29
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:49.860
plot against the tyranny and that's significant and that's a characteristic

30
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.190
event as I told you early on as I spoke about tyranny in general.

31
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.740
Usually in the second and sometimes if they made it to the third there would be

32
00:02:58.741 --> 00:02:59.490
opposition.

33
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.660
The opposition would make the rulers nervous the nervous rulers would then

34
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.520
misbehave and create further opposition.

35
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.720
And that's the story as it happens in Athens.

36
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.070
<v 3>One wrinkle in the Athenian story is that the</v>

37
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.610
alchemy on a guy who had been expelled from the city always active always

38
00:03:20.611 --> 00:03:21.444
thinking

39
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.100
became got into a position of especial favor to the Delphic oracle.

40
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.520
When there was an earthquake that badly damaged the temple of Apollo at Delphi

41
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.600
the alchemy on died bid for the contract to rebuild rebuild the temple and in

42
00:03:43.111 --> 00:03:48.111
the doing of that they spent some of their own money to make the temple even

43
00:03:48.751 --> 00:03:53.751
more beautiful than the contract required which put them in great favor with the

44
00:03:54.421 --> 00:03:59.421
priests of Delphi and they immediately cash this favor in in the form of seeking

45
00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:03.810
their own political advantage.

46
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.170
<v 2>The story as Herodotus tells it is that their goal was to drive out happiness</v>

47
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.580
from Athens and the way to do it this time.

48
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.700
Remember they've tried every trick in the world and it hasn't really work.

49
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.770
And the idea now is to turn to the most powerful military state in Greece and

50
00:04:22.771 --> 00:04:24.300
use it for their purposes.

51
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.330
I'm talking of course about Sparta and the tale is that whenever the Spartans

52
00:04:29.941 --> 00:04:34.941
sent a message to the Delphic oracle asking for an opportunity consult the

53
00:04:35.461 --> 00:04:36.294
oracle.

54
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.830
<v 4>The answer that came back was first free the Athenians.</v>

55
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.280
Well whether that was the reason or he had reasons of his own the very ambitious

56
00:04:47.281 --> 00:04:52.281
King of Sparta King Clay hominids was going to undertake the job of removing

57
00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:57.870
hippies from power in Athens quite soon.

58
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.560
It's in the year five eleven ten that the Spartans under clear nominees will

59
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.340
invade Attica gain control of the state and remove hippies and withdraw.

60
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.570
But we'll come back to that story in just a moment.

61
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.230
Let me conclude our consideration of the Athenian tyranny by looking at what

62
00:05:26.551 --> 00:05:31.551
were the achievements and consequences of the years of tyrannical rule.

63
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.690
Many positive elements as was so often the case with tyranny from the economic

64
00:05:39.421 --> 00:05:39.960
side.

65
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.960
This was a period of great expansion of Athenian commerce trade very strong to

66
00:05:49.021 --> 00:05:54.021
the east through the hell respond and to the Black Sea but also in this period.

67
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.210
Athens trades very strongly with the West.

68
00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:03.230
I meant to say chiefly Sicily and Italy and in fact up to that point up to those

69
00:06:04.741 --> 00:06:09.450
years roughly speaking currency and pottery fine currency and pottery is

70
00:06:09.451 --> 00:06:14.451
dominant in the western areas is no surprise that's always been the case for a

71
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:20.100
currency but by the end of the sixth century Athenian pottery has actually

72
00:06:21.691 --> 00:06:26.691
outstripped that in the Western markets which show you how much this combination

73
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.050
of trade industry was changing the character of Athens and making it wealthier

74
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.380
and bringing along various elements that of change in their way of life.

75
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.420
<v 1>Another consequence of the tyrannical experience in Athens was a diminution in</v>

76
00:06:49.621 --> 00:06:51.810
the power of the aristocracy.

77
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.340
<v 5>And this again the general story wherever we see tyranny in the Greek world it</v>

78
00:06:56.341 --> 00:07:01.341
never erases aristocracy you never see the disappearance of the distinction

79
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.740
between nobles and commoners and claims to the aristocracy of birth and descent

80
00:07:06.991 --> 00:07:08.460
from the gods.
It's always there.

81
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.050
And even in the most democratic of Athenian of Greek states like Athens for

82
00:07:13.051 --> 00:07:18.030
instance it did an aristocracy doesn't go away.
It's not abolished.

83
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.670
It live side by side with a democratic constitution.

84
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:27.410
But the DUP the domination by the aristocracy the monopoly of all the powers and

85
00:07:28.231 --> 00:07:29.580
influence that they used to have.

86
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:34.730
It's not there and that is a tremendously important consequence so that when the

87
00:07:35.671 --> 00:07:40.671
tyranny goes away and it's necessary to reconstruct a New Athenian constitution

88
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:47.540
the answer will not simply be a return to the old days before the tyrants so

89
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.780
long had intervened in an important way.

90
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.200
And the tyrants had made their contribution to to changes that turned out to be

91
00:07:57.391 --> 00:07:58.224
permanent.

92
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.520
It's also true that under the tyrants the local power of the noblemen had been

93
00:08:07.171 --> 00:08:12.171
reduced and the power of the government in Athens which was not dominated by the

94
00:08:12.331 --> 00:08:17.331
aristocracy but by the tyrants that was a trend and one of the issues that would

95
00:08:18.391 --> 00:08:23.070
have to be worked out would be what would be the relationship between the

96
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:27.900
localities outside of Athens and the city itself.

97
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:32.640
Localism has been damaged but not abolished.

98
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:39.170
<v 6>If there are going to be new forms of government that take place one of the</v>

99
00:08:40.511 --> 00:08:45.310
consequences one of the things I should say when the precursors of that will be

100
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:50.670
to further strengthen the centre and weaken the periphery and to continue to

101
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:58.890
strip as best one could the influence and power of the aristocracy which was

102
00:08:59.501 --> 00:09:04.501
mainly to be felt in the countryside and to increase the power of some other

103
00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.940
form of government which centre would be in Athens.

104
00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.340
On the other hand because of the reforms of so long which I remind you by

105
00:09:15.341 --> 00:09:20.341
sisters and his sons allowed to stay in place at least in the formal sense

106
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.200
because therefore every year.
Think about it.

107
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.440
People were elected Aachen people were chosen for a council.

108
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:37.110
Law Courts operated all of these things not dominated by the aristocracy but

109
00:09:38.951 --> 00:09:43.951
really in the case of the magistracy as the wealth.

110
00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.830
<v 7>Was the criterion Remember ever since so long.</v>

111
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:52.480
So that people who were not aristocrats but were wealthy also participated in

112
00:09:52.481 --> 00:09:57.481
those jobs and the council which was open to three out of the four Athenian

113
00:09:58.001 --> 00:10:03.001
classes under so long meant that people actually went to the council chamber

114
00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:08.490
participated in decisions about what was going on to be sure they weren't going

115
00:10:08.561 --> 00:10:12.700
to do anything that the tyrants didn't want but nineteen ninety five percent of

116
00:10:12.701 --> 00:10:17.050
the time may be more tyrant didn't care so that they were getting.

117
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:18.700
<v 8>This is the point I really want to stress.</v>

118
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:23.110
They were getting experience in the business of self-government.

119
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:29.520
And when you do that I think the history of the world shows that once people

120
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.720
have risen to that state where they do participate in their own self-government

121
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:39.910
it's very hard to get them back into a state when they don't anymore.

122
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.270
That's going to be very difficult to make stick.

123
00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:48.720
Athens has been moved down the road to self-government as a consequence.

124
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:54.010
Strangely enough of the tyranny just in passing I might point out that's not a

125
00:10:54.011 --> 00:10:54.910
unique phenomenon.

126
00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:01.020
It's very interesting to look back at the early post colonial age in the 20th

127
00:11:03.941 --> 00:11:08.941
century and to see that there were real differences between colonies that had

128
00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:11.230
been ruled in.

129
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:17.070
I would want to say tyrannical way but in an absolute way such as the Congo or

130
00:11:17.981 --> 00:11:22.981
other places like that as opposed to places that had achieved some degree of

131
00:11:23.771 --> 00:11:28.300
self-government even while they were ruled by a European power.

132
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.340
The difference was very great.

133
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:36.430
Once you have the same experience that I'm talking about now that led to the

134
00:11:36.431 --> 00:11:41.431
capacity and a determination to govern oneself was more likely in places where

135
00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:43.990
there had been some such thing.

136
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:49.090
<v 6>India of course is a striking example where the Indians had managed to achieve</v>

137
00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:54.390
some degree of participation in the government of their own state under the

138
00:11:54.731 --> 00:11:59.731
British who in spite of all the troubles they had have actually produced a

139
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:05.020
functioning relatively democratic government in that great subcontinent.

140
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.360
Well that's the sort of thing I'm talking about.

141
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.863
So.

142
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.220
Knowing what we now know looking backward is possible to say it looks like the

143
00:12:15.221 --> 00:12:20.140
tyranny played a very important role in the transition from aristocratic

144
00:12:20.141 --> 00:12:22.210
government to democracy.

145
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:26.170
That's not what the tyrants intended they intended to rule for as long as they

146
00:12:26.171 --> 00:12:30.340
could.
But it was one of the consequences as we will see.

147
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.800
<v 5>Well let's turn once again to those me on a day who had as you remember a</v>

148
00:12:40.541 --> 00:12:45.541
checkered past in Athens and even under the tyranny because they had been driven

149
00:12:46.061 --> 00:12:46.540
out.

150
00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:51.540
Remember mega Cleese had had his deal with my sister this had broken that

151
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.490
position is that broken that deal so he went into opposition.

152
00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:00.280
He and the army and I had driven out but they came back because we find Christ

153
00:13:00.281 --> 00:13:05.281
in his name on the list of our cons but then they had been driven out again and

154
00:13:06.491 --> 00:13:11.410
in the year five eleven ten Kleist Denise who was leader of the alchemy and had

155
00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:16.411
family and political faction was in exile and was working to get the Spartans to

156
00:13:18.401 --> 00:13:23.401
do the job that was done so please Minnie's takes his Spartan army in and 510 he

157
00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:27.010
drives out the tyrants and then he goes home.

158
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:32.530
Now the question that confronts the Athenians is what form of government should

159
00:13:32.531 --> 00:13:33.364
we have.

160
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:38.360
And again there's there's a whole range of possibilities not a whole range or a

161
00:13:38.361 --> 00:13:41.990
few possibilities that one would be reactionary.

162
00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:47.770
Let's go back to the days before so long when the aristocracy was everything.

163
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.910
There certainly as we will see where people who wanted to do something very much

164
00:13:52.911 --> 00:13:53.744
like that.

165
00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.920
On the other hand what are you going to do about all these people of consequence

166
00:13:57.921 --> 00:14:02.630
who are wealthy and who have made it to the top of the were not aristocrats and

167
00:14:02.631 --> 00:14:06.740
then what are you going to do about all of these family farmers of whom there

168
00:14:06.741 --> 00:14:09.380
must be more now than ever because of the.

169
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:14.710
My suggestion that by system this had taken away land from some exiled

170
00:14:14.901 --> 00:14:19.901
aristocrats and distributed among families some of whom were successful on farms

171
00:14:20.451 --> 00:14:25.451
and became hotplate soldiers and independent farmers they're not going to be

172
00:14:25.701 --> 00:14:30.701
enjoy being put back to a position which was worse than they had under the

173
00:14:30.711 --> 00:14:34.790
tyranny because under the tyranny they were sitting on councils and

174
00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:38.350
participating in these things and sitting in courts and now there's ever gonna

175
00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:43.360
be take all this was going to be taken away if the reactionary aristocracy had

176
00:14:43.731 --> 00:14:48.560
its way.
That was really what the contest was.
I think it should.

177
00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:53.920
Should we continue with the colonial constitution only without tyrants or should

178
00:14:55.281 --> 00:15:00.281
we go back to an aristocracy and the contest for how to decide that was done in

179
00:15:02.991 --> 00:15:05.180
the usual old fashioned way.

180
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:10.480
That is to say in the contest for the arcane ship the candidates on of holding

181
00:15:11.541 --> 00:15:16.190
one view ran against candidates holding the other view and that's where the

182
00:15:16.191 --> 00:15:20.840
matter would be sited be decided.
But they went at it in the old way.

183
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:26.140
That is the decisions were being made in the political clubs that belonged to

184
00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:28.460
the aristocracy.

185
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:32.450
In other words how we're going to do this was being fought out.

186
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:37.460
In the with among the aristocrats not among the public at large.

187
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.930
And in that contest

188
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:45.500
place the names who stood for the more moderate for the colonial let us say

189
00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:51.380
approach as his family had always done lost.

190
00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.830
The winner was a man called ISAC Iris an aristocrat.

191
00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:01.860
They were all of us to crash of course and he engages the I should say by the

192
00:16:03.131 --> 00:16:04.070
way we're talking now.

193
00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:09.360
This court this election takes place after a preliminary pushing back and forth

194
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.540
in the year 5 0 8 7

195
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:20.190
and his victory means a victory for the reactionary program and one of his first

196
00:16:23.081 --> 00:16:28.081
actions is to establish still another council not the Council of 400 that so

197
00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:37.980
long had established but a new council of 300 and it was to be made up only of

198
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.930
aristocrats second.

199
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:48.300
Very interesting and it turns out very important change introduced by ISAC which

200
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:56.280
was to scrutinise the citizens list and then to remove from that list.

201
00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:01.660
Lots and lots of people who were deemed to be.

202
00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.390
I guess to say illegally enrolled in the citizen list.

203
00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:12.440
They were now going to impose retroactively the traditional criterion for

204
00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:17.660
Athenian citizenship is your father an Athenian citizen.

205
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:23.070
But we know that Solon had already broken through that by permitting people to

206
00:17:24.851 --> 00:17:29.680
come to Athens and to acquire citizenship if they had the necessary skills.

207
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.680
And there surely had been a fair number of those.

208
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:38.100
And we are told that the PI system heads had done the same thing for pretty much

209
00:17:39.281 --> 00:17:40.150
the same reason.

210
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:45.370
So over a couple of generations you had foreigners coming to Athens and

211
00:17:45.371 --> 00:17:50.371
acquiring Athenian citizenship and undoubtedly using it who are now going to be

212
00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:57.850
disenfranchised and driven from the citizen lists.

213
00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:04.380
Now that made for quite a few discontented people in Athens if you if you picked

214
00:18:06.871 --> 00:18:11.871
a moment after which I sacrifice has accomplished these two things.

215
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:17.240
That is establishing the Council of 300 which is obviously going to be the

216
00:18:17.241 --> 00:18:22.241
governing body in Athens and aristocratic council and driven X number of people

217
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.840
from the citizen lists.

218
00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:32.260
Then all of those people are going to be very unhappy and very likely they have

219
00:18:32.811 --> 00:18:35.990
friends who are also going to be unhappy.

220
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:41.320
So you have a situation which is by no means calm and subtle but it might have

221
00:18:43.461 --> 00:18:48.461
settled down as people as they usually do when things are unavoidable when there

222
00:18:49.971 --> 00:18:53.000
is no real option.
Nobody is making a different case.

223
00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:57.920
They would have just gotten used to things I suppose but now Clyde Sinise

224
00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.290
decides to do things differently.

225
00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:05.320
He does not accept his defeat as he would have had to do in the old days having

226
00:19:06.561 --> 00:19:11.561
been defeated in the aristocratic contest instead in the words of Herodotus

227
00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.000
prose that reads it I tongue.

228
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:22.400
<v 6>Damon He brought the people into his political faction the root of that first</v>

229
00:19:26.211 --> 00:19:31.211
word processor reads a tie his head tie Rhea which means a club a political club

230
00:19:32.961 --> 00:19:34.610
a collection of companions.

231
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:39.860
That's the name for these aristocratic societies and and Kleist and these broke

232
00:19:39.861 --> 00:19:40.580
the rules.

233
00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:44.710
He went out there beyond the aristocratic circle and he recruited people you'll

234
00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.620
become part of my political faction.
Well why should they.

235
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:54.940
Because he had a program that was contrary to the one pursued by high salaries.

236
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:04.720
It's one that will result when it is successful in the establishment of what

237
00:20:05.811 --> 00:20:10.811
pretty much everybody agrees was the first Athenian democracy.

238
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:18.100
<v 5>The reforms that he proposed then we have we have to imagine he actually went</v>

239
00:20:18.711 --> 00:20:23.711
around an election year that was not done before that and persuaded people to

240
00:20:25.371 --> 00:20:30.371
support him in his programs and then he put his programs through.

241
00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.390
Well where did he put these programs through.

242
00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:39.290
He surely couldn't have done that in the Council of 300 it would never have

243
00:20:39.291 --> 00:20:41.330
passed any.
I'm sure you didn't try.

244
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:46.260
Instead he acted I think as though there was no council of 300.

245
00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:51.260
He did what you would have done if you wanted to propose a bill prior to that

246
00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:56.530
you would go you would go to the assembly which was the slowness in assembly and

247
00:20:57.441 --> 00:21:00.360
which had the right to pass laws no doubt.

248
00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:04.520
It only passed laws that the price district is wanted but it was not something

249
00:21:04.521 --> 00:21:07.190
new.
It was something people were accustomed to.

250
00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:11.420
And he went to the Assembly and he proposed his laws and they were passed.

251
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:16.160
Well I Sacker was still had the whip hand and he wasn't going to sit still while

252
00:21:16.161 --> 00:21:16.994
that took place.

253
00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:22.300
And so using the force at his disposal he drove clear.

254
00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:23.820
I'm sorry.

255
00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:28.310
It's matter of fact the force that I was at was at his disposal was that of

256
00:21:28.311 --> 00:21:32.040
tinkling nominees and the Spartans who came back again when called back.

257
00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:37.640
No doubt what Clemens had in mind when he did what he had done originally

258
00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:42.560
driving out the price district it was the establishment of an aristocratic

259
00:21:42.561 --> 00:21:46.070
republic in Athens with his friends being in charge.

260
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:49.850
<v 9>That's what the Spartans typically would do if they could.</v>

261
00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.910
So he was shocked and annoyed.

262
00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:57.940
I'm certain when he hears his friends have been somehow pushed out of power and

263
00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:03.220
some new fangled kind of a government that lets ordinary people participate has

264
00:22:03.621 --> 00:22:04.500
been instituted.

265
00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:10.040
So calamities comes back with his forces and drives Kleist and his and we are

266
00:22:10.041 --> 00:22:11.630
told this is interesting figure.

267
00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:16.720
<v 6>I can't promise that it's right but it does show up in Athens and Herodotus</v>

268
00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:23.550
licenses and seven hundred families who must have been in his faction are driven

269
00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.580
out of Abbot out of out of Attica.

270
00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.900
But the people are not ready to take that.

271
00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:38.620
<v 9>They resist and they have numbers on their side and they end up shutting up clay</v>

272
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:44.930
hominids and his forces which are not many.

273
00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:48.920
<v 5>We're talking about probably hundreds of soldiers no more than that.</v>

274
00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:53.930
And we must imagine that there are thousands of Athenians out there who are

275
00:22:53.931 --> 00:22:54.764
discontent.

276
00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:59.900
So they shut Clay nominees up on the Acropolis where he has run for safety with

277
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:01.550
salaries at his side.

278
00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:06.970
<v 6>And finally they cut a deal and they go home and Kleist and his and his</v>

279
00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:14.170
supporters who it's fair I think to start calling Democrats have taken over the

280
00:23:15.201 --> 00:23:20.201
city by this coup and are ready to go forward now this requires that they

281
00:23:23.511 --> 00:23:28.511
establish a new constitution because they're going to have a regime the likes of

282
00:23:28.521 --> 00:23:30.800
which no one had ever seen before.

283
00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:36.020
<v 5>But in trying to understand this constitution and it's not easy.</v>

284
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:41.150
The ancient sources tell us a lot about it but it's not perfectly clear what's

285
00:23:41.151 --> 00:23:44.280
in everybody's mind as they do what they do.

286
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.600
Motives purposes are not clear as you'll see in a moment.

287
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.710
<v 8>But anyway what I want you to a fix on is this.</v>

288
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.660
Don't imagine that what's taking place here is even anything like the American

289
00:23:56.661 --> 00:24:01.661
Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia where a bunch of delegates have been

290
00:24:02.331 --> 00:24:05.780
selected from here and there and they all sit and argue with each other over the

291
00:24:05.781 --> 00:24:09.590
hot summer and finally come up with various plans.

292
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:14.980
It's better I think to think we're using historical analogies to help us as of

293
00:24:15.021 --> 00:24:17.960
course there is nothing better than that to help us.

294
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:22.190
Think of the French Revolution.

295
00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:28.150
Think of the convention where the sort of the mass of the people have gained

296
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:34.420
control of the situation after driving the king from his throne and after really

297
00:24:35.961 --> 00:24:40.961
putting aside a more aristocratic council that came before it and they sit down

298
00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:45.680
with radical people running around ready to kill people.

299
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:51.430
<v 6>This is the outfit that's going to end up killing the King and his queen and all</v>

300
00:24:51.831 --> 00:24:53.660
the aristocrats they can lay their hands on.

301
00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:59.170
In other words we are in a revolutionary situation and their force and terror.

302
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:09.610
Are in the air and everybody is fully aware of the danger of this that and the

303
00:25:11.631 --> 00:25:15.530
other thing and of some dangers that probably don't even exist.

304
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:21.070
We are in a situation that resembles civil war that could be on the brink of a

305
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:24.770
serious civil war.
And added to that.

306
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:29.780
In other words the Athenians who are who will be sitting in the assembly passing

307
00:25:29.781 --> 00:25:34.781
the laws that produce the Constitution that Kleist in these favors are first of

308
00:25:35.361 --> 00:25:40.361
all already afraid that the local aristocrats will use force or guile against

309
00:25:43.281 --> 00:25:44.030
them.

310
00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:49.030
But on top of that there's been two Spartan invasions of Attica in the last

311
00:25:49.551 --> 00:25:53.250
couple of years and this is nothing to stop.

312
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:57.410
<v 9>King Clay nominees from coming back again because he doesn't like the way he's</v>

313
00:25:57.411 --> 00:25:58.244
been treated.

314
00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:03.230
In fact I'd go further I'd say there's every reason to fear that that's going to

315
00:26:03.231 --> 00:26:04.360
happen again.

316
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.840
That's where the analogy to the French Revolution works again because nothing

317
00:26:08.841 --> 00:26:13.841
that happens in that the most radical period of the French Revolution is

318
00:26:13.971 --> 00:26:18.890
understandable if you don't know that the French regularly expect that the kings

319
00:26:18.891 --> 00:26:23.540
and emperors of Europe will be marching against them with professional armies

320
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:28.690
very soon and their fear is absolutely justified and so is the Athenian fear

321
00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:30.320
that the Spartans will be coming.

322
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:35.920
<v 6>So it's in that hot environment where fear is all over the place that this new</v>

323
00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:43.070
democratic constitution will be shaped

324
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.880
and there's no question that I think that the place where it's happening is in

325
00:26:49.921 --> 00:26:50.790
the Assembly.

326
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:56.600
The Assembly sits as you I hope you know on a hillside in the middle of Athens

327
00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:03.620
on a hill called the panics and there in the open air all adult male citizens

328
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:10.170
are eligible to participate in what takes place.

329
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:16.670
One little point I also suggest to you is what about the people who have been

330
00:27:17.191 --> 00:27:22.080
thrown off the citizen lists.
Are they there.
My No.

331
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.990
This is just reasoning I don't we don't have any hard evidence.

332
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:28.380
My my my answer is absolutely they are.

333
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:33.360
Who is going to tell them not to you show up on the Hill.

334
00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:38.580
Who's going to kick you off.
This Kleist Dems want you kicked out.
Hell no.

335
00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:43.910
Because as we will see one of his main planks is enrolling those people as

336
00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:45.443
citizens.

337
00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:49.800
<v 9>So in fact I will bet a lot of money that in all the electioneering that went on</v>

338
00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:53.680
about all these different things they were a group he must have targeted and say

339
00:27:53.681 --> 00:27:57.000
you you've been unfairly treated by these aristocrats.

340
00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:01.530
If I get in power I will see to it that you are enrolled again as citizens.

341
00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:06.700
So all of that is happening and people are very excited about what is going on.

342
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:12.420
That's the background for these rather dry and puzzling details I am about to

343
00:28:12.421 --> 00:28:17.421
lay on you to try to describe what this new what these new laws were that

344
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.880
amounted to some kind of a democracy.

345
00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:27.270
At the center of them apparently were reforms of the tribes and they are in some

346
00:28:30.841 --> 00:28:35.490
ways very radical indeed.
As you note these tribes go back.

347
00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.130
Before the birth of history.

348
00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:43.020
Think of any primitive society you want to it's likely to be divided up into

349
00:28:43.021 --> 00:28:48.021
tribes the tribes typically are alleged to come from some very ancient times

350
00:28:48.751 --> 00:28:51.150
when gods or heroes founded them.

351
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:56.160
That's certainly true of the Greek tribes where each tribe is named after some

352
00:28:56.670 --> 00:29:00.660
heroic figure or some semi divine figure in the past.

353
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:06.080
So there are for the four traditional Ionian tribes and that's why this what

354
00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:10.320
makes it even more radical than anything else is that class in these law.

355
00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:16.580
Changes the tribal system in Athens from four tribes to ten tribes absolutely

356
00:29:19.651 --> 00:29:22.410
brand new things that have no tradition behind them nothing.

357
00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:27.770
No history or anything and then he has to give names to these tribes and

358
00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:33.650
according to the Greek practice these tribes have to have some founding hero to

359
00:29:34.501 --> 00:29:37.710
be named after so he gets picks out.

360
00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:43.250
I think I'm right in thinking 100 names of heroes and he assigns them to the ten

361
00:29:44.461 --> 00:29:49.461
tribes by lot and now we suddenly have ten new tribes now.

362
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.070
I mean if you trick and try to think yourself back.

363
00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:57.520
To tribal society and think What a what a disruptive thing this is all my life

364
00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.900
I've been a member of the tribe named after iron.

365
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:06.770
And some of my ancestors and so my answer no more.
He's not around anymore.

366
00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:10.400
There's a new tribe that was just invented that I'm a member of.

367
00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:16.180
So that's a very surprising thing but that's not the end of the story.

368
00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:22.570
<v 6>Each tribe now is divided up into three parts.</v>

369
00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:29.200
They the word for a third is treatise and the plural is treatise.

370
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:32.000
And here's the point.

371
00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:37.150
Each one of each tribe has one of its treaty ace in and around the city of

372
00:30:42.841 --> 00:30:43.674
Athens.

373
00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:49.700
<v 10>It has another one in the middle of Athens.</v>

374
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:57.480
And I'm sorry in the middle of Attica and in the third it is the third of its

375
00:30:58.531 --> 00:31:03.531
three regions sorry of its of its three divisions will be in the region called

376
00:31:04.681 --> 00:31:07.320
the coast that Kerala.

377
00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:13.820
<v 6>So every tribe is geographically distributed across all of Africa in this way.</v>

378
00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.680
That is something quite new in the old days.

379
00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:25.040
We have to believe that the tribes were geographically separated for regions for

380
00:31:27.031 --> 00:31:27.864
tribes.

381
00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:36.270
<v 5>Yeah.
The Sydney region the Coast region and the Midland Region.</v>

382
00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:42.170
<v 6>Each one of these regions has 10 treaties one for each of the 10 tribes.</v>

383
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:46.840
Now let's take it a step further.

384
00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:53.040
The treaties themselves are formed of units that are called deems in English.

385
00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:57.730
That's DTM yes the Greek word for it.

386
00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:03.220
Very confusing is de MOS now the day MOS is this deemed this political unit.

387
00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:08.380
It also means a village.

388
00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:12.250
It also means the whole Athenian people.

389
00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:15.550
And it also means only the poor Athenian people.

390
00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.330
So there you are.

391
00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:23.720
But in the context that we're dealing with it here we mean these units that are

392
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:28.800
geographical and have a constitutional function.

393
00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:33.450
There is however even here there's a certain amount of.

394
00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:39.830
<v 4>Confusion because some of the deems are actually made up of an original village.</v>

395
00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:45.550
They don't mess with that.
Diem is the equivalent of.

396
00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:49.370
In other words a Diem is a dean the two different meanings of the word.

397
00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:54.440
The other deems for the constitutional purpose are made up of a number of

398
00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:56.913
villages.

399
00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:01.990
So there would be a lot of these old deans placed into the new constitutional

400
00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:03.130
deal.

401
00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:08.130
The idea however is that every treatise must be of the same size in terms of

402
00:33:10.421 --> 00:33:15.421
population because they have your whole idea is to get each tribe to be

403
00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:21.400
numerically equal and that's one reason for that is because the tribes will be

404
00:33:21.401 --> 00:33:26.080
the regiments of the Athenian army.
You line up and fight in.

405
00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:31.150
When that when you're call to fight in the Army in your accordance with your

406
00:33:31.151 --> 00:33:35.230
Diem which is located in a certain tradition which is becomes a regiment of your

407
00:33:35.231 --> 00:33:39.480
tribe as a regiment of the army now.

408
00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:45.440
<v 6>They get to straighten out the deems are unequal in population but the trivia</v>

409
00:33:47.141 --> 00:33:48.630
Ace has to be equal.

410
00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:53.370
So that tells you you have to have multiple teams in some and just one or two or

411
00:33:53.371 --> 00:33:55.230
not or a few in another.

412
00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.233
<v 11>All right.</v>

413
00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:11.820
<v 10>It is also true that the treaties are assigned to the tribes by lot.</v>

414
00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:18.600
And the thing I want you to remember I want to avoid as much complication as I

415
00:34:18.601 --> 00:34:23.601
can is that it doesn't really matter to the people who invented the Constitution

416
00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:31.040
how the Diems are assigned to the treaties except one scholar has suggested one

417
00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:39.630
motive that strikes most of us as very plausible made a careful study of how the

418
00:34:40.901 --> 00:34:43.060
themes are distributed to the treaties

419
00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:49.770
and compared them with where we know there were important religious sites.

420
00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:56.880
You know the Greek religion has these many gods and deities and they have local

421
00:34:57.221 --> 00:35:02.221
characteristics because there are legends about their having lit on this earth

422
00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:06.970
at a certain place or done a deed at another place.

423
00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:12.240
So you have a cave of hand in eastern Attica and you have a place where Athena

424
00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:15.860
did this that and the other thing.

425
00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:21.540
And the point I'm getting at is these became shrines places where the religion

426
00:35:22.571 --> 00:35:27.571
was exercised and in ancient Attica aristocratic Attica the aristocrats owned a

427
00:35:29.201 --> 00:35:32.920
piece of land on which the shrine was which meant you had to have their

428
00:35:32.921 --> 00:35:36.700
permission to come onto it to worship which meant that they would have

429
00:35:36.701 --> 00:35:39.640
predominance power and influence in these areas.

430
00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.850
Well what does scholar David Lewis was his name.

431
00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:49.290
Concluded was that there are times when there are quite a few times when the

432
00:35:50.351 --> 00:35:55.351
thing is laid out in such a way as to decide the divide.

433
00:35:55.630 --> 00:36:00.280
The religious site on the aristocrats.

434
00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:05.890
Land.
From his main dwelling on that land.

435
00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:11.460
So the aristocrat is separated from the place where he has religious clout as a

436
00:36:13.301 --> 00:36:16.720
way of dividing up his political influence and power.

437
00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:22.140
He reads this as a one of the ways in which class Sunnis attempted to diminish

438
00:36:22.841 --> 00:36:27.841
the power of the aristocracy through its local influence.

439
00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:33.490
<v 6>Now this new deem is very very important.</v>

440
00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:39.580
It is the basic unit in the whole system it takes.

441
00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:44.240
It was meant I should say to take the place of the frat tree.

442
00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:48.680
You remember the Brotherhood that was the kernel of the old tribal system.

443
00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:53.300
It was meant that the frat tree that the Dean should be the basic thing for

444
00:36:53.301 --> 00:36:54.134
instance

445
00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
one of the most important things was that your citizenship according to the laws

446
00:37:01.101 --> 00:37:06.101
of class and these were no longer was no longer to be ascertained by going to

447
00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:07.424
your frat tree.

448
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:13.150
But each Dean would keep an official role of the citizens in that deed.

449
00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:19.330
So when an Athenian boy is born and when he reaches a certain age you have to

450
00:37:22.041 --> 00:37:26.030
take him to the Diem and register him and now he can be an Athenian citizen.

451
00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:31.780
Well this was one of several things that we see in Christ in his constitution

452
00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:34.453
that.

453
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:39.110
In which the intention could not be carried out.

454
00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:44.170
That is the flattery and the notion of the flattery as the core of such things

455
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:49.990
was never abolished would have been out out out of the question to abolish it

456
00:37:50.581 --> 00:37:55.581
that too many religious associations and it never really lost its place in the

457
00:37:55.641 --> 00:37:56.720
Athenian mind.

458
00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:01.780
Yes your official enrollment as a citizen was in the dream but there was still a

459
00:38:01.851 --> 00:38:04.530
tremendous allegiance to the flattery.

460
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
So it didn't have its end and the factory was still run by aristocrats so it

461
00:38:10.311 --> 00:38:12.590
didn't have its full effect

462
00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:19.290
the Diem elected an official called a D Mark.

463
00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:24.860
We could might call a mayor or whatever the local official is called selectmen.

464
00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:29.930
We say sometimes still in Connecticut holding to our colonial traditions.

465
00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:37.680
And the demon is also given religious functions and religious rights because

466
00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:41.760
everybody knows that religion still is potent.

467
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:46.830
Even if you're engaged in a revolution in Athens at the beginning of the fifth

468
00:38:46.831 --> 00:38:47.664
century

469
00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:54.340
here's another thing that they tried to do.

470
00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:59.970
<v 12>Kaizen is tried with a law to change the way in which an Athenian was officially</v>

471
00:39:00.971 --> 00:39:05.260
designated.
It used to be before classes came along.

472
00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.360
You ask a man who are you.

473
00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:12.690
He would say I am Kleist and he's the son of mega Cleese period.

474
00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:17.810
Just the petro Nemec just like you know

475
00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:23.980
you have you bear the name of your father unless you chose to bear the name of

476
00:39:23.981 --> 00:39:27.580
your mother which is evidence of how on the theman we really are.

477
00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.010
<v 6>So that's the way it was.</v>

478
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:38.040
But under the laws of Christ and His henceforth citizens were to be designated

479
00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:43.680
not as Christ in the son of mega Cleaves but as Kleist Denise from Alo picky

480
00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:52.440
which is to say his Diem he was to be the citizen's name and his Diem name it

481
00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:54.453
was a direct

482
00:39:56.230 --> 00:40:01.230
people have argued about what the point of all this was but I think one limited

483
00:40:02.201 --> 00:40:07.201
point before we get to the full story is simply another way of cutting down the

484
00:40:08.201 --> 00:40:13.201
influence of birth in this society as a way of damaging the aristocratic

485
00:40:13.631 --> 00:40:18.400
principle and asserting in its place look what's really happening here that

486
00:40:18.401 --> 00:40:23.401
there is something which is the poles that has nothing to do with birth that is

487
00:40:23.591 --> 00:40:28.591
the part of the legal structure which is a pole is it's a whole new concept

488
00:40:30.011 --> 00:40:35.011
that's really creeping in here replacing the old traditional way of organizing

489
00:40:35.651 --> 00:40:40.651
society with one that is the work of citizens coming together and determining

490
00:40:41.741 --> 00:40:44.110
how they themselves will be governed.

491
00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:52.060
<v 13>All right let that be the story of the tribes for a moment now.</v>

492
00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:57.980
Here we go with another council.
You've heard about the Council of 400.

493
00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:02.150
You've heard about the Council of 300.
We can do better than that.

494
00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:04.120
We can have a council of five hundred.

495
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:10.990
<v 6>It will be the council that is the Democratic Council for the remainder of the</v>

496
00:41:11.541 --> 00:41:15.950
history of the Athenian democracy with the exception of short periods of

497
00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:22.330
oligarchic rebellion that remove it but it comes back when the democracy does

498
00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.620
and that council let me simply describe it very briefly.

499
00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:32.360
It is open to all Athenian adult male citizens.

500
00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:38.860
Membership on the council comes through some combination of allotment and

501
00:41:42.471 --> 00:41:45.410
election.
The

502
00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:54.720
point that the point of it is that an assembly of thousands is not well-equipped

503
00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:01.730
to conduct all kinds of business that has to be conducted for the state and even

504
00:42:01.731 --> 00:42:02.564
its own business.

505
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:07.990
You need a small group to prepare the agenda for a full assembly meeting and so

506
00:42:10.341 --> 00:42:13.840
that was the function of the 500.

507
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:19.330
It is and this is very important one of those very democratic elements in the

508
00:42:19.911 --> 00:42:24.260
assembly of course is totally democratic because all adult male citizens

509
00:42:24.261 --> 00:42:25.490
participate if they wish.

510
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:31.930
But you can easily get around that in some degree if you have a counselor little

511
00:42:32.811 --> 00:42:36.680
group that actually determines what's going to happen from the first.

512
00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:41.920
It wasn't so the the members of the council had to be

513
00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:49.660
I'm sorry the council itself was as democratic as the assembly and so we'll come

514
00:42:52.881 --> 00:42:55.460
back to that council later on but there it is in place.

515
00:42:56.390 --> 00:43:00.500
<v 5>Another thing that happened not in 5 0 8 7 but a few years down the road but</v>

516
00:43:00.501 --> 00:43:05.501
still in this same period was that by now the army of Athens which originally

517
00:43:08.871 --> 00:43:11.660
had been led simply by the Parliament.

518
00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:16.960
The icon who was chosen for the military leadership he had given way to generals

519
00:43:17.721 --> 00:43:19.870
who commanded the different tribes.

520
00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:25.130
<v 6>And it used to be that each tribe elected its own general.</v>

521
00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:30.700
But in the new system now each tribe sorry back up.

522
00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:35.870
The entire people elected the generals for each of the tribes.

523
00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:39.950
In other words the ten tribes still had a general apiece but the entire

524
00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:44.120
population elected him usually play.

525
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:49.270
He came from the tribe that he was asked to command but not always.

526
00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.830
And again this you can see what the point of this is.

527
00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:58.310
It has the same characteristic as so much of what we are describing it is going

528
00:43:58.441 --> 00:44:03.441
to reduce this particular schism localism and make the whole people the whole

529
00:44:06.321 --> 00:44:11.321
demos and their representative institutions be the decisive element in the state

530
00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.760
and that is one of the things as well we'll be getting to right next to ask

531
00:44:16.761 --> 00:44:19.850
ourselves what's going on here and why is it happening.

532
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:23.460
And here's where our sources.

533
00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:27.630
I'll tell you what our sources say and that's the end of the day we have to make

534
00:44:27.631 --> 00:44:29.560
some judgments of course.

535
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:35.510
Generally and I think properly the source get who gets the most credence from

536
00:44:36.391 --> 00:44:41.391
scholars today is Herodotus who's closer to it in time than although he's

537
00:44:42.421 --> 00:44:42.780
buying.

538
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:47.070
You know I should point out here right if this is writing his history some time

539
00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:52.130
or at least he's writing it as late as the four twenties but he himself goes

540
00:44:53.401 --> 00:44:58.401
back to an earlier part of the 5th century and therefore he is in a position to

541
00:45:00.511 --> 00:45:05.511
hear stories from people who go back even into the 6th century which makes him

542
00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:09.840
theoretically a more credible source than people like Aristotle who I'll be

543
00:45:09.841 --> 00:45:14.841
quoting at you who lives in the 4th century and has a good hold century later

544
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:16.950
than Herodotus.

545
00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:22.610
But Herodotus is not of course himself a witness to any of the facts that he

546
00:45:23.491 --> 00:45:28.491
abuses anyway he asks Why did Clay cities of Athens do what he did.

547
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:32.010
And his answer is a pretty stale one.

548
00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:37.820
He was trying to copy his ancestor Kleist the knees of sticking on who also

549
00:45:39.241 --> 00:45:40.470
changed the tribes.

550
00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:45.500
You may remember in second from the old Dorian tribes two new tribes that

551
00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:52.940
designated the wrong people like I mean to say the Dorian's as swine men and

552
00:45:53.011 --> 00:45:54.180
asked men and so on.

553
00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:00.420
And that that's why closely is that any sort of be a nice thing to do because

554
00:46:00.421 --> 00:46:04.950
his ancestors namesake did the same thing.
Well I don't think we can buy that.

555
00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:08.440
We move into a more persuasive territory.

556
00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:13.500
I think when we get to Aristotle who writes in his politics as follows perhaps a

557
00:46:15.421 --> 00:46:17.490
question rather arises.

558
00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:21.720
<v 10>He's dealing with the whole question of citizenship about those who had been</v>

559
00:46:21.721 --> 00:46:26.721
admitted to citizenship after a revolution had taken place for instance such a

560
00:46:28.401 --> 00:46:33.401
creation of citizens as that carried out at Athens by Kleist Denise after the

561
00:46:34.521 --> 00:46:39.521
expulsion of the tyrants when he enrolled in his tribes many resident aliens

562
00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:47.840
medics who had been foreigners and slaves.

563
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:50.960
So here's a new story we have to add to the picture.

564
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:53.570
I mentioned it in passing but it's very important.

565
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:58.690
One of the things class this does and he has to do it through measures passed

566
00:46:58.691 --> 00:47:03.691
through the assembly is to enfranchise the people who had been thrown off the

567
00:47:04.101 --> 00:47:05.450
citizen lists.

568
00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:11.540
And one thing that you want to do.

569
00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:16.960
You couldn't have done that given the nature of the old constitution if you

570
00:47:17.451 --> 00:47:22.451
hadn't broken up the old system of tribes fruit trees and so on and come up with

571
00:47:23.241 --> 00:47:26.990
a new one which would not have the old prejudices against it.

572
00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:28.460
So that's part of the story.

573
00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:34.010
Again Aristotle or one of his pupils there's some dispute about the document

574
00:47:34.011 --> 00:47:36.070
that is called Athenian pull a tail.

575
00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:41.500
Constitution of Athens as to whether Aristotle was the composer of that piece or

576
00:47:42.501 --> 00:47:46.250
one of his students.
Anyway here's what it says.

577
00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:51.280
What the aim of mixing up the population so that a great number would share in

578
00:47:52.941 --> 00:47:57.941
the citizenship they came up with this phrase may follow Cree name do not judge

579
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:06.120
according to tribe.

580
00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:12.080
<v 13>But it goes beyond tribe it merely means do not judge on the basis of birth.</v>

581
00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:19.770
Aristotle says it was directed against those who wanted to check on family

582
00:48:20.251 --> 00:48:21.210
backgrounds.

583
00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:27.280
<v 6>He goes on to say this new nomenclature that's what I just mentioned to you</v>

584
00:48:27.281 --> 00:48:32.280
before about your name is now no longer the son of you.

585
00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:35.420
You are the son of a so and so but rather you are of the Dean.

586
00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:39.730
So and so he says so that they would not by addressing one another by their

587
00:48:39.731 --> 00:48:44.731
fathers names expose the newly enrolled citizens but would call them by the

588
00:48:45.881 --> 00:48:47.870
families of the D.

589
00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:53.380
This passage caused a great deal of puzzle and confusion among scholars who

590
00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:55.780
couldn't understand what this is all about.

591
00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:01.440
And that's I think because the topic was mostly treated by by the British but

592
00:49:01.901 --> 00:49:03.610
Americans can see this right away.

593
00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:08.110
If you were the best way to put it this way of course you wouldn't know about

594
00:49:08.111 --> 00:49:08.290
this.

595
00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:13.290
You live in a country with absolutely pure and without prejudice according to

596
00:49:13.481 --> 00:49:16.960
race or color or ethnic origins or religion.

597
00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:21.250
So you won't know what I'm talking about but let me pass on from an earlier

598
00:49:21.251 --> 00:49:25.300
generation a darker time in which I grew up in which.

599
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:32.710
<v 12>Supposing you were a man who came from the RNC in Italy and your name was</v>

600
00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:41.130
Giovanni DiStefano that was fighting in the Abruzzo but in America there were

601
00:49:44.201 --> 00:49:48.280
people who didn't have a high opinion of people with such a name and were likely

602
00:49:48.281 --> 00:49:53.020
not to be opening their doors or homes to people like that.

603
00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:58.470
And so your son instead of calling himself.

604
00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:04.040
<v 14>Giovanni DiStefano changed his name to John Stevens</v>

605
00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:08.310
and thereupon everything was OK.

606
00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:13.610
<v 15>That's the way things were meant to be in Athens.</v>

607
00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:18.710
<v 5>That is to say the idea was if you had a foreign sounding name your father would</v>

608
00:50:19.021 --> 00:50:20.170
have a foreign sounding name.

609
00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:24.390
<v 8>If he came from a foreign place when he settled in Attica you would be branded</v>

610
00:50:24.391 --> 00:50:25.224
in that way.

611
00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:29.550
And people who wanted and here it was more specific who people who at some time

612
00:50:29.551 --> 00:50:32.880
I want to throw you off the citizenships lists would know who you were.

613
00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:38.420
But if you took a good solid Anglo Athenian name why you'd be all right.

614
00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:44.630
<v 10>So I think that is the explanation and it's all part of the same picture taking</v>

615
00:50:46.121 --> 00:50:51.121
away the traditional influences that would be an anti-democratic and replacing

616
00:50:51.611 --> 00:50:56.611
them with things that shatter that and taking away the local powers.

617
00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:03.770
Anything that smacked of the past.
You try to a race as best you can.

618
00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:08.160
<v 6>The procedure.</v>

619
00:51:08.650 --> 00:51:13.650
We all agree is by the device that the Greeks called Safe is mine.

620
00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:21.270
It was a motion passed by the Assembly and it comes to be the standard form of

621
00:51:24.481 --> 00:51:27.150
legislation in the Athenian democracy.

622
00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:30.260
The plural of safe is my is safest my top.

623
00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:35.160
Now the scholar who I was alluding to a few moments ago.

624
00:51:36.450 --> 00:51:39.930
LEWIS He's got the general picture right.

625
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:43.860
He says we have to understand all of this was passed on the assembly and a mood

626
00:51:43.861 --> 00:51:46.530
of great excitement and fear and anger.

627
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:52.910
A revolutionary situation in which he imagined alluding to the revolution in St.

628
00:51:55.861 --> 00:52:00.861
Petersburg in 1917 that they are getting up and shouting all power to the ten

629
00:52:03.091 --> 00:52:06.270
tribes.
To those of you who are not in St.

630
00:52:06.271 --> 00:52:09.540
Petersburg but they were shouting was all power to the Soviets.

631
00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:11.910
But I think he's wrong.

632
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:16.590
It wasn't about the ten tribes the ten tribes weren't the issue.

633
00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:21.150
I think if they were shouting and I guess they were they were shouting all power

634
00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:23.050
to the clay C.R.

635
00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:28.790
to the assembly that's where decisions were going to be made in the future.

636
00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:35.420
But I do want you to take seriously the notion of the making such a claim and

637
00:52:35.701 --> 00:52:40.701
doing so in heated circumstances that are revolutionary because without that

638
00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:45.480
it's inconceivable that what happened would have happened.

639
00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:47.950
Now let me go back to the bullet.

640
00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:55.140
It was elected by lot from proportional representation in the deans all of the

641
00:52:56.201 --> 00:52:57.034
unions.

642
00:52:57.850 --> 00:53:02.850
Greek word for preparing legislation for an assembly is pro Boone loosest and

643
00:53:03.151 --> 00:53:05.860
such a group is called Pro Bowl Lutnick.

644
00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:08.820
That is it prepares legislation

645
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:15.470
the chances are that this council was more powerful and had more independence

646
00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:21.930
when it was invented than it would later on.

647
00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:24.240
That's just a guess.

648
00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:28.770
But you know you at the beginning of something there's still you're still living

649
00:53:28.771 --> 00:53:33.771
in a society in which class distinctions are very clear and very sharp in which

650
00:53:35.551 --> 00:53:40.551
the idea of the ordinary citizen taking things into his own hands is new and

651
00:53:40.891 --> 00:53:41.724
scary.

652
00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:47.480
I think that would have been a lot of deference paid to the individuals who came

653
00:53:47.641 --> 00:53:51.240
from the higher classes and I would guess that they would have been on the list

654
00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:56.540
preliminary list that that was elected before allotment selected among them.

655
00:53:57.510 --> 00:54:02.510
And that when they proposed something to the assembly it would be given greater

656
00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:11.220
sort of greater influence on what happened subsequently than would be true when

657
00:54:11.221 --> 00:54:14.460
we get down to the full scale Athenian democracy in the time of Pericles.

658
00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:19.230
Forget about it.
The bully is the servant of the assembly.

659
00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:24.290
Without question the assembly can if if the if the council sends in a proposed

660
00:54:25.861 --> 00:54:30.861
law and certain language the assembly can vote it down or they can send it back

661
00:54:31.261 --> 00:54:35.160
to the bully and say no we don't like those words change the words into this

662
00:54:35.161 --> 00:54:39.120
direction and send it back to us.
That's the way it was in the full democracy.

663
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:42.990
My guess is it wasn't that way in the year five or five.

664
00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:48.440
<v 14>I think it probably was meant by Kleist and these to be a bit more conservative</v>

665
00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:54.240
without being of course in any way reactionary.

666
00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:03.120
<v 6>Now what is this all about in the largest sense</v>

667
00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:10.460
Lewis suggests that there's something here that is personal and political and I

668
00:55:10.591 --> 00:55:11.490
think he's right.

669
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:17.000
One of the elements that he suggests is these dreams were not assigned to

670
00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:23.790
treaties accidentally as I've suggested already but were carefully laid out not

671
00:55:24.991 --> 00:55:29.991
only to deprive noblemen of their undue influence but he thinks probably to help

672
00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:37.910
close the knees and his alchemy on the die to have a powerful voice and as much

673
00:55:38.821 --> 00:55:40.800
of Attica as he possibly could.

674
00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:44.220
Why in the world would anybody doubt that.

675
00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:48.990
That strikes me as being so I mean that's what people do when they have the

676
00:55:48.991 --> 00:55:51.750
power to help themselves politically they do.

677
00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:56.610
I would guess in other words Kleist in was thinking of his own political

678
00:55:56.611 --> 00:55:58.080
position in part.

679
00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:02.580
We don't have hard evidence for this but just a reasonable suggestion.

680
00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:08.820
Now the other thing is we have to we have to I think believe that the this whole

681
00:56:10.991 --> 00:56:15.991
program of reform was supported by what we have been referring to all along the

682
00:56:17.141 --> 00:56:18.220
hop like class.

683
00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:23.580
These independent farmers they are the ones who are most numerous.

684
00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:25.960
They are.

685
00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:30.960
I mean among those who will be politically active also they are of course the

686
00:56:31.181 --> 00:56:33.290
defense of Athens.

687
00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:38.370
Now they have to be taken very seriously and they are not about to allow

688
00:56:39.431 --> 00:56:40.930
themselves to be cut out.

689
00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:46.680
Or to have their own influence diminished by things that are hanging over from

690
00:56:47.681 --> 00:56:49.270
the days of aristocracy.

691
00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:53.720
And so I think we should think of this most scholars.

692
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:56.030
I think just about everybody does this.

693
00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:59.190
They like to designate this place authentic democracy.

694
00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:04.220
This first democracy as a hop light democracy and saying that the hot lights are

695
00:57:06.201 --> 00:57:11.201
in means that to some considerable degree the poor are out.

696
00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:14.700
The chances are very great.

697
00:57:14.730 --> 00:57:18.000
I would say pretty certain that.

698
00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:21.930
The majority of citizens.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

699
00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:26.690
Majority of Athenian citizens were not hotlines.

700
00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:28.530
<v 12>They were thieves</v>

701
00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:35.550
it probably never was a time when the hot lights were a majority even in Athens

702
00:57:38.070 --> 00:57:43.070
so excluding them certainly is a limit on what you want to call democracy.

703
00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:48.150
And here's where we get into sort of the debates these days.

704
00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:51.290
Many many the scholar now that the.

705
00:57:52.110 --> 00:57:56.880
The academy is essentially a branch of the Politburo

706
00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:04.080
will want to denigrate ancient Athenian democracy and to suggest it really

707
00:58:05.321 --> 00:58:07.720
wasn't democratic.
Well 20 million ways you can do that.

708
00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:11.380
<v 14>You can talk about the fact that it excluded women you can talk about the fact</v>

709
00:58:11.381 --> 00:58:12.214
that it

710
00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:17.110
who else is it excluded slate.

711
00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:20.480
<v 16>That it had slaves excluded slaves it excluded resident aliens.</v>

712
00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:25.670
And all those things and then you can finally point to the fact that probably

713
00:58:25.671 --> 00:58:30.671
the majority of the adult male citizens were excluded from some important

714
00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:36.400
elements in the democracy although as time passes that last disappears and you

715
00:58:37.881 --> 00:58:41.090
have pretty much complete participation by the poor.

716
00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:43.040
But in Kleist in his case that's not so.

717
00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:48.020
<v 12>But I think that's to be deliberately blind to what's really happening.</v>

718
00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:53.620
What you have is a miracle nothing in the world that we know of anywhere.

719
00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:58.250
Everything like this has ever been seen before.

720
00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:03.350
The reaction of the other Greeks as best we can figure out was horror.

721
00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:08.450
This is wild and crazy the stuff that the Athenians are doing.

722
00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:11.240
It is radical it is dangerous.

723
00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:15.980
We must contain ourselves and avoid being in touch with them.

724
00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:17.750
But what we should try to finish those guys off.

725
00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:21.860
Certainly that was the attitude the Spartans typically had towards it and

726
00:59:21.861 --> 00:59:26.220
undoubtedly the normal Greek government which was in an oligarchy.

727
00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:28.190
Certainly took the same point of view.

728
00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:32.240
So I think you can look at it from either direction probably should look at him

729
00:59:32.241 --> 00:59:33.074
from both.

730
00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:38.120
But don't miss the point that what's happening here is of this very special

731
00:59:38.121 --> 00:59:42.970
character.
What did they call this constitution.

732
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.990
Well we don't know yet but the chances are great that they did not call it

733
00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:47.883
democracy.

734
00:59:48.490 --> 00:59:52.450
The word democracy our democracy comes from the Greek democratic.

735
00:59:53.110 --> 00:59:57.550
Which I guess you would want to translate is something like power.
For.

736
00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:01.960
The masses for the people at large for the people as a whole.

737
01:00:02.590 --> 01:00:06.880
But it was a name that was given to the Athenian constitution by people who

738
01:00:06.881 --> 01:00:10.780
didn't like it.
Why did they think of themselves.

739
01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:16.110
<v 6>Well Robert this refers to this regime as one of these so no media</v>

740
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:21.140
equality of law.

741
01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:26.780
Oh and I think the thing that's most important about is equality before the law.

742
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:34.990
That is something that wipes out distinctions among classes of people on the

743
01:00:35.841 --> 01:00:39.050
basis that it when it comes to the law.

744
01:00:39.290 --> 01:00:43.610
Every man who comes before the law is equal to every other man.

745
01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:48.560
Well that's a very big change that no place else in the world had.

746
01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.830
And I think that's not a bad way to think of it.

747
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:57.190
And one of the principles that belong from the first to this democracy and was

748
01:00:59.181 --> 01:01:04.181
maybe as crucial as anything in characterizing it was what they called you say

749
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:10.950
go read equality but equality of speech really meant equality of the opportunity

750
01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:18.470
to address the political body meaning the assembly.

751
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:24.010
Every Athenian male from the first adult who was regardless of what his money

752
01:01:28.161 --> 01:01:32.360
rating was of his class whether he was feet or higher.

753
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:37.160
Everyone had the right to speak in the assembly.

754
01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:42.630
Now this had been a right that was limited of course to aristocrats in many

755
01:01:43.971 --> 01:01:46.370
cities or to the wealthy in other cities.

756
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.000
But we know from the some of the poems in the fifth and the sixth century it was

757
01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:57.610
prized as the evidence that an individual was a free man as opposed to a slave.

758
01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.500
He could get up in the center.

759
01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:09.650
That was the term they use of the town meaning where the meeting place was and

760
01:02:09.651 --> 01:02:14.651
then speak his mind and also try to persuade his fellow citizens to do as he

761
01:02:14.841 --> 01:02:15.674
thought best.

762
01:02:15.830 --> 01:02:20.830
We should not take this lightly in our world where we never imagined ourselves

763
01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.310
in such a situation.

764
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:28.100
It's hard to grasp but actually to think if I want to I can get out there during

765
01:02:28.101 --> 01:02:32.030
the debate that's going to decide what happens and I can say what I have to say.

766
01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:36.950
<v 14>So freedom of speech very very central to</v>

767
01:02:39.010 --> 01:02:41.960
to the Athenian idea of self-government.

768
01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:50.040
<v 6>The role of the ballet in place of aristocratic councils enhances the democracy</v>

769
01:02:53.530 --> 01:02:54.363
there.

770
01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:58.410
On the other hand things did not happen that you might think what happened.

771
01:02:59.590 --> 01:03:04.210
Nothing was done in the sphere of the economy.

772
01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:09.690
<v 16>There was no change in slowness in classes or privileges.</v>

773
01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:14.460
You still had to have a certain amount of money to be elected to the top things

774
01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:18.990
in the state.
The area of business was left untouched.

775
01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:24.200
Remaining a collection of former magistrates all of whom had been aristocrats

776
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:29.870
the factories the home of aristocracy were left intact you had this hot light

777
01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:35.670
democracy which was indeed democracy but we must imagine.

778
01:03:35.730 --> 01:03:39.900
I think all the evidence would support this imagination that.

779
01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:46.160
It was a deferential democracy in which the lower classes still looked up to the

780
01:03:49.961 --> 01:03:54.961
upper classes for leadership and guidance and they themselves did not hold

781
01:03:55.241 --> 01:03:59.190
leading positions in the state.
I think that's the picture we have.

782
01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:03.850
Well let me try it last to one of the most to melt to my mind one of the most

783
01:04:03.851 --> 01:04:08.851
interesting features of the Constitution introduced by Kleist and this gives us

784
01:04:10.601 --> 01:04:15.520
a picture of how things worked that we wouldn't get any of any other way.

785
01:04:15.550 --> 01:04:18.850
I'm talking about the law that was passed.

786
01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:21.370
<v 12>On ostracism.</v>

787
01:04:22.090 --> 01:04:25.390
Our word ostracism derives from it but it's something quite different.

788
01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:29.890
If you somebody says we're going to ostracize this guy today it means we're not

789
01:04:29.891 --> 01:04:31.000
going to invite him for a drink.

790
01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:33.780
We're not going to go to his parties things like that.

791
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:38.590
Now this was something far different and was a central part of the political

792
01:04:38.591 --> 01:04:39.424
system.

793
01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:42.920
<v 14>Let me begin by simply describing how it worked.</v>

794
01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:48.660
<v 16>Every year let us say in the month of January that's the way the Italian</v>

795
01:04:48.661 --> 01:04:50.730
calendar would have made it come out more or less.

796
01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:55.910
Typically a vote automatically came up a question came up in the assembly

797
01:04:57.721 --> 01:05:00.390
automatically.
Nobody had to move it.
It was an automatic thing.

798
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.200
Question was shall we have an ostracism this year.

799
01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.020
Now they could debate that question.

800
01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:10.350
But what they were not debating was who should we ostracize.

801
01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:14.670
That was not an issue.
The only prints question was Should we have one this year.

802
01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:19.510
And if a majority said yes.
Then they would go on.

803
01:05:19.530 --> 01:05:22.350
If the majority said no that was it no ostracism that year.

804
01:05:22.830 --> 01:05:25.470
But supposing a majority had voted for an ostracism.

805
01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:31.190
Now we go to roughly the month of March and let's go down to the centre of town

806
01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:37.710
the Agora which is the marketplace which is the political centre which is where

807
01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:41.730
people go to talk and all those things.
That's where the action is.

808
01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.650
And for that day in that day alone.

809
01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:49.430
The Agora is fenced off and there are 10 gates in the fences one for each tribe.

810
01:05:52.770 --> 01:05:53.603
<v 6>And</v>

811
01:05:55.020 --> 01:06:00.020
every citizen who wishes goes with a piece of broken pottery.

812
01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:06.620
Someone has described it as the scrap paper of antiquity.

813
01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:13.520
And with whatever you could get a piece of glass crayon or whatever you would

814
01:06:14.791 --> 01:06:19.791
simply write the name of a man that you would like to see ostracized.

815
01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:24.110
That year you would go to the gate.

816
01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:28.760
There would be some but people at the gate who would would identify you really

817
01:06:28.761 --> 01:06:29.840
as citizen where you come in.

818
01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:35.620
You handed in your Astrakhan and you went inside the eagle rock where you stayed

819
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:39.410
until the voting was over so that you couldn't come back and vote again.

820
01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:43.760
They were cleverer than the people of Florida are today.

821
01:06:45.830 --> 01:06:48.740
So now it's over.

822
01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:50.980
The time has come.

823
01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:56.880
<v 17>And what they do is they divide up all the obstacles that have been cast and</v>

824
01:06:57.150 --> 01:07:00.150
they don't divide them up.
I'm sorry they put them in a big pile and counting.

825
01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:06.650
If there are fewer than 6000 ballots nobody gets ostracized

826
01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:10.530
if there are six thousand or more.

827
01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:15.560
Now they divide them up into piles and the one who gets the most votes not

828
01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:17.993
majority.

829
01:07:18.450 --> 01:07:22.630
<v 14>Just the highest number of votes plurality he wins</v>

830
01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:26.220
he gets ostracized.

831
01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:27.970
<v 12>What does that mean.</v>

832
01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:34.080
It means that he must leave Attica for at a certain distance from Attica to for

833
01:07:35.921 --> 01:07:36.820
10 years.

834
01:07:38.890 --> 01:07:42.980
That's all he has been accused of no crime.

835
01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:45.130
Therefore he has been convicted of no crime.

836
01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:51.320
Nothing is done to his property.
Nothing is done to his family.

837
01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:55.340
At the end of 10 years he may come back.

838
01:07:56.350 --> 01:07:58.240
And it's as though he never left.

839
01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:03.840
<v 17>The next day if he wants to we can run for public office that's all that is</v>

840
01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:07.960
ostracism.
What's this all about.

841
01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:10.240
What are the purposes of this thing.

842
01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:15.840
Well I think the best way to come at this is to tell you a couple of stories and

843
01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:18.273
some facts.

844
01:08:19.650 --> 01:08:24.650
The story I guess comes from Plutarch life of Arab Studies who is one of the

845
01:08:26.101 --> 01:08:31.101
leading Athenian figures at the early part of the fifth century and who in fact.

846
01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:36.600
<v 12>Was a man who was ultimately ostracized.
The story goes like this.</v>

847
01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:41.780
It's ostracism day in Athens and some country bumpkin some rube comes walking up

848
01:08:44.341 --> 01:08:49.341
and he spots outside is chatting with some folks and he goes up to reciting says

849
01:08:50.341 --> 01:08:51.300
Excuse me sir.

850
01:08:52.530 --> 01:08:56.630
I don't know how to write would you please write a name on this shirt for me.

851
01:08:57.810 --> 01:09:01.710
I recite is of course a gentleman.
He says suddenly Sir what name would you like.

852
01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:07.460
He said the Arab state is please oh he says write down every.

853
01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:12.460
<v 17>And by the way said What is it that you have against Arab state.</v>

854
01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:19.860
I should have told you that Arab Studies had earned the sobriquet the just Arab

855
01:09:21.061 --> 01:09:25.460
state is that just so the guy says Well what have you got against them.

856
01:09:25.710 --> 01:09:26.690
<v 18>I have nothing against the.</v>

857
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:30.960
I've never seen the man don't know I'm just so damn tired of hearing him called

858
01:09:31.190 --> 01:09:32.023
the just.

859
01:09:34.110 --> 01:09:37.980
<v 12>The point of that story is to illustrate Plutarch point is that</v>

860
01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:46.380
the system of ostracism was just a piece of silly foolishness that you would

861
01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:52.740
associate with democracy which just allowed the jealousy of the ordinary man for

862
01:09:53.531 --> 01:09:56.410
superior people to determine what's going on.

863
01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:00.400
That's the message that Plutarch gets from that tale.

864
01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:02.960
Here's another piece of information that's not a tale.

865
01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:08.080
I think it's about 1937 38 an American archaeologist was working up on on the

866
01:10:08.081 --> 01:10:13.081
north slope of the Acropolis and he came upon a well he dug into the well and

867
01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:19.620
out came one hundred and ninety one inscribed punctures Astrakhan

868
01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:28.330
but one name written on all of them and that name was Mr. Cleese who we know was

869
01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:36.700
a participant in a batch of Astrakhan and the for a ostracism and for a and

870
01:10:37.701 --> 01:10:42.370
careful analysis of the handwriting indicated that these one hundred and ninety

871
01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:47.371
one Austria were inscribed by 14 hands writing them begins to sound familiar.

872
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:54.310
<v 6>You guys I suppose is the best guess of everybody who studies these things is</v>

873
01:10:54.441 --> 01:10:59.441
that we do not have here the remains of a collection of voters who voted and had

874
01:11:01.551 --> 01:11:05.390
their votes counted and then these came but rather that these were votes that

875
01:11:05.391 --> 01:11:07.510
never were cast actually

876
01:11:09.690 --> 01:11:10.740
so what's going on here.

877
01:11:11.670 --> 01:11:16.140
<v 12>Now I turned from my attempt at a factual account of what happened in the past</v>

878
01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:20.040
to fiction.
The rest of this is my imagination.

879
01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:26.390
And we find ourselves down the middle of Athens the day before the ostracism.

880
01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:32.070
We are in the home of John Potter.

881
01:11:33.450 --> 01:11:38.190
Who is a charter member of the Arab state his political club

882
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:44.750
and what they are doing is sitting about chatting as they in size or paint the

883
01:11:45.751 --> 01:11:50.070
name on to a Astrakhan.

884
01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:55.280
The name is to mystically next day down there outside the agora.

885
01:11:57.830 --> 01:12:02.830
Various country bumpkins and others wandering into town and you step up to one

886
01:12:03.231 --> 01:12:06.610
of them and say perhaps you would like to vote in the ostracism today sir.

887
01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:10.730
I can save you the trouble of inscribe in your ballot.
Here's one right now.

888
01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:16.040
I think this is pretty good evidence that we're talking about organized

889
01:12:16.041 --> 01:12:21.041
political activities which in fact I think totally squares with what we know

890
01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:26.570
about the purpose of ostracism.

891
01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:33.110
I should tell you one other thing that Cincinnati's himself says something very

892
01:12:33.111 --> 01:12:33.950
important about this.

893
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:39.310
He says ostracism was brought about because of the fear and the insecurity that

894
01:12:40.041 --> 01:12:45.041
the Athenians felt about their democracy that it was in constant danger and that

895
01:12:45.471 --> 01:12:46.790
they needed something to help them.

896
01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:51.830
<v 16>That's the context in which he views it Plutarch as I say has a more general</v>

897
01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:55.360
story the envy and jealousy natural to democracy.

898
01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:59.270
You must have realized that hardly anybody whoever wrote anything in antiquity

899
01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:01.560
had a kind word to say for democracy.

900
01:13:02.150 --> 01:13:07.150
It is a it's a bad thing from the standpoint of most of the authors of antiquity

901
01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:12.770
but the facilities was there while ostracism was a reality as opposed to

902
01:13:12.771 --> 01:13:17.330
Plutarch and I'm sure he is right.

903
01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:20.113
Let's look.

904
01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:25.810
<v 6>First of all at the moment when ostracism was invented in the time of Kleist</v>

905
01:13:27.451 --> 01:13:31.450
Denise.
And before we move beyond that what's the situation.

906
01:13:32.170 --> 01:13:37.170
Close the knees and company have just brought about this unique amazing end to

907
01:13:37.211 --> 01:13:38.050
the rest of the world.

908
01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:43.260
Dangerous cold data an invented this new wild crazy kind of government they

909
01:13:44.111 --> 01:13:44.944
know.

910
01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:49.960
That the Spartans are furious and they expect they're going to come down

911
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:51.163
anytime.

912
01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:57.200
They also know that in Athens there are people who don't like this new

913
01:13:57.601 --> 01:13:58.434
government.

914
01:13:58.830 --> 01:14:02.910
Some of them are the heirs to the old aristocracy.

915
01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.340
Some of them are aristocrats themselves.

916
01:14:07.170 --> 01:14:12.000
<v 15>Others were very happy in the days of the tyranny.</v>

917
01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:17.030
In fact there are still relatives of the tyrants eminent ones who are still in

918
01:14:19.081 --> 01:14:22.020
Athens.
In other words they have to fear

919
01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:24.613
betrayal.

920
01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:28.850
<v 12>They have to fear internal hostility they have to fear people might start a</v>

921
01:14:28.851 --> 01:14:29.684
civil war.

922
01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:34.720
At the same time as they have to be afraid of the Spartans coming up the road

923
01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:38.510
and we know because in a few years this is going to happen.

924
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:43.750
They have enemies of other neighboring states Corinthians directorates.

925
01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:50.290
Others will be oceans thieves and within the next five years they will have.

926
01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:55.350
Invasions by those people as well.
That's their situation.

927
01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:56.450
What are they afraid of.

928
01:14:56.900 --> 01:15:01.900
They are afraid that there will be treason inside the city which will help

929
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:05.900
invaders or simply turn the city over to them.

930
01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:08.210
Well then why don't they just lock these guys up.

931
01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:11.630
Well the first place they probably haven't done anything yet.

932
01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:14.270
And you couldn't make a case against them.

933
01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:20.060
<v 18>On top of which you really don't if you're clean Sunnis you don't want to treat</v>

934
01:15:20.150 --> 01:15:24.230
all of these people as though they are the enemies of the new regime.

935
01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:27.110
They are in fact natural opponents.

936
01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:30.980
That's the Friends of the tyrants and the old aristocrats.

937
01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:32.900
They're on opposite sides of the argument.

938
01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:38.560
Why would you want to put them together by assaulting their leaders.

939
01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:42.650
A smarter thing would be to try to win over.

940
01:15:43.850 --> 01:15:47.600
<v 12>One faction to support of your side at the expense of the other.</v>

941
01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:52.280
And that is my guess as to what is another explanation of what's happening here.

942
01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:55.550
So here's another piece of fiction I want to throw at you.

943
01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:03.040
I imagine that Kleist in these stops by at the house of his parkas the son of

944
01:16:03.741 --> 01:16:08.741
Khamis who is a distant relative of the pious districts and who would be looked

945
01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:14.690
to as the leading figure in that faction and.

946
01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:17.820
He stopped by the sea.

947
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:21.800
Park and Hyde Park this is a low class and they say What is this routine.

948
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:25.340
What is this crazy new law that you and your boys just put through this

949
01:16:25.341 --> 01:16:26.390
ostracism law.

950
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:32.590
<v 19>I hear in the streets that it's aimed at me as the leader of the old terrorist</v>

951
01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:35.413
faction.

952
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:38.450
<v 15>What is that in these I imagine would say.</v>

953
01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:40.850
Now where did you get a crazy idea like that.

954
01:16:40.970 --> 01:16:42.740
I mean that's you're a swell fellow.

955
01:16:43.190 --> 01:16:46.850
I'm only against these terrible risk those out there in this Spartan lackeys

956
01:16:46.851 --> 01:16:49.940
that we're going to take away all the people's rights and I know you wouldn't

957
01:16:49.941 --> 01:16:52.680
want that to happen would be good.
That's not like you.

958
01:16:53.730 --> 01:16:56.900
<v 0>So of course I can see your point.</v>

959
01:16:57.650 --> 01:16:59.000
I can see you are alarmed.

960
01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:05.050
I can see that people might say gee those old hype the past history these people

961
01:17:05.631 --> 01:17:10.090
might be trying to overthrow this new democracy and bring themselves back in.

962
01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:15.400
<v 19>I know hippie is over there in Persia supported by the king and maybe people</v>

963
01:17:15.831 --> 01:17:18.170
would thank you for bringing him back as a tyrant.

964
01:17:18.230 --> 01:17:23.190
<v 0>I know that would never be in your mind.
But I tell you what you ought to do.</v>

965
01:17:23.210 --> 01:17:26.120
Why don't you come over to my side and I'll see to it.

966
01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:29.840
<v 12>You know I have friends I got a lot of friends I could do you a favor</v>

967
01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:36.720
you do me a favor I could do you a favor I could see that I would just kill that

968
01:17:38.141 --> 01:17:41.830
rumor and everything would be very happy next day all as well.

969
01:17:43.150 --> 01:17:45.570
And I think there's considerable evidence I don't have time for it now.

970
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:50.910
<v 0>Not not certain but evidence suggesting that Marcus came on board and became</v>

971
01:17:52.061 --> 01:17:57.061
part of a coalition that ruled Athens for decades after that time.

972
01:17:57.850 --> 01:18:02.850
And so that year there was no ostracism because they didn't have to be in

973
01:18:03.611 --> 01:18:07.030
ostracism.
I think that is very important.

974
01:18:07.090 --> 01:18:12.090
Most years there was no ostracism only once in a while.

975
01:18:12.970 --> 01:18:17.970
And every single person that we hear ostracized was a leading political figure

976
01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:25.380
ostracism ensure it was meant to be a constitutional device to work in the

977
01:18:26.801 --> 01:18:31.801
political realm as a way of deterring a coup de Tau treason or other forms of

978
01:18:34.451 --> 01:18:34.870
unrest.

979
01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:39.870
You could only use it as a politician if you were the popular favorite if you

980
01:18:40.491 --> 01:18:45.491
were confident that the ostracism would go your way if you held in ostracism and

981
01:18:45.731 --> 01:18:46.480
that wasn't true.

982
01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:49.930
You might find yourself traveling a long way from home pretty soon.

983
01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:53.020
And so that's the essence of ostracism.

984
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:58.060
And we'll have a look at it again because it crops up and is used but not for 20

985
01:18:58.061 --> 01:19:00.750
years after it's invented.
OK.
