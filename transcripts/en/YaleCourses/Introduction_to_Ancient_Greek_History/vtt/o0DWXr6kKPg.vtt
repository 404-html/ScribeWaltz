1
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.190
I was trying to describe to you how the Athenian democracy in its full form

2
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.060
after the reforms that were instituted by Pericles after the death of Effie

3
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:18.320
outis how that how that system worked.

4
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.450
And I described the what we would call the legislative branch and the much less

5
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.410
significant executive branch and now I'd like to turn to what we would call the

6
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.270
judicial branch.

7
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.140
Now this Athenian judicial system I think might seem even more strange to the

8
00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:46.840
modern eye than the rest of the Constitution.

9
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.060
<v 1>You start with this panel of six thousand jurors who enlisted to serve in the</v>

10
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:59.820
courts each year on any given day.

11
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.270
The jurors who showed up to accept an assignment were assigned to specific

12
00:01:06.181 --> 00:01:11.181
courts and to specific cases the usual size of a jury seems to have been five

13
00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:15.750
hundred and one.

14
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.530
<v 0>Although there were juries of from a small as 51 to as many as fifteen hundred</v>

15
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.720
and one in depending on what the case was whether it was public or private and

16
00:01:32.721 --> 00:01:37.721
also how important it was to avoid any possibility of bribery or partiality.

17
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.120
The Athenians evolved an astonishingly complicated system of assignments that

18
00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:49.730
effectively prevented tampering.

19
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.200
That system is described in Aristotle's constitution of Athens.

20
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.070
I think it's chapter sixty one if any of you think that you have about a month

21
00:01:58.071 --> 00:01:58.970
or two to spare.

22
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.750
Read that paragraph and tell me what the hell it means how it works is so

23
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.900
complicated and the point is that they wanted to be sure that it was just

24
00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:13.580
impossible for anybody to know who was going to be on a particular jury panel

25
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.820
for a particular case so that if you wanted to bribe anybody you'd have to bribe

26
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:22.490
six thousand people and that might be mildly discouraging you might say that's

27
00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:24.620
that's an honest bunch of people boy.

28
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.720
Well you don't devise such a complicated system if everybody isn't busily

29
00:02:29.721 --> 00:02:30.860
thinking of a way to cheat.

30
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.420
It seems to me however they would have failed the system certainly was

31
00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:36.050
foolproof.

32
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.050
I think the legal procedure was remarkably different from what takes place in a

33
00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:44.450
modern American court.

34
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.100
<v 2>The first surprise you would meet is the absence of any public prosecutor or</v>

35
00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:53.660
state's attorney.

36
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.180
In fact there are no lawyers at all.

37
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.740
Think of that.
Think of how happy that would make Shakespeare.

38
00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.670
<v 1>Complaints whether they were civil or criminal.
Public or private.</v>

39
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Large or small were registered and argued by private citizens plaintiff and

40
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:23.611
defendant sewer and sue each made his case in his own voice.

41
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.120
If not in his own language because anyone was free to hire a speechwriter to

42
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:37.171
help him prepare his case and that profession flourished in Athens although it

43
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:44.101
reached its peak only many years after the days of Pericles the greatest writers

44
00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:49.630
of courtroom speeches that have been preserved and I believe they were preserved

45
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.250
because generations thought they were the very best speeches that were come from

46
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:56.680
the next century from the 4th century B.C..

47
00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.920
Here's another surprise.

48
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.980
There is no judge the jury was everything.

49
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.680
<v 3>No self respecting Athenian Democrat would allow some individual whatever his</v>

50
00:04:10.681 --> 00:04:15.681
qualifications to tell him what was relevant evidence and what was not or which

51
00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:22.170
laws or which precedents apply from the Athenian point of view that would give

52
00:04:22.171 --> 00:04:26.250
too much weight to learning and to expertise.

53
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.940
<v 1>And it would also create the danger of corruption and undemocratic prejudice.</v>

54
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.390
I mean if the judge you couldn't conceive conceal who the judge was going to be

55
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.730
as well as you could the jurors.

56
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.290
And so you could if he if there was a judge and he was important you might be

57
00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:44.124
able to bribe him.

58
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.110
Indeed in our own system it is not unheard of that judges are bribed.

59
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.890
It's not even unheard of that they were unduly prejudiced in one direction or

60
00:04:54.891 --> 00:04:57.540
another.
You've seen seniors would have none of that.

61
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.610
So it was up to the contestants in the case to cite the relevant laws and

62
00:05:04.881 --> 00:05:05.714
precedents.

63
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.730
And it was up to the jurors to decide between the plaintiff and the defendant so

64
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.880
in fundamental matters of justice and fairness the Athenian Democrat put very

65
00:05:20.751 --> 00:05:22.820
little faith in experts.

66
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.470
This was one of the most democratic aspects of this democratic constitution.

67
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.490
The assumption that all citizens had enough sense and enough of whatever else it

68
00:05:33.681 --> 00:05:38.681
took to make the judgments that were so important in the courts in the courtroom

69
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.180
the plaintiff and defendant each had an opportunity to present his case also to

70
00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:48.200
rebut his opponent.

71
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.270
To cite what was thought to be the relevant law.

72
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.200
To produce witnesses and then to sum up his case each.

73
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.350
Now here's another amazing thing from an American perspective.

74
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.530
Each case I'm sorry each phase in the case was limited to a specific amount of

75
00:06:09.311 --> 00:06:14.311
time which was kept by an official using a water clock and no trial gets this

76
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.790
lasted more than a single day.

77
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.780
Finally the case went to the jury which of course received no charge or

78
00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:34.370
instructions since there was no judge to tell them what they had to think about

79
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.640
and what possibilities were available.

80
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.630
The jury did not deliberate.

81
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.200
You didn't have fifteen and one fifteen hundred and one angry men

82
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.470
they just voted.
By secret ballot.

83
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:55.570
And a simple majority decided the issue if.

84
00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.470
A penalty was called for and it was not one that was described by law.

85
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.850
And very few penalties were described by law.

86
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.570
The following procedure was used.

87
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.650
The plaintiff who had won the case proposed a penalty.

88
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.900
The defendant then had the opportunity to propose a different penalty.

89
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.770
The jury then again no deliberation just voted to choose one or the other but

90
00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:28.530
they could not propose anything of their own.

91
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:35.090
No creative penalties were possible just one or the other of the ones proposed

92
00:07:36.481 --> 00:07:37.314
by each side.

93
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.850
Normally this process led both sides.

94
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.940
If you think about it to suggest moderate penalties for the jury would be put

95
00:07:47.431 --> 00:07:50.640
off by an unreasonable suggestion one way or another.

96
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.740
<v 4>If the plaintiff asked for too heavy a penalty that would guarantee they would</v>

97
00:07:55.741 --> 00:08:00.741
take the other guy's penalty and vice versa critics of this system complain that

98
00:08:01.991 --> 00:08:05.830
democracy made the Athenians litigious.

99
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:11.580
<v 5>The system contained a device therefore well not therefore but as a matter of</v>

100
00:08:12.941 --> 00:08:16.210
fact in contradiction to that.
No let me back up.

101
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:21.300
Of course Athenians were litigious and knowing that they built in an element

102
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.120
meant to reduce the degree of unfounded unreasonable silly or just terrible

103
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:31.300
accusations

104
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.980
the system contained this device.

105
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:41.190
<v 4>If the plaintiffs did not win a stated percentage of the jurors votes then he</v>

106
00:08:43.271 --> 00:08:46.260
was required to pay a considerable fine

107
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.460
in public prosecutions.

108
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:54.020
<v 1>He paid it to the state in private past prosecutions he paid it to the
defendant.</v>

109
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:59.710
And surely this must have served as a significant deterrent for frivolous

110
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.210
malevolent and merely adventurous suits.

111
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:11.650
<v 5>Just think of how it would change our system if we had something like that.</v>

112
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:18.200
If the way we do we do have a lot of some of it available in our own system.

113
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:23.860
It is possible for instance if somebody brings a suit against somebody else and

114
00:09:23.901 --> 00:09:28.901
fails it is possible for the judge to decide that the defeated side must pay

115
00:09:31.251 --> 00:09:36.251
court costs which is a form of a defense against the frivolous charges.

116
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.540
But it wasn't.

117
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:43.280
It isn't anything as thorough as the Athenian system which always had that

118
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:44.263
around.

119
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.470
So if you had a case that wasn't going to win many friends on the jury it was

120
00:09:48.471 --> 00:09:49.850
going to cost you one way or another.

121
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.580
Well this Athenian system of justice had many flaws.

122
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:59.480
Obviously decisions could be quirky.

123
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:04.320
And unpredictable since they were unchecked by precedent.

124
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:09.950
Juries could be prejudiced and the jurors had no defense except their own

125
00:10:09.951 --> 00:10:14.951
intelligence and knowledge against speakers who cited laws incorrectly and who

126
00:10:16.311 --> 00:10:20.960
distorted history and we have speeches in law courts in which these guys are

127
00:10:20.961 --> 00:10:25.220
making up laws that nobody ever heard of and that they are making arguments that

128
00:10:25.221 --> 00:10:30.221
are terrible so that they did abuse this opportunity.

129
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.890
There's no question about it.

130
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.660
Speeches unhampered by rules of evidence and relevance and without the

131
00:10:37.661 --> 00:10:42.661
discipline imposed by judges could be fanciful false and sophisticated.

132
00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.320
There's one anecdote that is handed down about a famous Athenian.

133
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.600
After that I think gives you some clue about this.
Yeah.

134
00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:56.820
This was listeners who lived at the end of the 5th century and into the 4th and

135
00:10:58.151 --> 00:11:01.750
he was one of the greats successful speechwriters in Athens.

136
00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:06.520
Well somebody came to him and said I'm involved in this lawsuit licious and I'd

137
00:11:06.521 --> 00:11:11.380
like to pay you for writing a speech on my site which is fine.

138
00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:13.780
He went home he wrote the speech.

139
00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:18.470
He brought it to the man and said Here it is the guy read it.

140
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:23.260
<v 2>He said listen this is terrific great speech.
I can't lose.</v>

141
00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.460
Thanks a million this just goes on a little while later.

142
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.850
This is here's a banging on his door.
It's the same guy he's in.

143
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.240
This Yes I read that speech again.

144
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:39.190
<v 6>Was I wrong.
It's filled with terrible arguments contradictions.</v>

145
00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:43.690
There are holes in your logic that they can run trucks through.

146
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.300
<v 5>And Lissy says Calm down my friend.</v>

147
00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.090
<v 1>The jury will only hear this speech once</v>

148
00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:58.090
so of course all of these flaws were there.

149
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:04.860
Yet from a modern perspective I would argue that the Athenian system had a

150
00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:06.970
number of attractions.

151
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:13.170
The American legal system and court procedures have been blamed for excessive

152
00:12:14.291 --> 00:12:19.291
technicality verging on incomprehensible ability and for the central role of

153
00:12:21.611 --> 00:12:26.611
lawyers and judges which give an enormous advantage to the rich who can afford

154
00:12:28.511 --> 00:12:33.511
to pay the burgeoning costs of participating in the legal system the absence

155
00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:39.700
typically of a sufficient deterrent to unfounded lawsuits has helped to crowd

156
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:45.850
court calendars time spent in jury selection which didn't take any time at all

157
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:52.190
of course in Athens and wrangling over legal technicalities stretches out still

158
00:12:53.701 --> 00:12:57.270
further a process that has no time limit.

159
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:03.420
It is not uncommon for participants in a lawsuit to wait for many years before

160
00:13:03.421 --> 00:13:04.290
coming to trial.

161
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:09.300
Sometimes the plaintiff has died before his case gets to court.

162
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:15.680
Not everyone is convinced that the gain in the scrupulous protection of the

163
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:20.720
participants rights in an increasingly complex code of legal procedure is worth

164
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:23.940
the resulting delay.

165
00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:29.210
And some point to the principle that justice delayed is justice denied often in

166
00:13:31.131 --> 00:13:31.760
our courts.

167
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.760
Decisions are made by judges on very remote difficult legal or procedural

168
00:13:38.031 --> 00:13:42.290
grounds that are incomprehensible to the ordinary citizen.

169
00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:48.340
<v 4>As a result there is much criticism of judges and lawyers and a loss of faith in</v>

170
00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:53.260
general in the legal system for all its flaws.

171
00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:58.280
I think the Athenian system was simple speedy open and very easily understood by

172
00:14:01.891 --> 00:14:02.820
its citizens.

173
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:08.700
It did contain provisions aimed at producing moderate penalties and at deterring

174
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.760
unreasonable lawsuits it placed no barriers of legal technicalities or legal

175
00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:17.900
experts between the citizens and their laws.

176
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:23.140
Counting as always on the common sense of the ordinary Athenian

177
00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:30.140
now the Athenian democratic system as a whole brought to its height in the time

178
00:14:30.141 --> 00:14:35.000
of Pericles has been harshly criticized through the ages.

179
00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.100
Immediately by

180
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:43.690
contemporaries who were hostile to the democracy and through the centuries by

181
00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:50.170
people who have looked at Athenian history as it was depicted by the surviving

182
00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:55.210
authors and concluded harsh conclusions about democracy ancient rivals directed

183
00:14:56.801 --> 00:15:01.780
most of their attacks against the idea of government by mass meaning and the

184
00:15:01.781 --> 00:15:06.781
selection of public officials by allotment the Athenian renegade al-Sabah

185
00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.440
pieties told a Spartan audience.

186
00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:15.920
As for democracy nothing new can be said about it and acknowledged foolishness

187
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:23.910
Plato has Socrates make the same point more fully and seriously Socrates

188
00:15:25.121 --> 00:15:30.121
observes that when it is a matter of building a house or a ship the Athenian

189
00:15:31.331 --> 00:15:34.240
assembly listens only to experts.

190
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:39.790
If someone without expert qualifications tries to give advice in such things

191
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:44.680
even if he is very handsome and rich and noble they refuse to listen to.

192
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:50.740
Instead they laugh and hoot at him until either he is shouted down and withdraws

193
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:52.880
of his own accord.

194
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:58.720
Or the Sergeant at Arms drag him off or he is expelled by order of the president

195
00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:01.650
so you just imagine that.

196
00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.050
<v 5>When you get up to speak in the Athenian assembly you better be ready for</v>

197
00:16:07.051 --> 00:16:07.884
anything

198
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.410
but when the discussion is about affairs of state says Socrates.

199
00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:17.920
<v 4>Anyone can get up to speak Carpenter Tinker cobbler passenger ship owner Rich</v>

200
00:16:20.331 --> 00:16:25.331
and poor noble and commoner and nobody rebukes him as they did in the earlier

201
00:16:26.631 --> 00:16:31.631
case for trying to give advice when he has no knowledge and has not been taught

202
00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:39.270
now in fact the Athenians did appreciate the importance of knowledge skill

203
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:45.750
talent and experience when they thought these things existed and could be used

204
00:16:47.831 --> 00:16:52.831
in the public interest so they did not a lot but elected military officers.

205
00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.180
Some treasurers naval architects.

206
00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.520
And managers of the water supply.

207
00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:06.420
These are essentially questions of life and death or of the financial security

208
00:17:07.271 --> 00:17:08.104
of the state.

209
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:13.420
Apart from that they did not care much about expertise.

210
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:18.480
If they did not elect professors of political science or philosophers or lawyers

211
00:17:19.421 --> 00:17:24.280
to govern and judge them it was because they were skeptical that there is a

212
00:17:24.281 --> 00:17:29.281
useful expertise in these areas and that if it did exist it could safely and

213
00:17:30.341 --> 00:17:33.340
profitably be employed for the public good.

214
00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:39.210
<v 7>It is not clear to me anyway that the experience of the last twenty five hundred</v>

215
00:17:39.911 --> 00:17:42.340
years has shown them to be wrong.

216
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:48.210
I don't know how many what percentage of the representatives and senators in our

217
00:17:49.331 --> 00:17:54.331
Congress are lawyers by training but whatever that figure is it's far too large.

218
00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:02.050
I think it's really extraordinary that we all sit still for that kind of thing

219
00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:08.220
the kind of variety excuse me of profession that one can find in our society is

220
00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:15.490
absolutely not to be seen in our government institutions.

221
00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:20.380
Well the Athenians would never permit anything so undemocratic as that.

222
00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:26.820
Secondly it is most unlikely that many fools or incompetents played a

223
00:18:28.811 --> 00:18:31.060
significant part in public affairs.

224
00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:36.190
Of course that's the flip side of rejecting expertise and experience.

225
00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:39.190
You may end up with people who don't know what they're talking about in any

226
00:18:39.191 --> 00:18:41.560
shape manner or form having influence.

227
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.690
Well you see seniors knew that and they were worried about it.

228
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:49.830
And I think that they did so perhaps that the possibility of idiots fools jerks

229
00:18:53.741 --> 00:18:55.420
and other unworthy is

230
00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.890
dominating the political decisions.

231
00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:04.270
I don't think that it's clear that we are better off than they are in this

232
00:19:04.271 --> 00:19:05.104
respect.

233
00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:10.170
I offered my William Buckley once said he would rather be ruled governed by the

234
00:19:11.081 --> 00:19:16.081
first forty whenever he said forty fifty people in the Boston telephone

235
00:19:16.451 --> 00:19:18.880
directory than by the Harvard faculty.

236
00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.800
I thought we could all we could all agree with that.

237
00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:25.200
Maybe even the Yale faculty.

238
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.393
I think that.

239
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:36.260
<v 8>It's we ought to think a little bit longer before we assume our system is the</v>

240
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.500
only way one can think about conducting a democracy.

241
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.120
But to get at it.
How the Athenians cope with this problem.

242
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.070
This is the assembly itself.

243
00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:51.640
Was a far less unwieldy or incompetent body than is generally assumed by its

244
00:19:52.731 --> 00:19:56.530
critics and that you might ordinarily think would be the case if you've got five

245
00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.180
six thousand people out there trying to make a decision.

246
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:05.780
<v 7>Think of this if an Athenian citizen attended no more than half the minimum</v>

247
00:20:08.221 --> 00:20:13.221
number of sessions held each year he would hear twenty sets of debates by the

248
00:20:16.921 --> 00:20:18.550
ablest people in the state.

249
00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:24.460
Chiefly elected officials or those who formerly had held elective office the

250
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:30.320
leading politicians in all factions and a considerable number of experts on a

251
00:20:31.111 --> 00:20:36.111
variety of subjects who would simply get up and express their views and these

252
00:20:36.621 --> 00:20:41.621
were true debates in which it was not possible to hold two prepared remarks and

253
00:20:43.511 --> 00:20:44.344
look at your.

254
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:48.220
<v 8>What do they call these books that they use their policy books or whether</v>

255
00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:54.220
they were real debate and the speakers had to respond extemporaneously to

256
00:20:54.221 --> 00:20:59.221
difficult questions and arguments from the opposition nor were they they

257
00:21:00.461 --> 00:21:02.110
irresponsible displays.

258
00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:07.140
But serious controversy is leading immediately to votes that had important

259
00:21:08.141 --> 00:21:10.620
consequences for the orators and their audience.

260
00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:16.540
Now if you assume that each attendant at the Assembly had been listening to such

261
00:21:16.701 --> 00:21:20.900
discussions for an average of only ten years and many of them would have had a

262
00:21:20.901 --> 00:21:23.380
much longer stretch think of it.
Think of it.

263
00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:28.810
Such experiences alone must have fashioned a remarkable body of voters.

264
00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:35.530
Probably I would argue more enlightened and sophisticated than any comparable

265
00:21:36.231 --> 00:21:37.100
group in history.

266
00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:43.340
Apart from that every year 500 Athenians served on the council where every day

267
00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:50.460
they gained experience in the management of Athens affairs from the most trivial

268
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:56.670
to the most serious producing bills that served as the basis for the debates and

269
00:21:57.311 --> 00:21:58.360
votes of the assembly.

270
00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:04.170
So in any particular assembly thousands of those attending perhaps a majority of

271
00:22:06.401 --> 00:22:11.401
them would have had that kind of training on the council in light of that

272
00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:13.800
breadth of experience.

273
00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:19.010
The notion that decisions were made by an ignorant multitude is simply not

274
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.273
persuasive.

275
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.830
<v 9>I like to compare that situation with something that I think perhaps we can</v>

276
00:22:25.831 --> 00:22:30.831
understand in the 19th century when people went to a concert of what we call

277
00:22:31.731 --> 00:22:32.960
classical music.

278
00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:38.780
Almost everybody in the audience was a musician of some kind.

279
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:44.350
Was that before radio television recording systems if you wanted music you had

280
00:22:45.591 --> 00:22:46.424
to play it.

281
00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:51.850
And so people especially women but men too studied how to play various

282
00:22:53.361 --> 00:22:57.530
instruments and they could say they could read music and they could understand

283
00:22:57.531 --> 00:23:02.360
it in a way that only a participant can hardly anybody who goes to a concert

284
00:23:02.361 --> 00:23:04.820
today is in that situation.

285
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:09.080
So Beethoven and Brahms and people like that.

286
00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:14.090
<v 8>Wrote their compositions and played there and the orchestras and so on played.</v>

287
00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:18.170
Those compositions to people who were in a certain sense almost experts in any

288
00:23:18.171 --> 00:23:21.800
case very well-educated amateurs.
And it's.

289
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:26.390
That's the analogy I would suggest that we're talking about that the

290
00:23:26.391 --> 00:23:30.920
professional politicians so to speak insofar as they're worrying in Athens were

291
00:23:30.921 --> 00:23:34.280
dealing with people who didn't just come in off the street and didn't know

292
00:23:34.281 --> 00:23:35.120
anything about it.

293
00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:40.570
<v 7>They were prepared by their life's experience to be a very very tough audience</v>

294
00:23:41.331 --> 00:23:42.164
indeed.

295
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:47.890
But that raises the question were debates in the assembly carried on by ordinary

296
00:23:48.111 --> 00:23:53.111
citizens without the necessary special knowledge and capacity for informed

297
00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:54.164
advice.

298
00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:59.840
The evidence I think suggests not for there were impressive deterrents both

299
00:24:01.471 --> 00:24:06.471
formal and informal that would make an inexperienced ill informed poorly

300
00:24:07.171 --> 00:24:12.171
educated man reluctant to speak up in the Assembly or the council even

301
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:17.180
to begin with I would suggest another analogy for you.

302
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:23.480
<v 10>For many many years I have attended meetings of faculties at great American</v>

303
00:24:23.481 --> 00:24:28.481
universities but I have seen is that very few and generally the same few are

304
00:24:32.151 --> 00:24:37.151
bold enough to speak for or against some not very controversial policy argued in

305
00:24:39.531 --> 00:24:44.531
a group of fewer than a hundred people not to mention those rare larger meetings

306
00:24:45.501 --> 00:24:48.560
when subjects arousing passions are at issue.

307
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:54.750
Now the people we're talking about these faculty meetings have extraordinary

308
00:24:55.511 --> 00:24:56.440
educations.

309
00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:02.680
They are alleged to have unusual intellectual ability and they belong to a

310
00:25:03.961 --> 00:25:07.710
profession where public speaking is part of the trade

311
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:13.710
the meetings are conducted in the decorum of established rules of order that

312
00:25:13.711 --> 00:25:18.711
forbid interruptions and personal attack if a guy wants to say that man is a

313
00:25:18.791 --> 00:25:19.740
goddamn liar.

314
00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:24.580
Somebody will call him to account and say that was a violation of personal

315
00:25:24.581 --> 00:25:25.930
privilege and he should cut it out.

316
00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:28.840
That's not the way it happened in the Athenian assembly.

317
00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:34.980
And yet even at these very very genteel faculty meetings I'm talking about those

318
00:25:35.411 --> 00:25:39.550
who attend them speak very rarely if ever.
Why

319
00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:42.963
why.

320
00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.480
<v 9>What is it that they terms.
I ask you.</v>

321
00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:49.480
For instance you you all know the answer but you won't speak up.

322
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.620
Why why are you afraid to answer that question.
You know the answer.

323
00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.013
<v 8>Thank you.</v>

324
00:25:56.710 --> 00:26:00.970
That's exactly the reason people really are afraid of that.

325
00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:05.290
They're just afraid that even if nobody even tells them that they're stupid just

326
00:26:05.291 --> 00:26:07.870
the way they react and they make them feel as though they are stupid.

327
00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.170
This is a fantastic deterrent.

328
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:14.110
And if we don't understand that we will not understand the way the Athenian

329
00:26:14.111 --> 00:26:18.850
assembly work because that was a made.
But of course you know perfectly well.

330
00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:24.150
Their problem was much greater meetings of the Athenian assembly were not quiet

331
00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:27.720
seemly occasions.
We should not forget what D.K.

332
00:26:27.721 --> 00:26:30.840
chapel has said in Aristophanes play sitting there on the panics.

333
00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:35.830
You say you threatened to shout.
To interrupt to abuse the speakers.

334
00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:37.460
We shouldn't effect.

335
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:42.730
Forget Plato's report of how the Athenians laughed and hooted or shouted down

336
00:26:42.891 --> 00:26:46.850
speakers who lack what they thought was the necessary expertise.

337
00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:51.880
<v 7>Now these informal deterrents alone I believe sharply limited the number of</v>

338
00:26:52.851 --> 00:26:57.851
speakers in the assembly but there was also a formal device that encouraged them

339
00:26:58.361 --> 00:27:03.361
to take thought before they intervene and to be careful in what they said in

340
00:27:04.361 --> 00:27:05.140
these debates.

341
00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:10.140
<v 4>On the next at sometime perhaps during the career of Pericles but certainly not</v>

342
00:27:11.311 --> 00:27:16.311
more than 15 years after his death the Athenians introduced a procedure called

343
00:27:17.151 --> 00:27:22.151
the carafe a part of normal that had the effect of making the citizens in the

344
00:27:23.541 --> 00:27:26.540
assembly the guardians of the constitution.

345
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:32.710
Any citizen could object to a proposal made in the Council or in the assembly

346
00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:38.410
simply by asserting that it contradicted an existing law.

347
00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:45.090
<v 8>That assertion stopped action on the proposal or suspended its enactment if it</v>

348
00:27:46.511 --> 00:27:51.511
had already been passed the proposer was then taken before a popular court.

349
00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:58.450
<v 7>And if the jury decided against him his proposal was disallowed and he was fined</v>

350
00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:05.940
three findings that a person had done this deprived him of his rights as a

351
00:28:06.401 --> 00:28:07.234
citizen.

352
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:13.230
The expectation of the Assembly and its procedures formal and informal.

353
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:19.940
Made it most unlikely that ignorance incompetence played a very significant role

354
00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:22.890
in its deliberations of course.

355
00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:28.380
There was some ignorant imbeciles who nothing will deter but that's true of our

356
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:29.303
system too.

357
00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:35.330
And even graver charge has been leveled through the ages against the kind of

358
00:28:35.331 --> 00:28:37.160
democracy promoted by Pericles.

359
00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:43.120
It is said to be inherently unstable inviting faction and class warfare.

360
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:52.070
It is said to be careless of the rights of property and to result in the rule of

361
00:28:52.161 --> 00:28:52.994
the poor.

362
00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:58.540
These rather the poor who are the majority over the rich minority.

363
00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:04.790
These arguments weighed very heavily in the thinking of the founding fathers of

364
00:29:04.791 --> 00:29:08.300
the American Constitution who rejected democracy.

365
00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:13.330
You need to be aware of that their notion of what democracy was was Athenian

366
00:29:14.111 --> 00:29:19.111
democracy as described by its critics and they consciously and plainly rejected

367
00:29:19.991 --> 00:29:22.030
democracy.
They thought something else.

368
00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:27.390
They thought they were creating a popular Republic and by Republic they meant

369
00:29:29.201 --> 00:29:31.330
something different from democracy.

370
00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:38.940
<v 10>Starting with the fuller democracy instituted by Effi Alves empirically in fact</v>

371
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:46.950
we discover an almost unbroken orderly regime that lasted for one hundred and

372
00:29:48.671 --> 00:29:49.550
forty years.

373
00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:55.460
Twice it was interrupted by oligarchic episodes.

374
00:29:56.330 --> 00:30:00.830
The first resulted from a coup de tah in the midst of a long and difficult war.

375
00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:05.570
The government of that oligarchy lasted just four months.

376
00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:12.550
The second was imposed by the Spartans and after they won the Peloponnesian War

377
00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.920
that one lasted less than a year

378
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:22.630
on each occasion the full democracy was restored without turmoil without class

379
00:30:22.761 --> 00:30:27.761
warfare without killings or exiles of revenge without confiscating the property

380
00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.233
of anybody.

381
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:38.350
<v 7>Through many years of hard warfare military defeat foreign occupation and</v>

382
00:30:39.471 --> 00:30:44.471
oligarchic agitation the Athenian democracy persisted and showed an restraint

383
00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:50.990
and a moderation rarely equaled by any regime.

384
00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:57.730
<v 10>Now this behavior is all the more remarkable in light of the political and</v>

385
00:30:57.891 --> 00:31:02.270
constitutional conditions that prevailed in the proclaimed clean democracy and

386
00:31:02.271 --> 00:31:03.104
thereafter.

387
00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:08.890
Remember that the mass of Athenians were not faced with the power of what has

388
00:31:08.931 --> 00:31:11.810
been called a military industrial complex.

389
00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:17.010
They were not thwarted by the complexities of representative government by

390
00:31:17.011 --> 00:31:21.990
checks and balances by the machinations of unscrupulous lobbyists.

391
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.820
Or manipulated by the irresistible deceptions of mass media

392
00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:33.330
they had only to walk up to the pics on assembly day make speeches and vote.

393
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:41.310
<v 4>In order to bring about the most radical social and economic changes they could</v>

394
00:31:42.651 --> 00:31:43.940
if they had wanted to.

395
00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:49.070
They could have abolished debt which presumably would be something the poor

396
00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.660
would favor.

397
00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:56.650
They could institute confiscatory taxation of the rich in the to the advantage

398
00:31:57.801 --> 00:31:58.634
of the poor.

399
00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.970
<v 6>The simple expropriation of the wealthy few.</v>

400
00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:05.440
All of these things they simply could have done nothing would have stopped them

401
00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.280
but they never did.

402
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:13.530
<v 7>Although political equality that is to say equality before the law that was a</v>

403
00:32:15.461 --> 00:32:20.461
fundamental principle of democracy but economic equality had no place in the

404
00:32:21.191 --> 00:32:22.630
Athens of Pericles.

405
00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:28.610
On the contrary the democracy he led defended the right of private property and

406
00:32:29.701 --> 00:32:34.380
made no effort to change its unequal distributions.

407
00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.800
The oath taken by jurors.

408
00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:42.270
Each time that they sat on the jury included the following clause.

409
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:48.110
I will not allow private debts to be cancelled nor lands or houses belonging to

410
00:32:49.471 --> 00:32:51.960
Athenian citizens to be redistributed.

411
00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:55.890
In addition the Chief Magistrate each year swore.

412
00:32:57.310 --> 00:33:02.310
That whatever anyone owns before I enter this office he will have and hold the

413
00:33:02.891 --> 00:33:04.690
same until I leave it.

414
00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:11.680
Athenians respect for property and their refusal to insist on economic equality

415
00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:18.470
go a long way towards explaining why their democracy was so peaceful.

416
00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:21.930
So stable and so durable.

417
00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:28.300
But why were the majority of citizens so restrained and moderate part of the

418
00:33:30.451 --> 00:33:35.451
answer lies in the relatively broad distribution of property in 5th century

419
00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:42.490
Athens was by no means equal.
I use that.

420
00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:47.430
I want to emphasize the word relatively compared to states that were

421
00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:50.120
oligarchical or aristocratic

422
00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:56.560
and also in its growing prosperity through the greater part of that time.

423
00:33:57.010 --> 00:34:02.010
It's very hard to sustain any kind of a reasonable moderate regime in times that

424
00:34:03.611 --> 00:34:06.880
are hard times in which there is great poverty.

425
00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:11.830
So that was these was certainly among the reasons why Athens was so successful.

426
00:34:11.890 --> 00:34:13.210
But there was always.

427
00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:18.640
We should remember a group of fabulously wealthy citizens and also thousands who

428
00:34:21.481 --> 00:34:23.910
were poor by any standard.

429
00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:29.930
It certainly seems clear that at any time in this period the majority of

430
00:34:30.781 --> 00:34:35.781
Athenian citizens were not rich enough to be whupped lights not rich enough even

431
00:34:37.411 --> 00:34:41.570
to have those small family farms that supported your infant treatment.

432
00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:45.270
So it's not as though there aren't a lot of poor people in the state.

433
00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:48.790
The poorest.

434
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:53.410
Moreover those who lack the property to qualify as infantrymen with the very men

435
00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:58.530
who rode the ships that brought Athens wealth and power and glory.

436
00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:01.420
The last 30 years of the century.

437
00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:06.450
Furthermore what terrible times of war plague impoverishment and defeat yet

438
00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.370
either during or after the war.

439
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:16.790
Did the Athenian masses interfere in any way with private property or seek

440
00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:23.480
economic leveling in the two ways that revolutionaries always wanted it.

441
00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:26.340
Canceling debts and redistributing the land

442
00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:31.670
in the power of clean democracy the Athenians some citizens demanded only

443
00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:34.280
equality before the law.

444
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:38.180
I think that is the key principle to understand when you're thinking about

445
00:35:38.181 --> 00:35:39.230
Athenian democracy.

446
00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:45.220
Full political rights for all citizens and that is what separated the Athenian

447
00:35:46.431 --> 00:35:51.431
democracy from oligarchies and aristocracies and other Greek states and the kind

448
00:35:53.721 --> 00:35:58.721
of even chance that is provided by these two things equality before the law and

449
00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:03.770
participation in the political process for all citizens

450
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:09.860
by these rules the Athenian was willing to abide in the face of the greatest

451
00:36:09.861 --> 00:36:12.020
disasters and the greatest temptations.

452
00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:18.650
It was this politically equal individualistic law abiding and tolerant

453
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:23.710
understanding of the democracy that Pericles had done so much to create and to

454
00:36:24.411 --> 00:36:29.411
which he could appeal and point with pride confident that his fellow citizens

455
00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:35.560
shared his views in their rational secular worldly approach to life in their

456
00:36:38.921 --> 00:36:43.480
commitment to political freedom and to the autonomous importance of the

457
00:36:43.481 --> 00:36:48.190
individual in a constitutional republican and democratic public life.

458
00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:53.940
The Athenians of Pericles day were closer to the dominant ideas and values of

459
00:36:54.941 --> 00:36:59.941
our own era than any culture that has appeared to the world since antiquity.

460
00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:07.210
That is why prickly and apparently in Athens I believe has so much meaning for

461
00:37:07.211 --> 00:37:11.460
us.
But there is much to learn from the similarities.

462
00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:16.620
There's at least as much to learn from the differences between the Athenians and

463
00:37:16.621 --> 00:37:21.621
ourselves although the Athenians valued wealth and material goods as we do.

464
00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:28.790
They regarded economic life and status both as less noble and less important

465
00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:36.140
than participation and distinction in public service to the community although

466
00:37:37.201 --> 00:37:42.201
they were pioneers in recognizing the importance of autonomy and legitimate

467
00:37:42.661 --> 00:37:47.661
claims of the individual they could not imagine the fulfillment of the

468
00:37:48.071 --> 00:37:50.050
individual's spiritual needs.

469
00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:55.680
Apart from his involvement in the life of a well ordered political community to

470
00:37:56.711 --> 00:38:01.711
understand the achievement of Pericles and his contemporaries we just need to be

471
00:38:02.471 --> 00:38:05.170
aware of these significant differences.

472
00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:10.680
I think we ought to also study them with a certain humility for in spite of

473
00:38:11.521 --> 00:38:16.410
their antiquity.
The ancient Athenians may have known and believed things.

474
00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:21.330
We have either forgotten or never known and we ought to keep open the

475
00:38:21.331 --> 00:38:25.680
possibility that in some respects they might have been right.

476
00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.990
About some of these things

477
00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:34.770
now what I've been talking about up to now is the workings of the Athenian

478
00:38:35.411 --> 00:38:38.320
constitution for active citizens.

479
00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:43.350
And I remind you that means three men adults.

480
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:51.480
Who have citizen parents that excludes a lot of people who lived in Athens.

481
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:59.310
And so I'd like to spend a little time also talking about two groups of such

482
00:38:59.321 --> 00:39:04.321
people who were excluded from the political process women and slaves both of

483
00:39:05.711 --> 00:39:10.711
which have caught the attention of modern scholars eager to demonstrate the

484
00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:17.730
undemocratic aspects of ancient Athens when judged by our criteria which seem

485
00:39:19.601 --> 00:39:23.470
more and more to require that every living creature.

486
00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:28.530
I was going to sacred every living thing be treated with equality.

487
00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:34.050
I know that of course there are feelings of people who want to say that and we

488
00:39:34.781 --> 00:39:38.920
all say we all agree there should be no discrimination between men and women.

489
00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:41.620
They of course should be no slaves.

490
00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:47.370
But now we're moving towards saying that people should receive all of

491
00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:50.890
citizenship or citizen rights who aren't.

492
00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.560
Even legally citizens.

493
00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:59.640
There are many people who want to give protections to animals that now are

494
00:39:59.681 --> 00:40:01.420
limited to people.

495
00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:06.930
And there are people also who want to include trees and other vegetation under

496
00:40:07.961 --> 00:40:09.550
these protections.
So

497
00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:16.500
we need to examine the Athenian situation and make our judgments about that.

498
00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:19.040
Let's talk about women first.

499
00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:25.860
Greek society like most cultures throughout history was dominated by men.

500
00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:32.680
This was true of the Democratic city of Athens in the great days of Pericles no

501
00:40:32.681 --> 00:40:34.840
less than in other Greek cities.

502
00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:40.030
Nevertheless the position of women in classical Athens has been the subject of a

503
00:40:40.031 --> 00:40:41.500
great deal of controversy.

504
00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:45.380
The bulk of the evidence coming from the law.

505
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:50.430
The actual laws of Athens from philosophical and moral writings and from

506
00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:55.981
information about the conditions of daily life and the organization of society

507
00:40:56.650 --> 00:41:01.650
shows that women were excluded from most public aspects of I should.

508
00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:07.110
But most aspects of public life.
They could not vote.

509
00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:10.080
They could not take part in the political assemblies.

510
00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:15.120
They could not hold public office or take any direct part in politics.

511
00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:21.290
Male citizens of all classes had these public responsibilities and opportunities

512
00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:27.800
the same sources show that in the private aspects of life women were always

513
00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:33.410
under the control of a male guardian a father at first a husband later or

514
00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:40.450
failing these and appropriate male relative designated by the law.

515
00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:46.580
Women married young usually between the ages of 12 and 18.

516
00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:52.290
I think if we think of them as being about 15 years old we'll probably have a

517
00:41:52.291 --> 00:41:54.090
reasonable average

518
00:41:56.150 --> 00:42:01.150
husbands on the other hand we're typically at least 30 and usually over it when

519
00:42:01.731 --> 00:42:06.731
they married so that women were always in a relationship like that of a daughter

520
00:42:09.231 --> 00:42:10.100
to a father.

521
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:15.430
When you think about the realities of life marriages furthermore were arranged

522
00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:21.700
by the way as in other societies the higher you get in society the more likely

523
00:42:22.971 --> 00:42:27.860
it is that these marriages will be arranged with economic considerations social

524
00:42:27.861 --> 00:42:32.861
considerations predominate predominating as you get lower in society I can I can

525
00:42:32.961 --> 00:42:37.880
only suspect because we don't really have evidence that it was far more informal

526
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:43.690
and maybe that marriages may have been as a consequence of the mutual desire

527
00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:46.910
than was true for the upper classes.

528
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:52.640
Normally these I am shifting again to where we have evidence and that means

529
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.890
probably not the poorest women in the city.

530
00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:00.760
The women normally had no choice of their husband the woman's dowry.

531
00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:03.640
And dowries were required.

532
00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:08.850
He was controlled by a male relative divorce was very difficult for a woman to

533
00:43:10.931 --> 00:43:15.931
obtain for she needed the approval of a male relative who if he gave that

534
00:43:16.661 --> 00:43:21.661
approval had then to be willing to serve as her guardian after the dissolution

535
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:25.780
of her marriage in case of divorce.

536
00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:31.050
The dowry would be returned with the woman but it was still to be controlled.

537
00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:35.800
In that case by her father were the appropriate male relative.

538
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:37.933
Excuse me

539
00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:45.490
the main function and responsibility of a respectable Athenian woman of a

540
00:43:46.241 --> 00:43:51.241
citizen family was to produce male heirs for the household of her husband.

541
00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:58.650
If however her father's household lacked a male heir.

542
00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:02.110
The daughter became what the Greeks called an epic.

543
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:05.140
Clara was the heiress.

544
00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:07.210
To the family property.

545
00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:13.050
In that case she was required by law to marry the man who was the next of kin to

546
00:44:14.501 --> 00:44:15.400
her father's.

547
00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:21.030
Saw on for on her father's side in order to produce the desired male offspring

548
00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:27.420
in the Athenian way of thinking women were lent by one household to another for

549
00:44:29.411 --> 00:44:34.411
purposes of bearing and raising a male heir to continue the existence of the oil

550
00:44:36.341 --> 00:44:39.040
costs the family establishment

551
00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:44.780
because the pure and legitimate lineage of the offspring was important.

552
00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:50.860
Women were carefully segregated from man outside the family and were confined to

553
00:44:53.421 --> 00:44:58.421
the women's quarters even in the house men might seek sexual gratification in

554
00:44:59.481 --> 00:45:04.481
several ways outside the house with prostitutes of high or low style prostitutes

555
00:45:06.711 --> 00:45:11.711
frequently recruited from abroad but respectable women stayed home to raise the

556
00:45:13.881 --> 00:45:15.560
children cook.

557
00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:20.210
Weave cloth and oversee the management of the household.

558
00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:27.620
The only public function of women was an important one in the various rituals

559
00:45:28.831 --> 00:45:31.110
and festivals of the state religion.

560
00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:37.250
There is a very new book by a professor at NYU by the name of Connolly which

561
00:45:38.941 --> 00:45:43.890
studies very carefully all the information that we know about ancient Greek

562
00:45:43.891 --> 00:45:46.620
priestesses at which reveals.

563
00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:51.810
<v 11>I think something that we haven't known enough about before that women is in</v>

564
00:45:51.811 --> 00:45:55.320
that realm at least had an enormously important.

565
00:45:55.890 --> 00:46:00.890
And I would say sort of Gloria's role in that way.

566
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:05.280
It doesn't change any of the things I've said about the other aspects of life.

567
00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:10.310
But we we have had we've really not paid enough attention to this religious side

568
00:46:11.371 --> 00:46:14.970
of things and we should remember that religion was very important for these

569
00:46:14.971 --> 00:46:19.440
people even though to us it looks as though they were very secular in the way

570
00:46:19.441 --> 00:46:23.250
they lived religion and their way of thinking was very important.

571
00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:28.310
So anyway apart from these religious things Athenian women were expected to

572
00:46:29.901 --> 00:46:32.420
remain home quiet and unnoticed.

573
00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:38.680
<v 2>Pericles told the widows and mothers of the Athenian men who died in the first</v>

574
00:46:38.811 --> 00:46:41.840
year of the Peloponnesian War.
Only this.

575
00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:46.980
Know you will either have read or you will read Pericles famous funeral oration.

576
00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:54.410
And he has all these things to say and at the very end he addresses the widows

577
00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:59.500
and the mothers of the men who have died in a way that puzzles me beyond belief.

578
00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:06.830
And I still don't understand why he chose to say what he did but what he said I

579
00:47:06.831 --> 00:47:11.390
think was the common wisdom about what the situation was.
He said.

580
00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:17.110
Your great glory is not to fall short of your natural character and the greatest

581
00:47:19.761 --> 00:47:24.761
glory of women is to be least talked about by men.

582
00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:30.110
Whether for good or ill
OK.

583
00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:32.220
I.
That's what they thought.

584
00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:37.500
Why the hell did he say it at the end of that fuel oration if anybody has any

585
00:47:37.501 --> 00:47:40.770
insight on that.
I would be very grateful if you would tell me about it.

586
00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:42.960
Not now or at any time in the future.

587
00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:49.670
The picture derived from these sources is largely accurate but I would argue

588
00:47:50.401 --> 00:47:52.080
that it does not fit in well.

589
00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:57.720
With what we learn from the evidence of a wholly different set of sources.

590
00:47:57.990 --> 00:48:02.990
First of all what we see in the pictorial art chiefly on these invasive

591
00:48:05.041 --> 00:48:10.041
paintings and even more strikingly I think in what we learn from the tragedies

592
00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:17.370
and the comedies that were performed every year at two great festivals in
Athens.

593
00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:23.120
And finally these things are derived very much from the mythology which is after

594
00:48:24.061 --> 00:48:27.870
all their religious tradition of the Athenians.

595
00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:33.920
Now these sources often show women as central characters and powerful figures in

596
00:48:36.951 --> 00:48:41.951
both the public and the private spheres the climate of mistrust who shows up in

597
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:47.750
Aeschylus as tragedy Agamemnon she arranges the murder of her royal husband and

598
00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:55.670
establishes the tyranny of her lover whom she dominates.

599
00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:03.020
<v 7>Then there is the terrifying and powerful media of Euripides who negotiates with</v>

600
00:49:05.371 --> 00:49:10.371
kings and can commit horrible deeds in her fury which I think your reporting

601
00:49:13.561 --> 00:49:18.561
suggests is very justified fury even if the deed is not so we are and these are

602
00:49:20.631 --> 00:49:25.631
just two two examples of which there are many in which women are central and

603
00:49:26.071 --> 00:49:30.210
important and powerful and active and not passive.
And it's all about them.

604
00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:35.970
We are left with an apparent contradiction clearly revealed by a famous speech

605
00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.970
and you repeat his tragedy media and I'd like to.

606
00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:45.530
Read you that he presented his play at the diagnostic festival in Athens.

607
00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:50.190
His heroine Madea is a foreign woman.

608
00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:52.860
Who has unusual powers.

609
00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:58.490
I mean she is practically something like a witch a sorceress don't imagine these

610
00:49:58.581 --> 00:50:03.290
Halloween kind of witches a proper which is so beautiful that she can be which

611
00:50:03.291 --> 00:50:07.260
you think of them.
So.

612
00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:11.840
<v 2>She is a farm one with these powers but in a speech that follows.</v>

613
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:16.870
She describes the fate of women in terms that appear to give an accurate account

614
00:50:17.121 --> 00:50:20.090
of the condition of women in fifth century B.C. Athens.

615
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:25.320
Here's what she says of all things which are living and can form a judgment.

616
00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:31.010
We women are the most unfortunate creatures firstly with an excess of wealth.

617
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:38.750
It is required for us to buy a husband and take for our bodies a master for not

618
00:50:41.401 --> 00:50:46.401
to take one is even worse and now the question is serious whether we take a good

619
00:50:48.201 --> 00:50:49.034
or bad one.

620
00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:54.600
For there is no easy escape for a woman nor can she say no to her marriage she

621
00:50:56.391 --> 00:51:01.391
arrives among new modes of behavior and manners and she needs prophetic power

622
00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:08.390
unless she has learned at home how best to manage him who shares the bed with

623
00:51:08.701 --> 00:51:13.701
her and if we work out all this well and carefully and the husband lives with us

624
00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:19.700
and lightly bears his yoke.
This life is enviable.

625
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:25.390
If not I'd rather die a man when he's tired of the company this home goes out of

626
00:51:28.311 --> 00:51:33.170
the house and puts an end to his boredom and turns to a friend or companion of

627
00:51:33.171 --> 00:51:34.004
his own age.

628
00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:39.700
But we are forced to keep our eyes on one alone what they say of us is that we

629
00:51:41.661 --> 00:51:46.040
have a peaceful time living at home while they do the fighting in war.

630
00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:49.160
How wrong they are.

631
00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:55.060
I would very much rather stand three times in the front of battle than to bear

632
00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:58.360
one child.

633
00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:05.470
<v 7>I wonder what the Athenian men in that audience thought about all of that.</v>

634
00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:11.380
The picture that Medea paints of women subjected to men accords well of course

635
00:52:11.571 --> 00:52:12.890
with much of the evidence.

636
00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:17.920
But we have to take note of the fact that the woman who complains of women's lot

637
00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:24.160
is the powerful central figure in a tragedy that is named after her.

638
00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:25.940
By the way it's not the only case.

639
00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:31.540
Another of the great tragedies of addict drama is Sophocles and Tiffany and then

640
00:52:34.521 --> 00:52:39.521
taking he is another heroic woman who defies kings and everybody else in order

641
00:52:41.301 --> 00:52:43.640
to do the right thing and who accepts death.

642
00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.190
Rather than to give way in her principles.

643
00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:51.230
This is not the kind of a woman that Pericles had in mind when he said just shut

644
00:52:51.231 --> 00:52:55.210
up and be sure nobody is talking about you.
Now this.

645
00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.090
Tragedy was produced.

646
00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:03.180
We need to remember at state expense before most of the Athenian population and

647
00:53:04.421 --> 00:53:06.000
was written by a man.

648
00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:12.010
Who was one of Athens greatest poets and dramatists media is a cause of terror

649
00:53:12.481 --> 00:53:17.481
to the audience and at the same time an object of their pity and sympathy as a

650
00:53:18.751 --> 00:53:19.950
victim of injustice.

651
00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:24.990
She is anything but the creature least talked about by men whether for good or

652
00:53:24.991 --> 00:53:25.824
for bad.

653
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:29.970
When those men walked out of that theater they would be talking about media for

654
00:53:29.971 --> 00:53:30.804
the next week.

655
00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:36.990
There is reason to believe that the role played by Athenian women may have been

656
00:53:37.781 --> 00:53:42.220
more complex than their legal status might suggest.

657
00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:47.080
And that's all I feel I can say about that subject because I haven't been able

658
00:53:47.081 --> 00:53:51.890
to resolve the contradiction
most.
Yeah.

659
00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.460
I mean well I won't.

660
00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:56.880
I won't go into modern scholarly arguments but let me just say that no matter

661
00:53:56.881 --> 00:54:01.881
what they all say no matter how they come out this dichotomy is there.

662
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:06.840
It's in the sources we need to do some thinking in some supplying for things

663
00:54:06.841 --> 00:54:07.674
that are missing.

664
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:12.950
If we are to comprehend how both halves of this can be true as I'm sure they

665
00:54:13.201 --> 00:54:14.310
both are somehow

666
00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:18.340
let's turn next to the question of slavery.

667
00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:24.570
<v 2>In Greece chattel slavery proper began to increase about 500 B.C. and it</v>

668
00:54:27.701 --> 00:54:30.310
remained an important element in society.

669
00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:35.010
The main sources of slaves were war captives.

670
00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:40.700
And the captives of pirates who made a living in large part by catching people

671
00:54:41.071 --> 00:54:42.070
and selling them as slaves.

672
00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:48.490
And of course those people at first enslaved through war piracy or other means

673
00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:52.160
who were sold by slave traders.

674
00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:57.500
They did not unlike in the American South.

675
00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:02.800
Were they successful or necessarily did they try to breed slaves themselves they

676
00:55:03.891 --> 00:55:06.160
were typically bought from slave traders

677
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:13.000
like the Chinese the Egyptians and almost every other civilized people in the

678
00:55:14.121 --> 00:55:14.954
ancient world.

679
00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:20.800
The Greeks regarded foreigners as inferiors they call them barbarians because

680
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:27.090
they uttered words that sounded to the Greeks like bah bah bah bah bah

681
00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:33.590
and most slaves working for the Greeks were foreigners Greek sometimes enslaved

682
00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:39.900
Greeks but typically not to serve in the Greek home as a servant or

683
00:55:43.450 --> 00:55:47.560
even in a debt really not so much at home.

684
00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:52.630
They did use slaves as I've told you earlier to work on the farms alongside the

685
00:55:52.631 --> 00:55:53.464
farmers.

686
00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:59.200
The chief occupation as always before the 20th century was agriculture the great

687
00:56:01.511 --> 00:56:06.511
majority of Greek farmers work these small holdings too poor to support even one

688
00:56:07.211 --> 00:56:08.044
slave.

689
00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:13.770
Some would be so fortunate as to have as many as one or two slaves to work

690
00:56:13.771 --> 00:56:14.604
alongside.

691
00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:20.220
I think as I said earlier I think probably most of the hot lights could manage

692
00:56:20.221 --> 00:56:22.860
that but I think we don't we really don't know the answer to that.

693
00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:27.630
I'm sure they range from zero to more than two but if you're thinking one or two

694
00:56:27.631 --> 00:56:28.650
you're probably right.

695
00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:34.290
The upper classes had larger farms of course that would be let out to free

696
00:56:34.291 --> 00:56:39.291
tenant farmers or worked by slaves generally under an overseer who was himself a

697
00:56:40.441 --> 00:56:41.274
slave.

698
00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:47.200
<v 11>Large landowners generally did not have one single great state in every way I</v>

699
00:56:47.751 --> 00:56:49.580
want you to try to get out of your head.

700
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.860
<v 7>The picture of slavery in the American South with its plantations and great</v>

701
00:56:55.100 --> 00:57:00.100
squads of slaves in one place under one master that it was not the typical way

702
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:07.700
for the Greeks but rather the wealthy would have several smaller farms scattered

703
00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:09.290
about the polls.

704
00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:14.900
Well that arrangement did not encourage the amassing of these great hordes of

705
00:57:14.901 --> 00:57:19.640
agricultural slaves who would later work the cotton and sugar plantations of the

706
00:57:19.641 --> 00:57:20.474
new world.

707
00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:26.440
Slaves were used in larger numbers in what I laughingly call industry in the

708
00:57:26.541 --> 00:57:31.541
ancient world I mean handicrafts but one exception to that typical system was

709
00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:34.233
mining.

710
00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:39.690
We know something about the mines in southern Athens where the silver was found

711
00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:43.660
and that reveals a different picture.

712
00:57:45.050 --> 00:57:50.050
Nick is a wealthy Athenian of the fifth century B.C. owned a thousand slaves

713
00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:57.370
whom he rented to a mining contractor for a profit.

714
00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:01.450
But this is actually this is unique.

715
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:06.510
We don't know of anything like this besides this situation and it's by far the

716
00:58:06.971 --> 00:58:11.971
largest number of slaves that we know any individual hill in another instance of

717
00:58:13.021 --> 00:58:18.021
large slave holdings in Athens a family of resident aliens employed about a

718
00:58:19.411 --> 00:58:23.770
hundred and twenty slaves in their shield factory.

719
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:27.630
That was the military industrial complex in Athens.

720
00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:33.960
Most manufacturing however was at very small scale with shops using one or two

721
00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:40.800
or a handful of slaves slaves worked as craftsmen in almost every trade and it

722
00:58:43.221 --> 00:58:46.880
was true for the agricultural slaves on small farms.

723
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:49.640
They worked alongside their masters

724
00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:55.720
if you took these slaves that I regard as taking care of the majority of the

725
00:58:55.721 --> 00:58:56.980
work in Athens.

726
00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:03.060
If you transfer later them into being handy men or regular workers who worked at

727
00:59:03.641 --> 00:59:05.410
jobs regularly who were free.

728
00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:09.580
<v 11>You would if you went in you wouldn't into these shops.</v>

729
00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:14.620
That's what you would think because you didn't have somebody lashing anybody

730
00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:17.590
over great numbers of people you would have two or three guys working there.

731
00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:20.210
One would be the guy who owns it and the other two guys would be slaves.

732
00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:27.610
A significant proportion of slaves of course were domestic servants and many

733
00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:32.820
were shepherds publicly held slaves also served as policemen.

734
00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:37.760
Don't get carried away.
There were very very few policemen.

735
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:40.400
They were also prison attendants.

736
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:43.310
They were very very few prisoners and very few prisoners.

737
00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:49.220
They were clerks and there were secretaries and some of them worked their way up

738
00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:53.120
because of their natural skills whether if they were in work.

739
00:59:53.410 --> 00:59:54.690
This was usually the case.

740
00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:59.890
If you found such people in commerce and most especially in banking we hear that

741
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:04.520
one of the richest men in Athens in the fourth century was a man called paisan

742
01:00:04.850 --> 01:00:09.850
who had been a slave and by his talents had bought his own freedom and had then

743
01:00:10.521 --> 01:00:14.360
become one of the richest men in Athens.
That's an oddball story.

744
01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:19.100
Don't take that as being very widespread but it shows you one element in the

745
01:00:19.101 --> 01:00:19.934
system.

746
01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:25.190
The number of slaves in ancient Greece is a subject of continuing controversy

747
01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:29.600
and that's because we don't have the kind of evidence to come to a conclusive

748
01:00:29.601 --> 01:00:30.434
answer.

749
01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.820
There are no useful figures for the absolute number of slaves or for their

750
01:00:34.821 --> 01:00:39.821
percentage of the free population in any city except Athens there.

751
01:00:41.290 --> 01:00:45.820
The evidence permits estimates for the slave population in the classical period

752
01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:51.060
by which I mean the 5th and the 4th centuries that ranged from a low of twenty

753
01:00:52.251 --> 01:00:57.251
thousand slaves to a high of about one hundred thousand slaves if we accept the

754
01:01:00.581 --> 01:01:03.040
mean between these extremes.

755
01:01:03.310 --> 01:01:05.540
I love to do that when I don't have any better thing to do.

756
01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:12.140
You come up with sixty thousand slaves now the estimates that are made about the

757
01:01:12.531 --> 01:01:16.130
free population of Athens in the same period at its height.

758
01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:22.600
Some people would say as low as not nobody gets much below 40000 households.

759
01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:28.220
Some want to move it up towards about 60000 households.
What do I come up with.

760
01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:29.390
<v 7>Right.</v>

761
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:34.390
Fifty thousand that would yield a figure of fewer than two slaves per family.

762
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:42.250
It has been estimated that only a quarter to a third of free Athenians owned any

763
01:01:42.771 --> 01:01:43.700
slaves at all.

764
01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:49.700
So the distribution was on what was unequal with most families having no slaves.

765
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:55.270
And some families having many some historians have noted that in the American

766
01:01:56.171 --> 01:02:01.171
South in the period before the Civil War where slaves also made up less than a

767
01:02:01.961 --> 01:02:06.961
third of the total population and three quarters of free Southerners had no

768
01:02:08.621 --> 01:02:09.454
slaves.

769
01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:15.100
The proportion of slaves to free citizens was similar to that in ancient Athens

770
01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:19.040
because slavery was so important to the economy of the South.

771
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:23.540
These historians suggest it may have been equally important and similarly

772
01:02:23.570 --> 01:02:24.403
oppressive.

773
01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:29.650
In ancient Athens I find several problems with this analogy.

774
01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:34.350
For one thing it's important to make a distinction between a world such as the

775
01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:36.990
Cotton States of the American South for a civil war.

776
01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:43.080
Where a single cash crop well suited for exploitation by large groups of slaves

777
01:02:44.770 --> 01:02:49.770
dominates the economy and a society like the one in Athens where the economy was

778
01:02:50.111 --> 01:02:55.111
mixed the crops varied the land and its distribution very poorly suited to

779
01:02:56.951 --> 01:03:01.951
massive slavery another major differences in the likelihood of a slave achieving

780
01:03:03.801 --> 01:03:08.801
freedom the freeing of American slaves although it happened was comparatively

781
01:03:09.271 --> 01:03:12.130
rare but in Greece it was very common.

782
01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:16.860
The most famous example I've told you already about pays you know began as a

783
01:03:16.861 --> 01:03:21.420
bank clerk and his freedom became Athens Rich's banker and then was even

784
01:03:21.421 --> 01:03:25.110
rewarded with Athenian citizenship.
But that's very rare.

785
01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:30.150
On the other hand the acquisition of freedom by slaves was not.

786
01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:36.020
People frequently free their slaves on their own death and often before that for

787
01:03:39.041 --> 01:03:40.500
various reasons.

788
01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:46.460
It's also important to distinguish the American South where the slaves were

789
01:03:46.461 --> 01:03:49.610
distinguished from their masters by skin color.

790
01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:55.570
Where the masters were increasingly hostile to the idea of freeing slaves and in

791
01:03:56.691 --> 01:04:01.691
terror of slave rebellions with a very different society of classical half their

792
01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:09.940
slaves walk the streets with such ease as to offend noblemen who were class

793
01:04:11.631 --> 01:04:12.464
conscious.

794
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:17.750
Plato complain about the Athenian democracy that men and women who have been

795
01:04:17.751 --> 01:04:22.751
sold are no less free than their purchasers and an anonymous writer of the fifth

796
01:04:23.531 --> 01:04:27.400
century was appalled by the behavior of slaves in Athens.

797
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:32.430
He says one may not strike them their nor will a slave.

798
01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:34.300
Step aside for you.

799
01:04:35.090 --> 01:04:38.330
And if it were legal for a free man to strike a slave.

800
01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:43.430
And Athenian would often have been struck under the mistaken impression that he

801
01:04:43.431 --> 01:04:44.264
was a slave.

802
01:04:45.030 --> 01:04:50.030
For the clothing of the common people there is no way superior to that of the

803
01:04:50.311 --> 01:04:54.330
slaves and the resident aliens.
Nor is their appearance.

804
01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:59.820
They allow slaves there to live in luxury and some of them in considerable

805
01:04:59.910 --> 01:05:03.400
magnificence in a state relying on naval power.

806
01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:08.860
It is inevitable that slaves must work for hire so that we may take profits from

807
01:05:08.861 --> 01:05:09.694
what they earn.

808
01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:15.460
While there are rich slaves it is no longer profitable for my slave to be afraid

809
01:05:15.461 --> 01:05:16.294
of you.

810
01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:21.810
In Sparta my slave would be afraid of you but there in Athens if your slave is

811
01:05:22.321 --> 01:05:26.310
afraid of me he will probably spend some of his own money to free himself from

812
01:05:26.311 --> 01:05:31.311
danger this then is why in the matter of free speech we have put slaves and free

813
01:05:33.521 --> 01:05:38.200
men on equal terms.
Now a lot of this is absolute baloney.

814
01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:43.810
This is some right wing character who is just so annoyed with Athenian democracy

815
01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:49.140
that he is making over-the-top statements but it cannot be so far removed from

816
01:05:50.261 --> 01:05:55.090
reality as to be ridiculous.
Or else it wouldn't be in any way persuasive.

817
01:05:55.480 --> 01:06:00.480
So I think we have to imagine slaves moved about Athens with a degree of ease

818
01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:07.200
and security and has as he rightly must rightly be saying you really couldn't

819
01:06:08.141 --> 01:06:13.141
tell a slave from a free man very readily in ancient Athens that all of this is

820
01:06:14.141 --> 01:06:14.974
meant to be.

821
01:06:15.790 --> 01:06:19.210
<v 6>By contrast with the picture of the South</v>

822
01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:28.580
even more remarkable the Athenians were on occasion willing to contemplate the

823
01:06:28.711 --> 01:06:31.590
liberation of all their slaves.

824
01:06:33.350 --> 01:06:36.950
In 4 0 6 their city facing defeat in the Peloponnesian War.

825
01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:42.470
They freed all slaves of military age and granted citizenship to those who rode

826
01:06:44.581 --> 01:06:49.581
the ships that won the battle of Argosy twice more at crucial moments.

827
01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:56.390
Similar proposals were made although without success now during the Civil War

828
01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:03.540
people did suggest to the south that they liberate their slaves and enroll them

829
01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.190
in the Southern army.

830
01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:11.220
And such ideas were always quashed and I think we can read something very

831
01:07:11.501 --> 01:07:15.830
important into the difference between the two situations the southern the

832
01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:19.760
Southerners were afraid to do it because they didn't trust the slaves not to

833
01:07:19.761 --> 01:07:22.420
turn on them and kill them if they were armed.

834
01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:25.970
<v 9>The Athenians just didn't have that fear at all.</v>

835
01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:31.010
<v 5>And I think that's a big story about the difference between the two system</v>

836
01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:37.660
okay.
That's all I have to say about these subjects.

837
01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:41.220
We do have six seven eight minutes I'd be delighted to respond to any comments

838
01:07:41.221 --> 01:07:42.054
or questions.

839
01:07:42.170 --> 01:07:45.930
<v 12>And if you would like to put about any of these topics.</v>

840
01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.193
<v 7>Yes</v>

841
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:54.850
did not fear this life because I think in the first place they they did not

842
01:07:54.851 --> 01:07:59.851
treat them so harshly as to create that kind of absolute hatred that nothing

843
01:08:00.371 --> 01:08:01.780
could take care of.

844
01:08:02.770 --> 01:08:07.770
Second of all I think because the prospect of their liberation being not an out

845
01:08:09.881 --> 01:08:14.881
of the question idea soften the edge between master and slave to a degree where

846
01:08:17.291 --> 01:08:20.650
the Athenians didn't have that sense these people are waiting to kill me.

847
01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:26.680
<v 11>I guess another thing is since so many of them first of all you start with</v>

848
01:08:26.681 --> 01:08:29.500
household slaves.
Well even in the south.

849
01:08:30.190 --> 01:08:33.430
There were very very few household slaves who did not develop.

850
01:08:34.150 --> 01:08:38.290
Friendly and warm feelings towards the people in the house so that takes care of

851
01:08:38.291 --> 01:08:39.760
another situation.

852
01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:43.660
And then there were all these slaves who worked side by side with their master

853
01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:48.250
not as part of a gang under an overseer but as a fellow worker with their

854
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:49.090
farmers.

855
01:08:49.090 --> 01:08:54.090
<v 7>So the whole way of thinking about it I think was so different that we never</v>

856
01:08:54.971 --> 01:08:55.540
hear.

857
01:08:55.540 --> 01:09:00.540
And here's another thing we never hear of a slave rebellion among the polis of

858
01:09:00.551 --> 01:09:01.360
Athens.

859
01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:05.970
<v 12>We do hear of Hell OK rebellions of course it doesn't fit that mold in Sparta</v>

860
01:09:06.130 --> 01:09:09.310
but we never hear of a slave rebellion in spite of all the troubles these towns

861
01:09:09.311 --> 01:09:12.500
and I think those would be the reasons I think us.

862
01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:20.550
<v 8>Well what when they had skills.
This happened in the south too by the way.</v>

863
01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:23.360
Just not to the same extent when they had skills.

864
01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:28.780
It was in the Master's interest to encourage them to do their work to the best

865
01:09:29.391 --> 01:09:30.224
of their ability.

866
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:34.550
<v 13>And so they rewarded them by letting them keep part of the profits of what they</v>

867
01:09:34.551 --> 01:09:35.384
produced.

868
01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:39.590
And it was that of course which allowed some of these people to buy their own

869
01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:43.670
freedom.
It is true that that happened in the south as well.

870
01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:45.790
<v 12>Anything else.
Yes ma'am.</v>

871
01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:54.500
<v 7>It's the answer is I'm sure there must have been runaway slave but it's just a</v>

872
01:09:54.901 --> 01:09:59.310
non issue so far as we can see you know it's the big deal in the south in the

873
01:09:59.311 --> 01:10:04.060
north when fugitive slave laws become a great source of trouble.

874
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:07.620
But I think there was not too much running away of slaves because there really

875
01:10:07.621 --> 01:10:09.300
wasn't any place to run to.

876
01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:12.950
There was no place where there wasn't slavery.

877
01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:17.780
So if an Athenian slave runs to be Osama he's gonna be a big ocean slave.

878
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:21.440
I think that was one of the reasons and they put that together with the rather

879
01:10:21.441 --> 01:10:23.490
gentle arrangements I've described.

880
01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:28.690
The combination I think reduced the problem of runaway slave anything else.

881
01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:31.163
Yes.

882
01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:41.260
The Spartan situation as compared to the Athenian situation.
Night and day.

883
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:46.980
The hell.
I've told you all about it.
You've read all about it and as.

884
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.200
A man leading a rebellion and in spite of the beginning of the fourth century

885
01:10:52.201 --> 01:10:57.201
said about hell lots and other people who were not Sparta gates in in less a

886
01:10:57.751 --> 01:11:02.751
demon they would have gladly eaten the Spartans raw so that's there it is.

887
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:07.450
That's all you need to know about the difference.
Yes.

888
01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:16.313
<v 14>Too badly</v>

889
01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:22.910
I don't know.

890
01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:24.660
<v 13>How does the British system work.
Do they do that.</v>

891
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:30.030
I've told this story to various American lawyers and law professors and I've

892
01:11:30.031 --> 01:11:32.490
been struck by their absolute lack of imagination.

893
01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:37.560
But but apart from when I finally get them to think about these things they tell

894
01:11:37.621 --> 01:11:41.970
me some of them tell me very happily that in some areas we are moving towards

895
01:11:41.971 --> 01:11:43.020
that or we have some of that.

896
01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:48.200
They tell me that in civil cases very often the arrangement that they agree to

897
01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:53.790
is that one side will make one proposal the other will make another proposal and

898
01:11:53.791 --> 01:11:56.880
some arbiter.
Will choose between the two.

899
01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:02.940
But mostly if I speak to especially law professors I I've tried to get them to

900
01:12:02.941 --> 01:12:06.690
think about the advantages and disadvantages of the Athenian system with some

901
01:12:06.691 --> 01:12:11.691
objectivity and I and I say to them you put aside for the moment the question of

902
01:12:12.541 --> 01:12:17.240
whether you think justice is more likely to be arrived at through the Anglo

903
01:12:17.241 --> 01:12:20.620
Saxon system of law or the Athenian system of law.

904
01:12:20.850 --> 01:12:24.210
Because the truth is we don't know whether one way or the other.

905
01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.310
And I found that they can't do it.

906
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:32.010
They're so committed to the conviction that justice is only possible under the

907
01:12:32.011 --> 01:12:37.011
Anglo Saxon system of advocacy and competition and all of those things that they

908
01:12:39.661 --> 01:12:41.550
just won't think about.

909
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.060
<v 7>But you of course although three quarters and you're going to become lawyers</v>

910
01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:45.894
anyway

911
01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:51.230
you're above that you'll be much more judicious in thinking about.

912
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:54.600
Do I have to make an announcement.

913
01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:58.890
<v 13>Yes those of you who were good enough to serve as hub lights in our</v>

914
01:12:58.891 --> 01:12:59.850
demonstration.

915
01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:05.180
It turns out we need for you to say it's okay for your pictures to appear on

916
01:13:05.311 --> 01:13:07.820
these deathless productions that we're engaged in now.

917
01:13:08.490 --> 01:13:12.900
So would you if you could please come up forward and speak with John Lee and

918
01:13:12.901 --> 01:13:14.580
he'll talk to you about what has to happen.

919
01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:15.600
<v 15>Thanks very much.</v>
