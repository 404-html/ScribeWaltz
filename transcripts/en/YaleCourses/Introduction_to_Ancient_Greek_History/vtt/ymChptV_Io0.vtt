1
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.110
We were examining a Sparta,

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.490
they most uh,

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.860
important I think at the early polling,
certainly of the,

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.740
once you get into the seventh and sixth centuries,

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.320
and I was describing the formal constitution of the Spartans,

6
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.210
having mentioned the kings,

7
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.630
two of them and the Garrow Sia,

8
00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:29.631
the Council of elders consisting of 28 elected men over 60 and the two kings to

9
00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:34.140
create a body of 30.

10
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.190
Then there is the Spartan Assembly,

11
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.550
which consists of all the adult male spartan citizens and that as in most

12
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:47.730
states,

13
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.730
it really originated from the idea of having the fighting men participate in

14
00:00:56.041 --> 00:01:01.041
decisions and the kinds of decisions that undoubtedly were the first decisions

15
00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:03.990
the assemblies made.
And in the case of Sparta,

16
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:08.991
I would guess almost the only decisions they made were questions of whether to

17
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:12.270
go to war,
whether to make peace,

18
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.600
whether to make alliances and so forth.

19
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.480
Now it's worth mentioning that that assembly,

20
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.400
you want to distinguish that assembly from what I'll describe shortly about the

21
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.500
Athenian Assembly and this assembly.

22
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.480
It is true that all adult male Spartans were participants.
But,

23
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.240
and let me also say that they came to the meeting dressed in their military

24
00:01:37.771 --> 00:01:38.604
uniform,

25
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.880
apparently including their shields because when a question was put to the

26
00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:45.954
Spartans,

27
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.530
the way they responded was by shouting and banging on their shields were upon

28
00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:55.590
the presiding official.
What,

29
00:01:55.591 --> 00:02:00.060
try to determine which side had the loudest noise.

30
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:04.130
It's like a voice vote in one of our own meetings,

31
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.080
only a little bit more colorful.
And,
um,

32
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.920
and only of course if the,
uh,

33
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.660
presiding official decided that he couldn't tell which side had made the most

34
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:19.470
noise,
would they resort to a separation like,

35
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.670
like the British parliament,
uh,
those in favor over on that side,

36
00:02:23.671 --> 00:02:28.470
those opposed on the other side and he would count and out would come the
result.

37
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.940
It looks as though debates in the assembly,

38
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.990
we're probably infrequent because as best we can figure it out,

39
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.530
we would guess that most issues that came before the assembly,
I mean,

40
00:02:48.531 --> 00:02:52.620
back up and say probably not very many issues came before the assembly.

41
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.700
But those that did,
if there was an agreement,
uh,

42
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.300
on the part of the Garrou Sia and the kings,
in other words,

43
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:06.040
the upper groups in society,
if they agreed there would be no,

44
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.270
no need to go in.
There might be some legal need to go to the assembly,

45
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.260
but there would be no debate and the matter would simply go forward.
However,

46
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.120
some scholars go far too far in suggesting that there never was a debate in the

47
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:23.020
assembly.
There are debates reported to us into acidities,

48
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.990
which make it perfectly clear that they did.

49
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.850
But it is worth pointing out that so far as our information goes,

50
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.160
the only people who spoke at those assemblies with the Kings,

51
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.110
the Gev Rosia,
the um,
or a,

52
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.940
a group of people I haven't mentioned to you yet,
the fours,
the fives,

53
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.840
fours,
I'll describe their situation for you.
But for the moment,

54
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:54.100
they are annually elected officials of the state.
In short,

55
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.340
the average Athenee average spartan did not ever speak in the assembly.

56
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.780
It appears.
So it's not a democratic assembly,

57
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.290
even though every single citizen is there if he wants to be.
And,
um,

58
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.370
so that's part of the mixed and rabbit confusing aspect of the,

59
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.810
uh,
assembling.
Let me turn out to the floors.
These,

60
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.900
according to Spartan tradition were invented somewhat late in the development of

61
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:30.100
the Spartan Constitution.
The word f four comes from the word,

62
00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:34.450
which means to oversee over to yes,
oversee what's going on.

63
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.190
They were in a certain sense,

64
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.750
the overseers and one of their duties was to,
uh,

65
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.250
keep watch on the kings and to see that the kings didn't do anything improper,

66
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.440
illegal irreligious or anything of that kind of a,

67
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.470
and some scholars have focused on that and suggested that at least originally

68
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.800
that was what their main function was to protect the Spartans from excessive

69
00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:05.590
power,
excessive behavior by the kings.
Uh,
and that,

70
00:05:05.591 --> 00:05:10.591
that there sort of watching the king's thing was always there chief function

71
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.360
that I think is not right.

72
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.630
I think by the time the Spartans appear to us in history,

73
00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:20.860
let us say late in the sixth century,
fifth century,
um,

74
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.010
the efforts don't do that.
That's,
I mean they,

75
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.330
they still have to technical constitutional requirement to do that,

76
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.270
but that's not what they're up to when we see them.

77
00:05:31.271 --> 00:05:35.560
They are usually engaged in dealing with foreign policy.

78
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.500
So if a neighboring state wants you to communicate something to the Spartans,

79
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.030
either it might be a offer of an alliance or it might be a,

80
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.320
uh,
uh,
an order to do something or else wore,

81
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:53.920
would follow or an negotiation for peace.
Any of those things.

82
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.400
First they would come to the efforts of which there were five and the efforts

83
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:02.210
would then decide what should be done.

84
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.110
I would say in most cases they would,

85
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.390
unless it was very,
very serious,

86
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:12.290
they would be able to give some sort of answer to it.

87
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.610
But when it involves something fundamental like war and peace or alliances,

88
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.210
then they would have to go to the assembly to get their approval.

89
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.550
But my guess is that it would have been wildly reckless and therefore never done

90
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.400
for the efforts not to go to the Garrow.
See at first,
because the gear was,

91
00:06:33.401 --> 00:06:37.580
Sia,
was by far the most significant,

92
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.680
um,
council in the state most able to,
uh,

93
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:48.130
have the necessary prestige and yet to be small enough truly to discuss what

94
00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:49.611
needed to be done.

95
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:54.410
And since the garrison area included the kings in involved the most important

96
00:06:54.411 --> 00:06:56.960
people in the state.
So if the members want them to do something,

97
00:06:56.961 --> 00:07:01.961
it would be damn foolish not to clear it with the Garcia first.

98
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.470
Although if they wished to be reckless,
they could do otherwise.

99
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.940
Now it's another thing about the efforts is that they're very different.

100
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.840
The people who are elected to the Garrow sia are old men who have proven

101
00:07:14.841 --> 00:07:15.501
themselves.

102
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:20.501
They are truly elected by a process in which their individual qualities are

103
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:25.610
relevant.
And so they have tremendous prestige in the spartan state.

104
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.490
This is not true necessarily.
And the typically of the floors,

105
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:31.520
um,

106
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.520
Aristotle tells us that they in fact were just any Joe Spartan,

107
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.520
that they were ordinary people not distinguished in any way.

108
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.350
And although we don't have a clear picture of the way in which they were chosen,

109
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.930
it is clear that they were,
it was a con,

110
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:56.110
it's looked like it was some kind of a combination of election and sortition

111
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.200
there's a strong element of chance involved in selecting who is going to be the

112
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:03.350
effort.

113
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:08.350
So you must think of them not as distinguished people who have some clout in

114
00:08:08.811 --> 00:08:09.644
their own person,

115
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:14.450
but ordinary people who only achieve what cloud they're going to have by virtue

116
00:08:14.451 --> 00:08:18.590
of being chosen as efforts.
And they're only there for a year.

117
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:21.980
Now the kings are there for life and they get to see is there for life.

118
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.830
And I suppose the council at the assemblies there for life,
but the,

119
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:31.110
the,
uh,
uh,
efforts are only going to be,
um,

120
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.800
efforts for a year and only once in their life.

121
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.440
These are not politically powerful people.

122
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:41.740
I think the idea was to sort of have a representation of the ordinary spartan to

123
00:08:42.381 --> 00:08:46.190
carry on the functions that I have talked about.
On the other hand,

124
00:08:46.191 --> 00:08:51.191
they were given the responsibility of seeing that the kings were in line and

125
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:53.140
they had various,
uh,

126
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:58.360
techniques or various policies and processes which had them make judgements as

127
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:04.380
to whether the kings were doing anything wrong.
And if they did,
they could,

128
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.540
uh,
make that point.

129
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:11.541
They could go to Delphi and ask the God if they were right in thinking something

130
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:17.070
was wrong and if they came back that kings would be put on trial to trial.

131
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.450
The force would be the accusers.
The trial would be held in the Garrow Sia.

132
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.050
And don't imagine that that didn't matter.

133
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:30.320
Kings were brought to trial in this way frequently in the history of Sparta.

134
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:36.170
And very often they were convicted and often exile and in other ways punished.

135
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.470
So there's nothing,

136
00:09:40.471 --> 00:09:44.610
just a theoretical about this capacity to control them.

137
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.220
And something rather important about this accidental element,
uh,

138
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:54.210
and who becomes an effort.
All right?

139
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:59.160
Those are the elements of the Spartan Constitution and I think it's self evident

140
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:04.380
that it deserves the title of a mixed constitution.
At the same time,

141
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.230
you don't want to lose sight of something even more basic than that.

142
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.190
Remember all the Spartiates that there are,

143
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:17.300
whether they are ordinary citizens all the way up through king are a small

144
00:10:18.601 --> 00:10:23.601
minority of all the people who are under the control of the Spartans.

145
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.740
People try to guess from the evidence that we have,

146
00:10:28.741 --> 00:10:33.741
what percentage of the entire population of the Peloponnesus or have their own

147
00:10:34.261 --> 00:10:36.960
part of the Peloponnesus the Spartans work?

148
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:41.990
Well it looks as though the number of helocs may have been something like seven

149
00:10:42.691 --> 00:10:47.691
hell lots to every spartan and then you have to add to that the number of Perio

150
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.710
Khoi who are also not Sparty aids.

151
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.760
So whatever the mixed character of the constitution was.

152
00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.760
When you look at the whole of Laconia and its possessions,

153
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.150
it is very much an oligarchy.

154
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:08.870
And the Spartans normally we'll like to see other states oligarchic Lee govern.

155
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.520
They will not like to see either extreme.

156
00:11:14.521 --> 00:11:19.521
They won't like democracies and they won't like any form of autocracy,

157
00:11:19.801 --> 00:11:24.801
which in Greece typically took the form of tyranny and so the Spartans gain a

158
00:11:25.861 --> 00:11:30.330
reputation of being because they often fight against tyrants.

159
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:34.230
They gained a reputation of being hostile to tyranny,

160
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:39.060
which brings our attention to the subject of foreign policy.

161
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:44.390
Very important for Sparta and for the Greek world because there's,

162
00:11:44.731 --> 00:11:45.780
I think I mentioned before,

163
00:11:45.781 --> 00:11:50.781
the Spartans became the first state to be in command or control or to be the

164
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:55.690
leaders of up coalition of states.

165
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.720
Not for a specific purpose only,

166
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:02.050
but a permanent coalition of states,

167
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:07.590
which the ancient Greeks referred to as the Spartans and their allies,

168
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.580
which modern scholars have come to call the Peloponnesian League and I guess I

169
00:12:14.771 --> 00:12:17.080
will use that term and you'll see it all over the place.

170
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:22.360
It's an inn in precise term because some of the members of the,

171
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.010
of the,
I'm going to,

172
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:29.040
let me say a better term for it would be the Spartan Alliance,

173
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:33.670
which is what pretty much the Greeks called it because not everybody in the

174
00:12:33.671 --> 00:12:38.350
Peloponnese was a member of the Peloponnesian League.
And now,

175
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:43.150
not every member of the league was in the Peloponnesus,
but still,

176
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.200
we all will know what we're talking about when we speak of the Peloponnesian

177
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:47.411
League.
Does.

178
00:12:47.411 --> 00:12:51.220
I shall try to remember to speak of the Spartan alliance most of the time.

179
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:57.640
Well,
how did it come to exist?
Again,
as in most things in Greek history,

180
00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:02.320
Eh,
the beginnings are shrouded in legend and are not absolutely clear,

181
00:13:02.321 --> 00:13:07.321
but perhaps the place to start this to say maybe around 570 BC,

182
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:15.450
the Spartans who had been successful in apparently and turning around to some

183
00:13:18.641 --> 00:13:19.600
considerable degree,

184
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:24.900
their defeat back in the seventh century by fight on August and we're expanding

185
00:13:26.621 --> 00:13:31.621
their influence and power in the Peloponnesus suffered a defeat and the region

186
00:13:32.231 --> 00:13:35.110
of Arcadia to the north of

187
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:40.230
Laconia.
Uh,
that by the way is,

188
00:13:40.231 --> 00:13:42.670
is a mountainous country and it,

189
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.600
and poor typically relatively speaking and um,

190
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:51.220
it provided some of the toughest warriors in the Greek world.

191
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.700
So it's no miracle that the Spartans had a hard time up there.

192
00:13:55.330 --> 00:14:00.330
And it looks as though it's at that point that somebody or somebodies in Sparta

193
00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:02.920
came up with a bright idea,

194
00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:07.980
which changed in that the nature of the Spartan situation.
And also,
uh,

195
00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:11.590
introduce something new into the Greek world.
At the same time,

196
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:13.893
they,

197
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.760
they defeated the town of [inaudible],

198
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:22.510
which is located just to the north of Laconia.

199
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:25.090
It's a very important state for the Spartans,

200
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.880
not just because it's the neighbor right to the north of them,

201
00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:29.560
but because you remember what I told you,

202
00:14:29.561 --> 00:14:33.280
if you want to get to Messina from Sparta,
you can't go across those mountains.

203
00:14:33.281 --> 00:14:37.210
You've got to go up north and then go left,
uh,
go west intimacy.

204
00:14:37.211 --> 00:14:41.050
Enia Teggie is right there where the road turns west.

205
00:14:41.051 --> 00:14:44.440
So its strategic importance is very great.

206
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:50.040
The Spartans got into this war with Ted ship and they gain control of Ted ship

207
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.090
where they,
uh,

208
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:58.120
claimed to have discovered the bones of the great Homeric hero Orestes and

209
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:05.550
taking it away from Tatcha the bones,
I mean,

210
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:08.330
and buried them at Sparta.

211
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:11.661
Also,

212
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:15.740
there was a legend that maybe they propagated that showed up in some poetry.

213
00:15:15.741 --> 00:15:20.741
We have that Agamemnon had moved from his home base in my Sini to Sparta,

214
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:23.990
an attempt,
in other words,

215
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:29.170
to connect these Dorian Spartans with the legends of the great men of the ACC

216
00:15:30.751 --> 00:15:33.260
Ian World described by homer.

217
00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.550
And finally we are told late in the sixth century,

218
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:42.800
King [inaudible] who was one of the aggressive spartan rulers who expanded the

219
00:15:42.801 --> 00:15:45.920
power of Sparta said on one occasion,

220
00:15:45.921 --> 00:15:50.150
I am no Dorian,
I am an a Keyon.

221
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.670
What's this all about?
Well,

222
00:15:52.671 --> 00:15:57.671
it looks like as the Spartans begin to extend this league that I will be telling

223
00:15:57.771 --> 00:15:58.760
you about in a minute,

224
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:03.860
they want to make to reduce the amount of resistance that they're going to get

225
00:16:03.861 --> 00:16:04.670
into.

226
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:09.670
Dorian's versus Akins still seems to have some meaning to the Greeks.

227
00:16:11.001 --> 00:16:14.960
Remember the business about what happened in [inaudible] when the,

228
00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:20.050
the tyrants of sicky on made this sharp distinction in favor of cans against

229
00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:24.050
Dorian's.
It suggests that that uh,

230
00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:28.020
division among the Greek people's hadn't died down yet and that's,

231
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.510
I think that's what's going on here.

232
00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.140
Spartans are trying to claim union with the cans,

233
00:16:33.141 --> 00:16:37.850
not dominance over them.
Anyway.

234
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.233
Um,

235
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.640
nonetheless the spark and start taking on other Greek states trying to establish

236
00:16:43.641 --> 00:16:45.800
that domination and are very successful.

237
00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:50.060
They defeated the powerful and important state of our gos.

238
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.580
They defeated,
uh,
I'm sorry.

239
00:16:52.581 --> 00:16:57.581
And in the process they took away a piece of land that is between their area of

240
00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.760
our ghosts and a Sparta.

241
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:07.030
The name of it is a Chi Noria and took it away and next to to their own state.

242
00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:14.390
That's interesting because the are jives never forgave that and never gave up on

243
00:17:14.391 --> 00:17:16.100
the idea of getting it back.

244
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:20.300
And you find the archives and the Spartans fighting each other at least once a

245
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:24.350
century.
And what they're fighting about is gaining control of [inaudible].
Uh,

246
00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:29.450
it's common people referred to kind area as the Alsace Lorraine of the

247
00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:30.950
Peloponnesus.

248
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:34.910
Everybody who doesn't have it wants it back between these two states.

249
00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.073
Um,

250
00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:42.340
and finally the Spartans also take the island just off the south eastern edge of

251
00:17:43.281 --> 00:17:45.410
the Peloponnesus called Sithrah,

252
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:49.620
which gives them a good strategic base there as well.

253
00:17:49.621 --> 00:17:54.390
So they are expanding.
Now what happens,
I'll,

254
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.810
I'll go back to Teggie of for a moment because that's the first case we hear.

255
00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:02.890
It's the model when they defeat the tensions instead of simply and next thing

256
00:18:03.331 --> 00:18:08.070
their territory subordinating the people are subjecting the people to Spartan

257
00:18:08.071 --> 00:18:10.200
rule.
They do something different.

258
00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:14.490
They offer the tensions and alliance,

259
00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.340
the character of the alliance,

260
00:18:17.341 --> 00:18:22.341
certainly in the full fledged history of the Spartan Alliance.

261
00:18:22.381 --> 00:18:25.110
We can't be sure whether the words,
I'm going to speak to you now,

262
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:30.830
we're all there in the original oath to of the Spartans made their allies swear

263
00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.010
but it was there by the end of the fifth century.
Anyway,

264
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:39.990
I think something like it either was in the Ortho was understood and that is the

265
00:18:39.991 --> 00:18:41.760
state that was defeated,
said,

266
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:46.820
agreed to accept the leadership of Sparta and the word that's involved here is

267
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:53.070
hedging him head Jim,
oh Nia.
And the,
uh,

268
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:58.370
the leader is called a [inaudible] and that is something different from being

269
00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:04.371
your master here at this spot days it's a little bit less or at least you want

270
00:19:04.591 --> 00:19:09.591
it to seem that way and to have the same friends and enemies as the Spartans had

271
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:18.270
and to follow them wherever the Spartans should lead.

272
00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:23.930
A short way of saying it was that they turned their foreign policy over to the

273
00:19:24.301 --> 00:19:27.900
Spartans and um,

274
00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:33.330
accepted their leadership in war.
What do they get?
An exchange one,

275
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.590
the Spartans didn't take away a land their land,
destroy their houses,

276
00:19:37.591 --> 00:19:40.950
make them slaves or anything like that.
Besides that,

277
00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.700
they also,
um,

278
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:49.520
provided them promise them and provided them protection against attack from

279
00:19:50.161 --> 00:19:54.300
somebody else.
When the Peloponnesian League is in place,

280
00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:59.660
one of its consequences for most of the time is the end of warfare between the

281
00:20:01.081 --> 00:20:03.090
states inside the Peloponnesus.

282
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:07.230
At least that was the theoretical situation.
As we shall see,

283
00:20:07.231 --> 00:20:12.210
it will be broken from time to time.
But still it's generally true.

284
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.310
So now what does this mean?

285
00:20:14.311 --> 00:20:18.420
The Spartans have done something that is similar to what the Romans would do

286
00:20:18.421 --> 00:20:22.110
centuries later and it really an enormous achievement if you can do it.

287
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.270
When you conquer people,

288
00:20:24.271 --> 00:20:28.800
one of the problems you have is every state you conquer is potentially a

289
00:20:28.801 --> 00:20:29.634
problem.

290
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:34.290
You have to rule it and that's going to take more soldiers and um,

291
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:37.770
you will have to do something with them.

292
00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:41.970
You acquire responsibilities that are greater than they used to be.

293
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.290
But the point is,
normally you don't gain any fighting men.

294
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:51.900
Spartan way of doing it means you gain more troops for your arm.

295
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:57.370
When the Spartans go to their allies,

296
00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:02.380
they [inaudible] want to go to war.
They tell them,

297
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:07.330
send the your allotment of troops to the place.
We tell you on the day,

298
00:21:07.331 --> 00:21:12.331
we tell him that a lot men could well be two thirds of their arms of their army

299
00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:19.030
and there they will go to where the Spartans want to go and the general of the

300
00:21:19.031 --> 00:21:24.031
army overall will be a spartan and they will be fighting for a spartan purposes,

301
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:29.770
uh,
unless the Spartans have chosen to fight for their allies purposes.

302
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:35.310
But the Spartans now have increased their military strength enormously by the

303
00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:39.250
invention of this new thing,
the Spartan alliance.

304
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:44.850
Now the debate continues to exist as to just what that alliance was really like

305
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:55.830
war the Spartans free to do anything that they liked in foreign affairs or did

306
00:21:58.331 --> 00:22:03.331
they need to have the approval of their allies before going to war?

307
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:07.390
I'm talking now about a constitutional question rather than a reality question

308
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.780
and scholars batted around both ways.

309
00:22:10.781 --> 00:22:15.610
My prejudices are that the league's constitution,

310
00:22:15.611 --> 00:22:19.540
whatever it may have been,
it was less important than reality.

311
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:25.510
That is to say not all states in the spartan alliance with equal,

312
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:31.310
some were large and numerous and strong militarily.

313
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:37.710
Some where some part of that and also wealthy others.

314
00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:41.020
And some were at some distance from Sparta.

315
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.410
Others we're a small,
weak,

316
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:47.740
poor and close to Sparta I would say.

317
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.130
And I think they hid the evidence will support this as a fact.

318
00:22:51.131 --> 00:22:55.330
Whatever the theory may have been that the closer you were to Sparta,

319
00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.880
the smaller you were that week or you were,

320
00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.580
the more you did what the Spartans tones you,

321
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:05.230
how's that for a shock and vice versa.
The stronger,

322
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.980
the more distant,
the wealthier you were,

323
00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.730
the more independent you were of the Spartans.

324
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:15.820
I would say much of the time,

325
00:23:15.821 --> 00:23:19.630
most of the time people did what the Spartans wanted them to do.

326
00:23:19.631 --> 00:23:24.631
But we have many occasions in which states refused to do so and even get in the

327
00:23:24.851 --> 00:23:26.530
way of the Spartans.

328
00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.670
Now I think the Spartans very often when they had to do something called a

329
00:23:30.671 --> 00:23:34.690
meeting of the Spartan alliance,
consulted their allies.

330
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:40.110
But it's not necessarily true that they took a vote as to uh,

331
00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:47.690
what the ally's thought.
Sometimes they did.
I think sometimes they didn't.

332
00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:50.240
It all depended on the situation.

333
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:54.290
If you want your allies to come and fight with you,

334
00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:58.640
it's better to have them do so willingly then under orders.

335
00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.160
And so that we'll explain in my opinion,

336
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:05.910
some of the reasons for calling it a Peloponnesian League meeting.
Uh,

337
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:10.860
not necessarily that they were required to do so.
But I've given you a mixed,

338
00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:14.930
uh,
and rather vague picture.
And I think that's the real picture.

339
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.940
I think you can't be very sure either because he,

340
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:23.600
because evidence doesn't allow us to be sure how the league was supposed to work

341
00:24:23.601 --> 00:24:24.740
and how it really did work.

342
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:29.950
But I also think nobody could tell in advance how it was going to work.

343
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:35.630
Whatever they understood constitution was after all.

344
00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:40.660
One of the most important things that a is involved in membership in the league

345
00:24:41.391 --> 00:24:42.800
is that when the Spartans say,

346
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:46.940
I want you to come and fight with me for these purposes,

347
00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.040
you come and you bring your army to do it.

348
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:54.070
But we have a period in [inaudible] account of the Peloponnesian war in which

349
00:24:54.771 --> 00:24:59.771
important states like Corinth and Thebes among others as simply say no.

350
00:25:00.981 --> 00:25:04.280
And when the Spartans say,
why aren't you doing what you're supposed to do?

351
00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:09.440
They come up with a very nice cock and bull story supported by theoretically

352
00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.680
religious motives.
Why they can't do what they're supposed to do.

353
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.490
And the Spartans have to put up with it.
There's nothing they can do about it.

354
00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:21.970
So I think now that I've mentioned the constitutional technicalities,

355
00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:26.420
I think the real thing to ask in each case is what are the realities of the

356
00:25:26.421 --> 00:25:27.121
situation?

357
00:25:27.121 --> 00:25:31.740
And by which I mean mainly questions of power that determine what's going to

358
00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:36.530
happen.
Alright.
But by the end of the sixth century,

359
00:25:36.531 --> 00:25:41.531
there is this spartan alliance and Sparta alone among the Greek states is a

360
00:25:42.891 --> 00:25:47.300
hidden gem inal power and able to use,
uh,
by Greek standards,

361
00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:52.490
a much vaster military force than the Greeks have ever known.

362
00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:56.480
So that when the Persian wars come upon them,

363
00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:01.250
there will be no hesitation and no doubt Greek league that will fight the

364
00:26:01.251 --> 00:26:05.510
Persians will be led by the Spartans.
And so great.

365
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:10.460
Was there a respect that the in which they were hill,

366
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.100
that not only did they command the army's,

367
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.160
even though they had no navy and no naval tradition,

368
00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:19.100
they were even put in charge of the fleet,

369
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:24.190
although they often had the brains to use other people who had more experience

370
00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:26.390
to do the actual uh,
leading.

371
00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:30.320
But Sparta is in this position and I think that's important.

372
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:37.310
Well,
let's step back a moment and take a look at the Spartan state as we've been

373
00:26:37.311 --> 00:26:42.311
describing it and ask what is it that motivates the Spartans as a state,

374
00:26:44.881 --> 00:26:49.020
first of all,
um,
in its foreign policy,

375
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.950
because as we shall see,

376
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
there's this remarkable thing that even though they are by far the strongest

377
00:26:58.171 --> 00:26:59.820
military force among the Greeks,

378
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:05.060
they are more than usual reluctant to fight and they don't like to fight wars.

379
00:27:07.981 --> 00:27:10.080
If they can avoid them,
especially,

380
00:27:10.081 --> 00:27:14.700
they don't like to go any great distance to fight a war away from home.

381
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
And they don't like to fight for any long period of time if they have to be away

382
00:27:21.211 --> 00:27:22.044
from home.

383
00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:27.320
And the reasons for that are really what I want to make you see at the core of

384
00:27:28.261 --> 00:27:29.940
it all,
according to the acidities,

385
00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:33.540
it was the fear of the headlights.

386
00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:38.340
It's not just that the [inaudible] were so numerous compared to the Spartans,

387
00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:42.000
but I want to remind you again of the,

388
00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:46.740
they're tremendous dissatisfaction with their situation.

389
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.700
Their backs may have been broken,
but their spirits were not.

390
00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:56.090
They always were hoping to have a rebellion in which they could undo this

391
00:27:56.461 --> 00:28:00.900
extraordinarily heavy burden that they carry.
And somehow,

392
00:28:00.901 --> 00:28:03.690
in spite of the hundreds of years in which this has been going on,

393
00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:07.170
they did not lose sight of their nationality,

394
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:12.300
of the fact that they were Messinians and that they were a people and that they

395
00:28:12.301 --> 00:28:16.800
had to throw off spartan controlled of them if they possibly could.

396
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:20.460
And their feeling towards the Spartans were,
as you might expect,

397
00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:23.040
there is a story of a rebellion.

398
00:28:23.041 --> 00:28:25.090
I think I mentioned this to you earlier in the fall,

399
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:29.280
early in the fourth century in Sparta,
somebody is trying to stir up the,
uh,

400
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:34.700
the people against the Spartan government and he mentions to people he's trying

401
00:28:35.071 --> 00:28:37.920
to enlist in his side the headlights.
He says,

402
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:42.420
who would gladly eat the Spartans Ra.

403
00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.330
I think that's what you have to have in your mind.

404
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:49.560
If you want to understand what the Spartans think.
If we take our whole army,

405
00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.500
leave town,
go three days,
March away,

406
00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.870
how do we know we'll find anybody alive when we get back?

407
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:58.710
That's always on their minds and hell up rebellions.

408
00:28:58.711 --> 00:29:02.550
Although they don't take place every day,
take place very sparsely,

409
00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:07.760
but they keep happening so that the fear is never irrational to that is added

410
00:29:10.441 --> 00:29:15.390
the permanent entity of our gos,
which never gives up.

411
00:29:15.391 --> 00:29:20.391
The idea of returning to the great days of fight on with our gos as the dominant

412
00:29:21.031 --> 00:29:22.650
state in the Peloponnesus.

413
00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:27.030
And that means that the Spartans have to be defeated for that to happen.

414
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.870
And so the,
the archives,
uh,
combat the Spartans,

415
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:32.490
time after time,

416
00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:37.260
good stretches in between because the Spartans always beat them and do great

417
00:29:37.261 --> 00:29:41.380
harm so that it takes a long time for them to come back.
But that's,

418
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.500
they're there.
They don't go away.
It's a problem.

419
00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:49.980
So the Spartans of course have a need of a collection of states that stand

420
00:29:52.481 --> 00:29:57.481
between them and their potential enemies of whom the art jives are the most

421
00:29:57.881 --> 00:29:58.714
important.

422
00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:03.700
So you can look at the Peloponnesian League in general as an the way in which

423
00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:08.701
the Spartans dealt with the danger they felt internally and externally.

424
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.470
Another element that the Spartans always worry about.

425
00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.680
Remember why or the Spartan so successful

426
00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:23.380
in numerically,
they aren't many,
uh,

427
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:28.330
enough to actually just defeat anybody by numbers.

428
00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:31.300
It's because they are the best and why are they the best?

429
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:34.630
It's because of this training system,
these values,

430
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:38.530
this way of life that is the purely spartan.
Wait.

431
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:41.530
So there were always,
I would argue,

432
00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:46.560
likely to be a majority at least of Spartans who are suspicious of and hostile

433
00:30:49.361 --> 00:30:53.440
to any kind of change in internally,

434
00:30:53.441 --> 00:30:57.550
certainly and externally because external things have internal implications.

435
00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:02.740
They're always worried about corruption seeping into the spartan system.

436
00:31:02.741 --> 00:31:07.630
Corruption normally has the concept of what money,

437
00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:09.160
wealth behind it.

438
00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:14.640
If money comes into the picture and people start being bought by it,

439
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:19.840
they will cease to be thinking the way good Spartans should think only of the

440
00:31:19.841 --> 00:31:23.650
state,
but they will think of themselves and their wealth and so on.

441
00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:28.660
And another thing that corrupts is the search for power beyond what is

442
00:31:28.661 --> 00:31:30.940
appropriate in the spartan system.

443
00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:35.410
You remember that incredible contradiction where everybody has a similar,

444
00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:40.300
almost an equal,
uh,
but each one is at vying for honor,

445
00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.420
which is not available universally to all.

446
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:48.630
And so that means if you are a conservative spartan and the two words are

447
00:31:48.791 --> 00:31:52.300
practically the same,
you're going to be worrying about that.

448
00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.960
And that leads to conservatism in foreign policy.

449
00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:58.960
War is going,
if you win,

450
00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:03.790
you're going to have booty loot of some kind.
We'll come back into spark.

451
00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:04.751
Moreover,

452
00:32:04.751 --> 00:32:09.280
some people will gain reputations because of their fighting in the battle.

453
00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:14.110
We'll bring them excessive honor will fill their heads with a sense of their own

454
00:32:14.111 --> 00:32:18.790
greatness and again,
threaten the stability of the Spartan state.

455
00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:24.420
So all of that is going to explain why the paradox of the greatest military

456
00:32:25.481 --> 00:32:29.530
power in the Greek world reluctant to fight,
uh,

457
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:34.090
and their power is not used to acquire economic benefits.
Uh,

458
00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:39.120
what they focus on is discipline and the state versus freedom,

459
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.450
individuality,
and even family.

460
00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:48.350
There you have this strange society,

461
00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:53.530
a closed society that does not normally permit people to come and visit Sparta.

462
00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:59.920
And even those that it permits to come to Sparta during one period of the year,

463
00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:04.720
they actually force all farmers out of town and uh,

464
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.890
do whatever strange things they do.

465
00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:11.150
And now when we're talking about the fully developed Spartan state,

466
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:16.450
there are no exercises of the arts such as existed before this system was

467
00:33:16.881 --> 00:33:17.714
created.

468
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:22.220
There are no luxuries legally in Sparta.

469
00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:27.110
There are few creature conference.
Again,

470
00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:32.140
I suspect that some fairly early time there were violations of these things is

471
00:33:32.961 --> 00:33:35.510
individuals who had the power to do so,

472
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:40.550
might well try to enjoy these things in spite of their being barred.

473
00:33:40.551 --> 00:33:44.630
But the main thing is you couldn't,
if you had and you couldn't really show him,

474
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:49.340
you couldn't flaunt it because,
uh,
that would be disastrous.

475
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:54.320
And why?
Because in a way,

476
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:57.980
in necessity becomes a virtue.
We human beings,

477
00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:01.370
that's one of our typical ways of dealing with things.

478
00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:05.320
That is we need to do something.
We have to.

479
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:11.000
And so one way we cope is to then we do it and we say it's the greatest thing in

480
00:34:11.001 --> 00:34:15.020
the world to do and doing anything else has no good.
Uh,

481
00:34:15.021 --> 00:34:16.220
and that's what the Spartans did.

482
00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:21.260
Their way of life was imposed upon them by the decision to maintain their

483
00:34:21.261 --> 00:34:24.290
command of the hell outs.
After that,
it all makes perfect sense.

484
00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:27.230
Look what they had to give up to do it.
They said,

485
00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:31.730
of course we give that out because that's what makes us the great people we are.

486
00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:36.530
And that's the system that was the spartan way of life.

487
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.473
Um,

488
00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:43.600
I would remind you again that even though this is very extreme and other Greek

489
00:34:43.611 --> 00:34:45.020
states are not going to live that way,

490
00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:50.350
they admire it tremendously because it suits the ideology of all police that

491
00:34:51.091 --> 00:34:56.091
subordinates individual family concerns to those of the community at large.

492
00:34:56.871 --> 00:35:01.790
And as I mentioned earlier,
um,
the Utopian philosophers of the fourth century,

493
00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:05.390
Plato being the most striking Aristotle to a lesser degree,

494
00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.750
they had Meyer this,

495
00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:12.770
although they have their own wrinkles about how it's going to be,

496
00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:19.450
nothing could be greater as a contrast to this way of thinking than the way that

497
00:35:22.011 --> 00:35:27.011
the Athenians will develop when they go through their growth as the Polis.

498
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:33.130
And so let's take a look now at athletes to see how they came along.

499
00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:44.483
<v 1>Here we go.</v>

500
00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:46.371
<v 2>Athens,</v>

501
00:35:46.371 --> 00:35:51.371
I hope you'll remember from your maps is located in the south eastern portion of

502
00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:58.540
the Greek peninsula sticks out there into the GNC.

503
00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.100
It's geography.

504
00:36:01.101 --> 00:36:05.780
It's about a thousand square miles is Attica.

505
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:10.010
And the terminology,
I think we talked about it already.
The city is Athens.

506
00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:14.480
The uh,
um,
the,

507
00:36:14.481 --> 00:36:19.310
the region in which they live is Attica.
The people are Athenians.

508
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:21.860
And that's an important point I think I made too,

509
00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:25.670
which is everybody who is a citizen who lives in Attica isn't Athenian.

510
00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:29.900
No matter if he live 65 or 70 miles away from the city,

511
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:31.550
he's still an Athenian.

512
00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:36.970
One of the things they achieve early was the unification of that whole region,

513
00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:40.160
uh,
and make it made it one polis.

514
00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:45.460
Although that certainly doesn't mean that there are no independent villages and

515
00:36:45.711 --> 00:36:50.711
towns in the polis of acids because they certainly are now,

516
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:58.510
Attica was not one of the most desirable,

517
00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:04.580
certainly agriculturally rich areas in Greece.

518
00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:08.900
It was relatively speaking,
rather baron.

519
00:37:08.901 --> 00:37:13.820
Now there are of course a great exceptions.
The central valley,
so to speak,

520
00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:14.870
of Attica,

521
00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:19.970
has the richest soil and in the ancient world it was able to grow the very best

522
00:37:19.971 --> 00:37:21.650
grain,
including wheat.

523
00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:27.160
But very much of the Athenian soil is mountainous and pretty close to Barron so

524
00:37:31.281 --> 00:37:33.710
that you don't have a lot of rich soil.

525
00:37:33.711 --> 00:37:38.000
This is not one of the most admirable places to come.
On the other hand,

526
00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:43.210
it has certain advantages that the Athenians used well to achieve wealth and

527
00:37:43.911 --> 00:37:47.900
power and greatness.
First of all,

528
00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:52.960
it has one splendid harbor up in the north.

529
00:37:53.391 --> 00:37:57.080
Western part of Attica is piracy.

530
00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:02.570
It is the port of a attic of Athens.

531
00:38:02.571 --> 00:38:07.571
Once absence becomes a naval state and it is both spacious,

532
00:38:08.721 --> 00:38:13.721
it has a three nice little harbors and it is very easily defended because these

533
00:38:15.231 --> 00:38:19.220
harbors can be closed off and the tax can be prevented.

534
00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:21.800
So that's one strength.

535
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:25.820
Another is that very rare among Greek states,

536
00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:31.480
Attica contained silver mines in the south of the peninsula.

537
00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:34.970
And that gave the,

538
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:39.280
because these mines were ultimately owned by the state,

539
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:42.940
it gave the state a source of income that was very,

540
00:38:42.941 --> 00:38:47.260
very unusual among the Greek city states.
And will,

541
00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:52.370
the availability of that silver would turn out to be crucial at various moments

542
00:38:52.871 --> 00:38:53.860
in Athenian history.

543
00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:59.290
One reason why the soil wasn't so great for agriculture was at a lot of it is

544
00:38:59.291 --> 00:39:00.460
red clay,

545
00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:05.440
but that turns out to be wonderful for making pottery.

546
00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:10.750
And of course Athenian pottery.
And I'm thinking,
especially about,

547
00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:14.140
uh,
painted pottery fine,

548
00:39:14.141 --> 00:39:18.880
where stuff that is meant for the upper classes,
stuff that you,

549
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:22.660
artists we'll work on that will be exported,

550
00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:26.680
all of that that is made of that great red clay.

551
00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:31.570
The basis for the,
um,
pottery that the Athenians did,

552
00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:37.350
another natural resource of great value and a great blessing to those of us who

553
00:39:37.511 --> 00:39:42.511
can still see the remains of the Athenian experience is the marble that comes

554
00:39:44.471 --> 00:39:48.250
from Mt.
Penn telly,
as the Greeks call it now,
Penn Deli,

555
00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:51.730
Penn telecon as the ancient Greeks called it,
um,

556
00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.200
in the northeast portion of the,
uh,

557
00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:59.080
attic peninsula and it produces,
you can still go see it.

558
00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:02.880
Wonderful,
beautiful,
fine,
green,

559
00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:04.930
white marble.

560
00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:09.130
And that's the stuff that the Parthenon and all the other buildings,

561
00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:14.200
temples on the Acropolis and around Attica was made of.

562
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:18.070
And that enabled the,
uh,

563
00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:23.620
the Athenians to build those temples as few cities could because there it was

564
00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:25.030
sitting in their territory,

565
00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:29.410
not a source of the kind of tremendous expense it would be for other states that

566
00:40:29.411 --> 00:40:33.520
would have to buy it and bring it in.
Now,

567
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:34.510
on the other hand,

568
00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:39.550
Athens was able,
as I told you,

569
00:40:39.551 --> 00:40:43.960
well let's start in the early days to grow wheat and other grains,

570
00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.450
but more to the point,

571
00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:51.780
it was very good for olive trees and for grape vines.

572
00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.400
So as we will see,

573
00:40:54.401 --> 00:40:58.480
when the Spa Athenians begin to exploit all of their land,

574
00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:03.260
not just the bottom land that works for grain,
but also the,
uh,

575
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:07.450
less desirable land and produced wine and olive oil,

576
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:12.510
that was a source of agricultural wealth that would play an important part in

577
00:41:12.701 --> 00:41:15.940
their history.
Now,

578
00:41:15.941 --> 00:41:20.941
their own story about their past was something like this.

579
00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:23.020
They,

580
00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:27.700
unlike the other inhabitants of southern Greece,

581
00:41:27.701 --> 00:41:32.650
according to their story,
never experienced a Dorian invasion.

582
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:34.040
Now the

583
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:39.040
<v 0>Dorians did come down and sort of bang at the door of the Athens Attica,</v>

584
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:46.960
but they were driven off by the Athenians and never made their way into it.

585
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:51.830
So the Athenians claimed that they were in a certain sense,

586
00:41:51.831 --> 00:41:56.590
the purest of the pure Greeks.
And they went to great lengths.

587
00:41:57.230 --> 00:42:02.160
One of his stories,
claims they were,
as the Greek word goes on top,

588
00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:07.100
so no status to say they were,
they sprang from their own soil.

589
00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:08.091
In fact,

590
00:42:08.091 --> 00:42:13.091
they said they were in Attica before the creation of the moon.

591
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:17.330
I guess you don't have to believe that.

592
00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:22.070
But on the other hand it's their picture.
We were always here.

593
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:24.830
The original indigenous people,

594
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:29.300
their tradition and sure this one is surely right,

595
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:32.270
is that at an early time in their history,

596
00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:37.720
they Attica became a refuge for people escaping what they would have regarded as

597
00:42:38.871 --> 00:42:40.730
the Dorian invasion.

598
00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:46.120
And there's no doubt that people from the Peloponnesus in there after the fall

599
00:42:46.461 --> 00:42:49.130
of the Bronze Age,

600
00:42:49.131 --> 00:42:54.131
civilizations did a lot of running away and some of them ran to Attica and what

601
00:42:55.571 --> 00:43:00.571
greeted and settled down there permanently and some of the most important and

602
00:43:00.951 --> 00:43:01.670
um,

603
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:06.670
most hours Socratic Athenians trace their ancestry not to the Athenian.

604
00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:09.740
So were there before the moon was created,

605
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:14.890
but the people who had come in this a flight sometime after the end of the

606
00:43:15.051 --> 00:43:15.884
bronze age,

607
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:24.120
it is a tradition of producing conflict.

608
00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.700
But if producing harmony,

609
00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:32.450
these exiles we are told were brought into the Athenian people and lived among

610
00:43:33.391 --> 00:43:38.310
them as Athenians,
no split,
no division.
Similarly,

611
00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:43.370
there is nothing like the hell on class and Sparta and Athens,

612
00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:45.150
they're on those servers.

613
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:50.510
There is no suppressed population waiting to get at their rulers.

614
00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:56.330
So that there's a kind of a historical good fortune which says Athens is going

615
00:43:57.811 --> 00:44:01.440
to be without internal strife,
I don't mean totally,

616
00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:06.840
but to a great degree compared to their allies,
uh,
to their,

617
00:44:06.841 --> 00:44:09.360
to the other Greek states.
Now,

618
00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:12.930
one important example of what happens in Athens,

619
00:44:12.931 --> 00:44:15.360
it doesn't happen other states is this,

620
00:44:15.361 --> 00:44:20.361
there's a tradition in Athens of an event called Sin Oil Kiz Moss.

621
00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:25.620
It's on the,
uh,
on the site.
So you can look it up,

622
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.830
which means unification.
It really take,
if you take the word,
it means

623
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:34.920
<v 2>the bringing of households together.</v>

624
00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:41.930
There is no set of local rebellions against the major city.

625
00:44:42.811 --> 00:44:44.700
No need to go to war.
Now,

626
00:44:44.701 --> 00:44:49.701
there were obviously at wars back there in the early days of the,

627
00:44:50.491 --> 00:44:55.140
uh,
um,
Paul when the,

628
00:44:55.141 --> 00:44:59.640
uh,
the city of Athens became the dominant city.
But it's,

629
00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:01.080
we know so little about them.

630
00:45:01.081 --> 00:45:03.810
It's as though the memory has been entirely forgotten.

631
00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:09.330
And the picture that is painted is one of,
uh,

632
00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:14.430
everybody sort of happily living together.
Uh,
no,
no conflict.

633
00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:19.940
Compare that to Sparta where it's obvious part of gain control of the

634
00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:24.570
Peloponnesus through war and that many of the people there were very unhappy

635
00:45:24.571 --> 00:45:28.230
with them.
Not to mention the Hellos,
but in neighboring be Osha.

636
00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:31.500
The chief city of Thebes

637
00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:38.780
traditionally was at war trying to subdue the other major cities of be Osha in

638
00:45:42.181 --> 00:45:45.300
order to make themselves the boss.

639
00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:48.990
And they never were fully successful in this.

640
00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:54.330
So be Osha is torn to some degree by this internal conflict,

641
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:59.720
which makes it harder for thieves to achieve the kind of power in its own home

642
00:46:00.541 --> 00:46:03.810
territory that the Athenians are able

643
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.810
<v 1>to achieve.
Um,</v>

644
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:14.430
<v 2>let's take a look at the earliest society of Athens as first we come to know</v>

645
00:46:16.351 --> 00:46:17.184
him.

646
00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:21.520
Warning about this is that the story often comes to us through people like

647
00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:26.670
Aristotle who liked to make things neater,
uh,

648
00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:31.380
and put them in nicely together rather than,
um,

649
00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:35.020
to leave a little bumps or anything like that.

650
00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:41.180
The society we're talking about this earliest society is arrows,

651
00:46:41.181 --> 00:46:43.570
Socratic.
And remember,

652
00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:49.500
it's important to notice the difference between aristocratic and Oligarchic as

653
00:46:49.841 --> 00:46:51.250
Socratic implies rule,

654
00:46:51.251 --> 00:46:56.251
I mean means rule by the best and best in that time means simply best by birth.

655
00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:05.870
<v 1>Just look at it.
Excuse me a second.
No chairs today.
Huh?
Let me,</v>

656
00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:11.790
my back is hurting me.
Let me,
you got care.

657
00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:23.820
Oh,
thanks Chris.
We appreciate that.
Thanks a lot.

658
00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:26.143
Okay,

659
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:31.200
<v 2>I'll try to speak loud.
You can me in the back.
All right,
good.</v>

660
00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:35.540
That's much better.
Um,

661
00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:39.010
it means the best by birth.

662
00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:43.090
And that means if you're going to be in the ruling group and the dominant group

663
00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:44.020
and Aristocrat,

664
00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:49.690
the only way to get there is if your father was an aristocrat.

665
00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:52.450
Doesn't matter how rich you are,

666
00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:56.740
doesn't matter what a magnificent warrior you are.

667
00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:01.660
All that matters is birth.
And that is different from oligarchy,

668
00:48:01.661 --> 00:48:03.820
which gives rule to a few.

669
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:09.270
But that usually means I would say just about every case that wealth plays a

670
00:48:12.191 --> 00:48:17.191
role that you can be one of the few in the ruling group if you're rich enough.

671
00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:22.000
I don't mean that they didn't have aristocrats within an oligarchy.

672
00:48:22.001 --> 00:48:26.340
I'm sure that they did.
It's that that was not the uh,

673
00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:30.220
critical element.
Now also in the Athenian aristocracy,

674
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.520
you can imagine that most aristocrats are rich,

675
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:36.880
but some of them are not.
And uh,

676
00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:39.820
that's the distinction that matters.

677
00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:45.210
And we will come back to that point as we see Athens move out of the

678
00:48:45.311 --> 00:48:50.311
aristocratic condition and into one that is more based on wealth than it is

679
00:48:51.641 --> 00:48:55.480
merely on birth.
Well,

680
00:48:55.540 --> 00:49:00.540
we are told that in the earliest times Athens was divided up the people of

681
00:49:02.711 --> 00:49:07.711
Athens who are divided up into four tribes just as were all the other Ionian

682
00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:14.050
cities.
And the Athenians,

683
00:49:14.051 --> 00:49:15.880
of course we're Ionians.

684
00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:21.420
This is a point worth making because most Ionians lived on the coast of Asia

685
00:49:21.461 --> 00:49:24.190
minor or on the islands of the Aegean.

686
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:27.400
And the Athenians were pretty much,
I'm exaggerating,

687
00:49:27.401 --> 00:49:31.270
but mostly the only Ionians on the mainland.

688
00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:35.980
They sort of were an interesting middling group between the Dorians of the

689
00:49:35.981 --> 00:49:39.460
Peloponnesus and the Greeks of other types elsewhere.

690
00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:44.530
And the Athenians sort of stood between the mainland where they existed with a

691
00:49:44.531 --> 00:49:47.110
boar and the,
uh,

692
00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:50.200
the islands and the across the seas.

693
00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:53.373
Um,

694
00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:58.890
each one of these for traditional tribes contained according to this tradition,

695
00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:07.920
three subdivisions that we'll called frat trees.

696
00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:12.070
Easy way to translate factory is brotherhood.

697
00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:16.600
Notice it's all,
again,
it's about family and birth.

698
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:18.430
You are in a fractory,

699
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:23.630
you're in that frat tree because so was your father and it inherits it.

700
00:50:23.651 --> 00:50:26.350
But these frat trees were very important.

701
00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:31.380
I should have mentioned that the tribes had important religious functions

702
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:38.440
that also the army consisted of four regiments,

703
00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:41.300
one for each tribe.

704
00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:46.160
So these tribes had great reality for the Spartans.

705
00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:50.420
You went not only to the religious festivals of the entire state,

706
00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:54.200
but you went to those only for your fellow tribesmen,

707
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:57.770
which gave you a sense of belonging in that tribe.

708
00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:00.590
And I think that's important.

709
00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:04.880
And the frat trees were smaller versions of the same thing.

710
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:10.430
Frat trees had religious rights of their own and in fact the fracture,

711
00:51:11.101 --> 00:51:12.710
he appears to have been

712
00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:19.360
the unit that really mattered in terms of the place where you sort of

713
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:24.290
established your belonging.
I mean,

714
00:51:24.291 --> 00:51:27.710
if somebody came along to an Athenian in the seventh century and said,

715
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:33.320
you say you're in a Fenian,
how do I know you're an Athenian?
Well,

716
00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:36.020
after you've got through saying,
well,
you can ask my friends,
my neighbors,

717
00:51:36.021 --> 00:51:39.920
he have,
what did they know?
You said,
how would you do it?
Well,

718
00:51:39.921 --> 00:51:44.330
I guess it come down to a meeting of my frat tree.

719
00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:50.050
They will have a record of my being a member of that flattery and that makes me

720
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:56.380
an Athenian.
So that's uh,

721
00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:01.400
the importance of,
uh,
in a way,
uh,
a one part of the importance of the frat tree.

722
00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:03.921
Now the Frat tree,

723
00:52:03.921 --> 00:52:08.921
because it was established by birth and tradition was an aristocratic stronghold

724
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:14.480
everywhere.
You could imagine tribe,
frat tree and so on.

725
00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:20.050
Some aristocratic family or families would have had a leading role by tradition.

726
00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:26.630
The Greek religion didn't have priests but it didn't have a separate priestly

727
00:52:26.631 --> 00:52:29.990
class and during the aristocratic period,

728
00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:32.180
and I would say probably throughout its history,

729
00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:37.310
Athenian religion had the th the priesthoods,

730
00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:42.650
the chief religious places in the state.
We're held by aristocrats,

731
00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:48.340
which in a primitive society in itself gives them tremendous prestige and a lot

732
00:52:48.891 --> 00:52:51.500
of cloud probably,

733
00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:54.170
although I'm not sure we have hard evidence on this.

734
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:59.710
Probably the factories fought side by side in the tribal regiments as well and

735
00:53:01.971 --> 00:53:06.380
of course they would always be commanded by heiress to Craddick leaders.

736
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:15.950
Another way the Athenian people were divided involved names of classes of

737
00:53:17.671 --> 00:53:21.000
people,
and we'll come back to that in another context,
but one class,

738
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:23.850
the highest class in the Iris,

739
00:53:23.851 --> 00:53:27.430
Socratic State Worthy you Patrick [inaudible].

740
00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:30.240
It means the well barn,

741
00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:35.340
the well sire and it turns out that in the early Polis,

742
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:40.910
no surprise they dominated the best farm land they had the chief jobs in

743
00:53:42.391 --> 00:53:43.224
religion.

744
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:48.830
They were the government because as early as we can tell that there was a regime

745
00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:54.120
after the legendary king's are gone,

746
00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:59.930
the number one governmental organization you might call it is the counsel of the

747
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:05.820
Reo.
Pagus gets its name from the place where it meets.

748
00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:09.210
If you look to the west side of the Acropolis,

749
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:12.510
immediately there's a pretty good sized hill,

750
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:17.670
which is the area because the hill of Aries,
the war got there,

751
00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:22.700
the council of the area because MIT and did what it had to do and it's clear

752
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.380
that the members of the area,
because in this earliest stage we're nobleman.

753
00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:32.910
We don't know enough to know whether it was all noblemen or just the leaders of

754
00:54:32.911 --> 00:54:37.590
the clans or whatever,
but that's where decisions were made.

755
00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:42.150
It's important though to realize that in these early days of the Polis they

756
00:54:42.151 --> 00:54:45.720
probably had very little to decide and very little to do.

757
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:49.800
Most of the real life of the,

758
00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:55.010
of the state in the earliest days would have been out in the countryside where

759
00:54:55.111 --> 00:54:57.660
the overwhelming majority of the people lived.

760
00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:02.370
You must imagine that it's as something like nothing like precisely,

761
00:55:02.371 --> 00:55:06.880
but something like the,
a feudal,
uh,

762
00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:11.940
manners that we find in western Europe after the fall of the Roman empire.

763
00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:15.330
These noblemen would typically have heart led,

764
00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:18.900
held a lot of land and have been well to do,

765
00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:23.850
have had all the powers I've described and we'll looked up to and we'll listen

766
00:55:23.851 --> 00:55:24.684
to,

767
00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:29.400
they would have led the military units into battle when that was necessary.

768
00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:35.300
And we know that one of the things that they did was to serve as the source of

769
00:55:35.791 --> 00:55:37.530
justice in the state.

770
00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:41.010
If there was a quarrel between a couple of guys,

771
00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:43.790
they would bring it to a court that you think of easy.
It,

772
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:48.090
his complaints were his,
his noblemen,
his barons were a crooked,

773
00:55:48.450 --> 00:55:52.440
but that doesn't mean they all were in any case,
that's where you went.

774
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:57.950
They settled any disputes that you didn't settle by feud or by some other

775
00:55:58.141 --> 00:55:59.130
primitive technique.

776
00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:04.500
And it was pretty clear that they were,

777
00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:08.010
it was right to have the nobleman do it.
Not just because they're aristocrats,

778
00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:12.330
but because they would know what the law was.

779
00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:18.080
Since there was no writing before the eighth century and it was very rare after

780
00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:19.074
that,

781
00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:23.800
there was nothing like a written law code until the seventh century.

782
00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:27.370
Before that,
if you want to get justice,

783
00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:30.730
you went to a nobleman and if you wanted to go beyond that,

784
00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:34.030
you went to the [inaudible],
which was made of nobleman.

785
00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:38.960
That's the picture in the earliest policies.
Best weekend,
reconstruct it.

786
00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:43.470
Now.

787
00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:47.940
Aristotle tells us that beginning in the early seventh century,

788
00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:53.280
the date he gives us,
we of course we shouldn't put too much credence in it.

789
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:54.390
It's too precise,

790
00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:59.660
but it's six 83 BC is the date he gives us and he tells us in that on that

791
00:57:01.711 --> 00:57:05.100
occasion we are introduced to a new thing,

792
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:10.430
magistrates who are chosen from the aristocracy to do various jobs in the city.

793
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:14.790
In Greek,
in Athens.

794
00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:20.120
The magistrates were called our cons arc,

795
00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:24.750
h.
O.
N.
S.
It means in the most technical sense rulers,

796
00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:28.950
but it means really,
uh,
important magistrates in the state.

797
00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:34.410
One of these was called the war.

798
00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:36.450
Our Con Paula mark,

799
00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:40.650
presumably he led the army.

800
00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:47.620
Next came the art Kahn who was actually the most important art con,

801
00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:53.510
the one who gave his name to the year if they,

802
00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:58.560
I think I mentioned the Greeks did not have a system of dating which has a

803
00:57:59.031 --> 00:58:03.740
starting point.
And so you can say one,
two,
three,
four,
five instead,

804
00:58:03.741 --> 00:58:05.300
like many ancient peoples,

805
00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:09.350
they named the year after the leading our con,

806
00:58:09.351 --> 00:58:11.630
the leading magistrate of the state,

807
00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:14.480
the Mesopotamian cities did the same thing.

808
00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:19.900
So that our con was called the art con upon him was the one who gives his name

809
00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:22.720
to the state.
And uh,

810
00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:26.840
so if you wanted to know when did a thing happen,

811
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:30.830
somebody was saying it was in the art con ship of so and so and so and so.

812
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:32.960
Well you wouldn't have that in your head.

813
00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:37.910
You'd have to go someplace and look it up where there was a list of our cons

814
00:58:38.330 --> 00:58:39.950
anyway.
He was the most important.

815
00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:45.800
A third art con was known as the king,
our con,

816
00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:48.230
the arc cone.
[inaudible].

817
00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:52.730
His responsibilities were mainly religious

818
00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:58.940
and uh,
but I should point out that all the are cons,
whatever else they did,

819
00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:01.970
everyone them also did justice.

820
00:59:01.971 --> 00:59:06.971
That is they had courts to which people could come to get their quarrels

821
00:59:07.070 --> 00:59:10.280
settled.
Sometime after that,

822
00:59:10.281 --> 00:59:13.850
after these three major figures that I have mentioned to you,

823
00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:15.550
there was uh,

824
00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:20.240
established a body of men called Fez Mutha tie.

825
00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:22.640
You'll see on the list of words

826
00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:29.410
which weren't six men whose functions whereas apparently strictly judicial,

827
00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:34.050
they held,
they,
they sort of held,

828
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:39.200
presided over courts that you could go to for a specified pur,

829
00:59:39.290 --> 00:59:44.130
uh,
purposes.
Every one of these nine archives,

830
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:48.920
they are sometimes referred to as the college of nine are cons.

831
00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:52.550
They had a secretary which would have brought them up to 10,

832
00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:54.820
but only nine with true art cons.

833
00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:59.330
They were elected by,
I'm sorry,

834
00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.460
from the aristocracy,

835
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:07.220
by the assembly of all Athenian adult males.
That means,

836
01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:09.173
uh,

837
01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:14.770
mainly not aristocrats they chose from among the aristocrats for these are cons

838
01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:20.260
who served for one year and not again,

839
01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.420
that's a very important concept.

840
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:29.230
Nobody in Athens holes in office at this time where I far as I can tell for any

841
01:00:31.311 --> 01:00:35.230
at any time.
Well,
I back up at this time,
um,

842
01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.400
for more than a year.

843
01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:43.480
The only thing in town that has continuity that can develop power and influence

844
01:00:44.271 --> 01:00:49.271
over a period of time is the council of the area Pikas and that's what

845
01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:52.280
aristocratic and oligarchic regimes do.

846
01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:56.780
They are very nervous about individuals who acquire too much power,

847
01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.580
popularity,
influence,

848
01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:02.150
which will threaten the character of the aristocracy.

849
01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.820
Aristocracies it's,
this may seem funny,

850
01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:08.960
but aristocracies love equality,

851
01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:14.450
equality among aristocrats and then tr tremendous inequality,

852
01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:19.850
uh,
between them and everybody else sort of the way Yalies feel about things.

853
01:01:19.851 --> 01:01:20.684
Really.

854
01:01:21.690 --> 01:01:25.760
Gail is a very nervous about anybody sticking his head up above the crowd

855
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:30.830
because,
you know,
it's like,
uh,
the question always is,
why not me?

856
01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.860
You have high expectations of yourself.

857
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:39.190
And so sometimes unless you're invaded by a later religious ideas that the

858
01:01:40.401 --> 01:01:44.870
Greeks didn't have,
uh,
you're,
you're not humble.
You,

859
01:01:44.871 --> 01:01:49.490
you're vying for honors.
I always see Greeks in front of me when I see Yalies

860
01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:55.640
and aristocratic republic is what we have,

861
01:01:56.210 --> 01:02:01.210
not a monarchy but a republic dominated in so far as it's dominated by anybody

862
01:02:01.791 --> 01:02:06.791
but individually aristocrats by the area office and at some point in the history

863
01:02:07.701 --> 01:02:10.970
of that institution it becomes,

864
01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:16.100
it consists now of men who have been our con the year after there are cons ship,

865
01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:21.860
they automatically go into the area,
ah,

866
01:02:21.861 --> 01:02:25.080
pagus and remain area opera giants for life.

867
01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:30.410
Well that gives the council of the area because even more power because an

868
01:02:31.171 --> 01:02:31.621
influence,

869
01:02:31.621 --> 01:02:36.600
because they consist now exclusively after awhile of people who have been chosen

870
01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:41.700
for their individual qualities to be the leading magistrates in the state.

871
01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:46.760
And now they will oversee what's going on and you can bet they will be looking

872
01:02:47.191 --> 01:02:52.191
very carefully over the shoulders of the aristocratic are cons whenever they are

873
01:02:53.431 --> 01:02:55.830
in power to see that they're not screwing up,

874
01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:59.730
but also to see that they are not getting too mighty and too powerful.

875
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:02.250
The weight of the power of the area,
ah,

876
01:03:02.251 --> 01:03:06.420
pagus must have been enormous in this system.

877
01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:12.260
So the rich and the well born because they are pretty much the same in the early

878
01:03:12.570 --> 01:03:14.490
days of the Polis,

879
01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:19.440
run the state in this official constitutional way.

880
01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:25.380
But I would also remind you that on their estates out there in the country,

881
01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:30.980
they run the thing just as well with the farmers and everybody else out there,

882
01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:35.280
cal telling to them and seeking their favor.

883
01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:39.090
That's the kind of world that we have at the start

884
01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:44.070
and then it comes to Athens as a did to every other Greek state.

885
01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:48.660
Little bit later it looks like in Athens,

886
01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:53.720
all of the change and turmoil that we've seen in our gos in current and other

887
01:03:55.951 --> 01:03:56.784
places,

888
01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:02.700
if we are right in talking about something like a hoplite revolution,

889
01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.670
it occurs in Athens to,

890
01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:11.430
and Athens grows slowly and again late,

891
01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:16.640
but it begins to engage in commerce to a greater degree than before and in

892
01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:21.840
ancient handcrafted manufacturing

893
01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:25.920
and it just as it does elsewhere,

894
01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:31.250
it leads to new wealth and new class distinctions which are now based not on

895
01:04:34.201 --> 01:04:39.000
birth but on wealth.
And we hear new terms,

896
01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:43.290
not all of them knew.
A couple of them knew that come into the picture.

897
01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:48.780
We hear about Athenians divided into different classes.

898
01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:53.100
Excuse me.
One of these you remember was the,
uh,

899
01:04:54.270 --> 01:04:56.580
you patch a dye the wellbore.
And that's the old story.

900
01:04:56.581 --> 01:04:59.310
And there really were only to those who were in those who weren't.

901
01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:04.820
But now we hear about people called hip pace and it means horseman.

902
01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:08.040
Cavalryman well,

903
01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:12.420
you can't own a horse and ride a horse unless you have a lot of money.

904
01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:14.460
Horses are expensive.

905
01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:19.420
So there are rich people who are these carrier?
Well,

906
01:05:19.421 --> 01:05:22.150
if they've had cavalry in the past,
they've always been aristocrats.

907
01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:26.930
But what we'll see in the future is that there will be men who are hip pace,

908
01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:32.280
who are not necessarily aristocrats at the bottom of the barrel.

909
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:37.750
We hear about people called feats,
t.
H.
E.
T.
E.
S.

910
01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.760
They've,
they've always been around.
They are the poor.
They don't own land.

911
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:47.410
They are,
uh,
they live at the mercy of chance.
They work for other people.

912
01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:52.030
They do anything they can to stay alive.
But now comes the new thing.

913
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:56.700
People called zoo get Tai,
z.

914
01:05:56.710 --> 01:06:01.090
E.
U.
G.
I.
T.
A.
I.
What does it mean?

915
01:06:01.091 --> 01:06:03.850
It means yoke fellows.

916
01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:09.190
Now there are two senses of the word yoke that seems to be in evolved in this.

917
01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:14.470
You could say that,
and this is one way that makes sense.

918
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:19.950
These were men who were sufficiently well off that they could own a team of

919
01:06:20.471 --> 01:06:21.160
oxen,

920
01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:26.160
two oxen who are yoked together to pull the plow that would make them

921
01:06:26.830 --> 01:06:29.230
respectably well off farmers.

922
01:06:29.590 --> 01:06:32.950
We are talking about people of the hoplite and class.

923
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:39.510
Another theory is that they were indeed named that because they were hoplites

924
01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:44.890
because they lined up in the Phalanx and they were yolked together,

925
01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:48.820
so to speak,
by their shields touching one another.

926
01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:53.980
It hardly matters which of the stories you prefer or whether you choose both

927
01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:55.360
were talking about the same people.

928
01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:01.080
And that tells us the important fact that this new class of independent family

929
01:07:01.631 --> 01:07:06.631
farmer has arrived in Athens and as in other states is not satisfied with his

930
01:07:08.651 --> 01:07:13.651
position in the state as his own importance to the state becomes greater and

931
01:07:14.021 --> 01:07:18.640
greater.
We will come back to this story when we talk about so long,

932
01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:23.670
but think about these changes is happening as the next change that I want to

933
01:07:24.311 --> 01:07:28.500
tell you about occurs.
Uh,
change,
uh,

934
01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:31.930
that threaten or a change.
It didn't happen,
but if it had,

935
01:07:31.931 --> 01:07:36.730
would it changed the entire course of events according to tradition in the year

936
01:07:36.731 --> 01:07:41.500
six 32 and a fenian nobleman who was,

937
01:07:41.530 --> 01:07:46.530
had become famous because of his victory in an athletic contest and who had

938
01:07:48.221 --> 01:07:53.221
married the daughter of a very wealthy and powerful tyrant in mega right next

939
01:07:55.631 --> 01:07:59.170
door to Attica.
So this guy was a young,

940
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:01.480
big shot of extraordinary,

941
01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:06.700
a character named Kylon attempted a coup d'etat,

942
01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:13.740
trying to establish a tyranny in Athens just as his father in law had

943
01:08:14.051 --> 01:08:18.260
established one in mega.
His father in law's name was Thea journeys.

944
01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.570
Well,
as the story goes,

945
01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:24.470
he tried his best to gain control of the city.

946
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:27.890
What you do in Athens in the early days,
if you want to take control of the city,

947
01:08:28.190 --> 01:08:31.430
is you take an armed force up onto the crop.

948
01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:33.740
The Acropolis sees the Acropolis,

949
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:38.120
make it your fortress and proclaim yourself boss and see if you can make it

950
01:08:38.121 --> 01:08:40.880
stick.
Well,
he couldn't.

951
01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:46.480
He was resisted by enough of his opponents that he was defeated.

952
01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:52.360
The leader of the resistance was the family known as the alk me on a die.

953
01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:59.450
We will hear a lot about them in this course,
but they went up there,

954
01:09:00.050 --> 01:09:05.050
locked up Kylon and his supporters in on the Acropolis in a temple.

955
01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:10.220
You couldn't go in and to the temple for the purpose of killing somebody.

956
01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:14.780
That would be sacrilegious and so they were at a standstill.

957
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:19.400
Still if you're inside that temple in trying to avoid being killed,

958
01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:22.400
you still need food and drink and most important drink.

959
01:09:22.850 --> 01:09:27.140
So how could they manage it?
Well,
they took a cord,

960
01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:28.760
tied it to the temple,

961
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.290
held onto the cord and went down to the well and got their water,

962
01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:38.240
claiming that they were just as sacrosanct as they had been before.

963
01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:42.020
And for a while it worked.
But the Aquion [inaudible],
he said,

964
01:09:42.021 --> 01:09:46.160
Bologna cut the cord killed the colonias.

965
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:50.030
That put an end to the colonian conspiracy,

966
01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:56.000
but it brought something to the Aqua Miana die as well.
A curse.

967
01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:03.380
The alchemy and eds with declared a cursed and driven from the city.

968
01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:06.680
Well,
that's for the time being.

969
01:10:06.681 --> 01:10:10.370
Later on we will see here they're back again and they're very important.

970
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:14.510
But the curse continues to be attached to the family.

971
01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:20.050
And as we get to the last end of the last third of the fifth century and the

972
01:10:20.811 --> 01:10:24.760
Peloponnesian war is about to break out the enemies of Paris,
please,

973
01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:30.010
we'll pull out the curse of the Alcmi on a diet to use against them because his

974
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:35.690
mother was of the alchemy in had family for the moment.

975
01:10:35.691 --> 01:10:40.610
What we're talking about here I think though is here's the first sign that we

976
01:10:40.611 --> 01:10:43.790
see of trouble in paradise.
Nice,
calm,

977
01:10:43.791 --> 01:10:48.791
happy [inaudible] Athens has got trouble right here in river city.

978
01:10:49.401 --> 01:10:54.020
I mean no in athletes.
And
uh,

979
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:59.050
why I think we must imagine that there are the kinds of discontents that we have

980
01:11:00.051 --> 01:11:01.100
been talking about,

981
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:06.140
which find the leader in the form of a man who was an outstanding figure for

982
01:11:06.141 --> 01:11:10.790
some reason,
who was willing to try to establish a tyranny and,

983
01:11:10.791 --> 01:11:11.420
uh,

984
01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:16.420
use armed force to try to achieve their goals that it fails,

985
01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:18.720
I think is an indication that it,

986
01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:24.260
that the same forces haven't reached the power in Athens that they had reached

987
01:11:25.291 --> 01:11:29.970
in Mega,
uh,
current sicky on and places like that.

988
01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:34.020
But it,
it's a warning about troubles ahead.

989
01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:37.980
And I'll turn to those,
uh,
troubles in the next hour.
