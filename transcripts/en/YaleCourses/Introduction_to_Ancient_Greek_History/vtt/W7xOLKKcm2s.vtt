1
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.530
The oath establishing the 30 years peace was worn in the year 45,

2
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.530
four 45 and that leaves,
as we know,

3
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:16.290
of course they didn't uh,

4
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.350
oh about 14 years before the Great Peloponnesian war will break out.

5
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.000
Uh,

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and although we only know a little bit about the events between the two wars,

7
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.640
uh,
what we do know I think is interesting,

8
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:40.641
although not easy to interpret evidence about the character of that piece,

9
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:42.780
which we've been talking about

10
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.640
one way to determine whether the piece was a true piece with a real chance of

11
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.840
lasting and controlling it to national affairs for a good long time for whether

12
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:03.621
it was really a truce that merely interrupted a conclusion to a war that was

13
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:05.340
inevitable.

14
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.850
I think that can be tested to some degree by the events that took place in those

15
00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:13.320
14 years or so.

16
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.910
I think we can be one critical question of course,

17
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:21.390
is a quite apart from the objective elements of the piece,

18
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.970
maybe more important than those are the intentions of the two sides.

19
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.860
And I think it is perfect.

20
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.420
It is possible to arrive at some sense of what that those intentions were.

21
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.340
There is little doubt that Paris [inaudible] still in the position of the

22
00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:41.700
leading politician in Athens.

23
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.200
Clearly the man who was the,
uh,

24
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.720
I think the,
the negotiator for peace on the Athenians side,

25
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.150
if I'm right about his invention of the arbitration clause,
um,

26
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.710
that would suggest he was very much personally involved in shaping the character

27
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:02.544
of that piece.

28
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.510
It seems plain that he really was sincerely committed to a policy of preserving

29
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:14.310
peace for the future,
for as far as it could possibly go.

30
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.840
One reason is that several years before the peace and d before this war had

31
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:24.030
broken out,

32
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.910
the Athenians had made a piece with the king of Persia.

33
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.350
The negotiator on the Athenian side was a man named Cali ass.

34
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.070
And so it goes down in the book,
says the peace of Calculus.

35
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.090
This is about as debated as subject as there is in the history of ancient

36
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:49.290
Greece.
Was there really a piece of [inaudible] or not?

37
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.970
Was it a formal piece or not?
Even in ancient times.

38
00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:58.950
Some writers question whether this was a historical fact.

39
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.090
I won't trouble you with all the arguments both ways,
but let me,

40
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.890
let me indicate my own opinion is that there actually was a formal piece,

41
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.920
but it doesn't matter whether that's true or false because nobody doubts that

42
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:19.381
there was a de facto peace between the Athenians and their allies on the one

43
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:24.460
hand and the Persians for a good long time.

44
00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:29.461
And that it is not broken until well into the Great Peloponnesian war.

45
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.780
When in the year for 12,

46
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.860
there is a treaty made between Sparta and Persia,

47
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:38.900
which brings pleasure into the war against the Athenians.

48
00:03:38.901 --> 00:03:43.600
So there's this considerable stretch of time when there is peace with Persia.

49
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.583
<v 1>Now</v>

50
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.760
<v 0>about the same time,
roughly the year,</v>

51
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.740
it's the traditional date for piece of Kelly's is four 49 and about the same

52
00:03:54.741 --> 00:03:58.700
time we are told only by Plutarch's.

53
00:03:58.701 --> 00:04:02.180
So some scholars have question the historicity of this too,

54
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.290
that Pericles has called for a great panhellenic Congress could discuss a

55
00:04:09.201 --> 00:04:12.540
variety of questions,
but one of them was,
uh,

56
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.650
how shall we keep the prem promises we made after the Persian war to rebuild the

57
00:04:20.271 --> 00:04:24.740
temples to the gods that had been destroyed by the Persians in that war?

58
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.940
And how shall we see to the freedom of the seas

59
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.150
<v 1>now?
Um,</v>

60
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.070
<v 0>the question of course,
the,
uh,</v>

61
00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:43.260
the temples of the gods that had been destroyed and the Persian war,

62
00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:48.160
we're essentially all in Attica.
So that here was a,

63
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.280
an occasion wherever the Athenians allegedly or apparently hoping to bring all

64
00:04:53.661 --> 00:04:58.661
the Greeks into the picture to help pay the cost of restoring those temples.

65
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.620
It wasn't as Indians who had benefited from it most,

66
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
but also maintaining the freedom of the seas meant providing for a fleet that

67
00:05:12.711 --> 00:05:16.880
would keep the Persians out and keep pirates out and so on.

68
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.380
You Athenians obviously had that fleet,
the result of having the,

69
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.820
if the Greeks had all in fact participated in this activity,

70
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.390
it would have been a way of legitimizing both the Athenian Empire.

71
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.770
And of course the navy that made it great,

72
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.900
but also it would have legitimized the plan that Pericles had in mind in which

73
00:05:41.901 --> 00:05:46.901
we know he carried out to the best of his ability immediately to rebuild those

74
00:05:48.651 --> 00:05:53.651
temples and indeed to build some new ones as well on the Acropolis and elsewhere

75
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:59.230
in Attica as evidence of the greatness and the glory of Athens.

76
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.760
This building program was going to be at the center of his domestic concerns for

77
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:11.930
the rest of the period,
but talking about he invited all the Greeks,

78
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.790
but as it turned out,

79
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.960
the Spartans and their friends chose not to show up.

80
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.500
You can see why for the reasons that I in fact just given you as to why this

81
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:27.950
would be attractive to Athens.
That's why it would not be attractive to Sparta.

82
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.260
There is some debate.

83
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.320
Did Perricone is ever expect that the Spartans would accept or was this just his

84
00:06:36.561 --> 00:06:41.561
way of making it clear that since the Spartans and the other Greeks would not

85
00:06:43.281 --> 00:06:45.020
participate in these activities,

86
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.850
Athens was right in going about it unilaterally.

87
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.460
One of the things that it would do if the Athenians were now to say,
well,

88
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.610
this at,
when the Spartans didn't show up in their lives,
didn't show up.
He said,

89
00:06:58.611 --> 00:07:01.790
if they won't keep their promises to the gods,
we will.

90
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.660
That provides justification for building the first of the great temples he was

91
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:11.960
going to put up on the Acropolis,
the Parthenon,

92
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.640
which was going to be the great marvel of the Greek world,
uh,
thereafter,

93
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.920
and which was going to be very expensive and which he was going to use league

94
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.880
money for.
This would legitimize it.

95
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.500
He hoped and it would be,
uh,
an argument for doing that as for the,

96
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:31.383
uh,

97
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:36.290
claim that they needed to preserve the freedom of the seas,

98
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:41.590
that would be a legit give legitimacy to the existence of the Athenian,

99
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.850
uh,
of the great fleet of the League,
which was paid for by league money.

100
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.690
In other words,
it would give legitimacy to the Athenian Empire.

101
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.540
No doubt.
He thought that was necessary because having made of either,

102
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.530
that's why I liked the idea that he did make a formal piece with the Persians.

103
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:05.390
But in either case with it being obvious that there would be no more attacks on

104
00:08:05.391 --> 00:08:07.160
the Persians,
that the uh,

105
00:08:07.161 --> 00:08:10.280
and the Persians were out and that they were not a threat anymore.

106
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:15.380
Why should the ally's contribute their ships and money?
And by the way,

107
00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:20.270
by this time,
most of them were not contributing money and the Athenians had ma,

108
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.930
we're manning all of the fleet.
Why should this continue?

109
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.050
If the war with the Persians was over,
Perry,

110
00:08:27.051 --> 00:08:32.030
please never imagined that the Athenians would give up their fleet,

111
00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:34.700
their empire,
the tribute that supported all of that.

112
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:39.230
So he needed to have a reason for doing it.

113
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:44.231
And so my view and that of many other scholars is that the congress decree is,

114
00:08:44.571 --> 00:08:48.830
it is called certainly had that as a motive.
Was He serious?

115
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.880
What would he have done if the Spartans had said,
sure,
we'll do that.

116
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.830
I think he expected that they wouldn't,

117
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.140
but he was prepared to have them do that because if they would,

118
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:02.010
they would contribute the money presumably that was necessary.

119
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:07.370
And they would also grant legitimacy to what the Athenians were doing with their

120
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:09.570
navy at sea.

121
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:15.020
And of course it would be a wonderful situation because it would create a kind

122
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:20.420
of a unity between the two that would help keep wore away and Pericles his plan

123
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.880
for using all of that money from the Treasury for his building program required

124
00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:34.050
piece.
If the Athenians are going to be at war,
that money would not be available.

125
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.410
So for all of these reasons he did what he did.

126
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.850
My guess is he the anticipated the likely outcome and a that,

127
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:46.230
but it doesn't mean that he was unprepared to deal with the situation if it had

128
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:47.190
been otherwise.

129
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:53.180
There I think we see the first bit of evidence that leads to my own opinion that

130
00:09:55.290 --> 00:10:00.290
pair Buckley's was very sincere about preserving the the 30 years peace that he

131
00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:05.490
saw that and hoped it would be the instrument by which there would be,

132
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.181
you know,

133
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:11.181
who can talk about perpetual piece but at least piece for the foreseeable

134
00:10:11.221 --> 00:10:12.054
future.

135
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:17.990
Another event that a much debated one that cast some light on what's going on

136
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.950
occurs in the year four 43

137
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.441
in that year,

138
00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:30.441
the Athenians agreed to help establish a colony in southern Italy.

139
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.920
At a place that they called [inaudible].
Now,

140
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:42.720
there are several things about this colony that are interesting and perhaps,
uh,

141
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:47.190
as,
as interesting as any is that it was different from any other colony we ever

142
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:50.520
heard of in the Greek world before this time.
You know,

143
00:10:50.521 --> 00:10:53.610
the picture of what a typical appboy Kia is light.

144
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:58.850
It is the colony of a city and that city is its mother city.

145
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.890
And you know all about those relationships.

146
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.600
There were rare occasions where a couple of cities might get together and

147
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.840
jointly be the mother's cities of a town,
but that's all.

148
00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:15.740
This colony was established from the first as a Pan Hel linic colony.

149
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:22.740
In other words,
it was not an Athenian Colony,

150
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:27.770
even though the Athenians took the lead in establishing a colony,

151
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.430
even though the Athenians,
uh,

152
00:11:30.431 --> 00:11:35.210
appointed the critical players in establishing the colony,
the founder,

153
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:39.900
the oil kist was an Athenian paraclese sent along,

154
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.100
uh,
the leading sear,

155
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:48.110
the leading religious figure in all of Athens to be a helpful in the founding of

156
00:11:48.661 --> 00:11:51.120
that city.
Uh,
Hurghada tests,

157
00:11:51.121 --> 00:11:55.600
a good friend of [inaudible] who also of course was the father of history,

158
00:11:55.810 --> 00:12:00.280
went out there presumably to be the historian of the new city.

159
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:01.443
Um,

160
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:07.020
what's an epididymus the great city planner of the fifth century BC who was

161
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:13.790
famous.
You might not think this is such a big deal,
but it is.
He,
he,
uh,

162
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:19.020
applied simply right angled streets in founding the new city when of course,

163
00:12:20.471 --> 00:12:23.420
all the old cities had been founded,
as I described,

164
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:28.780
Athens itself with streets that just developed out of old cow paths that just

165
00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:30.070
wound all over the place.

166
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:34.870
So the modern grid structure was the work of Hipaa.
Damos.

167
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.100
Uh,
all of these guys were friends and associates.

168
00:12:39.101 --> 00:12:42.350
Part of the brains trust you might say of,
uh,

169
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:47.730
Athens under paraclese and these guys went out and established the colony of a

170
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.580
3I.
All of these elements are interesting.

171
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.720
Why a panhellenic colony?

172
00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:01.150
Well,
for one thing,
uh,
I should point out too,

173
00:13:01.151 --> 00:13:06.151
that Pericles has had seen to it that the membership of the colony consisted of

174
00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:10.510
people from a variety of places.

175
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:16.210
And it's interesting to point out that although the Athenians had the greatest

176
00:13:16.211 --> 00:13:20.920
single number of people in this new colony,

177
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.390
when that colony's constitution was drawn up,
I forgot,

178
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:29.170
um,
what's the name of the Sophos?

179
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:34.200
The Protagoras laid out the constitution for this a new city.

180
00:13:35.141 --> 00:13:37.090
Again,
he was a friend of Paraclese.

181
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.550
It was divided up into 10 tribes,
just like Athens.
It was a democracy.

182
00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:47.500
The constitution was very much influenced by the Athenian model,
and

183
00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.130
as I say,
one of the 10 tribes,

184
00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:55.810
and remember the 10 tribes have to be equal in order for them to present the

185
00:13:55.811 --> 00:14:00.730
necessary regiments in the army.
Only one 10th of the people were Athenians,

186
00:14:00.731 --> 00:14:02.830
even though there were more Athenians than anybody else.

187
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:07.830
But there were several tribes made up of Peloponnesians,

188
00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.440
not from one particular city,
but all from the Peloponnesus.

189
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:16.510
I make those points because I want to make it clear that if you just look at the

190
00:14:16.511 --> 00:14:18.880
percentage of the population occupied by Athenians,

191
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.240
it will not allow them to dominate the city.

192
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.440
This really is a Pan Helina colony.
Why?

193
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:33.330
My view is that [inaudible] was attempting to make a very significant point

194
00:14:36.941 --> 00:14:37.840
here.
After all this,

195
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:43.050
this colony was established in reaction to a request made by some Italian Greeks

196
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.750
who were having trouble in their own city,
needed to found a new one,

197
00:14:49.751 --> 00:14:54.230
needed more people in order to make it viable.
Went to Spartan.
The Spartan said,

198
00:14:54.231 --> 00:14:57.470
we're not interested.
Went to Athens to the Athenians said,
yes,

199
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.060
we'll help you do this.

200
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:04.450
Now the Athenians could have said no or they could have done the normal thing if

201
00:15:05.751 --> 00:15:09.380
they wanted to say yes,
make it an Athenian colony.

202
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:14.030
Why did they come up with this brand new idea that nobody had ever seen?

203
00:15:14.031 --> 00:15:14.601
In my view,

204
00:15:14.601 --> 00:15:19.601
it was because [inaudible] was glad to have an opportunity to demonstrate

205
00:15:20.391 --> 00:15:25.100
something about Athens intentions now and in the future.

206
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:31.370
That was the best way to advertise the fact that the Athenians were not

207
00:15:31.371 --> 00:15:36.371
interested in expanding their power out to the west because if they had been,

208
00:15:38.631 --> 00:15:40.610
they would have made it an Athenian colony.

209
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:46.930
Other scholars have taken the opposite view and think it is a sign of Athenian

210
00:15:47.451 --> 00:15:48.500
imperial interest,

211
00:15:48.501 --> 00:15:52.010
which would have said practically the day after the treaty was signed,

212
00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.930
Paris Lees and the Athenians were already,
uh,

213
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.480
violating the spirit of that treaty.

214
00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:04.340
But I think that is easily demonstrated to be wrong.

215
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.040
All we have to do it well,
first of all,

216
00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:11.180
what I've done already is to look at the internal character of the state.

217
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.890
And you want to argue that is not the way to start an imperial venture in the

218
00:16:15.891 --> 00:16:18.830
West,
set up a colony that's not your colony.

219
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:24.500
And that has only got a 10th of its population being Athenian.

220
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.920
But other evidence I think makes it all the clearer.

221
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:32.780
Uh,
only a year after the foundation of the city,

222
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:37.340
it went to war against a neighboring town,

223
00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.810
the town of Tara Os,

224
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.890
which became the Roman town of Tarentum modern Toronto.

225
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:50.900
Tal Ross was one of the only spartan colonies.

226
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:57.040
So here you have a spartan colony fighting against and it's [inaudible],

227
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.550
whatever that is.
Imagine for a moment though,

228
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:06.440
it were an Athenian colony as the people of a different view.

229
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.980
Say,
what does Athens do?

230
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:15.260
I think that's really critical.
The answer is nothing.

231
00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:21.540
Tara's defeats Suriani then to rub it in,

232
00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:27.460
they take some of the spoils of victory and place them at the,

233
00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:33.260
uh,
uh,
at Olympia,
whether you were,
the Games are held,

234
00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:37.190
where all the Greeks can come and see in which they boast about their victory

235
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:42.050
over three.
I know what it is he needs to do about all this.
Nothing.

236
00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:47.860
This is not the way to behave if you're planning to start an empire in Sicily

237
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:49.920
and southern Italy.

238
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:55.080
So I think that's a very serious blow to the theory of imperialism out there.

239
00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:01.230
And then a few years down the road,
we get to the year for 34,
three,

240
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:07.490
the crisis which will produce the Great Peloponnesian war has already begun.

241
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:14.750
So everybody is looking ahead to the coming war between Athens and Sparta at

242
00:18:16.801 --> 00:18:20.110
that time.
There is a,
uh,

243
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:23.640
a big argument breaks out within three I,

244
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.510
who's colony are we once again,

245
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.600
a terrific indication that nobody thinks it's an Athenian colony right off the

246
00:18:33.241 --> 00:18:36.480
bat.
Although in the argument the Athenians claim,

247
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.290
well it's in the Athenian colony.
I mean the Athenians in three,

248
00:18:39.291 --> 00:18:42.570
I say we're in an Athenian colony because there are more Athenians than anybody

249
00:18:42.571 --> 00:18:46.380
else upon the Peloponnesian say,
yes,

250
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:47.700
there are more things than anybody else,

251
00:18:47.701 --> 00:18:50.190
but there are more Peloponnesians and there are Athenians.

252
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:54.750
So we are a Peloponnesian colony.
We are a spartan colony.
Well,

253
00:18:54.751 --> 00:18:59.100
they couldn't agree and so they came to the decision that they would allow,

254
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:00.923
um,

255
00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.270
Apollo through his article at Delphi to decide.

256
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:10.790
And then that's an interesting thing to who does the Oracle at Delphi lean

257
00:19:12.331 --> 00:19:15.780
towards?
We've had very clear evidence of it in the four forties.

258
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.970
They are pro Spartans.

259
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:23.630
The Spartans have been the defenders of the priest as against the functions from

260
00:19:24.271 --> 00:19:25.200
the outside.

261
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.420
There's every reason to believe a decision made by the priest of Apollo will

262
00:19:30.421 --> 00:19:34.530
favor Sparta and it,
that's not what happens though.

263
00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:38.190
What the priest says,
you are not an Athenian colony and not a spartan colony.

264
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:43.740
You are,
my colony says Apollo,
very nice way out of the fixed.

265
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.760
But one thing they're not isn't Athenian colony.
Now,

266
00:19:47.761 --> 00:19:50.400
what are those imperialist Athenians do about it?

267
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:55.670
Nothing to my mind that absolutely undercuts any claim that Athenian

268
00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:01.650
imperialism,
the West explains what's going on out there,
but why?

269
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:05.460
What's going on out there old together?
Why did he establish it at all?

270
00:20:05.461 --> 00:20:08.880
Why did these established it in the way that he did and why did he react or not

271
00:20:08.881 --> 00:20:11.100
react in the way that he did?

272
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:17.090
My suggestion for which there is no ancient direct evidence is it was meant

273
00:20:18.711 --> 00:20:23.040
specifically at buy to use a current modern terms.

274
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.680
This was a diplomatic signal.

275
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:31.680
Paraclese wanted the rest of the world and most especially the Spartans in their

276
00:20:31.681 --> 00:20:36.681
palpitation allies to know that Athens did not have ambitions of expanding their

277
00:20:39.271 --> 00:20:42.360
empire onto the mainland or out west.

278
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.080
I think what was understood by the 30 years pieces,

279
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.260
the Athenian Empire as it exists in an editor,
I'm sorry,

280
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:55.030
in the Aegean and its trunk boundaries and to the East in the direction of

281
00:20:55.031 --> 00:20:59.350
Persia,
that's the Athenian sphere of influence.
Again,

282
00:20:59.351 --> 00:21:00.640
to use a modern term,

283
00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:07.140
everything to the west of that these needs are going to stay out of and leave

284
00:21:07.481 --> 00:21:08.314
alone.

285
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:14.070
And my view is [inaudible] delivered that message in his behavior and concerning

286
00:21:15.971 --> 00:21:18.700
theory.
And he would have known,

287
00:21:18.701 --> 00:21:23.701
I believe that the number one state who would be concerned about what was

288
00:21:24.821 --> 00:21:29.821
happening out west would be current because the Corinthian chain of colonies and

289
00:21:32.111 --> 00:21:36.400
the Corinthian major area of commerce was in the West,

290
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:42.190
Italy,
Sicily and such.
And so it was the Corinthians,

291
00:21:42.191 --> 00:21:45.730
I think,
whom to whom he meant to send this message.

292
00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:50.870
And in a little while we'll see how that works out.
Uh,
how that,
uh,

293
00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:52.570
whether it worked or it did not,

294
00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:56.320
but it seems to me that is the only way to understand these events that I have

295
00:21:56.321 --> 00:21:59.410
been putting together.
But having said that,

296
00:21:59.411 --> 00:22:02.500
I remind you that other scholars don't understand it that way.

297
00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:09.770
This takes us to the year for 40,
when another critical event,

298
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:12.170
uh,
tests the piece,

299
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:19.760
the island of Samos is,
has been an oligarchy gray.

300
00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:24.330
It has been one of the biggest states in the empire.

301
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:29.850
It is,
uh,
it has been autonomous.
That is to say it has its own fleet,

302
00:22:29.851 --> 00:22:32.670
its own government,
which is again,
all the Gar kick,
not democratic.

303
00:22:32.671 --> 00:22:36.000
The way most of the states are when the Athenians conquer them.

304
00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:41.040
Uh,
but the,
and in that state,
there was a rebellion.

305
00:22:41.041 --> 00:22:45.480
It comes about because of a quarrel between the Samians an island.

306
00:22:45.481 --> 00:22:50.481
I remind you very close to the coast of Asia minor and the town of my leaders,

307
00:22:51.271 --> 00:22:54.420
that famous city of philosophers,

308
00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:59.990
which is just across from Samos and in between the two on the mainland is a very

309
00:23:01.501 --> 00:23:04.980
small town called Trion.
He,
me and each town,

310
00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:08.730
each one of these states claims,
uh,
priority.

311
00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.500
So it's a classic,

312
00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.810
a quarrel between Greek polies about territory that's between them.

313
00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:20.670
Now this presents a very special problem to the Athenians when you think about

314
00:23:20.671 --> 00:23:23.460
it.
On the one hand,

315
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:28.910
the Athenians hardly want to get into a fight with Samos,

316
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:33.360
an island of great power and importance with whom they have been associated for

317
00:23:33.361 --> 00:23:38.250
a very long time.
On the other hand,
how can the,

318
00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:38.640
uh,

319
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:43.640
had germinal power of an alliance allow the big fish in the alliance to eat the

320
00:23:44.761 --> 00:23:47.870
little fish,
which is what would be happening here.

321
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:50.690
That is an unacceptable,

322
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:53.720
if you're going to have a proper,

323
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:58.730
had germinal relationship with these folks.
So the Athenians tried to,

324
00:23:58.731 --> 00:24:02.210
um,
sort of split the difference as best they could.

325
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:07.510
They offered to serve as arbitrators in this dispute and thereby to avoid war,

326
00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.340
uh,
Samos would not hear of it.

327
00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.630
The same means of course expected to beat my latest and they would have done

328
00:24:17.631 --> 00:24:21.680
that.
They were in the process of doing what they were doing,

329
00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:27.040
asserting true autonomy as against the Athenian version of it in the past.

330
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:32.330
But the Athenians couldn't permit that.
It's again,

331
00:24:32.331 --> 00:24:36.020
one of these confrontations in which each side,

332
00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:39.590
from its own perspective has right on its side.

333
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.920
But these two concepts of right are inevitably in conflict and problems occur.

334
00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:51.390
Well,
the Athenians when they are told that they,
uh,

335
00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:54.300
Samians attorney down the arbitrators and they're fighting against the,

336
00:24:54.301 --> 00:24:55.134
my lesions,

337
00:24:55.670 --> 00:25:00.670
Perricone is immediately puts a fleet together and sales across the sea and puts

338
00:25:01.761 --> 00:25:03.950
down the rebellion by force.

339
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:08.930
And then he takes the steps that the Athenians have typically taken against

340
00:25:08.931 --> 00:25:13.010
rebellious states over the last decades.

341
00:25:13.011 --> 00:25:15.740
That is he establishes a democracy,

342
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:18.350
put an end to the previous regime.

343
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:24.370
He takes hostages from the rebellious aristocrats or all oligarchy and settles

344
00:25:26.031 --> 00:25:30.590
them on a nearby island to be sure that these people will behave.

345
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:32.030
Um,

346
00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:36.770
other than that he imposes on them an easy settlement.

347
00:25:36.771 --> 00:25:39.710
He does not do any great,

348
00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:43.130
just does not do any harm to anybody as an execute anybody.

349
00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:47.360
It doesn't take away people's land,
doesn't to exile all kinds of folks.

350
00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:52.130
He doesn't do that.
Uh,
and so his expectation,

351
00:25:52.131 --> 00:25:57.131
and I guess his hope would have been that that would be that from now on,

352
00:25:57.651 --> 00:26:01.460
saint must would be a democracy and therefore reliable and friendly.

353
00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:04.450
And there would be no further trouble.
The,

354
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:07.550
the hostages would help make that secure.

355
00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.900
But the defeated oligarchs did not accept defeat.

356
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:18.070
They went to the Persian sat trap inland from [inaudible].

357
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:24.400
His name was [inaudible] and asked for his help and he gave it,

358
00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:27.020
he sent a force in.

359
00:26:27.021 --> 00:26:31.130
The first thing they did was to go to the island with the hostages were kept.

360
00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:36.260
Take those hostages back and return them to their friends and families and

361
00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:39.950
thereby took away this restraint against further trouble.

362
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:45.400
And now the Samians overthrew the democratic regime that had just been placed in

363
00:26:46.741 --> 00:26:50.670
power and started a an oligarchic revolution.

364
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.310
Now that's very serious right away,

365
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:58.790
but more serious than that is on the news that this had happened.

366
00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.210
The city of Bizarre Santiam,
which became constant and Opa,

367
00:27:03.211 --> 00:27:04.770
which became Istanbul,

368
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:10.220
located at this vital strategic place on the Bosphorus also rebuild.

369
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.360
We are told later on into cities that at some time,

370
00:27:18.361 --> 00:27:22.050
and he doesn't date it,
uh,
the,
um,

371
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:23.850
island of Middle Ini,

372
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:28.400
another one of these big independent important states with,

373
00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.920
with a navy also,
uh,

374
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.560
was thinking about rebellion.

375
00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:39.890
And I go along with those scholars who suggest this is the time when they were

376
00:27:39.931 --> 00:27:40.860
doing their thinking.

377
00:27:40.861 --> 00:27:45.861
So Athens is suddenly confronted by a danger that they have really not faced

378
00:27:49.261 --> 00:27:51.870
before.
On the one hand,

379
00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:57.050
their empire may be in general rebellion soon if this thing spreads.

380
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.600
Secondly,

381
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:06.350
the Persians have actually taken an aggressive step against the Athenian Empire

382
00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:11.130
by assisting the Samians in their rebellion.

383
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:16.520
Now we don't know and the Athenians couldn't know whether [inaudible] had acted

384
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:22.020
in accordance with the instructions of the great king or at least the wishes of

385
00:28:22.021 --> 00:28:25.470
the great king or he was just running an independent operation.

386
00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.330
The first would be a very,
very serious problem.
Indeed.

387
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.980
It would mean a major threat from Persia.

388
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:36.570
The second would still be moderately serious.
I think we have to,

389
00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:41.810
we can't be sure because there was no time for herself needs to consult the king

390
00:28:42.581 --> 00:28:44.610
and everything's happening.
Bang,
Bang,
Bang,

391
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:49.850
and it takes months to get to a a message back to Susan where the great king

392
00:28:50.311 --> 00:28:50.591
list,

393
00:28:50.591 --> 00:28:55.290
so it's in the first instance with Stephanie's a certainly acting on his own.

394
00:28:55.410 --> 00:29:00.330
The question is,
does he,
does he really know how the king will react or not?

395
00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:05.070
We can only guess about that,
but here we go.
There are two,

396
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:11.900
two parts of the trinity that will mean disaster for athletes.

397
00:29:13.021 --> 00:29:17.160
If we look ahead to the Peloponnesian war and examine,

398
00:29:17.161 --> 00:29:21.060
what was it that defeated Athens and put an end to their empire.

399
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.930
It was the combination of rebellion in the empire,

400
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:28.890
assistance to the rebellions by the Persians.

401
00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.400
And the third critical step of course,

402
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:37.560
was that the Spartans were also in the war and ready to,

403
00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:42.620
and in fact they did invade Attica and against the Athenians on land.

404
00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:48.090
And it's that third critical element that is decisive right now here in four 40

405
00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:57.120
the Spartans call a meeting of the Peloponnesian League to discuss the question

406
00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:04.230
of should we make war on the Athenians at this time?

407
00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:09.940
And that would consist of invading Attica and had they done so we would have

408
00:30:09.941 --> 00:30:11.470
had,
as I say,

409
00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:15.490
what was necessary to defeat Athens in the great war.

410
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:22.170
Now we know later on when the final crisis in four 32 and four 31 33 actually is

411
00:30:24.131 --> 00:30:26.050
when did the speech I'm referring to takes place

412
00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:31.720
a critical part of the story of bringing on that war was the attitude of the

413
00:30:31.721 --> 00:30:33.160
Corinthians.
As we shall see.

414
00:30:33.161 --> 00:30:38.161
The Corinthians in four 30 starting in four 33 at least began agitating for war.

415
00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:42.370
And their agitation,
I will argue,

416
00:30:42.371 --> 00:30:45.130
played a critical role in bringing the Spartans to fight.

417
00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:50.470
What do they do now?
On that occasion when they were,

418
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.210
uh,
on the brink of war,

419
00:30:52.211 --> 00:30:55.900
the Corinthians went to Athens and try to argue the Athenians out of taking

420
00:30:55.901 --> 00:31:00.460
steps that the Corinthians thought would push the war into reality.

421
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:01.960
And they said this,

422
00:31:01.961 --> 00:31:06.961
why when the Samians revolted from you and the other Peloponnesians were divided

423
00:31:07.751 --> 00:31:11.260
in their votes on the question of aiding them,

424
00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:16.030
we on our part did not vote against you.

425
00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.010
On the contrary,

426
00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:23.370
we openly maintain that each one should discipline his own allies without

427
00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:29.890
interference.
Now that's critical.

428
00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:34.920
What they're saying is there would have been an agreement to go and attack

429
00:31:35.651 --> 00:31:39.100
Athens.
We stopped.
It was their assertion.

430
00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:44.830
Now that statement cannot be as simple outright lie cause the Athenians and

431
00:31:44.831 --> 00:31:49.570
everybody else in the Greek world by now would have known what happened in that

432
00:31:49.571 --> 00:31:53.650
meeting.
Possibly they're exaggerating their role,

433
00:31:53.651 --> 00:31:58.651
but what they can not be doing is misrepresenting the position they took against

434
00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:03.850
the war with spark.
My question is,

435
00:32:03.851 --> 00:32:08.470
why were the Corinthians and who are so annoyed by the Athenians?

436
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:13.800
Remember it was there the Athenian alliance with mega against Carnes and about

437
00:32:14.921 --> 00:32:19.780
four 61,
four 60 that started the belt first Peloponnesian war.

438
00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.190
And as the city's tells us,
uh,

439
00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:26.500
was the source of the hatred of the Corinthians for the Athenians.

440
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:31.500
And yet here we are in for 40 and they are making a critical position against

441
00:32:32.441 --> 00:32:36.910
the war.
My answer to that question is thorough AI.

442
00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:43.170
I believe that when Pericles and the Athenians sent that diplomatic message,

443
00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.650
the Corinthians received it,

444
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:50.060
thought they understood it and it changed their policies.

445
00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:54.050
So long as the Athenians stayed out of their bailiwick,

446
00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.500
they were prepared to preserve the peace.

447
00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:02.710
So I think that's a very important story if you agree with that,
uh,

448
00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:07.840
analogy piece was very rigorously tested and for 40 and peace one out over a

449
00:33:12.681 --> 00:33:15.830
tremendous temptation to go to war.

450
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:20.690
That leads me to believe that peace was possible.

451
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:26.320
And I would argue still further that having passed this great crisis,

452
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:30.680
having passed this test,
chances of peace,

453
00:33:30.681 --> 00:33:35.681
we're better than ever because the two sides had acquired reason to trust the

454
00:33:37.821 --> 00:33:42.350
other,
to behave by the rules as they had been established.

455
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:46.790
There is one small point,
but which turns out not to be so small,

456
00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:47.870
which I'll come back to,

457
00:33:47.871 --> 00:33:52.871
which is the Corinthians interpretation of precisely what that piece meant I

458
00:33:55.281 --> 00:34:00.281
think will turn out to be not exactly what the Athenians thought that it meant.

459
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:05.900
And that would be serious when we get down to the final crisis.
But in four 40,

460
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:11.200
my assertion is the same in rebellion demonstrates that war is still not

461
00:34:13.071 --> 00:34:13.904
necessary.

462
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:18.410
What has been established in the minds of both sides.

463
00:34:18.411 --> 00:34:20.930
This I think is perfectly clear,

464
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:25.990
is what we would call in the modern world a balance of power in which the two

465
00:34:26.901 --> 00:34:31.901
sides recognize the other really as equals where each has established a sphere

466
00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:38.300
of influence,
uh,
out of which the other is to stay.

467
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:43.550
And that,
uh,
this is a satisfactory,
the Spartans,
you know,
the,
the,

468
00:34:43.551 --> 00:34:47.990
the issue about the Spartans and the argument about their behavior at this time

469
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.850
comes down to this.

470
00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:56.590
One scholar wants to emphasize the fact that the Ecet Spartans even thought

471
00:34:56.931 --> 00:35:00.080
about going to war against the Athenians.

472
00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.090
And if that hadn't been true,

473
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:05.810
they never would have been a meeting of the Peloponnesian League.
That's true.

474
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:11.600
He takes their decision to call the league as evidence that they had decided to

475
00:35:11.601 --> 00:35:16.220
go to war and were talked out of it by the Corinthians and their allies.

476
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:17.810
That's not the way I see it.

477
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:23.200
I think that the Spartans in for 40 were in the same position they were in,

478
00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:27.380
or I will argue they were in a,
at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war,

479
00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:30.320
divided,
uncertain.

480
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:36.670
The more aggressive Spartans were tempted by the terrific opportunity,

481
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:38.580
the same Ian War presented,

482
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:42.990
the more conservative and traditional Spartans were,
uh,

483
00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:47.820
reluctant to start another big war against the Athenians.

484
00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:53.210
And the Hawks had enough power to compel them to consult their allies.

485
00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:58.410
But how they realized reacted was going to be decisive.

486
00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:01.850
And so I think that,
uh,
my,

487
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:06.860
my reading of it is that the conservative Spartans where normally the majority

488
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:11.580
of the Spartans and it took a very special set of circumstances,

489
00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:16.860
a special set of conditions that to move to Spartans,

490
00:36:16.861 --> 00:36:21.750
to war,
and the Corinthians saw to it that that was not going to happen.

491
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.440
Be warned.
All of this is a matter of interpretation.

492
00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:29.030
There is no certainty about it.
And,
uh,

493
00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:32.610
and through Sydney's himself who I think and most people would agree,

494
00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:37.650
thinks that the wall was going to come anyway regardless.
Uh,

495
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:42.690
he doesn't express opinions about these actions that I'm talking about as to

496
00:36:42.691 --> 00:36:45.450
whether they did or did not influence the course of events.

497
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.750
But we have that evidence and we have to use it and think about it.

498
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.270
My conclusion then is after,
uh,

499
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:57.470
the Athenians are now free to put down the rebellions at Samos and at Byzantium

500
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:05.360
to restore their empire and they will use the remaining years before the final

501
00:37:05.941 --> 00:37:10.710
crisis to strengthen their control of the Aegean Sea.

502
00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:14.340
And if the empire in the east,
again,

503
00:37:14.341 --> 00:37:17.700
some scholars who think the war inevitable,
um,

504
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:22.910
we'll say this strengthening of the empire was in fact itself a growth of

505
00:37:23.641 --> 00:37:28.590
Athenian power.
And that seems to me to be a great stretch of,

506
00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:31.080
of the understanding of that word.
What it is,

507
00:37:31.081 --> 00:37:34.290
is a consolidation of what they already have.

508
00:37:34.291 --> 00:37:38.820
And there is no evidence that the,
uh,

509
00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:42.230
these actions that I'm talking about,
uh,

510
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:44.750
frightened the Spartans are upset them.
And,

511
00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:48.780
and that's worth a lot because we hear plenty of complaints about what the

512
00:37:48.781 --> 00:37:52.710
Athenians are doing in the final crisis.
Uh,
and,

513
00:37:52.711 --> 00:37:56.910
but nobody makes any reference to these events that some scholars think show

514
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:59.100
Athenian,
uh,
growth.

515
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:03.270
So there we are again,

516
00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:05.460
a crisis has been overcome.

517
00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:10.580
My argument is no reason in the world why the two sides should fight each other.

518
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:12.930
And,
uh,

519
00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:18.020
in the absence of some new thing that changes circumstances that brings us down

520
00:38:20.221 --> 00:38:22.050
precisely to the final crisis.

521
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:26.160
So I've been telling you the war is not inevitable.
So now I have to tell Ya,

522
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.770
why did it happen?
And that's what I'll try to do.

523
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:35.750
It starts where the acidities of course shortly begins the story having told you

524
00:38:39.371 --> 00:38:42.880
the story of how Athens came to be an empire,

525
00:38:42.881 --> 00:38:47.500
how Athens and Sparta came to divide grease between them in that first portion

526
00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:49.420
of his history.
In Book One,

527
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:54.580
we get to what I think is a chapter 24 and the first book where he suddenly

528
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.260
moves to where the crisis begins.
And where does it begin?

529
00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:03.070
It begins in a town called Epi dampness,

530
00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:09.360
which is located on the western shore of the Greek peninsula on the Ionian Sea.

531
00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:15.550
It is,
um,
um,
I'm trying to remember what was the,

532
00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.900
Oh yeah,
it was called,
uh,
was it the rock him

533
00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:25.420
Curtis,
is that right?
Yeah.
Can,
uh,
in Roman times it was called to rock him.

534
00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:28.330
It was on,
uh,
an important road system that they had,

535
00:39:28.331 --> 00:39:33.331
but in Greek times it was out nowhere is what I'm trying to suggest to you.

536
00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.590
It was not even on the way to anything very important.

537
00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:42.460
It was,
um,
I always,

538
00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:47.480
I'm reminded of the term that Neville Chamberlain used when suddenly war

539
00:39:49.271 --> 00:39:54.271
threatened about a place in the middle of Europe called Czechoslovakia and

540
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:57.430
Chamberlain set about it,

541
00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:02.350
a place a far away place of which we know nothing.

542
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:07.000
I would have been embarrassed to say that even in 1937

543
00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:12.730
a but it's really something about epidem is,
I mean it's,

544
00:40:12.731 --> 00:40:15.130
it's out way out there in the middle of nowhere.

545
00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:16.990
As far as the Greeks are concerned,

546
00:40:16.991 --> 00:40:21.160
nothing is important about epic dampness itself.

547
00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:26.470
This is one of the many occasions in which great wars start in places that are

548
00:40:26.471 --> 00:40:28.330
inherently insignificant,

549
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:33.550
but certain aspects of the situation make them significant.

550
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:37.870
In this case,
the most important aspect was that Epidem,

551
00:40:37.871 --> 00:40:42.871
this had been founded by a course Syrah,

552
00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:49.010
the modern island of Corfu located not too far to the south of this.

553
00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:50.451
By the way,

554
00:40:50.451 --> 00:40:55.451
I should have told you that the town of ancient epidem this today is in Albania

555
00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:02.740
and it's,
I can't pronounce,
I don't know how,
how Banians pronounced things,

556
00:41:02.741 --> 00:41:07.360
but my best attempt is duress,
but I'm not sure that's right.

557
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:11.820
D U.
R.
R.
E.
S.
Anyway,
um,

558
00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.280
the,
uh,

559
00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:20.130
of course Koreans established the colony there centuries ago,

560
00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:26.490
but of course IRA was a colony itself of currents.

561
00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:32.050
But as I told you early in the semester,
it was a very unusual colony.

562
00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:36.140
It's relations with the mother city where most unusual,
they,

563
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:40.910
a facility's reports that the first trireme battle in all of history was fought

564
00:41:40.911 --> 00:41:44.270
between car and thin core Syrah in the seventh century.

565
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:49.600
And there are repeated wars between current and core Cyra just about one a

566
00:41:49.971 --> 00:41:52.010
century,
sometimes more frequently.

567
00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:58.640
And it's very clear that by the time we are into the fourth thirties,

568
00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:04.800
these two cities hate each other and they hate each other with a traditional

569
00:42:06.561 --> 00:42:10.520
hatred handed on down from century to century.

570
00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:15.590
This is a very critical part of comprehending what takes place here

571
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:20.930
anyway,
sometime maybe around four 36,

572
00:42:20.931 --> 00:42:24.740
a civil war breaks out within the city of epidem.

573
00:42:24.741 --> 00:42:28.520
This in what is not unusual by now in the Greek world,

574
00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:32.210
it's about Democrats versus oligarchs.

575
00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.570
And the a

576
00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:42.230
one side has control of the city.
The other side is driven into exile.

577
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:45.420
The exiles,
uh,

578
00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:49.700
get help from the barbarian tribes in the neighborhood because we're really

579
00:42:49.701 --> 00:42:52.400
talking about the frontier of the Greek world.

580
00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:57.140
They are not surrounded by fellow Greeks.
They are surrounded by non Greeks.

581
00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.560
So,
um,
they're,

582
00:43:00.561 --> 00:43:04.220
they are when the people who are besieged

583
00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:11.010
send a delegation to their mothers city,
of course,

584
00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:16.020
siren asking for help from course Syrah in bringing peace to the city,

585
00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.520
uh,
and in putting an end to the siege,

586
00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:22.010
which they are experiencing it.

587
00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:27.380
Well the course Syrians are not interested.

588
00:43:27.381 --> 00:43:31.780
They're answer is no,
we don't want to help you.
Uh,
there's no evidence.

589
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:36.140
They care about which side wins they are simply being,

590
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:40.340
uh,
they see no point in getting involved themselves.

591
00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.050
And important part of the story of course,

592
00:43:45.051 --> 00:43:50.051
Syrah and its significance in the becoming of the war is that it was neutral

593
00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:54.950
towards everybody.
It was not a part of the Peloponnesian Confederation.

594
00:43:54.951 --> 00:43:59.240
It was not part of the Athenian League and it wasn't associated with anybody

595
00:43:59.241 --> 00:44:00.830
else.
In fact,
it had a reputation,

596
00:44:00.831 --> 00:44:05.831
if you can believe the Corinthians of being terribly uppity and associating with

597
00:44:07.941 --> 00:44:10.120
anybody.
I guess if you ask the course around,

598
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:15.250
he might have used a lot Saul's term for Great Britain late in the 19th century

599
00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:19.580
as enjoying splendid isolation.

600
00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:24.440
It wasn't too many years before Lord Saulsbury and others realized that

601
00:44:24.441 --> 00:44:27.080
isolation wasn't so splendid as they thought.

602
00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:30.950
And so it was with core Syrah.
But for the moment of course,
the,
and saying,

603
00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:35.100
who the hell cares?
Who Wins?
You're stupid civil war.
Take a walk.

604
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:40.190
So they did,
well,
I shouldn't say they took a boat ride.
Uh,

605
00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:42.420
they went to carts.

606
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:47.870
Now this demonstrates an incredibly important principle of human behavior.

607
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:53.280
What do you do if you go to mother and you ask her,

608
00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:58.080
can I have the keys to the car or whatever it is you need.
And she says,
no,

609
00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:01.170
you'll go to grandma.

610
00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:05.520
You know what grandma will say?
Right?

611
00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:09.870
You know the old story about the grandmother who somebody breasts rushes up,

612
00:45:09.871 --> 00:45:11.320
tells the grandmother,
uh,

613
00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:15.270
your grandson has just taken a neighbor's child and throw him out of a third,

614
00:45:15.271 --> 00:45:18.660
thrown him out of a third floor window.
Grandmother says,

615
00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:20.820
blessons such strong hands.

616
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:26.880
So,
uh,

617
00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:30.840
the Corinthians react as grandmother Mike,

618
00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:37.070
that is to say they agree to send help to the besieged.

619
00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:41.310
Um,
epidem Ian's,

620
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:46.390
they also agree to send an army,
which,
uh,

621
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:47.580
the first day we'll send a fleet,

622
00:45:47.581 --> 00:45:49.740
then they'll send an army which will go there as well.

623
00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:54.490
And they are also are willing to,
uh,

624
00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:59.570
colony recolonize the city because of course the city is now divided between two

625
00:46:00.121 --> 00:46:03.540
sides.
So if they're going to,
if the people inside are going to win the war,

626
00:46:03.541 --> 00:46:05.670
ultimately they're going to need new citizens.

627
00:46:05.671 --> 00:46:08.100
They're not going to want to take back those people trying to kill him.

628
00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:12.900
So the Athenian,
the currency is organized a new colony to join them.

629
00:46:12.901 --> 00:46:13.411
In other words,

630
00:46:13.411 --> 00:46:18.000
they give them every kind of help than anybody can imagine.

631
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.080
Now,

632
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:24.080
if we look for a reason why the Corinthians should have been willing to make

633
00:46:24.541 --> 00:46:27.900
this enormous contribution to this faraway argument,

634
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:31.950
scholars have had a field day for centuries trying to figure out what the

635
00:46:31.951 --> 00:46:36.300
tangible benefits are with absolutely no look,

636
00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:40.800
there is no evidence of that is persuasive at all.

637
00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:45.890
That there are economic benefits to current that are significant if they somehow

638
00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:52.170
have control,
no matter what style control of Epidem this.

639
00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:55.920
And so I think we are driven back

640
00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:59.520
as we should have been driven in the first place.

641
00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:04.600
Does there acidities explanation who himself asks the question and answers it

642
00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:08.100
about the whole quarrel between cards and of course Syrah.

643
00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:13.460
And he refers simply to the hatred that the Corinthians felt towards the course

644
00:47:16.171 --> 00:47:20.080
of readings.
When you get to that passage to take a good look at it,
uh,

645
00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.730
because [inaudible] understands that we're all gonna raise our eyebrows a bit.

646
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.580
And so he tells us a tale.
Why is that?
So?
He says,

647
00:47:26.581 --> 00:47:31.581
because every year the Corinthians hold a religious festival in their city to

648
00:47:33.791 --> 00:47:38.440
which all of their allies sending delegates,
this is very normal.

649
00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:43.660
And all the other delegates treat them as you should treat a mother city with

650
00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:47.080
deference,
with respect,
with gratitude,
with kindness.

651
00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:51.940
What through the course of eons,
do they abuse them publicly?

652
00:47:51.941 --> 00:47:55.720
They,
they call them names,
they treat them like dirt.

653
00:47:55.960 --> 00:48:00.580
They insult them in front of all of the,
uh,
in front of the family,

654
00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:05.140
so to speak.
And therefore the Corinthians hate them.

655
00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:11.040
And out of this furious dislike that that is what their actions are about.

656
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.790
This has made scholars in the modern world very nervous.

657
00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:21.160
They understand that there are only two things that make people fight one

658
00:48:21.161 --> 00:48:23.410
another.
One of,
well,
yeah,

659
00:48:23.411 --> 00:48:25.690
that's pretty much what they used to say now that I think of it,

660
00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:31.450
and many of them still do in the face of what we see in the world today,
uh,

661
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:35.290
one is money that is economic gain.

662
00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:39.250
Thank we can thank marks for that.

663
00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.710
And for a whole century or more,

664
00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:45.430
people couldn't understand that people ever do anything for any reason except

665
00:48:45.431 --> 00:48:49.840
for monetary gain.
There isn't anything in this to explain it.

666
00:48:49.841 --> 00:48:51.760
It just won't do no scholars.

667
00:48:51.761 --> 00:48:54.760
They failed and attempting to show how that might be true.

668
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:59.980
The other has to do with power.
Uh,
you know,
relationships.

669
00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:03.520
Uh,
if you,
if you have this state on your side,

670
00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:05.680
it will give the balance of power to you and so on.

671
00:49:05.681 --> 00:49:08.340
But the truth of the matter is the epidemic,

672
00:49:08.341 --> 00:49:13.341
this is essentially irrelevant to the ordinary struggles of power between these

673
00:49:13.391 --> 00:49:18.340
two states at Corinth and,
uh,
and uh,
of course,
IRA,
of course,

674
00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:22.740
Ira won't be poorer.
It won't be weaker if the Corinthians have epidemic.

675
00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:28.420
Uh,
nor is there some kind of a tremendous strategic edge if you can launch your

676
00:49:28.421 --> 00:49:31.990
attack from epidem this rather than from someplace else.
No,
no.

677
00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:35.050
There's no reason to doubt two acidities about this.

678
00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:39.730
This is about honor and it's about dishonor.

679
00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:44.830
Now,
does that sound very remote?
Who Cares about honor and 20th century,

680
00:49:44.831 --> 00:49:48.310
21st Century?
What,
what kind of nonsense is this?

681
00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:53.050
I will tell you that you and everybody around you and everything you see in the

682
00:49:53.051 --> 00:49:57.130
world today is motivated more frequently,
especially in conflict,

683
00:49:57.310 --> 00:49:58.510
but other things too.

684
00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:03.570
The way you lead your life is influenced more by considerations of honor then of

685
00:50:05.771 --> 00:50:08.260
anything else.
If some,

686
00:50:08.261 --> 00:50:11.290
and let me put it in the way that is most helpful in this context.

687
00:50:11.291 --> 00:50:13.090
It's really the negative that's important.

688
00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:16.570
More important than honor is dishonor.

689
00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:21.700
People hate to be dishonored.
They hate.

690
00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:26.330
There was a wonderful slang word that now tells the story.

691
00:50:26.331 --> 00:50:29.840
It wasn't available when I was a kid.
The thing was available,

692
00:50:29.841 --> 00:50:34.010
but the word wasn't available.
If I say to you,
he dismayed.

693
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:36.223
Do you know what I mean?

694
00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:41.360
Do you think there's a danger to your teeth if you just the wrong guy?

695
00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:47.620
Do you doubt that that sort of thing motivates individual people constantly?

696
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:52.860
And I can show you an already shown the world that uh,

697
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.480
it motivates nations constantly today,

698
00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:00.860
not only 20 years ago or 500 years ago,
2000 years ago.

699
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:03.740
That's what the acidities is showing us here.

700
00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:06.290
This is a very important permanent truth.

701
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:11.240
This is why their cities is so superior to modern political scientists studying

702
00:51:11.241 --> 00:51:12.410
international relations.

703
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:16.700
They don't understand these things and two cities did.

704
00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:20.540
So that I think is what is happening.

705
00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:23.600
And when it becomes clear to core Syrah,

706
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:26.240
that currents is involved,

707
00:51:26.241 --> 00:51:31.241
that they are looking for a fight and that they have dishonored course Syrah by

708
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:34.310
taking over one of their colonies.

709
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:38.480
The cost marines are on the one hand angered,
but on the other hand,

710
00:51:38.481 --> 00:51:40.670
they're frightened because current is a great,

711
00:51:40.671 --> 00:51:45.671
powerful state and more important than that current is one of the most

712
00:51:45.681 --> 00:51:48.080
significant allies of Sparta.

713
00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:50.840
If the Corinthians are giving us grief,

714
00:51:50.841 --> 00:51:55.841
the Costa Ricans could think this is a prelude to having the Peloponnesian

715
00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.020
League come after us.
And that is not something you want to happen.

716
00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:05.290
So the course of [inaudible] ask for a conference with the Corinthians and uh,

717
00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:12.980
they come and say,
let's let us find a way to make peace over this issue.

718
00:52:12.981 --> 00:52:17.510
Let's see how we can negotiate.
A piece of Corinthians are adamant.
They say,

719
00:52:17.511 --> 00:52:19.310
you want peace.
This is what you've got to do.

720
00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:25.210
You have got to withdraw your forces from the city.

721
00:52:26.931 --> 00:52:31.460
Here you are B,
uh,
uh,
besieging the city.

722
00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:33.690
And uh,
let me see if they're riding the Chris,

723
00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:37.640
of course the rains have come with their fleet.
They have defeated the uh,

724
00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:40.730
you know,
I've been,
I always get this so backwards.

725
00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:44.450
Let me see if I've got this right.
What are the core server Ian's doing?

726
00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:49.190
Curtis?
Are they on the side of the guys inside or outside?
Do you remember?

727
00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:56.860
You're on the inside.
Yeah,
that's right.

728
00:52:57.070 --> 00:53:02.070
But they have now of their armies are in the field and they're navy is at see

729
00:53:02.381 --> 00:53:07.381
against the opposition to the folks are inside the city and um,

730
00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:10.780
so the currency and say you are,

731
00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:14.500
you're finding these people and you're asking us to talk peace while you're

732
00:53:14.501 --> 00:53:19.120
fighting these people.
You're withdrawing your people and then we'll talk peace.

733
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:23.460
Well of course that would give the advantage to the other side and the coverage

734
00:53:23.461 --> 00:53:26.340
of course.
Reagan said no way and tell you what,

735
00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:31.770
we'll withdraw our people if you withdraw your people.
Corinthians said,

736
00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:32.693
no way.

737
00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:37.080
I think what comes out of this back and forth is important.

738
00:53:37.081 --> 00:53:42.081
It's it is that the course of [inaudible] are not looking to expand this fight.

739
00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:47.460
They want to end it not because they're peaceful and lovable fellows,

740
00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:51.270
but because they're afraid of where this thing will go.

741
00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:56.300
We are now dealing with another term that came into fruition in the 20th

742
00:53:56.341 --> 00:54:00.000
century.
Escalation is what these guys were afraid of.

743
00:54:00.001 --> 00:54:03.000
We've got this little fight going on here,
but next thing you know,

744
00:54:03.001 --> 00:54:05.520
we may find the Peloponnesian League involved,

745
00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:11.490
but the Corinthians clearly aren't worried about that and that's going to be a

746
00:54:11.491 --> 00:54:14.100
point we have to cope with.
They,
um,

747
00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:17.723
<v 1>mmm.</v>

748
00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:24.180
<v 0>Right.
The current,
the course serines say,
look,</v>

749
00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:27.750
if you don't work this out with us now,

750
00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:32.040
we may have to seek allies,

751
00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:36.270
other allies besides those.
We already have wealth.

752
00:54:36.271 --> 00:54:38.670
Who cities has told us they don't have any other allies,

753
00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:42.840
but who are these allies that they're going to seek?

754
00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:47.510
That's a real question.
Somebody telling me.

755
00:54:48.610 --> 00:54:49.140
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

756
00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:51.210
<v 0>Athens,
of course.
I wanted you to tell me,</v>

757
00:54:51.211 --> 00:54:54.450
because I want to emphasize how obvious it is.

758
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:58.110
Nobody could have missed the signal.
This is a threat.

759
00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:02.700
We know you Corinthians are playing as tough as you are because you're counting

760
00:55:02.701 --> 00:55:05.790
on the Spartans to assist you.
Well,
if you do,

761
00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:10.740
we will ask the Athenians to help us and then what?

762
00:55:11.550 --> 00:55:16.320
And so the,
the situation goes forward.
The Corinthians are not bluffed.

763
00:55:16.321 --> 00:55:20.790
If it was really a bluff and uh,
uh,
on they go,

764
00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:22.403
<v 1>mmm.</v>

765
00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:26.670
<v 0>It by,
I should point out that at this,
um,</v>

766
00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:32.140
meeting the course serines said they were willing to submit this quarrel to

767
00:55:33.261 --> 00:55:34.910
arbitration.
I remind you again,

768
00:55:34.911 --> 00:55:39.590
not mediation to turn it over to a third party and have them settle the question

769
00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:44.510
to Corinthians.
Turn that down.
I think that alone indicates,

770
00:55:44.770 --> 00:55:49.310
uh,
who wanted war and who wanted peace at this point.
Um,

771
00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:51.820
the other thing is that a,

772
00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:54.473
<v 1>mmm,</v>

773
00:55:55.980 --> 00:56:00.980
<v 0>it should be remembered that the 30 years peace provided that neutrals,</v>

774
00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:07.760
we're free to join eva side that had signed the 30 years piece so that when they

775
00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:14.820
were implying and threatening and alliance with Athens,

776
00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:20.120
they understood that the Athenians were free to accept them into the alliance

777
00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:25.810
without breaking the 30 years.
That would be a considerable issue.

778
00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:30.700
As the problem grow is more difficult.
Well,

779
00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:35.020
there is no peace.
And so the two sides organize their navies.

780
00:56:35.021 --> 00:56:39.370
The Corinthians did not have a large standing Navien peacetime and they set to

781
00:56:39.371 --> 00:56:42.880
work to put one together.
In four 35,

782
00:56:42.881 --> 00:56:45.370
there is the battle of Luke Kidney,

783
00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:50.030
which takes place between the Corinthians and the uh,

784
00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:54.760
um,
of course the Koreans and the course of marines when

785
00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:58.180
current is not deterred.

786
00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:03.540
Now they really go to work and they build for them a vast fleet consisting of 90

787
00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:09.580
ships,
unprecedented outside of Athens.

788
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:13.510
And they do turn not enough in an official way,

789
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:18.750
but unofficially to their Peloponnesian allies asking them to contribute help

790
00:57:18.941 --> 00:57:19.660
too.

791
00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:24.250
And they're Peloponnesian allies and another 60 ships.

792
00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:29.880
And so the Corinthians have available a total of 150 ships.

793
00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:32.290
The core,

794
00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:37.290
the core Syrian sleep consisted of 120 ships.

795
00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:43.680
They did have a fleet that they kept at all times and that had given them the

796
00:57:44.141 --> 00:57:47.200
confidence in advance to do what they had done.

797
00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:53.120
But here was Carmen's suddenly outnumbering them in this way of Coursera was now

798
00:57:54.791 --> 00:57:55.810
thoroughly frightened.

799
00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:59.140
They knew that Corinthians would be coming after them again with a fleet that

800
00:57:59.141 --> 00:58:00.340
was bigger than theirs.

801
00:58:00.850 --> 00:58:05.850
So they went to Athens in September of four 33 and now I ask you again to

802
00:58:07.421 --> 00:58:12.421
imagine yourself sitting there on the picnics in Athens in September for 33

803
00:58:14.770 --> 00:58:19.690
whereas the,
of course the Regan ambassadors have come to your town.

804
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:24.730
They're going to ask you to join in an alliance with them for the purpose of

805
00:58:24.731 --> 00:58:27.160
fighting the Corinthians and their friends.

806
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:31.870
The Corinthians who have heard about this scent ambassadors of their own to

807
00:58:31.871 --> 00:58:32.704
Athens.

808
00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:37.600
They are present on that same hill and they will make their case as to why the

809
00:58:37.601 --> 00:58:42.460
Athenians should say no to that request to acidities reports.

810
00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:46.990
His version of both speeches is every reason to think.

811
00:58:46.991 --> 00:58:51.940
He was sitting there in the Athenian Assembly on the days in which these

812
00:58:51.941 --> 00:58:53.650
discussions took place.

813
00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:59.890
The essence of the course,
serene argument is that,
well,

814
00:58:59.950 --> 00:59:02.020
here are the,
here are the points they made.

815
00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:05.110
Corrine's is wrong.

816
00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:10.920
It is not a breach of the 30 years' peace for Athens to accept the course of

817
00:59:11.681 --> 00:59:15.400
marines into their alliance because neutrals are permitted.

818
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:19.510
Then they go through a lot of stuff to show that the Corinthians are bad guys

819
00:59:19.511 --> 00:59:24.511
making arguments on the grounds of a morality and virtue and decency and obeying

820
00:59:25.311 --> 00:59:26.630
the law and all kinds of stuff.

821
00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:31.730
But it's clear that that's not what's on their minds.
They are talking about,

822
00:59:31.790 --> 00:59:34.150
um,
uh,

823
00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:38.180
basically they tried to convince the Athenians on the grounds of the

824
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:43.630
significance of their decision for the balance of power and essentially the

825
00:59:44.511 --> 00:59:48.350
balance of naval power in the Greek world.

826
00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:52.880
They,
in passing,

827
00:59:52.881 --> 00:59:57.881
they make the point that of course Syrah is very well situated for a naval or I

828
00:59:59.971 --> 01:00:04.971
sh I mean for a sea voyage to Sicily in Italy where the Athenians and others are

829
01:00:06.591 --> 01:00:10.310
always wanting to go,
so you want to be on our side.

830
01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:15.050
That's not really a very potent argument because no town,

831
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:20.080
no polis shuts its ports to any other polis except in war time.

832
01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:26.240
So it's only when they mentioned that they only have to be talking about why

833
01:00:26.241 --> 01:00:30.830
it's valuable to be allied with Coursera because,

834
01:00:30.831 --> 01:00:33.560
and this is their most powerful underlying argument.

835
01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:37.550
There's going to be a war.
Don't kid yourself.

836
01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:40.940
Athenians is what they are saying.
And when that war comes,

837
01:00:40.941 --> 01:00:43.850
you're going to want to be us.
You're going to want to have us on your side.

838
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:48.770
In part because of our convenience,
our strategic location.
On the other hand,

839
01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:52.850
more powerful is the fact we have 120 ships.

840
01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:57.650
If those 120 if we lose,

841
01:00:57.651 --> 01:00:59.210
if you let the Corinthians beat us,

842
01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:04.510
our ships will fall into their hands and then they will have a much mightier

843
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:07.520
fleet than even the one they have put together.

844
01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:12.580
And now your unquestioned dominance of the sea will be challenged.

845
01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:16.490
That's what's at issue.

846
01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:21.280
And don't imagine that this is just uh,

847
01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:25.010
anybody's imagination.
This is going to happen.

848
01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.140
The war is coming.

849
01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:32.890
An enormous amount of what's happening here has to do with your perception of

850
01:01:33.051 --> 01:01:38.051
whether war is now inevitable and whether or whether by by restraint you can

851
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:46.250
preserve the peace.
That's the problem that the Athenians face.

852
01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:51.520
It's a terribly interesting one because it happens so very often on the brinks

853
01:01:52.221 --> 01:01:57.221
of wars when that's the issue that determines what people will do or uh,

854
01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:02.800
and how they react if they don't think that taking a certain action or I'm sorry

855
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:07.160
cause they don't think the war is coming anyway.

856
01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:12.080
They may very well decide to refrain from an action that might provoke a war.

857
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:14.990
If on the other hand,
they think war is coming,
they,

858
01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:20.410
they feel that it's too dangerous not to make our capacity to win the war more

859
01:02:21.991 --> 01:02:26.220
likely.
And so they may well take a step which makes the war more likely,

860
01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:29.460
uh,
and they're both gambles.

861
01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:33.450
Nobody knows for sure one way or another you have to make an estimate.

862
01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:35.190
And that's always the way it is.

863
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.330
Unless you are simply an aggressive state and all you want to do is conquering.

864
01:02:39.331 --> 01:02:40.890
You don't care anything about anything else.

865
01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:46.250
You're always trying to figure out will it be safer to fight or not to fight?

866
01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:51.180
Will it be safer to try to make a concession or will that make it more
dangerous?

867
01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:54.420
Those are always the issues,
always the problems.

868
01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:00.680
One of the great in facilities that I discover all through my life as people

869
01:03:00.901 --> 01:03:05.901
contemplate going to war at different times in our time is the quiet assumption,

870
01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:11.820
unquestioned,
unexamined,
that restraint,

871
01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:15.000
the failure to take action is safe.

872
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:20.250
Taking action is dangerous.
Whereas our experience,

873
01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:24.630
even in my lifetime has demonstrated that's often wrong.

874
01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.520
Nothing could be clearer to me.

875
01:03:26.521 --> 01:03:31.200
And I think to most people who have studied the subject that not acting against

876
01:03:31.201 --> 01:03:36.201
Hitler as he took one step after another to rip up the piece of hearing,

877
01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:39.900
what's the most dangerous thing they could possibly do,

878
01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:45.080
far more dangerous than confronting him early as early as 1936 when he invaded

879
01:03:46.141 --> 01:03:50.160
the Rhineland.
And that's not the only case of it does that.

880
01:03:50.161 --> 01:03:51.300
There's no simple rule.

881
01:03:51.301 --> 01:03:55.290
Sometimes it's wise or not to act and sometimes it's wiser to act,

882
01:03:55.291 --> 01:04:00.291
but it's never clear which one is more likely to produce peace and safety.

883
01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:04.890
And that's what the Athenians had to wrestle with.
Uh,
on that day,

884
01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:09.920
the Corinthians responded to the argument of the course of Reince denying their

885
01:04:11.221 --> 01:04:14.880
picture of things.
They said,
in fact,

886
01:04:14.881 --> 01:04:16.980
if you sign up with the,
uh,

887
01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:21.120
of course regions now you will be in violation of the 30 years' peace.

888
01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:22.681
What they were saying,

889
01:04:22.681 --> 01:04:27.681
I guess in the abstract was don't worry about the letter of the law of the

890
01:04:27.781 --> 01:04:30.690
treaty because that clearly permits an alliance,

891
01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.330
the spirit that counts.
They said,

892
01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:38.390
surely nobody imagined that this decision would be made at a time when one of

893
01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:44.820
the people who are the neutral is asking you to join in was already at or with

894
01:04:44.821 --> 01:04:49.680
one of us.
Surely nobody had that in mind.
There's certainly right,
nobody did.

895
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:53.100
The question is on the legal points.

896
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:58.670
My guesses the Athenians had the better the argument it says in black letter law

897
01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.233
it says,

898
01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:05.240
you may take a neutral if neutral asks you for in the lions there's nothing that

899
01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:09.120
says,
except that when that neutral is attacking us didn't say that.

900
01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:09.871
On the other hand,

901
01:05:09.871 --> 01:05:12.450
who in his right mind could imagine it would be okay to do that.

902
01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:16.140
So that was one issue that the Corinthians spoke to.

903
01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:19.410
Um,
but they,

904
01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:22.510
they made another point that was legalistic as well.
And this one,

905
01:05:22.511 --> 01:05:24.430
I think the crisis,
the Corinthians is much worse.

906
01:05:24.431 --> 01:05:29.431
They said the principle established in the 30 years piece was that each side

907
01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:36.960
could punish its own allies without the interference of the other side.

908
01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:42.280
Now,
as a matter of fact,
it didn't say that.

909
01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:48.400
But the other thing that's wrong with that statement is it's one thing for

910
01:05:48.401 --> 01:05:53.350
Athens to punish Samos,
which is an ally and ask,

911
01:05:53.351 --> 01:05:56.410
and the Corinthian st fine,
that's your business.
We want intervene.

912
01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:01.840
But Car Syrah is not the ally of current.
In fact,

913
01:06:01.841 --> 01:06:03.880
they are bitter enemies of yesteryear.

914
01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:09.360
There's no part of that treaty that protects the Corinthian right to a tech

915
01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:10.390
salary.

916
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:15.390
So it's a great argument if you don't look at the validity of the facts that are

917
01:06:15.671 --> 01:06:19.090
alleged.
Carmen's got a very bad case here,

918
01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:24.250
but they're really important argument.
Is this a currency?

919
01:06:24.251 --> 01:06:29.240
The cursory in say the war is inevitable?
Well isn't.

920
01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:33.790
If the fact is they tell them if he means if you were smart,

921
01:06:33.791 --> 01:06:37.660
the thing you would do would be to join us and together we'll smash the course

922
01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:42.100
serines and then there's no more problem.
Uh,
but if you don't do that,

923
01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:47.130
at the very least refrain from joining them because then we will be friends and

924
01:06:48.191 --> 01:06:52.300
then we will have peace in the future.
But make no mistake about it.

925
01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:55.810
If you do accept,
of course the range into your alliance now,

926
01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:00.580
then there will be war.
War is not inevitable,

927
01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:04.450
but your action can make it inevitable.

928
01:07:05.530 --> 01:07:10.200
So that's what the Athenians confront when they have to make their decision.

929
01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:15.610
Again,
I,
the drama of this is so striking.
I want to be sure you conceive of it.

930
01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.860
They are sitting there.
All,

931
01:07:17.861 --> 01:07:21.610
everything I've told you so far has been said on the same day.

932
01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:25.420
And now the Athenian start talking about what should we do?

933
01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:30.430
It's the same day.
The people who are sitting on the panics,

934
01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:33.310
if the day is clear as they used to be in Athens,

935
01:07:33.311 --> 01:07:38.311
just about every day can look out across an Attica to the north.

936
01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:43.680
And they can see that area into which the Sparkman and Peloponnesian army,

937
01:07:44.891 --> 01:07:49.891
we'll march and start destroying their farms three days from now.

938
01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:55.430
But possibly if a war starts and who is going to be doing that,

939
01:07:56.381 --> 01:07:59.440
fighting out there,
we will.

940
01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:04.780
Those of us who were sitting here voting whether to go to war or not,

941
01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:10.630
uh,
I'm always struck by the immediate,
the immediacy and the,

942
01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:14.920
the significance of what these guys were doing.

943
01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.840
Somebody tell me this is not a democracy please.

944
01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:23.800
So it is of course the same kind of thing they faced back in [inaudible] 61 when

945
01:08:26.781 --> 01:08:30.020
they had to decide whether to take a mega into the alliance.
Again,

946
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:34.100
there are significant differences,
but the issue is very much the same.

947
01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:40.160
They can't be sure.
Maybe if they back off and refuse the alliance,

948
01:08:40.190 --> 01:08:44.840
maybe that will be the end of the problem and they'll live happily ever after.

949
01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:45.913
On the other hand,

950
01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:49.580
if they're wrong about that and the Corinthians to take over this fleet,

951
01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:54.610
suddenly they will find themselves vulnerable in a way they have not been since

952
01:08:55.791 --> 01:08:59.240
they put their empire together.

953
01:08:59.390 --> 01:09:01.400
I always find it illuminating to me anyway.

954
01:09:01.401 --> 01:09:06.401
And I hope to you as well to make an analogy to Great Britain at the end of the

955
01:09:07.671 --> 01:09:10.310
19th and the beginning of the 20th century,

956
01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:12.890
Great Britain at the beginning of the 19th,

957
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:15.920
a sort of in the middle and after in the 19th century came,

958
01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:19.010
we had the greatest navy in the world without question.

959
01:09:19.250 --> 01:09:24.230
It was the greatest power in the world who had this enormous empire that ruled

960
01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:29.840
and it,
uh,
it looked,
um,
its,

961
01:09:29.841 --> 01:09:34.841
its vulnerabilities were mainly against France and Russia who were to imperial

962
01:09:35.991 --> 01:09:40.700
rivals in the areas that the British cared about most.

963
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:42.620
And they typically,
they,
at a certain point,

964
01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:47.920
they decided to make their fleet to be the size of the next two fleets put

965
01:09:49.401 --> 01:09:54.320
together in order to feel secure in case a war broke out.

966
01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:55.670
And that's what they did.

967
01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:00.740
Everything was fine until Kaiser William becomes the emperor of Germany.

968
01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:01.551
And the,

969
01:10:01.551 --> 01:10:06.551
towards the end of the 20th of the 19th century decides that Germany must be a

970
01:10:06.921 --> 01:10:10.010
great naval power,
must be a world empire.

971
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:14.450
It must challenge Britain for that,
uh,
Opportunity.

972
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:19.510
And they begin to build a fleet of battleships whose only purpose can be to

973
01:10:20.691 --> 01:10:25.691
destroy the British fleet and to allow the Germans to invade Britain and

974
01:10:25.881 --> 01:10:30.460
thereby,
or best of all to intimidate the British,
uh,

975
01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:33.820
into stepping aside and allowing the Germans to do what they want to do.

976
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:38.390
As soon as the,
this becomes clear to the British,

977
01:10:38.391 --> 01:10:41.180
as soon as the Germans start building that sleep,

978
01:10:41.410 --> 01:10:46.410
it is not yet strong enough to defeat the British fleet and the British enter

979
01:10:46.911 --> 01:10:51.911
into a naval race to see to it that they don't get to be big enough to take out

980
01:10:52.431 --> 01:10:55.670
the British fleet.
But,
uh,
it's very costly.

981
01:10:55.671 --> 01:10:59.090
The British don't like it and they try to find every way they can and what they

982
01:10:59.091 --> 01:11:02.570
do is completely flipped their diplomacy,

983
01:11:02.571 --> 01:11:07.400
which has dominated their behavior for over a hundred years and they make an

984
01:11:07.401 --> 01:11:12.401
alliance with France and Russia to see to it that the Germans are checked and

985
01:11:14.581 --> 01:11:17.160
prevented from doing what they're planning to do.

986
01:11:18.450 --> 01:11:20.880
I think that does help to understand what the,

987
01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:25.380
what the Athenians are doing when you are as in the case of Britain and Ireland

988
01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:27.630
state as in the case of Athens,

989
01:11:27.631 --> 01:11:31.950
you might as well be an island state because you are dependent on imports for

990
01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:36.720
your food supply and the command of the seas essential for acquiring that.

991
01:11:37.290 --> 01:11:38.550
In such a case,

992
01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:44.150
it is not an a light thing to permit a change in the naval balance of power

993
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:50.670
which may make you seriously vulnerable in case of war.

994
01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:55.140
The point I want to make is that the British didn't wait until the Germans had

995
01:11:55.170 --> 01:11:56.370
equal therefores.

996
01:11:56.730 --> 01:12:01.730
They changed their policy and ultimately moved into war to prevent it and that's

997
01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:05.460
where the Athenians I think found themselves.

998
01:12:05.461 --> 01:12:08.970
It was something they were not willing to do,

999
01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:14.240
but it was a very hard call and we are told that they argued so long that it got

1000
01:12:14.461 --> 01:12:18.000
dark before the decision could be made.

1001
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:23.070
A through acidity says it was thought that they were inclining against the

1002
01:12:23.761 --> 01:12:26.520
alliance.
When it got dark,

1003
01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:29.310
they met again the next day.

1004
01:12:29.370 --> 01:12:34.370
And this time they voted for something a bit different from what they had been

1005
01:12:34.861 --> 01:12:38.370
talking about the day before.
What the,
uh,
court,

1006
01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:43.020
of course [inaudible] had been requesting was a typical alliance.

1007
01:12:43.021 --> 01:12:45.060
The only kind we know of between Greeks,

1008
01:12:45.630 --> 01:12:49.920
a summa HIA and offensive and defensive alliance.

1009
01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:54.980
It would have required the Athenians to,
uh,

1010
01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.720
go out and fight the Corinthians,

1011
01:12:58.710 --> 01:13:01.470
even if the Corinthians didn't attack.
Of course,
Iran,

1012
01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:04.680
it would have put them fully at war against the Corinthians.

1013
01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:10.260
That's not what the Athenians voted on the second day.

1014
01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:15.350
They voted on the proposition that they establish something called an Epi Mahia,

1015
01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:19.140
which means a defensive alliance only.

1016
01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:22.860
They would only fight against an enemy.

1017
01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:25.280
With that enemy had attacked of course,

1018
01:13:25.281 --> 01:13:30.090
Syrah and was in the process of landing on their territory.

1019
01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:35.550
And so that's finally what the Athenians did.

1020
01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:38.160
That was the vote.
They joke,
once again,

1021
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:42.450
we have something unheard of before a,
a device,

1022
01:13:42.510 --> 01:13:47.510
which is the way largely a diplomatic device meant to have consequences on

1023
01:13:49.081 --> 01:13:52.650
thinking rather than immediate military results.

1024
01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:57.990
So I say it's got to be cliche but I feel better this time because Plutarch's

1025
01:13:57.991 --> 01:14:00.710
says it was Paris,
please.
Even though you said it,

1026
01:14:00.711 --> 01:14:02.940
he's doesn't say who made that proposal.

1027
01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:06.990
It was a clearly what Pericles has wanted to because he holds to it very,

1028
01:14:06.991 --> 01:14:09.540
very firmly in both directions,

1029
01:14:09.541 --> 01:14:14.541
both in terms of the limits that this puts on Athenian action but on the

1030
01:14:14.741 --> 01:14:17.890
determination to take that action no matter what.

1031
01:14:18.490 --> 01:14:22.960
What I suggest to you is that we are going to be dealing from here on him.

1032
01:14:23.650 --> 01:14:27.910
We've been dealing with in a general way anyway,
but now it's very clear.

1033
01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.190
This is Perry please policy.

1034
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:35.530
I assert it is a policy intended to keep the peace

1035
01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:41.800
and here again we run into a problem in our own time in which sort of the normal

1036
01:14:41.801 --> 01:14:46.210
reaction of people is if you want to keep the peace,

1037
01:14:46.211 --> 01:14:48.220
what you want to do is to be a nice guy.

1038
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:51.010
What you want to do is to make concessions.

1039
01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:55.570
You want not to frighten the potential enemy you want to show that you have no

1040
01:14:55.571 --> 01:15:00.220
ill will towards him and then reason will prevail and you can all have a nice

1041
01:15:00.221 --> 01:15:03.670
chat and go off for tea.
Of course,

1042
01:15:03.850 --> 01:15:05.470
that's not the way it is at all.

1043
01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:10.740
One way always that has been used by nations in the hope of keeping peace is the

1044
01:15:12.101 --> 01:15:17.101
opposite device of deterrents where there isn't any hope of coming to a happy

1045
01:15:18.311 --> 01:15:22.060
agreement because if there had been you wouldn't be in the spot you're in now,

1046
01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:27.420
all you can do is try to indicate to your opponent that he will not achieve the

1047
01:15:27.551 --> 01:15:32.080
goals he seeks if he launches a war against you,

1048
01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:35.950
and so that requires that you be very strong,

1049
01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:40.390
militarily strong and strong in the way in which you negotiate.

1050
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:44.290
On the other hand,
if that is your goal,
the deterrence,

1051
01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:49.510
then you also want to be very careful not to behave in such a way that is too

1052
01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:50.344
frightening,

1053
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:55.830
that indicates to your opponent that you are likely to defeat him if he allows

1054
01:15:58.241 --> 01:16:02.860
you to be as strong as you would like to be.
You want to,

1055
01:16:02.861 --> 01:16:04.310
uh,
um,

1056
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:09.190
be avoid taking an action that will make him lose his rationality,

1057
01:16:09.191 --> 01:16:13.780
that will make him so angry that he will forget about these questions of,

1058
01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:17.980
uh,
success and failure.
He'll just say,
I'm going to get that son of a gun.

1059
01:16:18.610 --> 01:16:23.610
And then I argue is the policy that [inaudible] pursuit and attempt at

1060
01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:29.520
deterrence and moderation at the same time to frighten the opponent by his

1061
01:16:31.841 --> 01:16:36.460
determination out of thinking that can do what they want without a danger of

1062
01:16:36.461 --> 01:16:41.140
war,
but also to avoid inflaming is a anger

1063
01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:46.660
in the short run.

1064
01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:52.590
What happens is that the Athenians send to assist their pell of there.

1065
01:16:53.591 --> 01:16:58.591
Of course we in our lies a fleet of only 10 triremes there.

1066
01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:05.350
This is in explicable in my view,
except in terms of this,

1067
01:17:05.470 --> 01:17:07.690
the strategy that I have suggested,

1068
01:17:08.530 --> 01:17:13.430
what he's is sending,
really not a forest,
but a diplomatic message.

1069
01:17:13.431 --> 01:17:14.540
He is telling the Corinthians,

1070
01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:19.220
you have been counting on the fact that we would stay out of this.
Well,

1071
01:17:19.221 --> 01:17:20.360
you were wrong.

1072
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:25.390
We will not allow you to defeat the course Suria navy because we find that

1073
01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:28.250
unacceptable and dangerous.

1074
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:32.150
So we're sending this force to help the core Syrians,

1075
01:17:32.151 --> 01:17:33.950
not because we want to fight you,

1076
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:37.340
but because we want you to see that was serious about this.

1077
01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:41.300
Don't start the fight.
Well,

1078
01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:46.360
the Corinthian sale air fleet against course Syrah and their follows a battle at

1079
01:17:47.691 --> 01:17:52.691
sea called the battle of Sib Bota and two cities describes the battle itself.

1080
01:17:56.570 --> 01:18:00.530
Very tough battle.
The Athenians are,
I'm sorry,

1081
01:18:00.531 --> 01:18:03.230
I haven't told you one thing you need to know.
Um,

1082
01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:05.960
the Athenians will line up on one end of the Corinthia,

1083
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:08.210
the course in line with their 10 ships.

1084
01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:14.000
The commanders of that fleet are determined as well.

1085
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:16.760
Those 10 ships are commanded by three generals.

1086
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.090
That's a lot of generals with potential.

1087
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:25.030
But one of them who is the chief figure there is lasted diammonium [inaudible]

1088
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:30.980
the son of Cayman.
Well,
of course,

1089
01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:36.640
he is clearly seen by everybody else as not one of Parak pleases boys,

1090
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:42.560
not a stooge of Paris.
[inaudible] he's an independent.
And what does,

1091
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:45.170
what's his name mean?
Mr Spartan.

1092
01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:51.280
Now if the Athenians get drawn into that battle and the command that we should

1093
01:18:51.531 --> 01:18:54.640
do so is done by less than diammonium,

1094
01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:59.180
then of course that will not have the effect of dividing the Athenians,

1095
01:18:59.330 --> 01:19:01.130
but it will make it much harder to divide.

1096
01:19:01.131 --> 01:19:04.490
The Athenians will be much easier to say all Athenians,

1097
01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:09.190
even those who have the kindest attitude toward Sparta thought that this was a

1098
01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.520
necessary step,

1099
01:19:10.730 --> 01:19:14.930
which I think was aimed not at Corinthians so much.

1100
01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:17.420
It was aimed of course at Athenian politics,

1101
01:19:17.570 --> 01:19:19.610
but I think it was aimed at the Spartans too,

1102
01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:23.470
because then if the Spartans were then asked by the Corinthian,

1103
01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:26.180
so look what happened,
come in and help us against the Athenians.

1104
01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:30.380
They would have to face the fact that even lasted diammonium thought this was

1105
01:19:30.381 --> 01:19:33.650
necessary.
It's the same game.

1106
01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:38.680
All of these are cagey moves by [inaudible] to pursue his extremely complicated,

1107
01:19:40.010 --> 01:19:44.990
tricky kind of a strategy.
And I see that I have run over my time,

1108
01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:47.150
so I'll pick up the tail next time.
