1
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.260
In the year 400 in one.

2
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.700
The Prince of Persia Cyrus

3
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.600
who is a younger son and had been

4
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.920
the the recent.

5
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.270
<v 1>Recently succeeded king of Persia artic circus sees his older brother was in</v>

6
00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:28.954
power.

7
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.110
Cyrus had always been ambitious for achieving the

8
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.970
job of Shah in Persia and his mother had worked in his behalf but it hadn't paid

9
00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:43.504
off.

10
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.720
He was not prepared to accept the verdict and so he set out in the year 400 and

11
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.430
one to launch a scheme that would bring him to the throne of Persia and his

12
00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:57.250
scheme was to hire.

13
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.900
A good sized army of Greek mercenaries and to trick them into becoming the army

14
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.300
that would defeat the army of his brother artic circuses and make him king.

15
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.940
<v 2>As it turned out one of the men who joined up on that expedition was in Athenian</v>

16
00:01:23.621 --> 00:01:28.621
cavalryman by the name of Xenophon and he left an account of that experience in

17
00:01:31.571 --> 00:01:33.790
a work that in court is called in Greek.

18
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.120
<v 1>The analysis which means that the march back but it's the story of how this body</v>

19
00:01:41.381 --> 00:01:46.381
of a turned out to be roughly 10000 Greek hop like mercenaries marched into the

20
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.390
heart of the Persian Empire defeated the Army of the great king.

21
00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.970
But in the process Prince Cyrus himself was killed.

22
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.260
And since the whole point of the expedition was to make him king there wasn't

23
00:02:05.261 --> 00:02:07.170
any point any longer and the great question.

24
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.050
I've told you about this earlier in the semester.

25
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
What should these 10000 Greeks do they end up after their generals are put to

26
00:02:15.521 --> 00:02:20.521
death by treachery to elect new generals and to fight their way out of the

27
00:02:21.101 --> 00:02:26.101
empire back to the Black Sea which was the easiest way for them to get home and

28
00:02:26.441 --> 00:02:29.900
then to do whatever it was they would do.

29
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.600
It was a very important event because and I think Xenophon's account of it was

30
00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:43.460
very very important because it planted in the minds of many Greeks a new notion

31
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.480
that the vast powerful wealthy empire of the Persians was remarkably vulnerable

32
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.090
and that it was an epoch.

33
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.050
It was possible and many thought highly desirable for the Greeks to turn the

34
00:02:57.051 --> 00:03:02.051
tables on the Persians to invade Persia and to take from it to to subdue it and

35
00:03:02.961 --> 00:03:07.160
to take from it the vast wealth that the Persians had.

36
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.820
And we shall see down through the years of the fourth century.

37
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.360
Different speakers will come out and speak or write urging that the Greeks do

38
00:03:18.111 --> 00:03:18.944
exactly this.

39
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.580
I Socrates the Athenian teacher of rhetoric was the foremost figure who kept

40
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.880
seeking some body who would undertake this chore.

41
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
One of the reasons that he gave for it more than once was that Greece was

42
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.630
suffering and of course had been for some time from poverty produced by war and

43
00:03:43.161 --> 00:03:48.050
most particularly by civil wars between Democrats and oligarchs that became more

44
00:03:48.051 --> 00:03:52.760
and more common in the fourth century and his solution was if you need money

45
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.850
steal it and so take it from the Persians and that would put an end to the

46
00:03:58.101 --> 00:03:58.934
troubles.

47
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.410
Well of course none of the Greek city states was capable of establishing

48
00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:07.700
leadership in Greece during the period we're studying now so that it could carry

49
00:04:07.701 --> 00:04:08.210
out.

50
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.210
Socrates wishes so he turned to a man that the rest of the Greeks regarded as or

51
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.360
many of the Greeks regarded as a barbarian the king of Macedon Philip and urged

52
00:04:19.671 --> 00:04:21.740
him to take on that course.

53
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.540
And apparently whether it was a Socrates or simply the idea itself.

54
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.150
Philip himself did intend to do exactly that to conquer the Persian Empire but

55
00:04:35.451 --> 00:04:37.310
he was killed before he could do it.

56
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.760
And the job was left to his quite young son Alexander who in fact accomplished

57
00:04:44.231 --> 00:04:47.510
that.
But we're looking down the road.
Let's go back to for one.

58
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.500
And there we see this expedition of ten thousand Greeks accomplishing what I

59
00:04:54.261 --> 00:04:58.340
mentioned to you that there could be ten thousand Greek hob lights available for

60
00:04:58.341 --> 00:04:59.174
such a purpose.

61
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.820
I think as a consequence of the Peloponnesian War it shows us how much that war

62
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.300
had helped to uproot people and to impoverish many of them so that the idea of

63
00:05:12.531 --> 00:05:17.531
becoming a mercenary soldier for a Persian prince was attractive enough to take

64
00:05:17.811 --> 00:05:22.430
them away from home something that would have been less likely in the prosperous

65
00:05:22.431 --> 00:05:25.190
years before the Peloponnesian War.

66
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.833
<v 3>Well of course</v>

67
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.300
that aside that's a kind of it is a kind of a sideshow it doesn't very much

68
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.330
affect what is happening to the Greek cities on the coast of Asia Minor who

69
00:05:38.881 --> 00:05:42.870
remain the issue as to what will happen.
Remember these were

70
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.640
under Athenian control during the Peloponnesian War and when the war was over

71
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.980
they were taken over in many cases by Lt.

72
00:05:52.981 --> 00:05:56.160
Sander what was to happen to them.

73
00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.690
Ultimately still had to be decided because the king of Persia claimed that

74
00:06:00.691 --> 00:06:02.970
territory still for his own.

75
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.180
The Spartans had really agreed to that in the treaties they made with the great

76
00:06:09.181 --> 00:06:10.900
king during the Peloponnesian War.

77
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.410
But now like Sandra I didn't see any reason for carrying out those promises and

78
00:06:16.411 --> 00:06:18.660
so there was at the very least conflict.

79
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.340
And of course what the cities would have liked best of all was to achieve

80
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.700
autonomy for themselves and they claimed that and regarded the rule either by

81
00:06:30.781 --> 00:06:35.781
Persian or by Spartan as improper and something to be resisted.

82
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:42.170
Well to suffer is the strap of the region of Libya and to the west the ones that

83
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.880
included the Greek cities attacked those cities which he claimed for the great

84
00:06:51.541 --> 00:06:56.541
king but which cities were holding out those cities in turn because the great

85
00:06:57.631 --> 00:07:02.160
menace to them for the moment was Persian turned to Sparta the great Victoria's

86
00:07:02.161 --> 00:07:04.590
power and asked the Spartans to help

87
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.200
and in the year four hundred three ninety nine the Spartans sent an army under a

88
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:17.681
general by the name of Cimarron who recruited about six thousand of those ten

89
00:07:20.321 --> 00:07:25.321
thousand men who had marched into the Persian Empire and who still saw its

90
00:07:25.371 --> 00:07:30.371
service as mercenaries rather than go home to poverty plus about 5000 or so

91
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.113
Peloponnesian.

92
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:40.390
All of the overseas activities of the Spartans in these years include

93
00:07:40.851 --> 00:07:42.830
practically no Spartans.

94
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:48.670
They are just too short of troops to be risking them in overseas ventures so

95
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.820
they use their Peloponnesian allies.

96
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.720
They sometimes use mercenaries and they

97
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.950
they also use some of these folks.

98
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.910
I told you about the last time who were neither this nor that.

99
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.380
This is the ones that they used on these campaigns are the ones that we are

100
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:14.770
calling neo demo days people who had been hell lots but who were liberated and

101
00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:21.590
permitted to fight for the Spartans and the notion of sending neo demo days

102
00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:26.450
overseas to fight was very attractive to the Spartans because it got them out of

103
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:31.500
Laconia.
For one thing and provided them with soldiers as well.

104
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:36.550
So that kind of army is the one that Cibrian is now using to fight against the

105
00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:41.861
Persians who just a few years ago had been the allies of the Spartans for

106
00:08:42.381 --> 00:08:45.680
control of the Greek cities of Asia Minor.

107
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:51.700
Now meanwhile we have to turn our attention excuse me to the sea and especially

108
00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:54.680
to the island of Cyprus.

109
00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.960
It's a Persian possession but on that island there are some cities that have a

110
00:08:59.961 --> 00:09:01.580
degree of autonomy one of them.

111
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:07.180
It has as its king a man called Vargas and he is very ambitious for himself and

112
00:09:12.321 --> 00:09:13.700
for the Cypriots.

113
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.510
<v 4>And so he is eager</v>

114
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:24.140
to fight against the Spartans on behalf of presumably on behalf of the great

115
00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:30.420
king although his motives are not made clear by our sources.

116
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.200
Reasonable Guesses that he may have hoped by achieving something great for the

117
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:41.661
great king he might receive back thanks from the great king in whatever form you

118
00:09:43.891 --> 00:09:48.030
can imagine it might be allowing him to rule over Cyprus it might mean to give

119
00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:48.864
him wealth.

120
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:53.930
Who knows but also on the island of Cyprus where he had taken refuge was the

121
00:09:56.131 --> 00:10:01.131
Athenian Admiral Conan who had been one of the admirals at the final defeat and

122
00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:06.291
Eagle's part of my he had escaped from that battle and had not gone home to

123
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.600
Athens he felt that the air there would not be healthy for somebody who lost the

124
00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:14.640
entire fleet at this part of mine.

125
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.500
And so he went to evangelists who who took good care of it.

126
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.470
Conan was a great sailor.

127
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:28.340
One of the very most distinguished admirals in Greek history and he too now

128
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:34.800
continued his feeling that Sparta was the enemy.

129
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.980
<v 2>So he joined evaporates and urging the great king to build a navy which would</v>

130
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:47.570
then defeat the Spartan Navy which would by itself rid Asia of the menace of

131
00:10:49.621 --> 00:10:54.621
Sparta and be a great thing for the Persians CONAN I suspect had some other

132
00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.840
hopes out of this activity which in fact will come to fruition.

133
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.490
I'll tell you about them in due course.

134
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.640
Well so now you have the Spartans have their fleet out there and the King agrees

135
00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:17.250
and he starts building a fleet of his own which will ultimately be a very large

136
00:11:17.251 --> 00:11:17.580
one.

137
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:22.580
Indeed some 300 ships and the King puts Conan on in charge of that fleet which

138
00:11:25.621 --> 00:11:30.621
is smart in a way because Cohen is a great Admiral maybe not so smart.

139
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.660
If you look at what Conan is really up to

140
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:40.250
in the face of these activities the Spartans decided to raise the ante and they

141
00:11:40.321 --> 00:11:45.321
sent an expedition into Asia Minor Tiburon had not done very well.

142
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:51.150
<v 3>And after about a year the Spartans replaced him with another general by the</v>

143
00:11:51.151 --> 00:11:56.151
name of their syllabus who does better but there is no decisive victory out

144
00:11:56.281 --> 00:11:58.410
there the war is dragging on.

145
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:04.190
And so they choose to send the new king just the.

146
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.850
Who is the son of ages.

147
00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:14.690
Who whose characteristics are among other things that he was born lame.

148
00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.480
He probably would not have been allowed to live.

149
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.480
Had he not come from the royal family.
But he did.

150
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:27.380
And he grew to be an ambitious aggressive Spartan king who I suspect I mean

151
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.670
cheap psychology.

152
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:38.030
<v 2>When you have a handicap like that in a society which values physical valour and</v>

153
00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:43.791
strength and military success so highly as the Spartans did you're twice as

154
00:12:44.731 --> 00:12:48.180
aggressive and twice as ambitious as an ordinary Spartan.

155
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.930
In any case that was the way a destiny is turned out to be.

156
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:57.930
Another interesting thing about it just layers is that he had been the the tenth

157
00:12:57.931 --> 00:13:02.931
mate of life Sandor and it's hard to believe that bystander could ever have

158
00:13:05.901 --> 00:13:08.190
achieved the eminence that he did.

159
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:13.210
The command that was given to him had he not been a friend of the young man that

160
00:13:14.121 --> 00:13:17.860
people looked to as the next king or possibly the next king.

161
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:23.370
But as he had to adjust the layers had was used as you being much younger man

162
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.620
than life Sander he seemed to be deferential and everything was OK.

163
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.830
And so he was very keen on doing what the Spartans did which was to send a

164
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:37.910
display is out with a new expedition to win the war against the Persians out

165
00:13:38.131 --> 00:13:39.910
there just like this.

166
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:45.080
It is plain had extremely lofty plans for himself and for this expedition and

167
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:53.750
the way the the the way the expedition worked just lays chose to leave with his

168
00:13:56.101 --> 00:14:01.101
fleet from the town of Alice which is located in biosphere does anybody

169
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:08.900
recognize the name and think why it just later should have wanted to leave from

170
00:14:08.901 --> 00:14:09.734
Alice.

171
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:20.120
<v 3>That's right.
Agamemnon took off for the Trojan War at Alice.</v>

172
00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.130
<v 5>And you remember how the legend goes.</v>

173
00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.290
Shit the winds were against the Greeks they wouldn't let the ships get away and

174
00:14:27.291 --> 00:14:32.291
they asked him a holy man to tell them what the gods were up to and the gods

175
00:14:32.661 --> 00:14:37.661
said Well they you can't go until you sacrifice your daughter your little

176
00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:39.050
daughter.

177
00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:43.070
<v 6>If a denier
to the gods for that purpose.</v>

178
00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:48.100
<v 2>So Agamemnon did and the winds relented and Agamemnon would pay the price when</v>

179
00:14:49.341 --> 00:14:54.341
he got back from Troy but it is precisely that the Greek fleet against the

180
00:14:56.281 --> 00:15:00.960
barbarian against the non Greeks the most important ones and all of their

181
00:15:00.961 --> 00:15:02.430
legends namely the Trojans.

182
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000
<v 5>It was at all hours that they left and Agamemnon excuse me I just alas wanted to</v>

183
00:15:09.211 --> 00:15:14.211
bring that to the my he was the new Agamemnon and he was not leading a Spartan

184
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:21.300
or a fleet against the Persians he was the spokesman for the Greeks he was the

185
00:15:24.451 --> 00:15:29.451
leader of the Greeks revenge thing that original offense whatever that might be.

186
00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:36.830
He was trying to make the case for a pan hellenic motive for what was absolutely

187
00:15:36.871 --> 00:15:41.871
a strictly Spartan one and raising himself to a legendary level practically.

188
00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:48.340
<v 4>Well that turned out to be a mistake because the seasons happened at that moment</v>

189
00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:53.781
to be as far as we can tell led by a faction that was very hostile to the

190
00:15:54.931 --> 00:15:59.931
Spartans so as adjust the place as people were setting up the altars for

191
00:16:00.811 --> 00:16:05.811
sacrifices before they took off along the road came a thieving army knocked over

192
00:16:06.751 --> 00:16:10.350
all of the altars and asked them who the hell invited him in to be OCA in the

193
00:16:10.351 --> 00:16:15.351
first place to get the hell out of there grossly insulting adjusts the place and

194
00:16:16.591 --> 00:16:21.591
forcing him to skulk out of this not in the grand way that he had imagined.

195
00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:27.720
This turned out to be very significant but just the place took it personally.

196
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:32.970
<v 6>He didn't like that and I suppose.
Well never mind.</v>

197
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.910
It's about to make a bad joke.
Let it go.

198
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:43.780
And it had an enormous impact on him because for the rest of his life.

199
00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:49.530
<v 4>I just Elias will be hostile to thieves and when he could he would promote a</v>

200
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:56.970
policy of attacking thieves of trying to defeat it to subjected to Sparta and a

201
00:16:58.241 --> 00:17:03.241
whole piece of Spartan foreign policy which was to be very costly and damaging

202
00:17:03.251 --> 00:17:08.251
to Sparta was the result of a just delays his attempt at vendetta against the

203
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:14.010
seaman's
well.

204
00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:19.140
<v 3>He goes to Asia and begins to encounter the Persians he does pretty well as</v>

205
00:17:19.301 --> 00:17:22.870
always Greek hop lights if they can get the Persians to fight them in a nice

206
00:17:22.871 --> 00:17:23.990
flat field beat them.

207
00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:29.760
<v 7>And he did that on several occasions but he was never able to bring a large</v>

208
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:35.070
force of Persians to battle so that he could really destroy a good chunk of

209
00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:41.221
Persian power in the region so that the victories were not decisive they could

210
00:17:41.711 --> 00:17:42.740
not win the war.

211
00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.990
He could win the battles but you couldn't win the war at least he didn't.

212
00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:53.560
<v 4>Meanwhile things turned round against the Spartans of from the side that you</v>

213
00:17:55.941 --> 00:17:58.940
might expect that is to say from the see

214
00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:06.580
Konate with the Persian fleet sailed against the very important island of Rhodes

215
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:13.930
and captured it brought it back to took it away from the Spartans in any case

216
00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:16.460
where the Spartans went.

217
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:21.490
You will remember they established oligarchic governments and in this case the

218
00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:27.640
victorious Athenian Admiral removed the oligarchic government and in its place

219
00:18:28.311 --> 00:18:30.080
there rose up a democracy.

220
00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.320
I'm sure the great king didn't care what kind of a regime it was for the moment.

221
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.900
He just wanted to get rid of the Spartans which he did.

222
00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:42.670
<v 3>But it was of course on the greek scene it was a great defeat for the Spartans</v>

223
00:18:44.091 --> 00:18:48.320
and it was a challenge to the Spartans it was obvious that Conan at least and

224
00:18:48.321 --> 00:18:50.270
who knew what might happen from.

225
00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.980
<v 2>On the part of other Greeks were going to resist Spartan power and Spartan</v>

226
00:18:54.981 --> 00:18:59.720
aggressiveness and that if he wanted to come back them he would have to have a

227
00:18:59.721 --> 00:19:04.721
navy and the Spartans set out to increase their navy to meet this challenge.

228
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:10.370
And just to look ahead a few years I think we need to at this moment

229
00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:17.020
it was that Spartan fleet that Conan defeated thoroughly and decisively a few

230
00:19:19.371 --> 00:19:24.371
years later in three ninety four at the Battle of Coney dogs and which really

231
00:19:27.501 --> 00:19:30.350
puts an end for considerable time.

232
00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:35.860
The whole idea of Sparta fighting at sea entirely it really means that.

233
00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:37.933
That.

234
00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.840
<v 1>Approach remember we were talking last time about different the three different</v>

235
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:46.160
possibilities that the Spartans had to choose among.

236
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:50.330
And they chose for a while this thoroughly aggressive one overseas that's out.

237
00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.230
Now if you're been defeated at sea you don't have a navy that can challenge your

238
00:19:54.231 --> 00:19:55.760
opponents.
You can't do it.

239
00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:59.120
And as a matter of fact that will not be very much longer.

240
00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:04.540
When events in Greece compel them to withdraw their army under a just alliance

241
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:10.390
and bring them back home and no Spartan army ever goes back to Asia again that

242
00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:16.540
we're looking ahead but that the action that caused that was the victory at

243
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:18.683
Canada's

244
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:25.990
now of course with the Spartans being defeated in that part of the world the

245
00:20:26.901 --> 00:20:31.730
Greek cities that have been under Spartan rule now typically rebel against the

246
00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:32.570
Spartan rule.

247
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:37.790
<v 4>And we must imagine that for a few years there are really quite confused</v>

248
00:20:37.791 --> 00:20:40.940
conditions in Asiatic Greece.

249
00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:47.140
Some places may have continued to be under Spartan rule some may have continued

250
00:20:47.781 --> 00:20:52.781
to be under Persian rule no doubt about it some of them became autonomous.

251
00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.650
We just don't know what the numbers were.

252
00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.340
And there could have been mixtures of things going on too.

253
00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:03.690
I make that point because when later on final settlement is produced there.

254
00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:11.050
It is imposed upon a condition of confusion rather than simply overthrowing a

255
00:21:12.861 --> 00:21:16.580
single thing that was characteristic across the board.

256
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:22.990
Still many of those towns as I say did return to Persian rule as well.

257
00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:29.570
That's the situation for which leads us to the next great event in holiness

258
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:32.190
history across the board.

259
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:37.580
The currency and war as it is called which breaks out in three ninety five and

260
00:21:38.281 --> 00:21:43.281
runs down to three eighty seven six so-called because the bulk of the fighting

261
00:21:44.071 --> 00:21:49.071
on land was around the city of Khans but it was it was a war that engaged all of

262
00:21:53.941 --> 00:21:58.941
the major cities of Greece right around its core and its center.

263
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:05.510
I think the fair a fair way to see it is the cause of that war was in its most

264
00:22:07.991 --> 00:22:12.991
fundamental sense Sparta tyrannical behavior towards the other Greek cities

265
00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.770
which produces a variety of reactions.

266
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.570
Let me remind you of some and tell you about some others that we haven't talked

267
00:22:22.571 --> 00:22:23.180
about.

268
00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:27.670
You remember there was these grievances that lingered from the end of the

269
00:22:27.671 --> 00:22:32.671
Peloponnesian War when Spartan allies like Corinth and Thebes had been very

270
00:22:34.091 --> 00:22:37.660
dissatisfied with the way the booty had been shared.

271
00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.930
That came from the defeat of the Athenians.

272
00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:45.190
And you remember those two cities were aggrieved also because the Spartans

273
00:22:45.191 --> 00:22:50.110
ignored their wishes as to what should happen to Athens and went their own way.

274
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.033
There too.

275
00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:55.870
I think I mentioned as well that in all contexts with non Spartans in this

276
00:22:55.871 --> 00:23:00.871
period the Spartans seem to be very arrogant very hard to get along with and

277
00:23:01.211 --> 00:23:06.211
they certainly inspire considerable unhappiness and discontent.

278
00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:12.580
<v 3>Those things you know about now in FORERO To the Spartans</v>

279
00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:19.120
launched a war against the polis of Eilis located up in the northwestern corner

280
00:23:20.001 --> 00:23:20.890
of the Peloponnese.

281
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:26.770
<v 8>Olympia is included in that area just to help you fix it in your mind.</v>

282
00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:34.120
Now the Spartans call upon their allies to join them in this expedition as is

283
00:23:36.681 --> 00:23:37.370
their right.

284
00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:41.060
According to the traditional rules of the game in the Peloponnesian league

285
00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:46.220
Thebes and Corinth refuse to send their contingents.

286
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.710
That is practically

287
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.900
an act of rebellion against the Spartans.

288
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:58.930
<v 1>It's a violation of their treaty agreements and it shows you how much irritation</v>

289
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:05.510
there existed between them and the whole the whole campaign seemed to these

290
00:24:05.511 --> 00:24:09.560
states very annoying because why were these Spartans attacking Ellis partly

291
00:24:09.561 --> 00:24:14.561
because they had a continuing debate conflict with them about a border town.

292
00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:20.660
<v 3>It's the old stuff but also I think as an act of revenge because the aliens had</v>

293
00:24:21.441 --> 00:24:26.441
been disloyal during the Peloponnesian War during the peace of Nicky after for

294
00:24:26.621 --> 00:24:31.621
twenty one Ellis was one of the four democracies that joined up in this new

295
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:38.950
separate league that ended up fighting against the Spartans for a period of time

296
00:24:39.081 --> 00:24:43.580
in the great battle of Manzanita in which the very existence of Sparta was at

297
00:24:43.581 --> 00:24:44.414
issue.

298
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.720
<v 4>Ellis was on the side of the enemies of Sparta so that was why the Spartans</v>

299
00:24:50.541 --> 00:24:54.470
suddenly decided to attack them and the Allies didn't think that was right.

300
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.600
The ones who were discontented in any case

301
00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:03.770
so that's in the background and all these other irritations that I have

302
00:25:03.871 --> 00:25:04.704
mentioned.

303
00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:09.090
But it wasn't enough because even if you were as mad as you could be at the

304
00:25:09.091 --> 00:25:14.091
Spartans and determined to try to undo their effort at hegemony over the Greeks

305
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:20.750
there was no easy way to think of fighting them successfully.

306
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:26.630
All of these states that were discontented Thebes Carnes and as we will quickly

307
00:25:27.301 --> 00:25:32.301
see Athens as well were isolated from each other they didn't belong to any

308
00:25:32.851 --> 00:25:37.851
common activity and they all were not as strong enough individually to take on

309
00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:41.610
the Spartans.

310
00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.050
<v 7>Moreover there was the problem.</v>

311
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:48.080
If you wanted to fight these people it would require money and all of them were

312
00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:51.180
short of funds for that purpose.

313
00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:56.210
<v 8>So the critical element necessary to create a coalition that could undertake a</v>

314
00:25:58.531 --> 00:25:59.460
war against Sparta

315
00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.050
that decision was made by the Persians.

316
00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:10.370
<v 7>The king of Persia presumably although it very much looks like the new SAT</v>

317
00:26:11.851 --> 00:26:16.770
trapped in that region that to a to set traps in the western part of the Persian

318
00:26:16.771 --> 00:26:21.480
Empire remember the one whose capital is at Sardi's in Libya and the one whose

319
00:26:21.481 --> 00:26:26.481
capital or whose territory is along the helos Ponce and the Straits in general

320
00:26:27.151 --> 00:26:31.980
find a basis our old friends run of bases from the Peloponnesian War and a new

321
00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.660
set trap in Sardi's.

322
00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:40.280
<v 4>Both want this to happen and so they find a road in Greek and give him a batch</v>

323
00:26:45.211 --> 00:26:50.211
of money and send him to the Greek cities seeking out those factional leaders

324
00:26:53.521 --> 00:26:58.521
who were known to be hostile to Sparta and offering to give them them some of

325
00:26:59.791 --> 00:27:04.260
the money that he was carrying which was not in itself a vast amount and

326
00:27:04.261 --> 00:27:08.790
certainly not enough to fight any war but was obviously a sign of good faith

327
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:14.330
saying the king of Persia and his sad traps in this region are against the

328
00:27:15.421 --> 00:27:20.280
Spartans and would like for you to put an end to the things you don't like that

329
00:27:20.281 --> 00:27:25.281
are happening in the Greek world and he will support you with his money.

330
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:30.000
That I think turned out to be an absolutely critical act.

331
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:35.420
He went out to a town I have not mentioned that belongs in the company of the

332
00:27:36.061 --> 00:27:41.061
anti Spartan people at this point of course is our gods the traditional enemy of

333
00:27:41.791 --> 00:27:45.810
Sparta running back at least into the 8th century and perhaps further than that

334
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:51.090
with who seemed to find themselves in a war with the Spartans at least once a

335
00:27:51.091 --> 00:27:55.560
century and it looks like this is the time in the 4th century for them.

336
00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:01.260
August is a democracy too and as you know that is a relevant fact.

337
00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:07.490
<v 7>Currency is not a democracy but they are so angry they want to play too and they</v>

338
00:28:07.831 --> 00:28:10.260
join up thieves again.

339
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.310
It's hard to tell what the government is it looks throughout this entire period

340
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:19.700
as oligarchy and democracy may well have been very close to one another so that

341
00:28:20.341 --> 00:28:25.341
any time one faction or the other may have the upper hand and of course Athens

342
00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:27.940
which is a democracy again.

343
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:32.990
Now the Athenians have been very very reluctant to do anything to annoy the

344
00:28:33.301 --> 00:28:35.160
Spartans for very good reasons.

345
00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:40.790
They have no navy they have no walls and they have no money so to buck the

346
00:28:42.121 --> 00:28:45.820
Spartans would be an act almost of suicide because all the Spartans need to do

347
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:48.990
is come marching into Attica and they have no defense.

348
00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:52.660
Up to now therefore they've been very very careful not to annoy.

349
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:57.710
In fact in four 0 2 when the sequence in the Corinthians refused to go to Ellis

350
00:28:59.341 --> 00:29:04.341
with the Spartans the Athenians sent their force as they were required to do by

351
00:29:05.041 --> 00:29:06.360
their treaty with the Spartans.

352
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:11.960
But the new situation changed things and Athens just as it did perhaps even more

353
00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.790
than it did in other cities.

354
00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:19.650
Now the great king the Persians were not the enemy the Persians were going to

355
00:29:19.651 --> 00:29:24.170
support the war if they were ready to launch it against the.

356
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:27.380
The Spartans.
There was no war yet.

357
00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:31.650
I should point out when this money is being handed out this is an effort to stir

358
00:29:31.651 --> 00:29:33.630
up that kind of activity.

359
00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:39.560
Of course the enemies of the policy referred to these these transfers of money

360
00:29:39.751 --> 00:29:44.751
as bribes and there's no nothing in Greek practice or break Greek tradition to

361
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:52.310
reject the idea that some of these Persian coins ended up in the pockets of the

362
00:29:53.101 --> 00:29:55.760
men that they were given to.

363
00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:59.400
But I don't think we really should think of them as bribes.

364
00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:04.770
Most of the money was used for the purpose for which it was intended to help

365
00:30:04.771 --> 00:30:09.771
these leaders stir up support for a war against Sparta.

366
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:12.590
<v 8>It was something they believed in anyway.</v>

367
00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.960
It was a source of their ability to carry out their wishes but as I say did.

368
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.110
The Greeks didn't think there was anything wrong with picking up a few bucks

369
00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:25.500
along the way.
Now.

370
00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:31.820
A war breaks out on the frontier between forces and local risk to towns in

371
00:30:35.311 --> 00:30:40.311
central Greece both of which are quite close to Bosnia.

372
00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:43.510
The land ruled by the thieves

373
00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:50.300
the Spartans and I think this was probably well I'm pretty confident that it

374
00:30:50.671 --> 00:30:51.504
was.

375
00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:57.220
What this motivated by the Spartan unhappiness about Thebes.

376
00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:02.870
The Spartans assist forces against locusts knowing that Thebes is allied to

377
00:31:05.661 --> 00:31:08.210
locusts and that this would be.

378
00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.180
<v 9>They believed and hope a pretext for war.</v>

379
00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:15.470
This was their chance to get even with the seasons for all the things that the

380
00:31:15.471 --> 00:31:20.471
seasons had done that irritated them since the war so Sparta invaded the OCA.

381
00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:27.470
Their strategy to win this war was that they would invade beyond from two sides

382
00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:32.330
one army coming from central Greece from the region of focus and Locus where

383
00:31:32.331 --> 00:31:37.331
they were assisting the oceans and another army being sent up from the

384
00:31:39.051 --> 00:31:40.580
Peloponnese itself.

385
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:46.380
They do finally meet in three ninety five at a town in western B ocean called

386
00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:51.400
Halley arches where there is a battle and where by the way lies Sandor is killed

387
00:31:55.370 --> 00:32:00.370
in the fighting and removed from the sea but even before that happened.

388
00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:06.300
As it was clear that the Spartans meant to fight the sea the sea beans went to

389
00:32:07.481 --> 00:32:10.450
Athens and asked the Athenians for help.

390
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:13.870
And of course they had a case that was very attractive.

391
00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:18.900
<v 7>First of all it certainly reminded the Athenians of the role Thebes had played</v>

392
00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:24.690
in liberating Athens by giving a home to thrash the bullies and his free

393
00:32:26.201 --> 00:32:31.201
Athenians when they were in the position of defeating the thirty tyrants and

394
00:32:31.421 --> 00:32:32.254
driving them out.

395
00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.520
I have a feeling they didn't remind the Athenians about that little Congress

396
00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:40.270
they had after the war in which they suggested that they destroy all the

397
00:32:40.271 --> 00:32:45.271
Athenians and take away their land and turn the whole place into a great big

398
00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:46.503
cattle farm.

399
00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:51.840
I think they probably didn't remember to mention that but but they had that

400
00:32:51.881 --> 00:32:54.070
reason.
But more important than that was what they were saying.

401
00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:59.760
You have a chance now to escape from your bondage to the Spartans where the

402
00:33:00.101 --> 00:33:05.101
Athenians certainly were and to re-establish yourself as an autonomous Polis

403
00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:10.540
along with us and all the others who want to take away power from the Spartans

404
00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:15.840
which they are abusing so terribly now the remarkable thing to me is that

405
00:33:16.421 --> 00:33:19.540
Xenophon who very likely was their.

406
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Reports that the Athenian Assembly voted unanimously in favor Well it's worth

407
00:33:29.571 --> 00:33:33.870
pointing out of course that the number one advocate of doing that.

408
00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:38.890
Of joining the rebellion against and against Sparta was threats of bullies.

409
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:45.190
The great hero of the time that certainly made a big difference and threats of

410
00:33:45.921 --> 00:33:50.921
bullies had been one of the cautious leaders before who had been against getting

411
00:33:51.051 --> 00:33:55.190
these Spartans mad because he knew Athens was in incompetent incompetent to

412
00:33:55.191 --> 00:34:00.191
fight them now but with the Persian support and with the prospect of forming a

413
00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:06.520
coalition against Sparta the strategic situation had changed and threats of

414
00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:08.670
bullies now came out 100 percent for the war.

415
00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:12.470
<v 8>But unanimous vote in favor of the war.</v>

416
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:17.750
I can't imagine the Athenian Assembly giving unanimous vote in favor of getting

417
00:34:17.751 --> 00:34:18.680
a drink of water.

418
00:34:19.910 --> 00:34:23.600
It's just so incredible to me so how do I explain.

419
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:25.610
Well I gotta make it up.

420
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:29.990
I think there was an overwhelming sentiment in favor.

421
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:34.040
Obviously the attractions were great but there were reasons to fear if you lose

422
00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:35.990
the price could be very very high.

423
00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:41.590
But I think what happened was that the emotion was so strong that at the moment

424
00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:47.170
that once it was evident that there was a large majority in favor of the motion

425
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:52.520
nobody wanted to be seen as being against it.

426
00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:57.850
It would have had the look of cowardice of a lack of patriotism and people in

427
00:34:58.701 --> 00:35:00.890
these circumstances it has been my experience.

428
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:06.550
Hate to seem not to be going along when everybody is enthusiastically going in a

429
00:35:08.031 --> 00:35:13.031
particular direction so that's how I interpret Xenophon's remarkable testimony.

430
00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.870
But whatever whatever it is the truth of it.

431
00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:21.950
What is clear is that great enthusiasm overwhelming majority.

432
00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:27.280
They are prepared to fight for their true autonomy in the war to come.

433
00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:34.050
So the Coalition is finally for Athens thieves.

434
00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:37.670
Cars are gone.
Those are the main states on the mainland.

435
00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:40.370
They'll do most of the fighting but it's worth pointing out

436
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:43.830
that there are other places that join too.

437
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:49.220
You'll be to the island to the east of Attica.
Not surprising.

438
00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:53.290
They're so thoroughly influenced by the Athenians that's not a great surprise

439
00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:58.170
but it's interesting that many a town up in the north of the Aegean on the child

440
00:35:58.171 --> 00:36:03.171
cities see also joined in this anti Spartan coalition and likewise the region in

441
00:36:06.081 --> 00:36:10.570
the West and not on the Ionian Sea of car Narnia.

442
00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:15.970
Also join which I think suggests that there was quite a lot of anti Spartan

443
00:36:16.701 --> 00:36:21.701
sentiments in the Greek world at this time which you know very often comes about

444
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:28.690
if any state seems to be too strong too too.

445
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:36.400
Too powerful too much of a threat to what everybody else wants.

446
00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:37.960
People tend to cut it down.

447
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:42.990
Political scientists tend to formalize this into the notion of.

448
00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.593
What you call it.

449
00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:51.730
If you join up with the most powerful state it's called bandwagon.

450
00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.060
What do they call bandwagon.

451
00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:57.210
What do they call it if if you're against the balancing that's the worry.

452
00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.190
Sorry I'm weak in my political science technology.

453
00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.690
Yeah balancing is what's supposed to be the truth of the matter is that you

454
00:37:04.691 --> 00:37:07.620
never can tell which way the state states will go in these situations.

455
00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:11.320
There you are but in this case though I'm simply making the point that there was

456
00:37:11.321 --> 00:37:14.710
a lot of hostility to Sparta out there and some people you wouldn't think of

457
00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:15.850
joined in this.

458
00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:20.850
But it's the big four that really matter and they do most of the fighting in the

459
00:37:21.221 --> 00:37:23.160
war well.

460
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:28.590
There's no point in going through the war in great detail just a few highlights

461
00:37:28.591 --> 00:37:30.150
I think need to be mentioned.

462
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.960
The largest highlight of all being how in the world is supposed to win this war.

463
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:38.160
What is the the the strategy on each side.

464
00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:41.490
And it's remarkable how similar they are.

465
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:47.150
The Spartans want to gain control of the Isthmus of currents its currents and

466
00:37:48.991 --> 00:37:53.991
mega especially so that they can get out into central Greece and defeat their

467
00:37:56.490 --> 00:38:01.440
opponents individually and B O show for this evens and Atika for the Athenians

468
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:05.370
and currents of course right there in the Isthmus.

469
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:08.830
The other folks are there.

470
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:13.880
The big four want to push into the Peloponnese is where they can raise up the

471
00:38:15.361 --> 00:38:16.680
rebellion of the

472
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:23.240
harlots and the pari oi oi and defeat the Spartans right there and strip away

473
00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:25.500
their allies in the Peloponnese.

474
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:30.710
So each side basically has to gain control of the Isthmus and then move forward

475
00:38:32.941 --> 00:38:36.460
to carry out the conclusion of the war in their favor.

476
00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:42.260
And the bottom line is neither side is able to do it the bulk of the fighting

477
00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:50.140
throughout the years of that war surround the city of Corinth.

478
00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:55.580
<v 10>Walls are put up by the Corinthians meant to keep the Spartans out.</v>

479
00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:57.740
They do so for a great chunk of time.

480
00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:02.300
The Spartans can take part of the walls but they can't manage to take everything

481
00:39:02.301 --> 00:39:03.230
into punch through.

482
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:08.300
And so for all these years that's what happens there are some big battles that

483
00:39:08.301 --> 00:39:13.301
are fought this one and 394 soon after the beginning of the war at Noumea which

484
00:39:14.601 --> 00:39:18.120
is located to the south of sea of currents.

485
00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:24.100
<v 8>It's a very big tough standard hop like battle both sides having strong armies</v>

486
00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:31.420
both sides fighting well and determinedly the Spartans technically winning.

487
00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:35.480
It's one of those victories where you know who won because they put up the

488
00:39:35.481 --> 00:39:39.320
trophy and they were able to collect their dead and the other guys had to ask

489
00:39:39.321 --> 00:39:43.010
permission to come to collect their debt but it was another one of these

490
00:39:43.011 --> 00:39:47.450
victories that did not have strategic consequences neither side had been able to

491
00:39:47.451 --> 00:39:48.380
destroy the other.

492
00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:53.410
Neither side could now advance into the region that they had to get to in order

493
00:39:54.471 --> 00:39:59.471
to make a difference so that I think is the major story of that war.

494
00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:05.750
There's another side.
Another.

495
00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:10.850
Event in there that has interesting consequences for a future Greek warfare that

496
00:40:10.851 --> 00:40:15.851
deserves mentioning at a certain point in that war the Athenians under an

497
00:40:18.621 --> 00:40:23.621
extraordinary general by the name of difficulties had put together a force of

498
00:40:26.271 --> 00:40:31.271
light armed troops not hot lights people without hot line armor and shields who

499
00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:37.940
threw missiles at the other side.

500
00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:43.600
Probably mainly slingers but they also would have been spear throwers throwers

501
00:40:43.821 --> 00:40:48.170
not thrusters.
And Bowman.

502
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:53.780
And these guys could never confront the Phalanx in a normal way and they would

503
00:40:53.781 --> 00:40:57.930
normally and having to be able to do much harm in an extraordinary way.

504
00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.353
But.

505
00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:04.630
That what was new was that a fix whities had trained them as a professional

506
00:41:05.631 --> 00:41:06.464
force.

507
00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:12.280
So they could move swiftly and together as a body in such a way as to be as

508
00:41:13.761 --> 00:41:18.761
effective as it was possible for light on troops to be against and a phalanx.

509
00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:25.450
And it happened that difficulties was able to maneuver a whole division of

510
00:41:27.351 --> 00:41:31.760
Spartan soldiers in such a way that they got stuck.

511
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:37.270
In a dead end in a cool de sac and were absolutely victimized by difficulties

512
00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:46.900
light armed forces and about 600 men making up this division of the Spartan army

513
00:41:48.561 --> 00:41:50.570
called the division is called a.

514
00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:56.380
You were wiped out and the Greek world was astonished by this because no such

515
00:41:58.611 --> 00:42:00.440
thing had ever happened before.

516
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:06.730
And it led to the increased use of well-trained light armored infantry will play

517
00:42:09.051 --> 00:42:09.950
a larger role.

518
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:15.400
They never replace the Phalanx as the major form of land warfare but they things

519
00:42:16.941 --> 00:42:21.140
become more complicated in the fourth century as they have already begun to be

520
00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:26.240
in the Peloponnesian War as you have different branches that are able to perform

521
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:30.770
more usefully than they were typically expected to do in the past.

522
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:40.450
<v 10>I mean perhaps as big an event as any that occurred in that war was the event I</v>

523
00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:47.740
mentioned earlier Conan using the Persian fleet defeating the Spartan fleet at

524
00:42:51.711 --> 00:42:52.550
the Battle of

525
00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:56.860
anybody take a note.

526
00:42:56.990 --> 00:43:01.660
It's just gone out of my mind can he does can he does it 394.

527
00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:03.953
But what does he do.

528
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:09.470
CONAN takes his victorious fleet sails back to Athens the Athenians have already

529
00:43:11.761 --> 00:43:14.370
begun the process of rebuilding their walls.

530
00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:19.730
But now with the help of Conan's men and the money that he carries and gives to

531
00:43:19.891 --> 00:43:24.360
them they are building those walls at a much faster clip.

532
00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:29.410
And before the war is over the Athenians will once again be a walled city with a

533
00:43:29.491 --> 00:43:32.820
walled port and with long walls connecting them.

534
00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:37.940
In other words the bases for having an independent naval policy will be in place

535
00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:44.480
thanks to Conan's victory on top of which he takes the Persian fleet and goes to

536
00:43:45.211 --> 00:43:50.211
the Athenians and says it is now your fleet and suddenly the Athenians have

537
00:43:50.281 --> 00:43:54.900
again probably the biggest fleet in the Greek world just like that.

538
00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:01.570
Similarly or rather as a consequence of all this because for a while at least

539
00:44:01.571 --> 00:44:05.770
they are able to dominate the Aegean Sea with these forces and with Conan around

540
00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:10.840
they regain those famous islands that are so crucial to them.

541
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:15.990
The stepping stones to the Hellas Ponte Leno's embrace scare us become Athenian

542
00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:19.293
owned again.

543
00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:24.400
They also gain control of the sacred island of Apollo at Delors.

544
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:29.890
They also make an alliance with the important island of chaos.

545
00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:35.670
And suddenly you have what are the just the bare beginnings of the

546
00:44:36.701 --> 00:44:41.440
reconstruction of the old Athenian naval alliance.

547
00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.480
You might want to call it an empire.

548
00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:48.900
Let me make it very clear that even when they become far more powerful in years

549
00:44:49.571 --> 00:44:54.190
to come they are never able to recreate the old Athenian Empire.

550
00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:59.760
They never reached the point which was so decisive for their power where it is

551
00:45:01.571 --> 00:45:06.571
truly an empire where almost every state in the league is contributing money

552
00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:13.650
which allows the Athenians to not only build but to sustain in peacetime and

553
00:45:14.651 --> 00:45:19.140
wartime.
The biggest navy and the best navy around.

554
00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:23.000
They never get there.
They do become very important as a naval power again.

555
00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:25.810
They are going to be a very significant state again.

556
00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:30.220
But even though they are turning in that other direction they never get there.

557
00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:33.640
But I think we need to remember that probably there's a very good chunk of the

558
00:45:33.641 --> 00:45:38.641
Athenians who regard those days as the good old days and as the natural state of

559
00:45:39.671 --> 00:45:44.080
things and is the place to which they ought to be going towards that empire.

560
00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:48.640
Certainly a lot of their behavior in the Corinthian war and afterwards suggests

561
00:45:48.641 --> 00:45:50.710
that that was a widespread opinion.

562
00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:56.400
There was undoubtedly also hostility to that opinion as people look back on the

563
00:45:57.911 --> 00:46:01.330
experience of what happened last time look at the look at the consequences.

564
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:07.710
There were important socio economic political significance of pursuing such a

565
00:46:08.321 --> 00:46:11.140
policy.
It meant democracy.

566
00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:16.300
That meant the naval democracy it meant the most extreme democracy and a lot of

567
00:46:16.301 --> 00:46:21.301
people's memories especially those of the rich were of mistakes and defeats that

568
00:46:22.781 --> 00:46:24.550
that democracy had brought about.

569
00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:30.330
When you read Plato particularly about the Athenian democracy or even Aristotle

570
00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:36.690
I think you have to remember that these people were very very critical of what

571
00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:43.210
the Athenian democracy had done in the 5th century.

572
00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:48.390
Blame the democracy for that defeat and then that was tied up with their

573
00:46:49.091 --> 00:46:54.091
political views in general that democracy was a very bad wicked thing and that

574
00:46:55.151 --> 00:46:59.560
that should help you understand this very strong bias against democratic

575
00:46:59.561 --> 00:47:02.050
government on the part of such people

576
00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:10.240
another special events in the course of the Corinthian war which would have some

577
00:47:10.241 --> 00:47:14.530
consequence for greek life later on during that war.

578
00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:19.930
There was a union between the cities of Corinth and Argos

579
00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:26.520
it was brought about by a special emergency situation created by the war in

580
00:47:26.711 --> 00:47:30.130
which all the fighting was around Corinth in which there was terrible

581
00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:35.670
destruction of Corinthian property in which poverty came to be a problem.

582
00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:41.170
Currency in a way that it had never been.
There was a topsy turvy situation.

583
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:46.430
It had been throughout the whole fifth century back into the sixth century an

584
00:47:47.081 --> 00:47:52.081
oligarchic government a broad oligarchic government one that was widely thought

585
00:47:52.091 --> 00:47:57.091
to be a good government and that so far as we know was never touched until

586
00:47:58.301 --> 00:48:03.040
sometime here in the currency in war when these extreme conditions produced what

587
00:48:03.041 --> 00:48:08.041
looks like a Democratic faction which seized power which murdered the leaders of

588
00:48:09.611 --> 00:48:13.660
the opposition in a brutal way by the way on a holy day.

589
00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:19.840
<v 8>It was a memorable and horrible event.
So.</v>

590
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:21.783
It was.

591
00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:27.240
After that event had taken place that you see this union between our gods which

592
00:48:28.961 --> 00:48:33.961
is a democracy and this democratic government in Corinth which is under siege

593
00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:36.940
for the reasons that I've suggested

594
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:43.750
and what they do is they arrange for a new situation where citizens of one state

595
00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:46.500
will be citizens of the other as well.

596
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:51.080
<v 11>So theoretically if you lived in currents and you wanted to go to Argos to sit</v>

597
00:48:51.081 --> 00:48:54.620
in on the hour drive assembly you could do it and vice versa.

598
00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:57.850
This is something absolutely new.

599
00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:03.360
The idea of anything but a polis being by itself or being on top of other polls.

600
00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:10.380
But the notion of there being a sharing of a regime Interpol's sharing of of

601
00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:16.440
governmental responsibilities is really new and it becomes more usual in the

602
00:49:17.651 --> 00:49:20.950
course of the next century and the century after that.

603
00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:25.570
This one hardly lasts at all it's just a few years as a consequence of the war

604
00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:27.820
and it's undone at the end of the war.

605
00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:32.860
But it's an indication of what people might be thinking about and we shall see

606
00:49:32.861 --> 00:49:34.510
that in the course of this century.

607
00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:39.340
There will grow up federations that's something different.

608
00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:40.510
But still it's the same thing.

609
00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:45.720
In a way a federation is a political union that allows for the maintenance of

610
00:49:47.261 --> 00:49:52.261
local powers on the part of the original members but also take some powers for a

611
00:49:54.131 --> 00:49:59.080
central body which is made up of more than one.

612
00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:04.030
<v 12>We Americans of course have some idea about that but there was there was the</v>

613
00:50:04.031 --> 00:50:08.330
Arcadian league that came into being and the king league that came into being.

614
00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:12.820
Being in the totally League which came into being and as a matter of fact our

615
00:50:12.821 --> 00:50:17.821
founding fathers read very carefully about these experiments in federal

616
00:50:19.451 --> 00:50:23.050
government as they were writing the American Constitution.

617
00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:28.080
<v 11>We have hard evidence about that the best evidence for those confederations does</v>

618
00:50:31.361 --> 00:50:35.470
not occur in our period it occurs later typically in the third and the second

619
00:50:35.471 --> 00:50:40.471
centuries B.C. and the accounts of them are in the works of plebeians.

620
00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:45.910
If you're ever interested so plebeian it was a very important figure for the

621
00:50:45.911 --> 00:50:46.744
American.

622
00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:52.500
Founding Fathers who wrote the Constitution but the first seed of this kind of

623
00:50:52.691 --> 00:50:57.691
interstate cooperation on a basis that was not merely alliance but was co

624
00:50:59.411 --> 00:51:04.411
citizenship is in the case of Corinth and August in the course of this war.

625
00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:07.900
Well as the war dragged on.

626
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:13.710
<v 10>It became clearer and clearer that neither side had any way of prevailing.</v>

627
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:19.750
But another thing that happened that was to play a very important part in how

628
00:51:19.751 --> 00:51:24.751
the war came to an end was that the Athenian control of the Sea was rapidly

629
00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:31.530
making Athens stronger and stronger and more like that scary thing which Athens

630
00:51:32.801 --> 00:51:37.450
had been to its neighbors and its opponents in the fifth century B.C..

631
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:42.990
Such that the Persians who after all had started the war by virtue of

632
00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:50.050
encouraging the anti Spartan factions to get together and it had been supporting

633
00:51:50.051 --> 00:51:55.051
it to some degree during the war and general began to feel that maybe Athens was

634
00:51:56.111 --> 00:52:01.111
becoming more frightening from the Persian point of view than Sparta was after

635
00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:05.680
all Sparta was out of the Navy business now and they were not likely to be able

636
00:52:05.681 --> 00:52:06.670
to get back into it.

637
00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:10.240
And if you don't have a navy you really can't threaten Persia very much.

638
00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:14.770
So at least until Alexander came along and figured out a way to do it.

639
00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.273
<v 12>So</v>

640
00:52:17.650 --> 00:52:22.650
all of that gives the Spartans who really want to get out of this war because it

641
00:52:22.961 --> 00:52:23.890
isn't going anywhere.

642
00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:29.550
The the the the hope that they can bring about a peace and so the Spartans try

643
00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:35.730
to make peace with the aid of Persia is a Spartan political figure by the name

644
00:52:37.541 --> 00:52:42.541
of and Tacitus who emerges on this scene and we shall see it his life the few

645
00:52:42.791 --> 00:52:43.780
times we hear about him.

646
00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:49.200
He's always engaged in attempting to contain spark his ambitions to certainly

647
00:52:52.810 --> 00:52:57.810
exclude the possibility of overseas commitments and I would argue I think most

648
00:52:57.821 --> 00:53:02.821
guys would agree even to it's not to be engaged outside of the Peloponnese is

649
00:53:02.951 --> 00:53:03.784
very far.

650
00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:09.310
<v 11>He seems to represent a traditionalist point of view which obviously comes to</v>

651
00:53:09.311 --> 00:53:14.311
the fore as this war which the Spartans have started really as part of a just

652
00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:18.580
Alliance's aggressive policy isn't working.

653
00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:21.910
The Spartans are having to constantly fight.

654
00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:27.300
They are suffering casualties their allies are becoming more and more restive

655
00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:28.790
and look what's happened.

656
00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:33.810
Suddenly Sparta which was absolutely in charge of everything is practically on

657
00:53:34.001 --> 00:53:34.660
the defensive.

658
00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:39.660
So for all these reasons is opposition to the bold policy and touts it as

659
00:53:39.761 --> 00:53:44.761
represents that he he gets the Spartan assembly or the Spartan Garcia and

660
00:53:44.981 --> 00:53:49.981
efforts to support a mission to the king of Persia in which he tries to

661
00:53:50.261 --> 00:53:52.990
negotiate a peace.
It doesn't work.

662
00:53:53.590 --> 00:53:58.590
<v 9>In large part because the enemies that is Athens and and Thebes particularly and</v>

663
00:54:02.591 --> 00:54:03.790
perhaps the others as well.

664
00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:05.620
<v 12>No I'm sorry.
Currents in Argos.</v>

665
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:10.960
Also I'll tell you why in a moment are not ready to do what is necessary from

666
00:54:10.961 --> 00:54:11.800
the Spartan point of view.

667
00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:15.910
What the Spartans really want is to break up this coalition.

668
00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:19.480
And all anti Spartan coalitions.

669
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:21.970
That's really the bottom line for Sparta.

670
00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:25.270
No sense making peace if you leave these people in tact.

671
00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:28.630
<v 9>What's to stop the whole thing from happening again in the future.</v>

672
00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:34.080
That's the bottom line and they are unable to persuade the Greeks to make the

673
00:54:34.541 --> 00:54:36.430
concessions that are necessary.

674
00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:41.790
So the war continues and nothing really changes except things get worse.

675
00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:51.290
<v 10>This time the antacid is again negotiates a peace and he really negotiates it</v>

676
00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:55.460
with the great king of Persia.

677
00:54:56.230 --> 00:55:01.230
The king of Persia has changed his mind about where the great threat comes from.

678
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:05.530
Threats of bullies in the three nineties in the latter part of the three

679
00:55:05.531 --> 00:55:10.531
nineties engages in a series of naval campaigns all around the GNC in which he

680
00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:18.360
covers one city after another that used to be under Athenian rule and once again

681
00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:21.370
puts it under Athenian rule.

682
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:24.280
He even once again starts collecting money from them.

683
00:55:25.090 --> 00:55:28.810
He did something also that the Athenians had done late in the Peloponnesian War.

684
00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:34.070
<v 12>He establishes a customs house in the hell a spot in the Bosphorus and every</v>

685
00:55:34.661 --> 00:55:39.661
ship that goes through pays a tax to the Athenians so there's a real feeling in

686
00:55:41.111 --> 00:55:45.160
Persia obviously that these things are coming back to rebuild their empire and

687
00:55:45.161 --> 00:55:48.370
we'd better stop them and the Spartans are safer.

688
00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:53.020
From our point of view having been chastened by events and so I think that's

689
00:55:53.021 --> 00:55:58.021
probably the single most important reason why the great king comes out and backs

690
00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:04.760
and as we shall see insists on a peace in Greece which meets Spartans needs and

691
00:56:07.331 --> 00:56:12.331
the needs are that all these international organizations should be broken up.

692
00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:19.560
Obviously the the league of four states that have conducted the war must stop.

693
00:56:21.610 --> 00:56:26.610
But on top of that the union between Argos and Corinth must be broken up.

694
00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:32.650
That's especially critical to the Spartans.
That's right next door.

695
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:37.520
August would be strengthened by its association with currents and if it was

696
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:41.170
allowed to continue it would be a problem in the future so now to be broken up

697
00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:46.860
seems of course was a great problem for the Spartans and they insisted that

698
00:56:49.210 --> 00:56:53.860
before peace to come the Boche the thieves had the thieves had to give up their

699
00:56:53.861 --> 00:56:55.490
control of the ocean.

700
00:56:55.960 --> 00:57:00.940
They had used the war as an opportunity to reconstruct the old Ocean League

701
00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:05.630
which left Thebes at the head and in control of the bulk of the ocean.

702
00:57:05.830 --> 00:57:10.830
That was to be broken up in order to reduce and power originally.

703
00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:16.160
The Spartans had wanted the Athenians to give up the things that they had

704
00:57:16.161 --> 00:57:18.800
acquired in the course of the war but they couldn't do that.

705
00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:24.230
Athens was still too strong in the one field that they couldn't be challenged in

706
00:57:24.231 --> 00:57:24.800
easily.

707
00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:29.750
Their control of the sea and so the compromise had to be made.

708
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:34.820
If a piece was to be made Athens would not join unless it was allowed to keep.

709
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:39.230
Let's not scare us Ambrose.
So that was permitted

710
00:57:40.810 --> 00:57:43.630
so the peace came and it is.

711
00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:49.260
The critical part Xenophon reports the exact language of a message that King

712
00:57:50.381 --> 00:57:52.810
artic services sent to the Greeks.

713
00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:57.220
That was in effect the instrument that made the peace.

714
00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:00.060
Here's what it said.
King Ark.

715
00:58:00.250 --> 00:58:05.250
Arctic circuses thinks it just that the cities in Asia and the islands of

716
00:58:05.801 --> 00:58:09.770
classroom Meany and Cypress shall belong to him.

717
00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:16.150
Further that all the other Greek cities small and great shall be autonomous.

718
00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:20.900
Listen to that word that's critical that this piece is associated with the

719
00:58:20.901 --> 00:58:25.700
principle of autonomy.
There shall be no breach of autonomy.

720
00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:28.130
Except.
Says the king.

721
00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:33.220
Let us Ambrose and scare us which shall belong to Athens as in the past.

722
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:40.870
If any refuse to accept this piece I shall make war on them along with those who

723
00:58:43.851 --> 00:58:45.110
are of the same purpose.

724
00:58:45.830 --> 00:58:50.550
Both by land and sea and with both ships and money.

725
00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:56.720
<v 9>Ancient writers and modern writers have disagreed as to what is the name of this</v>

726
00:58:56.721 --> 00:59:00.220
piece.
Some of them speak of the piece of an Tacitus.

727
00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:05.800
More of them I think speak and I think they are right in this decision as the

728
00:59:07.581 --> 00:59:09.060
King's piece.

729
00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:13.880
This is not the product of a negotiation and the king is very careful even

730
00:59:13.881 --> 00:59:14.780
though it really is.

731
00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:17.960
But he is very careful to make it clear that that's not the way he sees it.

732
00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:23.410
This is a command level by the King at the Greek say saying this is how you will

733
00:59:25.821 --> 00:59:30.420
be.
I say so.
And if you don't like it I will beat the hell out of you.

734
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:36.460
That's the message that comes but of course the reason he can say that with as

735
00:59:36.461 --> 00:59:41.461
much confidence as he does is that his partner in the peace is Sparta.

736
00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:47.700
This is a peace that will benefit Persia and benefit Sparta at the expense of

737
00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:49.360
everybody else.

738
00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:54.720
The Spartans take it as a license to run Greece in the way that they see fit.

739
00:59:56.380 --> 01:00:01.380
Notice nobody says that the Spartans have to break up the Peloponnesian league.

740
01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:06.670
That doesn't count as any kind of a violation of autonomy.

741
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:12.270
<v 12>And so that's the nature of the peace when among the results are that the</v>

742
01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:17.910
Asiatic Greeks are abandoned by the Greek people by the Greek states once and

743
01:00:19.511 --> 01:00:20.110
for all.

744
01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:25.110
And of course that means Sparta mainly until finally Alexander will impose his

745
01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:31.081
rule when he conquers the Persian Empire to be ocean league is dissolved all

746
01:00:31.181 --> 01:00:36.181
gross and currents are split and Athens loses all that has been gained except

747
01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:39.430
for those three islands that are mentioned

748
01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:46.520
Sparta regains and in a certain sense gets greater control of the mainland Greek

749
01:00:48.541 --> 01:00:49.374
situation.

750
01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:55.100
It is the heads your moan of Greece now as a kind of a partner of the great king

751
01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:59.910
and the Great King leaves Greece essentially to the Spartans without any

752
01:00:59.911 --> 01:01:00.744
interference.

753
01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:01.560
<v 11>How do you do that.</v>

754
01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:05.010
They do that in the same way they did it to win the Peloponnesian War.

755
01:01:05.610 --> 01:01:09.850
An enemy of the Spartans would say because they were me die Zeus.

756
01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:14.960
They had done the work of the Persians they had collaborated with the Persians

757
01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.380
against the Greeks.

758
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:20.850
That's not how the Spartans saw it of course they would have said something like

759
01:01:20.851 --> 01:01:24.800
I guess there's a crack in Plutarch somewhere.
It said We have not meet eyes.

760
01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:26.040
It's the Spartan.

761
01:01:26.110 --> 01:01:31.110
It's the Persians who have Spartan eyes but that's a very kind way of looking at

762
01:01:32.071 --> 01:01:34.830
it.
It is without question.

763
01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:39.390
If you look back on it we're talking about just about one hundred years after

764
01:01:39.391 --> 01:01:44.391
the Persian War and it's a reversal of the Persian Wars the Greeks won the

765
01:01:45.121 --> 01:01:49.620
Persian Wars and the proof of it was they chased the great king out of Europe

766
01:01:50.850 --> 01:01:55.850
eager to stay alive and completely unable to do anything about what the Greeks

767
01:01:55.921 --> 01:01:59.880
were to do with the coastal regions of the Persian Empire.

768
01:02:00.570 --> 01:02:05.570
<v 12>Now the king of Persia is telling the Greeks what they must do.</v>

769
01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:11.810
It was widely seen seen as a cause for great shame and by those people who were

770
01:02:14.131 --> 01:02:16.440
not friendly to Sparta.
A great.

771
01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:22.660
A great core cause of anger against the Spartans who were responsible for this

772
01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:25.050
condition of things.

773
01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:30.080
But the Spartans didn't care much because they were now in a position to

774
01:02:30.541 --> 01:02:35.460
exercise the power that the dominant force in Sparta who was just Elias and his

775
01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:38.680
supporters wanted to do so in three eighty five.

776
01:02:39.810 --> 01:02:44.810
<v 8>We see the Spartans attacking the city of Manzanita once again the story is very</v>

777
01:02:50.071 --> 01:02:55.071
much like this story of Ellis and forward to this time Manzanita had been again

778
01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:00.630
one of those states in the Peloponnese that had joined in a quadruple alliance

779
01:03:00.631 --> 01:03:02.080
against Sparta and twenty one.

780
01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:07.740
<v 0>The great battle that so much threatened Spartan existence and for a team had</v>

781
01:03:07.741 --> 01:03:10.630
been fought on the territory of Manta.

782
01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:15.150
It had a democratic history and democratic tendencies.

783
01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:19.050
So with no group no pretext really at all.

784
01:03:19.350 --> 01:03:24.350
The Spartans invaded their territory besiege the city managed finally to to

785
01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:31.940
defeat Manzanita by sending a diverting the waters of a river that ran through

786
01:03:33.421 --> 01:03:37.560
Manzanita to the point where it undermined the walls and they had to surrender

787
01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:43.190
Xenophon learns an important lesson about warfare in this event and he concludes

788
01:03:44.071 --> 01:03:48.630
his account of this by saying Well that shows you that you should not build your

789
01:03:48.631 --> 01:03:52.920
city around the river so any of you are planning.

790
01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:53.843
<v 13>Keep that in mind.</v>

791
01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:02.980
<v 9>Then soon afterwards the Spartans turn on another city in the Peloponnese as the</v>

792
01:04:04.791 --> 01:04:09.350
city of fliers which is not to this it's the southwest of Corinth.

793
01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.200
Not a very big city but not a small tiny one either.

794
01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:15.530
And what it turns out here is that the

795
01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:20.150
thing that the fly agents have done that the Spartans don't like is that they

796
01:04:20.151 --> 01:04:23.480
have been a democracy for part of the time and.

797
01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:29.930
King is just the latest basically removes the government after fighting a war

798
01:04:29.931 --> 01:04:32.390
and besieging the city was not an easy task.

799
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:37.630
It was expensive and time consuming but they finally do establish if they do

800
01:04:38.721 --> 01:04:43.721
gain a victory and it just always puts in a new government made up not just of

801
01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.250
oligarchs which of course they were.

802
01:04:46.610 --> 01:04:50.320
But they were the personal friends of adjusts the less.

803
01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:56.500
If you look at it historically it resembles the stuff that like lasagna was

804
01:04:57.261 --> 01:05:01.700
doing at the end of the Peloponnesian War and afterwards in placing these deck

805
01:05:01.701 --> 01:05:06.701
car keys of his friends in the cities so that they would not be only pro Spartan

806
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:12.140
but pro life Sander.
And here are just the latest did the same thing in fly us.

807
01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:14.690
And it's not the only place that he did.

808
01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:20.860
And then a Normandy followed enormity as the Spartan power was unchecked in this

809
01:05:23.391 --> 01:05:25.730
period of time.
Up in the north.

810
01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:31.450
The city of Linz us in the Chao civic Peninsula was gaining control of that

811
01:05:32.931 --> 01:05:37.931
peninsula basically establishing itself as the hedge hormonal power over cities

812
01:05:38.421 --> 01:05:43.421
in that region and 383 a couple of cities up in that region came to Sparta

813
01:05:45.290 --> 01:05:50.290
complaining of what the cleansings were doing and urging the Spartans to defend

814
01:05:53.661 --> 01:05:58.661
them and to undo these things using as the basis for their appeal.

815
01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:04.010
The Kings peace.
This was a violation of their autonomy.

816
01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:09.010
The Spartans were to be the upholders of Greek autonomy according to the king's

817
01:06:09.011 --> 01:06:09.844
peace.

818
01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:15.190
And so they ought to send a force up and the Spartans did so.

819
01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:21.530
And in the course of that war which lasted from three eighty two to three

820
01:06:21.531 --> 01:06:22.364
seventy nine.

821
01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:27.970
They defeated alliances dissolve the Confederacy and destroyed any again any

822
01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:34.220
notion of a league other than the Spartan league.

823
01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:39.790
But there was an event that was connected with that movement up towards the

824
01:06:41.001 --> 01:06:44.900
north east up to the Charles citizen which was the most famous.

825
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:49.940
I think there's a small competition for a couple of events but one of the most

826
01:06:49.941 --> 01:06:54.560
famous anyway in this period illustrating the arrogance and power of the

827
01:06:54.561 --> 01:06:59.561
Spartans had Germany a Spartan force was sent off ostensibly to reinforce their

828
01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:04.850
Spartan army up there in the Charles cities C.

829
01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:08.110
It was led by a general named Phebe das.

830
01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:14.240
As he was moving north on a route that would not have been the normal route to

831
01:07:14.241 --> 01:07:19.241
take a route that took him right past the city of thieves he camped out at night

832
01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:26.620
and on his way there was contacted by an important official in the government of

833
01:07:29.861 --> 01:07:32.210
thieves an oligarch a friend of Sparta.

834
01:07:33.770 --> 01:07:38.770
The next day the Spartan army seized the Acropolis of Thebes which is called

835
01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:41.333
Academy a

836
01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:47.460
they did so on the day a sacred day a holiday was being celebrated everybody was

837
01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:50.910
in the same shape.
People are on on a holiday.

838
01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:56.460
Nobody was ready to.
They took the city.

839
01:07:56.910 --> 01:08:01.910
The enemies of the dominant party that had invited the Spartans in were put to

840
01:08:03.091 --> 01:08:06.590
death if they could not flee successfully.

841
01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.910
The Spartans left.

842
01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:15.620
A garrison on the Kashmir and took control of the city and had their stooges run

843
01:08:18.031 --> 01:08:19.460
the city thereafter.

844
01:08:20.610 --> 01:08:24.600
Now this had not been determined by the Spartan assembly.

845
01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:29.900
This was not the consequence of a policy decision that the Spartan officials or

846
01:08:30.421 --> 01:08:31.710
people had made.

847
01:08:32.670 --> 01:08:36.400
When feebleness came back to Sparta he was put on trial.

848
01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:41.440
And there was great anger against him and there was great anger against him

849
01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:43.630
against part of course throughout the Greek world.

850
01:08:45.370 --> 01:08:47.560
<v 8>There was no real case for him.</v>

851
01:08:48.130 --> 01:08:52.300
<v 0>But surprisingly enough even though he was not a member of a just alliances</v>

852
01:08:52.301 --> 01:08:57.301
faction I just always got up at the trial and simply said You guys are all

853
01:08:58.451 --> 01:08:59.650
talking about the wrong thing.

854
01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:05.110
There's only one question that should be asked about the behavior of it as.

855
01:09:05.890 --> 01:09:10.890
Did what he did was what was what he did good or bad for Sparta

856
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.080
Well it was obviously good.

857
01:09:14.770 --> 01:09:16.300
<v 13>Why in the world you want to punish him.</v>

858
01:09:17.050 --> 01:09:20.620
<v 9>And he was not punished with any severity.</v>

859
01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:26.140
A mild fine or at least a fine was imposed.
We don't know if he ever paid it.

860
01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:31.740
In any case the critical thing was what would Sparta do about the action itself

861
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:35.800
the fact that it had in the garrison up there on the cat Mia.

862
01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:40.870
If they thought it had been the wrong thing to do if it had been the idea of

863
01:09:40.871 --> 01:09:43.810
feed it asked and what didn't represent Spartan policy they should have

864
01:09:43.811 --> 01:09:48.811
withdrawn the garrison the garrison stayed so that Spartan now this was

865
01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.300
something that rang all around the Greek world.

866
01:09:52.690 --> 01:09:57.690
This was the worst thing anybody could remember in peacetime with no allegation

867
01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:03.750
of cause they had simply seized another city an ancient city a great city and

868
01:10:05.890 --> 01:10:07.270
they refused to back off

869
01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:11.220
finally there's one other.

870
01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:20.780
Example of this same kind of behavior the government concedes was tyrannical

871
01:10:21.061 --> 01:10:23.100
imposed upon an unwilling people.

872
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:29.390
Some of the people who had fled it would did a reverse of what had happened in

873
01:10:29.881 --> 01:10:34.080
the time of the 30 tyrants in Athens they fled to Athens and of course many

874
01:10:34.081 --> 01:10:38.190
Athenians gave them support and protected them.

875
01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:43.700
And then in 379 a small number of these exiles launched a clever plot that

876
01:10:45.871 --> 01:10:48.270
allowed them to sneak in to

877
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:54.830
Thebes and to make their way to the cat Mia and to kill the oligarchic leaders

878
01:10:55.591 --> 01:11:00.591
of the city in the dark when nobody could really do anything about it and to

879
01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:05.490
drive away a number of the Spartans and to free the city

880
01:11:07.050 --> 01:11:12.050
Thebes became free it became democratic too because these people now belong to a

881
01:11:13.021 --> 01:11:17.280
Democratic faction and more and more if you're a Democrat or anti Spartan.

882
01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:22.490
<v 0>If you're an oligarch you're pro Spartan and so all of this is the beginning of</v>

883
01:11:23.131 --> 01:11:27.390
what we will get through next time which is the flowering of Theeb and power.

884
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:30.190
It's going to happen as they get stronger and stronger.

885
01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:31.710
But the event I wanted to.

886
01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:37.670
Mention as the twin of the CBS thing is that in three seventy nine a Spartan.

887
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:44.990
Ha most of one of the garrisons in the ocean by the name of Squadron ass took a

888
01:11:46.471 --> 01:11:51.471
force by night marched into Attica ostensibly.

889
01:11:52.230 --> 01:11:57.230
His plan was to reach the Paris and then that would allow them to take control

890
01:11:58.921 --> 01:12:02.400
of Athens because they could cut them off from their Port at the sea.

891
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.140
He didn't get it quite right.

892
01:12:04.710 --> 01:12:09.710
By the time morning broke and they were visible he was still miles and miles and

893
01:12:09.871 --> 01:12:14.670
miles away from the Paris and so all he could do was to do some harm to the

894
01:12:14.671 --> 01:12:17.250
Athenian territory and then to go home.

895
01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:22.140
But when he got home again he hadn't gotten any vote from the Spartan assembly

896
01:12:22.141 --> 01:12:24.720
or from the accuracy of the efforts to do anything.

897
01:12:25.290 --> 01:12:30.000
Another thing that he'd apparently done on his own so there was another trial.

898
01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:31.313
And

899
01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:36.810
this time the only thing he had going for him apparently.

900
01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:40.560
Well he still had a just delays his general approach.

901
01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:45.290
But he was the lover of the son of a justice Elias and so we just last who

902
01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:50.300
ostensibly was hostile to what had happened was made to speak in his defense and

903
01:12:52.621 --> 01:12:57.621
this time his argument was simply Sparta has too few men of quality to be able

904
01:13:00.661 --> 01:13:04.050
to execute any for whatever reason whatsoever.

905
01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:09.350
And so we shouldn't do anything to spidery ass so they didn't and that was yet

906
01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:15.380
another signal that it had fantastic consequences in Athens.

907
01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:21.410
They had been holding some Spartan ambassadors when the when this Rodrigues raid

908
01:13:22.261 --> 01:13:26.280
had taken place and they were holding them in effect as hostages.

909
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:29.970
But the Hartleys these Spartans said look we had nothing to do with it.

910
01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:34.350
This was strategy as did it on his own he'll certainly be condemned when he gets

911
01:13:34.351 --> 01:13:38.190
back to Sparta.
So this is it OK you can go home and then he wasn't.

912
01:13:39.150 --> 01:13:44.150
And so the Athenians now would determine that they would have to fight Sparta

913
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:49.790
and in the process they set about organizing an alliance general alliance meant

914
01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:57.390
against Sparta which they were able to do in considerable part because of all of

915
01:13:57.391 --> 01:14:02.391
the irritation that had been felt all around Greece by these terrible actions of

916
01:14:03.061 --> 01:14:03.894
the Spartans.

917
01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:09.260
<v 9>And as I think I'll tell you next time they put together what we call the second</v>

918
01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:15.920
Athenian confederation and they made an alliance with the newly liberated Thebes

919
01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:22.620
Thebes which is going to get stronger and stronger and stronger.

920
01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:28.040
And so we have now a threat once again to the Spartan hegemony which will be

921
01:14:28.501 --> 01:14:32.220
very serious but of a different kind from the one we had before.

922
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:33.450
I'll you that next time.
