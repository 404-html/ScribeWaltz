WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:01.980
Okay.

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.870
We were discussing the rise of the Polis and I was,

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.860
uh,

4
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.860
into the subject of the way the Greeks thought about the significance and the

5
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:19.350
function of the Polis,
which is really critical.

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.410
I believe in distinguishing between the Polis ASPEC a example of a city,

7
00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:29.730
state and other cities,
states in history.

8
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.040
It's the notion of what the function of that state is.

9
00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:39.030
I think that is most striking.
I,
um,

10
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.570
I was about to tell you last time about the poet Hesiod who lived in a little

11
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:49.530
town,
uh,
and be Osha to the north of Attica.

12
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.370
Uh,

13
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.370
he describes himself as a farmer and in the works and days he talks about the

14
00:00:57.721 --> 00:01:02.721
quarrel he had with his brother and how he was mistreated in his opinion.

15
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.720
When his brother bribed the,
uh,
the barons,

16
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:11.460
the Basti lace in his area of,
uh,
and cheated him of his birthright.

17
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.080
And,
uh,

18
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.460
he quotes a kind of a fable.

19
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:20.270
He says he is a fool.
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:23.760
It tells us this fable of the Hawk and the Nightingale,

21
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.130
which illustrates really the doctrine of might over right.

22
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.730
And the Hawk says he is a fool who tries to match his strength with the stronger

23
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.960
he will lose the battle and with the shame will be heard also.

24
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.590
So don't try to fight against stronger people is what he says.

25
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.660
Uh,
he,
she,
it says this is the wrong doctrine.

26
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.940
It is better.
He says,

27
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:58.941
to go by the path leading to justice for when justice is outraged.

28
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.681
And by the way,

29
00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:06.681
justice here is personified in the form of the goddess called decade.

30
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.070
She follows perforce weeping to the Polis and the gatherings of people.

31
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.490
She puts a dark mist upon her and brings a curse upon all those who drive her

32
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:24.180
out,
who deal in her and twist her in dealing.

33
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.740
And he speaks about the word Polis more than once.

34
00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:30.840
In the same general context,

35
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.230
he draws a contrast between the men who give just decisions to strangers and to

36
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:40.050
natives and who do not depart from what is just,

37
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.070
and those who practice violence and cruel deeds.

38
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.770
In the case of the former,

39
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.460
the polis flourishes and its people prosper.

40
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.800
Peace reigns over their land and Zeus keeps them free of wars.

41
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.160
They don't suffer famines or disasters.

42
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.970
Their flocks have thick wool.
Their wives bear them children.

43
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.570
So fruitful is their land that they are spared the evil necessity of traveling

44
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:12.390
on ships.
And there you have,
uh,

45
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.840
an interesting point about the Greeks he's using is not alone in saying for

46
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:17.470
God's sake,

47
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.760
try not to take a voyage at sea because your chances of coming back or really

48
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:25.300
bad,
which was the reality to a degree,

49
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.750
it's a very strange thing because the Greeks turned out to be an enormously

50
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:33.100
active seafaring people with tremendous fear of the sea.

51
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.230
I think that those things are connected.

52
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.900
But what about those who don't follow the path of righteousness,
of justice,

53
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:45.610
of decay?
Zeus orders severe punishments for them.

54
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.330
Often even a whole Polis is paid punishment for one bad man.

55
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.880
His people are troubled by disasters,
plagues,
famines.

56
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.710
The men die.
The women are barren.
At another time,

57
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.890
Zeus destroys the y camped army of people or wrecks their city with its walls or

58
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:13.510
their ships on the open water.
Well,

59
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.540
one thing that emerges from these lines and Hesiod is that poke,

60
00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:21.400
the policy's already there.

61
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.460
There was no way to talk about what he's talking about in the kinds of

62
00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:30.040
settlements that existed before the invention of the Polis.

63
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.880
And that I think is worth mentioning if our date for him,

64
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:36.100
which is very problematical,

65
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:40.120
but if it's right roughly then by certainly by 700 BC,

66
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.220
there are people who know what police are,
police exist.

67
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.860
But beyond that there is the fact that for the Greeks that early and always by

68
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:56.560
the way it remains.
So the notion of,

69
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.963
uh,

70
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.500
justice is directly connected with the Poles.

71
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.870
The only place where justice exists or can exist is in a polis.

72
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.060
The only way you can lead a good life is if you live in a polis.

73
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.400
And when you do live in a Polis,

74
00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:19.330
of course you will have to behave justly because,

75
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:21.040
and this is tremendously important.

76
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.720
Your behavior doesn't affect just you and your family.

77
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.770
It involves the entire community.
Remember,

78
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.820
even one bad man can ruin a pose.

79
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.270
That is a very strong statement about the priority of community.

80
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.270
And it's very different from the values that we knew we saw in the Iliad and the

81
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:49.510
Odyssey.
You cannot imagine.

82
00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:54.511
It seems to me in the world that he see a describes Achilles or anybody else

83
00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:55.361
saying,

84
00:05:55.361 --> 00:06:00.361
well you insulted me and I'm not going to fight anymore for my poles.

85
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.650
That would have been inconceivable in this world now so we're on at this given

86
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:10.610
this information we are on to the problem.

87
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.510
That will be a problem for the Greek Polis for the rest of it's history and it's

88
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:22.001
really a problem to this very day for all people who live in some sort of a

89
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:23.840
civilized community,

90
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.250
how to reconcile the interests and desires and wellbeing of the individual and

91
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:37.190
his immediate family.
With those of the community at large,

92
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.880
they may seem and probably might even be said to be different and antagonistic

93
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.550
at some point and when they are,

94
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.370
what should you do for the Greeks?

95
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.640
The answer was pretty clear hereafter one ought to be interested and to take

96
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:03.790
action in behalf of the Polis and we'll be seeing this kind of argument and

97
00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:09.260
people presenting positions about it going on into the future,

98
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.520
but to positions nobody is going to be very comfortable if comfortable at all.

99
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:18.260
It would be a very odd ball position to take for the rest of Greek history.
No,

100
00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:21.050
the right thing to do is to take care of yourself and the hell with the polls.

101
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.090
That's not what you're going to hear.

102
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.670
What you're going to hear is to the contrary.

103
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.790
A little bit later when we get to talking about Sparta,

104
00:07:28.791 --> 00:07:33.210
you'll see a beautiful example of that in the form of a,

105
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:38.230
the poems of Tortillas who was a poet in Sparta whose poetry became so central

106
00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:44.711
to their way of thinking and living that they were used as marching songs for

107
00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:49.220
the Spartan Army as they walked and they make the same point.

108
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:50.330
But I'll come back to that.

109
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.770
Now here's another document that you want to be aware of that gives you some

110
00:07:56.781 --> 00:08:01.781
idea of what the Greeks fairly early thought the Polis was for and about.

111
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:06.440
And what's the relationship between individual and Polis was in this case I'm

112
00:08:06.441 --> 00:08:08.660
talking about,
uh,

113
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:12.560
Hurghada Titus who very early in his history,

114
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:18.510
speaks about a tell us the story really of,
um,

115
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.520
his visit to Lydia to the land of the great tyrant creases who is also the

116
00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:30.890
richest man in the world.

117
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.330
It's not clear that this event ever really took place,

118
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.320
but it's really not very important because what [inaudible] is doing is telling

119
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.300
how he,

120
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:46.450
I think and how the Greek in general viewed the questions at issue.

121
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.300
So on goes to visit creases.

122
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.600
Creases asks so long to tell him who is the happiest,

123
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.570
the most fortunate.

124
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:02.310
Both of those things contained in this and the words he uses that he had ever

125
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:05.250
seen so on was now a man of full years.

126
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:10.550
He was a man of greatly respect that he turns out to be one of the seven sages

127
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.930
that the ancient Greeks selected for the wisest men,
whoever war.

128
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.370
So if,
uh,
it would be interesting to know what he thought about that.

129
00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:26.340
Um,
of course,
creases had shown his great wealth already to,

130
00:09:26.341 --> 00:09:30.690
uh,
so long.
And in my view,
he put the question this way.

131
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.910
So long as he looked around at his fabulous wealth and great,

132
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:40.050
good fortune,
he said,
who,
who do you think is the happiest,

133
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.240
most fortunate man you ever knew him?

134
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:47.010
And you know what the answer was that he expected.
So on answered,

135
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.650
tell us of Athens.

136
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:55.200
I bet you never heard of telus of Athens.
Neither had creases.

137
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:59.730
Neither had anybody else outside of Athens.

138
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:04.170
Creases was astonished.
And he asks Solon why?

139
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.410
Why did he select telus?
And here's what her,

140
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:12.490
this says first because his city was flourishing.

141
00:10:13.501 --> 00:10:17.520
That is Polis.
That's the word in Greek,
was flourishing in his time.

142
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.000
And he himself had sons,

143
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.000
both beautiful and good.

144
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:29.120
The words in Greek are Carlos Agathos for the singular cowboy cowgirl toy.

145
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:34.980
And it's a kind of a formula.
It means a gentlemen.

146
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.890
It means the best kind of person.

147
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:43.220
If a person is a coloscopy I thoughts it means he is good to look at.

148
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:48.420
And his soul is excellent.
All that you could expect of a person.

149
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.310
So he had a,
uh,
um,
two.

150
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.680
He had sons,
beautiful and good,

151
00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.650
and he lived to see children born to each of them.

152
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:04.490
And these children all grew up and further because after a life spent in what

153
00:11:05.461 --> 00:11:07.650
our people look upon as comfort,

154
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:13.460
his end was surpassingly glorious and a battle between the Athenians and their

155
00:11:15.061 --> 00:11:18.690
neighbors near elusive.
He came to the assistance of his countrymen,

156
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:24.150
routed the foe,
and died upon the field.
Most gallantly,

157
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:28.110
the Athenians gave him a public funeral on the spot.

158
00:11:28.111 --> 00:11:31.770
Gray fell and paid him the highest honors.

159
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.680
So to summarize,
the happiest,

160
00:11:34.681 --> 00:11:39.681
the most fortunate man that so on ever knew was a dead Athenian that nobody ever

161
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:46.590
heard of.
Why?
What does this say,
right?

162
00:11:46.591 --> 00:11:51.591
We see in this passage something that reveals so much about what the Greek

163
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.040
values were,

164
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:59.820
and you'll see how closely they were tied up with the Polis and the primacy of

165
00:12:00.461 --> 00:12:04.630
the Polis in their lives.
Well,
well,
why?
Why are things good?
Well,
his city,

166
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:08.590
his Polis was doing well.
A man who was living in a Polish not doing well.

167
00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:12.880
How can he be happy?
There's just no way.
Secondly,

168
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:14.110
sons.

169
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:19.590
Now this has to do with the Greek idea about immortality and mortality since the

170
00:12:21.761 --> 00:12:24.730
Greeks really didn't believe in personal immortality.

171
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:29.470
How do you find what everybody wants in mortality?

172
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:35.160
One way is through your family and it's sons who carry forward the family name,

173
00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:36.964
so to speak.

174
00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.380
So if you have sons and they are healthy and they do well and they have
children,

175
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:46.840
that means your name will be carried into the future,
your memory will persist.

176
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.680
And that is one form of immortality.

177
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.460
And then of course the greatest form of immortality.

178
00:12:54.461 --> 00:12:59.461
And think of it when you compare it with what was the form of immortality

179
00:12:59.561 --> 00:13:02.410
available to Achilles and his fellow heroes.

180
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:08.070
You fought for your Polis and when you died fighting no glue for your Polis,

181
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:17.530
you will be.
And we're then you,
you were uh,

182
00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.280
honored extraordinarily by that Polis.

183
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:26.610
And what everybody knew then was that you are memory with last thereafter,

184
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.170
so long as your polis lasted.

185
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.810
And the proof of it is that Herata it is,

186
00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:36.220
knows that story and is telling it as will other storytellers.

187
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.970
And in fact it worked.
Here we are talking about,

188
00:13:39.971 --> 00:13:44.971
tell us all these many years later thanks to her Auditas but the point is that

189
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:51.660
this form of immortality is available to tell us because of his place in the

190
00:13:54.191 --> 00:13:55.024
polls,

191
00:13:55.300 --> 00:14:00.100
because of the deeds he does for the Polis.

192
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.850
And that is the greatest possible pay off.

193
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.150
And there you see something that is,
you know,

194
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:11.350
I've been making the case that a polos is a different thing from any other city

195
00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:12.010
state.

196
00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:17.010
I'm not aware that any other culture that had city states had ideas of this con

197
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:20.560
that,
uh,
uh,
help make,

198
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:24.940
explain why one was associated with it and cared about it.

199
00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:26.470
And,
um,

200
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:31.470
the final document I want to use to make the point here comes from precisely the

201
00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:36.580
poems of solar as we shall see later.

202
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:41.730
So long will be a very important political figure in Athens and at a critical

203
00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:43.330
moment in Athenian history.

204
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:47.920
And the Athenians will give him the honor and the responsibility of being the

205
00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:53.090
sole public official and to draw up a new constitution,

206
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.980
the laws for Athens enormously important job.

207
00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.390
Um,

208
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:04.870
and in the course of doing that and in the course of defending himself against

209
00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:07.820
the tax after he had done it,

210
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:13.420
he wrote but really amount to political pamphlets to defend his actions and to

211
00:15:14.631 --> 00:15:19.430
set forth the ideas that lay under his,
um,

212
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:23.380
uh,
the actual laws that he had put forward.
And,
um,

213
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.750
but as you may know in,

214
00:15:26.751 --> 00:15:30.410
in writing the earliest kinds of writing among the Greeks anyway,

215
00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:33.080
I think this is not a typical come,

216
00:15:33.081 --> 00:15:36.170
not in the form of prose but in the form of poetry.

217
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:41.750
And that's because people are used to,
uh,
before they use writing,

218
00:15:41.751 --> 00:15:44.600
they are used to remembering things through verse.

219
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.060
I don't know if this is true of you,

220
00:15:47.061 --> 00:15:49.610
but it certainly is true of people in my generation,

221
00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:54.950
the things that they taught us in school when they required us to remember

222
00:15:54.951 --> 00:15:58.280
poetry,
no matter how we try,
we can't forget it.

223
00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.690
And the stuff that we had,
remember that was in prose.
No matter how we try,

224
00:16:02.691 --> 00:16:06.020
we can't remember it.
It's the rhythm.
Uh,

225
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.120
I bet even all of you can,

226
00:16:08.121 --> 00:16:12.680
can remember songs that you have known all your life.
But not other things.

227
00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:17.370
So it's a great mnemonic device,
but in any case,
that's why,
uh,

228
00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:22.070
so lungs,
pamphlets are written in poetry and,
uh,

229
00:16:22.071 --> 00:16:25.280
apparently in a really good poetry.

230
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:30.730
And so we have his very words here is a of a fragment from one of his poems.

231
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:38.590
So the public ruin invades the house of each citizen and the courtyard doors no

232
00:16:41.871 --> 00:16:44.480
longer have strength to keep it away,

233
00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.230
but it overlaps the lofty wall.

234
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.520
And though a man runs in and tries to hide it as chamber or closet,

235
00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.290
it ferrets him out.

236
00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:58.070
So my spirit dictates to me,

237
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.880
I must tell the Athenians how many evils a city suffers from bad government.

238
00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:10.310
The Greek word for that is dish.
No,
Mia.
Uh,

239
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:12.900
and how good government a,
you know,

240
00:17:12.901 --> 00:17:16.340
mia displays all neatness and order,

241
00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:21.470
and many times she must put shackles on the breakers of laws.

242
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.570
I get this a,
you know,
mia levels,

243
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.720
rough places stops glut and greed takes the force from violence.

244
00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:39.380
She drives up the growing flowers of despair.
As they grow,

245
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.890
she straightens out crooked judgments.

246
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:47.690
Remember those crooked judgments that he had complained about?
Well,

247
00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.110
the Polis straightens out crooked judgments,

248
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:57.140
gives a given gentles the swollen ambitions and puts an end to act of divisional

249
00:17:58.981 --> 00:18:03.200
strife.
She stills the gall of wary,

250
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.120
some hate and under her influence.

251
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:11.570
All life among mankind is harmonious and does well.

252
00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:17.190
Wonderful.
Where do all these good things come from?
From God?

253
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.120
No,

254
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.720
they come from the Polis when its laws are good and therefore when the

255
00:18:25.141 --> 00:18:29.400
government that it provides is uh,
you know,

256
00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:31.350
mia rather than the opposite.

257
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.770
He is making a claim here,
which is a very strong,
powerful one,

258
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.790
but which was characteristic of the Greeks.
And I want you to take note of it.

259
00:18:41.791 --> 00:18:46.791
Here he is giving them the law and the Polis that gives law.

260
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:53.360
It's not merely a negative thing the way I think modern ideas about law as for

261
00:18:54.391 --> 00:18:59.130
instance,
represented in the American constitution,
uh,
are,

262
00:18:59.131 --> 00:19:04.020
which is to say it's function is to prevent wrongdoing,

263
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.390
to punish wrongdoing.

264
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:10.460
It doesn't really,
well,
let me,

265
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.830
let me just say what the pull is claims to do here in Houma.

266
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:18.170
It claims actually to shape the character of mankind.

267
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:24.420
The Polis makes a good polis with following good laws,

268
00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:27.030
makes its citizens better.

269
00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:32.520
It not only defeats wrong,
but it creates right?

270
00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:36.510
And it creates citizens who behave rightly.

271
00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:42.770
This is tremendously important because every Greek state that we know about made

272
00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:48.660
the claim that that's what it did,
no matter what its constitution was,

273
00:19:48.661 --> 00:19:50.520
no matter how these different from one another,

274
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.880
the idea was that the state has to make good men and that for a city to be good,

275
00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:59.190
the men must be good.
Um,

276
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.950
this is very different as if you think about the,

277
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.550
the American idea as an example of the modern way of thinking about these
things.

278
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.100
And the notion is a,
we,
we can't do anything.

279
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.920
The laws that can't do anything about making people better or worse,

280
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:15.570
it takes them as they are and then it deals with them accordingly.

281
00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:20.850
But for the ancient Greeks,
that was not enough.
You could not,
uh,

282
00:20:20.851 --> 00:20:24.200
an excuse me.
If you even think about the founding fathers,
Madison,
uh,

283
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.730
federalist 10,
uh,
based upon the principle that you,

284
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:33.920
you can expect that men will do wrong things and that a good constitution has,

285
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:36.840
uh,

286
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.840
the role of balancing the wrongs off against each other so as to produce the

287
00:20:42.991 --> 00:20:46.650
closest approximation possible to justice.

288
00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:51.890
You can only do that by balancing competitive desires that can be thought of as

289
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.240
evil faction was what they were talking about.

290
00:20:55.241 --> 00:20:57.100
And everybody thought faction was bad,

291
00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:01.000
but it was inevitable you couldn't get rid of factioned by saying to men,

292
00:21:01.001 --> 00:21:02.740
it's not good to be factious.

293
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:05.740
You should think of the whole community at all times.

294
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.500
That's not what the American constitution is about.

295
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.410
But it was what the Greek constitutions were about.

296
00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.610
A Polis ought to make men like that.
And in fact,

297
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:19.420
there's a great revolution in the political theory presented by the American

298
00:21:19.421 --> 00:21:23.080
constitution in that it's not the first thing to do it,

299
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:27.550
but it was the first one that was really applied in turning away,

300
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:32.580
rejecting the possibility that a constitution could make men better.

301
00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:36.460
It accepted the premise that men were what they were.

302
00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:41.560
And that the state had to control that by various devices.

303
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:46.990
So it's very important to see how different from that the Greek idea was and

304
00:21:46.991 --> 00:21:51.991
what an enormous responsibility the polis was supposed to have.

305
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:57.300
And of course with that there had to be an enormous amount of support for the

306
00:21:58.631 --> 00:22:01.570
state by the citizens.

307
00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:05.470
That's another thing I want to emphasize before I leave this subject.

308
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:10.600
The word citizen,
we should not take that for granted.
By the way,

309
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:13.290
in Greek,
the word citizen is pull,

310
00:22:13.291 --> 00:22:18.010
leap tastes derives from Polis.
He somebody who lives in a Polis,

311
00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:21.340
he's he's citizen.
Well,

312
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.060
there never was a citizen in the world before the Polis.

313
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.150
There were only subjects,

314
00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:33.900
people who are subject either to a god or to the king or to representative that

315
00:22:34.211 --> 00:22:37.340
God or to achieve tin or however.

316
00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.570
But somebody in a sense owns them all.

317
00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:42.820
But nobody owns a citizen.

318
00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:48.540
And this is something brand new in the world and we shall see how it crops up in

319
00:22:48.731 --> 00:22:52.060
different forms and how it shapes the course of Greek history.

320
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.130
Well,

321
00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:58.600
this whole business presents the problem I mentioned a moment ago.

322
00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:03.100
All of us have this natural selfishness.
When we are born.

323
00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:08.070
We all seek our own interests and soon we join up with their family.

324
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.990
We want the families interest up to a point.
Uh,

325
00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:15.880
and how is this fit together with the needs of the community at large?

326
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.160
A problem the Greeks always wrestled with,

327
00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:20.590
but when you get down to the fifth century,

328
00:23:20.591 --> 00:23:22.930
and indeed the latter part of the fifth century,

329
00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:28.060
there is a marvelous document that you will be reading a into cities is the

330
00:23:28.061 --> 00:23:33.061
famous funeral oration of Pericles is delivered in the winter of four 31 30 BC

331
00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:37.360
where one of the,
in my judgement,

332
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:41.350
one of the great things about [inaudible] was that he had given a great deal of

333
00:23:41.351 --> 00:23:46.351
thought to this problem and presented the best he could think of would for

334
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.490
solving that problem,

335
00:23:49.491 --> 00:23:54.491
which was to claim that the individuals highest needs and greatest personal and

336
00:23:56.961 --> 00:24:01.961
family goals could be met only through the Polis that his wellbeing was tied up

337
00:24:05.961 --> 00:24:10.910
in extra capably with the wellbeing of the pause.
Now you know,

338
00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.080
you don't have to buy that.

339
00:24:12.081 --> 00:24:16.460
And individuals undoubtedly found a strain too much from time to time.

340
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:21.230
But what's interesting is rather the ideal,
the claim,
the theory,

341
00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:26.680
you cannot truly achieve what you want and need as a human being without being

342
00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:33.220
an active and loyal citizens of this great community which you need to achieve

343
00:24:35.271 --> 00:24:36.800
what you want in life.

344
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:43.300
It is a claim already and as you've seen in Aristotle towards the end of the

345
00:24:44.121 --> 00:24:49.040
history of the Free Polis,
it is something necessary for mankind.

346
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:54.670
It is the center of his life and it explains the Greeks devotion to the

347
00:24:55.791 --> 00:24:56.690
independence,

348
00:24:56.691 --> 00:25:01.691
to the autonomy of the pose and their desire to beautify it and make it as great

349
00:25:04.611 --> 00:25:06.080
as it could possibly be.

350
00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:10.880
All of that sounds very nice and it certainly had very nice aspects to it,

351
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:14.450
but there was of course a downside to it as well,

352
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:18.560
which is every Polis wants it to be great and it being Greeks,

353
00:25:18.561 --> 00:25:23.561
they wanted it to be greater than the neighbors and sometimes that involves

354
00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:29.390
conflict and it often among the Greeks did involve war.

355
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:30.381
Now the Greeks,

356
00:25:30.381 --> 00:25:35.000
we're not unique in history and constantly being had war.

357
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:39.170
That is if you just examine the history of the human race.

358
00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.710
So soon as they were sufficiently organized to wage war,

359
00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.510
they began doing it all the time.

360
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:50.170
But it is true that the life of the Greek world was much more filled with war

361
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:56.450
throughout the history of the Poles.
Then other civilizations,

362
00:25:56.451 --> 00:26:01.451
because other civilizations after a time had one great power that was able to

363
00:26:04.011 --> 00:26:06.020
dominate the entire region.

364
00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.820
Egypt being the best example so that no longer was war possible.

365
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:16.850
But the flip side of that is there was also another thing that was impossible

366
00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:22.210
freedom and in Greece you have a lot of war and you have a lot of freedom and

367
00:26:23.661 --> 00:26:28.400
all of that is tied up I think very much with the development of this very

368
00:26:28.401 --> 00:26:31.130
special thing called the pulse.

369
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:36.790
Now let's take a look at other aspects of the Polis,

370
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.720
not ideas,
but rather how it functioned,
how it,

371
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:46.930
how it's functioned and how that helped to shape the characteristics that it

372
00:26:47.971 --> 00:26:51.270
showed in its full blown period.

373
00:26:51.271 --> 00:26:53.670
That is to say the classical period.

374
00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.690
I want to talk about
it.

375
00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:02.070
We're really sort of three things that come together.

376
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:06.760
One of them is how the Greeks in the,

377
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:11.580
in the late dark ages and on into the period in which the polos emerges,

378
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.170
made their living.

379
00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:18.750
And the second has to do with how they fought.

380
00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:24.300
And um,
uh,
what's my thing was my third,

381
00:27:24.301 --> 00:27:27.550
there is a third one.
Oh yes.
And the third is that knocked.

382
00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:32.560
These are not necessarily in the same in any particular order and also how they

383
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:36.510
were governed or rather how they govern themselves.

384
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.440
All of these three,
three things,
uh,

385
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:45.470
on my judgment are necessary to understand how the Polis came into being,

386
00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:50.110
how it came to be,
what it was and how it came to,
uh,

387
00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:55.170
fulfill and believe in these ideas that I have just been telling you about.

388
00:27:55.950 --> 00:28:00.950
And I should say at once that this is now a very controversial subject.

389
00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:05.670
Uh,
let me just back up a second.
In a way,
we're a,

390
00:28:05.671 --> 00:28:06.780
along the way,

391
00:28:06.781 --> 00:28:10.770
I'm attempting to also to answer the question that people always ask me when

392
00:28:10.771 --> 00:28:14.010
they understand that I'm a historian about grease and if they have any interest

393
00:28:14.011 --> 00:28:16.320
in this subject.
And he said,
yeah,
yeah,
the Greeks were terrific.

394
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:21.030
They achieved wonderful things.
Ebay were miracle,
golden age and all that.

395
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.990
But tell me how did that happen?
Why did they do that?

396
00:28:24.991 --> 00:28:26.790
But why them and not somebody else?

397
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:32.570
And until I came upon a brilliant solution that an another scholar presents to

398
00:28:33.451 --> 00:28:37.070
us,
all I could do was tell jokes.
Uh,

399
00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.920
I remember way before you guys were born,

400
00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:46.400
there was a TV show run by Sid Caesar and one of the characters that repeatedly

401
00:28:48.511 --> 00:28:53.511
showed up on this thing was kind of a comic German Austrian professor of

402
00:28:54.901 --> 00:28:56.580
seemingly seemingly everything.

403
00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:02.670
And then the call Rhino would interview him,
uh,
to,

404
00:29:02.671 --> 00:29:06.540
uh,
on the topic that was allegedly the topic of the day.

405
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:10.590
And on the one I remember best was he was a great aeronautical expert.

406
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:14.790
And here he was landing briefly.
He was being interviewed by Carl Reiner,

407
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.600
ask him questions and in his comic German accent,
uh,

408
00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:24.280
giving silly answers,
but finally,
um,
kindness as well.
Thank you.
Preventative.

409
00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.360
That's all very wonderful.
But you know,
our audience would really like,

410
00:29:27.361 --> 00:29:28.530
it seems like a simple question,

411
00:29:28.531 --> 00:29:31.440
but it's awfully hard to understand how can a great big,

412
00:29:31.441 --> 00:29:36.441
enormous heavy thing like this airplane get off the ground and he's an artist of

413
00:29:36.691 --> 00:29:40.110
that I simpler question.
It's not difficult to answer.
I mean,
you know,

414
00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:41.470
the beings go the Ale,

415
00:29:41.471 --> 00:29:45.880
Yvonne's and then the border Aandra engine and it's a miracle how it gets up

416
00:29:45.881 --> 00:29:46.714
there.

417
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:52.200
And that is the way I used to explain the Greeks because I had no better idea.

418
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.840
I could bumble around about geography and this and that,
but nothing.

419
00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:00.790
Then there came a great voice from the West.

420
00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:06.400
Victor Davis Hanson,
who was a professor at

421
00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.230
Fresno State,
California,
um,

422
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:17.500
sought about this and he brought to it in addition to extraordinary intelligence

423
00:30:17.501 --> 00:30:22.501
and a remarkably good knowledge of Greek and the Greeks,

424
00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:26.470
something,
a magical additional elements.

425
00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:31.860
And that was the fact that he was a farmer and he was,

426
00:30:32.351 --> 00:30:37.351
I think in the fifth generation that had farmed the same piece of farmland in

427
00:30:37.751 --> 00:30:41.160
California,
in the Central Valley of California,
uh,

428
00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:45.400
ever since the 19th century.
And what that climate by the way,

429
00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:50.580
and that whole scene is very similar to the Mediterranean kind of a climate that

430
00:30:51.881 --> 00:30:55.810
the,
uh,
Greek,
uh,
farmers we're engaged in.

431
00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:00.370
And so that it had potentially Hanson thought and I think he was right,

432
00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:05.650
a proper analogous possibilities.
And,

433
00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.040
uh,

434
00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:11.040
he came to the conclusion that much could be learned about the development of

435
00:31:14.021 --> 00:31:19.021
the Polis if one looked at the business of how one farms and these kinds of

436
00:31:20.321 --> 00:31:21.130
environments.

437
00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:26.020
And I think that turns out to be a great key to understanding what's happening.

438
00:31:26.021 --> 00:31:29.800
And it's everything you hear from me on this subject,
I learned from Hanson.

439
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:32.620
It is needless to say,
being a bright,

440
00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:37.060
brilliant idea that one guy thought of it has been assaulted on all sides and

441
00:31:37.061 --> 00:31:41.350
there is plenty of controversy about it.
Uh,

442
00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:44.560
you start with the dark ages and there was general agreement.

443
00:31:44.561 --> 00:31:49.561
I think that the population of Greece had become much smaller than it had been

444
00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.590
in the Mycenaean period.

445
00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:57.580
And that from the standpoint of the population,

446
00:31:57.581 --> 00:32:01.210
it could sustain.
It was underpopulated.

447
00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:07.440
And if you start with a look at what was the way in which the land was worked

448
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:12.880
for the purposes of feeding the population,

449
00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:18.840
it would be okay to take a look at the Homeric poems as some kind of evidence to

450
00:32:20.471 --> 00:32:23.950
help us out.
And Hanson focused on this,

451
00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:28.990
what was really obviously the unit that mattered in the,
in the world of homer,

452
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:32.470
the call it the family or,

453
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:36.510
but the Greek word is oil costs.
Oh,
I k o s.

454
00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:39.130
And it really means it means household,

455
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:44.000
but it comes to mean the land that the family works,

456
00:32:44.001 --> 00:32:47.090
the family itself.
And what does it look like?
Well,

457
00:32:47.091 --> 00:32:51.330
in the Odyssey there is a very fine example of the,
uh,

458
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:53.580
of such a place in the form of the,

459
00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:58.710
the oil costs of king layer tease the father of Odysseus who somehow was still

460
00:32:58.821 --> 00:33:02.870
alive when Odysseus is king,
but he is in retirement.
And there he is.

461
00:33:02.871 --> 00:33:05.720
We see him nobleman that he is former king,

462
00:33:05.721 --> 00:33:10.721
that he is working the soil and how he does this is very illuminating what you

463
00:33:12.741 --> 00:33:13.970
have.
Uh,
he,

464
00:33:13.971 --> 00:33:18.971
because he is clearly according to Hanson involved in the period after the

465
00:33:19.221 --> 00:33:22.070
transition away from an earlier style,

466
00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:27.550
but the earliest style pictures rather large estates by Greek standards with

467
00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:34.630
rating warrior groups going out to make a what seal,

468
00:33:35.901 --> 00:33:40.790
what they can.
They are engaged in raising livestock,

469
00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:45.860
which in in Greece is more likely to be sheep and goats,
then cattle.

470
00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:49.510
Uh,
but also breeding horses,
which are the,

471
00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:55.210
the thing that is very important for the aristocracy for carrying on warfare.

472
00:33:55.910 --> 00:34:00.380
That's lil flip back a step beyond that to Mycenaean civilization for the

473
00:34:00.381 --> 00:34:03.860
purpose of noting the great contrast,
a great change.

474
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:08.540
Remember liked in the ancient near east and kingdoms.

475
00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:13.660
Collectivized agriculture control from the center.

476
00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:20.090
The individuals who carry out the farming or the grazing,
they are don't,

477
00:34:20.091 --> 00:34:23.330
they are not permitted individual initiative.
They are control.

478
00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:29.020
This civilization like these other ancient Mediterranean kingdoms were rather

479
00:34:29.211 --> 00:34:30.044
advanced.

480
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:34.760
They knew how to cultivate the grape to make excellent wine.

481
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:40.240
They knew how to cultivate a olives to be able to make superboy olive oil and

482
00:34:41.991 --> 00:34:44.600
how to process them to produce the result.

483
00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:47.180
They were engaged in our board culture.

484
00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:51.560
They had fruit trees that produced very well.

485
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:56.720
It was a civilization that was rather advanced in terms of its agricultural

486
00:34:56.721 --> 00:34:57.554
skill.

487
00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:03.070
They knew the techniques for grafting and improving and domesticating species of

488
00:35:04.461 --> 00:35:07.070
grapes and all of us particularly,
you know,

489
00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:10.790
you can't go out there and just plant these things and what comes out is

490
00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:11.750
inedible,

491
00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:16.940
a unusable until you finally inter,
uh,

492
00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:19.400
what's the word I want you have to generate

493
00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:26.370
when you get,
when you mix two agricultural thing,
Greg,

494
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:27.740
you have to have the grant,
but what do you get?

495
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:33.650
Hybrids and in order to improve the category of what you're doing,
well,

496
00:35:33.651 --> 00:35:34.670
they could do all that.

497
00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:40.210
And that's the knowledge that was a in the palace that allow the kings in his

498
00:35:40.651 --> 00:35:43.800
people to send out messages,

499
00:35:43.801 --> 00:35:46.140
orders to everybody to do what they did.

500
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:49.440
Now when the palace civilization collapses,

501
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.450
the whole system collapses.

502
00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:57.180
There is that explains in large part why there was such a decline in population.

503
00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:02.340
Why the dark ages was so dark.
Lots of poverty,
lots of starvation.

504
00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:06.450
But also as I suggested when I spoke to this earlier,
also the freedom,

505
00:36:06.451 --> 00:36:11.370
if you could make it to learn and also to grow stronger.

506
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:17.540
Now it's sometime in that period of the dark ages and Hanson would suggest,

507
00:36:18.001 --> 00:36:23.001
I think probably around the eighth century is the greatest transition.

508
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:29.450
Somehow the oil costs obtains a chunk of land that is understood to belong to

509
00:36:33.841 --> 00:36:37.620
it.
The Greek word for that is a clay Ross.

510
00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:39.540
He Ros.

511
00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:45.650
And what happens is now the family knows that it has this land.

512
00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:50.870
It has it now,
it will have it next year.
The family will be,

513
00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:55.910
we will be able to pass it on from father to son so that he can inherit it.

514
00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:58.950
And that changes everything.

515
00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:04.580
That kind of stability gives promise and is a basis for making every kind of

516
00:37:06.481 --> 00:37:11.481
necessary investment in the soil that you are working in order to,

517
00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.750
uh,
make it better and more profitable for you.

518
00:37:15.751 --> 00:37:18.990
And it's worth it because you'll be you and your children will be there to

519
00:37:18.991 --> 00:37:21.420
collect it.
As Hanson says,

520
00:37:21.421 --> 00:37:26.421
thus arose to Clara's or the idea of a privately held plot attached not to any

521
00:37:29.131 --> 00:37:34.131
one person but rather in perpetuity to a single farm family or oil costs.

522
00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:39.030
And as Hanson points out,

523
00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:42.900
look at the difference between this and previous ways of working the soil.

524
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:48.200
People either rented the land from a large land owner or they were hired help

525
00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:55.430
who got nothing except a salary or a piece of what they did.

526
00:37:56.190 --> 00:38:00.480
Surfs who are compelled to work the land or in some places even slaves.

527
00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:04.530
Well,
they have no incentive.
Put aside the question,

528
00:38:04.531 --> 00:38:09.531
even if capacity to invest capital for the purpose of uh,

529
00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:15.330
improving the size and quality of their crops,
their trees,
their vines,

530
00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:19.590
they would not be willing to take the risk,
uh,

531
00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:24.180
without clear title to the land.
That is the critical thing.

532
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.560
Once they haven't and they plant permanent crops,

533
00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:34.130
that changes the whole basis of society and the values and the attitudes that go

534
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:38.470
with it.
In short,
according to Hanson,

535
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:42.130
it is the invention of the family farm.

536
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:47.050
That is the critical moment in this very,

537
00:38:47.051 --> 00:38:52.051
very important moment in the history of the human race and there's certainly is

538
00:38:52.511 --> 00:38:57.511
no example of it that I know of apart from Greece when it happens right about

539
00:38:58.901 --> 00:39:02.470
this period.
You can imagine that if this can only happen gradually,

540
00:39:02.471 --> 00:39:03.850
none of this happens overnight.

541
00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:08.920
But if you think of the time span about 900 to 700 BC,

542
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:11.740
that is when these changes are taking place.

543
00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:16.740
I would have guessed at an increasing pace as you go further down the road and

544
00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:23.791
then what happens is the population grows and for this the archeological

545
00:39:25.211 --> 00:39:26.590
evidence is very strong.

546
00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:31.750
There are getting to be more and more people living on the land of Greece.

547
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:33.873
What do they do?

548
00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:38.940
One of the problems that produces is the more people you have up to a point,

549
00:39:38.951 --> 00:39:43.060
that's good.
There are more people who can work to increase the uh,
PR,

550
00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:43.963
the production,

551
00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:49.420
but beyond that point there were more people to feed then the production can

552
00:39:49.421 --> 00:39:54.421
produce and that leads to a desire for expansion of the land available for

553
00:39:56.291 --> 00:39:59.830
cultivation.
Now,
there are a couple of ways that can go.

554
00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:02.100
One that was certainly important,

555
00:40:02.101 --> 00:40:06.370
and again this was something that Hanson emphasizes is what he calls internal

556
00:40:06.371 --> 00:40:09.910
colonization.
It means you know the way these things work.

557
00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:14.590
When you are engaged in agriculture,
it's natural go first to that soil,

558
00:40:14.591 --> 00:40:16.180
to that patch of land,

559
00:40:16.181 --> 00:40:20.770
which is known to be likely to produce the best land,
the most fertile,

560
00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.860
the most best product,
the most fertile land there is.

561
00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:26.950
So that's where they start.

562
00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:31.630
But now when you need more,
you can't just say,
I only want the best bottom land.

563
00:40:31.631 --> 00:40:35.500
There is your move out to someplace that nobody bothered to farm before because

564
00:40:35.501 --> 00:40:38.230
it wasn't profitable enough because you need more lan.

565
00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:43.680
And so marginal land is brought into play with hard work and ingenuity.

566
00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:49.570
And one of the things that Hanson emphasizes that so helpful,

567
00:40:49.571 --> 00:40:51.550
you got to be a farmer to understand these things.

568
00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:56.500
Not everything that you try works.
And the picture,

569
00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:01.030
I think the picture he paints of farming et reminds us of the picture that the

570
00:41:01.031 --> 00:41:05.680
homeowner pays of human condition as explained in the,
you know,

571
00:41:05.681 --> 00:41:09.670
the pot,
the two,
the two jars of Zeus.
Most of the luck is bag.

572
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:15.030
It's hard to succeed and some combination of luck and skill and determination

573
00:41:15.401 --> 00:41:17.320
and hard work,
uh,

574
00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:22.240
all of that will decide which of these farmers will be successful and which will

575
00:41:22.241 --> 00:41:24.280
not.
And that's an important thing to remember.

576
00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:29.260
There'll be success and there will be failure.
Hanson says,
I'm recording him.

577
00:41:29.261 --> 00:41:34.261
The real beginning in the west of individual property holding on a large scale

578
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:37.520
is what he is describing.

579
00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.700
And he wants to emphasize.

580
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:46.270
Hanson himself has a farm that specializes in grapes for the purpose of

581
00:41:46.881 --> 00:41:48.620
producing raisins.

582
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:51.920
I guess all the raisins in the world that produced near Fresno.
Isn't that right?

583
00:41:51.921 --> 00:41:54.300
Curtis?
And uh,

584
00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:01.550
he,
uh,
points out that the knowledge of how to do this,

585
00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:07.540
of how to grow the kind of grapes who want viticulture and also our board

586
00:42:07.701 --> 00:42:11.360
culture,
both of these are learned from Asia.

587
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:12.770
The Asians were ahead.

588
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:17.810
And the the end of the isolation of Greece made possible communication and it

589
00:42:17.811 --> 00:42:22.811
allowed this kind of learning and so you got this picture of some people

590
00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:26.390
learning how to do these things very,
very well.

591
00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.330
Everything is farmed in a new way.

592
00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:34.360
And let me just give you a picture of what this new farm that Hanson describes

593
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:39.620
is like there is intensive farming.

594
00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:43.700
It's not extensive in the sense you know you just have to scatter your stuff

595
00:42:43.701 --> 00:42:47.390
over wide fields.
The same thing over a great,
that's not what it is.

596
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:50.630
Every piece of that soil is necessary.

597
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:55.220
A lot of it can't produce the crop you would most like to grow.

598
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:59.420
So you find another crop that will grow there that can be useful.

599
00:42:59.421 --> 00:43:00.590
That's that's the picture.

600
00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.790
So you have varied crops among them.

601
00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:08.960
These are the ones that are typical of a Mediterranean climate.

602
00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:14.090
Everybody needs grain.
Bread is the staff of life as you have been rightly toll,

603
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:17.450
but so you try.
If you ha,
if you can grow grain on your land,

604
00:43:17.451 --> 00:43:20.150
you grow it where you can,
it's not going to have to get it elsewhere.

605
00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:25.730
Olives for the purposes that I mentioned to you the other day.

606
00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:29.240
That is a very important one.
Um,

607
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:34.990
vegetables can be grown many times in places where you could never grow wheat or

608
00:43:36.061 --> 00:43:40.880
a grain.
Um,
fruits from the trees.

609
00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:45.400
What have I left out,
Curtis?
Anything we left out?
Anything that you,

610
00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:49.790
any of the crops,
that's about it.
And those are the things that you do now.

611
00:43:49.791 --> 00:43:52.070
Observe several things about them.

612
00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:57.770
They together will make up everything you need to live.

613
00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:01.310
All the food groups are represented there.

614
00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:04.910
I have left out meat and fish of course,

615
00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:10.340
neither of them very common in the uh,
in this part of the world.

616
00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:14.990
But meat was common enough because there were sheep and their workouts,

617
00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:18.410
even when,
uh,
beef would have been very hard to get.

618
00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:21.110
But what you need to understand about the Greeks,
they don't eat a lot of meat.

619
00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.850
Now you might say,
how come no fish?
I mean this surrounded by water.

620
00:44:25.851 --> 00:44:27.260
Everywhere you look.
Well,
guess what?

621
00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:32.040
Turns out fish don't live everywhere in the water and they don't live very much

622
00:44:32.041 --> 00:44:35.670
around Greece.
It turns out,
I don't mean no fish,

623
00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:38.280
but no sort of major schools of fish.

624
00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:43.310
This is not the banks of Newfoundland and the Greeks don't eat fish but not a

625
00:44:43.351 --> 00:44:46.170
lot.
So they're dying is a little bit of that.

626
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:50.640
There are some of their protein from that.
Uh,
then bread,
olive oil,

627
00:44:50.641 --> 00:44:54.720
fruit,
vegetables,
cheese,
milk,

628
00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:58.890
those kinds of things they can do
well.
Now,

629
00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:03.300
one of the things farmers in history discovered is that it's very hard to do

630
00:45:03.301 --> 00:45:06.600
well as a farmer and a big,
if you,

631
00:45:06.601 --> 00:45:11.601
all you do is grow the crops because people normally don't use what you grow in

632
00:45:11.851 --> 00:45:15.180
the form in which you grow it.
I'm thinking again of Grapes and Olives,

633
00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:20.280
they made maybe mostly one olive oil.
And why?
So why do you do?
Well,

634
00:45:20.281 --> 00:45:22.110
if you're a poor farmer,
you don't know what else to do.

635
00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:26.530
You send it off to a middleman who does the turning of,
of uh,

636
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:30.690
the grapes and the olives into the liquids that are necessary and he takes a

637
00:45:30.691 --> 00:45:35.040
good bit of the profit.
But these farmers didn't do that.

638
00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:40.560
They acquired the equipment necessary grape,
uh,

639
00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:41.820
and olive presses,

640
00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:46.710
which allowed them to purify and to produce,
uh,

641
00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:51.140
the final product and that made them more successful than they otherwise would

642
00:45:51.141 --> 00:45:53.760
have been.
And also the,

643
00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:56.610
another great thing that you have to be able to do if you're going to succeed as

644
00:45:56.611 --> 00:45:57.241
a pharmacy,
you could be,

645
00:45:57.241 --> 00:46:01.710
I have to have places to store what you produce so that you will have it for

646
00:46:01.711 --> 00:46:03.150
next year when you need it.

647
00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:08.210
And also if you have a surplus and that's a desirable thing to do,

648
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:13.410
you can sell it.
Probably in the early days,

649
00:46:13.411 --> 00:46:15.300
this was largely a question of barter.

650
00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:20.700
You could trade it in for those things that you didn't make yourself and needed.

651
00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:24.750
But any case,
in any case,
it is a profit,
but it's no good if it's going to spoil.

652
00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:29.650
And so it's important to realize the role of ceramics,

653
00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:35.290
the they need to make storage jars that could be sealed very well and preserve

654
00:46:35.881 --> 00:46:39.210
this stuff for a very long time.
And indeed they did that.

655
00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:44.040
Another thing that you need to understand about these farms if you're going to

656
00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:49.070
grasp their significance for the society that will come is that they are small,

657
00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:54.360
really small.
Uh,
maybe a typical,

658
00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:59.520
a farm you might imagine has maybe 10 acres that is a very small farm.

659
00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:04.260
Some of them of course were bigger.
There was no regulation about it,

660
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:09.530
but we are talking not about the emergence of an agricultural aristocracy,

661
00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:13.140
but we are talking about the emergence of a,

662
00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:18.500
an agricultural community of small family farms.

663
00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:25.380
And one of the things that comes with the development of this kind of

664
00:47:25.381 --> 00:47:30.381
agriculture as the policies coming into being is slavery.

665
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:36.780
Now,
of course slavery is as old almost as the human race.
Uh,

666
00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:40.450
and it certainly was already present in the world of Houma.

667
00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.010
Uh,

668
00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:47.010
but it looks like in the dark ages there were very few slaves around.

669
00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:52.180
Just because owning slaves is wealth.

670
00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:56.650
You can't have slaves without wealth because you got to feed them.

671
00:47:56.651 --> 00:48:01.350
That's the very least.
And no matter how wicked a master you are dead slaves on,

672
00:48:01.351 --> 00:48:05.770
no good to you.
Chances are you had to pay something for them.

673
00:48:05.771 --> 00:48:08.880
They are like a machine.
If he slave dies,

674
00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:12.370
got to buy a new machine and while he's alive,
you've got to feed them.

675
00:48:12.371 --> 00:48:16.630
So when you're talking about a very poor society,
not going to see much slavery.

676
00:48:16.631 --> 00:48:20.530
But it is true that as the uh,

677
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:24.490
family farm I've been describing comes into being away,

678
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:29.080
is found to use slaves in a productive,

679
00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:34.110
positive way,
positive from the standpoint of profits.
Um,

680
00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:40.170
and the reason for that is if you are just engaged in a single crop farming,

681
00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:43.090
well you're planted,

682
00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:46.840
you take care of it and then when the time comes you reap it.

683
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:50.470
What do you do in between?
Well,
there's not much to do,

684
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:54.970
so you have to feed the slave all year round to work only a small part of the

685
00:48:54.971 --> 00:48:59.590
time that's not very profitable.
But Hanson's farm is,

686
00:48:59.591 --> 00:49:02.260
I like to think of it.
Uh,

687
00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:07.350
there's work to do all year round because these different crops need attention

688
00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:11.320
at different times and they need different kinds of attention and some of them

689
00:49:11.321 --> 00:49:15.940
need all kinds of very hard work to keep them going so that there's plenty of

690
00:49:15.941 --> 00:49:20.170
work to be done that is useful and profitable.
Therefore,

691
00:49:20.171 --> 00:49:25.171
and you will produce enough profit to make it possible so that these small

692
00:49:25.661 --> 00:49:26.111
farms,

693
00:49:26.111 --> 00:49:31.111
you should imagine as typically having one or two slaves playing a part in this

694
00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:37.990
experience.
And um,
the,
uh,

695
00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:43.060
and if the funding,
I mean you should not imagine when I say slaves,

696
00:49:43.061 --> 00:49:48.061
it just take out of your mind the plantations of the old south because when you

697
00:49:48.431 --> 00:49:49.720
only have one or two slaves,

698
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:54.750
the master is what working right alongside them doing the exactly the same work

699
00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:58.990
that they are doing and also instructing them and telling them what's what.

700
00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:03.820
It's probably if you want to really understand this,
uh,
in a practical sense,

701
00:50:03.821 --> 00:50:08.200
it's more as though these guys are hired hands mean.
They live around,

702
00:50:08.201 --> 00:50:11.680
they live in the house,
they get fed,
preferably with everybody else.

703
00:50:11.681 --> 00:50:13.180
They work with the master.

704
00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:17.560
The difference being that they are slaves rather than a free men.

705
00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:22.440
And uh,
and that's one of the funny things is that the,
the,

706
00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:27.550
the emergence of this family farm gives rise to the Polis,

707
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:33.430
his character as a land in which there was a citizenry which is to say free men

708
00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:38.380
ruled themselves.
So the Polis,
we'll see the,

709
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:42.380
the invention of freedom in this way.
And oddly enough,

710
00:50:42.381 --> 00:50:46.190
it is a company by the growth of slavery.
At the same time,

711
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:51.790
both slavery and freedom come along at the same time in the Greek world.

712
00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:56.630
One of the interesting,
uh,

713
00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:02.680
documents we have is a fragmentary inscription from the island of chaos.

714
00:51:03.981 --> 00:51:07.520
I think it's in the eighth century,
uh,

715
00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:11.210
that Hanson points out as relevant here on it.

716
00:51:11.211 --> 00:51:12.890
There is a little language and it's obvious,

717
00:51:12.891 --> 00:51:17.240
it's talking about some kind of a town council.

718
00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:19.730
This is the first time we have such a reference.

719
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:23.200
The Greek words are Boulay hey day.

720
00:51:23.201 --> 00:51:28.201
Most of the Aa that is best translation I can come up with is the council for

721
00:51:28.911 --> 00:51:29.744
the people.

722
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:34.070
It doesn't mean the council of the people necessarily that would suggest

723
00:51:34.071 --> 00:51:35.300
something democratic.

724
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:39.890
It's probably more a oligarchic or aristocratic.

725
00:51:39.891 --> 00:51:44.300
But the point is,
this is something we haven't heard of ever before.

726
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:49.400
There was clearly some kind of an official group that has some sort of political

727
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:54.230
role to play,
which is popular in its character.

728
00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:57.980
It's the word de Moss that's at the root of day,

729
00:51:57.981 --> 00:52:02.720
most ca and day most means the people,
all the people.

730
00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:06.650
That's one of its meanings and I think it's the meaning that's relevant here.

731
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:09.290
And as Hanson point south,

732
00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:14.320
only in early Greece did independent agrarians have free title to their land,

733
00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:22.630
own slaves.
And ultimately out of this,
uh,

734
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:28.030
council that I told you about ultimately came to have control of their own

735
00:52:29.151 --> 00:52:30.790
communities.
Uh,

736
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:34.730
although the political development came late in the process,

737
00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:37.640
it did come as Hanson says,

738
00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:40.910
the new farmer is not just a different kind of farming,

739
00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:44.180
but a different kind of person.

740
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:49.610
He is a citizen in his political role.

741
00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:55.090
He is a soldier but he is the soldier not in the pay or the higher of a King of

742
00:52:58.310 --> 00:52:59.450
an aristocracy.

743
00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:04.870
He is a citizen soldier who has participated in the decision that says it is

744
00:53:06.381 --> 00:53:11.381
time to go to war and who will play an active role in making decisions about his

745
00:53:13.551 --> 00:53:15.710
state's policy and behavior.

746
00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:22.490
He is independent in a way that nobody who was not a king or an aristocrat and

747
00:53:22.491 --> 00:53:26.640
the past has ever been a new kind of man.

748
00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:27.960
<v 1>Okay.</v>

749
00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:31.890
<v 0>The backbone of the Polis as it emerges.</v>

750
00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:35.310
I don't want to overstate this.
There will still,

751
00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:40.340
there is still an aristocracy made up of the old guys and they don't just

752
00:53:41.911 --> 00:53:46.911
disappear and they will be a long stretch in which there will be some degree of

753
00:53:46.951 --> 00:53:51.951
conflict between these new independent farmers and the old established

754
00:53:52.081 --> 00:53:57.060
aristocracy and never does that aristocracy go away.
That's all.

755
00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:02.660
I'm simply emphasizing what's new in the situation and it's very new indeed.

756
00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:07.230
I might just say a little bit more of

757
00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:13.990
Hansen as ax marvelous situation in which he's a scholar telling us about these,

758
00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:21.120
these developments in the world of ancient agriculture and farming.

759
00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:26.460
But he's also an active farmer and reacting to what happens to farmers today.

760
00:54:26.461 --> 00:54:27.570
And he's written a book,

761
00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:31.980
a wonderful book called fields without dreams,

762
00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:36.460
which is the story of modern farming in America with,

763
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:40.020
it's also true of all of Western Europe,
uh,

764
00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:43.140
which is to do pretty much with the abolition of farmers.

765
00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:47.220
And I just don't think it's right for me to pass without mentioning the

766
00:54:47.221 --> 00:54:50.340
significance of that.
Nobody knows anything about it.
Uh,

767
00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:56.330
what percentage of Americans do you think worked on farms at the end of the 19th

768
00:54:56.971 --> 00:54:57.804
century?

769
00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:04.670
2060 you better believe it's 60,
70.

770
00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.400
And the further back you go in American history,

771
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:12.620
the closer to 90 and 95% it gets.
That's the history of the world.

772
00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:18.100
The whole human race has spent the bulk of its time farming.

773
00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:20.480
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

774
00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:23.450
<v 0>What percentage of Americans are engaged in farming today?</v>

775
00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:25.641
Well,

776
00:55:25.641 --> 00:55:30.641
the figure I saw last was a number too small to be mentioned.

777
00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:35.300
I mean to say you just can't really say how much it is,
but all right,
2%.

778
00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:37.580
Does anybody know a farmer?

779
00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:39.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

780
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:40.100
<v 0>How,
how come?</v>

781
00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:45.140
Just by accident still still farming.

782
00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:50.690
God bless him.
Is his son farming.
No kidding.

783
00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:55.520
Where is this?
Fantastic.
That's a marvelous thing.

784
00:55:55.940 --> 00:56:00.170
Please give him my greetings.
Um,
but it,

785
00:56:00.171 --> 00:56:03.770
it's kind of a miracle.
I don't know any farmers.
Oh yeah,

786
00:56:03.771 --> 00:56:06.380
I know Hanson but I didn't know him.
I wouldn't know any farmers.

787
00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:11.920
So now I don't want to go too deeply into this if you're interested in this

788
00:56:11.931 --> 00:56:15.870
subject,
get hold of his book.
But uh,

789
00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:21.010
I think it's really what is inescapable is farmers are a sociological category

790
00:56:21.831 --> 00:56:22.664
of people,

791
00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:27.640
different from non farmers and all kinds of critical ways.

792
00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:32.310
And it is just as a example of how,
uh,

793
00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:35.950
this whole business has disappeared.
Nobody even thinks about it anymore.

794
00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:37.540
If you were to say to me,

795
00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:41.710
what do you think is the most important thing,

796
00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:46.770
however you define thing that has changed the character of life in the United

797
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.090
States in the 20th century?

798
00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:53.380
I would say the disappearance of farmers.

799
00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:59.670
There are so many ways in which that has changed the world,

800
00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:02.650
but I can't do justice to it,
but Hanson does.

801
00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:05.080
So if you want to read fields without dreams,

802
00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:10.240
you can ponder the significance of this great change.
Now,

803
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:15.270
I've talked to you essentially about the economic aspect of this a phenomenon

804
00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:22.060
and I'd like to turn a next week.
Give me a second here.

805
00:57:22.061 --> 00:57:24.430
I just want to find out where I am in this,

806
00:57:30.030 --> 00:57:30.863
right?

807
00:57:33.970 --> 00:57:37.300
These are all my proofs to tell you to support all the things that I've already

808
00:57:37.301 --> 00:57:41.200
told you,
but I'm not going to bother approving it.
Take too long.

809
00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:45.540
Uh,
well

810
00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:52.890
I guess the next thing I might mention is in the area of politics,

811
00:57:55.720 --> 00:58:00.340
if you look at the world of my Sini,
once again,
we've already seen this.

812
00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:05.050
You have a despotism of some kind.
You have some kind of a Lord.

813
00:58:05.051 --> 00:58:07.690
I mean a king if for lack of a better name,

814
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:12.990
Almanor who fundamentally rules and everybody is subject to him.

815
00:58:13.091 --> 00:58:15.610
He has an aristocracy around them.
He has lot kind of helpers,

816
00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:19.480
but he's the boss and that's what you see in the world everywhere else.

817
00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:22.990
Uh,
after that,

818
00:58:23.350 --> 00:58:26.800
if you examine as best we can,

819
00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:31.920
the cities of the dark ages and ask what kind of government,

820
00:58:32.651 --> 00:58:36.100
if you want to use that word with these communities,
have had,

821
00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:42.150
you probably wouldn't do badly if you looked at the odyssey for the best clues

822
00:58:44.141 --> 00:58:46.690
you could find.
If of course they won't be perfect.
You know,

823
00:58:46.691 --> 00:58:49.810
this mixed character of the world of homer,
but still,

824
00:58:50.530 --> 00:58:53.590
if you look at the world of Odysseus is home.

825
00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:57.180
What's going on in um,
uh,

826
00:58:57.190 --> 00:59:00.130
in Ithica there were some valuable clues.

827
00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:06.150
There is somebody who in that world called a bus allows a busted loose,

828
00:59:06.491 --> 00:59:10.520
I should say no.
Yeah,
busted lawyers,
right?
Who is a,

829
00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:16.180
a single individual who was understood to be superior in some way for everybody

830
00:59:16.181 --> 00:59:20.320
else.
However,
he's not very superior to everybody else.

831
00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:25.920
He has all of these nobleman around him,
all of whom claim to be vacillates.

832
00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:29.200
You Recall?
And what a fair way to put this with that.

833
00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:32.630
This is largely an heiress to credit society.

834
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:36.410
That was our conclusion after we looked at the poems of homer.

835
00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:39.800
And I think that's what continues even after the,

836
00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:44.830
when that's the world that shows up after my senior people who had power by

837
00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:49.630
virtue of their wealth,
by virtue of their personal,
uh,

838
00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:53.840
physical strength,
maybe,
uh,
by virtue of their dissent.

839
00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:58.940
Because people always have theories about individuals and their society.
I mean,

840
00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:02.900
early societies who were born to the purple,
so to speak.

841
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:05.120
But whatever the criteria were,

842
01:00:05.121 --> 01:00:10.121
and birth always was a critical criterion in the days of the aristocracies.

843
01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:15.560
Uh,
you would have aristocracies who would have the,
uh,
practical,

844
01:00:15.561 --> 01:00:18.650
the de facto control of things.
Well,

845
01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:21.740
by definition and aristocracy is plural,
not singular.

846
01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:25.460
So how do you make decisions in an aristocracy?

847
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:29.210
And the answer typically is a council,
I use the word council,

848
01:00:29.211 --> 01:00:33.350
the Greek word is Boulay,
uh,
and not assembly,

849
01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:38.950
which in Greek comes to be called Ekklesia.
Um,

850
01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.200
because in that clay,

851
01:00:42.201 --> 01:00:47.201
sia is understood to be a gathering of the entire adult male population.

852
01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:53.150
And the Boulay is understood to be not a,

853
01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:54.800
a gathering of the whole,

854
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:59.780
but rather a smaller group who has some degree of authority.

855
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:04.130
And I would have suggested that in the earliest days,
uh,

856
01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:07.970
they had all the authority that mattered.
However,
it's interesting,

857
01:01:07.971 --> 01:01:09.570
these Greek communities from earlier,

858
01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:14.590
very early time seem to have been different from the Mycenaean kinds of things

859
01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:20.170
by virtue of the fact that the men who fought in the army always seem to have

860
01:01:21.531 --> 01:01:25.610
had to be consulted when it came to a question of fighting.

861
01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:30.970
And so you always had an assembly,
even an error,

862
01:01:30.971 --> 01:01:35.420
Socratic states,
but decisions in general were made by aristocrats.
Moreover,

863
01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:39.110
the law was interpreted,
spoken,

864
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:41.390
and to the agreed to a degree.

865
01:01:41.391 --> 01:01:46.391
It had to be enforced by the aristocrats working through a council in their

866
01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:49.423
community.

867
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:54.910
And these councils might have been elective from within the aristocracy or they

868
01:01:57.981 --> 01:02:02.981
could have been simply the whole aristocracy depending really on the size of the

869
01:02:03.831 --> 01:02:07.910
community because you can't have a council functioning to any useful purpose.

870
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:11.090
If it gets to be too big,
it just becomes something else.

871
01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:14.180
That's where you start.
That's the dark ages.

872
01:02:14.181 --> 01:02:19.181
Now what we shall see as the polos grows and develops and these changes in the,

873
01:02:21.031 --> 01:02:24.690
uh,
economic situation that I've described are happening,

874
01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:29.910
is that these successful farmers

875
01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:33.990
who will,
as I will be telling you next time,

876
01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:39.530
who also will be the fighting men who fight for their Polis,

877
01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:43.560
uh,
in as infantry men,

878
01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:48.180
when the infantry becomes the critically important part of the army,

879
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:53.250
these men,
the combination of their independence,
their wealth.

880
01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.410
I don't,
when I say wealth,
I don't mean great wealth,

881
01:02:55.411 --> 01:02:56.940
but the fact that they do have wealth,

882
01:02:56.941 --> 01:03:01.941
that they amount to something and their role as soldiers makes them demand a

883
01:03:03.361 --> 01:03:08.361
larger voice in the government of the state and the decisions that affect them

884
01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:15.210
so closely.
And so there will be a whole,

885
01:03:15.211 --> 01:03:18.270
I'm looking ahead now projecting into some topics that we'll explore more

886
01:03:18.271 --> 01:03:19.104
closely later,

887
01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:24.380
but they will be finding different ways to insist on their inclusion and their

888
01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:31.880
results will be different in every state in sometimes the old aristocracy we'll

889
01:03:34.381 --> 01:03:39.381
be able to hold on for a very long time and to suppress any,

890
01:03:40.411 --> 01:03:45.170
a attempt to change things other times.
Uh,

891
01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:49.230
and this will be widespread in certain places and it will be very significant.

892
01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:52.290
The dissatisfied people in the society,

893
01:03:52.291 --> 01:03:55.900
mainly these farmers I'm talking about.
Uh,

894
01:03:55.950 --> 01:04:00.950
we'll get together and perhaps fix on some discontented aristocratic individuals

895
01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:05.910
and most particularly pick some aristocrat who has distinguished himself

896
01:04:05.911 --> 01:04:07.860
typically as a soldier,

897
01:04:07.861 --> 01:04:12.510
as a leader of troops and engage really in what amounts to a kind of a

898
01:04:12.511 --> 01:04:17.511
revolution or at least a coup and bring about a kind of a different kind of a

899
01:04:19.111 --> 01:04:22.230
monarchy,
which the Greeks called a tyranny.

900
01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.110
And when these tyrannize take place,

901
01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:29.820
they last for different periods of time.
But when the tyrant is removed,

902
01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:34.620
what follows after that is there was never again in that town,

903
01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:39.830
one man rule of any kind either what is established after the,

904
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:42.990
the tyranny is an oligarchy.

905
01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:48.560
But notice I didn't say aristocracy and oligarchy just means rule of the few.

906
01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.750
But as we shall see,
what changes is,

907
01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:54.690
is no longer the rule of those who,

908
01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.410
those few who are born in the right place.

909
01:04:58.830 --> 01:05:02.640
It will be based upon the wealth of those people.

910
01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:07.820
And that means that the newly wealthy or the newly well reasonably well off will

911
01:05:10.021 --> 01:05:14.370
participate in their government.
And the form of government,

912
01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:19.390
which is oligarchy,
will be throughout the classical period,

913
01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:24.420
the most characteristic form of government in Greek city states.

914
01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:27.400
When democracy is invented,

915
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:31.750
it will have its moment and it will spread and there will be numerous

916
01:05:31.751 --> 01:05:36.310
democracies,
but they will never be the majority of the police.

917
01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:40.900
Your typical Polis will be a kind of uh,

918
01:05:41.850 --> 01:05:41.980
uh,

919
01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:46.980
Hanson farmer outfit where people from that class and up we'll participate in

920
01:05:51.491 --> 01:05:52.324
politics,

921
01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:56.740
will be the governing bodies in their state.

922
01:05:56.860 --> 01:06:01.860
They will be the ones who continue to fight in that infantry that is decisive

923
01:06:02.531 --> 01:06:05.930
for the state.
And they will be the ones who,
uh,

924
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:11.110
make decisions and the people poorer than they will be excluded.

925
01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:16.620
So it's very important to realize that these family farmers who are successful

926
01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:21.760
do not necessarily lead to democracy.
Indeed,

927
01:06:21.761 --> 01:06:23.410
I want to emphasize again,

928
01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:27.760
it is an unusual outcome when they end up with democracy.

929
01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:32.110
So now we've said something about the economic change and something about the

930
01:06:32.111 --> 01:06:32.950
political change,

931
01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:38.250
and the next hour I'll start with the story of the military change that has so

932
01:06:38.801 --> 01:06:41.440
many significant consequences.
Okay.
