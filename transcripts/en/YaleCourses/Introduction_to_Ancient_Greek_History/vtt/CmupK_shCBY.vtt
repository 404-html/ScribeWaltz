WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:01.650
Okay.

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.650
We were talking about the development of the Athenian Empire,

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:07.860
um,

4
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.810
changing from the original character of the Delian League.

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.660
I think we've gotten to the battle of you Rimma Don,

6
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:18.510
which is generally data to four 69,

7
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:23.511
the great victory at land and sea over the Persians and the

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.890
feeling that it generated certainly in some portions of the empire that the

9
00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:33.540
threat from Persia was over.

10
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.650
And that created the problem of keeping the,
uh,

11
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.520
allies,
uh,

12
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.150
satisfied and willing to make the kind of contribution that had been necessary.

13
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:47.850
The,
it Samian certainly had no plan

14
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.960
of abandoning the league,
of abandoning their leadership,

15
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:56.580
of giving up their assaults on the Persians and all of that.
Uh,

16
00:00:56.581 --> 00:00:58.530
so that if there was a falling away,

17
00:00:58.531 --> 00:01:01.470
the Athenians would be wanting to do something about that.

18
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.970
Still another turning point in the character of the league,

19
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.540
a very important one I think occurred in the year four 65 when the island of say

20
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:18.000
sauce in the northern Aegean Sea rebelled.

21
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.540
And this time the quarrel was not about,
uh,

22
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.360
doing the duty that the members of the league had to do.

23
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:29.940
It was not about,
uh,

24
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.190
something that was an issue,
not wanting to take part of campaigns,

25
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:37.710
not wanting to make payments,
no,
nothing like that.

26
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.220
There was a quarrel between the Athenians and the Asians about some minds that

27
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.440
were worked on the land opposite,
say sauce,

28
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.790
gold and silver,
very rich,
uh,

29
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.430
precious metal sources for the ancient Greek world of which there were not many

30
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.350
located on Mt.
Penn GN on the mainland opposite say sauce.

31
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.040
Both states claimed those minds and it was a quarrel that was really just about

32
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.400
money.
Uh,

33
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.190
there was also a trading post up there that both sides claimed to have.

34
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.570
The Athenians had established a colony,

35
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.950
uh,
at a place on the strike.

36
00:02:24.951 --> 00:02:28.700
I'm on river up in that region called and they are,
oh boy,

37
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.260
the nine roads,
uh,

38
00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:34.680
which will lay there when the Athenians established it as a colony would be cold

39
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.090
and fearless.
Uh,
all of that led to an end.

40
00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:42.750
The Ephesians didn't like that the Athenians were moving into their sphere of

41
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:45.180
influence and giving them trouble.

42
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.090
So they saw us as a consequence of all of these quarrels rebuilt.

43
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.730
And it was a very difficult siege that the Athenians had to employ face us as a

44
00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:58.200
relatively big island,

45
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.950
that Asians are a pretty tough group to put down.

46
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.050
And the siege,
actually,

47
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:10.051
the war between Athens and face faces actually took something like two years,

48
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.850
which is quite a long stretch for any Greek combat and certainly had not been

49
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:20.410
typical of what the Athenians had been able to do against other rebellions.

50
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.730
When the,
uh,
uh,

51
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.520
Asians were finally forced to surrender,

52
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.810
the Athenians gave them the usual treatment too.
Rebellious states,

53
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:36.811
they made them take down their walls to give up their ships.

54
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.360
And of course the Athenians took control of the minds and placed and indemnity

55
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.560
on the Asians requiring that they should pay the costs of the war for Athens and

56
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:53.710
the imposed upon them thereafter,

57
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:58.711
the same kind of attribute that they imposed on what came in more and more to B

58
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.100
two B and we'll called subject states.
Well,

59
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.930
that wasn't the first time such a thing had happened to one of the members of

60
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:08.291
the league.

61
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:13.090
But what made it different was that the quarrel was not over.

62
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:15.700
Anything that had to do with the league,

63
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.480
it could easily be seen in certainly was a way in which the Athenians used the

64
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:27.511
forces and the funds of the League to achieve strictly Athenian advantages.

65
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.631
After all,

66
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:35.890
it was no way that the league benefited from having either Athens or face us

67
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:39.010
exploit those mines.
It was not an issue for the league at all.

68
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:43.690
And yet the Athenians had taken their position as leaders of the league to gain

69
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.790
that advantage.
And that's I think a very important turning point.

70
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.960
Uh,

71
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.960
we shall see that it was in the course of that siege of say sauce important

72
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:57.970
events were happening back in the mainland of Greece,

73
00:04:57.971 --> 00:05:01.150
which would change the nature of things too.
But,
uh,

74
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.460
if we just think about the league for a moment,

75
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:08.461
I think decision rebellion is a critical moment and that is a good place for us

76
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:10.510
to look at.

77
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.540
The evaluation that the ancient writers made of this transition are two.

78
00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:19.960
Two sources are a major source of course,

79
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:23.200
the acidities and then also dive doors of Sicily,

80
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.800
a deriving his opinions from contemporary writers to come up with descriptions

81
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:36.991
and explanations of why the league changed from what had been a free association

82
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:44.791
of states pursuing a common goal to what was legitimately called an empire.

83
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:48.730
Here is what Diet Doris says.

84
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.400
He says in general,

85
00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:56.401
the Athenians were making great gains in power and no longer treated allies with

86
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:02.270
decency as they had done before.
Instead,

87
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.480
they ruled with arrogance and violence.

88
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.400
For this reason,

89
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.430
most of their allies could not bear their harshness and spoke to one another of

90
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:13.814
rebellion.

91
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.480
Some of them even disdained the lead counsel and active according to their own

92
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.930
wishes.
So did die.

93
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.960
Doors pick depicts a combined situation of which there are thoughts of the

94
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:34.211
affection and actual defections from Athens and blames this on the behavior of

95
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:40.070
the Athenians have a kind of a tyrannical sort.
Here's what's acidities says

96
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.450
now,
while there were other causes of revolts,

97
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:50.110
the principle ones where the failures in bringing in the tribute or their quota

98
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:56.711
of ships and in some cases refusal of military service for the Athenians exacted

99
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.960
the tribute strictly and gave a fence by applying coercive measures to any who

100
00:07:05.961 --> 00:07:09.470
were accustomed or unwilling to bear the hardships of service.

101
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:15.750
And in some other respects to the Athenians were no longer equally agreeable as

102
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:17.744
leaders.

103
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.260
They would not take part in expeditions on terms of equality and they found it

104
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.900
easy to reduce those who had revolted.

105
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.640
Now here's where through acidities differs from Daya doors for all this.

106
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:39.200
The allies themselves were responsible for most of them.

107
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:40.431
Uh,
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:40.431 --> 00:07:44.960
For most of them on account of their aversion to military service in order to

109
00:07:44.961 --> 00:07:49.961
avoid being away from home got themselves rated in sums of money instead of

110
00:07:50.601 --> 00:07:54.890
ships,
which they should pay in as their proportion of contribution.

111
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:56.630
And consequently,

112
00:07:56.631 --> 00:08:01.520
the fleet of the Athenians was increased by the funds which they contributed

113
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.140
while they themselves,

114
00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:08.141
whenever they revolted entered on the war without preparation and without

115
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.230
experience.

116
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:14.590
So the acidities certainly agrees with what dinosaur is says about the high

117
00:08:15.441 --> 00:08:20.030
hand,
his manner in which the Athenians had become accustomed to behave and the

118
00:08:20.031 --> 00:08:22.550
offense they gave to their allies.

119
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.820
But he points out that the allies had gotten themselves into that fixed because

120
00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:32.900
many of them,
and this is an element died Dorris doesn't mention,

121
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.880
voluntarily said,
okay,
look,
we're not going to do this service anymore.

122
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:42.890
Instead of going supplying ships,
manning them,
doing the service ourselves,

123
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:47.690
we will pay the equivalent some into the league treasury.

124
00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:52.250
And when they did so the Athenians took that money and used it to pay for

125
00:08:52.251 --> 00:08:57.251
Athenian ships with Athenian rowers so that as the league forces grew smaller,

126
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.800
the Athenian navy grew bigger and so through acidity says it's,

127
00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:06.960
they're all full.
In some cases it was not,

128
00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:09.840
but certainly in many a case it was,

129
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:14.790
I think we should not think of Diet Doris and aunts acidities as contradicting

130
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:17.070
each other.
They really are complimentary.

131
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:22.400
They're both telling the same story but emphasizing a different perspective.

132
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.710
That one looked at it from the Athenian point of view,

133
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:27.900
one from the allied point of view.

134
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.890
But they certainly are telling it as it was.

135
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:36.420
And if we look ahead toward the end of the fifth century,

136
00:09:36.421 --> 00:09:41.421
by the time we get to the Peloponnesian war of all the hundred and 50 or more

137
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.680
states that were members of the original Delian League,

138
00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:52.390
only three still had a navy and real autonomy.

139
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:58.350
By the time the war broke out,
three great islands off the coast of Asia Minor,

140
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.700
uh,
less boss kiose and Samos where those states,

141
00:10:02.701 --> 00:10:06.030
and sorry I should have said too,
because by four 44,

142
00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:10.160
44 39 Samos lost its independence.

143
00:10:10.161 --> 00:10:13.290
So there are only two states in that category.

144
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.410
Looking ahead,
that's what will happen.

145
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.680
That's what will be the end of the Delian League.

146
00:10:19.681 --> 00:10:23.880
It will be the Athenian Empire in every respect.

147
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:29.160
Now,
while this development was taking place,

148
00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:34.020
we need to take a look at what was happening back in the Greek world on the

149
00:10:34.021 --> 00:10:36.400
mainland.
And,
uh,
chiefly,

150
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:40.890
I think we should focus on Athens for this.
Uh,
at this time,

151
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:46.110
there was right after the,
uh,
the Persian wars.

152
00:10:46.111 --> 00:10:47.760
I said a few words about it before,

153
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.760
a rising competition for a place of standing in the Greek world.

154
00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:00.330
That is to say before the Persian wars were over,

155
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:05.540
Sparta had been unquestionably the leader of the Greeks when challenged by an

156
00:11:06.811 --> 00:11:11.460
outside force after the war.
The mystically as you recall,

157
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.190
uh,

158
00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:17.190
and obviously with the Athenians at his back asserted at the very least,

159
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:22.490
equality with the Spartans and certainly independence of any position of

160
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:29.370
following the Spartans are any grant of leadership to the Spartans.

161
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.650
And as I think I mentioned last time,

162
00:11:31.651 --> 00:11:36.651
the next 50 years or so are the story of the competition between these two great

163
00:11:38.821 --> 00:11:43.821
powers within the Greek world for who would be the leader and there would be

164
00:11:43.921 --> 00:11:48.921
many a clash in the course of that time in Athens.

165
00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.070
The remarkable thing is if you look at the internal development of Athens,

166
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:57.530
think you would have said enforced 79,
uh,
some is,

167
00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:02.590
is bound to rise to the top and become the dominant politician in Athens because

168
00:12:03.551 --> 00:12:05.650
of his extraordinary play.

169
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.970
A role in bringing victory to the Greeks.
But a,

170
00:12:09.971 --> 00:12:12.100
these things don't always happen that way.
I,

171
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:17.230
I think of course about the second world war where one might have thought the

172
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:21.610
same thing about Winston Churchill's future in English politics,

173
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.930
but no,
no.
Um,

174
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.400
no sooner was the war one and I think,
you know,

175
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.860
Churchill would have had to gain and was given enormous credit for bringing

176
00:12:32.861 --> 00:12:34.590
about that victory.
Uh,

177
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:39.430
there was an election almost immediately after the war and Churchill was thrown

178
00:12:39.431 --> 00:12:42.850
out and replaced by his opponents,

179
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.170
which tells you about,
uh,

180
00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.420
the first rule of democratic politics.

181
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:54.430
The first important question that has to be put to all politicians,

182
00:12:54.431 --> 00:12:58.420
which is what have you done for me lately?
Well,
he had done quite a lot lately.

183
00:12:58.421 --> 00:13:00.300
So there's another question that you have to put is,

184
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:03.460
what are you going to do for me next?
I think that was really,

185
00:13:03.461 --> 00:13:06.820
what was that Churchill's problem that was not some mystical,

186
00:13:06.821 --> 00:13:10.280
he's problem to mystic.
Lee's ran into trouble because he,

187
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:15.310
he was a kind of a maverick in Athenian politics anyway,

188
00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:20.400
although on,
at least on one side of his family,
he was a nobleman.

189
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.740
Unlike the typical Athenian leader,
uh,

190
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.240
he was not of the,

191
00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.110
the real sort of center of the aristocracy.

192
00:13:29.111 --> 00:13:34.110
There's some kind of a less than extraordinary,
uh,

193
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:39.070
uh,
nobility in part of his family and his personality.

194
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:44.820
People fantas his rivals found troubling because he was not a verse to a basking

195
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:53.230
in the glory that he had one.
Um,
but think back,

196
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.330
um,
in the 80s,

197
00:13:55.331 --> 00:13:59.290
in the years between marathon and Salmas,

198
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.800
on the one hand,
it's a mystic.
Lee's had,
um,

199
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.780
enabled to convince the Athenians to do what they needed to do to survive,

200
00:14:07.781 --> 00:14:12.400
to build that great fleets out of the silver mines that they had striking the

201
00:14:12.401 --> 00:14:17.290
silver mines that they had been lucky enough to have.
But also he had managed,

202
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.170
if,
uh,
my reading of the facts is correct,

203
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:25.800
get to get rid of every one of his major political opponents by making use of

204
00:14:26.801 --> 00:14:29.200
the device of ostracism.

205
00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.200
If you look at the eighties,

206
00:14:32.201 --> 00:14:37.150
you will see that just about every important Athenian political figure is

207
00:14:37.151 --> 00:14:42.151
ostracized with the exception of the mystical lees who was left in great shape

208
00:14:43.361 --> 00:14:46.540
while the other folks are gone.
And when the Persians come,

209
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:51.870
the ostracized men are recalled and play a role in the war.

210
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.640
And when the war is over,
it's obvious.

211
00:14:55.641 --> 00:15:00.500
I think that they are both not happy with what's the mystical he's had achieved

212
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:05.530
against them and also worried about their prospects for the future with the

213
00:15:05.811 --> 00:15:08.510
mystical,
he's being a bigger hero than he ever was.

214
00:15:08.511 --> 00:15:13.130
So what I think we have begun to understand Athenian politics in the years after

215
00:15:13.131 --> 00:15:13.910
the Persian war.

216
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:18.140
We must understand that there is some kind of a coalition,

217
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:22.970
formal or otherwise in which all the great leaders of the Athenian,

218
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.600
uh,
political world combined to keep some mystical.

219
00:15:27.601 --> 00:15:29.930
He's down amazingly enough.

220
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:35.060
When we take a look at the early actions of the Delian League in which in every

221
00:15:35.061 --> 00:15:39.500
case,
remember the commander of every expedition isn't Athenian.

222
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:44.450
It's never some mystical Lee's whom you would have imagined would have been

223
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.220
leading all these expeditions.

224
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:50.930
He just didn't have the political clout to get the assignment.

225
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:56.290
The man who did was a relatively young man by the name of on a nobleman.

226
00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:02.750
He was the son of [inaudible],
the great hero at a marathon.

227
00:16:02.751 --> 00:16:06.860
And he started out his political career with the problems his,
his,
uh,

228
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.980
his father had been condemned,
uh,

229
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.570
the at bay just before his death.
He had also left a very,

230
00:16:14.571 --> 00:16:18.770
a great debt that came on,
had to repay.

231
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:24.190
But a Cayman established himself as a great figure in the Persian wars.

232
00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.800
And a very soon afterwards,

233
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:32.950
we see him taking the lead in every campaign pretty much that the Delian league

234
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.640
launches.
And he is stunningly successful.

235
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:42.590
He's obviously a great commander on land and at sea.

236
00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.490
He's in charge of the great victory at you Ramadan.

237
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:51.590
And so as Athens goes from greatness to greatness,

238
00:16:51.591 --> 00:16:56.330
from success to success and glory to glory.
And from wealth to wealth,

239
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.560
uh,

240
00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:02.180
Kimani becomes this extraordinarily popular with the masses.

241
00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:07.660
And it's interesting because he was not the sort of a man who appealed to the

242
00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:14.390
lower classes.
He was a nobleman himself and he never backed off that.

243
00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:18.540
And as we shall see in a moment,
uh,
his,
his,
uh,

244
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:22.130
prejudices about foreign relations were not the popular ones.

245
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.700
He was a great supporter of Sparta,

246
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:30.970
a great friend of Sparta who regularly spoke about the virtues of Sparta and the

247
00:17:31.761 --> 00:17:36.110
spartan system and how Athens could learn something from Sparta.

248
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:40.880
How such a man could have been elected general year after year by the masses of

249
00:17:40.881 --> 00:17:45.350
the Athenians is a question we need to approach.
Um,

250
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:50.500
but he,
the virtues that he had were,
uh,

251
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.870
to some considerable degree personal that is not only was I think first and

252
00:17:54.871 --> 00:17:59.871
foremost was the enormous success he had and commanding the Athenian forces had

253
00:18:00.091 --> 00:18:03.210
brought all the things I've mentioned and,
and wealth because the,

254
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:08.690
the league expeditions attacking various Persian territory's brought booty,

255
00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:14.690
which was to some extent divided up among the armies that did the fighting so

256
00:18:16.441 --> 00:18:21.441
that the Athenian soldiers and sailors actually made a profit out of these

257
00:18:22.831 --> 00:18:27.810
conquests of Persian territory or raids on Persian territory naturally that

258
00:18:27.811 --> 00:18:29.910
their commander was popular on that score.

259
00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:35.240
But he had those personal skills that are successful in democratic politics.

260
00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:41.370
He just,
people liked him.
He had,
I'm reminded of a,

261
00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:46.620
the same political phenomenon in America.
In the case of Eisenhower,

262
00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:52.580
Eisenhower of course had first become the popular politician because of his

263
00:18:54.001 --> 00:18:56.670
victory in the Second World War.

264
00:18:56.671 --> 00:19:00.750
He was in command of the European theater and got all the credit or a lot of

265
00:19:00.751 --> 00:19:05.130
credit for the victory.
But he had these qualities that made people like him,

266
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:10.290
of which,
you know,
trivial things can be very important.
In Eisenhower's case,

267
00:19:10.291 --> 00:19:14.190
they liked his smile.
People talked about it all the time.

268
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:19.230
Uh,
and uh,
it turned out he was unbeatable in politics.

269
00:19:19.231 --> 00:19:23.850
And it was a little bit like that in the case of on,
uh,

270
00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:26.160
even though again,
Eisenhower was not on the,

271
00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:30.420
on the sort of the populous side of these things.
He was after all a Republican,

272
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.960
uh,
and he turned out he was pretty orthodox in that sense.
Well,

273
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.910
it came on,
held to a very conservative position,

274
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:44.020
as I will tell you about in just a moment.
So,
uh,

275
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:48.300
but the fact is he becomes the dominant politician and Athens,

276
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:53.630
if you think of him rising to the top as early as four 79 when the war is over.

277
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.530
And then we know that his period of,
of,
uh,

278
00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:02.630
political success in Athens ends in the year for 62,

279
00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:07.290
uh,
that's a 17 years stretch,
which is at a very,

280
00:20:07.291 --> 00:20:12.291
very long time for a politician to continue to be the leading figure in this

281
00:20:13.281 --> 00:20:15.690
state,
in Athens,
remembering Athenian general.

282
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:20.910
And it turns out that the development of the Athenian democracy was that it was

283
00:20:20.911 --> 00:20:25.911
the generals who came to be the leading figures politically in the state.

284
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:32.400
And the generals have to be elected every year.

285
00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:38.210
So think about how consistently you have to be popular with the masses in order

286
00:20:38.461 --> 00:20:42.180
to achieve the leadership that came on did.

287
00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:47.710
Um,
his pro spartan foreign policy,

288
00:20:47.711 --> 00:20:49.810
I think is a very critical part of the tail.

289
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.310
And I think things would have been very,

290
00:20:51.311 --> 00:20:55.390
very different if the mystic Lee's had been the dominant politician because it

291
00:20:55.391 --> 00:20:58.840
was clear that from what he'd already done and what he will do later,

292
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:04.260
that he was anti Spartan and urging a Athenian independence from Sparta and,

293
00:21:06.101 --> 00:21:10.930
and really hostility between the two sides.
Uh,
came on to the contrary.

294
00:21:10.931 --> 00:21:15.190
He was the official representative of Sparta in Athens.

295
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:19.870
Uh,
he had long family associations with them.
He went around and explaining,

296
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.700
as I said,
uh,

297
00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:27.060
the virtues of the Spartans and how good it would be for Athens to emulate some

298
00:21:27.401 --> 00:21:28.990
of them.
But more important than that.

299
00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:34.440
He was always in favor of a policy that had Athens and Sparta allies together

300
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:42.240
equals as they had been in his mind,
uh,

301
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:44.920
in the,
uh,
great Persian war,

302
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.530
when a fundamentally the Spartan said,

303
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:52.590
led the great one and led in one the great victory or on land that placea the

304
00:21:52.661 --> 00:21:57.661
Athenians had lead and won the victory at Salomon [inaudible] at sea and the two

305
00:21:58.211 --> 00:21:59.710
states collaborated,

306
00:21:59.711 --> 00:22:03.390
cooperated and in that's how af has,

307
00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:06.400
that's how the Greeks were freed from the Persian menace.

308
00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:11.080
And that's how Greece would prosper and be safe in the future.

309
00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:16.650
And it worked some part of the fact that the Spartans did not object to the

310
00:22:19.961 --> 00:22:24.961
developments in the gene and across the Aegean in which Athens moved from being

311
00:22:25.871 --> 00:22:30.871
merely the leader of a coalition to becoming an imperial power stronger every

312
00:22:31.721 --> 00:22:36.160
day.
The Spartans didn't do a thing about it in those early years.

313
00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.090
Why not?

314
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:42.090
I think a major reason was because Keeman was the dominant figure in Athens.

315
00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:46.000
They trusted came on.

316
00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:50.110
They knew that so long as he was in that position,

317
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:52.510
he would not be a menace to Sparta.

318
00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:57.250
And that they could indeed live side by side in this way.

319
00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:02.350
It was a stretch of time,
15,
17,

320
00:23:02.351 --> 00:23:07.330
something like that,
years which was peaceful.
Uh,

321
00:23:07.331 --> 00:23:08.290
and as I say,

322
00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:13.620
probably would not have been without the phenomenon of the internal developments

323
00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.790
in Athens itself

324
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:21.370
came on also.
And his,

325
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:26.400
his control of Athenian Affairs by virtue of his personal standing and his

326
00:23:27.671 --> 00:23:30.730
persuasive abilities are also surprising.

327
00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:36.790
Marathon was a victory for hoplites.
It was the farmers,

328
00:23:36.791 --> 00:23:40.480
the middling group and those above them that won that battle.

329
00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:45.350
But Salomon us was a victory for the poor.
Inactives of course,

330
00:23:45.351 --> 00:23:50.351
that vast fleet was road by poor Athenians and now they had the glory for the,

331
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.400
for the victory.
And they,

332
00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:57.950
and every of course after the work,

333
00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:02.980
when the fleet became the basis of Athenian strength and glory,

334
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:08.470
it was the common man who was and the poorest of the Athenians who was involved

335
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.860
in achieving that,
uh,
desirable status.

336
00:24:12.861 --> 00:24:16.010
So you would have thought,

337
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:19.520
and if the mystical he's had been in control,
I'm sure you would have been right,

338
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:24.970
that there would be a movement towards greater democratization of the state.

339
00:24:25.521 --> 00:24:29.750
Remember where we are before the wars begin is Cli Stenek democracy,

340
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:35.200
which is pretty much a hoplite democracy and which excludes the poor from many

341
00:24:36.441 --> 00:24:40.970
of the activities of the state came on,
ran against that.

342
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.010
He basically,

343
00:24:43.011 --> 00:24:48.011
he never tried to unravel Athenian democracy is not an enemy of Athenian

344
00:24:48.231 --> 00:24:49.064
democracy.

345
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:54.070
He was in favor of keeping it the way it was and in some ways actually rolling

346
00:24:57.111 --> 00:25:00.200
back some degree of democracy.

347
00:25:00.201 --> 00:25:05.030
The way it was somewhat rolled back was that,

348
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.570
and not by any legal position or illegal action,

349
00:25:08.571 --> 00:25:12.980
but rather by sort of the way events went forward.

350
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:19.750
Aristotle in the Constitution of the Athenians describes the stretch of time,

351
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:23.330
uh,
that I'm talking about by four 79,

352
00:25:23.331 --> 00:25:28.331
four 62 as the period of the Areola gyrates constitution.

353
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.800
What that means is the old areas to credit council consisting of former top

354
00:25:37.161 --> 00:25:42.161
magistrates gained unofficial informal but very real power.

355
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:50.180
Scholars have had a hard time understanding exactly what it was.

356
00:25:50.181 --> 00:25:51.860
That was the nature of that power.

357
00:25:51.861 --> 00:25:56.690
But it looks as though a couple of elements with certainly there and there were

358
00:25:56.691 --> 00:26:00.500
very critical.
That is the area out because it was said,

359
00:26:00.501 --> 00:26:02.580
sort of regained the,

360
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:07.160
the oversight of magistrates.
They were,

361
00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:10.670
uh,
as in the,
in the Arab Socratic past,

362
00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:15.940
in the position of being able to have criticized magistrates and to take action

363
00:26:16.491 --> 00:26:21.491
against them if they acted in a way that the area abicus did not approve.

364
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:26.870
And it also seems very plausible that even though they're continued to be a

365
00:26:26.871 --> 00:26:28.340
council of 500,

366
00:26:28.341 --> 00:26:33.230
which was continuing to function as it had ever since the Cli Senate

367
00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:35.150
constitution had established it.

368
00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:40.600
The fact is that more and more the area bigass was taking decisions about

369
00:26:41.661 --> 00:26:43.790
foreign policy,
uh,

370
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:47.400
was putting to the assembly when they desired motions.

371
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:52.640
They were usurping some of the powers of the 500.

372
00:26:53.131 --> 00:26:57.600
They would not doing this as I keep saying by no chain,
by any change of the law,

373
00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:00.810
they were doing it because they thought they could.

374
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:04.680
And the people accepted it.
One reason for it,

375
00:27:04.681 --> 00:27:05.970
according to Aristotle,

376
00:27:05.971 --> 00:27:10.971
is that they had played a particularly heroic role in the Persian wars at the

377
00:27:12.841 --> 00:27:17.841
moment when the Persians invaded Attica and the Athenians were forced to flee

378
00:27:17.851 --> 00:27:18.684
their homes.

379
00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:24.080
And to go to sal amiss and to the Peloponnesus to escape for that moment.

380
00:27:24.721 --> 00:27:29.721
Now the poor had no wherewithal to keep themselves alive when they went into

381
00:27:30.211 --> 00:27:31.680
exile in this way.

382
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:37.100
And so the area opera giants use their own money to keep the poor alive and in

383
00:27:40.231 --> 00:27:42.600
good condition during that period of time.

384
00:27:42.601 --> 00:27:47.601
They volunteer that action and that generosity and patriotism and goodwill

385
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:55.550
allowed the development of this area [inaudible] constitution in the years that

386
00:27:56.401 --> 00:28:00.360
came.
And that's what came on,
I think really had in mind.

387
00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:05.390
He wanted to have this sort of dual policy of conservative,

388
00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:11.750
moderate democracy conservative in that it did not take any recognition of the

389
00:28:14.161 --> 00:28:19.161
changing circumstances that would have given the poor a better claim to

390
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:23.360
political power and also,
um,

391
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:28.400
conservative in the sense that it was not going to challenge the Doula did the

392
00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:33.480
dualism of Greek international relations as it had emerged from the Persian war.

393
00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.730
And that's the policy that Athens followed with tremendous success,

394
00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:40.920
um,

395
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.920
during the late career of Keeman while he was at the head of affairs.

396
00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:49.800
Remember,
I keep saying he's at the head of affairs and he's running things,

397
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:55.070
but remember he's just one of 10 generals who is elected every year.

398
00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.310
So all of his,
his info,
it's,
I,
yeah,
I was going to say is power,

399
00:28:59.311 --> 00:29:04.311
but it's be better to speak of his influence because it's all unofficial.

400
00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:09.510
He is able to have these things happen because people do what he urges them to

401
00:29:09.511 --> 00:29:12.090
do when they don't need to.

402
00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.520
There's no compulsion necessary.

403
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.710
He is the one who sets the tone and they follow him.
Uh,

404
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.840
centuries later when Augustus becomes the boss of the Roman world,

405
00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:25.753
um,

406
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:30.090
his own statement of the situation put the way he wanted people to think about

407
00:29:30.091 --> 00:29:35.091
it was that he was foremost not in power protest us is the Latin word,

408
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.950
but rather in terms of his,
his influence,

409
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:45.700
uh,
he wanted to say,
uh,
it was not a tyranny.

410
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.420
It was not a monarchy.
It was a republic,

411
00:29:49.421 --> 00:29:54.421
as it had always been an eye Augustus as the leading citizen in the eyes of my

412
00:29:56.831 --> 00:30:00.770
fellow Romans am able to persuade them,
uh,

413
00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:05.440
to do these things,
not because they have to be because they want to.
Well,

414
00:30:05.441 --> 00:30:10.060
that was his story and it wasn't true because he had a great big army at his

415
00:30:10.061 --> 00:30:12.280
back.
And if you wanted to move him out of anything,

416
00:30:12.281 --> 00:30:14.650
you would just have to get yourself killed.

417
00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.400
This was not the situation with chemo.
He came on,

418
00:30:18.401 --> 00:30:20.620
could have made that speech and it would have been true.

419
00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:27.070
So all that cruises along until we get to the,

420
00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.220
uh,
fasion rebellion came on,

421
00:30:30.221 --> 00:30:34.540
is in charge of that expedition.
And,
uh,

422
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:39.600
it proves to be a much tougher problem than any that he has had to face before

423
00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:43.330
the war extends for a long time.
There's no success there has,

424
00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:46.240
there's expense and no pay off.
And of course,

425
00:30:46.241 --> 00:30:51.241
there's some question as to the legitimacy and decency of what is going on here.

426
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:56.530
So I'm the enemies of Pericles.
I'm sorry,

427
00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.290
of Kmart.
In a moment I'll tell you about them.

428
00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:03.460
Take advantage of the discontent.

429
00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:08.470
That decision rebellion is causing to launch an attack on,

430
00:31:08.471 --> 00:31:12.430
came on politically for the first time in anybody's memory.

431
00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.680
The opponents,
the these,
uh,

432
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:19.420
enemies of chemo on are in the first instance,

433
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.910
a man calledF elts.

434
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:27.400
And very soon it becomes clear that he has as a kind of a lieutenant,
uh,

435
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:28.330
uh,

436
00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:32.980
a younger man who was a important but subordinate to Effie out these,

437
00:31:32.981 --> 00:31:36.340
that young man is Peric Lee's the son of sense.

438
00:31:36.341 --> 00:31:39.700
Ipus censorship is the great Persian war hero.

439
00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:46.020
We are told it's very hard to disentangle the effects from the stories here,

440
00:31:46.541 --> 00:31:49.330
but,
uh,
fel elts was opposed to a,

441
00:31:49.331 --> 00:31:54.331
have been associated with some mystical lees and that's very plausible because

442
00:31:54.371 --> 00:31:59.371
certainly fel these deserves to be thought of as a democratic leader with the

443
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.710
underlining of the Democrat.

444
00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:08.010
He is clearly attempting to make a change in the constitution and de facto at

445
00:32:09.341 --> 00:32:10.990
the very least,
uh,

446
00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:14.470
which would allow the navel crowd,

447
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:19.500
the poor people of Athens who row in the fleets to have more political power and

448
00:32:21.731 --> 00:32:22.600
opportunity.

449
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:27.900
And he is also very strongly anti spartan so that he is opposed to both halves

450
00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:37.530
of the key Monique one approach to things and he works at trying to undermine

451
00:32:38.081 --> 00:32:39.860
and to defeat came on.

452
00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:44.870
We had no luck at toll until say sauce and then they bring charges against,

453
00:32:44.871 --> 00:32:47.500
came on.
You know,
he hadn't done anything wrong.

454
00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:51.470
What we had done was not win the war very quickly,
but,
uh,
you know,

455
00:32:51.471 --> 00:32:54.440
you make up charges in the world of politics.
You,
you've heard of that.

456
00:32:54.441 --> 00:32:59.080
And once or twice and a e s B,

457
00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:00.910
they said,
well,
the reason,
uh,

458
00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:06.580
he hadn't won the war so quickly was because he had been bribe by the king of

459
00:33:07.521 --> 00:33:11.600
Macedonia,
which is right behind the territory.
We're talking about,
uh,

460
00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:14.630
not to conquer Macedonia.
Well,
guess what?

461
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:19.340
He wasn't under orders to conquer Macedonia.
He had no plan to conquer.
Macedonia,

462
00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.930
didn't need to be bribed,
not to,
uh,

463
00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:26.810
conquered Macedonia on top of which it was pretty,

464
00:33:26.811 --> 00:33:30.890
pretty hard to bribe Keeman because although he had started out poor from his

465
00:33:30.891 --> 00:33:31.610
father's death,

466
00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:36.610
he was now an enormously rich guy because of the booty which he had legitimately

467
00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.790
acquired in his role as commander of those expeditions.

468
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:42.170
Everybody knew who he was.

469
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:46.550
He was incredibly rich and he was very generous with his riches and gave it away

470
00:33:46.551 --> 00:33:50.150
in all sorts of ways.
Eh,
you know,
if you want to say that,
uh,
uh,

471
00:33:50.151 --> 00:33:53.390
Rockefeller is a no good low down polecat that's fine,

472
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:56.070
but if you want to say he's being bribed with money,

473
00:33:56.071 --> 00:33:59.360
all you're going to do is get laughter at is something like that.

474
00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:04.040
And in a sense and in some way that is the situation with Kimani.
Um,

475
00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:08.250
so,
um,
uh,
the uh,

476
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:12.450
trial is not nonetheless launched against Chemo on the,
uh,

477
00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:17.830
the complainants is paraclese this young up and coming democratic politician who

478
00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:24.440
makes the case against Chemo on,
he loses,
of course he loses it,

479
00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:28.430
came on,
has not lost his support.

480
00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:31.460
And the case is absurd.

481
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:36.350
It's just a sign that for the first time there's some kind of serious political

482
00:34:36.351 --> 00:34:39.380
opposition and who is involved in it.

483
00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:45.520
Even before that trial fel ds had tried another technique by attacking the area

484
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:51.280
opera Gus through a tax on particular area,
opera giants.

485
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:55.370
If you don't have any success in the general political arena,

486
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:59.930
one device that is as old as the hills and as new as yesterday is,

487
00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:04.931
you tried to discredit individuals in the regime that you're trying to unseat.

488
00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:10.490
And so various charges were brought against particular area.
The opera giants,

489
00:35:10.491 --> 00:35:14.340
they might've had merit,
they might not.
The goal was to discredit the area.

490
00:35:14.341 --> 00:35:16.880
[inaudible] as a whole,
again,

491
00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:20.810
did not succeed in the years that I am talking about.

492
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:23.600
These are just the signs of what we're talking about,

493
00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:29.980
which takes us to the years just after the,

494
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.640
uh,

495
00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:36.640
putting down of the fasion rebellion is enormous argument.

496
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:42.350
Scholars that never will go away about just what is the date of the terrible

497
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:47.220
earthquake that hit the Peloponnesus in whatever time.

498
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.910
The most common,
uh,

499
00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:54.810
opinion is that it was around four 64 and that's,

500
00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:56.340
that appeals to me too.

501
00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:02.450
And the earthquake was so serious as to disrupt life in Sparta and in Spartan

502
00:36:03.241 --> 00:36:04.590
territory in general,

503
00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:09.890
and thereby to encourage a great hell out rebellion so that the ladder,

504
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:14.520
even after the earthquake was over,

505
00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:18.210
was what occupied and terrified the Spartans.

506
00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:23.210
And it was serious enough that they sent out to their allies.

507
00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:28.380
And I'm not now talking merely about their allies in the Peloponnesian League,

508
00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:33.030
in their allies who had joined them in the Greek league against Persia,

509
00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:38.050
which was still on the books and asking them to send help against the hell

510
00:36:38.051 --> 00:36:40.560
[inaudible].
And a number of them did.

511
00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:45.480
And it's indicative of what the relationship between Athens and Sparta was that

512
00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:50.100
they also asked for help in Athens to athletes.

513
00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:56.120
There was a great debate in the Athenian Assembly as to what answer to give the

514
00:36:59.491 --> 00:37:03.420
Spartans in their request for help.
And,
um,

515
00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:08.520
came on of course,
made the case for doing so.
And in fact,

516
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:13.550
he proposed that the Athenians sent a very large force as these things go in the

517
00:37:13.981 --> 00:37:17.640
Greek world of 4,000 hoplites.

518
00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:19.380
That's a very big army.

519
00:37:19.381 --> 00:37:24.060
The Athenians very rarely send an army of that size outside of Athens,

520
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:29.070
uh,
into the Peloponnesus to help the Spartans against the hell odds.
Uh,

521
00:37:29.071 --> 00:37:33.840
he made the case that,
uh,
Athens should not,
uh,

522
00:37:33.841 --> 00:37:37.200
abandoned.
It's a former ally.
He,
uh,

523
00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:42.150
he spoken panhellenic terms using uh,
uh,
a nice folk expression.

524
00:37:42.151 --> 00:37:46.090
He said,
uh,
Greece should not,
uh,

525
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:50.070
allow,
uh,
this kind of a split.

526
00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:54.090
Athens should not lose its yoke fellow.

527
00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:58.530
And the image was a team of oxen drawing a plow.

528
00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:01.320
Athens and Sparta being that team.

529
00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:05.400
And so long as they're in the same yoke and doing the thing,

530
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:08.280
all will be well,
Greece will be safe.

531
00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:13.110
They will be no internal strife.
There'll be no war.
That's what we ought to do.

532
00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:18.990
Fel these spoke bitterly against that and,

533
00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:21.320
uh,
spoken terms of this,

534
00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:24.920
this story is all told in Plutarch's life of Cayman.

535
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:27.180
You want to have a look at that.
Uh,

536
00:38:27.181 --> 00:38:31.230
he seems to have evidence about what was said of this debate in the assembly.

537
00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:36.100
And if elts is boast to have said something like,
the,

538
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:41.050
the arrogance of Sparta must be trampled underfoot.

539
00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.650
Uh,
and he lost the argument,

540
00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.860
came on once again,
won the argument.

541
00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:53.220
Athens sends a force of these 4,000 hoplites down into the Peloponnesus.

542
00:38:53.861 --> 00:38:54.551
They were called on,

543
00:38:54.551 --> 00:38:59.090
especially Spartans wanted them because the hell out said runaway to mount if

544
00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:03.760
foamy in Miss Enia,
uh,
which was a four to five place on a mountain,

545
00:39:03.761 --> 00:39:06.730
very hard to,
uh,
uh,
attack.

546
00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:11.940
The Spartans had failed in their efforts to besiege or just storm the position

547
00:39:11.951 --> 00:39:12.730
there.

548
00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:17.710
And the Athenians had a reputation now of being very good at siege warfare,

549
00:39:17.711 --> 00:39:22.120
which they had gained at the end of the Persian wars.
You remember,
uh,

550
00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:23.190
[inaudible] said,

551
00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:27.810
a besieged and taken assessed us in a very effective way.
Well,

552
00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:30.250
the Athenians went and had a shot at it and fail,

553
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:36.510
at which point the Spartans were a little bit less keen on having them there.

554
00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:40.330
And then very soon after that,

555
00:39:40.331 --> 00:39:44.920
the Athenians went to the,
I'm sorry,
the Spartans went to the Athenians and said,

556
00:39:44.921 --> 00:39:47.590
thank you very much for your contribution.
Uh,

557
00:39:47.591 --> 00:39:50.410
we have no further need of your services.
Have a nice trip home.

558
00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:56.620
Instead of being very grateful and happy that they didn't have to fight anymore,

559
00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.540
the Athenians were insulted.

560
00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:03.970
None of the other allies was asked to leave.
None of the others were gone.

561
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:06.880
The Athenians are clearly had been sent away,

562
00:40:06.881 --> 00:40:10.570
not for out of friendly reasons.
Uh,

563
00:40:10.571 --> 00:40:13.060
and Susan that he's tells us what was on the mind,

564
00:40:13.061 --> 00:40:15.100
that the Spartans who made these decisions,

565
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:20.550
they had developed a fear of the Athenian soldiers who were in the Peloponnesus.

566
00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.890
They,
you know,
do you know,

567
00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:28.090
typically you don't Spartans don't get to see or know anybody else.

568
00:40:28.091 --> 00:40:32.050
The only time they ever get to see foreigners is with that and be fighting side

569
00:40:32.051 --> 00:40:33.130
by side briefly.

570
00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.090
But now you can imagine the scene where these ordinary,

571
00:40:37.091 --> 00:40:42.091
everyday Athenians having been born and raised in a democracy where there is

572
00:40:42.101 --> 00:40:45.320
absolute freedom and freedom of speech,
uh,

573
00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:50.400
and were there a style of life is not bad for a Greek by Greek standards.

574
00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:53.840
And you can imagine these,
uh,

575
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.940
inviting these Athenian soldiers in for a,

576
00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:02.380
for a meal and feeding them a spartan meal,

577
00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:07.440
black soup.
And the Athenians think

578
00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:12.010
that this is what you get the hell out,
right?
You're not going to eat that stuff,

579
00:41:12.011 --> 00:41:16.420
right?
You want us to eat that stuff?
I wouldn't feed it to a pig.

580
00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:20.620
I'm inventing the conversation.
But you've got the general idea.

581
00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:24.950
And the Spence couldn't have enjoyed that very much.
And then,
uh,

582
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.050
as they looked around and fence,
so what kind of estate this was in,

583
00:41:29.051 --> 00:41:33.070
which there were all these enslaved people.
He'd vast numbers,

584
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:37.700
enslaved people,
not the kind of slaves they knew about the ones who,
who,

585
00:41:37.701 --> 00:41:41.240
where you had a,
like a handyman over assisted you on the farm,

586
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:46.310
the vast numbers of them doing all the work while the Spartans didn't do any.

587
00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:47.240
Uh,

588
00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:51.770
and then they saw that the business was run by a small group of people at the

589
00:41:51.771 --> 00:41:56.240
average spartan soldier had nothing to say about what was going on.
Uh,

590
00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:00.560
and then being Athenians,
they no doubt,
said something about that.

591
00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:05.980
And so acidity says to Spartans became fearful that they would in fact help the

592
00:42:06.771 --> 00:42:11.771
hell odds in a rebellion against the Spartans.

593
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:14.090
And that in general,

594
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:19.120
he feared the Spartans feared there revolutionaries spirit.

595
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:23.810
And it was on that ground that they sent them away.
In any case,

596
00:42:23.811 --> 00:42:27.470
it was no doubt in the minds of the Athenians,
they had been sent away,

597
00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:31.400
not in an honorable way in which friends treat friends,

598
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:35.090
but they had been dismissed.
And when they came home,

599
00:42:35.091 --> 00:42:38.210
they were furious that they had gone in the first place,

600
00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:43.520
angry with Cayman for sending them.
And four of course,

601
00:42:43.521 --> 00:42:45.650
is pro sport and position in general.

602
00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:49.100
And in the spring of four 62,

603
00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:51.800
four 61 is it maybe,

604
00:42:51.801 --> 00:42:56.801
I think it's forced 61 they ostracized Kimani and off he went.

605
00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:03.970
That was the sort of the deadly stroke in what was now fairly,

606
00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:11.480
could fairly be called a political revolution in Athens.

607
00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:16.610
It was not brought about by force.
It was brought about in a constitutional way,

608
00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:22.120
but it nonetheless put an end to a whole stretch of time in which the state was

609
00:43:23.301 --> 00:43:28.150
run in a certain way and brought about new kinds of,
uh,

610
00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:33.830
uh,
an,
uh,
new,
uh,
new development,
let us say,

611
00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:37.520
a development towards a fuller democracy,

612
00:43:37.521 --> 00:43:42.521
but it's immediate consequences where a complete breach with Sparta,

613
00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:48.520
the Athenians renounced their old alliance made in the Hellenic League.

614
00:43:49.491 --> 00:43:53.060
And for 81,
uh,
that was over,

615
00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:58.900
they turned around and made alliances with Argos Sparta's bitter Peloponnesian

616
00:44:00.261 --> 00:44:04.220
enemies.
They made an alliance with the people in the north,

617
00:44:04.221 --> 00:44:07.760
the first aliens who were famous for their cavalry.

618
00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:13.420
And the implication of that being that the Athenians had warlike intentions

619
00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:17.420
against the Spartans signing up,
first of all,

620
00:44:17.421 --> 00:44:22.370
with their most famous local enemy and then signing up for the,

621
00:44:22.371 --> 00:44:26.630
uh,
opportunity to have a,
a cavalry to use as well.
And indeed,

622
00:44:26.631 --> 00:44:27.590
as we will see,

623
00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:32.620
it did leave very soon to a war between Athens and Sparta.

624
00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:38.250
And there are the two sets of allies in what modern historians call the first

625
00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:42.390
Peloponnesian war.
But before we get to that,

626
00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:47.420
I think we want to attend to the great changes in Athens internally that were

627
00:44:50.071 --> 00:44:52.530
brought about by this great revolution.

628
00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:56.850
I think first thing we need to do is to dispose of flts,

629
00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:02.600
which is what his enemies did almost immediately this he was murdered.

630
00:45:02.791 --> 00:45:07.140
Somebody came and stuck a knife in him.
Uh,
it's very interesting.

631
00:45:07.141 --> 00:45:12.141
This is the only political assassination that we know of in the entire history

632
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.230
of the Athenian democracy.

633
00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:21.900
And when you think of how few worthy methods for protecting anybody in the

634
00:45:24.061 --> 00:45:25.410
Athenian state,

635
00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:29.040
it really is a remarkable thing is sometimes I think when you look back at the

636
00:45:29.041 --> 00:45:34.041
history of the United States and the number of presidents who have either been

637
00:45:35.101 --> 00:45:38.580
killed or shot at,
uh,
attempts made to kill them,

638
00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:43.530
it's quite extraordinary that the Athenians,
this is the only case we know,

639
00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:48.570
nobody knows,
knows to this day who committed it.

640
00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:50.430
There were various rumors of which

641
00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:57.450
one is obviously inspired by political considerations and hard to believe,

642
00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:02.760
uh,
claims that [inaudible] killed them in order to clear the way for his own

643
00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:04.800
leadership of the Democratic faction.

644
00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:08.160
I don't think we need to take that seriously,
but that was one of the charges.

645
00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:13.490
More likely it was the murder was brought about by disgruntled chemoed,

646
00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:17.730
Ian's disgruntled conservatives,
disgruntled aristocrats,

647
00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:22.760
people who were very angry at the turn of events that had changed everything in

648
00:46:23.041 --> 00:46:28.040
Athens.
But if we look at the situation in Athens in four 60,
one 40,

649
00:46:28.041 --> 00:46:29.760
60,
and so on,
uh,

650
00:46:29.761 --> 00:46:34.761
we are seeing a movement towards a democratic,

651
00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:38.850
I don't want to say revolution,
I suppose,

652
00:46:38.851 --> 00:46:43.560
but a rapid movement to make the state,

653
00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:47.280
the city of Athens more democratic than it ever had been.

654
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.090
And,
uh,

655
00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:53.820
I'd like to turn next to the story of what that

656
00:46:55.370 --> 00:47:00.370
full blown Athenian democracy was like and how it worked.

657
00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:08.820
Let me just remind you that in the decade before 500,

658
00:47:08.821 --> 00:47:11.250
if we go back to the client centric world,

659
00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:15.510
the Greeks who lived in the city state called Athens,

660
00:47:15.511 --> 00:47:18.750
established a world's first democratic constitution.

661
00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:25.040
But this new kind of government was carried to it's classical stage by the

662
00:47:25.861 --> 00:47:30.861
reforms of [inaudible] a half a century in these years between 40 60 and four 50

663
00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:37.300
is really when most of the action took place.

664
00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.240
And it was in the Athens shaped by Perricone.

665
00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:46.250
Is that the greatest achievements of the Greek world to place?

666
00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:52.830
We should remember that the rest of the world continued to be characterized by

667
00:47:52.871 --> 00:47:57.871
monarchical rigidly hierarchical command societies while in democracy,

668
00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:01.301
while in Athens,

669
00:48:01.301 --> 00:48:06.301
democracy was carried as far as it would go before modern times.

670
00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:12.300
Perhaps if you look at it in a certain way further than any other place and

671
00:48:12.911 --> 00:48:17.880
time.
And I,
I'm going to start asking you to,

672
00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:18.853
to,
uh,

673
00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:24.920
be aware of your prejudices and to hold them lightly so that you can have the

674
00:48:24.961 --> 00:48:29.550
most full understanding of things that may have the same names.

675
00:48:29.551 --> 00:48:33.330
But really we're very different from things that we are accustomed to.

676
00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:38.520
For one thing,
it's worth pointing out right away was Athenian democracy.

677
00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:40.230
The act,

678
00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:45.260
the access to the political process was limited in Athens to adult males of

679
00:48:48.211 --> 00:48:53.020
native parentage
Athenian citizen.

680
00:48:53.021 --> 00:48:58.021
His ship granted full and active participation in every decision of the state

681
00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:05.980
without regard to the wealth or the class of the citizen.

682
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:09.770
And the four fifties under [inaudible] leadership,

683
00:49:09.771 --> 00:49:14.771
the Athenian Assembly passed a series of laws that went far towards establishing

684
00:49:15.681 --> 00:49:19.850
a constitution that was as thoroughly democratic as the world has ever seen.

685
00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:26.530
It gave direct and ultimate power to the citizens in the assembly and in the

686
00:49:27.501 --> 00:49:32.501
popular law courts where the people made all decisions by a simple majority vote

687
00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:41.980
and it provided for the selection of most public offices by allotment for the

688
00:49:43.611 --> 00:49:48.611
direct election of a very special few and for short terms of office and close

689
00:49:51.921 --> 00:49:55.850
control over all po public officials.

690
00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:01.610
We need to have a clear understanding of the kind of regime paraclese reforms

691
00:50:01.611 --> 00:50:02.960
produced for.

692
00:50:02.961 --> 00:50:07.430
I don't think it's easy for citizens of what are called democracies in the 20th

693
00:50:07.431 --> 00:50:07.881
century,

694
00:50:07.881 --> 00:50:12.881
21st century to comprehend the character of the democracy of ancient Athens and

695
00:50:13.761 --> 00:50:16.070
the role that it played in the life of its citizens.

696
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:19.220
To a degree that's hard for us to grasp.

697
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:25.030
Politics was primary in the ancient Greek city and the form of the constitution

698
00:50:26.811 --> 00:50:31.811
was and expected to shape the character of its citizens,

699
00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:37.100
the art,
the literature,
the philosophy,

700
00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:42.610
and all the great achievements of [inaudible] Athens cannot be fully understood

701
00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:47.660
apart from their political and constitutional context into democracy established

702
00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:52.460
by Christ in these and then extended by paraclese later.

703
00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:58.600
I think the place to start with a description of the Athenian democracy is with

704
00:50:59.121 --> 00:51:04.121
some attempt at a definition of the term developments in the modern world make

705
00:51:05.001 --> 00:51:10.001
that really hard for the word has become debased and is almost meaningless.

706
00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:15.560
Few modern states will admit to being anything but democratic.

707
00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:20.150
That is confusing enough,
but there are further complications.

708
00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:25.040
Many people today would insist that to qualify as a democracy,

709
00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:30.170
a state must offer a full constitutional and political protections and

710
00:51:30.171 --> 00:51:35.171
opportunities to all who have legal permanent residents within its borders and

711
00:51:36.831 --> 00:51:38.540
who desire citizenship.

712
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:44.300
But the Athenians limited the right to vote,

713
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:47.780
to hold office,
to serve on juries,

714
00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:52.910
to adult males who were citizens,
slaves,

715
00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:55.160
resident aliens,

716
00:51:55.580 --> 00:52:00.580
women and male citizens under the age of 20 were denied.

717
00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:02.690
All these privileges,

718
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:08.510
modern critics of ancient Athens question the democratic character of the Para

719
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:13.510
Cleon regime because of the presence of slavery and the exclusion of women from

720
00:52:13.881 --> 00:52:18.050
political life in excluding such groups,

721
00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:23.200
the Athenians were like every other society since the invention of civilization,

722
00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:29.060
about 3000 BC until just recently.

723
00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:35.200
So it's really not too interesting or amazing to point out this a shortcoming

724
00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:36.950
from our point of view,

725
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:42.110
what sets the Athenians apart on not these exclusions,

726
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:46.220
but the unusually large degree of inclusion,

727
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:52.150
as well as the extraordinarily significant and rewarding participation of those

728
00:52:52.791 --> 00:52:53.624
who were included.

729
00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:59.240
It's useful to remember that what has been called the Jacksonian democracy in

730
00:52:59.241 --> 00:53:04.241
the United States coexisted with slavery in the its fullest moments that women

731
00:53:07.071 --> 00:53:12.071
were everywhere denied the right to vote until the 20th century and that we

732
00:53:13.131 --> 00:53:18.131
continue to limit political participation to those of a specified age

733
00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:25.620
to deny the title of democracy to Perricone in Athens because of those excluded

734
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:30.950
would be to employ a parochial and anachronistic set of criteria that produce

735
00:53:32.011 --> 00:53:33.360
paradoxical results.

736
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:38.630
Certainly no contemporary Greek doubted that Athens was a democracy.

737
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:44.730
The only argument was whether a democracy was good or bad,

738
00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:48.780
which is it almost an unthinkable question to put in our own time

739
00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:51.660
to look at it from the other end.

740
00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:57.020
The Athenians would have been astonished at the claim of modern states to that

741
00:53:57.391 --> 00:54:00.900
title,
even such states as the United States and Great Britain.

742
00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:02.400
For to them,

743
00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:07.460
an essential feature of democracy was the direct and full sovereignty of the

744
00:54:08.911 --> 00:54:10.860
majority of citizens,

745
00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:16.500
government by elected representatives,
checks and balances,

746
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:20.940
separation of powers appointment,

747
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:22.710
two important offices,

748
00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:28.680
unelected bureaucracies,
judicial life,

749
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:33.710
tenure terms for elective office have more than one year.

750
00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:40.160
All of these would have seemed clear and deadly enemies of what reasonable

751
00:54:40.261 --> 00:54:42.990
people might understand by democracy.

752
00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:49.310
So these differences between ancient and modern ideas require a brief

753
00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:54.920
examination of how the Athenian Democracy worked if we are to shed our

754
00:54:55.381 --> 00:55:00.381
prejudices and grasped the character of a form of government that is as rare as

755
00:55:00.571 --> 00:55:02.190
any in the history of the world.

756
00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:07.910
And that probably never existed in anything like the same form after the end of,

757
00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:10.530
uh,
Athenian autonomy.

758
00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:17.060
So I like to use a helpful if anachronistic advice by considering the three

759
00:55:17.911 --> 00:55:22.890
familiar branches into which we divide government,
legislative,
executive,

760
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:23.783
and judiciary.

761
00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:29.610
At the heart of what we would call the legislative branch of the Athenian

762
00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:33.270
Democracy was the assembly there were,
it was a clay sia.

763
00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:38.760
It was open to all the adult male citizens of Athens during [inaudible]

764
00:55:38.761 --> 00:55:43.080
lifetime.
These may have been 40,000,

765
00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:46.020
possibly as many as 50,000 men.

766
00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:50.970
And now most Athenians lived many miles from the city,

767
00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:53.490
few owned horses.

768
00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:57.540
So attendance required a very long walk to town.

769
00:55:58.410 --> 00:55:59.550
So as a result,

770
00:55:59.551 --> 00:56:04.170
the number of taking part normally was well short of that,

771
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:09.230
it was probably from five to 6,000 people.

772
00:56:10.770 --> 00:56:15.770
One reason for saying that is that there was a quorum for some actions that you

773
00:56:16.291 --> 00:56:20.220
had to have at least 6,000 votes.
On the one hand that tells us,

774
00:56:20.221 --> 00:56:24.160
I think that there were,
uh,
probably more than that,

775
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:27.850
who attended the assembly.
You wouldn't make a core and being everybody,

776
00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:30.670
whoever attended the place.
But on the other hand,

777
00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:35.320
it suggests that there were many assemblies with fewer than 6,000 votes.

778
00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:41.560
The meetings took place outside on a hill called the panics,

779
00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:47.640
not far from the Acropolis and overlooking the Agora citizens sat on the earth

780
00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:52.090
of this sharply sloping hill,

781
00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:55.720
and the speakers stood on a low platform.

782
00:56:56.940 --> 00:57:00.220
It was not easy for them to make themselves heard.

783
00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:05.050
You can imagine it's an outdoor place.
They don't have microphones.

784
00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:09.760
The great fourth century orators are set to have practice.

785
00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:11.920
Well Demosthenes,
he's the greatest of them,

786
00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:17.130
is said to have practiced speaking at the seashore over the crashing surf to

787
00:57:18.131 --> 00:57:21.970
make his voice strong enough to be heard on the [inaudible].

788
00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:27.330
A good loud voice was really a terrific asset for an Athenian politician.

789
00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:33.790
We've got some idea of the opening of these meetings from a comic version that

790
00:57:33.791 --> 00:57:38.791
is given to us in Aristophanes comedy at Carney ens performed in the year for 25

791
00:57:40.310 --> 00:57:45.310
the speaker is a typical Aristo fannick comic hero and old fashion farmer from

792
00:57:46.661 --> 00:57:49.600
the backwoods who complains about the war.

793
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:53.710
War is now about six years old because it keeps him in Athens,

794
00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.620
away from his farm in the country.

795
00:57:56.860 --> 00:58:00.010
I quote now from the Irish Stefanik passage,

796
00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:04.900
it is the day of an assembly.
He says he's a,
by the way,

797
00:58:04.901 --> 00:58:07.750
he's sitting there all by himself on the panics.

798
00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:11.200
Nobody has come yet and there he is complaining.

799
00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:16.120
It is that Dave and assembly and already morning,
but the Pernix is deserted.

800
00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:21.540
They are chattering in the Agora dodging the rope dripping with red dye.

801
00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:26.020
That's a reference to the fact that the Athenians are always slow to come from

802
00:58:26.021 --> 00:58:28.840
the marketplace,
the Agora,
the city center,

803
00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:32.950
and make it up the hill to the [inaudible] because they were so busy talking

804
00:58:32.951 --> 00:58:36.430
that they just wouldn't get going.
So the,
the,
uh,

805
00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:39.910
officials had some guy's carrying a rope dipped in red dye.

806
00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:44.970
They circled the Agora and they kept closing the circle until uh,

807
00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:46.090
everybody was out.

808
00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:49.390
You would be running away from them in the first place because you wouldn't want

809
00:58:49.391 --> 00:58:53.010
to get your coat full of red dye.
And so that's,

810
00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:54.580
that's what he's referring to.

811
00:58:55.830 --> 00:59:00.130
You said even the presidents of the assembly have not arrived.
They will be late.

812
00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:01.630
And when they finally come,

813
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:05.920
they will push and fight each other for a seat in the front row,

814
00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:09.130
streaming down all together.
You can't imagine how,

815
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:12.850
but they will say nothing about making peace.

816
00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:15.400
Oh my Athens.

817
00:59:15.790 --> 00:59:20.260
I am always the first to make the return voyage to the assembly and take my
seat.

818
00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:25.610
And since I am alone,
I groan.
I yawn,

819
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:31.340
I stretch my legs,
I fart.
I don't know what to do.

820
00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:37.100
I write,
I pull out my loose hairs,
I add up my accounts,

821
00:59:37.101 --> 00:59:40.520
looking off at my fields,
longing for peace,

822
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:44.480
hating the town,
sick for my village home,

823
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:48.680
which never said by my charcoal,
my vinegar,
my oil,

824
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:52.160
the word by his unknown there where everything is free.

825
00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:57.020
And so I have come here fully prepared to shout,

826
00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:58.070
to interrupt,

827
00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:02.180
to abuse the speakers if they talk about anything but peace.

828
01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:06.920
But here come these noon time presidents,
didn't I tell you,

829
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:10.000
didn't I predict they would?
How they would come?
Everyone.

830
01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:14.170
Jocelyn up to the front seat.
Next,

831
01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:18.200
the herald of the assembly says move up,

832
01:00:18.201 --> 01:00:20.090
move up within the consecrated area.

833
01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:25.130
And then he recites the formula that regularly begins debate in the assembly.

834
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:30.190
He simply says who wishes to speak at which somebody raises a hand.

835
01:00:31.641 --> 01:00:35.480
Then the game gets started.
Okay,
that's the comic version.

836
01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:38.720
But the real meetings on the picnics were rarely comic.

837
01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.900
They dealt with serious questions.

838
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:46.640
You Assembly had four fixed meetings,
uh,

839
01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:51.790
in each of the 10 periods into which the official year was divided and also

840
01:00:51.951 --> 01:00:54.620
special.
Additional meetings were cold flow when necessary.

841
01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:59.780
Topics included the approval or disapproval of treaties,

842
01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:04.880
making declarations of war,
assigning generals to campaigns,

843
01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:08.330
deciding what forces and resources they should command,

844
01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:12.320
confirming officials or removing them from office,

845
01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:15.680
deciding whether or not to hold an ostracism.

846
01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:20.360
Questions concerning religion,
questions of inheritance,

847
01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:21.800
in fact,

848
01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:25.700
anything else that anybody wanted to bring up in the assembly.

849
01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:31.550
It's especially amazing for a citizen of a modern representative democracy to

850
01:01:31.551 --> 01:01:36.140
read of these great town meetings dealing directly with questions of foreign

851
01:01:36.141 --> 01:01:41.141
policy that could mean life or death for those present at the debate and for

852
01:01:41.331 --> 01:01:42.290
their entire city.

853
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:46.700
To get some idea of the distance between ancient and modern democracy,

854
01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:52.060
we need only to consider how an emergency say the seizure of an American embassy

855
01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:55.430
would be dealt with today in the United States.

856
01:01:55.780 --> 01:02:00.780
It would probably have arrived first as secret information at some bureau of the

857
01:02:01.191 --> 01:02:04.580
government's vast and complex complex intelligence service.

858
01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:09.530
Although it could also just show up on CNN for the before the government knows,

859
01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:15.380
but it would be treated as highly confidential and revealed only to a few people

860
01:02:15.381 --> 01:02:18.290
in the White House.
The state and defense departments

861
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:25.010
policy would be discussed in a small close group and the decision made by one

862
01:02:25.171 --> 01:02:29.970
man,
ultimately the president of the United States.
And if there were no leaks,

863
01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:35.780
I big if people would hear if it only when the die had been cast and model for

864
01:02:37.021 --> 01:02:40.980
this,
those of my vintage where was the Cuban missile crisis,

865
01:02:41.310 --> 01:02:43.500
which was kept as a great secret.
In those days,

866
01:02:43.501 --> 01:02:48.120
the press actually would keep secrets in behalf of the national security.

867
01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:52.920
He imagines such an old fashioned approach.
Uh,
but uh,

868
01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:57.510
and then they had been kicking it around for a week when the president got on

869
01:02:57.511 --> 01:03:02.040
television and told us what the menace was and what he was doing about it.

870
01:03:02.290 --> 01:03:04.710
It was too late to have any discussion or argument about it.

871
01:03:04.711 --> 01:03:06.690
But that's the way it works in our system.

872
01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:12.150
Questions of war and peace rose more than once in perfectly in Athens.

873
01:03:12.151 --> 01:03:17.151
And each time the popular assembly had a full debate and made the decision by

874
01:03:18.481 --> 01:03:22.620
raising their hands in a vote determined by a simple majority.

875
01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:28.400
I don't think there's any stronger evidence of the full and final sovereignty of

876
01:03:28.501 --> 01:03:31.530
the Athenian people on the most important questions.

877
01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:36.260
Then that fact that that is the way they made those decisions and assembly of

878
01:03:36.261 --> 01:03:41.190
thousands of course could not do its business without help.
For that,

879
01:03:41.191 --> 01:03:46.191
it relied on the council of 500 chosen by lot from all Athenian citizens.

880
01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:51.570
Although it performed many public functions that the larger body could not

881
01:03:51.571 --> 01:03:52.800
handle efficiently.

882
01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:58.310
It's main responsibility was to prepare legislation for consideration by the

883
01:03:59.071 --> 01:04:02.670
people in this respect.
As in all others,

884
01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:05.970
the council was the servant of the assembly.

885
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:10.710
The assembly could vote down a bill drafted by the council.

886
01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:14.370
They could change it on the floor,
they could send it back,
for instance,

887
01:04:14.490 --> 01:04:19.490
with instructions for re drafting or they could replace it with an entirely

888
01:04:19.831 --> 01:04:20.664
different bill.

889
01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:26.060
Full sovereignty and the real exercise of Public Authority rested directly with

890
01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:32.250
the assembly.
Almost no constitutional barrier prevented.

891
01:04:32.251 --> 01:04:37.251
A majority of the citizens assembled on the picnics on a particular day from

892
01:04:37.981 --> 01:04:40.650
doing anything they wanted to do.

893
01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:46.080
Turning to the executive and what we would call the executive.

894
01:04:46.081 --> 01:04:48.540
These distinctions did not exist for the Athenians.

895
01:04:48.541 --> 01:04:52.860
They didn't make these divisions but to help us understand that I'm using these

896
01:04:52.861 --> 01:04:55.050
terms but we might call.

897
01:04:55.051 --> 01:05:00.051
The executive was severely limited in extent in discretion and power and the

898
01:05:01.261 --> 01:05:06.261
distinction between legislative and judicial authority was far less clear than

899
01:05:06.991 --> 01:05:11.190
in our own society to begin with.
There was no precedent,

900
01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:13.710
no prime minister,
no cabinet.

901
01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:19.400
There was not any elected official for the management of the state in general

902
01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:24.160
for formulating or proposing a general policy.

903
01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:29.140
Nothing that Americans would call an administration or that the British would

904
01:05:29.141 --> 01:05:29.974
call a government.

905
01:05:30.850 --> 01:05:35.850
The chief elected officials were 10 generals voted for a one year term as their

906
01:05:37.421 --> 01:05:38.830
title indicated.

907
01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:42.910
They were basically military officials who commanded the army and the navy.

908
01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:48.480
They could be reelected without limit and extraordinary men like Kimani and

909
01:05:48.641 --> 01:05:51.580
Paraclese were elected almost every year,

910
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.810
but they were very exceptional.
The political power,

911
01:05:55.840 --> 01:06:00.840
such men exercise was limited to their personal ability to persuade their fellow

912
01:06:01.631 --> 01:06:04.750
citizens in the assembly to follow their advice.

913
01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:10.360
They had no special political or civil authority and accept on military and

914
01:06:10.361 --> 01:06:12.970
naval campaigns.
They couldn't give orders to anybody.

915
01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:18.820
Even in military matters.
The powers of the generals were severely limited.

916
01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:25.140
Leaders of expeditions was selected by vote of the full Athenian Assembly,

917
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:31.710
which also determined the size of the force and what goals it should pursue.

918
01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:35.470
Before the generals took office,

919
01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:40.530
they were subjected to a scrutiny of their qualifications by the council of 500

920
01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:43.810
after completing their year of service,

921
01:06:44.050 --> 01:06:48.580
their performance on the job and especially their financial accounts,

922
01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:53.670
we're subject to audit in a special process called a youth tuna.

923
01:06:54.590 --> 01:06:59.230
No.
Was this the only control by the people over the few officials chosen by

924
01:06:59.231 --> 01:07:02.440
election 10 times a year,

925
01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:07.480
the popular assembly voted to determine whether the generals conduct of military

926
01:07:07.481 --> 01:07:12.481
affairs appears satisfactory and if the people vote against someone's

927
01:07:13.871 --> 01:07:17.140
confirmation in office,
he is tried in a law court.

928
01:07:17.890 --> 01:07:21.490
If he is found guilty,
they assess his punishment or fine.

929
01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:24.550
If he is acquitted,
he resumed his office.

930
01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:28.090
Since elected office conferred prestige,

931
01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:33.360
elected officials were carefully confirmed a control rather less.

932
01:07:33.761 --> 01:07:38.050
They should undermine the rule of the people.
That's what's behind all of this.

933
01:07:38.051 --> 01:07:40.120
Careful check on the generals.

934
01:07:41.530 --> 01:07:44.350
Even with these severe controls,

935
01:07:44.351 --> 01:07:49.351
the Athenians fulfilled only a few public officer's by election choosing their

936
01:07:49.871 --> 01:07:51.670
military officials there,

937
01:07:51.671 --> 01:07:56.671
naval architects and only some of their treasurers as well as the superintendent

938
01:07:57.461 --> 01:08:00.310
of the city water supply in that manner.

939
01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:06.060
All other officials and there were a good number of them were chosen by lot

940
01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:07.961
allotment,

941
01:08:07.961 --> 01:08:12.961
was the characteristic device by which the Athenians chose their officials in

942
01:08:13.001 --> 01:08:17.870
accordance with the dominant democratic principle,
which was equality,

943
01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:23.240
which held that any citizen who was capable of performing civil responsibilities

944
01:08:23.241 --> 01:08:25.730
well enough and its corollary,

945
01:08:25.731 --> 01:08:30.290
that feared allowing executive or administrative power to fall into the hands of

946
01:08:30.291 --> 01:08:31.124
a few men,

947
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:36.430
even those who were experienced or had special abilities for these reasons,

948
01:08:37.131 --> 01:08:38.690
the Athenians fill,
uh,

949
01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:43.460
fill the bulk of their offices by lot and limited tenure to one,

950
01:08:44.170 --> 01:08:44.630
uh,

951
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:49.630
term per man in each office except for the council of 500,

952
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.990
where a man could serve twice in the course of his life.

953
01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:55.950
Generals,
however,

954
01:08:55.951 --> 01:09:00.951
it could be reelected forever because it was so obvious that issues of skill and

955
01:09:02.391 --> 01:09:05.270
ability where literally vital in that job.

956
01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:10.070
And so that was the one real exception to being limited to a very short term,

957
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.880
to a degree that is amazing to the modern mind.

958
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:19.460
The Athenians kept the management of their public life in the hands of ordinary

959
01:09:19.461 --> 01:09:23.960
citizens,
away from professors,
professionals,

960
01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:28.670
experts,
bureaucrats,
and politicians.

961
01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:32.330
I'll pick up the rest of the story next time.
