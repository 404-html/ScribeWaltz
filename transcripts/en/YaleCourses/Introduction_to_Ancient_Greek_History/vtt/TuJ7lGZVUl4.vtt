1
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.400
Before I start on the today's topic,
which is a Greek tyranny.

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.250
I have been asked to say a word on the subject.
Well,

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.460
to answer the question really the best I can.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.900
If the hoplite Phalanx was so stunningly successful in the period of the fifth,

5
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:24.630
sixth,
fifth,
fourth centuries BC,

6
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.220
why was it that other people's,
other than the Greeks,

7
00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:33.000
the ones who came in contact with them and saw it and were victimized by it,

8
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.650
why didn't they adopted?
Well,
let me make it perfectly clear,

9
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:40.920
like all other,
all the other interesting questions in this course.

10
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.040
I cannot give you a firm answer.

11
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.030
I can only give you a opinions and it,

12
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.060
but that whole subject now is so wonderfully more controversial than it was,

13
00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:55.950
uh,
probably ever before in history.

14
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.430
Because everything now in history that bears on the Western world and its

15
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:10.011
relations with some other world is part of a great political assault by those

16
00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:17.391
people who are eager to pull down anything that seems to be admirable or special

17
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:23.310
or positive about the west and either to say,
um,

18
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.580
it really was bad or to say it wasn't so terrific or it didn't exist.

19
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.700
Uh,
so that's the context in which,
not the student's question,
but the,

20
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.040
the larger question is getting kicked around these days.
Well,

21
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.910
I think part of the reason for unhappiness about it is that I think the answer

22
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.260
lies in the character precisely of the Polis.

23
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.490
The fact that it had,
uh,
an ethos,

24
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.240
a set of values which placed so powerfully at the center of the minds of the

25
00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:01.381
citizens.

26
00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:06.381
The notion that the combination of courage in a military setting,

27
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.400
which was the inheritance from homer and the new ideology of devotion to the

28
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:22.821
Polis as the most important kind of commitment that a citizen could have

29
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.410
produced a an attitude which was that it was the job of a man who was a citizen

30
00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:37.881
of a Polis beyond anything else to fight bravely in the ranks of his army.

31
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.900
And as it happened that they developed,

32
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.500
I think this latter part of the story is simply accidental.
They di,

33
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.530
they happen to develop this technique which employed the weapons and defensive

34
00:02:54.691 --> 00:02:59.220
armor that they had.
And then because they had those things,

35
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.260
and because this ethos was present,

36
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.060
it was possible to put together this fighting unit,

37
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.230
which was the Phalanx which depended so enormously,

38
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:16.231
heavily upon the commitment to the commonality to the common cause that was

39
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:23.320
characteristic of the Polis.
Now,
every state of every kind,
every people,

40
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:24.154
every tribe,

41
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.250
they have some degree of this kind of commitment to one another or else they

42
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:31.660
wouldn't exist as a unit.

43
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.810
But there are really very sharp differences of degree in terms of how powerfully

44
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.720
this commitment really affects people.
Uh,

45
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.520
you might even find that in the set you would find in the same people at

46
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:50.260
different times in their history.

47
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.890
The power of this idea and this commitment and it's so beyond an idea somehow

48
00:03:55.901 --> 00:04:00.901
it's sort of really bred and trained into the bones of every Greek man in the

49
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:03.350
Polis beginning sometime,

50
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.370
I would say in the seventh century or earlier and carrying forward so long as

51
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:12.550
the Polis remained an autonomous and independent unit.

52
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.470
So if you looked at it,

53
00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.420
weeks against Persians is the best case we have because the Greeks,

54
00:04:19.421 --> 00:04:24.280
what the Persians more than they fought other non-Greek peoples and the Persians

55
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:25.600
were very formidable.

56
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.900
Let's remember the Persians had defeated every other power there was in the

57
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:33.580
world that they knew and,
and uh,

58
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.790
controlled and dominated a vast,

59
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:39.070
vast empire by anybody's standards.

60
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.370
But certainly by the standards of the world in which they knew.

61
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.150
So for the Greeks to defeat the Persians,

62
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.890
there was nothing routine about that that was always going to be surprising and

63
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.120
needing explanation.

64
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.980
So really a way to focus the question that I'm addressing is how come the

65
00:04:56.981 --> 00:05:00.670
Persians didn't do it?
And there I think then that case,

66
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:05.671
the answer was not so very hard because the Persian empire was a composite unit

67
00:05:06.581 --> 00:05:11.581
made up of lots of places and vast numbers of people who had been conquered by

68
00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:17.491
the Persians and whose relationship to the great king of Persia was really in

69
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.050
almost technical sense that of slaves they needed to do.
They had to do,

70
00:05:23.051 --> 00:05:27.910
they were expected to do whatever the Persian king told him to do.
Now,

71
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:31.300
he was not a fanatical and,
and he,

72
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.320
he did not make requests that typically were impossible for people to do.

73
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.540
Uh,
in fact,
his,
the Persian rule over there,

74
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.980
a conquered peoples was in many ways easier and more generous and less intrusive

75
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.040
than other people's.
Uh,
for instance,
in the realm of religion,

76
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.810
the Persians did not bother,
didn't interfere with people's exercise of religion.

77
00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.150
Those of you who have read a book called the Old Testament,

78
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.360
will remember that,
uh,

79
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.280
the person show up at important places and they get treated very nicely.

80
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.080
Uh,
there are,
there's a bad Persian or two here or there,
but he gets put down.
Uh,

81
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:16.580
but the Persians treat and the Persians were among the people who treated the

82
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:20.150
Jews very well because they didn't care what the Persian,

83
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.970
what the Jews did in their religious life.

84
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.100
So long as they did the two important and essential things as the Persians

85
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.591
required,

86
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:32.591
which was you had to do military service for the king at his demand and you had

87
00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:37.740
to pay taxes.
If you did those things and made no trouble.
That's all.

88
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.310
That's all you had to worry about from the Persians.
Well,
okay,

89
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.430
why didn't the Persians then adopted pop?

90
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:46.370
Because the greater part of their army wasn't Persian.
Even.

91
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.720
So the kinds of,
uh,

92
00:06:48.721 --> 00:06:53.721
allegiance that's necessary for this kind of fighting wasn't motivated by most

93
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:55.364
of these people.

94
00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.670
A second reason was the Persians themselves and their Arion ally's the Medes had

95
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:08.140
achieved their success militarily as cavalryman.

96
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:10.820
And that was their nature.

97
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:16.180
And that was what they practiced an elevated to the highest levels so that the

98
00:07:16.611 --> 00:07:19.250
best Persians fought in the cavalry.

99
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.420
They had infantry and some of their infantry was relatively very good,

100
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.040
but there wasn't that kind of all that matters in a polls.
Basically,

101
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:32.690
I'm exaggerating,
only very slightly is how you fight in the infantry.

102
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.700
And it happily,

103
00:07:34.701 --> 00:07:38.570
that question isn't so bad because when we get to the story of the Spartans,

104
00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:41.870
which comes after our story of the tyrants,

105
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:47.350
I will read to you some of the poetry which was the material with which Spartans

106
00:07:47.991 --> 00:07:51.930
were trained.
And you'll quickly see why,
uh,

107
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:57.020
the Greek ethos,
the Greek feeling of absolute commitment,

108
00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.690
voluntary,
absolute commitment,

109
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.720
even at the risk of your life for the Polis was the central most important force

110
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:06.861
in society.

111
00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:11.861
So the answer is essentially a moral commitment based upon training.

112
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:17.330
And a belief is why the Greeks did the,
uh,

113
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:22.010
fail and plus the historical accident of there.
Having developed that technique,

114
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.850
it should be pointed out that there were peoples in the ancient near east before

115
00:08:25.851 --> 00:08:30.851
the Greeks ever came to be anything who had closely ordered a armed infantry

116
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:38.510
soldiers.
The Assyrians are a very good example.

117
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.000
But if you examine a Syrian fighting,

118
00:08:41.001 --> 00:08:45.650
it's not quite the same thing as the Greek fighting.
Uh,

119
00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:49.610
and if I knew more about a Syrian fighting,
I might be able to say still more.

120
00:08:49.611 --> 00:08:52.550
I don't know how much is actually known in detail,

121
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.990
but there was obviously an element in the story which went beyond merely

122
00:08:57.991 --> 00:09:01.980
equipment and order and so on.
It had to do with what was in their heads.

123
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:06.630
And I think,
you know,
if you know about warfare in the modern world,

124
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.580
even right today,

125
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:14.300
so much of how of what determines whether armies succeed or fail in their

126
00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:17.100
missions has to do with what's in their head.

127
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:22.060
Every army I think let's,
let's say every good army even,
um,

128
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.920
is good at certain things and they are trained and their culture prepares them

129
00:09:28.321 --> 00:09:31.800
if they are successful to do certain kinds of things,

130
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:37.010
if you take them and make them fight in a different way until they are able to

131
00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:39.180
make an adjustment,
which is sometimes never,

132
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.270
they can't fight with that same skill.

133
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.070
And so there was a very close union I would say,

134
00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:50.770
and I'll come back at home with to say a smarter guy than I said it long ago.
Um,

135
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:51.840
does it,

136
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.490
there's some close connection between the nature of the society that produces

137
00:09:56.491 --> 00:10:01.491
and uses the military force and the kind of fighting that military force can do.

138
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:03.720
Uh,

139
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.720
I'm really just giving you a little riff on a tune written by Aristotle back in

140
00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:13.080
his day when he connects closely the character,

141
00:10:13.081 --> 00:10:14.370
I think I mentioned that the other day,

142
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.670
the character of a regime and the character of the fighting,

143
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:22.740
I did tell you about that.
You know,
if it's going to be a cavalry based,

144
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:27.830
it's going to be ours to cratic or oligarchic if it's going to be a naval base

145
00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:30.420
is going to be democratic and so on and so forth.

146
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.930
So I hope that's of some help in dealing with that question.

147
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.410
Let's turn out precisely to this phenomenon,

148
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.080
which is Greek tyranny.

149
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:49.150
Tyranny emerges in the seventh century.
BC may be,

150
00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.860
it might've,
no,
I think not anything before that.

151
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.510
And it,
uh,
it emerges,

152
00:10:56.511 --> 00:10:59.870
I would think for many of the same reasons.

153
00:10:59.871 --> 00:11:04.190
And in response to some of the very same developments that I described for you

154
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.660
and talking about the great burst of colonization that began in the eighth

155
00:11:08.661 --> 00:11:12.770
century in the Greek world,
all of those tumultuous,

156
00:11:12.771 --> 00:11:17.771
troubling changing forces that were at work in society where we're at work and

157
00:11:18.351 --> 00:11:22.130
bringing about this new kind of regime,

158
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:26.840
which lasted from one to three generations,

159
00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.080
uh,
among the Greeks before it faded away.

160
00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:35.140
It was a transitional phase in Greek society rather than one that lasted for a

161
00:11:37.491 --> 00:11:41.750
terribly long time,
but it was not a trivial.
And then as I say,

162
00:11:41.751 --> 00:11:46.250
in some cases it went for three generations.
Okay.

163
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:51.230
What is tyranny?
Let's begin with the word the word tea run.
Neha is tyranny.

164
00:11:51.231 --> 00:11:56.231
The word Tiran nos is tiring and etymologically that the word does is not a

165
00:11:58.481 --> 00:11:59.590
Greek word.

166
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:05.850
It was a borrowed word that the Greeks took from somebody else and then applied

167
00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:09.520
it to a certain elements that emerged in their society.

168
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:14.290
Chances are it was borrowed from Lydia that uh,

169
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:19.350
kingdom in Asia minor that was inland from the Greek settlements on the coast.

170
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:25.660
And the first Lydian king of whom we here,

171
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:26.290
uh,

172
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:31.290
that could fit as the first tyrant from Greek perspective was a man called guide

173
00:12:33.101 --> 00:12:38.101
gs Gyg ges who ruled in Lydia per something like the years six 85,

174
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.610
two six 57,
something like that.

175
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:48.780
The first time the word tear on us or some version of it appears in Greek that

176
00:12:50.051 --> 00:12:52.240
we have comes in,

177
00:12:52.241 --> 00:12:57.241
the fragments of the poet are killing us.

178
00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:58.930
And uh,

179
00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:04.080
he is a fascinating character and we do have fortunately a few nice fragments of

180
00:13:05.861 --> 00:13:08.200
his poetry.
In fact,

181
00:13:08.201 --> 00:13:10.900
for the first time in the last couple of decades,

182
00:13:10.901 --> 00:13:13.090
for the first time since they were lost,

183
00:13:13.091 --> 00:13:17.770
we actually have a full lyric poem by,
uh,

184
00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.200
our killer kiss.
But in any case,

185
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:25.090
he has this bit of poetry that is preserved in a late writers,

186
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.460
a collection which says,

187
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:32.680
I don't care for the wealth of golden guide.
Geez.

188
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:34.990
Nor have I ever envied him.

189
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:39.460
I am not jealous of the works of the gods.

190
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:44.980
And I have no desire for lofty tyranny.

191
00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:50.730
This is where the word tyranny comes into the picture and even in that small

192
00:13:52.031 --> 00:13:53.890
collection of words,

193
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.250
you get some idea of what the Greeks meant by tyranny.

194
00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.280
They were talking about tremendous power from their perspective and it's golden

195
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:08.080
guide gs and that's not an accident.
They mean wealthy guide.

196
00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:13.081
GS tyrants are people who have lots of wealth and lots of power and they also

197
00:14:16.781 --> 00:14:21.781
rule in one translation that a poet's give for tyranny.

198
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:27.750
Those is for for lofty despotism.

199
00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:31.210
That is he rules not as an equal,

200
00:14:31.211 --> 00:14:34.420
he rules not as a legitimate king.

201
00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:39.450
He rules as a master ruling slaves is the implication of that.

202
00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:47.350
It is a,
it is.
It comes from the Greek perspective.
It comes from the east.

203
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:52.460
It is not native Greek.
It is something new.
In the Greek experience,

204
00:14:52.461 --> 00:14:56.540
they haven't had kings like that even in their legends.

205
00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:01.630
So that's going to be a central idea that surrounds the concept of tyranny.

206
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.440
The Greek word that comes closest to it,

207
00:15:06.441 --> 00:15:11.441
but it doesn't do the same job is Monarchos outward monarch.

208
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:16.680
And that simply means a ruler.
Who is one,
a single ruler?
Well,

209
00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.181
you know,

210
00:15:17.181 --> 00:15:20.900
you need a word for that and in Greek because that's not the natural thing in

211
00:15:20.901 --> 00:15:21.980
Greece.
As you know already,

212
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:27.430
every regime that we have discussed from the homer Homeric world on posts posts

213
00:15:28.521 --> 00:15:32.840
a Bronze Age,
um,
shows multiple kings,

214
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:38.100
um,
in,
in the Iliad,
the Odyssey,
yes,
there is the general list.

215
00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.730
Some of you remember Agamemnon,
but everybody there is a king.

216
00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:45.590
There's not just one king.
So that's,
that's the Greek way of looking at things.

217
00:15:45.591 --> 00:15:49.700
Whereas the rest of the world,
and if the Greeks had only known anywhere,

218
00:15:49.701 --> 00:15:51.050
you look in the rest of the world,

219
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:56.410
the typical regime is monarchy of one kind or another absolute power.

220
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.790
Nobody in Greece has absolute power in the Greek point of view,

221
00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.040
but kings elsewhere too,

222
00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:10.370
but is another sense that attaches for the Greeks to the word Tierra nos or

223
00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:11.360
[inaudible].

224
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:16.360
And that is that the power is not legitimately acquired.

225
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:23.420
The Greeks could understand that there'd be somebody called the boss allows and

226
00:16:23.421 --> 00:16:27.260
that the reason he was boss allows was that his father was,

227
00:16:27.261 --> 00:16:32.261
and that the regime of that state is royal and this is a perfectly legitimate

228
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:35.630
regime.
The Greeks,

229
00:16:35.631 --> 00:16:40.550
although they don't practice a kingship during the period that we studied,

230
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:44.450
uh,
they don't regard that as an illegitimate form of regime.

231
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.840
Kingship is legitimate.
Tyranny is not,

232
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.660
and I want to spell that out for you,

233
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:53.300
but before we get to my spelling it out for you,

234
00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:57.590
let me just give it a few more of the characteristics that it comes to have by

235
00:16:57.591 --> 00:17:01.340
classical times in the minds of the Greeks.
It is,
as I say,

236
00:17:01.341 --> 00:17:06.341
despotically exercise is not legitimate and one aspect of it's not being

237
00:17:06.831 --> 00:17:10.010
legitimate is that it is not responsible.

238
00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:15.450
A K a t around us does not have to explain himself and nobody would dare insists

239
00:17:17.411 --> 00:17:21.380
that he do.
He need not consult anybody if he doesn't want to.

240
00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.020
He doesn't need to have the approval of anybody.

241
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:27.770
All of that makes him illegitimate.

242
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:29.870
Irresponsible is another word.

243
00:17:29.871 --> 00:17:33.380
I think that fits into the picture because we shall see.

244
00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.360
That's certainly by the classical period.

245
00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:41.020
The Greeks felt any regime to be legitimate must be responsible in the technical

246
00:17:42.621 --> 00:17:47.621
term since it must be answerable to somebody because all human beings was the

247
00:17:49.531 --> 00:17:54.531
full philosophical core of this idea are not to be trusted by complete power.

248
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.840
They will abuse it.
They will abuse it with violence.
They will.

249
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:05.260
And that violence will very often mean sexual violence.
Uh,

250
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.070
but it will take every other form as well.

251
00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:13.170
And uh,
let's go back to our killer kisses.
Few words,

252
00:18:13.171 --> 00:18:16.290
which are so rich in telling us so much about it.
He says,

253
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:21.480
I am not jealous of the works of the gods.
What's that got to do with anything?

254
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:25.260
Well,
because the Greek view of tyranny was that tyrants.

255
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:30.870
And one of the things is wrong with tyrants is that they see themselves as

256
00:18:30.871 --> 00:18:35.520
rivaling the gods as thinking themselves to be divine,

257
00:18:35.521 --> 00:18:39.120
or at least thinking that they could act as though they were gods.

258
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:42.270
And because they have the power and the wealth and because they have no

259
00:18:42.271 --> 00:18:45.990
responsibility to anybody.
Uh,
presumably they can.

260
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:51.090
And this is one of the things that makes them terrible because when they do,

261
00:18:51.091 --> 00:18:56.091
it's this act of behaving as though they were gods is what the Greeks,

262
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.280
one of the things that the Greeks meant when they said Hubris,

263
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:01.770
this arrogant is violent,

264
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:06.980
arrogant kind of exercise of power.

265
00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:13.490
Now on the that's that is the way things look fundamentally in the classical

266
00:19:14.491 --> 00:19:17.790
period.
But even in the classical period,

267
00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:20.640
there was a remnant of I,

268
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:25.730
but I think and most scholars I think would agree was the special characteristic

269
00:19:25.801 --> 00:19:29.850
of the idea in its earlier days,
which was not so much how evil,

270
00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.580
uh,
a tyranny was.

271
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.100
Because in the early days it's not clear that they thought it was,

272
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:40.700
but because of the fact that it was not legitimately acquired,

273
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.800
it was not part of the normal way things happen.

274
00:19:46.801 --> 00:19:48.450
And I've mentioned this to you earlier,

275
00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:53.670
the good example of that is eat a paas tear on us.
Oedipus the king.

276
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:55.710
He did notice it.
They don't usually,

277
00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:00.740
nobody translates it eat IPIs the tyrants and their right not to do so because

278
00:20:00.841 --> 00:20:04.890
it would mislead us way.
We use the word tiring.
It's always back.

279
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:09.240
There's no good tiring,
but uh,
it so that you will,

280
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:13.860
you will often see a translated Oedipus rex into the Latin.

281
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.120
But rex means king.
So Oedipus the king is okay and it actually,

282
00:20:18.121 --> 00:20:20.430
it's not bad to say he just press rex because the,

283
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.760
the Romans had this idea that kings were bad.

284
00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:26.850
So there's a little bit of that glittering around the age.

285
00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:31.830
But for the Greeks that's not there at the beginning.
Okay.

286
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:37.340
Probably the contemporaries of guide gs and of the tyrants who came after him in

287
00:20:38.011 --> 00:20:42.750
Greece probably didn't use the term yet,
probably sprang up,
uh,

288
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:46.410
at a later time.
But we can't be sure of that.
For the Greeks,

289
00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:51.411
it originally meant something much more neutral without this great moral baggage

290
00:20:52.091 --> 00:20:55.690
to carry with it.
It's simply meant more than anything else.
Two things.

291
00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:59.230
One man rule.
Well,
I would always raise an eyebrow,

292
00:20:59.231 --> 00:21:04.231
but you could imagine it being okay and the fact that it was unconstitutional,

293
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.070
it did not come about in a way that followed tradition,

294
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:14.200
which was what Greek constitutions were traditional sets of laws or customs.

295
00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:17.380
Okay.
That's the general picture.

296
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:22.000
Let's take a look at tyranny as it emerges in Greece.
And,

297
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.580
uh,
we don't know very much about it.

298
00:21:24.581 --> 00:21:28.870
Here's another one of these cases where we are dependent on later sources.

299
00:21:28.871 --> 00:21:29.710
We have no,

300
00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:34.740
I think I'm right in saying nothing really contemporary at all that speaks about

301
00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:39.280
any tyrant.
Uh,
and so that's a problem,

302
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:40.450
but we have to deal with that.

303
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.640
And then there are very limited tails that are told about them so that we have

304
00:21:45.641 --> 00:21:49.390
to piece together a lot of information and ask ourselves what does it all mean.

305
00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:50.981
In any case,

306
00:21:50.981 --> 00:21:55.981
the first tyrant named in the Greek tradition is a man called fight on of our

307
00:21:57.731 --> 00:22:02.731
gos who is mentioned by Aristotle in his politics.

308
00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:07.270
And he says some interesting things that come back and amend with here are some

309
00:22:07.271 --> 00:22:09.290
of the facts or alleged facts that are,

310
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:14.260
that surround fight on in the Greek tradition.
One said,
oh,

311
00:22:14.261 --> 00:22:17.190
I see.
He is the king of our gos and Argos,
you know,
in,

312
00:22:17.191 --> 00:22:21.700
in the Homeric tradition is a very big,
powerful,
important place.

313
00:22:21.701 --> 00:22:25.750
Our ghosts includes my Sini,
uh,
and all of that.

314
00:22:25.751 --> 00:22:30.751
So this would be a king of a large and an important area that these are jives.

315
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:37.510
When a fight anonymous was a king of Argos were,

316
00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.153
uh,

317
00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:44.350
engaged in a conflict with Sparta as to who would be the dominant force in the

318
00:22:44.351 --> 00:22:45.184
Peloponnesus.

319
00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:50.790
And they fought a battle at a place called ECI in the year six 68 in which the

320
00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:56.820
are jives under fight on defeated the Spartans and really defeated him.

321
00:22:57.491 --> 00:22:59.170
Wasn't just a,
a little skirmish.

322
00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:04.290
They were now the top dog as proven by the following other alleged facts about

323
00:23:05.021 --> 00:23:09.760
what's going on here.
Fight on,
got himself elected chairman,

324
00:23:09.761 --> 00:23:12.640
president of the Olympic festival.

325
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:18.030
That was a tremendous honor and it indicated deference to him and scholars

326
00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:20.170
suggest if it really happened,

327
00:23:20.171 --> 00:23:25.171
that would have suggested they were the Argos and fight on where the dominant

328
00:23:25.451 --> 00:23:29.400
force in the Peloponnesus.
Um,
they,
uh,

329
00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:30.550
and further evidence,

330
00:23:30.551 --> 00:23:35.551
and this is really rather better evidence I think even than that is the fact I

331
00:23:35.591 --> 00:23:40.591
don't hesitate to use that fact that a fight out of August apparently imposed a,

332
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:46.250
a system of uniform weights and

333
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:48.740
<v 2>measures on the entire Peloponnesus.</v>

334
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:54.040
And those remained the weights and measures employed in the Peloponnesus

335
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:59.120
thereafter.
So that a,
they were called the [inaudible] measures.

336
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:04.540
You don't do that if you're not in a effective control of the region.

337
00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:08.360
Nothing is more basic than determining something like that.

338
00:24:08.361 --> 00:24:12.920
So I think that lends considerable plausibility to the general story.

339
00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:19.010
It is also said that he was a,
uh,

340
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:23.840
uh,
a leader of the army,
which was a hoplite army,

341
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.910
and that his success depended upon his successful leadership of the hoplite
army.

342
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.870
Well,

343
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:34.870
that fits in with one general interpretation that scholars have used about the

344
00:24:35.151 --> 00:24:38.150
arise of tyrants.
It's nobody claims it's universal.

345
00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:43.540
But one feature that seems to be plausibly present is that the new way of

346
00:24:46.281 --> 00:24:50.480
fighting in the hoplite Phalanx,
which was to turn out to be decisive,

347
00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:56.500
well that brought about that leaders who were very good leaders of hoplite

348
00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.760
Phalanx is and should they decide to seize power,

349
00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:06.230
uh,
in any state where they had been doing the leadership,

350
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:11.500
they could typically count on their army and the army they had led to assist

351
00:25:12.561 --> 00:25:14.990
them all,
which makes obvious sense.

352
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:17.540
If you're going to get the best fighting force around and they like you and

353
00:25:17.541 --> 00:25:20.690
you're popular and you want to be a boss,
that's your best shot.

354
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:25.760
So tradition also lends some small support to the idea that maybe that's how

355
00:25:25.761 --> 00:25:30.160
fight on himself to the kingship of before I depart,

356
00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:33.230
I just feel it necessary to make one small point.

357
00:25:33.231 --> 00:25:34.840
I said weights and measures the,

358
00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:39.900
there are elements in the ancient tradition that also say that fight on was the

359
00:25:40.161 --> 00:25:41.180
first man.

360
00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.810
I want to put it very carefully and literally because it's all part of the

361
00:25:44.811 --> 00:25:45.644
argument.

362
00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:51.040
He was the first man to strike silver coins on the island of [inaudible].

363
00:25:51.521 --> 00:25:56.521
Jina coins have not been present in Greece prior to this time.

364
00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:03.940
And the most well informed and a professionally skilled and capable people and

365
00:26:05.181 --> 00:26:08.990
almost everybody who studies the subject says this is false.

366
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:14.270
There were no coins in the Greek world yet and there aren't going to be any for

367
00:26:14.271 --> 00:26:16.040
a very long time afterwards.

368
00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:20.600
So this is merely a myth.
Um,

369
00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.860
I,
I'm sorry to say that in spite of the fact that I am not an expert,

370
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.910
a numismatist and,
uh,
everybody's against me,
they're all wrong.

371
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:33.950
Uh,
and I'm,
I won't put you through the pain of listening to the argument,

372
00:26:33.951 --> 00:26:37.130
but just keep in the back of your mind.

373
00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:41.900
One day somebody is going to find hard evidence that I'm absolutely right about

374
00:26:41.901 --> 00:26:45.690
this.
And so then you can tweak and say,
Aha,

375
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:48.300
because that's it.
But right now,

376
00:26:48.301 --> 00:26:50.970
no sensible person has any credit in the field at all.

377
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.660
Believes me there about two or three people.
Maybe that's about it.

378
00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.770
Okay.
Um,

379
00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:00.870
another very interesting,

380
00:27:00.871 --> 00:27:05.871
important element about fight on Aristotle tells us he was a king who became a

381
00:27:08.491 --> 00:27:09.930
tyrant.
Then by now,
you know,

382
00:27:09.931 --> 00:27:13.830
the Greek words he was boss allows who became Theranos.

383
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.870
Now how do you do that?
You would,
you would think of a man was king.

384
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.020
And that implies legitimacy.
Uh,

385
00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:25.320
how do you become an illegitimate thing like a tyrant?

386
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:29.100
And we can only speculate,
but I,
I think we,

387
00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:32.910
what we've learned already about the early Greek kings in those towns that had

388
00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:36.090
any,
was that they were Homeric canes.

389
00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:41.010
They were not really monarchs.
They were not really powerful rulers.
They did.

390
00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.980
They did not simply dominate everybody and give orders.

391
00:27:43.981 --> 00:27:48.981
They were maybe the most striking or the best connected are the best descendant

392
00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:53.040
of a bunch of noblemen who were roughly equal.
Well,

393
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:58.070
if we imagine that's the way fight on began and then I'm just making up the

394
00:27:59.071 --> 00:28:03.870
story,
you understand?
Uh,
then he himself led the,

395
00:28:03.871 --> 00:28:08.670
our jive Phalanx to these tremendous successes,
defeating the Spartans,

396
00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:11.670
establishing Argos as,
as,
uh,

397
00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:16.860
the president of the Olympic Games of giving waits measures.

398
00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:20.320
And Heaven help us maybe coins to,
uh,

399
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:24.770
the people of the Peloponnesus.
Um,

400
00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:30.050
and then began to act as though he really was the boss because he could,

401
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:36.060
and people recognize that and said,
you know,
he's not just king anymore.

402
00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.670
He has made himself a tear on those.

403
00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:45.180
Something like that would make sense of Aristotle's statesmen statement.

404
00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:49.380
Now it just raises the question which has to be raised whenever we think about

405
00:28:49.381 --> 00:28:54.030
tyrants coming to power in that and a Greece.
Um,
okay,

406
00:28:54.031 --> 00:28:58.010
he wants to be king,
he's popular and all those things.
But what does it take?

407
00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:02.700
Well,
it takes military force because there are people who are going to resist.

408
00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:08.280
And so I would suggest,
again,
nothing original about this,
that the,
uh,

409
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:14.180
the positive connection with the hoplite army now emerging in the states,

410
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:17.730
uh,
has to be part of the story.

411
00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:21.450
Why would these hoplites support a tyranny?

412
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:27.140
It doesn't really a chord with their own long range interests or the autonomy

413
00:29:28.321 --> 00:29:33.321
and the independence that are so clearly a part of what it is to be a hoplite

414
00:29:34.051 --> 00:29:35.280
farmer.
Well,

415
00:29:35.281 --> 00:29:40.281
I think the best answer would be that that's what had to be done to break the

416
00:29:40.291 --> 00:29:44.530
monopoly of power and influence of the old aristocracy,

417
00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:50.010
which would have been presumably resisting the changes in society that were part

418
00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:54.280
of that hoplite,
uh,
uprising,

419
00:29:54.281 --> 00:29:58.210
that development of hoplites to movement towards a hoplite community.

420
00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:03.540
And so they joined with a leader who had what it took to make it work and to

421
00:30:04.151 --> 00:30:09.151
destroy the power of the aristocracy and to create a new kind of state,

422
00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.030
uh,
with a new kind of constitution.

423
00:30:13.031 --> 00:30:18.031
But the first step would have been a tyranny because that's the way they got to

424
00:30:19.781 --> 00:30:22.510
where they had to go in the first instance.

425
00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:29.700
Now this is easy to connect again,

426
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:34.150
theoretically because we just don't have the kind of hard evidence that would

427
00:30:34.151 --> 00:30:35.410
make it possible to be sure

428
00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:41.680
to join this hoplite development with other changes that are occurring in

429
00:30:41.681 --> 00:30:42.161
society.

430
00:30:42.161 --> 00:30:46.990
And that is to say the economic change that means trade is becoming more and

431
00:30:46.991 --> 00:30:47.824
more important.

432
00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:53.220
And so is a simple industry so that there are now people in society who by

433
00:30:55.001 --> 00:30:58.780
virtue of what they do to make a living,
to get ahead,

434
00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.990
don't fit in to the traditional arrows,

435
00:31:01.991 --> 00:31:06.940
to cry aristocratic system who don't have what they want in terms of influence,

436
00:31:06.941 --> 00:31:11.530
power recognition,
uh,
because there hasn't been a place for such people before.

437
00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:16.180
And the,
the people who are in charge are not about to give it away very readily.

438
00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:20.680
And so they might very well,
uh,
also assist.

439
00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:25.450
Let us imagine the hoplite farmers as being the guys who do the fighting for the

440
00:31:25.451 --> 00:31:26.170
most part,

441
00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:31.170
but join then supported by these other elements in society who need a change for

442
00:31:32.021 --> 00:31:32.854
the same reason.

443
00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:38.340
And that fits rather nicely with where we find the earliest colonies are.

444
00:31:39.991 --> 00:31:41.950
Goss is a special place,

445
00:31:41.951 --> 00:31:46.540
but argus was in addition to being a fine agricultural area.
It also,

446
00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:50.710
from an early time it had the commercial activities.
So that would be good.

447
00:31:50.711 --> 00:31:52.810
But then on top of that,
the next three towns,

448
00:31:52.811 --> 00:31:55.990
I'm going to mention as being very active in colonization.

449
00:31:55.991 --> 00:31:58.700
You're familiar with that from our last talk.
Uh,

450
00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:04.080
Corinth and a little town that I haven't mentioned before,

451
00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:07.210
but it's right next to current.

452
00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:11.410
And surely it was part of the same set of developments that we've described

453
00:32:11.411 --> 00:32:16.250
there.
A place called [inaudible] also has an early,
uh,

454
00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:20.260
Tom Tyrannical family and mega,
which is located,

455
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:21.610
I should say 60 on,

456
00:32:21.611 --> 00:32:25.870
is sort of to the south and to the west of current and mega is to the north and

457
00:32:25.871 --> 00:32:27.040
to the east of Corinth.

458
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:32.310
It's right on and around the isthmus of Corinth that some of these early states

459
00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:38.100
that have tyrants come into being just as these are states that are very,

460
00:32:38.321 --> 00:32:42.020
very in the colonial movement.
Uh,

461
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:43.760
if we go away from the mainland,
again,

462
00:32:43.761 --> 00:32:47.630
my leeches has a tyrant at a fairly early time,

463
00:32:47.631 --> 00:32:50.360
just as you would expect because it fits into the whole picture.

464
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:54.800
And you don't have tyrannize very early,
if at all,

465
00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:59.390
in places like Athens,
we will have a famous tyrant,

466
00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:00.650
but that will come late.

467
00:33:00.651 --> 00:33:05.651
It thieves will not have a tyrant in spite of the mythology surrounding eat

468
00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:10.850
abyss.
Um,
Sparta of course never has the tiring.

469
00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.860
So,
uh,

470
00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:17.930
all of this is sort of reasonable support for the interpretation that most

471
00:33:17.931 --> 00:33:22.130
scholars take.
So you have all of this stuff,

472
00:33:22.131 --> 00:33:23.990
the pressure of a growing population,

473
00:33:23.991 --> 00:33:28.700
new groups challenging the aristocracy hoplites among them.

474
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:31.010
If you go to Corinth,

475
00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:36.000
the story of the establishment of a tyranny there involves a,
uh,

476
00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.150
an individual called KIPP solace.

477
00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:43.660
And the stories that are told about KIPP solice fit pretty decently into what

478
00:33:44.421 --> 00:33:48.930
we've been talking about.
He has specifically called a Poland mark,

479
00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:53.360
which means the war,
our con,
the war leader.

480
00:33:53.361 --> 00:33:57.340
He was a commander of the army in a,

481
00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:02.210
in a conference.
And at that time that would have been a hoplite army,

482
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:07.900
but he was not a king,
like fight on a,

483
00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:09.800
he was,
according to the myth,

484
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:13.460
I shouldn't say myths because it isn't a myth according to the legend that,

485
00:34:13.461 --> 00:34:15.160
you know,
it's not really even the lights at night,

486
00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:19.930
let's say tradition according to the tradition,
um,
kips,

487
00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:24.960
the list was a descendant from a mixed marriage between a patrician,

488
00:34:25.401 --> 00:34:29.870
a,
a,
an aristocrat and somebody who was not.
So that,

489
00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:34.490
that's a very comp,
sort of typical historical development.

490
00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:38.630
People who become revolutionaries in trouble makers are often people on the

491
00:34:38.631 --> 00:34:42.270
margin,
but who have by birds,

492
00:34:42.271 --> 00:34:46.220
some kind of a connection or think they have some kind of a connection with the

493
00:34:46.221 --> 00:34:51.080
higher ranks and are annoyed,
irritated,
angry,
jealous,

494
00:34:51.410 --> 00:34:55.940
and therefore likely to take the trouble to seize power.
I mean,

495
00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.450
Napoleon,

496
00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:01.460
a descendant from some kind of Corsican aristocracy.

497
00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:06.530
Of course the French thought that that was a,
well,
what does it,

498
00:35:06.531 --> 00:35:09.200
when the word it contradicts itself,

499
00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:17.120
what's the word?
No,
not paradox.
Oxymoron.

500
00:35:17.121 --> 00:35:22.080
That's right.
The French thought it was an oxymoron.
A Corsican,
Arista cracked.

501
00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:26.020
I mean ridiculous,
but,
but no,
but if that was his feeling and that,

502
00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:29.060
that kind of French attitude help,
I think,

503
00:35:29.061 --> 00:35:33.380
explain the drive that he had to get ahead to the green he did anyway.

504
00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:37.600
It keeps,
the list was a one of that.
A group in,

505
00:35:37.601 --> 00:35:42.601
in cars I might point out was an unusual policy before the emergence of the

506
00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:48.800
tyranny because most police,

507
00:35:48.801 --> 00:35:53.160
as best we can figure it out,
they had an aristocracy that consisted of many,

508
00:35:53.161 --> 00:35:57.570
many,
many,
many families,
but current had,

509
00:35:57.690 --> 00:35:59.610
uh,
the narrowest of all.

510
00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:03.870
Aristocracies one family who were called the Bacchae ads,

511
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:09.420
completely monopolized the regime.
And so that meant that there would,

512
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:14.480
it would be easier once you've started to make trouble to find help against

513
00:36:15.301 --> 00:36:16.134
them,

514
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:21.410
rather powerful people who were in other states likely to be part of the regime

515
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:27.030
but here were cut out.
And so,
uh,

516
00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:30.510
Kip solice joins,
uh,
comes,

517
00:36:30.511 --> 00:36:35.511
puts together a force of military folks with some folks who are discontented and

518
00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:42.560
finally a tax the backyards either kill them or drove them into exile.

519
00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:48.120
And then there is establishes his own regime,

520
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:52.140
which is in fact one of the most successful charities,

521
00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.980
at least as judged by the most basic thing.
How long do they last?

522
00:36:56.430 --> 00:37:00.710
Kip Solace in effect,
a died in bed,
leaving the,
uh,

523
00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.340
tyranny to his son.

524
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:06.990
And then his son had another son who became tyrant than he was driven out

525
00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:08.550
finally.
And he was the last of them.

526
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.420
So the kips Dillard tyranny is a very successful,

527
00:37:12.421 --> 00:37:14.690
why don't we know something about

528
00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:20.040
the colonization movement,
which had already,
the Corinthians had already started,

529
00:37:20.041 --> 00:37:24.960
but it really took a real hole in the time of the KIPP lids.

530
00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:29.960
And so Carnes has colonizing quite vigorously in the time of the capsule,

531
00:37:30.551 --> 00:37:35.551
it tyranny mostly out in the west because they,

532
00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.710
that's sort of empty territory for from a weak point of view.

533
00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:45.630
And so you will see Corinthian colonies stretching out along the shore,

534
00:37:45.631 --> 00:37:47.910
the north shore of the Gulf of Corinth.

535
00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:52.620
And the north shore is less Greek and more barbaric than the south trail,

536
00:37:52.621 --> 00:37:56.370
which is the Peloponnesus.
And then if you go to the,
to the,
uh,

537
00:37:56.430 --> 00:38:01.320
to the end of grease as far west as you go and make a right turn and head up

538
00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:05.580
into the Asiatic region,
uh,
the,
the,
oh,
sorry,

539
00:38:05.581 --> 00:38:08.160
the Ionian Sea and the,
uh,
beyond that,

540
00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:12.480
the Adriatic Corinthian colonies right along in there,

541
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:13.401
they suggest,

542
00:38:13.401 --> 00:38:18.240
and I think the supported by other archaeological evidence that commerce was one

543
00:38:18.241 --> 00:38:21.000
of the things that was very important for Kapsalis.

544
00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:26.010
And Corinth is booming from a commercial economic point of view in the years of

545
00:38:28.231 --> 00:38:31.890
the KIPP Salud tyrants.
None of that is surprising.

546
00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:36.400
All of this is very characteristic of this phase Greek tyranny that we're

547
00:38:36.401 --> 00:38:40.030
talking about.
Uh,
in addition to that,

548
00:38:40.031 --> 00:38:45.031
we know that Kipp solice like just about all the tyrants used his power to do

549
00:38:45.341 --> 00:38:49.000
something that the Greek governments normally did not do,

550
00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:53.020
namely collect taxes from their people.

551
00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:58.890
You have to understand that the idea that of taxation being normal would have

552
00:38:58.901 --> 00:39:03.901
gotten a Greek foaming at the mouth when there is no tyranny.

553
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:09.220
There's no taxes,
no direct tax,
I should say.
The,

554
00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:10.660
the normal,
uh,

555
00:39:10.661 --> 00:39:15.661
form of taxation that existed in the Greek world when it was in its independent

556
00:39:16.301 --> 00:39:20.560
polls phase is simply customs duties on trade.

557
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:25.150
But the hoplite farmer wasn't going to be taxed.

558
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:29.860
Paying taxes is what barbarians did to their kings.

559
00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:32.110
Very powerful feeling.

560
00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:38.110
People like that in America today are it used to be called Republicans.

561
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:39.783
<v 3>MMM.</v>

562
00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:46.600
<v 2>Another of course you might.
It's no surprise that kip.
So listen,</v>

563
00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:51.310
his descendants,
just like the other tyrants were very wealthy.

564
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.540
They,
there was undoubtedly wealthy seized when they took power.

565
00:39:55.570 --> 00:40:00.290
There was also wealthy.
They could enjoy from the,
uh,
tremendous,
uh,

566
00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:04.580
income that would come from the booming commerce.
Uh,

567
00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:06.070
and then finally taxation,

568
00:40:06.071 --> 00:40:09.070
just put it right smack from somebody who's hands into theirs.

569
00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:14.100
And so tremendous wealth is another picture that goes with this.

570
00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:16.523
<v 3>MMM.</v>

571
00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:22.500
<v 2>If you go to 60 on another element comes into the picture,</v>

572
00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:27.630
which may or may not have occurred in other tyrannical towns.

573
00:40:27.631 --> 00:40:31.740
We do know that it played a role in sicky on there.

574
00:40:31.741 --> 00:40:35.040
The founder of the tyranny was a man called [inaudible] Morris.

575
00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:37.163
And again,

576
00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:42.350
one thing we are told about him is that he was Paula mark leader of the

577
00:40:42.481 --> 00:40:45.240
failings.
So we understand that.

578
00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:50.600
Another story says that he was a cook and they didn't mean as golf ea or

579
00:40:51.871 --> 00:40:55.740
anything like that.
I mean,
that was not a high ranking position.

580
00:40:56.190 --> 00:41:00.300
And so I think the implication was he came from a very low source.

581
00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:04.680
We don't know what to do with that.
It sounds surprising,
but maybe it's true.

582
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.480
Anyway,
we get down to the point where one of his descendants is,
uh,

583
00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:15.270
uh,
still tiring.
I think it's his son,
Christ,

584
00:41:15.271 --> 00:41:17.790
the knees of sicky on when they,

585
00:41:17.791 --> 00:41:20.460
you want to keep that name in your mind and you want to keep it straight.

586
00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:21.030
There will,

587
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:26.030
there will be a descendant of that guy who will be an Athenian whose name is

588
00:41:28.171 --> 00:41:32.250
[inaudible],
who will not only be later,
but thoroughly different,

589
00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:35.780
not a tyrant,
quite different from that.
So just remember,

590
00:41:35.781 --> 00:41:39.680
this is close the knees of sicky on as opposed to Christ and these,

591
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:43.280
the Athenian,
well,
the picture that Hurghada Thomas,

592
00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:47.920
who was one of our main sources here,
the main source,
I guess,
uh,

593
00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:52.960
gives us is one of [inaudible] political oppression of a kind that we haven't

594
00:41:54.321 --> 00:41:59.321
run into yet because it is based on really on ethnic,

595
00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:05.150
uh,
origins and ethnic differences.

596
00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:09.110
Here we see,
I think without any question,

597
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:16.030
a case of the pre Dorian Greeks have been defeated and conquered by Dorian's and

598
00:42:22.011 --> 00:42:22.844
have been,

599
00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:28.300
these groups have been kept separate throughout the centuries and one was top

600
00:42:28.311 --> 00:42:32.570
dog and the other was the underdog.
So,
um,

601
00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:34.813
what you,
uh,

602
00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:40.060
what has happened obviously is that the part of the tyrants coming to power must

603
00:42:40.281 --> 00:42:45.281
have been a reversal of that situation because the leading forces are,

604
00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:50.060
um,
anti Dorian,

605
00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:52.310
very powerfully anti Dorian.

606
00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:57.770
They hate our gos because our boss is in the Iliad,
the Odyssey,

607
00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:02.890
the great leader of the Peloponnesians and the wrong guys.

608
00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.000
And of course our guys,

609
00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:09.990
the Argos in their day is a Dorian city and I,
Shit,

610
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:14.530
you don't have to go back to the [inaudible] back to the days of,
of,
um,
well,

611
00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:19.430
fight on the archives would've ruled sickie or presumably if a fight on was in

612
00:43:19.431 --> 00:43:24.020
charge.
Well,
they didn't like that they had achieved,
I presume,
a,

613
00:43:24.021 --> 00:43:28.010
an overthrow of that.
So they're antiar Gos,
anti Dorian,

614
00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:32.450
and they,
uh,
they introduced changes in the tribes.

615
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:37.040
If you go to any Dorian town in the Greek world,
there are three tribes.

616
00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:40.850
They have the same names in all Dorian towns.

617
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.210
And that's the way the world is organized.
So what did they do?

618
00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:48.200
These guys,
uh,
the,
uh,

619
00:43:48.201 --> 00:43:50.960
or saggy grids changed the tribes.

620
00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.220
That's interesting too because we'll see.
That's Christ.

621
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:58.580
And he's the Athenian does the same thing.
That's amazing.
That's very rare.

622
00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:01.860
When you were talking about changes in tribal things,
you,

623
00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:06.940
you're getting at the most an oldest possible memories and traditions and

624
00:44:07.821 --> 00:44:11.750
beliefs and associations that primitive peoples have.

625
00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:15.950
So when you fussing with that,
you're really making a great problem.

626
00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:21.370
Uh,
but you'll see in a moment what's driving this sort of thing.
Uh,

627
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:25.010
instead of having three tribes thereafter from the,

628
00:44:25.011 --> 00:44:27.560
once the auth average got there,
they had four,

629
00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:32.280
but they changed the names of the old three,
the old three.

630
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:33.940
Now we're called the,

631
00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:37.860
I'm translating the Greek words ass men,

632
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:42.300
pig men and swine men.

633
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:48.170
Whereas the non Dorian's where the are Holloway leaders of the people,

634
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:54.270
you can see very objective set of names and evaluations.

635
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:59.400
So you,
you've got vengeance here,
you've got a group long,

636
00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:03.240
uh,
annoyed,
long angered,
long feeling oppressed,

637
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:07.260
taking out their hatred when the victory comes in.

638
00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:13.140
But once you're past this peculiarity of this particular ethnic conflict in this

639
00:45:13.141 --> 00:45:17.130
town that had such an important effect,
um,

640
00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.190
you find that the tyrants are pretty much like all the other tyrants.

641
00:45:20.191 --> 00:45:22.620
They have great wealth.
They,

642
00:45:22.621 --> 00:45:26.550
and we'll come back in just a moment to indicate how striking that was.

643
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:31.290
They engage in conspicuous display,
which is what tyrants also do.

644
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:36.080
Uh,
and they are filled with a tremendous ego,

645
00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:39.510
terrific sense of their own importance and self.

646
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:42.030
The kind of thing that made our killock is say,
you know,

647
00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:46.830
I'm not going to try to Ed vibe with the gods the way these Tyrone's do.

648
00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:49.390
Well,
the story that are routed,

649
00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:54.150
this tells them I think you will enjoy it in his wonderful prose if you haven't

650
00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:57.480
gotten to it yet,
is um,

651
00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:03.240
uh,
Kleist the needs of sicky on now is in charge of,

652
00:46:03.241 --> 00:46:08.241
we're in the sixth century BC and he has a daughter and uh,

653
00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:14.780
he wants her to have the very best husband that there was available in Greece.

654
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:22.530
Just like your parents.
He felt the same way as your parents do.
So,

655
00:46:22.531 --> 00:46:25.650
but he was going to see to it that was going to work out.
By the way.

656
00:46:25.651 --> 00:46:30.140
He himself was a very significant figure and this again makes him nuts.

657
00:46:30.141 --> 00:46:34.980
So very unusual among the tyrants he entered,
uh,
in,
um,

658
00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:39.300
in the Olympic competition.
And in those days,

659
00:46:39.301 --> 00:46:43.260
and probably forever in the Olympic Games,
I mean the ancient Olympic Games,

660
00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:45.150
the most prestigious,

661
00:46:45.151 --> 00:46:49.770
the most important contest was the four horse horse race,

662
00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:54.450
chariot race.
For one thing,
you couldn't do that unless you were very rich.

663
00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:58.650
So it meant that the noblest and wealthiest people with competing against one

664
00:46:58.651 --> 00:47:03.450
another in this,
well,
he was the winner in the four horse chariot race,

665
00:47:03.451 --> 00:47:08.100
which made him an international celebrity on top of all the other things that he

666
00:47:08.101 --> 00:47:09.060
had going for him.

667
00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:12.390
And so he decides by God he's going to have the best guy in Grimsby,

668
00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:16.560
his daughter's husband,
he invites,
uh,

669
00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:21.570
all the most,
the best aristocratic,
richest,

670
00:47:21.571 --> 00:47:26.571
handsome is most athletic guys in all of Greece to come to sicky on and spend a

671
00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:35.940
at his expense and treated royally all that time to compete for the hand of his

672
00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:44.740
daughter.
And so they all are in erotic.

673
00:47:44.741 --> 00:47:49.000
This reads off the names of all of these amazing young men who come to the

674
00:47:49.001 --> 00:47:50.740
competition.
Uh,

675
00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:55.090
pretty much I think copying a Homer's list,
uh,

676
00:47:55.230 --> 00:48:00.230
of the catalog of the ships in the Elliot and they come well after the bulk of

677
00:48:02.261 --> 00:48:07.030
this year,
it is clear to finalists are emerging.

678
00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:13.020
One of them is called hip hop clades and the other is called Mega Clis mega

679
00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:16.953
clis.

680
00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:21.960
We better take seriously because he's an Athenian and he will be the ancestor of

681
00:48:22.001 --> 00:48:25.750
Christ,
the means of Athens later on.
But anyway,

682
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:29.890
they're competing in every respect and we're down to the last kinds of things

683
00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:33.400
and it looks like a Hipaa.
[inaudible] has the edge,

684
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:38.710
he seems to be the number one candidate and he has quite a few belts at the

685
00:48:38.711 --> 00:48:42.460
party when we're reaching the final stages of all this.

686
00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:47.880
And next he jumps up on a table and he begins dancing wildly.

687
00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:52.710
I mean like beyond what is seem to be seemingly dancing.

688
00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:55.510
We expect a young nobleman to be a good dancer,

689
00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:59.200
but this guy is doing stuff that nobody ever heard of it.

690
00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:03.700
And this is making a [inaudible].
He's a little nervous.
I mean,

691
00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:07.120
who is this guy mean?
What's happening here?

692
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:12.750
And then he flips upside down and begins to dance on his hands with his feet

693
00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:16.450
flipping around in the air,

694
00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:21.940
at which point her out at this tells us Kleiser and he speaks up and says,

695
00:49:21.941 --> 00:49:24.220
son of Thai Sander,

696
00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:29.140
you have danced your bride away.
He lost.

697
00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:34.150
And Mega Clis got to marry hiphop ladies.
Uh,
rather,
uh,

698
00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:38.380
[inaudible].
And the story goes on.
Well,
what are we to believe of that tail?

699
00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:42.760
I Dunno,
but this much I think is clear.

700
00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:45.070
Such a legend does not come from nothing.

701
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:49.780
The picture is first of all of a man who was fabulously wealthy,

702
00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:55.170
think of the kind of entertaining he has said to have done also fabulously full

703
00:49:57.671 --> 00:50:01.360
of himself.
Uh,
just,
you know,
imagine saying,

704
00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:06.460
my daughter will only marry the very best young men there is and you will all

705
00:50:06.461 --> 00:50:10.230
have to go out there and compete for her hand and I'll tell you who she's going

706
00:50:10.231 --> 00:50:14.890
to marry and who can then act the way he did.
I think that's

707
00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:21.660
a picture that he probably was extreme in all of these respects and that kind of

708
00:50:22.451 --> 00:50:24.130
situation was part of the tail.

709
00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:29.000
So let me just sum up some things.

710
00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:33.770
Untraditional route to power is important.

711
00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:38.000
Guide gs.
Perhaps you remember the story of guides,
these guides.

712
00:50:38.001 --> 00:50:42.930
These was a sort of the prime minister of the King of uh,

713
00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:45.950
uh,
Lydia and the king was,

714
00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:50.900
had this incredibly beautiful wife and he was terribly proud of her.

715
00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:56.100
And so he said to guide is,
you can't believe how gorgeous my wife is.
Guide.

716
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:58.160
He says,
of course she's wonderfully beautiful.

717
00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:03.200
You can't tell it with our clothes on for God's sake.
He says,
come on,

718
00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:07.760
come with me,
because she says,
no,
no,
no,
please your majesty.
He says,
come with me.

719
00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:11.870
So this guy just hidden behind a curtain and here's his wife.

720
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:16.640
Disrobing uh,
and indeed she was as advertised

721
00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:22.700
and the king goes out.

722
00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:26.950
Guide use would have slipped away,
but the queen's spots them.

723
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:30.680
And of course she's totally disgraced.

724
00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:35.390
She's deeply embarrassed as to put it very,
very mildly.

725
00:51:35.391 --> 00:51:40.070
And so she says to him,
unless you do what I tell you,

726
00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:46.340
I will tell my husband that you sneaked in and did this and that he will kill

727
00:51:46.341 --> 00:51:47.174
you.

728
00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:52.480
But what I want you to do is to kill him and marry me.

729
00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.300
That's how you can make what could guide you used to.

730
00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:01.730
And so he did.
That's how we became king.

731
00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:06.380
This is not your normal constitutional procedure even in Lydia.

732
00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:11.180
So,
uh,
that guy,
Geez,
fight on,

733
00:52:11.181 --> 00:52:15.320
I've talked to you about already,
the agonies of Meger I haven't mentioned,

734
00:52:15.321 --> 00:52:17.240
but he comes to power by force,

735
00:52:17.610 --> 00:52:21.290
but the use of the soldiers and the same thing is true of Kipp solice.

736
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:25.460
All these tyrants get there by means that are not traditional.

737
00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:29.810
They have personal power.
Whatever else is going on.

738
00:52:29.811 --> 00:52:34.811
They have control of the military and the military gives them what they need in

739
00:52:35.001 --> 00:52:38.420
the way of command.
They,
uh,

740
00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.340
have to have skill.

741
00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:44.240
The founder of the dynasty at least has to have skill.

742
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:47.240
In order to be a soldier,
he has to have a,

743
00:52:47.241 --> 00:52:49.880
be a good talker to get people to go along with them.
The,

744
00:52:49.881 --> 00:52:51.080
he's got to have talent.

745
00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:55.490
It's not the easiest thing in the world to do to overthrow a traditional regime

746
00:52:55.610 --> 00:52:59.480
and make yourself the boss so that z,
he would have had these quotes,

747
00:52:59.481 --> 00:53:03.530
but he's got to have support out there from the various elements that I

748
00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:08.420
mentioned to you,
prestige from some great deed,
whatever it might be,

749
00:53:08.421 --> 00:53:12.590
military victory or,
uh,
athletic victory perhaps.

750
00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:17.480
Um,
and when he has wealth,

751
00:53:17.481 --> 00:53:18.830
once he's acquired wealth,

752
00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:22.610
he can use it further to strengthen his position.

753
00:53:22.611 --> 00:53:26.520
And they typically do because he introduces something new.

754
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.770
Mercenary soldiers.

755
00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:34.730
It's one thing to seize the power with the help of the hoplites to hold onto it.

756
00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:39.720
You're going to need something more solid than that.
First of all,

757
00:53:39.721 --> 00:53:41.700
hoplites don't stick around in uniform.

758
00:53:41.701 --> 00:53:45.480
They go back and work their fields so they're not around to suppress anything

759
00:53:45.481 --> 00:53:49.380
that needs to be suppressed most of the time.
But beyond that,

760
00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:54.330
uh,
tyrants grow unpopular.
Uh,
you know,

761
00:53:54.331 --> 00:53:57.570
this is one of the great rules of politics in any system.

762
00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:01.950
The one question that's in the minds of all people who have anything to do with

763
00:54:01.951 --> 00:54:06.120
it.
And that is what have you done for me lately?
Any,

764
00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:09.960
any benefit that people might have achieved from the establishment of the

765
00:54:09.961 --> 00:54:12.930
tyranny gets to be taken for granted after a while.

766
00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:17.040
And then why is this guy taking taxes for me?
Why,

767
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:21.390
why is he such a big shot?
And I'm not?
That's just going to be inevitable.

768
00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:25.830
And so,
uh,
if you're going to keep your power and keep people down,

769
00:54:25.831 --> 00:54:27.840
you can't just rely on the citizen body.

770
00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:33.110
And so tyrants typically hire foreigners to serve as mercenaries for them.

771
00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:39.480
Now another thing is that while these tyrannize last,

772
00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:44.840
it is typical that they should accomplish very significant things that most

773
00:54:46.831 --> 00:54:51.831
anybody would agree we're positive contributions to the life of the community.

774
00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:57.350
They ruled you find economic prosperity is one of the things that is

775
00:55:00.031 --> 00:55:02.100
characteristic of these regimes.

776
00:55:02.101 --> 00:55:07.101
Diversified economies because they support trade and industry and sometimes even

777
00:55:07.231 --> 00:55:08.064
agriculture,

778
00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:12.690
the spread of wealth to new groups cause as much more money around.

779
00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:17.490
There are people who don't fit into the old system in which the land was simply

780
00:55:17.491 --> 00:55:18.060
the,
uh,

781
00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:23.060
dominated by the aristocrats and where there was no other way to make any money

782
00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:27.900
or make any weight,
gain any wealth.
So all of that is happening.

783
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:32.640
Uh,
and of course many of the kings of the,
sorry,
of the tyrants,

784
00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:36.900
uh,
foster and engage in colonization,

785
00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:41.760
which has all the benefits I mentioned last time as well.

786
00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:46.320
Now there's another thing that is characteristic of tyrannies.

787
00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:51.180
When they make themselves tyrant,
they come to live if they,

788
00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:56.210
whether they did before or not in what is the major city of that whole Polis,

789
00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:02.130
the capitol,
so to speak.
And it's always been a place that had,

790
00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:05.940
would have a special place.
You know,
it's where the,
the,
uh,
uh,

791
00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.520
Acropolis is and therefore where the worship of the gods takes place.

792
00:56:09.521 --> 00:56:10.890
But it's just worship with the gods everywhere.

793
00:56:10.891 --> 00:56:14.220
But that's a special place for them.
There was always a special place,

794
00:56:14.221 --> 00:56:18.240
but now that's becomes the center of the community.
And as a result,

795
00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:21.030
because where the tyrant is,
that's where all the action is.

796
00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:26.480
People begin to move into that capital city if they leave the land of their

797
00:56:27.401 --> 00:56:30.850
fathers and some number of them,
in fact,
do.

798
00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:33.850
If you're going to conduct commercial activity,

799
00:56:33.851 --> 00:56:36.310
if you're going to conduct the factory work,

800
00:56:36.550 --> 00:56:40.420
and if you're going to be somehow involved in the various aspects of government

801
00:56:40.421 --> 00:56:42.870
and uh,
things that have to do with retirement,

802
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.090
you want to be there and the Qataris have courts.

803
00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:49.360
And so people come to be in the court of the Tyron.

804
00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:54.870
So what you have is a kind of urbanization that is characteristic of this

805
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:58.870
period.
Well,

806
00:56:58.871 --> 00:57:03.871
if you're going to have more people living in this town than ever did before,

807
00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:08.620
there's all sorts of things you need.
Number one,
no question.
Number one,

808
00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:10.060
water supply.

809
00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:15.160
How do you supply people with enough water to meet their needs,

810
00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:17.620
uh,
when they weren't there before?

811
00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:20.980
And the answer is you have to bring water into the system,

812
00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:24.680
into the city by a variety of ways.
Um,

813
00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:29.450
any way that you really can,
they do,
um,

814
00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:32.110
aqueducts of certain kind.

815
00:57:32.111 --> 00:57:36.370
They dig wells and have fountains coming from those wells.

816
00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:40.170
They build fountain houses to cover those fountains.
Uh,

817
00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:42.850
they'd bring a water supply.
Also.

818
00:57:42.851 --> 00:57:46.180
If you're going to have these common places where a lot of people live who

819
00:57:46.181 --> 00:57:51.181
didn't live there before drainage is essential or else you will have terrible

820
00:57:51.911 --> 00:57:55.960
disease breaking out.
It's not that they were scientists and knew about germs.

821
00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:59.950
It's just that if you know when there's a lot of people there and that there's a

822
00:57:59.951 --> 00:58:01.240
lot of waterline around,

823
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:04.540
people seem to die so you don't have to be a genius for that.

824
00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:10.170
There is there our sewer systems introduced by these tyrants which never existed

825
00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:15.670
before and since they are trying to encourage trade,

826
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.930
there was always a place,
I shouldn't say there was always,

827
00:58:19.931 --> 00:58:24.310
but at some point in the development of the Polis there emerged a kind of

828
00:58:24.311 --> 00:58:27.850
central place in the city called the ag or raw,

829
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:33.280
which was a place that people came together for different purposes.

830
00:58:33.790 --> 00:58:37.300
It looks like in the beginning,
political meetings,

831
00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:41.690
meetings of the Assembly for instance might take place in the Agora.

832
00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:46.510
It pretty early seem to have had some religious significance.

833
00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:49.270
And then over time,
not at the beginning though,

834
00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:53.800
but over time they became commercial centers in our,

835
00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:58.690
if you use the word Auger rock in Greece today,
you're talking about a shop,

836
00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:02.020
uh,
because that's how much that comes to be the thing.

837
00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:05.380
But we need to keep in mind that it is a religious center.

838
00:59:05.410 --> 00:59:09.740
It becomes a civic center.
And it also of course was a,
uh,

839
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:13.530
commercial center as well.
And,
uh,

840
00:59:13.810 --> 00:59:18.810
so the Agora Ross comes from these a tyrannical periods.

841
00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:22.520
Public buildings are by the,

842
00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:26.090
and for whatever use he needs.
But he might,

843
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:29.240
he might be building a courthouses,

844
00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:33.770
he might be building up places for magistrates to stay,
things like that.

845
00:59:34.310 --> 00:59:36.340
Um,
and uh,

846
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:41.410
but also he has a tendency to try to make them very attractive,

847
00:59:42.681 --> 00:59:47.681
very impressive so that people will be impressed with him for having done so.

848
00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:50.120
You,
you're,
you know,

849
00:59:50.121 --> 00:59:55.121
the phenomenon people like to have now they'd like to have their name on a

850
00:59:55.221 --> 00:59:55.641
building.

851
00:59:55.641 --> 00:59:59.690
I'm told they will actually give you millions and millions of dollars to put

852
00:59:59.691 --> 01:00:00.830
their name on a building.

853
01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:04.820
I'm told there are places where they will even give you lots of money to put

854
01:00:04.821 --> 01:00:06.410
their uh,

855
01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:09.860
their names on the bathroom stalls,

856
01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:15.260
but only the,
uh,
the uh,
tyrants in their day.

857
01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:18.950
What have been rich enough to do the kind of thing we're talking about
including,

858
01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:22.220
and this is a very large thing,
I believe templates.

859
01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:26.870
The Greeks had been building temples I'm sure for a long time,

860
01:00:26.871 --> 01:00:29.000
but essentially out of wood.

861
01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:33.590
But now with people having the kind of wealth that we're being accumulated by

862
01:00:33.591 --> 01:00:34.341
these tyrants,

863
01:00:34.341 --> 01:00:39.341
they begin to build them of stone and where possible of very fine stone such as

864
01:00:41.031 --> 01:00:41.864
marble.

865
01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:47.240
And I think we have to imagine the construction of such a building and an old

866
01:00:47.241 --> 01:00:51.500
town like a,
anyone of the Greek city states had,

867
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:54.290
it would have had a tremendous impact.

868
01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:58.280
This is something I'd like to pass on to.
When you think about the Greeks,

869
01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:02.630
here's one of the places where there so stunningly different from us that we

870
01:01:02.631 --> 01:01:06.710
need to make an imaginative leap to understand what's going on.
Remember,

871
01:01:06.711 --> 01:01:11.711
this is a world that has got no next to no writing.

872
01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:15.140
This is,
there were a few,
there are a lot.

873
01:01:15.210 --> 01:01:17.900
There's some people that know how to write,
but it's not part of life.

874
01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:20.000
And of course there's no paper.

875
01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:24.830
So I mean just to just get more writing out of your life for the most part.

876
01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:29.600
But also there are,
there's no movies,
there's no television,

877
01:01:29.601 --> 01:01:33.110
there's no radio,
there's no newspapers.
Uh,

878
01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.300
there were very few buildings

879
01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.140
now up suddenly up pups,

880
01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:45.160
let's go to Karnes and suddenly up pops this incredible thing made of stone,

881
01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:52.900
a temple to the gods decorated beautifully painted,

882
01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:58.660
typically blue and red and gold with a big statue of the goddess.

883
01:02:02.550 --> 01:02:05.660
And anybody in town can go by and look at that.

884
01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:12.400
That would have made a sensational experience and people would have been talking

885
01:02:12.981 --> 01:02:17.150
about it in various elements of detail forever and a day.

886
01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:22.110
And they would not forget who it was that constructed that temple.

887
01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:27.240
So that's a,
an example of what I'm talking about.
Beyond that,
the,

888
01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:30.870
uh,
the tyrants were patrons of the arts,

889
01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:36.150
by which I mean architects,
sculptors,

890
01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:41.130
painters,
painters of this,
that,
and the other thing.
But vase painters as well.

891
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:46.080
Potter's have a very special kind,
but that's not all.
Also poets,

892
01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.100
singers,
liar players,

893
01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:55.940
all of those kinds of entertainments which had been monopolized by the

894
01:02:56.611 --> 01:03:01.611
aristocracy to the degree they existed at all would now be broadly more broadly

895
01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:04.380
available.
And the uh,

896
01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:09.410
the time it's took pride in bringing the world's best to their cities and

897
01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:15.440
allowing at least some of them to hear and see what was going on.

898
01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.480
When we get to Athens,

899
01:03:18.481 --> 01:03:22.380
I'll be more specific when we have some more specific information about it.

900
01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:28.300
So that is all part of a story that would have made the,

901
01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:31.260
the tyrannies,
uh,

902
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:35.270
much more widely supported and much not and,

903
01:03:35.290 --> 01:03:40.110
and not so easy to knock over as you might think.
People would have had many,

904
01:03:40.111 --> 01:03:45.111
many reasons for gratitude to the tyrants and would have been very pleased by

905
01:03:46.051 --> 01:03:48.720
much of what the tyrants were doing.
Of course,

906
01:03:48.721 --> 01:03:52.860
the old aristocrats would have been typically very unhappy about everything they

907
01:03:52.861 --> 01:03:56.310
were doing because they had been cut out.
But if you go to everybody else,

908
01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:00.330
their feelings I think would have been mixed because first,

909
01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:02.400
or I don't know which came first,

910
01:04:02.401 --> 01:04:05.670
but they wouldn't be impressed and enjoy these positive things,

911
01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:10.950
but they would also be troubled by something that was counter to their own

912
01:04:10.951 --> 01:04:15.951
traditions and to central elements of their own beliefs and concerns.

913
01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:21.860
I keep thinking about those hoplite farmers and who have grown to be confident

914
01:04:23.850 --> 01:04:27.810
and independent desire to be autonomous,

915
01:04:27.811 --> 01:04:30.690
didn't want to be told what to do.
Uh,

916
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:33.960
and yet there was somebody who was doing just that.

917
01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:38.130
So this is the conflict that there is.
And in fact,

918
01:04:38.131 --> 01:04:43.131
what we see is a steady decline in the popularity of tyrannies from generation

919
01:04:44.371 --> 01:04:47.310
to the generation,
the founder of the tyranny.

920
01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:51.240
He's probably still popular when he dies.
He did it.

921
01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:54.660
Most people are very conscious of what he achieved and he's a glorious figure.

922
01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:59.190
But his son is only tyrant because he was his son.
It does.

923
01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:01.290
He doesn't come from his personal qualities.

924
01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:06.800
And one is becomes more and more aware of the shortcomings and fewer and fewer

925
01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:10.650
people are interested in the achievements,

926
01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:12.930
even though they may do wonderful things.

927
01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:16.230
And by the time you get to the third generation,
that's the end.

928
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:19.960
The a generation of tiring.
It gets thrown out if you've made the,

929
01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:24.970
it made it that far.
And when the tyranny is overthrown,

930
01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:27.730
the typical,
uh,

931
01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:32.790
successor to the Thai radical regime is an oligarchy.

932
01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:36.220
I would say

933
01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:43.080
it would include many of the old aristocrats who had the best land and the

934
01:05:44.411 --> 01:05:45.370
greatest wealth.

935
01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:50.550
And indeed the chances are those people would be the leaders of the new regime.

936
01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:56.620
But they would very quickly,
because it was not a monarchy of any kind,

937
01:05:56.950 --> 01:06:01.950
they would very quickly form into factions that would be competing with one

938
01:06:02.621 --> 01:06:06.190
another based on all kinds of different things,
uh,

939
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:08.320
which would compete with one another,

940
01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:12.490
the leader of each faction for becoming the leading faction,

941
01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:16.900
the dominant figures in the state.
But also,

942
01:06:16.901 --> 01:06:18.070
and this is much more important,

943
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:23.430
the really fundamental thing is typically almost always the hoplite class of

944
01:06:25.901 --> 01:06:30.430
independent farmer would have participated in this regime.

945
01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.370
He would have been a full fledged citizen

946
01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:39.880
fighting would be done chiefly by the Phalanx with these folks doing the

947
01:06:39.881 --> 01:06:42.040
fighting.
The,

948
01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:46.990
these men would be the economic backbone of the community turning out the grain

949
01:06:46.991 --> 01:06:50.380
and the wine and the olive oil and whatever else,

950
01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:55.050
vegetables that they had to produce.
And uh,
being,
uh,

951
01:06:55.090 --> 01:06:56.710
the independent fellows that they were.

952
01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:01.920
And finally they would have played a part in the political life of the city

953
01:07:02.801 --> 01:07:05.800
here.
It would vary from town to town.
Uh,

954
01:07:05.830 --> 01:07:10.000
you might have a relatively narrow oligarchy in which the council was what

955
01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:14.200
counted and that that would be typical council would count,

956
01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:19.440
but it might be very narrowly defined or it could be very broadly defined where

957
01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:24.730
it might include Ali,
all the hotlines or something in between.

958
01:07:25.570 --> 01:07:28.960
But not ever until we get to Athens.

959
01:07:28.961 --> 01:07:31.000
Would you get a democracy?

960
01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:36.030
The definition being that every adult male who is born of a native parents is a

961
01:07:38.741 --> 01:07:43.741
citizen and who has some significant political rights that doesn't come yet.

962
01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:49.290
You have an oligarchy,
meaning short of that.
But with the,
with the,
uh,

963
01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:52.360
variations,
I've indicated currents for instance,

964
01:07:52.361 --> 01:07:55.360
after they get rid of the tire and finally is,

965
01:07:55.361 --> 01:08:00.361
becomes famous in the Greek tradition for the moderation and therefore the

966
01:08:01.031 --> 01:08:05.500
longevity and peacefulness of its oligarchic regime.

967
01:08:05.650 --> 01:08:10.470
I think we should imagine that the Corinthians became a hoplite,

968
01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:15.130
uh,
city.
Not that they didn't have a Rissa cracks who had wealth and importance,

969
01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:19.370
but at the hoplites really played a central part in the picture.

970
01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:24.410
And I think I,
just to raise the question,

971
01:08:24.411 --> 01:08:27.800
I remember I raised it about colonization.
Let me raise it about tyranny.

972
01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:33.280
What were the contributions made by this development in Greek history to the

973
01:08:34.341 --> 01:08:35.450
life of Greeson?

974
01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:40.840
They were mini obviously economic goal growth in the way I've pointed out social

975
01:08:43.581 --> 01:08:46.160
change up to a certain point,

976
01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:51.790
but certainly doing a way for forever with the aristocracy of birth as the

977
01:08:53.121 --> 01:08:58.121
normal basis for citizenship and participation in the state.

978
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:59.930
And I would go further.

979
01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:06.040
I would say that by destroying that and substituting for it some kind of an

980
01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:10.010
economic basis for what role you play,

981
01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:15.320
they actually opened the door for a form of government that didn't come in many

982
01:09:15.321 --> 01:09:20.240
places but did come and some,
and I'm talking about a Greek democracy.

983
01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:27.520
Let me riff very finally to the question of how did Greeks think about tyranny

984
01:09:28.730 --> 01:09:30.890
after tyranny was gone?

985
01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:36.520
Because it played a terrific role in Greek thinking and had a lot to do with the

986
01:09:39.411 --> 01:09:43.880
way the Greeks felt about their relations with foreign powers,
uh,

987
01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:45.740
and uh,
and their own regimes.

988
01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:49.940
One thing I'll just say in passing and come back to it next time,

989
01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:55.180
and that is Sparta because of its behavior in the sixth century and a little bit

990
01:09:56.031 --> 01:09:57.050
into the fifth,

991
01:09:57.230 --> 01:10:02.230
developed a reputation as being the state that was the enemy of tyranny.

992
01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.450
They never developed a tyranny.

993
01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:08.840
And then d they often fought against tyrants.

994
01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:12.230
And that was when tyranny was gone.

995
01:10:12.231 --> 01:10:17.231
That was seen to be a great credit to them and helped explain how did it happen

996
01:10:17.301 --> 01:10:21.650
that Sparta emerged and rose to the level as the leader of the Greeks,

997
01:10:21.651 --> 01:10:25.490
which they certainly were at the time of the Persian wars.

998
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:31.710
Beyond that though,
the picture that comes down to us,
it's,
it's all,

999
01:10:31.730 --> 01:10:36.730
it will be a double picture in which opposite elements exist,

1000
01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:41.900
but certainly the dominant one is negative.

1001
01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:46.520
Tyrannies are arbitrary,
they are violent,

1002
01:10:47.150 --> 01:10:51.770
tyrants are arrogant.
They do not permit free speech,

1003
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:54.140
which by the way,
the Greeks placed it.

1004
01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:59.410
The Greek Democrats placed in a very central place in the important things that

1005
01:11:00.981 --> 01:11:05.480
are necessary for a man,
a Greek,
a citizen,
a person who was not a barbarian.

1006
01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:11.050
The ability to come forward into the center of political life and speak your

1007
01:11:12.681 --> 01:11:16.620
mind and when you didn't have that to some considerable degree,

1008
01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:20.940
you were a slave and tyrants didn't permit that.

1009
01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:25.350
There was no true political life for citizens.

1010
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:30.590
They were de facto subjects of this timer who himself was an irresponsible,

1011
01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:35.310
not responsible to another body,

1012
01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:40.200
and therefore potentially dangerous and in,

1013
01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:44.610
in very easily could become a,
a,
a dead spot,

1014
01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:47.450
which is a Greek word.
Uh,

1015
01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:52.470
Hirata [inaudible] uses tyranny as a critically,

1016
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:57.210
well,
you know,
by and large,
he depicts the Picts,
the king of Persia,

1017
01:11:57.570 --> 01:12:00.840
who finally invades Greece,
uh,

1018
01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:04.080
for in first and for 99,
another king of four 80.

1019
01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:09.380
These men are tyrants because they fit precisely the categorization of tyranny

1020
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:14.550
as the Greeks know it.
In a East [inaudible] play,

1021
01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:19.760
Prometheans bound Zeus himself is seen to be a tyrant,

1022
01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:25.260
and the word is used of him by characters in the play.

1023
01:12:25.530 --> 01:12:30.530
For the same reason he's punishing prometheus's for his good deeds towards men,

1024
01:12:31.410 --> 01:12:35.820
which make men more divine than they would otherwise be.
Zeus is very angry.

1025
01:12:35.821 --> 01:12:38.820
That's because it gave them fire.
Zeus is very,

1026
01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:42.680
very angry with him and he,
he locks him up.

1027
01:12:42.681 --> 01:12:47.681
A chain is him to a rock in the Caucasus mountains while birds are pecking away

1028
01:12:48.541 --> 01:12:53.541
at his liver forever and ever a typical Greek hell of the worst kind.

1029
01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:54.900
Uh,

1030
01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:59.900
and we are led in what we have of that play to think zoos is doing terrible

1031
01:13:02.131 --> 01:13:02.964
things.

1032
01:13:03.090 --> 01:13:07.980
He is behaving to radically that is not good even for the king of the gods.

1033
01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:14.010
Plato,
of course,
we'll,
uh,
regard tyranny later on is of terribly evil thing.

1034
01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:16.740
And because of his anti-democratic prejudices,

1035
01:13:16.770 --> 01:13:21.480
we'll say tyranny is the natural outcome of democracy because people can't rule

1036
01:13:21.481 --> 01:13:23.580
themselves.
They're not competent to do so.

1037
01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:27.930
And it's only a matter of time before some strong violent selfish man makes

1038
01:13:27.931 --> 01:13:29.220
himself tyranny.

1039
01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:37.160
It is a distinguishing feature in Greek thought tyranny or monarchy.

1040
01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:43.050
These are not appropriate for freemen.
That is to say Greeks,

1041
01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:44.071
Greeks,

1042
01:13:44.071 --> 01:13:49.071
they felt were by nature free and they couldn't be free so long as there was

1043
01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:51.773
tyranny.

1044
01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:56.960
But tyranny was in fact the natural way of life for barbarians who are not by

1045
01:13:58.831 --> 01:14:03.120
nature free men.
So it's helpful,

1046
01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:06.300
and this is a form of ethnocentric stuff,

1047
01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:10.320
but that the Greeks were very,
very spelled it out very carefully,

1048
01:14:10.321 --> 01:14:12.280
thought about it carefully.
And,

1049
01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:16.390
<v 0>and,
and if you said,
well,
why do you say that?
Well,
they would my hole too.</v>

1050
01:14:16.810 --> 01:14:20.800
Deep down.
They might hold what we would call sort of racial prejudices,

1051
01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:23.890
but I think they would have made a better case for it.

1052
01:14:23.891 --> 01:14:27.520
They would have said to be a free man,
as Aristotle said,

1053
01:14:27.521 --> 01:14:32.521
you need to live in a bolus because that's the only place it's possible to live

1054
01:14:32.591 --> 01:14:33.424
as a free man.

1055
01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:38.520
So because Greeks chose to live in polies day are free people who choose to live

1056
01:14:39.610 --> 01:14:43.270
as the slaves of monarchs and tyrants.

1057
01:14:43.630 --> 01:14:48.580
That's because they are natural slaves.
And that prejudice is very deep.

1058
01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:52.810
And so when the Greeks fend up having to fight the Persians,

1059
01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:57.640
there's all a lot more going on than just we're being invaded and we have to

1060
01:14:57.910 --> 01:15:00.770
defend our land next time.

1061
01:15:00.771 --> 01:15:04.570
I look at the great exception to all of the things we've been talking about.

1062
01:15:04.571 --> 01:15:07.240
Sparta,
the state like no of the Greek state.
