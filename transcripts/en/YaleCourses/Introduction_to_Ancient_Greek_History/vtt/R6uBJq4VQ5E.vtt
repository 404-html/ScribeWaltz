00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.600
Last time I was talking to you about the the world of Homer from the side of you

2
00:00:08.471 --> 00:00:13.471
might say the life of the mind rather than the practical matters of society.

3
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.790
Talking about values and ethics in the world of Homer and I spoke to you.

4
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.850
<v 1>About the heroic ethic which is excuse me the dominant element in this system of</v>

5
00:00:30.971 --> 00:00:31.804
theirs.

6
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.020
Another way of looking at it is that it is an aristocratic way of thinking and

7
00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:47.391
feeling at the core of it is the concept of a red Tay A.R.

8
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.423
E.T..

9
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.950
Now that's a word that causes us some problems because it comes to mean in.

10
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.430
Even in antiquity it comes to mean something quite different and especially if

11
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.680
you're talking about Christianity which adopts the word as well when it comes to

12
00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:13.681
mean goodness goodness in a kind of a Christian sense will erase all of those

13
00:01:14.861 --> 00:01:19.861
ideas from your head when you think about the world of Homer and I would say the

14
00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:26.281
world of Greece in the period we're studying at our state derives from the Greek

15
00:01:28.031 --> 00:01:32.410
word on there which means man man as opposed to woman.

16
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.520
These are the masculine qualities as the Greeks saw them and primary among them

17
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.000
was the idea of courage.

18
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.810
Physical courage moral courage mental courage many mainly courage in battle is

19
00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:56.140
the most core.

20
00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.680
<v 2>Aspect of this word this idea which comes to spread and to be much more</v>

21
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.730
encompassing than that.

22
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.360
The idea I guess the most neutral way to translate the word is excellence

23
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.330
prowess the ability to do something or to be something which is admired in the

24
00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:23.570
fullest way possible.

25
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.400
Some of the desired qualities some of the examples of outright they are.

26
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.240
Courage as I've said.
But also beauty

27
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.740
strength the ability to perform athletics very well but also to speak very well.

28
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.310
And it is one of the extraordinary things I think for modern people to see.

29
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.210
There are really two central heroes in the poems of Homer Achilles the great

30
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.480
central figure of the Iliad who represents physical courage strength power

31
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.510
beauty speed all of those things Odysseus and the hare of the Odyssey but

32
00:03:10.941 --> 00:03:13.280
present and very important in both poems.

33
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.860
He also got all of these things but the thing that sets him apart that makes him

34
00:03:18.861 --> 00:03:23.861
the special kind of hero he is is his skill in speech which doesn't mean only

35
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.120
that he pronounces words very well or that he selects them very well for beauty

36
00:03:32.331 --> 00:03:36.680
or something but rather that he is enormously clever.

37
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.310
That he can use speech to achieve practical ends just as he uses strength and

38
00:03:46.761 --> 00:03:48.770
power and all those other things.

39
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.250
And the Greeks regard in the Homer's world seem to regard one just about as well

40
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.410
as they do the other.

41
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.400
Odysseus is the man the wily Odysseus as Homer calls him the man of many devices

42
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.500
all of those things are are great.

43
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.160
And they are equally honored along with the physical courage that is so

44
00:04:15.261 --> 00:04:19.580
characteristic of these guys
and

45
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.910
the recognition of that those qualities the recognition of the red tie that

46
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:31.300
these heroes have is what their lives are all about.

47
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.590
First of all they have to have these qualities.
It's not enough.

48
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.950
They must be recognized by the people among whom they lived by the communities

49
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.960
in which they live and the highest.

50
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.710
Rewards that individuals can have is the recognition of their fellow men of

51
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:56.650
their very very high qualities.
We are talking about.

52
00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.640
A society therefore.

53
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.150
The anthropologists have come up with I think a useful distinction.

54
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.780
Societies based on shame as opposed to those that practice guilt guilt is

55
00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:16.651
something very internal and personal shame is something very external and public

56
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.360
and how you are treated and greeted

57
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.280
is what makes your worth and so it is from the beginning.

58
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.340
A society in which the community is a critical element may be the critical

59
00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:37.531
element an individual who didn't live in a society could not achieve the kinds

60
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.110
of glory and fame and recognition that you expect from a hero.

61
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.710
And all of these heroes are aristocrats in the traditional sense of the word.

62
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.490
They arrive at their high standing in their community by virtue of birth.

63
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.870
You are born to be one of these people because your father was such a person

64
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.440
belonging to the right families and so on to noble families of Greece.

65
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.160
And we see it already in Homer typically claim descent from some god or other.

66
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.510
And ordinary people do not have that ability.

67
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:31.110
The family and the individual are the critical elements a larger community

68
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.550
meaning your entire village or entire city your entire region that is barely

69
00:06:41.231 --> 00:06:41.740
mentioned.

70
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.980
<v 3>That is not talked about again.</v>

71
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.380
Think about Achilles when he refuses to do what he is supposed to wear.

72
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.790
But he has to fight with the Greeks because he's had to fight with Agamemnon.

73
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.700
Nobody says wait a minute.
That's treason.

74
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.370
You can't do that.

75
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.440
You've been signed up by your city or by this expedition to fight and you've got

76
00:07:01.441 --> 00:07:02.274
to fight.

77
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.320
Nobody says that what they say is Oh please we need you Achilles you mustn't do

78
00:07:07.721 --> 00:07:11.800
this.
But nobody says Arrest that man.

79
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.780
He has broken his debt.

80
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.820
He's not performing his debt to the community.
Everybody knows.

81
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.540
All those heroes are there because they want to be and they want to be there so

82
00:07:24.551 --> 00:07:26.860
that they can earn both the.

83
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.400
<v 2>Wealth that can be taken from a defeated city.</v>

84
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:36.660
But even more important the kind of fame and glory that comes with such deeds

85
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:38.570
and you are it.

86
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.850
I've already told you the story about Achilles having the choice of living

87
00:07:42.851 --> 00:07:47.851
forever without fame or dying with fame and he makes the choice for death and

88
00:07:48.821 --> 00:07:51.370
fame.
That I think is very critical.

89
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.250
That attitude that point of view even after the world of Homer is gone.

90
00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:02.620
He remains a very powerful influence on the Greeks throughout the rest of their

91
00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:04.274
history.

92
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:10.450
<v 4>So that you have built into that society an inherent conflict.</v>

93
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.100
After all even these heroes need communities in which to live for all the

94
00:08:16.101 --> 00:08:18.980
various purposes that human beings do.

95
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.350
So you would think they have to have some allegiance to them.
They do.

96
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:29.470
But they also have an allegiance to their families and to themselves.

97
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.410
Which in Homer tend to predominate.

98
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.860
And yet there is a sense in which the conflict is very real.

99
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.690
If you look at the problem in Homer

100
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:48.340
Achilles when he withdraws and refuses to fight for the Army nobody can tell him

101
00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:49.100
to do otherwise.

102
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:54.100
He has a right to do that but that means that something is wrong and it's very

103
00:08:55.551 --> 00:09:00.551
clear that he has been overcome by rage and he is not behaving in the sensible

104
00:09:01.911 --> 00:09:04.880
way that even a Greek hero is supposed to.

105
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:10.130
And he is not brought back to normal to a position in which people can say yes

106
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.300
well you're a great hero and you're not out of your mind because when that

107
00:09:14.301 --> 00:09:19.301
happens when he gives up his rage and he allows you remember Prime to bury his

108
00:09:21.081 --> 00:09:24.650
son Hector something he would have refused to do in his rage.

109
00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:30.340
So that even a killings has got to come to terms with the community norms in

110
00:09:31.491 --> 00:09:33.110
order to be living in a proper life.

111
00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:38.140
And this conflict between his family and private desires and needs and those of

112
00:09:38.571 --> 00:09:43.571
the community will be characteristic very strongly of the Greek way of life for

113
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.880
the rest of its history not always in precisely this same form but it will be

114
00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:54.650
their competition again is rearing its head.

115
00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:00.200
<v 1>It's another form of competition the competition between these two sources of</v>

116
00:10:00.201 --> 00:10:00.830
value.

117
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:05.830
<v 4>The community at large versus the individual and the family and this kind of</v>

118
00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:13.191
tension which doesn't make it clear the rules are not absolute.

119
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:15.930
Not everybody fits into a pigeon hole.

120
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:20.310
It is not easy to say what is the right thing.
What is the wrong thing.

121
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.670
<v 5>All of that creates confusion problems but also amnio conflict tension</v>

122
00:10:29.601 --> 00:10:30.980
competition all those things.

123
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:36.370
But it also creates a degree of freedom which doesn't permit the typical

124
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:41.680
despotic kind of culture which characterizes almost all of the human experiences

125
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.490
that we know in the early history of the human race.

126
00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:53.460
<v 1>So there is I want to turn now to the way in which this way of thinking had an</v>

127
00:10:56.471 --> 00:10:58.330
impact on the future.

128
00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.650
And of course I'm speaking about the future of the of Western civilization which

129
00:11:02.651 --> 00:11:04.990
was the heir to this tradition.

130
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:11.190
I mentioned to you already last time that in a way the poems are a kind of a

131
00:11:12.311 --> 00:11:12.880
Bible.

132
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.870
It is the source of all knowledge and wisdom that anybody who knows anything

133
00:11:16.871 --> 00:11:21.871
knows and and how they were used for practical purposes as when the Spartans

134
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.940
made a decision about who owns Salloum is based on what it said in the Iliad.

135
00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:34.530
But it's also important to realize how those poems inspired the imagination of

136
00:11:36.491 --> 00:11:38.620
Greeks for the rest of their history.

137
00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:44.610
Another fact is that we are told that when Alexander the Great went out to

138
00:11:44.681 --> 00:11:49.000
conquer the Persian Empire and as far as he was concerned to conquer everything

139
00:11:49.001 --> 00:11:51.670
he could reach.
He carried with him.

140
00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:57.040
A copy of The Iliad which it is alleged he put under his pillow.

141
00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.640
This is a problem when you consider that books in those days were not likely to

142
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:05.641
be Codex as courtesies as they are today but scrolls that took up quite a lot of

143
00:12:06.311 --> 00:12:10.750
space.
I don't know quite how Alex managed it but that's what they say.

144
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:15.880
But the principle is established it was clear he was another Achilles in his own

145
00:12:15.881 --> 00:12:20.881
eyes and it was for him to achieve the great deeds that I have been mentioning

146
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.333
now.

147
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.800
<v 6>If you look at the story of Western civilization it provides a very interesting</v>

148
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:38.410
contrast within it and the I'm sorry the Greek experience that I'm talking about

149
00:12:40.561 --> 00:12:45.561
now based upon what you see in Homer provides a contrast with and a competition

150
00:12:45.751 --> 00:12:49.620
to the other great tradition of Western civilization which is the

151
00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:51.630
Judeo-Christian tradition.

152
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.600
<v 1>And I just want to make a few small points to indicate how that works</v>

153
00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.640
the Iliad begins.

154
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:04.700
<v 2>The first word in the Iliad is the accusative now Main in its wrath anger I am</v>

155
00:13:08.341 --> 00:13:13.341
singing about the wrath the anger of Achilles which brought so many men to their

156
00:13:14.341 --> 00:13:19.341
doom is what Homer says the first thing is the emotion of an individual man.

157
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.560
The odyssey begins even more strikingly with the word undrawn.

158
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:33.060
The accusative on there the the accusative case of a man and he says Sing to me

159
00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.480
God is about that man.

160
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:43.350
That man of many devices that that clever man Odysseus the need of Virgil based

161
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:51.600
of course on the Iliad The Odyssey begins Armagh we room Kwa Colonel I sing of

162
00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.970
arms and the man.

163
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:03.480
<v 7>The man in is now that's what did the Greeks took talking about.</v>

164
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:09.090
I'm talking about individual men extraordinary men and the events that emerge

165
00:14:09.681 --> 00:14:12.550
from them and the life they lead.

166
00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:18.270
Well let's look at our Bible begins this will be news to most of you

167
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:24.910
in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth and it the book goes

168
00:14:29.671 --> 00:14:32.230
right on to talk about God.

169
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.690
What he does sometimes why he does it.

170
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.490
What is the effect of what he does.

171
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.370
But the center of our.

172
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:46.110
Book is God not man.

173
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.070
<v 6>And there's some that there's not just an accident that reveals the</v>

174
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.690
characteristic of each one of these cultures.

175
00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:58.570
The Greeks had a humanistic outlook on life.

176
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.630
They believed in the gods.
They were religious people.

177
00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:07.020
But the core of their lives was shaped by things human in a way different from

178
00:15:09.191 --> 00:15:13.420
what was true of the Hebrews and the Christians later on

179
00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.450
versus a divine view.

180
00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:21.510
The secular approach is very very Greek versus a religious approach the Greek

181
00:15:25.031 --> 00:15:26.500
view.
Moreover.

182
00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:32.470
<v 7>Presupposes that man lives in society.</v>

183
00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:38.070
He is not a creature off by himself by definition.

184
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.460
<v 6>He necessarily lives in society.</v>

185
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:48.030
He is conceivable to the Greeks only in a society the Iliad which is about a

186
00:15:50.141 --> 00:15:50.974
war.

187
00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:58.150
<v 2>Immediately is a kind of an artificial society put together for the purpose of</v>

188
00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.640
defeating the Trojans and taking their city.

189
00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:06.370
As I've said suggested to you the values that are the most important are

190
00:16:06.371 --> 00:16:07.780
community values.

191
00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:13.170
<v 6>That is to say the reward of good behavior is the admiration and the honor that</v>

192
00:16:14.621 --> 00:16:19.621
a hero gets and the most serious punishment he can suffer is to be shamed in

193
00:16:22.391 --> 00:16:27.391
front of that community Aristotle late writing late in the Greek tradition but

194
00:16:29.001 --> 00:16:34.001
still powerfully influenced by these kinds of ideas speaks about man as a Greek

195
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:41.110
words are a political zone and I think the best way to understand that is to

196
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:46.810
think of it as meaning man is a creature who lives in a place in a city state

197
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:55.150
and a Greek kind of a city state and and in the same general passage he says a

198
00:16:57.731 --> 00:17:02.731
man who is by nature without a Polis is either more or less than a man and what

199
00:17:06.591 --> 00:17:11.591
he means by that is if a man is superior to the polls doesn't need a polis he is

200
00:17:11.691 --> 00:17:14.410
a god because men need a policy.

201
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:19.460
And if he is beneath the polls it means he's beneath what it is to be a human

202
00:17:19.461 --> 00:17:24.461
being and that tells you just how potent is this concept of the community for

203
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:31.700
the Greeks and it emerges in its own way from the Iliad and The Odyssey

204
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:39.470
Odysseus also was offered an opportunity to live forever when he was shipwrecked

205
00:17:41.371 --> 00:17:46.371
on the island in which the goddess Calypso ruled she fell in love with Odysseus.

206
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:47.850
This

207
00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:49.710
<v 2>is the fate of great heroes.</v>

208
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.920
They are heroic and handsome and fast and women love them and she says just stay

209
00:17:57.951 --> 00:18:01.640
with me and you will live forever and all will be well.

210
00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:06.540
And he says well you're a very beautiful girl and I enjoy you a lot but.

211
00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:08.960
I've got to go back to Erica

212
00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:14.800
now why does he have to go back to ethics.
Well he has a wife.

213
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:20.360
And he whom he loves Penelope and he has a son whom he has barely seen because

214
00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:23.880
he had to go off to Troy.

215
00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:29.550
Almost 20 years ago and to fight that battle and he hasn't been home since.

216
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:34.330
Those are very powerful pulls that we easily do understand.

217
00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.530
But it's also true that he is the king in Ithaca.

218
00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:44.160
And when he returns to Africa he immediately moves into a position of honor and

219
00:18:45.701 --> 00:18:50.701
respect which is a critical part of his own sense of himself of the of what he

220
00:18:52.751 --> 00:18:55.420
needs to be what he wants to be.

221
00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.830
And so and I always think it's very very interesting too.

222
00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:02.350
We don't have in American society we don't have an alien an odyssey.

223
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.910
We don't have our own Bible.

224
00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:09.330
But I think Mark Twain's Huck Finn is really very very revealing to see what is

225
00:19:12.191 --> 00:19:17.191
so different about us in the modern times from the Homeric world.

226
00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:23.850
Huck is when things don't go right for Huck what does he do.

227
00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:28.720
He lights out and wants to get away from society.

228
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:34.110
<v 4>He wants to go wandering and exploring and on his way almost.</v>

229
00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:39.580
And as an individual rejecting society fleeing for his individualism and that

230
00:19:40.871 --> 00:19:43.630
tradition as you all know what.

231
00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:47.470
How many examples can we think of it of works that.

232
00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:54.260
<v 7>Really project the greatness of being all by yourself and away from people and</v>

233
00:19:54.991 --> 00:19:59.110
away from society.
That's where good things are.

234
00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:04.170
The Greeks would have thought you were out of your mind they or that you were

235
00:20:04.171 --> 00:20:06.910
some kind of a barbarian.
But that's OK.

236
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:11.720
People have never known civil society people have never known a world of polio.

237
00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.430
<v 1>Well of course they would do something stupid like that.</v>

238
00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:18.630
But I think that's an interesting contrast.

239
00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:24.940
Let me carry on with this by talking about the views of society which are

240
00:20:24.941 --> 00:20:28.570
characteristic of the two traditions in Western civilization.

241
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:33.430
What do we see in the Bible when God decides to invent man.

242
00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:39.090
He places him in the garden of Eden the garden of eden contains first of all

243
00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.170
just Adam.

244
00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.110
<v 7>And then when God decides for his own reasons</v>

245
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:52.200
that he needs a companion he invents one other companion.

246
00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.950
Eve and where they live his paradise.

247
00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:02.180
One man one woman.
That's all you need.
It's great.

248
00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.010
Nothing could ever be so good.

249
00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:08.980
Well what happens they are transgress.

250
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:15.750
Eve persuade persuaded by them serpent then persuades Adam.

251
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:19.050
<v 2>To do what it was forbidden by God.
What is forbidden by God.</v>

252
00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:24.620
It is to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge because if human beings obtain

253
00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.700
knowledge they will be like the gods.

254
00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:32.220
<v 7>And that is unacceptable.</v>

255
00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:35.430
So when you do that you have to be punished.

256
00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:40.790
What is punishment to be thrown out of Eden to be thrown out of this isolated

257
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:46.230
condition of perfection by what is perfection.
You don't have to work.

258
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.260
You can eat without doing anything about it.

259
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:52.050
You don't seem to do much of anything which is fine.

260
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:56.490
Everything is quiet peaceful.
No problems no action.

261
00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:02.130
That's paradise.
A Greek would go crazy at the thought.

262
00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:07.480
It is a pre social a pre political life.

263
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:13.040
Life in society which then is what Adam and Eve have to encounter.

264
00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:18.410
They now have to have form villages cities start living among each other and so

265
00:22:18.411 --> 00:22:19.244
on.

266
00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:24.340
That is the punishment for the sin of seeking knowledge of good and evil and

267
00:22:25.041 --> 00:22:28.460
therefore of straining for divinity

268
00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:30.913
man.

269
00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:35.920
The message I think is must know his place which is humble and not close to

270
00:22:37.941 --> 00:22:42.690
divine his hope rests simply with God.

271
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:48.350
Not with himself when he tries to take things into his own hands and in the

272
00:22:51.731 --> 00:22:53.950
process to contravene the will of God.

273
00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:57.460
Only terrible things can happen to him.

274
00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:02.030
It's very interesting I think that in the 18th century Rousseau.

275
00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:07.810
<v 3>Who himself seems to me to have been kind of like a poisoned apple in the</v>

276
00:23:08.151 --> 00:23:09.320
history of the human race.

277
00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:15.410
Oddly it revives that biblical view if you think about it.

278
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:20.840
His view is man was happy and good before the invention of society which society

279
00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:27.630
corrupts man and takes away from him his happiness.

280
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:34.160
What we need to do is to undo the evils that organized society have done and if

281
00:23:36.211 --> 00:23:41.211
only we removed all of the bad things created by society man would return to his

282
00:23:41.221 --> 00:23:46.221
naturally perfect virtuous self which is of course a major source.

283
00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:48.443
Of.

284
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:53.600
<v 2>Individualism which is this great Western Force and the nihilism that I think</v>

285
00:23:56.371 --> 00:23:59.250
inevitably emerges from it.

286
00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:04.640
I think people have in different ways found in Rousseau the root both of a

287
00:24:06.901 --> 00:24:11.901
Nietzsche and nihilism and of Marx and I think there is powerful reason to do so

288
00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:20.780
because you can go in either one of those directions once you start making this

289
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:22.590
kind of assumption.

290
00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:29.180
For the Greeks on the other hand as I've said political society was essential

291
00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:32.820
for living any kind of a good life.

292
00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:38.430
And the oddest thing you remember Odysseus finds himself.

293
00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:45.160
On the island of the Cyclops those one eyed monsters and what is it about them

294
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:51.880
that make them so monstrous so inhuman from the perspective of the Homeric

295
00:24:52.281 --> 00:24:53.114
heroes.

296
00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:58.210
And here's the line that Homer writes They live without.

297
00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:03.460
The word is the Greek word is normally which we would translate as laws but

298
00:25:04.041 --> 00:25:08.900
before they become laws they are the customary norms of society.

299
00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:14.050
In other words civilization they live without Nimoy and they wreck not of one

300
00:25:14.871 --> 00:25:18.140
another.
That is to say.
Each family lives by itself.

301
00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:22.340
They have nothing to do with each other.
They do not have a community.

302
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.490
They do not have a society so they are of course.

303
00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:31.010
Sort of prehistoric monsters.
As far as the Greeks are concerned

304
00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:33.813
now.

305
00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:39.960
<v 5>The Judeo-Christian story as I think of it by the way the word story is a</v>

306
00:25:41.201 --> 00:25:46.201
translation or it means the same thing as the Greek word mythos.

307
00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:52.080
Our word myth a myth in this sense as the Greeks it's just a tale.

308
00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:56.550
It can be true it can be false and so on anyway.

309
00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:02.040
The Judeo Christian story says in the beginning men were innocent.

310
00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:08.550
Innocent was the same as ignorant because knowledge gets in the way of their

311
00:26:10.361 --> 00:26:13.360
innocence and they have solitude.

312
00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:18.810
Living in paradise what destroys their happy permanent condition is the sin of

313
00:26:22.921 --> 00:26:27.921
pride and the consequence of that sin is society corruption.

314
00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:36.360
<v 2>Pain and death because they knew neither of these needed pain or death while</v>

315
00:26:36.401 --> 00:26:41.401
they were in heathen salvation is available and with it immortality.

316
00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:47.230
But it comes from God.
And it doesn't come in the world in which we live.

317
00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:52.710
But in some other world to be achieved in the future that I think is a very

318
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:57.000
thumbnail sketch of the Judeo Christian story.

319
00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:01.450
<v 8>The Greek story is quite different.
War.</v>

320
00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:07.220
Pig is right at the center of it and war itself requires political and social

321
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:10.023
organization.

322
00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:15.210
There can be fighting without war but there can be no war without an

323
00:27:15.251 --> 00:27:19.780
organization that makes it something more than just plain fighting.

324
00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:23.890
It requires political and social organization.

325
00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:29.970
<v 7>The search for honor and glory are at the roots of why men fight</v>

326
00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.440
and why they do many many other things in their lives.

327
00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:43.560
<v 2>According to this view the Greeks did have a notion that in a way resembles some</v>

328
00:27:44.571 --> 00:27:47.180
of the things I said about the Judeo-Christian story.

329
00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:53.080
They had a concept called Hubris h y Bahrain is to be translated as something

330
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:59.830
but among these terms excess arrogance violence.

331
00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:05.590
I think the fullest grasp of it I think might be rendered best by violent

332
00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:06.453
arrogance.

333
00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:12.060
<v 6>Some notion of being above yourself and thinking yourself more than a man with</v>

334
00:28:12.701 --> 00:28:17.290
the implication that you are approaching some kind of divinity by being more

335
00:28:17.291 --> 00:28:22.291
than a man and acting accordingly which usually requires that you use violence

336
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:28.590
to achieve what you want and the sort of the standard picture in Greek ethics

337
00:28:30.041 --> 00:28:32.770
runs this way.
A man is.

338
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:39.090
Granted too much.
He is too well off he is too rich.

339
00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:44.120
<v 9>He is too strong is too beautiful so much so that he becomes too arrogant and is</v>

340
00:28:48.031 --> 00:28:50.340
ready to step beyond his human condition.

341
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:55.910
At that point the gods don't like it because like the judeo christian god they

342
00:28:57.271 --> 00:28:59.310
want to have some boundary between the two.

343
00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:03.120
But for them it's very important because it's not the boundary is far from
clear.

344
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:07.290
So what happens to the man who has too much.

345
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:12.150
He is afflicted with the hubris which leads him to take the violent action onto

346
00:29:12.151 --> 00:29:17.010
the scene comes to God as arty ATV which might be translated.

347
00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:22.160
Moral blindness in other words he no longer can think straight and so he will do

348
00:29:22.561 --> 00:29:27.561
something dangerous harmful and very ultimately bad for himself.

349
00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:35.060
And when he does whatever it is he is struck by nemesis the goddess of

350
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.200
retribution.

351
00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:42.210
Well of course the most famous Greek case I think of these things is in

352
00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:47.270
Sophocles play Oedipus the King which illustrates that perfectly well.

353
00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:49.470
Oedipus is a brilliant man.

354
00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:53.430
He achieves the kingship of his city because of his extraordinarily

355
00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:56.490
extraordinary intelligence and he is a very good man.

356
00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:01.470
<v 10>He is king.
Don't imagine that he is a despot.
Anything but the people love him.</v>

357
00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:05.490
He saved the city thanks to his brilliance and his goodwill.

358
00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:11.180
However after a while he comes to be too satisfied too comfortable with his own

359
00:30:12.361 --> 00:30:13.230
brilliance.

360
00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:18.740
And when another threat comes to the city he is confident that he can solve the

361
00:30:19.681 --> 00:30:21.870
problem again for his people.

362
00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:27.020
His worn by the gods through seers and by men of wisdom saying Don't don't don't

363
00:30:28.561 --> 00:30:32.730
investigate this question too far you might be making a mistake.
He won't listen.

364
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:37.750
<v 8>He pulls ahead and he discovers in the process the terrible terrible truth which</v>

365
00:30:39.961 --> 00:30:44.961
is that by accident by coincidence not by intent but that as a young man he

366
00:30:46.891 --> 00:30:50.730
killed his father and subsequently married his mother.

367
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:56.300
And this most horrible of combinations of facts drives him and he's already

368
00:30:58.051 --> 00:31:03.051
suffered from the hubris and the RTA and the retribution is terrible in his what

369
00:31:06.291 --> 00:31:07.800
to say and his madness.

370
00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:12.850
When he discovers that he tears out his own eyes and blinds himself and of

371
00:31:13.581 --> 00:31:17.900
course now for the rest of his life he must just go about as a kind of a beggar.

372
00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:21.440
Having been this form a tremendously great king.

373
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:27.190
So these are examples of what happens in Greek ethics later on if you are guilty

374
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.680
of this characteristic.

375
00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:39.820
<v 10>On the other hand when he even Oedipus himself when he understands and he</v>

376
00:31:41.411 --> 00:31:45.850
relents and in a sense he apologizes for what he's done.

377
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:50.680
But more importantly he ceases of course to be powerful and to act in that way.

378
00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:56.050
Wisdom comes to him.
He understands.
He has acted in moderately.

379
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:58.030
That is the critical concept.

380
00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:03.300
Moderation is this wonderfully great important thing for the Greeks.

381
00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:07.390
You must act in moderation.
Don't be.

382
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:11.830
They don't ask you to just be humble and throw yourself on the ground and

383
00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:16.480
consider yourself as nothing compared to the God or the gods.

384
00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:21.340
<v 2>Be a man be proud of what you should be proud of.</v>

385
00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:26.850
But don't go beyond limit of what is human because if you do terrible things

386
00:32:28.331 --> 00:32:33.250
will come.
Seek fame.
We all want that.
And I'll say more about that.

387
00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:37.330
But you can't push it too far.

388
00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:42.510
<v 9>There has to be some kind of reasonable human limit to what you do.</v>

389
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:47.090
So here is this problem.

390
00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:52.670
It's typically Greek problem where there is a contradiction that you've got to

391
00:32:52.671 --> 00:32:53.504
live with.

392
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:58.600
You can't resolve you as if you want to seek the fullness of a human experience.

393
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:04.360
You have to try to be the best possible man the greatest possible man to compete

394
00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:10.840
successfully against others and to achieve fame glory and recognition for what

395
00:33:11.421 --> 00:33:13.880
you've achieved.
But if you push it too far.

396
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:18.860
You will anger the gods and something terrible will happen to you.

397
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:21.463
So.

398
00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:26.650
<v 5>It seems to me that Western civilization ever since has been a composite of</v>

399
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:34.300
these two traditions but there is no way to put them together.

400
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:40.930
And so Western civilization is an ambiguous society with a war always ranging

401
00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:46.750
within the soul of Western civilization.

402
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:52.930
And it's never perfectly clear which of the two approaches to life.

403
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:55.910
Is the better one.

404
00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.960
I don't know whether any of you have ever thought about this and anything like

405
00:33:59.961 --> 00:34:03.560
this way but if you contemplate your own

406
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:09.860
way of thinking about what you what are you supposed to be doing with your life

407
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:15.490
I think you'll find some combination if you're a sort of typical but that

408
00:34:16.491 --> 00:34:21.470
combination doesn't ever have to be 50/50 and I'm sure it very rarely is more

409
00:34:21.471 --> 00:34:25.970
typically one aspect of the culture dominates rather than the other.

410
00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:32.320
But the shifts in place and time and in many I would say throughout most human

411
00:34:33.381 --> 00:34:36.220
beings there is a consciousness of both.

412
00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:40.130
<v 9>They both have some attraction and one has to grapple with them.</v>

413
00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:44.960
So they're part of you wants to become the greatest whatever it is that you want

414
00:34:44.961 --> 00:34:45.794
to become.

415
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:51.190
And you wouldn't be here if you weren't very competitive and very eager to come

416
00:34:51.681 --> 00:34:52.514
out first

417
00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:59.110
devoted to retain your own version of that kind of thing and yet.

418
00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:04.640
<v 11>It's very easy to say to you that's not a good thing to do.</v>

419
00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.640
That's what you should try to do is to be humble.

420
00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:13.180
You should be like what Jesus suggests in the Sermon on the mount.

421
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:20.950
There's your soul is in deep danger if you indeed continue to lead the life that

422
00:35:22.191 --> 00:35:24.290
you have mainly been leading up to now.

423
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:29.720
<v 2>And those two things are in conflict where I don't give you ever go to church</v>

424
00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:35.380
that is no longer confined to a religious organization.

425
00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:40.310
<v 5>Those are key parts float around in Western civilization all the time.</v>

426
00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:45.800
There are aspects of.
Demand for performance at the highest level.

427
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:51.050
At the same time as there's a great deal of blaming people for pursuing such

428
00:35:51.051 --> 00:35:56.051
things instead of humility that's Western civilization friends and the Greeks

429
00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:00.740
are at the root of the whole thing.

430
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:07.750
So now let me turn to my next topic which is to leave the world of Homer behind

431
00:36:10.231 --> 00:36:15.231
us and to begin to tell the story of how it was that the characteristic unit of

432
00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:23.520
Greek civilization the Poles came into being out of the dark ages.

433
00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:29.340
We've said a little bit about the let me say a little bit first of all about the

434
00:36:29.421 --> 00:36:31.790
way scholars have categorized.

435
00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:37.840
The history of Greece typically we speak of the bronze it Bronze Age the Meissen

436
00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:42.220
the period and so on followed by the Dark Ages.

437
00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:47.250
But after that you start having refined terms which derive actually excuse me

438
00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:50.900
from the world of the history of art.

439
00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:56.140
And that is because in the dark ages we don't have any writing.

440
00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:59.290
So if you want to designate anything it has to be by.

441
00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:06.140
Tangible things like pottery particularly painted pottery when you have it

442
00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:10.860
because it's easier to categorize and it's from that that most of our terms show

443
00:37:10.861 --> 00:37:10.980
up.

444
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:15.980
So for instance you will see references to words like proto geometric post and

445
00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:22.420
they'll be sort of post my in then proto geometric.

446
00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:27.660
<v 12>These would be the very earliest kinds of pots that have geometric designs on</v>

447
00:37:27.821 --> 00:37:28.510
them.

448
00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:33.510
Then comes the geometric period and the Orientalism period all of these refer to

449
00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:40.680
pottery styles but there is then next come to a larger period which is referred

450
00:37:43.301 --> 00:37:45.760
to as the Archaic Period

451
00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.940
archaic Visa V.

452
00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:54.060
The classical period which is this big start was the central subject of people's

453
00:37:55.511 --> 00:37:59.860
interest in the Greeks to begin with and later on they studied its surrounding

454
00:37:59.861 --> 00:38:04.861
periods in this archaic period is roughly speaking about 750 B.C. to 500 B.C.

455
00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:14.390
why this period as a unit what makes it a unit.

456
00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:19.420
<v 5>Well it's around 750 a great number of the changes that move the Greeks away</v>

457
00:38:21.951 --> 00:38:26.810
from the dark age kind of society to the full scale Poles begin.

458
00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:29.150
And five hundred.

459
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:33.440
Because really I would have said if you were being more a little bit more

460
00:38:33.441 --> 00:38:35.300
precise you would say something like.

461
00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:41.810
<v 12>Well no even 500 isn't really bad because if you think about the Persian Wars as</v>

462
00:38:41.811 --> 00:38:46.610
being the breaking point before the Persian Wars you're in the archaic period

463
00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.460
after the Persian Wars you're in the classical period.

464
00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:54.730
Well the Persian Wars begin in four ninety nine B.C. when my latest starts the

465
00:38:55.791 --> 00:38:59.810
Ionian rebellion.
So that's really I think the reason for the dating

466
00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:06.840
during this archaic periods some of the things that happen are these the

467
00:39:06.971 --> 00:39:11.971
isolation of the Greek towns in the dark age gives way increasingly to contact

468
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:17.740
with the East and the South.

469
00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:23.040
<v 5>When I say the South I really mean Egypt and all around the eastern Aegean Sea</v>

470
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:32.390
the rise of the poles is based upon critical economic military social and

471
00:39:35.521 --> 00:39:40.521
political changes all of which produce a world that's really strikingly

472
00:39:40.891 --> 00:39:43.290
different from the one that was just before

473
00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:49.980
I suppose the first apparently historical event that we know something about is

474
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.970
the.

475
00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:56.970
The first Olympic Games which according to Greek tradition were held in 776 B.C.

476
00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:05.880
the precision of that of course is not to be taken seriously but it gives you a

477
00:40:06.311 --> 00:40:09.070
general idea of when we are talking about

478
00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:16.650
and the fact this is what's interesting about that is that the Olympic games

479
00:40:16.751 --> 00:40:21.010
like all of the pan hellenic games it was the first of the pan hellenic games

480
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:26.520
was not a local event just for one policy and maybe for a couple it was one to

481
00:40:27.281 --> 00:40:32.110
which all the people who thought of themselves as Helen's which we would call

482
00:40:32.111 --> 00:40:34.630
Greeks took part in.

483
00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:39.690
<v 13>So that meant the concept that there is something that all of us are have in</v>

484
00:40:39.881 --> 00:40:44.700
common that make us all hellions now exists.
It's not there.

485
00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:45.923
<v 5>In Homer.</v>

486
00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:52.050
So that's one thing then literacy returns to the Greek world.

487
00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:58.450
It is as I told you before not a development of the Meissen in the script

488
00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:05.330
which we saw but rather a new writing system a true alphabet most of the symbols

489
00:41:09.891 --> 00:41:14.891
were borrowed from a kind of of a Semitic language and a Semitic alphabet that

490
00:41:16.671 --> 00:41:19.050
came from finished.

491
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:22.370
I would have guessed or someplace near it.

492
00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:25.010
I think I mentioned to you that the Greeks.

493
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:31.630
<v 14>Improved upon it made it a true alphabet by taking some signs that they didn't</v>

494
00:41:31.791 --> 00:41:36.320
need for their own language and turning them into vowel signs.

495
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:41.600
You know if you read a well good example of that kind of a Semitic script is

496
00:41:41.601 --> 00:41:46.280
Hebrew.
If you read the Biblical Hebrew you have to supply the vowels yourself.

497
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:50.660
You have to know where the vowels are supposed to go.
But from here.

498
00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:52.580
And that makes it harder to learn how to read.

499
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:56.570
Well when you have the vowel sounds it's easier and the Greeks made that

500
00:41:56.571 --> 00:42:01.550
contribution in one of Plato's lesser known dialogues.

501
00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:07.040
He makes a statement the following statement which I think shows both the

502
00:42:07.041 --> 00:42:10.520
typical arrogance of the Greeks and also says something true.

503
00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:16.420
<v 5>He says the Greeks never invented anything but everything they borrowed they</v>

504
00:42:18.301 --> 00:42:19.140
improved upon.

505
00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:25.210
I think they probably also invented a few things but it was very very

506
00:42:25.211 --> 00:42:30.211
characteristic of the Greeks to borrow from the cultures they encountered and to

507
00:42:31.061 --> 00:42:34.390
adapt them to make them more useful for their own purposes.

508
00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:39.250
And nothing could be clearer than that the alphabet is an example of that

509
00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:44.360
henceforth we will see writing in Greece now very very little of it.

510
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:50.050
<v 14>And of course what we have is confined to things that are not perishable.</v>

511
00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:55.250
These would have been inscriptions either on pottery which the earliest ones are

512
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:01.000
or on stone but otherwise I'm sure there was writing on perishable material

513
00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.100
wooden plaques.

514
00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:09.680
<v 5>Probably not yet paper but but these would have been destroyed.</v>

515
00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.230
So what we have is on the pottery.

516
00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:19.990
We know that the Greeks established the first the first colony of which we know

517
00:43:19.991 --> 00:43:24.910
the Greeks that the Greeks did establish it was in the Bay of Naples on the

518
00:43:24.911 --> 00:43:25.830
island of escape.

519
00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:31.560
They established a colony somewhere in the 7 fifties and soon afterwards there

520
00:43:33.951 --> 00:43:37.090
is a colony established on the east coast of Sicily.

521
00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:42.450
At what we call Syracuse now and a rash of others so that the Greeks are in the

522
00:43:44.081 --> 00:43:49.081
seven fifties engaged in spreading themselves from the mainland of Greece and

523
00:43:51.251 --> 00:43:56.251
from the Aegean in general even so far out west as Italy and Sicily and soon we

524
00:43:58.751 --> 00:44:03.751
know they are in touch with just about every place in the Mediterranean Sea in

525
00:44:05.651 --> 00:44:06.580
the same period.

526
00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:11.850
There is clear cut unmistakable Oriental influence on Greek pottery and other

527
00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:16.540
things that they make.

528
00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:23.040
What Oriental that means mainly the Tigris and Euphrates Mesopotamia Syria all

529
00:44:24.311 --> 00:44:28.900
those older civilizations and more and much more advanced civilizations and the

530
00:44:28.901 --> 00:44:33.901
Greek Greeks are in touch with them again and they borrow stylised copy styles

531
00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:39.460
maybe they in the early days maybe they used some of the craftsmen from out

532
00:44:39.461 --> 00:44:41.950
there or maybe they just their own craftsmen picked it up.

533
00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:44.650
However that may be no question about it.

534
00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:49.830
Contact interaction influence most of the influence I suspect was going one way

535
00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:56.010
in those days from the more advanced civilizations of the east to the Greeks the

536
00:44:56.591 --> 00:45:00.580
Greeks are doing a lot of learning borrowing and adopting

537
00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:07.500
and of course this is the period in which the Homeric epics are finally written

538
00:45:08.201 --> 00:45:13.201
down now that there is writing and that gives them I think even greater impact

539
00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:20.580
on the Greek world in the future all of these things are happening about the

540
00:45:20.811 --> 00:45:25.811
same time as there is a also happening a major fundamental change in farming.

541
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:32.120
Commerce and warfare.

542
00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:36.420
Which will have very significant political consequences as well.

543
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.500
But I want to postpone that story for a little while

544
00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:46.520
let me then just turn to this phenomenon that is the polls

545
00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:53.880
the polls the word poll this appears in Homer as early as Homer.

546
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:59.130
When it means something different from what it means throughout most of Greek

547
00:45:59.131 --> 00:46:04.131
history it just means a physical place and what it real appears to be is the

548
00:46:06.211 --> 00:46:11.211
citadel the fortress that was the center of the towns that grew up after the

549
00:46:13.111 --> 00:46:16.530
Bronze Age after the collapse of the Meissen mean world.

550
00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:22.070
So that's how it is in Homer later definitions however will be expansive and

551
00:46:23.701 --> 00:46:27.720
broad and as you go further and deeper into Greek history the claims become

552
00:46:27.721 --> 00:46:28.560
greater and greater.

553
00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:34.730
Aristotle in his politics of course tells us the most on this subject and often

554
00:46:36.031 --> 00:46:40.380
he is our source of information but one thing is clear and pretty early.

555
00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:45.830
The Polis is not merely a city state in the same way as let us say the

556
00:46:49.381 --> 00:46:54.381
Mesopotamian city states of the third millennium B.C. were places like or or

557
00:46:56.730 --> 00:47:01.730
Kish towns that we know back there those places were simply the place where the

558
00:47:04.491 --> 00:47:09.491
king or the emperor ruled the place where the main gods Palace was the place

559
00:47:13.191 --> 00:47:16.580
where the bureaucrats were to do their business.

560
00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:19.190
That's that's what it was.
No more than that.

561
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:25.150
But immediately very early you start hearing the Greeks talk about the palace in

562
00:47:25.461 --> 00:47:30.461
terms that are more in your mind than in in your chuch

563
00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:37.340
6th century Greek poet named Elsie is wrote.

564
00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:43.240
Not houses finally roofed or the stone of walls well-built built.

565
00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:51.190
No not canals or dockyards make the Poles but men able to use their opportunity

566
00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:02.420
and to get into the 5th century late in the fifth century facilities and as

567
00:48:02.491 --> 00:48:04.350
history has one of his.

568
00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:10.130
Generals speak to his men and say men are the poets.

569
00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:15.450
So we need to straighten out for ourselves what does that mean.

570
00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:20.550
Does that mean that the place where these people live is not the polls.

571
00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:21.690
Is it only men.

572
00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:27.650
Well we'll come back to that let me read you something as we move to the fullest

573
00:48:28.551 --> 00:48:33.551
claims that will be made for the role of the polis Aristotle in the politics.

574
00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:40.540
He says this as man is the best of the animals when perfected so he is the worst

575
00:48:44.381 --> 00:48:49.381
of all when he is divided away from law and justice but he tells us human

576
00:48:52.541 --> 00:48:57.541
justice can be found only in the polls because he says Man is by nature a

577
00:48:59.591 --> 00:49:04.591
politic con Zo on an animal of the polls and as I told you a man who is without

578
00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:11.410
a pulse by nature is above or below the category of man.

579
00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:17.360
Because man alone has the faculty of speech and the ability to distinguish good

580
00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:20.060
from bad and right from wrong.

581
00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:26.130
While he is born with weapons for the use of wisdom and virtue he may use them

582
00:49:27.101 --> 00:49:28.270
for the opposite ends.

583
00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:34.140
Therefore when he is without virtue man is the most savage of animals justice on

584
00:49:35.951 --> 00:49:40.951
the other hand is an element of the polls the administration of justice which

585
00:49:42.461 --> 00:49:47.461
means deciding what is just is the regulation of the partnership which is the

586
00:49:48.851 --> 00:49:52.690
polls man can't live without the polls.

587
00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:55.430
Justice exists only in the polls.

588
00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:59.600
The polls is something more than a place.

589
00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:04.900
It's more than the walls it's more than the ships is it is some kind of a thing

590
00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:07.280
that is spiritual.

591
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:08.503
<v 15>It seems to me</v>

592
00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:16.400
but about the size of this thing.

593
00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:21.780
Oh no maybe Becca there's something else I wanted to say to indicate this

594
00:50:22.661 --> 00:50:23.494
notion.

595
00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:28.060
<v 5>Of men being the polls as opposed to anything tangible.</v>

596
00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:35.820
When the Persians conquer the Greek cities of Asia Minor when they came to the

597
00:50:35.881 --> 00:50:37.650
coastal city of Fossey.

598
00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:41.400
The folks the four seasons had a choice.

599
00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:46.350
Of either giving bread and water to the great king and becoming subjects of the

600
00:50:46.351 --> 00:50:47.184
Persians.

601
00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:51.510
All would have meant what they would have had to pay taxes and do military

602
00:50:51.511 --> 00:50:54.990
service for the king.
He didn't go about killing people and conquer.

603
00:50:55.830 --> 00:51:00.830
They chose instead to take their city which is to say all the people in the city

604
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:06.960
put them on ships sail to the far west.

605
00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:10.950
And organize a new city out there.

606
00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:16.370
And in fact they landed on the Riviera in France and did pretty well for

607
00:51:16.531 --> 00:51:20.790
themselves afterwards.
But that's a beautiful example.

608
00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:25.110
They thought they had taken their polos with them because they had moved the

609
00:51:25.111 --> 00:51:29.790
entire city there during the Persian Wars.

610
00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:35.110
When Mr. Cleese is trying to convince his fellow Greeks to stay and fight at

611
00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:41.380
Selma's but they are reluctant to do so she says OK if you won't stay and fight

612
00:51:42.001 --> 00:51:46.740
it sounds well all our men are already located on our ships.

613
00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:52.100
We will take these ships sail them away to Italy and settle in Athens in Italy.

614
00:51:55.710 --> 00:52:00.710
Well the Spartans take them very seriously and they say OK we'll stay and fight

615
00:52:02.130 --> 00:52:06.680
at soundness so such a concept was a possibility.

616
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:13.860
It's not the whole story though.
Let me turn to the question of the physical.

617
00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:17.570
Picture that you ought to have of a pulse.

618
00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:22.860
Remember there is that Citadel standing on a high hill the Acropolis as it's

619
00:52:22.861 --> 00:52:27.780
called.
The Poles are high.
There is surrounding farmland

620
00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:31.350
going as far.

621
00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:36.920
Typically as there is either a natural or an artificial frontier typically a

622
00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:45.590
mountain range will be the boundary between the area of two poles or a stretch

623
00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:51.690
of water because Greece has to see winding through it everywhere.

624
00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:57.740
But when that's not true then there is a typical sort of modern frontier a a

625
00:52:58.350 --> 00:53:02.640
land bridge which then a line is a theoretical line is drawn through it.

626
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.900
And on one side is one city and the other side knows it is a wonderful

627
00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:12.440
archeological discovery of a boundary stone up in the near Athens which on which

628
00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:20.790
is written on one side.
This is Athens.

629
00:53:21.090 --> 00:53:22.410
It is not Negara.

630
00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:28.280
On the other side it says this is Negara.
It is not Athens.

631
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:32.420
So there is that kind of a boundary as well.
And.

632
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:37.020
That is a place where trouble is likely to emerge.

633
00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:41.130
Greeks will say once the police are in place they will spend a great deal of

634
00:53:41.131 --> 00:53:42.270
time fighting each other.

635
00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:47.880
A normal reason for fighting is a dispute about a piece of land that is more or

636
00:53:49.411 --> 00:53:51.870
less on the boundary between them.

637
00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:55.050
And so that's one aspect of their world.

638
00:53:56.070 --> 00:54:00.090
What about how big are these things.
Answer from the 20th century America.

639
00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:04.770
Very small.
I think the word tiny might be justified.

640
00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:09.010
We start with the most abnormal of them in this respect.

641
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:12.270
The largest Polis of which we know it's Athens.

642
00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:18.620
Unlike many police Athens had been successful in gaining the city of Athens

643
00:54:20.491 --> 00:54:25.491
itself had been successful in gaining control of the whole region which had

644
00:54:26.521 --> 00:54:31.521
dominated the region of Attica so that anybody by the time history dawns anybody

645
00:54:33.211 --> 00:54:38.211
who lives in the peninsula that is Attica is an Athenian even if he lives in a

646
00:54:39.661 --> 00:54:43.380
village or a good sized town 60 miles away.

647
00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:48.660
He is still an Athenian he can be a citizen of his community he can be a

648
00:54:48.661 --> 00:54:53.661
marathon in but he is also and more primarily he is an Athenian.

649
00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:57.353
Now Atika.

650
00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:03.590
Was is in fact approximately a thousand square miles which I'm told is about the

651
00:55:06.331 --> 00:55:08.340
size of Rhode Island.

652
00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:12.780
And that's the biggest Polis of which we know.

653
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:19.970
There are well over a thousand police.

654
00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:24.500
Some people want to push the number at its height up to maybe fifteen hundred

655
00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:25.373
but doesn't matter.

656
00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:30.170
You're talking about lots and lots of what is the typical

657
00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:35.660
size of them.
What is the typical population of them.

658
00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:41.410
Well Aristotle and Plato both sort of theoreticians of the polis each had an

659
00:55:43.521 --> 00:55:47.120
idea what's the right size for the perfect post.

660
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:52.630
Aristotle said the right size is a place where.

661
00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:58.900
All of the citizens by which he meant male adult citizens could come to a

662
00:55:59.751 --> 00:56:04.751
central place and hear a speaker and that number comes out to be about 5000 male

663
00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:12.160
adults Plato.

664
00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:18.010
Being a mathematician as Aristotle was not decided that the perfect place would

665
00:56:18.381 --> 00:56:23.381
have five thousand and forty citizens why five thousand and forty.

666
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:27.880
You may ask do we have any mathematicians among us who will give me a quick

667
00:56:27.881 --> 00:56:28.714
answer to that

668
00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:37.580
saying in.
I don't even know what that means.

669
00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:39.200
That's how good a mathematician I am.

670
00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:44.210
Tell me does it mean the same thing as it has the greatest number of.

671
00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:46.210
Numbers that go into it equally.

672
00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:52.510
That's the answer I heard that all right.
Okay.
Yeah.

673
00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:56.920
Simpson.
All right enough of this mathematical folderol.

674
00:56:56.950 --> 00:57:00.640
As you can see I don't understand but look here's the point.

675
00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:03.250
We're talking about five thousand adult males.

676
00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:07.540
That's the ideal polis as far as these guys are concerned.

677
00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:10.460
Athens was not the ideal place.
It was big.

678
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:16.630
How many men did it have in its fullest blown somewhere between 40 and 50000.

679
00:57:24.210 --> 00:57:27.060
It's impossible to have a better guess than that.

680
00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:34.760
Then if you want to say how many human beings lived in Attica when the greatest

681
00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:42.760
number did we are speaking about something between a quarter of a million and

682
00:57:43.491 --> 00:57:48.491
three hundred sounds but you have to understand just from what I've already told

683
00:57:48.931 --> 00:57:53.931
you this is extraordinarily large and I think you must realize that most polls

684
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.550
if you're thinking about a thousand or more polls would have been well under

685
00:58:02.890 --> 00:58:07.890
five thousand adult male citizens so I would just wanted to give you an idea of

686
00:58:10.491 --> 00:58:15.491
just how small most of these places are as well as indicating sharp departures.

687
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:18.020
OK.

688
00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:21.870
Now the polls from the beginning and it never stopped being that what I'm about

689
00:58:21.871 --> 00:58:26.871
to say chiefly agricultural communities

690
00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:34.590
most of the people and I think it's reasonable to guess that a very high

691
00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:41.170
majority of the people would be living on farms engaged in farming feeding

692
00:58:43.341 --> 00:58:45.740
themselves and the rest of the community.

693
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:51.750
Unlike the ancient near eastern cities these towns do not grow up around a

694
00:58:51.851 --> 00:58:53.850
temple or a market place.

695
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:58.150
<v 16>Confluence of rivers as they do in medieval Europe.</v>

696
00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:03.030
No they grow up like the Athenian does right smack in the middle of a plane

697
00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:08.760
which is a good place for farming with a great high Acropolis available even the

698
00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:16.070
characteristic thing in a poll is the Agora the marketplace which is also

699
00:59:16.351 --> 00:59:18.960
becomes the civic center of these towns.

700
00:59:19.350 --> 00:59:24.350
Even these grew up later than the polls they show up a century or more typically

701
00:59:25.621 --> 00:59:26.310
after.

702
00:59:26.310 --> 00:59:31.310
We know that there's a polis there and the Agora comes about in a gradual way.

703
00:59:34.290 --> 00:59:39.230
<v 5>I think you should never imagine in these real old policies that got things</v>

704
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:42.630
started that somebody said let's have a pollers

705
00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:45.570
things just happen.

706
00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:49.800
They just grew up one nice way that if you think here Athens is helpful.

707
00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.690
How many of you ever been to Athens resident Yeah.

708
00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:59.080
And the rest of you when you go on the north shore north slope of the Acropolis

709
01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:03.590
beyond the agora.

710
01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:08.420
There is the the area of Athens known as the plaque.

711
01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:13.900
It's the oldest inhabited area in Athens and there you will find that unlike the

712
01:00:14.391 --> 01:00:19.160
more modern Athens in which streets laid out at 90 degrees angles perfectly.

713
01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:24.240
It's a mess.
I mean the streets whined around and.

714
01:00:24.550 --> 01:00:29.240
And that's because the original streets were followed the way the cattle did

715
01:00:29.241 --> 01:00:33.290
their wandering looking for food and then they that became the roads.

716
01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:34.470
So you have to.

717
01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:39.580
I want to stress the sense of natural development not some kind of a central

718
01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:43.970
authority making a decision about anything.

719
01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:50.030
It is also pretty clear that for some time after the foundation of the poles

720
01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.250
there were no city walls.

721
01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:56.780
These were not defended your your farmland was not defended.

722
01:00:57.950 --> 01:01:02.950
If you had a house outside the Acropolis as you would it was not defended what

723
01:01:03.261 --> 01:01:03.740
happened.

724
01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:08.740
If the town was attacked invaded everybody who could ran up to the Acropolis to

725
01:01:09.741 --> 01:01:14.600
defend himself.
So that's how things were in the elementary phase.

726
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:19.630
Now there are Greek traditions that are taken seriously by the Greeks that

727
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:26.470
suggest that kings ruled these cities from the beginning and they have lists of

728
01:01:28.071 --> 01:01:31.790
kings with their names and sometimes with stories attached to them.

729
01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:37.900
And I think myself that there were people who had the title Barcelona's.

730
01:01:40.070 --> 01:01:45.070
And they were noblemen and that they had some kind of a position of influence

731
01:01:45.771 --> 01:01:50.660
and authority in the state.
But as I think we have seen already.

732
01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:56.060
They were not kings in the oriental sense and

733
01:01:57.930 --> 01:02:02.930
once we have a palace it looks as though we don't have kings any longer in any

734
01:02:04.781 --> 01:02:07.030
shape manner or form.
What.

735
01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:12.540
Kind of regime that emerges alongside the polos is an aristocratic republic in

736
01:02:15.191 --> 01:02:20.191
which the noblemen have influence and power within the community by tradition

737
01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:25.350
and they are plural.

738
01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:31.110
There was not one real king there are there is typically a council of

739
01:02:31.811 --> 01:02:35.200
aristocrats that is the outfit that counts

740
01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:41.120
he said whom I have not mentioned to you before.

741
01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:46.390
A poet who we think to have lived around 700 B.C. very early in the history of

742
01:02:48.771 --> 01:02:49.604
the palace

743
01:02:51.290 --> 01:02:56.290
wrote one of his poems called the works and days is advice to farmers on how to

744
01:02:58.431 --> 01:03:03.431
live but it also contains a story in which he talks about himself and the quarry

745
01:03:04.521 --> 01:03:09.521
has with his brother over who inherits what from the father and he claims he's

746
01:03:10.941 --> 01:03:15.830
been cheated out of his inheritance inheritance because his brother bribed the

747
01:03:16.610 --> 01:03:19.040
judges.
Well who are these judges.

748
01:03:19.310 --> 01:03:22.860
He calls them busty lace kings.

749
01:03:23.330 --> 01:03:28.330
These would have been these aristocratic figures who we know in the earliest

750
01:03:30.290 --> 01:03:31.200
days of the polls.

751
01:03:31.610 --> 01:03:36.610
They were the judicial authority basing that on their claim to divine descent on

752
01:03:38.511 --> 01:03:43.511
their certainly noble descent and on the fact that the nobility had a monopoly

753
01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:48.750
of knowledge about what the traditions of the community are.

754
01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:54.220
So but he said complains about the it calls them bribe swallowing postulates

755
01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:00.730
crooked ones plural plural kings as in Homer.

756
01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:07.570
It's also interesting Athens has a very clear tradition of thinking they had

757
01:04:09.261 --> 01:04:14.261
kings and I think very telling is the story they said they give us about how

758
01:04:14.661 --> 01:04:17.600
kingship came to an end in Athens.

759
01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:19.670
I mean I just want to let me start by.

760
01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:24.620
<v 16>Contrasting it with what I think is fairly typical.
The Romans also had kings.</v>

761
01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:30.070
I think they had probably real kings just before the emergence of their republic

762
01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:35.430
and that of kingship came to an end according to the Romans story.

763
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:41.230
And the Republic succeeded it when one of the kings the last one talked Quintus

764
01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:45.230
superbugs to purpose and that means arrogant

765
01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:52.620
corneas misbehaved most seriously by raping the daughter of a nobleman Lucrecia

766
01:04:54.590 --> 01:04:59.590
that caused the rebellion and they overthrew the Kings and thereafter the word

767
01:05:00.141 --> 01:05:04.040
King was a dirty word in Roman history.

768
01:05:05.570 --> 01:05:10.570
The best example is when Julius Caesar has made himself master of Rome but he's

769
01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:15.230
still behaving as though the Republic exists.

770
01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:18.200
People either who want to embarrass him.

771
01:05:18.590 --> 01:05:23.050
Well yes I think people want to embarrass and send around the story.

772
01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:28.100
Caesar is wants to make himself king.

773
01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.400
The word for king in Latin is Rex.

774
01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:36.970
And so he he he's tried to diffuse that with a pun by saying known some Rex said

775
01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:44.180
Kaiser I'm not Rex I'm not King I'm not Rex my name is Caesar.

776
01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:47.433
Well.

777
01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:52.160
<v 11>In fact he pretty well was ready to turn himself into a king but he wouldn't use</v>

778
01:05:52.161 --> 01:05:52.994
that word.

779
01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:57.210
He wouldn't use that word because it had such a terrible smell.

780
01:05:58.030 --> 01:06:03.030
<v 16>Kings were despots dictators rapists they were not you didn't want to be one.</v>

781
01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:07.470
Well.
Look at the story of the Athenians.
Tell

782
01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:14.050
there was this king of Athens coldness was his name.

783
01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:19.390
They were the Athenians were invaded by an army from the outside.

784
01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:23.050
Congress led his forces out against them.

785
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:28.500
He fought brilliantly and bravely and drove the enemy from the field.

786
01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:32.290
In the course of the battle he himself was killed.

787
01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:38.220
The Athenians loved and respected him so much that they gave him the almost

788
01:06:39.191 --> 01:06:44.191
unheard of honor of burying him right on the spot where he fell in the field and

789
01:06:45.941 --> 01:06:50.941
thereafter his name was always followed with glory admiration and devotion.

790
01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:57.340
Well what kind of a story is that.
How do you get rid of a kingdom.

791
01:06:57.910 --> 01:07:00.080
Why would you get rid of King.
Oh I forgot to tell you the.

792
01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:02.650
Why did they get rid of the king because they thought they could never have

793
01:07:02.651 --> 01:07:06.320
another one so good so why try.
Give me a break.

794
01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:12.340
No I think somebody had to make up a story but their memory of Kings was not of

795
01:07:12.341 --> 01:07:13.340
a tar corneas.

796
01:07:13.610 --> 01:07:18.610
<v 13>It was not of a brutal despotic ruler because they didn't have any such thing.</v>

797
01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:24.770
<v 5>We don't know how the change came about or if some people question if they ever</v>

798
01:07:24.771 --> 01:07:25.630
really did have kings.

799
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.640
But the picture I want you to have is that's not the tradition.

800
01:07:29.030 --> 01:07:31.620
The tradition is aristocracy.

801
01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:36.740
That's what we connect with the Poles and of course it was all natural because

802
01:07:36.741 --> 01:07:41.741
it also fit into the world of the Iliad The Odyssey which they were accustomed

803
01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:43.700
to think about.

804
01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:50.500
I think that's a good place to start.

805
01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:55.560
Next time I will take up the story of the expansion of the world of the colors

806
01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:58.940
which takes the form of colonization.
