1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,090
Why aren't you all home
like the rest of the class.

2
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:19,050
My subject today is
parrot Cleaves as general.

3
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,870
I don't expect that it
will take up all our time.

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,900
So if you like when I'm through I'd
be glad to respond to any questions or

5
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:32,440
comments that you want to make
about the Peloponnesian War.

6
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:38,080
So if you're if you think of any as I'm
talking I hope you'll have a shot at it.

7
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,530
Near the end of his biography of Pericles
Plutarch describes his great Athenian

8
00:00:48,321 --> 00:00:49,980
leader on his deathbed.

9
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,500
The best men of Athens and his personal
friends are gathered in his room and are

10
00:00:58,371 --> 00:01:02,900
discussing the greatness of his
virtues and the power he held.

11
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,940
Thinking he was asleep.

12
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,720
They added up his achievements
and the number of his trophies.

13
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,200
For his general.

14
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:17,220
He had set up nine commemorating
a victory on behalf of the city.

15
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,780
Now we are inclined to think of Pericles
primarily as a great political leader a

16
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:31,171
brilliant orator a patron of the Arts and
Sciences the man who whose work in the

17
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:39,391
peaceful arts shaped what is often
called the Golden Age of Athens

18
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,530
so it's useful for us to remember that
the office to which the people elected

19
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:50,531
him almost every year for some 30 years
from which he carried on all of these

20
00:01:51,951 --> 00:01:56,951
activities was that of strata Goss general
and that foremost responsibility of

21
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,180
Athenian generals was to lead
armies and navies into battle.

22
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:12,220
From his own time until modern times
Pericles talents as a general have been

23
00:02:12,771 --> 00:02:17,771
criticized and defended in the first
year of the Peloponnesian War when his

24
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:22,840
strategy called for the
Athenians to huddle behind
the walls of their city while

25
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:26,780
the invading Peloponnesian army
ravage their lands in Attica.

26
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,370
Lucidity says the city was angry with
Paris police they abused him because as

27
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:38,741
their general he did not lead them out
into battle and they held him responsible

28
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,480
for all they were suffering

29
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:47,270
in the next year after another invasion
and destruction of their crops and farms.

30
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,540
And after a terrible plague had struck
the city against acidity says they blame

31
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:58,991
Pericles for persuading them to go to
war and they held him responsible for

32
00:02:59,691 --> 00:03:00,770
their misfortunes.

33
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,120
At a lower level the poet Herr MIPS one
of the poets comic poets whose work we

34
00:03:09,861 --> 00:03:13,070
don't have but occasionally we
have a quotation and here's one.

35
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,320
Herr members present to
one of his comedies in the
spring of 430 the second year

36
00:03:18,321 --> 00:03:22,190
of the war that simply charged
Paris Cleese with cowardice.

37
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,400
He addresses Pericles as follows.

38
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:31,090
King of the SAT here's why don't you
ever lift a spear but instead only use

39
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:36,200
dreadful words to wage the war.

40
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,430
Assuming the character
of the cowardly Teles.

41
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:46,470
But if a little knife is sharpened on a
whetstone you roar as though bitten by

42
00:03:47,931 --> 00:03:52,931
the fierce click on clean as you know
was his major opponent in the last years

43
00:03:54,171 --> 00:03:59,171
of his life and Clinton was hawkish
and an advocate of aggressive active

44
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,003
fighting.

45
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,910
Now the title of this talk Pericles is
general is also the name of the most

46
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,970
vehement modern attack on Pericles.

47
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,120
As a general I say modern of course
I'm talking about the 19th century when

48
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:18,790
you're an ancient historian.
Things take on those proportions.

49
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:25,230
The author Dr. Julius fun fluke Hartung
was a veteran of the Franco Prussian war

50
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,950
and an appreciative student of what he
took to be the lessons taught by the

51
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:36,760
great military historian and
theorists theorist Clausewitz.

52
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,950
He believed that he had acquired some
useful knowledge of the science of war as

53
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:46,951
he put it that led him vigorously and
entirely to condemn Pericles as general

54
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:53,380
generalship in Pericles conduct
of the Peloponnesian War he says.

55
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,890
We see expeditions without inner unity
without the possibility of greater

56
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:00,964
results.

57
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,320
And I'm quoting Luke
Hartung now to avoid danger.

58
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,590
Pericles regularly gave
away important advantages.

59
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,280
Overall we find the effort to lose no
battle but nowhere to win one as much as

60
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:20,560
Pericles personal courage operated
in battle and in the assembly.

61
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,160
So little did he have the courage proper
to a general which boldly risks the

62
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:31,500
life of thousands at the decisive moment.

63
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,950
As such he belongs to those.

64
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,980
One may say a philosophical group which
brings everything as neatly as possible

65
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,230
into the system and plan.

66
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,890
Instead of acting openly and vigorously.

67
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,040
It is a fact that cleaves the chief
advocate of the anti Spartan policy never

68
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,850
offered a single battle
against the Spartans

69
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,030
at the higher level of strategy.

70
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:07,510
The critique of Pericles is no less
severe prickly is was a good minister of

71
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:09,264
war.

72
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,810
Who made far sighted preparations but
as General he did not know how to make

73
00:06:15,811 --> 00:06:18,510
good use of the existing situation.

74
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,470
Again I quote He was
a great booga Meister.

75
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,220
This means mayor said it was not a very
friendly thing to call the great general

76
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,590
who led Athens. It was a great burger
Meister. In the true sense of the word.

77
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:40,130
There is the rich many sidedness of his
nature which was then by that which came

78
00:06:40,411 --> 00:06:45,411
into play his superiority to
corruption everything petty and paltry.

79
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,520
Yet he lacked the prophet's vision and
the certain luck of the born statesman.

80
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,300
Above all he lacked the recklessness which
is often needed to lead what has been

81
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,490
what has begun to the goal.

82
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
As the leader of foreign policy he was
not comparable to a sin Mr. Cleese as a

83
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:13,020
general not even approximately to Akeem on

84
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,560
so that's the harshest of
the critics of Pericles.

85
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Over the years but Pericles has been very
lucky over the years in his defenders

86
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,150
in antiquity.

87
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,250
His performance was justified
and praised by lucidity.

88
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,360
It was after all a contemporary general
himself and the historian of the period

89
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,480
whose interpretations have dominated
opinion ever since he wrote for all the

90
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:50,821
objectivity of the acidity style he
tells the story very much from Pericles

91
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,773
viewpoint.

92
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:57,400
For instance when he describes the
revolt against the Athenian leader in the

93
00:07:57,401 --> 00:08:02,401
second year of the war and the Athenians
unsuccessful effort to make peace.

94
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:08,820
This is how he describes the aftermath
being totally at a loss as what as to

95
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:10,354
what to do.

96
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,520
They the Athenian people attack
Pericles and when he saw that they were

97
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:20,521
exasperated and doing everything as he
had anticipated he called an assembly

98
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,960
since he was still general.

99
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:28,950
He wanted to put confidence into them
and leading them away from their anger to

100
00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:31,780
restore their calm and their courage.

101
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:37,890
He reports three of Pericles that is to
say Cincinnati's does reports three of

102
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:43,051
Pericles speeches at length without
reporting any of the speeches made by his

103
00:08:43,451 --> 00:08:47,650
opponents on those occasions with the
result that the reader is made to see the

104
00:08:47,651 --> 00:08:49,900
situation through Pericles eyes.

105
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:56,100
And finally he makes his own judgment
perfectly clear coming down firmly and

106
00:08:57,281 --> 00:09:02,020
powerfully on the side of Pericles
and against all of his critics

107
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:08,530
here's what's to say that he says as
long as he led the state in peacetime he

108
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:14,381
kept to a moderate policy and kept it
safe and it was under his leadership that

109
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:17,270
Athens reached her greatest heights.

110
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,080
And when the war came and it appears
that he also judged its power correctly

111
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:30,310
Pericles lived for two years and six
months after the war began and after his

112
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:37,021
death his foresight about the war was
acknowledged still more for he had said

113
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:44,010
that if the Athenians stayed
on the defensive maintained
their navy and did not

114
00:09:45,131 --> 00:09:49,960
try to expand their empire in wartime
thereby endangering the state.

115
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,620
They would win out but they acted
opposite to his advice in every way.

116
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,800
And when their efforts failed they
harm the state's conduct of the war.

117
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:09,110
Now in spite of his success excuses
of his successor's departure from his

118
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:14,090
strategy and the disasters that resulted
in spite of the entry of the Persian

119
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:19,091
Empire into the enemy ranks the Athenians
held out for ten years after the

120
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:25,661
disastrous Sicilian expedition and for
twenty seven years with interruption

121
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:31,810
altogether here's what you said at his
final word on this subject so more than

122
00:10:34,431 --> 00:10:39,431
abundant was parrot Cleaves reasons for
his own predictions that Athens would

123
00:10:40,971 --> 00:10:45,971
have won in a war against
the Peloponnesian along the
city's makes it absolutely

124
00:10:47,061 --> 00:10:49,050
clear cities.

125
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,610
Apparently it was right in the strategy
that he had adopted and if the Athenians

126
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,740
had stuck to it they
would have won the war.

127
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,820
Plutarch accepted to sit in his judgment.

128
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,920
And added further defense against
the charges of cowardice and lack of

129
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:09,630
enterprise that his enemies were
launching against Pericles to Plutarch.

130
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:14,660
The actions that provoked such into
accusations instead revealed prudence

131
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,560
moderation and a desire to protect the
safety of Athenian soldiers in 454.

132
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,350
We're back now.

133
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,340
In the first Peloponnesian War Pericles
led a sea borne expedition into the

134
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:32,730
Corinthian Gulf.

135
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:38,640
Facilities merely reports that he defeated
the sick he only ends in battle and

136
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:43,230
ravaged the territory and besieged
the important city of anybody.

137
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,100
Though he failed to take it and then
sailed home obviously answering later

138
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:54,961
criticism Plutarch concludes his account
of these events by saying that Pericles

139
00:11:56,141 --> 00:12:01,141
returned to Athens and now I quote him
having showed himself to be formidable to

140
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:06,751
the enemy but a safe and effective
commander to his fellow citizens for no

141
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:12,640
misfortune struck the
men on the expedition

142
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:19,150
and 437 he sailed into the black sea on
a mission of imperial consolidation that

143
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,100
amounted to little more
than showing the flag.

144
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:29,850
To the local barbarians an action that
was too insignificant to be even noticed

145
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,360
by its editors.

146
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:36,430
But Plutarch does not miss the chance
to meet the criticism that had been

147
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:38,140
directed against his hero.

148
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,900
On this campaign according to Plutarch
Pericles displayed the magnitude of his

149
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:48,280
forces and the fearlessness and
confident courage with which they sailed

150
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:53,490
wherever they liked and place the entire
sea under their power and 446 when B

151
00:12:56,251 --> 00:13:01,251
OCA was in rebellion the
bold and ambitious general
told Mahdi's convinced the

152
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:07,651
Assembly to send him at the head of an
army to put down the uprising Plutarch

153
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:13,201
reports that Pericles tried to restrain
and to persuade him to in the Assembly

154
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,140
making his famous remark.

155
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,270
That if he would not listen to parents
please he would not go wrong in waiting

156
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:25,750
for time.
The wisest counselor

157
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,870
but told he didn't listen and he went.
And the result was a disaster.

158
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,440
The Athenians suffered many casualties.

159
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,560
Thomas's was kill B OCA was lost Plutarch
comment is that this is an incident

160
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,640
brought great fame and
goodwill to Pericles as a man
of prudence and patriotism.

161
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,120
Later in the same year
rebellion broke out in UBS.

162
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:59,190
And Negara revolted. Opening the road
for a Peloponnesian invasion of Attica.

163
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,800
Pericles on this occasion had no choice
he led an Athenian army out to meet the

164
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:05,634
invading army.

165
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,560
But instead of fighting
a battle he convinced the
Spartans to withdraw and then

166
00:14:10,561 --> 00:14:11,880
to negotiate a peace.

167
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,090
In retrospect no doubt his critics accused
him of missing a chance for victory

168
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:23,091
in the field facilities
reports the Peloponnesian
withdrawal without comment or

169
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,344
explanation.

170
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:31,010
But Plutarch uses this action to respond
in almost poetic language to later

171
00:14:32,311 --> 00:14:37,311
charges that accompany the Peloponnesian
invasion in 431 reporting that his

172
00:14:38,071 --> 00:14:43,071
enemies Pericles enemies threatened and
denounced him and choruses sang mocking

173
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:49,791
songs to his shame and insulted his
generalship for its cowardice and for

174
00:14:51,751 --> 00:14:54,210
abandoning everything to the enemy.

175
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,870
The Peloponnesian Plutarch
tells us expected the
Athenians to fight out of anger

176
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:06,210
and pride but apparently as it appeared
terrible to fight a battle against sixty

177
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:13,090
thousand Peloponnesian and
b ocean hotlines for that
was a number of those who

178
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:15,410
made the first invasion.

179
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:20,650
I'm still quoting Plutarch and to
state the city itself on the outcome he

180
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:28,121
reports Pericles calming language to
the XIV excited Athenians and 431 saying

181
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:33,500
that trees though cut
and lopped grew quickly.

182
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:39,250
But if men were destroyed it was not
easy to get them back again had he turned

183
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:41,520
off.

184
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:46,130
I'm sorry here he turned to the charges
of cowardice and lack of enterprise and

185
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:50,730
he turned them on their heads and did
so more fully in a passage that sums up

186
00:15:50,731 --> 00:15:52,910
his view of Pericles generalship.

187
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,310
And I'll read it to
you in his generalship.

188
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,500
He was especially famous for his caution.
He never will.

189
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,620
He never willingly undertook a battle
that involved great risk or uncertainty.

190
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:12,590
Nor did he envy or emulate those who
took great risks with brilliant success.

191
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,450
And were admired as great generals.

192
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,320
He always said to his fellow citizens
that as far as it was in his power they

193
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:25,350
would live forever and be immortals.

194
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:32,150
Of the many modern scholars who have been
persuaded by this view none has argued

195
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:37,981
more forcefully in favor of Pericles
generalship than Hunt's Del Brook.

196
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:43,830
Perhaps the most renowned military
historian of his day and still a respected

197
00:16:44,501 --> 00:16:49,501
figure in that field he he and
Hartung were contemporaries.

198
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,030
They lived in the well they did their
writing on this subject in the last

199
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:56,710
decades of the nineteenth century.

200
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:03,180
Annoyed by by the critics critiques
rather lately leveled at Pericles and

201
00:17:03,701 --> 00:17:05,200
especially by Flockhart John.

202
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,280
He wrote a thorough defense in 1890
under the title The General's ship of

203
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:19,650
Pericles explained through the
generalship of Frederick the Great.

204
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:26,330
His main effort in that work is to
justify Pericles conduct of the war that

205
00:17:26,851 --> 00:17:28,360
began in 431.

206
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,940
The subject of the greatest criticism
leveled at the Athenian general

207
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,520
Pericles strategy did not aim at defeating
the Spartans in battle but was meant

208
00:17:40,831 --> 00:17:45,090
to convince them that war
against Athens was futile.

209
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:51,350
His strategic goals therefore
were entirely defensive
he told the Athenians that

210
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,980
if they would remain quiet
take care of their fleet.

211
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,220
Refrain from trying to extend their empire
in wartime and so putting their city

212
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:06,221
in danger they would prevail the Athenians
were to reject battle on land abandon

213
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:13,151
their fields and homes in the country to
Spartan devastation and retreat behind

214
00:18:13,971 --> 00:18:14,804
their walls.

215
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:20,620
Meanwhile their navy would launch a series
of commando raids on the coast of the

216
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:22,334
Peloponnese.

217
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,380
This strategy would continue until the
frustrated enemy was prepared to make

218
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:28,214
peace.

219
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,640
The naval raids and landings were not
meant to do serious harm but merely to

220
00:18:34,371 --> 00:18:39,371
annoy the enemy and to suggest how much
damage the Athenians could do if they

221
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:40,784
chose.

222
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:46,810
The strategy was not to exhaust the
Peloponnesian physically or materially but

223
00:18:47,151 --> 00:18:48,140
psychologically

224
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:55,060
no such strategy had ever been attempted
in Greek history for no state before

225
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:59,330
the coming of the Athenian
imperial democracy.

226
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,930
Ever had the man the means
for trying such a strategy.

227
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:09,130
To do so was not easy for
this unprecedented strategy
was ran directly across

228
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,024
the grain.

229
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:15,590
As you know of Greek tradition
willingness to fight.

230
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:21,490
Bravery and steadfastness in battle became
the essential characteristics of the

231
00:19:22,551 --> 00:19:27,530
free man and the citizen
Pericles strategy of passivity.

232
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:32,150
Therefore ran counter to the
teachings of the Greek tradition.

233
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:39,260
But most Athenians were farmers whose
lands and homes were outside the walls.

234
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:46,490
The prickly and strategy required them
to look on idly while their houses crops

235
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,540
and vines and olive trees were damaged
or entirely destroyed in the face of

236
00:19:55,501 --> 00:20:00,501
these facts as well as of the power of
tradition and the cultural values of the

237
00:20:01,561 --> 00:20:02,394
Greeks.

238
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:07,740
It is hard to understand even in
retrospect how Pericles could convince the

239
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:10,170
Athenians to adopt his strategy.

240
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:16,630
Tilbrook keenly aware of Athens
numerical inferiority on land.

241
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,120
Was Convinced of the soundness
of Pericles approach.

242
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,680
Here's what Del Brooke wrote.

243
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,590
The structure of the Peloponnesian War
obliges us to give him a position not

244
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:33,591
simply among the great statesmen but
also among the great military leaders of

245
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:35,604
world history.

246
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:41,630
It is not his war plan as such that
bestows this right on him for the fame of

247
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:47,421
the commander is gained not by word but
by deed but rather the gigantic power of

248
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:53,961
decision that accompanied it not to haul
with a half measure but to plunge in

249
00:20:55,231 --> 00:21:00,231
whole heartedly and to give up completely
what had to be sacrificed the entire

250
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,360
attic countryside.

251
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,320
And in addition the strength of personal
authority that was able to make such a

252
00:21:09,481 --> 00:21:14,481
decision understandable to a Democratic
National Assembly and to gain their

253
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:19,731
approval the execution of this decision
is a strategic deed that can be compared

254
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,530
favorably with any victory

255
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:31,180
take that critics Delle
Brook was pulling no punches.

256
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,050
And if you said he was a bum
I say he was the greatest

257
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:41,990
Del Brooke tries to bolster his case by
comparing Pericles with Frederick the

258
00:21:41,991 --> 00:21:45,230
Great King of Prussia in the 18th century.

259
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:51,070
During the seven years war Frederick
applied Waddell Brook calls a strategy of

260
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:56,890
exhaustion instead of the strategy of
annihilation in which one army seeks out

261
00:21:58,311 --> 00:22:03,311
the other to bring it to decisive
battle with the goal of destroying its

262
00:22:04,191 --> 00:22:06,200
nation's ability to resist

263
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:12,730
such a strategy is sometimes adopted
by or forced upon the weaker side in a

264
00:22:14,481 --> 00:22:18,720
conflict because no other
choice promises success.

265
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,520
In the 20th century the North Vietnamese
Communists used it with success against

266
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:29,801
the United States superior firepower
brought the Americans victory and set

267
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:34,850
battles but was not so effective in
dealing with various forms of guerrilla

268
00:22:34,851 --> 00:22:35,684
warfare.

269
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,200
The Communists therefore usually
avoided battles throughout the war.

270
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:47,170
Continuing warfare over years without
a decisive result fed division and

271
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:52,541
discontent in America and ultimately
exhausted the American will to fight.

272
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:59,470
In the second Punic War Rome repeatedly
suffered crushing defeats in battle at

273
00:23:00,651 --> 00:23:01,730
the hands of Hannibal.

274
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,080
The Romans therefore chose the tactics
of quinces Fabius Maximus avoiding battle

275
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,790
harassing the enemy with guerrilla
warfare until they grew stronger.

276
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:19,570
And he far from home and cut off from it
by sea grew weaker and was compelled to

277
00:23:20,811 --> 00:23:23,710
withdraw prickliness.

278
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:28,820
Strategy however was un like
these strategies in many
ways unlike the Vietnamese

279
00:23:31,591 --> 00:23:33,240
Communists and the Romans.

280
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:38,870
He never attempted a set battle on
land the Vietnamese war down America's

281
00:23:39,781 --> 00:23:42,570
resolve by inflicting
casualties on their forces.

282
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,960
The Romans avoided battle only
sale so long as they had to.

283
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:52,470
Their ultimate aim was to defeat the
enemy in standard battles which finally

284
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,333
they did.

285
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:58,450
In Italy Spain and Africa Del Brook's
comparison with Frederick strategy seems

286
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:05,041
to me no less faulty the Prussian monarch
was driven to it by combat losses in

287
00:24:06,641 --> 00:24:11,641
set battles fought over two years and
by the absence of any alternative he

288
00:24:13,061 --> 00:24:15,490
needed to avoid battle to survive.

289
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:21,630
Only good fortune not calculated war
plans could save him Britain came to his

290
00:24:22,931 --> 00:24:27,931
aid with financial assistance and then
the most incalculable of all things

291
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:29,110
happened.

292
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:34,110
The death of the row of the room sorry
the Russian empress who was a great fan

293
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:35,950
of the.

294
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:40,450
I mean who was hostile to Frederick
broke up the coalition of his enemies

295
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:45,690
allowing him to escape from the war
unbeaten she was succeeded by a tsar who

296
00:24:46,421 --> 00:24:50,680
loved Frederick the Great
and there by saved his neck.

297
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:56,710
The situation confronting Pericles was
entirely different from these cases.

298
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:03,060
No helpful allies stood in the wings
and no fortunate accident came to divide

299
00:25:04,631 --> 00:25:09,631
his opponents since he avoided all
fighting on land against the Spartans.

300
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:15,570
He inflicted no casualties as the
Vietnamese and the Romans did.

301
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:21,490
They and Frederick moreover aimed finally
at fighting and winning battles when

302
00:25:21,491 --> 00:25:23,130
the odds were in their favor.

303
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:29,560
The core of Pericles plan however was to
avoid all land battles to show that the

304
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:35,850
Palestinians could do Athens no serious
harm and to exhaust them psychologically

305
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:41,950
to make them see reason and understand
that their efforts were futile and could

306
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:47,621
not bring them victory his plan
did not work the element of chance.

307
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:55,120
The unexpected and incalculable intervened
against Pyrrhic leaves and against

308
00:25:55,941 --> 00:26:00,941
Athens in the form of the terrible plague
that ultimately killed a third of the

309
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:03,770
Athenian population.

310
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:09,320
Of course all this encourage the pull
up nations who refused to be discouraged

311
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,880
and continue to fight.

312
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:16,880
When Pericles died and for twenty nine
the Athenian Treasury was running dry.

313
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:22,700
His plan lay in ruins and there
was no prospect for victory.

314
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Only when his successors turned to a more
aggressive strategy did the Athenians

315
00:26:30,961 --> 00:26:35,961
level the playing field and achieve a
position allow them to hold out for twenty

316
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:37,020
seven years.

317
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:42,350
And indeed on more than one occasion
almost brought victory so it's not

318
00:26:42,881 --> 00:26:47,881
surprising that Pericles strategy and
the prickly and the Peloponnesian War has

319
00:26:48,011 --> 00:26:53,010
brought criticism that raises questions
about his capacity as a military leader

320
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:58,650
even from sober and friendly scholars
Garrow booze old very distinguished German

321
00:27:00,071 --> 00:27:04,190
historian. Regarded his
strategy as fundamentally right.

322
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:10,170
But even he thought that it was somewhat
one sided and doctrinaire and in its

323
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:17,131
execution it was lacking in energetic
procedure and in the spirit of enterprise.

324
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,050
That's from a very good friend
Hermann Bentsen.

325
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:27,540
As you can see the Germans have dominated
this entire field of discussion.

326
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:34,470
Defends the plan against its critics but
concedes that the carrying out of the

327
00:27:35,891 --> 00:27:40,891
offensive part of the plan appears to
modern viewers as not very energetic and

328
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:42,784
resolute.

329
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:47,970
I'll say their influence no doubt
these critics are by the knowledge that

330
00:27:48,411 --> 00:27:53,411
prickly successors took some actions that
did not risk significant land battles

331
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:59,470
or numerous casualties and yet produced
important successes in the spring of

332
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:01,530
four twenty five.

333
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:07,040
The brilliant and daring
general Damascus's conceived
and executed a plan to

334
00:28:07,651 --> 00:28:12,651
seize and fortify the promontory of
pylons at the south western tip of the

335
00:28:13,501 --> 00:28:18,501
Peloponnese is from there the Athenians
could launch raids at will and encourage

336
00:28:19,351 --> 00:28:24,351
the escape or rebellion of the Hilux
Spartans enslaved population his success.

337
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,250
Panic.

338
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:31,250
The Spartans who allowed several hundred
of their troops to be trapped and

339
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34,590
captured on the island of
Spectre readjust off pylons.

340
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,350
The immediately proposed a peace

341
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,970
which the Athenians then refused

342
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:47,490
later in the same spring
the insane Athenians seized
and garrison the island of

343
00:28:47,491 --> 00:28:52,491
Cicero just off the south eastern tip
of the Peloponnese and immediately began

344
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:55,840
to launch raids against the mainland.

345
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:01,380
To today's reports that the Spartans
suffered what I think of as pretty much a

346
00:29:01,381 --> 00:29:02,760
nervous breakdown.

347
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,680
Here's the accounts facilities gift the
Spartans sent garrisons here and there

348
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:13,760
throughout the country deciding the
number of hot lights by what seemed

349
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,090
necessary at each place.

350
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,860
In other respects they were very much
on guard for fear that there would be a

351
00:29:19,861 --> 00:29:22,350
revolution against the established order.

352
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:28,030
And from every direction a war rose up
around them which was swift and defied

353
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,260
precaution in military of affairs.

354
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:34,220
They now became more
timid than ever before

355
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:40,730
since they were involved
in a naval contest outside
their normal conceptions of

356
00:29:40,731 --> 00:29:42,020
preparation for war.

357
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:47,460
And in this unaccustomed area they
fought against the Athenians to whom the

358
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:52,510
mission of an enterprise was always a
loss in respect to what they had expected

359
00:29:53,061 --> 00:29:53,894
to achieve.

360
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:57,710
In other words whatever victories the
Athenians won however great they are

361
00:29:57,711 --> 00:30:00,080
always disappointed because they
had expected more than that.

362
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:04,700
At the same time the misfortunes
that had struck them in such numbers

363
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,960
unexpectedly and in such a
short time caused great terror.

364
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:14,890
And they were afraid they Spartans were
that another calamity might again strike

365
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:18,630
them sometime like the one
on the islands victory.

366
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:24,410
For this reason they were less daring
and going into battle and they thought

367
00:30:24,411 --> 00:30:28,250
that whatever they undertook would
turn out badly because they had no

368
00:30:28,251 --> 00:30:29,360
self-confidence.

369
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:33,860
As a result of having little
previous experience with misfortune.

370
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,000
Let me just remind you of the enormous
confidence with which they entered the

371
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:40,700
war thinking that it would
be no problem at all.

372
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,720
All they had to do was walk into Attica
and either the Athenians would come out

373
00:30:44,721 --> 00:30:48,890
to fight them as they had done the last
time and be destroyed immediately or

374
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:52,550
they would surrender rather
than see their lands destroyed.

375
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:57,020
And look where to what they had been
reduced not by apparently a strategy of

376
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:01,910
exhaustion but by the rejection of
that strategy and the effort at a more

377
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,350
aggressive approach.

378
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:09,670
In the light of results such as these
it is natural to ask why did the

379
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:12,160
enterprises that produced the need.

380
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:19,390
I'm sorry that the enterprises
that produced these
successes why do they need to

381
00:31:19,391 --> 00:31:22,060
wait until the fifth year of the war.

382
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,240
Why didn't Pericles use them at once.

383
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:31,620
His failure to do so is the most weighty
of the charges brought against him and

384
00:31:32,921 --> 00:31:37,460
Del Brook uses much effort
and ingenuity to defend him.

385
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:43,510
He is forced to concede however that a
more aggressive offensive effort would

386
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:44,344
have been helpful.

387
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,330
He believes that the attack Pericles led
against epic dowries in the second year

388
00:31:49,331 --> 00:31:53,440
of the war and 430 was meant
to take and hold that city.

389
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:59,220
Quote from Del Brooke if any
such conquests had succeeded
any success in at car

390
00:31:59,771 --> 00:32:02,230
Narnia any campaign of devastation.

391
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:07,530
However intensive any fortification
of a coastal spot in Massena would

392
00:32:07,721 --> 00:32:08,600
disappear.

393
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:13,230
In comparison taking up the dollars
he says would have threatened the

394
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:14,850
neighboring states near the coast.

395
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,900
It might bring peace at once or at least
cool the ardor for war amongst parties

396
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,313
allies.

397
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:27,830
So why did Pericles wait and then do so
little Del Brooks answer is we do not

398
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,453
know.

399
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:38,260
The failure by so learned clever and
determined a scholar and by his many other

400
00:32:38,781 --> 00:32:43,781
defenders to explain Pericles behavior
in this way I think is a powerful sign

401
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,910
that they have taken the wrong path.

402
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:53,180
Pericles did not mean to use any serious
offensive measures to wear down the

403
00:32:53,581 --> 00:32:54,930
enemy's ability to fight.

404
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:01,160
His goal as I have said before was
psychological and intellectual to convince

405
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:06,791
the Spartans and their allies that
victory was impossible that the Athenians

406
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:11,360
could easily sustain the only
damage the enemy could inflict.

407
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:16,780
The ravishing of Attica and to show
that the ally to show to the allies.

408
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,490
I'm sorry that the
allies at the Athenians.

409
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,070
Forgive me to show it to them and
realize that the Athenians could do them

410
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:30,340
considerable harm if they chose Athens
carefully calculated limited offensive

411
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:37,221
efforts were meant to deliver a message
without inciting the enemy to fight and

412
00:33:39,661 --> 00:33:40,494
to fight harder.

413
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:46,250
Just as the carefully calculated limited
attacks by American forces against

414
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:53,150
North Vietnam aimed at putting pressure
on the enemy without causing their

415
00:33:53,401 --> 00:33:58,401
Chinese supporters to intervene that
kind of strategy calls for very delicate

416
00:34:00,361 --> 00:34:03,270
action and very delicate judgment.

417
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,970
And of course there's no
guarantee that it will work.

418
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:12,740
The offensive part of Pericles plan
was deliberately to do little harm for

419
00:34:15,791 --> 00:34:20,791
actions that were too aggressive
might anger the enemy and harden his

420
00:34:21,581 --> 00:34:22,414
determination.

421
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,800
The goal was to depress the enemy's spirit
by showing that there was no way for

422
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:34,530
them to win to destroy their will to
fight just a little footnote here.

423
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:41,700
That's always a critical issue in any
strategy that any body adopts in a war.

424
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:45,430
Really a two fundamental goals.

425
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,850
And they are not always.

426
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:52,420
They do not always
produce the same strategy.

427
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:57,750
One is to make it impossible for the
enemy to fight to destroy his capacity to

428
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:01,930
fight.
If you do that you have certain victory.

429
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,030
The other is to destroy his will to fight.

430
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:10,090
And of course if you do that you win but
his will may not be responsive to your

431
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:13,843
approach.

432
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,210
If they could destroy the Spartan
will they could be expected to make an

433
00:35:21,211 --> 00:35:26,211
associated piece that would return to
the status quo before the war only made

434
00:35:26,671 --> 00:35:31,671
more secure by the demonstration that
it could not be overthrown by force.

435
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,810
And that was Pericles his aim in the war

436
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:42,300
that strategy failed as had Pericles.

437
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:47,180
Diplomatic maneuvers in the period leading
to war from four thirty three to four

438
00:35:47,181 --> 00:35:50,540
thirty one when civil war and epidemics.

439
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:55,430
A remote town on the fringes of the Greek
world threatened to bring a great war

440
00:35:55,431 --> 00:35:58,700
between the Peloponnesian
league and the Athenian Empire.

441
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:04,360
Perry clearly Pericles as I have argued
to you pursued a policy of restrained

442
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:09,850
limited intervention meant to deter
Kahn's Spartans important ally without

443
00:36:12,681 --> 00:36:16,790
driving the Spartans and all their
Peloponnesian allies into a war against

444
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:21,791
Athens that effort also
failed and resulted in a
terrible war that Pericles had

445
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:25,710
wanted to have to avoid.

446
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,200
Do these great strategic failures fully
make the case for Pericles critics were

447
00:36:34,691 --> 00:36:39,010
they the result of cowardice lack
of enterprise and resolution.

448
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:43,930
I think that a fair examination of
his performance throughout his life as

449
00:36:43,931 --> 00:36:45,880
general suggests otherwise.

450
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:52,410
The charge of personal cowardice is
ludicrous even fluke Hartung concedes that

451
00:36:54,611 --> 00:36:58,090
his personal courage operated
in battle and in the assembly.

452
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:03,130
No Athenian who led armies and navies
in many battles repeatedly setting up

453
00:37:03,131 --> 00:37:06,400
trophies of victory could
have escaped condemnation.

454
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:11,420
Had he shown any sign of cowardice
nor could he have been re-elected Gen.

455
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,980
year after year.
If that was the picture of him

456
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:21,620
nor did he fail to demonstrate boldness
and enterprise in 446 the very survival

457
00:37:24,331 --> 00:37:26,960
of Athens and her empire were threatened.

458
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,890
The most menacing rebellions
broke out close to home.

459
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:35,950
You'll be a mega be OCA prickly swiftly
took an army to put down the ruby in

460
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:43,541
rebellion and justice swiftly withdrew
on news of the second which opens the

461
00:37:44,631 --> 00:37:48,800
door to a Peloponnesian
invasion of Attica. He arrived.

462
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:52,310
You remember too it just in time to
persuade the Spartans to withdraw.

463
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:56,880
And then he returned at once to UBS
to suppress the rebellions there.

464
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:02,600
And again when the island of
Samos launched a dangerous
rebellion back and forth

465
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:07,610
40 Pericles took personal charge acting
promptly and decisively in catching the

466
00:38:10,051 --> 00:38:13,300
same year and rebels unprepared
for his swift reaction.

467
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,160
Taking them by surprise ultimately forcing
them to surrender by means of a naval

468
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:20,124
blockade.

469
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:26,580
These expeditions however show
that Pericles frequent caution.

470
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:32,970
Did not derive chiefly from
a temperamental tendency
or a character flaw but

471
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,930
from thought and calculation.

472
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,760
The main reason he avoided land battles
against their Spartan the Spartan and

473
00:38:45,551 --> 00:38:49,660
Peloponnesian allies is
because he was certain to lose.

474
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,990
The numbers were decisively against him.

475
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:59,460
Yet he was more careful then were bolder
generals no poets in the Greek world

476
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,730
was prodigal with its citizens in battle.

477
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:09,070
And it behooves the general especially
in a democratic state to keep the

478
00:39:09,071 --> 00:39:11,900
casualty lists as low as possible.

479
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:18,360
We need to remember that Athenian generals
were not only military leaders but

480
00:39:18,361 --> 00:39:23,361
also politicians who needed to be
re-elected to their posts every year

481
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:29,710
no doubt Pericles sincerely took pride
in the prudence and economy of his

482
00:39:29,711 --> 00:39:34,711
leadership but it could not have hurt
his political popularity when he boasted

483
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,040
to the Athenians.

484
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,480
What I've quoted before that as far
as it was in his power they would live

485
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,830
forever and be immortals.

486
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,570
Such considerations help explain
his cautious performance.

487
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,200
And yet there is no evidence to suggest
that he was one of those rare military

488
00:39:53,081 --> 00:39:57,490
geniuses who belong in
the ranks of Hannibal.

489
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:03,060
Caesar Alexander the Great a lesser but
still worthy example in our own time

490
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:10,320
George Patton who understand the limits
of rational calculation in war and the

491
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:17,371
need boldly to seize opportunity when
it offers proclaims was what a term that

492
00:40:20,341 --> 00:40:22,830
was used in the second world war.

493
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:28,340
A soldier's general as the PR forces of
Omar Bradley attached that title to him.

494
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,960
He was no George Patton or perhaps even
a Bernard Montgomery who seeks battle

495
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:42,910
only when the odds are
very heavily in his favor.

496
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:49,250
He lacked the flair and the boldness of
a claim on the daring and ruthlessness

497
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,710
that seeks victory at any cost.

498
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:59,520
Another element has been suggested to
explain the prickly in strategy Pericles

499
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:04,991
himself says one critic was rather an
admiral than a general the Athenian

500
00:41:06,141 --> 00:41:11,141
Admiralty it was which framed the strategy
at the outset of the war not Pericles

501
00:41:12,111 --> 00:41:17,111
the Borg Meister but proclaims the admiral
invented the strategy of exhaustion a

502
00:41:18,681 --> 00:41:23,270
strategy which came near to ruining Athens
in a couple of years and could never

503
00:41:23,271 --> 00:41:28,160
have won the victory. Well there
was some merit in this analysis.

504
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:33,670
The Athenians under Pericles had built
a grand strategy that was based on naval

505
00:41:34,131 --> 00:41:34,964
power.

506
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:40,330
That might seem to suit a maritime empire
whose homeland was an island such as

507
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:46,151
Great Britain's or a power that dominates
a continent and is separated from

508
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:51,791
other great powers by two great
oceans like the United States Athens

509
00:41:52,201 --> 00:41:56,880
geographical situation was not so
fortunate for the city was attached to the

510
00:41:56,881 --> 00:42:01,881
mainland offering targets of coercion
not available to the enemies of the great

511
00:42:02,341 --> 00:42:03,680
Anglo-Saxon countries.

512
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,720
Paris please try to cancel that
disadvantage by building the long walls

513
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,840
connecting the city to
its fortified harbour.

514
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:16,710
Thereby in effect turning
the city into an island.

515
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:22,780
It was an extraordinary strategy far
ahead of its time in its reliance on human

516
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:28,751
reason and technology and its rejection
of traditional ways of fighting that

517
00:42:29,691 --> 00:42:32,720
cost lives and gave
the enemy an advantage.

518
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:39,460
At the same time he abandoned all ideas
of further expansion and devised a

519
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:44,810
policy aimed at preserving
peace and the status quo.

520
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,170
That perfectly suited Athenian interests.

521
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:54,360
Such a policy dependent for success on
an extraordinary extraordinary amount of

522
00:42:55,751 --> 00:42:58,390
rationality on everyone's part.

523
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:05,210
The Athenians must be content with
what they have and abandon hopes for

524
00:43:05,821 --> 00:43:06,990
extension of their power.

525
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:11,070
There were always the
Athenians who objected to that.

526
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,880
But while he lived Pericles had the
wisdom and the political strength to

527
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,830
restrain and control them.

528
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:25,040
What he could not control were the
other states and especially the enemy.

529
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:31,040
Unexpected changes and shifts in power
are the normal condition of international

530
00:43:32,521 --> 00:43:33,354
history.

531
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:38,840
These changes have always taken place
because international relations are guided

532
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:44,270
only partially and spasmodic early
by rational calculations of material

533
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:46,343
advantage.

534
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:52,880
Always at work as well are
greed ambition jealousy.

535
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:01,340
Resentment anger hatred and facilities
famous triad fear honor and interest

536
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,840
in the world as it has been.

537
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:14,870
Therefore a state satisfied with its
situation and wishing to preserve peace

538
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:21,950
cannot rely on a reasoned export it
responds to its reason policies but must

539
00:44:23,281 --> 00:44:26,280
anticipate challenges
that seem unreasonable.

540
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:31,740
The Spartans and their allies ought
to have recognized that they had no

541
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:36,830
realistic strategy to promise victory
over Pericles reliance on defense and

542
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:42,831
refusal to fight a major land battle but
resentment and anger at Athenian power

543
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:50,020
and the fear that it might ultimately on
their mind their own alliance and their

544
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:52,120
security led them to fight.

545
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:58,470
As I find it usual in human history they
were more influenced by the memory of

546
00:45:00,371 --> 00:45:05,371
the Athenians failure to
fight a traditional battle
and negotiating a peace in

547
00:45:05,801 --> 00:45:10,801
forty forty six then by the recognition
that the new technology in the form of

548
00:45:12,761 --> 00:45:17,740
the long walls made it unnecessary for
Athens to risk such a battle in the

549
00:45:17,741 --> 00:45:18,574
future

550
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:24,150
to deter a war in such circumstances
which is what Pericles was trying to do

551
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:30,770
requires some offensive threat to the
pelican nations whose menace was great and

552
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:39,230
impossible to underestimate that would
make the fear of immediate consequences

553
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:44,340
of war stronger than all
the emotions leading to war.

554
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:50,240
But Pericles had come to think of
Athens as an invulnerable island.

555
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:57,070
Since the acquisition of a fleet of vast
treasury to support it and defensible

556
00:45:57,891 --> 00:46:02,891
walls for such a state to adopt
a defensive strategy is natural.

557
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:09,420
It had developed a unique and enviable
way of fighting that use these advantages

558
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:16,050
and avoided much of the
danger and unpleasantness of
ordinary warfare and allow

559
00:46:17,231 --> 00:46:22,231
the Athenians to concentrate their forces
quickly and attack islands and coastal

560
00:46:23,831 --> 00:46:25,480
enemies before they were prepared.

561
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:30,280
And it permitted them to strike others
without danger to their own city and

562
00:46:30,281 --> 00:46:32,460
population.
Success.

563
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:37,490
And this style of warfare made it seem
the only one necessary and defeats with

564
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:42,861
great losses on land made the Athenians
reluctant to take risks by fighting on

565
00:46:43,291 --> 00:46:44,124
land

566
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:50,180
offensive action in their views should
be taken as a last resort only only when

567
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:53,050
it was absolutely unavoidable.

568
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:59,660
Pericles carried this approach to its
logical conclusion by refusing to use a

569
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:05,901
land army even in defense of the homeland
much less by using it in offensive

570
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,970
efforts that might do
the enemy serious harm.

571
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,960
The enemy's passionate refusal to see
reason made what might be called the

572
00:47:19,141 --> 00:47:20,700
Athenian way of warfare.

573
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:26,270
Inadequate and Pericles strategy a form
of wishful thinking that failed for a

574
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,240
state like Athens in 431.

575
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:36,590
Satisfied with the situation capable of
keeping the enemy at bay the temptation

576
00:47:37,171 --> 00:47:39,870
to avoid the risks of
offensive action is great.

577
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:45,710
But as people often don't
notice it contains great
dangers it tends to create a

578
00:47:47,221 --> 00:47:52,221
rigid way of thinking that leads men to
apply a previously successful strategy

579
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:57,840
or one supported by a general theory
to a situation in which it is not

580
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:58,674
appropriate.

581
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:04,430
But it may have other disadvantages as
well its capacity to deter potential

582
00:48:04,951 --> 00:48:08,520
enemies from provoking a
war is severely limited.

583
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:14,180
Deterrence by standing behind a strong
defensive position and thereby depriving

584
00:48:14,181 --> 00:48:15,860
the enemy of the chance of victory.

585
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:21,460
A suit assumes a very high degree of
rationality and some degree of imagination

586
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:29,350
on the part of the enemy Spartans invaded
attic and 430 1 They must have thought

587
00:48:29,871 --> 00:48:34,871
they were risking little even if the
Athenians refused to fight even if they

588
00:48:35,061 --> 00:48:37,700
persisted in that refusal for a long time.

589
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:41,270
Both of which they thought
was unlikely and unnatural.

590
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:46,550
The Spartans would still be risking
little more than time and effort.

591
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:52,810
In any case their lands and city would
be safe had the Athenians possessed the

592
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:59,541
capacity to strike where the enemy was
vulnerable and had that capacity been

593
00:49:00,841 --> 00:49:01,950
obvious to everybody.

594
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:06,390
Pericles strategy of deterrence
might have been effective

595
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:08,740
once the war came.

596
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:13,570
There was no way to win without
abandoning the Athenian way of war and the

597
00:49:13,571 --> 00:49:18,571
parrot clan strategy as Pericles
lay dying in the fall of 429.

598
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:24,660
His strategy was a failure after three
campaigning seasons the Peloponnesian

599
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,620
showed no signs of exhaustion of any kind.

600
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:34,650
On the contrary they had just lately
refused an Athenian offer of peace and

601
00:49:35,621 --> 00:49:39,250
fought on with a determination to
destroy Athenian power forever.

602
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:44,620
The Athenians on the other hand had
seen their lands and homes ravaged

603
00:49:44,621 --> 00:49:48,040
repeatedly their crops and
trees burnt and destroyed.

604
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:52,990
They were also suffering from the plague
which was killing great numbers of them

605
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:58,290
and destroying their moral fiber in
the anecdote that I be I quoted at the

606
00:49:59,021 --> 00:50:00,520
beginning of this talk.

607
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:05,580
Plutarch speaks of Pericles response
to the praise of his military prowess.

608
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,100
You'll remember he expressed astonishment.

609
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:13,300
You know they thought he was sleeping
it turned out he wasn't he was hearing

610
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,134
what they were saying.

611
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:19,270
He expressed astonishment that they
should be praising what was the result of

612
00:50:19,271 --> 00:50:24,271
good fortune as much as his own talents
and what many others had accomplished.

613
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:31,320
Instead he said they should be praising
the finest and the most important of his

614
00:50:32,801 --> 00:50:37,801
claims to greatness that no Athenian
now alive has put on mourning clothes

615
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,270
because of me.
That assertion.

616
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:51,780
The last words of Pericles reported to
us must have astounded his audience.

617
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:58,450
Even his friends would have had to
admit that his policy had contributed at

618
00:50:58,451 --> 00:51:03,430
least something to the coming of the war
and that his strategy had something to

619
00:51:03,431 --> 00:51:07,480
do with the intensity of the
destruction caused by the play.

620
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:13,920
His final words show deeply how he felt
the wounds caused by the widespread

621
00:51:16,451 --> 00:51:21,451
accusations hurled against him
and his stubborn refusal to admit.

622
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,130
That he had been wrong in any way.

623
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:30,670
He had applied his great intelligence
to his city's needs and reason told him

624
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:36,230
that he was not responsible for the
results which he must have believed to be

625
00:51:36,231 --> 00:51:36,830
temporary.

626
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:41,830
He must have thought in
time his expectations would
be fulfilled if his fellow

627
00:51:43,511 --> 00:51:45,850
citizens would have
the wisdom and courage.

628
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,030
To hold to his strategy
they would win out.

629
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:54,900
So he believed and so did his contemporary
facilities more than two millennia

630
00:51:56,981 --> 00:51:57,814
later.

631
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,170
Clausewitz saw war through
very different eyes.

632
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,500
I quote him.
War.

633
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,860
Is more than a true chameleon.

634
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:15,150
That slightly shapes its characteristics
to the given case as a total

635
00:52:15,331 --> 00:52:16,164
phenomenon.

636
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:21,680
Its dominant tendencies always make
war a paradoxical trinity composed of

637
00:52:24,031 --> 00:52:29,031
primordial violence hatred and enmity
which are to be regarded as a blind

638
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:37,790
natural force of the play of chance and
probability within which the creative

639
00:52:39,211 --> 00:52:44,211
spirit is free to roam and its elements
of subordination as an instrument of

640
00:52:45,521 --> 00:52:50,521
policy which makes it subject to reason
alone these three tendencies are like

641
00:52:53,091 --> 00:52:54,980
three different codes of law.

642
00:52:55,820 --> 00:53:00,740
Deep rooted in their subject and yet
variable in their relationship to one

643
00:53:00,741 --> 00:53:01,574
another.

644
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:07,080
A theory that ignores any one of them or
seeks to fix an arbitrary relationship

645
00:53:08,181 --> 00:53:13,181
between them would conflict with reality
to such an extent that for this reason

646
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:17,510
alone it would be totally useless

647
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:24,120
like most generals in history and unlike
its few military geniuses Pericles saw

648
00:53:26,591 --> 00:53:31,591
war as essentially a linear phenomenon
subject as Clausewitz said to reason

649
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:38,080
alone and too little in my judgment.

650
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,870
Did he understand its other aspects.

651
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:45,880
For that he and his people
paid a very great price.

652
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:47,590
OK.

653
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:52,590
Well we do have some time and I'd be very
glad to hear any questions or comments

654
00:53:52,891 --> 00:53:54,040
and any of you would like to make.

655
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:57,280
After all we only have
a twenty seven year war.

656
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:01,960
We got 20 minutes to talk about it. No
problem. Anybody have anything to say.

657
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,150
Yes.
Why is.

658
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:11,290
This way writers of antiquity
works to harness that power.

659
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:12,993
Why was it in the.

660
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:18,300
That's a fairly long story but I think
the best answer I can give is the one I

661
00:54:18,301 --> 00:54:23,301
gave yesterday last time when I spoke
about Cincinnati's reasons for writing the

662
00:54:24,031 --> 00:54:25,320
story that he did.

663
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:31,040
He had been a supporter of Pericles
and things hadn't worked out well.

664
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:36,990
The state had gone in a direction very
different from the one that he favored

665
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,800
including a strategy that
was the opposite of Pericles.

666
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:45,780
The average guy in the street who was a
guy that he didn't approve of very much

667
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:47,700
thought wrongly Heath.

668
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,760
He believed that Pericles had been right
had been dead wrong was Pericles fault

669
00:54:52,951 --> 00:54:56,700
they went to war was powerful his
fault they lost the war and facilities

670
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:02,120
associated himself I think with Pericles
and his approach to things and so he

671
00:55:02,281 --> 00:55:04,530
had to make the case that he
believed the case he made.

672
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:07,110
I mean it's very important to realize that

673
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:13,110
and Plutarch coming many centuries
later like everybody who has ever spoken

674
00:55:13,111 --> 00:55:17,700
about the Peloponnesian War once their
cities had written was powerfully

675
00:55:17,701 --> 00:55:19,510
influenced by three cities.

676
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:24,210
I think just about everybody who's ever
considered the war has come away pretty

677
00:55:24,211 --> 00:55:26,650
much with facilities
judgment of these things.

678
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:28,280
So I think that's the answer to that

679
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,860
somebody will handle. No
I imagine the hand yes.

680
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:56,080
The question is can I think of any modern
generals who did use Pericles approach

681
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,150
as a model.

682
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:03,830
I think the answer is not anybody.
Well yeah.

683
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:05,450
General McClellan

684
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:11,360
in the civil war and it was
a very analogous situation.

685
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:15,050
McClellan did not want
to fight Lee's army.

686
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:19,250
He wasn't all that crazy about
the antislavery stuff anyway.

687
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:24,280
But apart from that he didn't want to pay
the price which was a tremendous price

688
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:26,840
of fighting the Civil War.

689
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:31,340
And so he wanted to avoid battle and
pretty much Lincoln couldn't get him to

690
00:56:31,341 --> 00:56:32,174
fight.

691
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,180
So
that was.

692
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:40,040
That's one example now this the next
the next thing I would offer you as

693
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,370
something to chew on at least it because
it's not identical it's only similar.

694
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,720
I think the the strategy undertaken by
the secretary of defense and the current

695
00:56:55,601 --> 00:57:00,601
administration in launching the attacks
on Afghanistan and on Persia Persian

696
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:05,823
Iraq.

697
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:11,080
I got Greeks I got Greeks on my mind.
I have to fight Persians.

698
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,300
Iraq reflected an aspect of it.

699
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:21,900
They would both for reasons I don't have
to explain to you desperately eager to

700
00:57:22,661 --> 00:57:25,600
reduce casualties to a minimum.

701
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,470
And they were desperately eager to.

702
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:36,180
Choose a an an approach that would
limit the time that the war lasted.

703
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:42,120
Because of the political situation in
the last decades in American history and

704
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:46,840
they had an advantage technologically

705
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,800
that seemed to make that possible.

706
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:56,670
America's fantastic advantage in
firepower and the capacity to deliver the

707
00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:02,790
firepower at a distance with very little
risk to the deliverers with the notion

708
00:58:05,261 --> 00:58:08,680
of doing tremendous
harm when it got there.

709
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,980
But you I don't know if any
of you remember any of this.

710
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:13,860
Some of you were too young to
even think about it I guess.

711
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,290
But originally remember what
was that phrase that they had.

712
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:20,860
What was that great strategy we were going
to use by bombing the hell out of the

713
00:58:20,861 --> 00:58:21,694
Iraqis.

714
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:23,800
Shock and Awe.
It was the same thing.

715
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:27,330
Shock and all was meant to say Oh my
God this is gonna happen to us we quit.

716
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:33,420
Was what they had in mind
and they deliberately chose
not to have ground forces

717
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:41,850
that would have been capable of doing
the kinds of things that it turns out you

718
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:47,120
need to do to be successful in
these wars just like other wars.

719
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:48,560
So the end.

720
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:53,560
And when it happened that it was clear
things were not working out according to

721
00:58:53,741 --> 00:58:54,574
their plan.

722
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:59,790
They stubbornly clung to that plan even
as the evidence was that it wasn't going

723
00:59:00,391 --> 00:59:03,970
to work. So that would be a
candidate I'd suggest. Yes.

724
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:05,833
Yeah.

725
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,220
A little bit louder please.

726
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:27,920
A
Yeah.

727
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:29,083
The question is do I.

728
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:34,180
Do I think that the recent Athenian
history or the structure of the democratic

729
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:38,390
society. Democracy had anything to
do with the adoption of this plant.

730
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,390
Perhaps.
You're absolutely right.

731
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:46,810
There must have been a very clear and
painful memory of what happened to

732
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,610
Thomas's when he invaded Bosnia.

733
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:52,910
There were very very heavy
casualties there for the Athenians.

734
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:54,620
That's the only one in
which they did have a.

735
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:59,480
But they did have those and they were
unusual so that it may have persuaded

736
00:59:59,481 --> 01:00:02,750
Pericles that the Athenian
people would find it hard.

737
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,750
But on balance I really think not.

738
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:10,550
I don't think that the Athenian
democracy was very different from the

739
01:00:10,551 --> 01:00:15,551
oligarchies of the other Greek cities in
the way they thought about things they

740
01:00:16,011 --> 01:00:17,930
would have much preferred to fight it out.

741
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:23,330
It was only Pericles incredible command
of the political situation that allowed

742
01:00:23,331 --> 01:00:27,380
him to take the strategy that people
had what the world is this guy doing.

743
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:31,160
And they turned against it very swiftly.

744
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,360
So no I don't think that democracy
was especially important now.

745
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:39,910
The enemies of Pericles and the enemies
of democracy I should say the enemy of

746
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:40,550
Americans.

747
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:45,550
I mean the ancient enemies of democracy
do say that it was the Athenian

748
01:00:45,681 --> 01:00:50,681
democracies way of running the war which
guaranteed disaster and they fixed on

749
01:00:52,011 --> 01:00:53,840
something that comes later down the road.

750
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:59,290
The Sicilian expedition which was a
dangerous undertaking as it turned out

751
01:01:00,891 --> 01:01:04,520
although these things didn't think
so at the time and they think only a

752
01:01:04,521 --> 01:01:09,521
democracy could have done anything as
stupid as that and they are in that way

753
01:01:10,461 --> 01:01:13,260
following precisely what lucidity says.

754
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:18,800
But if you read my account you'll see
that is another way of looking at it but

755
01:01:18,801 --> 01:01:22,220
that that's what the ancient
anti-democratic view was.

756
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:25,940
Democracies are idiots they don't know
how to conduct war do anything else right.

757
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:30,590
They will bring disaster. I think
you can get disaster a lot of ways.

758
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:31,983
Julieta

759
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:37,960
and yet we know that Turkey
was only one of my generals.

760
01:01:38,290 --> 01:01:40,680
So my question was Is
there any evidence that the

761
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:47,930
yet.

762
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:48,763
No.

763
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:53,030
It's very clear that so long as Pericles
was in charge everybody did what

764
01:01:53,031 --> 01:01:54,530
Pericles wanted done.

765
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:59,830
Part of the reason was that we know pretty
well from the evidence that at least

766
01:02:01,431 --> 01:02:04,940
a good number of the 10
generals in any one year were.

767
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:10,770
Close to Pericles so that his
political influence spread.

768
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:14,710
Very unusual thing in the
ancient world for any body.

769
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:18,970
In ancient Athens for anybody to have
that kind of a carry over effect.

770
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:22,750
But we see there's always several generals
that we know are friends of Pericles

771
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:28,150
and I think the rest of the story is
that you see the generals don't get to

772
01:02:28,151 --> 01:02:32,350
decide what they do. In ancient Athens
this is the part that blows your mind

773
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:38,950
when you send an army out that Army gets
a general or more it gets an assigned

774
01:02:40,551 --> 01:02:45,170
amount of money and equipment
and stuff and it gets orders.

775
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:50,570
And all of those things are decided by
the Assembly after a debate by a majority

776
01:02:50,571 --> 01:02:51,404
vote.

777
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:55,970
And what I would suggest to you is
that Pericles did not lose any of those

778
01:02:55,971 --> 01:03:00,680
arguments except in the one case when
they came after him and nail them and then

779
01:03:00,681 --> 01:03:03,770
they put him back in office again.
So does that take care of your question.

780
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:04,810
That's a good yeah.

781
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:06,133
Heather

782
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:17,180
you probably didn't
want to have just gone.

783
01:03:24,350 --> 01:03:25,183
Yeah.

784
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:29,840
The question the heart of the question
is why was apparently it wise to adopt a

785
01:03:29,841 --> 01:03:33,410
strategy no matter how good a strategy
it might have been which he knew the

786
01:03:33,411 --> 01:03:36,110
Athenians didn't like.
And I think the answer.

787
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,270
Well in the end the outcome is obvious.

788
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:43,300
No he wasn't wise but that's I think more
because the strategy was faulty not so

789
01:03:43,701 --> 01:03:46,250
much because the Athenians didn't like it.

790
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:50,780
He had proven over the years and he
proved now in the most delicate of times

791
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:55,280
that essentially he could
get the Athenians to do
what he wanted to do whether

792
01:03:55,281 --> 01:03:59,010
in fact they liked it to begin with
or not. He persuaded them to do it.

793
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:01,550
So I don't think that was really a flaw.

794
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:05,810
The problem was that things
went wrong almost immediately.

795
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:11,360
And then such terrible
things were happening as did
shake his power for a while.

796
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:16,670
But even then he came back into power
and still the strategy wasn't working.

797
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:20,990
I think the problem therefore I think
you could say he knew what he was doing.

798
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:25,700
He thought he could get away with it and
he could have if the strategy had been

799
01:04:25,701 --> 01:04:26,534
correct.

800
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:41,340
You know to start with you.
Uh uh uh.

801
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:44,310
People from the different

802
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:52,043
Oh yes.

803
01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:58,440
Yes.
The question is

804
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:03,030
ancient writers Plutarch is whom
you're really talking about.

805
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:09,800
They give Pericles credit for being a
great general but they say bad things

806
01:05:10,261 --> 01:05:15,000
about Nicholas who was involved
in the great defeat in Sicily.

807
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:16,763
And yet

808
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:22,440
Nicholas pursued something like the
strategy of Pericles which was avoiding

809
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,540
these conflicts.
Well I think

810
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:30,540
first thing I want to point out
is that subsidies didn't do that.

811
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:36,260
Not only this facilities so thoroughly
support the strategy of Pericles he

812
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:41,890
writes and in incoming him on the death
of Nicholas that raises him to the level

813
01:05:43,321 --> 01:05:46,260
of Pericles or higher
in his own estimation.

814
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:52,940
But in the case of Nicholas it was in
a way even worse than what Pericles did

815
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:59,750
because Nicholas first of all was against
the war against going to Sicily in the

816
01:05:59,761 --> 01:06:00,594
first place.

817
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:04,890
Then when he was chosen
to be general he went.

818
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:10,580
But before he did that he tried to
convince the having lost the vote shall we

819
01:06:11,581 --> 01:06:12,414
go.

820
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:17,430
He then decided to trick the Athenians
into not going any way by saying to them

821
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:21,720
oh well if you're going to go all right
but it'll be perfectly safe if you just

822
01:06:21,990 --> 01:06:23,760
sort of take this.

823
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:28,000
The original fleet was going
to have 60 ships period.

824
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:33,600
Well it ended up having
130 ships 5000 hop lights

825
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:40,190
raising the risk of that thing to the
level that finally made it seem like they

826
01:06:41,521 --> 01:06:46,020
could lose the war by losing the
Sicilian campaign. And he didn't.

827
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,170
The Athenians instead of saying
which what he expected. Oh no no.

828
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:53,340
If that's what we have to do let's not go.
Instead they said Right on.

829
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,130
Yes you can have everything you ask
for Nick is what would you like.

830
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,073
And off they went.

831
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:03,560
And thereafter his performance on that
expedition is one of somebody who doesn't

832
01:07:04,321 --> 01:07:06,180
really want to carry out his instructions.

833
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:10,520
He just what he would have liked to
do was having lost the argument twice.

834
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:15,570
Now he went out and did everything he
could to avoid confronting any battle in

835
01:07:16,441 --> 01:07:21,441
Syracuse and was finally driven to fight
at Syracuse very much against his will.

836
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:28,890
And then I could you know go back and
read it but he screws up the detail of it

837
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:30,750
over and over again.

838
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:36,980
And so I think there are good grounds
for condemning him as a general whereas

839
01:07:39,841 --> 01:07:44,841
the grounds on which Pericles should be
criticized I think is as a strategist

840
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:51,380
rather than as a commander
anybody else.

841
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:52,883
Yeah.

842
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:00,223
No.

843
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:01,940
But I think they.

844
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:07,550
Well I'll make one little exception to
that but I I think they could have had a

845
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:12,440
very good chance to come out of the war
in the way Pericles hoped they would if

846
01:08:12,441 --> 01:08:17,441
they had pursued the limited aggressive
program that was undertaken by Clinton

847
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:21,770
in Damascus and these after
the death of Pericles.

848
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:27,130
So taking pilots building afforded pylons
taking Cicero building a fourth there

849
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:33,700
and perhaps even a few other places on
the periphery of the Peloponnese and

850
01:08:33,801 --> 01:08:38,801
launching attacks from those places but
not staying to fight the Spartans at any

851
01:08:39,441 --> 01:08:44,441
great battle just causing that to happen
if they had been able to do that for a

852
01:08:44,451 --> 01:08:49,451
stretch of time then the hope that Clay
on had that the headlights might escape

853
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:55,510
to these forts and that then ultimately
bring about an internal upheaval which

854
01:08:56,121 --> 01:08:59,510
the Spartans panic might happen would have

855
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:05,400
led the Spartans to offer peace and in
fact they do the Spartans off peace many

856
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:09,950
many. You could argue that
if the Athenians had simply
accepted the Spartan peace

857
01:09:09,951 --> 01:09:14,951
offer in for twenty five the war would
have been over and the Athenian Empire

858
01:09:15,111 --> 01:09:17,660
would've been intact just
the way Pericles wanted it.

859
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:22,010
So not only could they have done it they
would have done it if they'd accepted

860
01:09:22,011 --> 01:09:25,460
it. They wouldn't accept victory you
could argue as many a scholar does.

861
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:29,620
You have the only other point I want
to make is after that didn't happen and

862
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:34,630
finally a peace was drawn up and signed
then in effect in 421 which is another

863
01:09:35,301 --> 01:09:39,110
evidence that they could achieve what
they wanted by the techniques that were

864
01:09:39,111 --> 01:09:39,944
put forward.

865
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:44,480
But after that happened that peace
broke down and now the Athenians found

866
01:09:44,481 --> 01:09:49,481
themselves part of a new alliance of
states Peloponnese as Athenians with three

867
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:56,800
Peloponnesian democracies who produce
a big land battle in the Peloponnese.

868
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:03,920
And the Athenians come that I mean the
enemies of Sparta come that close to

869
01:10:03,921 --> 01:10:06,550
defeating the Spartan army
in the Peloponnesian War.

870
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:11,810
Had they done that they would
have finished Sparta off
as a dominant power grid.

871
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:15,830
So the answer is they they actually had
it in their hands a couple of times and

872
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:19,490
in another time they missed by about an
inch. Yeah. They could've won that way.

873
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:24,270
I think we're out of time. Let me wish
you all a very happy holiday. Bye bye.
