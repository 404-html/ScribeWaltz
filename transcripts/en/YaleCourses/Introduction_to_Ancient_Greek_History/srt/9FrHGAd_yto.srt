1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,470
No,
I'm going to ask you this question.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,720
Why are you here?
That is to say,

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,640
why should you,

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,670
we all of us want to study
these ancient Greeks.

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,390
I think it's reasonable for people who
are considering the study of a particular

6
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:27,510
subject in a college course
to ask why they should.

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,520
What is it about the ancient Greeks
between the years that I mentioned to you

8
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,390
that deserves the attention
of people in the 21st century?

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,700
I think the answer is to be
found or at least one answer.

10
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:42,361
The truth is,

11
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:47,250
there are many answers into some of
them is it's just terribly interesting,

12
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,760
but that's very much of a, uh, uh,

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,610
what's the word I want
the opposite of objective,

14
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,160
subjective observation by me.

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:02,240
So I would say a less objective one is
that I believe that it comes from their

16
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:06,750
position that is to stay the
position of the Greeks at the most,

17
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,740
the most significant starting
point of Western civilization,

18
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,870
which is the culture that most
powerfully shapes not only the west,

19
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,820
but most of the world today.

20
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,830
It seems to me be the evidence that
whatever it's other characteristics.

21
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,190
The West has created institutions
of government and law that provide

22
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,830
unprecedented freedom for its people.

23
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,490
It's also invented a body of natural
scientific knowledge and technological

24
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:46,551
achievement that together make
possible a level of health and material

25
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:52,851
prosperity undreamed of in earlier times
and unknown outside the West and those

26
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:57,720
places that have been
influenced by the West.

27
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,180
I think the Nobel Prize
Laureate v as Nepal,

28
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,630
a man born in Trinidad of Indian parents
was right when he spoke of the modern

29
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:15,501
world as our universal civilisation
shaped chiefly by the West.

30
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,420
Most people around the world who
know of them want to benefit from the

31
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:27,780
achievements of western
science and technology.

32
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,570
Many of them also want to
participate in its political freedom.

33
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:35,940
Moreover,

34
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,940
experienced suggests that a society cannot
achieve the full benefits of western

35
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:46,851
science and technology without a
commitment to reason and objectivity as

36
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:54,351
essential to knowledge and
to the political freedom
that sustains it and helps

37
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:57,000
it to move forward.

38
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,900
The primacy reason and the
pursuit of objectivity.

39
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:06,901
Therefore both characteristic of the
Western experience seemed to me to be

40
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:13,141
essential for the achievement
of the desired goals almost
anywhere in the world.

41
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,110
The civilization of the West,
however,

42
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,650
was not the result of some inevitable
process through which other cultures will

43
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,450
automatically pass.

44
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:31,050
It emerged from a unique history in
which chance and accidents often played a

45
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:33,304
vital part.

46
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,160
The institutions and the ideas
therefore that provide for freedom and

47
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:44,161
improvement in the material conditions
of life cannot take root and flourish

48
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,420
without an understanding of how they
came about and what challenges they have

49
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:50,680
had to surmount.

50
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,410
Nonwestern peoples who wish to share and
the things that characterize modernity.

51
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,810
We'll need to study the ideas and history
of Western civilization to achieve

52
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:05,380
what they want and westerners,
I would argue,

53
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,580
who wished to preserve these
things must do the same.

54
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,950
The many civilizations adopted by
the human race have shared basic

55
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,920
characteristics.

56
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:23,730
Most have tended toward cultural
uniformity and stability reason.

57
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:31,170
Although it was employed for all sorts
of practical and intellectual purposes in

58
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:32,590
some of these cultures,

59
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,430
it still lacked independence from
religion and it lacked the high status to

60
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:42,340
challenge the most basic received ideas.

61
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,660
Standard form of government has
been monarchy outside the west.

62
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,660
Republics have been unknown.

63
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,580
Rulers have been thought to be divine
or appointed spokesmen for divinity.

64
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,750
Religious and political institutions
and beliefs have been thoroughly

65
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:09,730
intertwined as a mutually supportive,
unified structure.

66
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:16,170
Government has not been subject
to secular reasoned analysis.

67
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,090
It has rested on religious authority,
tradition and power.

68
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:28,140
The concept of individual freedom
has had no importance in these,

69
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,500
uh, the great majority of
cultures of in human history.

70
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,760
The first and the sharpest break with
this common human experience came in

71
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:40,210
ancient Greece.

72
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,560
The Greek city states called
police were republics.

73
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,550
Differences in wealth among their
citizens were relatively small.

74
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,840
There were no kings with the
wealth to hire mercenary soldiers.

75
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,050
So the citizens had to do their own
fighting and to decide when to fight as

76
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:06,340
independent defenders of the common
safety and the common interest.

77
00:06:06,341 --> 00:06:11,341
They demanded a role in the most
important political decisions in this way.

78
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:16,220
For the first time political
life really was invented,

79
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:20,780
observed that the word political
derives from the Greek word Polis.

80
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,590
Before that no word was needed
because there was no such thing.

81
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,050
This political life came to be shared
by a relatively large portion of the

82
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:35,051
people and participation in political
life was highly valued by the Greeks.

83
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,790
Such states of course did not
need a bureaucracy for their one,

84
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:45,791
no vast royal or state holdings that
needed management and not much economic

85
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:51,170
surplus to support a bureaucratic class.

86
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:57,070
There was no separate cast of priests
and there was very little concern.

87
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:02,120
I don't mean no concern, but very
little concern with life after death,

88
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,600
which was universally important than other
civilizations in this varied dynamic,

89
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,830
secular and remarkably free context.

90
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:18,310
There are rose for the first time a
speculative natural philosophy based on

91
00:07:19,611 --> 00:07:21,440
observation and reason.

92
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,400
The roots of modern natural science and
philosophy free to investigate or to

93
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:31,970
ignore divinity.

94
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,380
What most sets the Greeks apart is their
view of the world where other people's

95
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,450
have seen sameness and continuity.

96
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,330
The Greeks and the heirs
have their way of thinking,

97
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:49,790
have tended to notice disjunctions
and to make distinctions.

98
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,750
The Greek way of looking
at things requires a change
from the characteristic way

99
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:58,040
of knowing things before the Greeks.

100
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,220
That is to say the use of faith,

101
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,990
poetry and intuition,
and instead,

102
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,980
increasingly the Greeks focused
on a reliance on reason,

103
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,200
reason,
permits,

104
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,620
a continuing rational inquiry
into the nature of reality.

105
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,020
Unlike mystical insights,

106
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:26,510
scientific theories can not be
arrived at by meditation alone,

107
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,110
but require accurate observation of the
world and reasoning of a kind that other

108
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:38,630
human beings can
criticize, analyze, modify,

109
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,860
and correct.

110
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,300
The adoption of this way of thinking
was the beginning of the liberation and

111
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:51,980
enthronement of reason to WHO's searching.
Examination,

112
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:57,010
the Greeks thereafter exposed
everything they perceived natural,

113
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,760
human and divine
from the top,

114
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,830
from the time they formed their republics,

115
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:07,290
until they were conquered
by alien empires.

116
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,360
The Greeks also rejected
monarchy of any kind.

117
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:17,540
They thought that a human
being functioning in his
full capacity must live as a

118
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:23,001
free man in an autonomous Polis ruled
by laws that were the product of the

119
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:31,701
political community and not have an
arbitrary Fiat from some man or God.

120
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,700
These are ideas about laws and justice
that have simply not flourished outside

121
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,160
the western tradition,
uh,

122
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,700
until places where that were
outside the western tradition.

123
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:51,210
We're influenced by the
West. The Greeks, however,

124
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:56,211
combined a unique sense of mankind's
high place in the natural order.

125
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The Greeks had the most arrogant view of
their relationship to the divinity is I

126
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:05,820
will tell you about later in
the course of any people I know.

127
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,640
So on the one hand, they had this very
high picture of this place of mad,

128
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,990
but they combined it,
excuse me,

129
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:15,600
and what possibilities human
beings head before that.

130
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:22,670
And they combined it with a painful
understanding of the limitations of the

131
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:28,380
greatness and the Paul,
the possibilities before Matt.

132
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:34,250
This combination of elevating the
greatness in reality and in possibility of

133
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:40,710
human beings with the limitations of it.
One,

134
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:45,780
the greatest limitation being mortality
that together composes the tragic vision

135
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:53,510
of the human condition that characterized
classical Greek civilization to cope

136
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:56,100
with it.

137
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:01,100
They urged human beings to restrain
their overarching ambitions inscribed at

138
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:07,950
Apollo's temple at Delphi,
which became,

139
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:12,540
well the Greeks came to call
it the navel of the universe,

140
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:17,690
but it certainly became the center of the
Greek world and which was also seen as

141
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:22,800
a central place of importance
by non Greeks who were on
the borders of the Greek

142
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:27,660
world, uh, that that temple of
Delphi had written above the temple.

143
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,900
These words know thyself
and another statement,

144
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,310
nothing in excess.

145
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,730
I think those together really mean this.

146
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,120
Know your own limitations as a fallible
mortal and then exercise moderation

147
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,200
because you are not divine.

148
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,520
You are mortal beyond these exhortations.

149
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:58,710
They relied on a good political regime
to enable human beings to fulfill the

150
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,480
capacities that was part of that.

151
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:06,481
We're part of their nature to train
them in virtue and to restrain them from

152
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:12,661
vice Aristotle and his politics made the
point neatly and I quote him as a man,

153
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:19,060
I'm sorry, as man is the best
of the animals. Went perfected,

154
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,780
so he is the worst when separated from
law and justice for injustice is most

155
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:32,071
dangerous when it is armed and man armed
by nature with good sense and virtue

156
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,470
may use them for entirely opposite ends.
Therefore,

157
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,450
if when he is without virtue,

158
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,550
man is the most unscrupulous
and savage of the animals

159
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,360
are went on to say that the justice
needed to control this dark side of human

160
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:57,361
nature can be found only in a well
ordered society of free people who govern

161
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:04,360
themselves and the only one that he
knew was the polis of the Greeks.

162
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,640
Now the second great strand in the
history of the West is the Judeo Christian

163
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,203
tradition.

164
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,590
A very different tradition from
the one I've just described.

165
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:23,730
Christianity's main routes where in
Judaism a religion that worshiped a single

166
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:30,151
all powerful deity who is
sharply separated from human
beings makes great moral

167
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:35,680
demands upon them and judges them all.

168
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,020
Even kings and emperors.

169
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:44,130
Christianity began as a
persecuted religion that
ultimately captured the Roman

170
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:50,131
empire only after centuries of
hostility towards the empire,

171
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,050
towards Rome,
towards the secular state in general,

172
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,950
and it never lost entirely.

173
00:13:56,951 --> 00:14:01,951
It's original character as an insurgent
movement independent of the state and

174
00:14:02,831 --> 00:14:07,360
hostile to it, making claims that
challenged the secular authority.

175
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,700
This too is unique to the west,
just like the Greek experiences unique.

176
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:18,180
This kind of religious organization
is to be found nowhere else in human

177
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:19,864
society.

178
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:25,830
So the Union of a universalist religion
with a monarch such as the Roman empire,

179
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,670
who ruled a vast empire,

180
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:36,330
could nonetheless have put an end to
any prospect of freedom as in other

181
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:39,010
civilizations.

182
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,640
But Christianity's inheritance of the
rational disputatious Greek philosophy led

183
00:14:48,611 --> 00:14:53,611
to powerfully divisive about the nature
of God and other theological questions,

184
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:01,570
which was perfectly in the tradition
and uniquely in the tradition of Greek

185
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,770
philosophical debate.

186
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,970
What I'm doing is making a claim that
even the Judeo Christian tradition,

187
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:12,971
which is such a different one from the
Greeks and in so many ways seems to be at

188
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:13,970
odds with it,

189
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:19,090
even though they were dependent upon
one aspect of the Greek culture,

190
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:24,050
which is inherent in Christianity
and important and Christianity,

191
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,560
uh,
that too was ultimately a Greek source.

192
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,570
Well,

193
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,900
the people whom the Romans
called barbarians destroy
the western empire and it

194
00:15:34,941 --> 00:15:38,750
also destroyed the power of the emperors
and their efforts to impose religious

195
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,500
and political conformity
under imperial control.

196
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:47,300
The emperor in the east was able to do
that because they were not conquered by

197
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:48,134
the barbarians.

198
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,350
But in the West you have this situation
where nobody is fully in charge.

199
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:59,770
And here we have arrived at a second
sharp break with the general experience of

200
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:00,794
mankind,

201
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:06,700
the west of the Germanic tribes that had
toppled the Roman empire was weak and

202
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:09,500
under,
and it was divided.

203
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:15,100
The barriers to unity presented by
European geography and very limited

204
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:20,471
technology made it hard for would be
conqueror to create a vast empire,

205
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,870
eliminating competitors and
imposing his will over vast areas.

206
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:32,650
These conditions permitted the development
of institutions and habits needed for

207
00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:33,950
free freedom,

208
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:39,340
even as they also made Europe vulnerable
to conquest and to extinction and

209
00:16:39,681 --> 00:16:44,210
Europe was almost extinguished
practically before there was a Europe.

210
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,070
Very early in its history.

211
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,780
The Christian Church might have stepped
into the Breech and imposed obedience

212
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,960
and uniformity because
before terribly long,

213
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,690
all of the West had been Christianized,

214
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:05,530
but the church in fact never gained
enough power to control the state strong

215
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:10,040
enough to interfere with the
ambitions of emperors and kings.

216
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,610
It never was able to
impose its own domination.

217
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,690
Though some of the pope's short try,

218
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,810
nobody sought or plan for freedom,

219
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:27,170
but in the spaces that will left by the
endless conflicts among secular rulers

220
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,240
and between them and the church,

221
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,750
there was room for freedom to grow.

222
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,420
Freedom was the kind of an accident it
came about because the usual ways of

223
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:40,100
doing things were not possible

224
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,580
into some of that space.

225
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,120
Towns and cities reappeared and
with them new supports for freedom,

226
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,910
taking advantage of the
rivalries I've mentioned.

227
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:58,290
They obtained charters from the local
powers establishing their rights to

228
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:03,270
conduct their own affairs and
to govern themselves in Italy.

229
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,740
Some of these cities were able to gain
control of the surrounding country and to

230
00:18:07,741 --> 00:18:11,640
become city states resembling
those of the ancient Greeks.

231
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:17,450
Their autonomy was assisted by the
continuing struggle between popes and

232
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,450
emperors, between Church and state. Again,

233
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:26,580
a thoroughly unique western
experience in these states,

234
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,920
the modern world began to take form,

235
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,040
although the people
were mainly Christians,

236
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,400
they are life and outlook
became increasingly secular
here and not only in Italy

237
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:40,170
but in other cities.

238
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:45,171
North of the Alps arose a worldview that
celebrated the greatness and dignity of

239
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:47,334
mankind,

240
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,520
which was a very sharp turning away from
the medieval western tradition that put

241
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,510
God and life in the hereafter.
At the center of everything,

242
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:04,250
this New Vision is revealed with Flamboyan
confidence by Pico della Mirando,

243
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:10,510
la of Florentine thinker who said,
uh,

244
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,423
wrote the following,

245
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:16,850
God told man that we meaning God
have made thee neither of Heaven,

246
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,200
nor of earth,
neither mortal nor immortal.

247
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:27,950
So that with freedom of choice and with
honor as though the maker and molder of

248
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:30,300
thyself,

249
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:35,670
thou mayest fashion by myself in
whatever shape thou shalt prefer.

250
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,750
Oh su-preme generosity of God,

251
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:44,751
the father oh highest and the
most great Felicity of man.

252
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:46,830
To him,

253
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,920
it is granted to have whatever he
chooses to be whatever he wills.

254
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:55,471
Now,

255
00:19:55,471 --> 00:20:00,471
this is a remarkable leap even
beyond the humanism of the Greeks.

256
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:07,670
Something brand new in the world according
to this view of man is not merely the

257
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:14,451
measure of all things as the Greek sophos
Protagoras had radically proclaimed in

258
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:16,830
the fifth century.

259
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,530
He is in fact says Pico more than mortal.

260
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,560
He is unlimited by nature.

261
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:31,250
He is entirely free to shape himself
and to acquire whatever he wants.

262
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:38,630
Please observe too that it is not his
reason that will determine human actions,

263
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:44,390
but his will alone free of the
moderating control of reason.

264
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,200
Another Florentine Machiavelli moved
further in the same direction for him,

265
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,403
and I quote him.

266
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:58,770
Fortune is a woman and it is necessary
to hold her down and beat her and site

267
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:05,620
with her.
A notion that the Greeks,

268
00:21:05,621 --> 00:21:10,621
whatever regarded as dangerously
arrogant and certain to produce disaster,

269
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,090
it would have seen this as an example
of the word that they use and we'll talk

270
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:17,200
about a lot in this course.

271
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:22,470
Hubris is kind of violent arrogance
which comes upon men when they see

272
00:21:23,171 --> 00:21:27,370
themselves as more than human and
behave as though they were divine.

273
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,320
Francis Bacon influenced by Machiavelli
urged human beings to employ their

274
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:40,771
reason to force nature to give up its
secrets to treat nature like a woman to

275
00:21:42,371 --> 00:21:46,390
master nature in order to
improve man's material wellbeing.

276
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:51,940
He assumed that such a course with lead
to progress and the general improvement

277
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:52,870
of the human condition,

278
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,940
and it was that sort of thinking that
lay at the heart of the scientific

279
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:02,941
revolution and remains the faith on
which modern science and technology rest.

280
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,840
A couple of other English
political philosophers,

281
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:12,841
Hobbes and Locke applied a similar
novelty and maternity to the sphere of

282
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:14,014
politics.

283
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:19,350
Basing their understanding on the common
passions of men for a comfortable self

284
00:22:21,101 --> 00:22:25,930
preservation and discovering something
the Greeks had never thought of,

285
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,080
something they called natural rights
that belonged to a man either as part of

286
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:37,411
nature or as the gift of a
benevolent and reasonable God.

287
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,740
Man was seen as a solitary creature,

288
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,400
not inherently a part of society that's
totally on Greek and his basic rights

289
00:22:49,271 --> 00:22:52,990
were seen to be absolute for nothing,

290
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:56,920
must interfere with the right of
each individual to defend his life.

291
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,280
Liberty and property freedom was
threatened in early modern times by the

292
00:23:04,321 --> 00:23:07,930
merchants of monarchies that
might have been able to crush it.

293
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:13,770
But the cause of individual freedom was
enhanced by the Protestant reformation.

294
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,860
Another upheaval within Christianity
arising from its focus on individual

295
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:21,514
salvation.

296
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:27,210
It's inheritance of a
tradition of penetrating reason
applied even to matters of

297
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:32,740
faith and to the continuing
struggle between church and state.

298
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:38,790
The English revolution came about in
large part because of King Charles the

299
00:23:39,191 --> 00:23:44,191
first attempt to impose an alien
religious conformity as well as tighter

300
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:50,240
political control on his kingdom.
In England,

301
00:23:50,241 --> 00:23:55,040
the tradition of freedom and government
bound by law was already strong enough

302
00:23:55,310 --> 00:24:00,310
to produce effective resistance from
the ensuing rebellion came limited

303
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:05,831
constitutional representative government
and ultimately our modern form of

304
00:24:07,191 --> 00:24:11,510
democracy.
The example and the idea is that produced,

305
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:16,810
encouraged and informed the French and
the American revolutions and the entire

306
00:24:17,511 --> 00:24:19,310
modern constitutional tradition.

307
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,780
These ideas and institutions are the
basis for modern liberal thinking about

308
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:30,560
politics,
the individual and society.

309
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:36,100
Just as the confident view of science
and technology as progressive forces

310
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:41,650
improving the lot of
humanity and increasing man's
capacity to understand and

311
00:24:41,961 --> 00:24:46,961
control the universe has been the most
powerful form taken by the Western

312
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:51,500
elevation of reason in
the last two centuries.

313
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:56,980
Both these most characteristic elements
of western civilization have in fact

314
00:24:57,441 --> 00:25:02,441
become increasingly under heavy
attack at different times,

315
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:09,490
science and technology have been blamed
for the destruction of human community

316
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:15,610
and the alienation of people from nature
and from one another for intensifying

317
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:19,040
the gulf between rich and poor,

318
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:22,970
for threatening the very
existence of humanity,

319
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,580
either by producing weapons of total
destruction or by destroying the

320
00:25:28,581 --> 00:25:31,670
environment.
At the same time,

321
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:36,320
the foundations of freedom
have also come into question.

322
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:42,220
Jefferson and his colleagues
could confidently proclaim
their political rights

323
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:48,230
as being self evident and
the gift of a creator.

324
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,440
By now in our time,
however,

325
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:55,880
the power of religion
has faded and for many,

326
00:25:55,881 --> 00:26:00,380
the basis of modern political and
moral order has been demolished.

327
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:06,490
Nicha announced the death of God and
dusty Yefsky is grand inquisitor asserted

328
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:12,470
that when God is dead,
all things are permitted.

329
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,660
Nihilism,

330
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,430
rejects any objective basis
for society and it's morality.

331
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:25,270
It rejects the very concept of objectivity
and even rejects the possibility of

332
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:28,550
communication itself.

333
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:34,780
And a Volvo form of nihilism I claim
has a remarkable influence in our

334
00:26:35,451 --> 00:26:38,730
educational system today.
Uh,

335
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,560
the system rotting from the head
down so chiefly in universities,

336
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,050
but all the way down
to elementary schools.

337
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,980
The consequences of the
victory of such ideas,

338
00:26:49,981 --> 00:26:52,380
I believe would be enormous.

339
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,970
If both religion and reason are removed,

340
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:02,310
all that remains is will and power.
We're,

341
00:27:02,311 --> 00:27:06,510
the only law is the law of tooth and claw.

342
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:12,450
There is no protection for the freedom
of weaker individuals or those who

343
00:27:12,451 --> 00:27:15,390
questioned the authority
of the most powerful.

344
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:21,140
There is no basis for individual rights
or for a critique of existing ideas and

345
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:22,560
institutions.

346
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:27,780
If there is no base either
in religion or reason,

347
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,000
that's such a tax on the greatest
achievements of the West should be made by

348
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:34,380
western intellectuals,

349
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:38,580
is perfectly in keeping
with the western tradition,

350
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,490
the first crowd to do stuff like that.

351
00:27:41,491 --> 00:27:46,230
You will find in the fifth century
BC in Greece in a movement called the

352
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,640
sophistic movement.

353
00:27:47,641 --> 00:27:52,320
These sophos raised most of the questions
that my colleagues are now spending

354
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:55,800
all their time with now.
Yet to me,

355
00:27:55,801 --> 00:28:00,801
it seems ironic that they have
gained so much currency in a time,

356
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:03,660
more or less,
uh,

357
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:08,120
in which the achievements
of Western reason, uh,

358
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:11,580
and in the form of ancient
form of science and uh,

359
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,590
and at a moment when it's concept of
political freedom seem to be more popular

360
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:20,640
and more desirable to people in and
out of Western civilization than ever.

361
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,890
Now, I've been saying kind things
about Western civilization,

362
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:30,891
but I would not want to deny that there
is a dark side to the western experience

363
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:37,520
and its way of life to put untrammeled
reason and individual freedom at the

364
00:28:39,871 --> 00:28:44,871
center of a civilization is to live
with the conflict that turmoil,

365
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:50,760
the instability and the uncertainty
that these things create.

366
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:56,870
Freedom was born and has survived in the
space created by divisions and conflict

367
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:02,820
within and between nations and religions.

368
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,080
We must wonder whether the power of
modern weapons will allow it and the world

369
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:15,150
to survive at such a price
individual freedom,

370
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:19,200
although it has greatly elevated the
condition of the people who have lived in

371
00:29:19,201 --> 00:29:23,460
free societies inevitably
permits inequalities,

372
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:29,420
which are the more galling because each
person is plainly free to try to improve

373
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:33,480
his situation and largely
responsible for the outcome.

374
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,640
Freedom does,

375
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:40,820
does permit isolation from society and
an alienation of the individual at a high

376
00:29:42,311 --> 00:29:44,920
cost both to the individual and society.

377
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:51,090
And these are not the only problems posed
by the western tradition in its modern

378
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:52,930
form,
which is what we live in.

379
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:58,840
Whether it takes the shape of the
unbridled claims of Pico della Mirando,

380
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:01,620
La of the Nietzschean associate,
uh,

381
00:30:01,621 --> 00:30:06,621
assertion of the power of the superior
individual to transform and shape his own

382
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:13,051
nature or of the modern totalitarian
effort to change the nature of humanity by

383
00:30:15,971 --> 00:30:18,700
Utopian social engineer.

384
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,960
The temptation to arrogance offered by
the ideas and worldly success of the

385
00:30:26,261 --> 00:30:31,261
modern west threatens its own
great traditions and achievements

386
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,560
because of Western civilizations,

387
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:38,440
emergence as the eggs and
[inaudible] civilization.

388
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,130
It also presents problems
to the whole world.

389
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,070
The challenges presented by freedom and
the predominance of reason cannot be

390
00:30:48,071 --> 00:30:49,780
ignored.
No.

391
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:54,781
Can they be met by recourse to the
experience of other cultures where these

392
00:30:55,031 --> 00:30:58,690
characteristics have not been prominent?
In other words,

393
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:02,320
to understand and cope with
the problems that we all face,

394
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:06,670
we all need to know and to grapple
with the Western experience.

395
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:08,591
In my view,

396
00:31:08,591 --> 00:31:13,591
we need especially to examine
the older traditions of the West.

397
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:19,630
It came to for the modern era and to take
seriously the possibility that useful

398
00:31:21,101 --> 00:31:23,140
wisdom can be found there,

399
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,650
especially among the
Greeks who began at all.

400
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,700
They understood the
potentiality of human beings.

401
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:35,710
They are limitations and the
predicament in which they live.

402
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,740
Man is potent and important.

403
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:44,310
Yet he is fallible and mortal capable of
the greatest achievements and the worst

404
00:31:45,281 --> 00:31:48,640
crimes.
He is then a tragic figure,

405
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:52,780
powerful but limited with
freedom to choose an act,

406
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,600
but bound by his own nature,

407
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:01,470
knowing that he will never achieve perfect
knowledge and understanding justice

408
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:06,850
and happiness, but determined to
continue the search no matter what.

409
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:13,350
To me that seems an accurate description
of the human condition that is

410
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:18,640
meaningful, not only for the
Greeks and their heirs in the west,

411
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,620
but for all human beings.

412
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:26,340
It is an understanding that cannot be
achieved without a serious examination of

413
00:32:26,831 --> 00:32:28,090
the western experience.

414
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:33,870
The abandonment of such a study or
it's adulteration for current political

415
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:39,631
purposes would be a terrible loss
for all of humanity and at the base,

416
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:46,610
at the root of that
civilization stood the grapes.

417
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:53,410
These are the reasons why I examined
their experience and I trust why you are

418
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:59,360
thinking about learning about
it. Thank you. I'll see you guys.

419
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:01,550
Some of you next Tuesday.
