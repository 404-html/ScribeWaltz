1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,700
We have been looking at the question of
the rise of the Poles and the various

2
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:15,370
significant elements that were
part of the making of the poles.

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:20,890
And of course I've emphasized the notion
of this new class of people the former

4
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:25,723
hotplate

5
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:32,110
citizen as being the critical element
in shaping the poles and for my money.

6
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,040
That's what the Poles
is about to start with.

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,060
And then it develops characteristics
consistent with that and some that

8
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:43,280
challenge that over the centuries.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But now imagine that we are living in
the early years of the poles sometime in

10
00:00:50,271 --> 00:00:52,340
the 8th century B.C..

11
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,510
Again I want to emphasize these things
that I've been describing don't happen

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,440
every place at the same time and they
don't even happen every place in the same

13
00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:03,440
way.
But over a stretch of time

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,480
the concepts and the kind
of characteristics I've
been describing appear to

15
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:10,490
spread all over the place.

16
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,450
But one of the ways in which we can date
the time when the Poles came into being

17
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,100
has to do with the Greek traditions
about the establishment of colonies

18
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:33,270
throughout the Mediterranean inhabited
by Greeks and the reason that they are a

19
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:38,440
clue is because every time we see a
colony learn anything at all about it

20
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:45,090
it appears to exist in the form of a
polis which powerfully suggests that that

21
00:01:47,171 --> 00:01:52,171
was the sort of the typical characteristic
style of life that had already been

22
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:56,650
established for Greeks before
they sent out colonies.

23
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,890
So that's the chronological
significance of it all I should say.

24
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,950
All of these dates that I will be
giving you are some combination of Greek

25
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,900
tradition and the Greeks dated many in
many cases they dated these colonies very

26
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:18,400
specifically.

27
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,290
That would be hard to believe
impossible to believe I guess.

28
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,530
If it weren't that these dates tended to
be confirmed in a general way not in a

29
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:34,831
specific way by the archeological
discoveries that we find at the sites the

30
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,240
earliest places where these
colonies came into being.

31
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:45,270
So it's that combination archaeology
plus Greek tradition that lies behind the

32
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:46,324
date of any city.

33
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,760
But you shouldn't take the date that I
give you the traditional date as being

34
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,343
firm.

35
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:58,170
It's a general thing it's around that
time is the best we can really say to

36
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,960
date.

37
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,960
That's sort of typical for the general
phenomenon of colonisation coming out of

38
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:09,430
the mother cities of Greece is again that
date we keep talking about 750 roughly.

39
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,240
But in fact the earliest date according
to Greek tradition if my memory is

40
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,620
correct was something like seven
seventy three where the Greeks date the

41
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:28,300
foundation of what they thought was the
earliest colony they ever established

42
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,630
place that they called Perfect Koussa
which we call it's the island of SGA in

43
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:36,430
the Bay of Naples.

44
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,170
That's the very first place where there
is a tradition of a Greek colony having

45
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:42,004
been planted.

46
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,230
There's no question that there was a
Greek colony there and and as I say the

47
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:51,990
archaeological remains confirm the
general time for this happening.

48
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:59,070
Now the first question I suppose is but
before I get to describing what a colony

49
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:01,440
was and how it worked.

50
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,940
We want to ask the question What was it
that led Greeks to sail or walk most of

51
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:16,471
this sail very great distances from
their mother cities to leave home and to

52
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:23,400
establish a new city for
themselves someplace else.

53
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,760
That is not to be taken for granted in
the first place by until the twentieth

54
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,160
century I guess human
beings tended to stay put.

55
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,510
They didn't move unless
they were driven to move.

56
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,850
That was the natural thing to do given
the character of life which was based

57
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:44,684
upon farming.

58
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,690
If you leave you lose your farm based
upon the difficulty of transportation in

59
00:04:50,511 --> 00:04:54,380
the Greek world we know I think I quoted
something from he that confirm it.

60
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,300
The Greeks were even though they went
to see plenty they were terrified of the

61
00:04:59,301 --> 00:05:03,920
sea for a very good reason their ships
their boats were not very seaworthy.

62
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,550
Storms come up in the Mediterranean
very suddenly and terribly.

63
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,250
You take your life in your
hands when you travel.

64
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,630
So then there is the whole idea you know
we've already given you some sense that

65
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:16,640
the Greeks were ancestor worshippers.

66
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:21,670
I mean they took special care of the
dead and they thought that the way you

67
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:24,260
buried people and so on
was terribly important.

68
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,120
And so what I'm saying is when you leave
the place where you were born you will

69
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,520
leave your ancestors as well.

70
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:36,910
All of that means we need to explain why
these folks do what they end up doing

71
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:43,630
and we have some hints but of course we
do not know with any certainty or any

72
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:45,734
confidence.

73
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,610
If you ask the question why did many
Italians leave their home especially south

74
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:58,871
Italians in the late 19th century and
come well go all over the world actually

75
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,340
South America Australia. But the
largest numbers to the United States.

76
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,250
Why did they do that. Well we
don't have to do a lot of guessing.

77
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:12,850
We have written evidence from the people
who went and they say why they did it.

78
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,100
We can then supplement that with all sorts
of other information that we have but

79
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:23,360
we don't have any documents from some
settler explaining why he's going where

80
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:24,194
he's going.

81
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,980
So we have to reason from the evidence
that the establishment gives us.

82
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,820
I suppose the most widely cited reason
is simply the desire to acquire farmland

83
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,563
remember.

84
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:48,020
I keep emphasizing this the
vast overwhelming majority
of people needed to farm

85
00:06:49,711 --> 00:06:52,410
land in order to stay alive.

86
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,630
And why should there be
a shortage of farm land.

87
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,050
One answer and that's the one that is
most widely believed among Greek scholars

88
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,520
is that the growth of population that
we have mentioned in connection with the

89
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:10,290
rise of the poles is still working.

90
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,970
Once the Poles comes
into form and so what.

91
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,610
What this means if you are producing.

92
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,560
If you have used to had two
children and now you have four.

93
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,470
How do you provide for the extra two.

94
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,630
Well you know some.

95
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,410
Sometimes you divide up the land equally
but if that land continues to get

96
00:07:31,411 --> 00:07:35,200
smaller and smaller it will not
sustain an additional person.

97
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,840
Not to mention additional family.

98
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:42,600
If you were to follow the procedure
which the Greeks did not of primogeniture

99
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,140
that is of giving the whole
plot to the eldest son.

100
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,850
But what happens to the others.

101
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,210
And so that clearly is a problem.

102
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,320
And the notion that land hunger is a key
explanation I think is supported by the

103
00:07:58,501 --> 00:08:03,501
fact that wherever we find a pulse
whatever other characteristics it has and

104
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:09,741
they vary some of them are located at
wonderful places on the sea for trading

105
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:17,451
purposes some of them are not but all
of them have a land supply which permits

106
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:25,491
the citizens to farm successfully and
thereby to keep the make the polis

107
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,343
succeed.

108
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,780
But I don't think that's the only answer.

109
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:38,770
I think that desire for commerce
would have been also I agree with the

110
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:44,840
traditional view which is that this
would've been a lesser consideration but

111
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:47,540
still very important
because we so often find.

112
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:53,140
That the colony is placed right out of
a nifty place for trade and they would

113
00:08:56,061 --> 00:09:01,061
have had to be damn fools to have
several there without that being in their

114
00:09:01,071 --> 00:09:01,470
mind.

115
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:06,470
So although some of the places where
they settled leave us puzzled and it left

116
00:09:06,801 --> 00:09:07,850
the ancients puzzled.

117
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,880
One of my favorite example is the colony
on the south shore of the Bosporus

118
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,790
which is called Chelsea then Calcutta
on whichever way you want to do it.

119
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,150
It's right opposite Constantinople
and no constant. That doesn't exist.

120
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:30,830
Istanbul Winston Churchill never
never conceded that it was Istanbul.

121
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,050
He called it Constantinople
to the day he died.

122
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:39,670
But right opposite that magnificent
sight the Golden Horn is there.

123
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:46,220
How could you possibly settle
there because they settled
Chelsea then first and

124
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:50,810
the tradition that the Greeks pass on
is the people who settle Chelsea on war

125
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,760
blind men because you would have
to be blind to make that choice.

126
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,340
But we don't know why
they did what they did.

127
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,640
So but nonetheless the desire for a good
commercial opportunity might well have

128
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:10,930
been one of the elements that these
people who were leaving their home cities

129
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,720
sought. And then there are less.

130
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,050
What's the word I want.

131
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,550
Certainly things that have nothing
to do with economics really.

132
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,700
We always there are always there were
politics going on in these states as there

133
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:27,480
always are.

134
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,160
In any Greek polls there are factions
that grow up for one reason or another.

135
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,690
They come into conflict.

136
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:39,020
One side wins the argument and the battle
and sometimes the ill will is so great

137
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,800
that the losing fought side feels either
that it has to flee for its safety or

138
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:49,320
that it chooses to flee rather
than to live under their opponents.

139
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,850
And so you would have.

140
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Defeated political groups might well or
individuals who were the heads of those

141
00:10:57,361 --> 00:11:01,320
groups might decide they have to get
out of town and now that we do have

142
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:06,300
something this wave of colonization
they join that as well.

143
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,930
And then there are always things that
we might call much less rational than

144
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:12,894
that.

145
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,340
In any group of people.

146
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:19,460
There is a small minority
I want to emphasize small
who'd just love to do risky

147
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,990
things they just love adventure.

148
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,660
They're never happy if they're safe.

149
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:32,530
And so off to go seeking adventure and
seeking to make a fortune however they're

150
00:11:33,531 --> 00:11:37,590
going to do it. So I think that has
to be counted into the picture too.

151
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,110
So typically I think it would have
been a small part of what's going on.

152
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,960
So for these reasons and probably for a
hundred more that I haven't thought of.

153
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:53,650
We can understand why these people go
against the natural instinct of staying

154
00:11:53,901 --> 00:11:58,901
put and go of adventuring out seeking a
new home someplace in the Mediterranean.

155
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,330
OK.

156
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,630
What are these new settlements like.

157
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,940
First thing is that they're like each
other in many important ways although

158
00:12:10,941 --> 00:12:13,190
obviously with differences
from place to place.

159
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,570
But here's how it works by the way.

160
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,720
The word I have been using colony is not
a Greek word and really not appropriate

161
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,070
for what the Greeks are up to.

162
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:29,090
The Greek word for this is up or a key
out and most literally it would mean a

163
00:12:31,271 --> 00:12:34,390
home away and away home.

164
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,590
And that's what they're making they're
re-establishing themselves a household a

165
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,590
home someplace away
from where they started.

166
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,860
And that's the name colony is a Latin
word ultimately for colonia and the Roman

167
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:53,671
colonies were first of all garrisons
that they planted in land they had

168
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:56,800
conquered to keep the people quiet.

169
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:02,580
So they would be alien bosses
in a different territory.

170
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,740
And then later in history in Roman
history that was the name given to

171
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,250
establishment rural establishments.

172
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,280
When the civilization was breaking down
and they had and the men who worked on

173
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:24,181
those rural places really were not free
men and were the antecedents of the

174
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:28,234
service.

175
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,560
We will see later on in
medieval history in Europe.

176
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:38,200
So when you see the word colonia in
late Roman history it's talking about

177
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:41,830
something very very different
from what we're talking about. So.

178
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:47,440
I use the word count because that's what
we have for all such establishments of

179
00:13:47,441 --> 00:13:52,441
the kind we're talking about
but I remember that these
are appoint key from the

180
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:55,650
Greek point of view.
OK.

181
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,250
How does an upward Keya happen

182
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,140
somebody in one of the old Greek cities
has to decide that he wants to go out

183
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,730
and establish a colony.

184
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,600
He would be an individual of some
eminence because the job of doing this

185
00:14:18,061 --> 00:14:22,710
requires that people should accept.
His leadership.

186
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:28,440
He will have to do the recruiting of
people that come with him on the colony.

187
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:34,190
He will have to do the constitutional
discussion and political discussion to

188
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:39,321
gain the sanction from the mother city
to allow him to do everything he knows.

189
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:44,910
So I think we should imagine that these
colonies these leaders of colonies these

190
00:14:44,911 --> 00:14:48,900
founders of colonies
would be probably noblemen

191
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,710
and that they would have a
position of eminence but and yet.

192
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,640
Unlikely to be part of the sort of
dominant faction in that city because

193
00:15:02,371 --> 00:15:05,320
otherwise why would they leave anyway.

194
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:10,170
The Greeks had a name for this individual.
He was called an OI c'est states.

195
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,040
He is the founder of the colony so now
he has decided to do it and he's gained

196
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:21,810
recognition from the town council
let's say. And he can go forward.

197
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,230
Now he has to have an idea.
He did.

198
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:31,280
He can't just say I think I'd like to
found a colony but is more typical I think

199
00:15:31,601 --> 00:15:36,601
is that he thinks I would like to take
and I've found a colony on the south

200
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,970
eastern coast of Sicily Y.

201
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,790
Because he knows something about it.

202
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:51,400
Either he has somehow traveled out
there himself and said take the place.

203
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,850
I'm thinking about.
Has a wonderful harbor.

204
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,390
It has good farmland in the neighborhood.

205
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:04,320
A critical element to making this
judgment is it is not occupied by hostile

206
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:08,920
natives who will resist vigorously.

207
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:13,480
Your landing there either there will be
nobody there or more likely there will

208
00:16:13,481 --> 00:16:16,360
be not a very big population
and it's not very tough.

209
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:21,280
And they could be easily brushed aside
those would have been some of the

210
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:22,220
considerations.

211
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:27,630
And so what the orchestra is does when
he has picked out in his own mind where

212
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:32,701
he wants to go next he
goes to Delphi anybody.

213
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:38,160
You raise your hand if you've been to
Delphi Yeah well it's when you go to

214
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:42,600
Greece do the obvious go
where the tourists go.

215
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,800
And Delphi is one place not to miss
it's halfway up Mount Parnassus.

216
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,000
And it was thought by the
Greeks to be the on fellows.

217
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,100
The navel of the universe
the center in every way.

218
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,143
Why.

219
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,240
Because they're the God Apollo
had established a an oracle.

220
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,030
There were there was a place

221
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,980
in which from the earth there came
a star wasn't steam what it was.

222
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,200
What would it be gases would
escape through this gap in
the earth and there when

223
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:22,110
things got figured out and arranged and
there were priests who worshiped Apollo

224
00:17:22,111 --> 00:17:24,430
there and who took care
of this phenomenon.

225
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:29,280
There was if they would place a
young woman there who would sit.

226
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,910
As these gases came up.
And she would.

227
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:38,930
After a while begin to I suppose in the
biblical languages she would speak in

228
00:17:40,621 --> 00:17:45,360
tongues which is to say she would rattle
off a lot of language which nobody

229
00:17:45,361 --> 00:17:50,361
could understand what she was saying
gibberish or so it sounded or Greek making

230
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:53,460
no sense to anybody.

231
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:58,910
And then the priest would listen to this
stuff and he would say Ah what Apollo

232
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:05,100
said through the priest is here is.
And he would give the message

233
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:10,740
let me just take a moment to tell you
about this I say this now with great

234
00:18:10,741 --> 00:18:11,400
confidence.

235
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,400
But ten years ago this story which all
the Greeks agreed to have agreed upon in

236
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:22,380
every respect the temple of Apollo was
built right on top of this underneath the

237
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:27,380
floor of the temple was this little room
where the gases came up with a priest

238
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:28,980
who sat through all of this came up.

239
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,280
Well archaeologists investigated this
carefully the French school of archaeology

240
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,210
late in the 19th century dug everything
up and concluded this was baloney.

241
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,230
It was a myth.

242
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:44,160
There were no gases coming up
from any of this stuff. And.

243
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:50,180
So everybody believed for the next century
and then a young man who once sat in

244
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,970
one of the chairs not in this room
maybe but that in which you're sitting.

245
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,850
John Hale of the Yale class of
nineteen seventy three who is now an

246
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,830
archaeologist at the
University of Louisville

247
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:11,860
having learned or having agreed let's
say with my prejudice which is that the

248
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:14,810
higher now used Hey must reign.

249
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,370
And if the Greeks said it happened you
got to believe it happened until you have

250
00:19:19,371 --> 00:19:20,660
to believe that it didn't happen.

251
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:26,590
And so we decided to investigate this and
he took with him a fine geologist from

252
00:19:28,011 --> 00:19:33,011
Wesleyan and justice to go to the place
there at Delphi and to see whether it

253
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:38,640
could be true that such
gases did come out.

254
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,190
And what sort of gases they were and
what consequences they would have.

255
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,080
And you know I wouldn't be telling you
this story if it hadn't turned out that

256
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,560
they discovered evidence
that in my judgment.

257
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,020
But I don't think really
anybody doubts it anymore.

258
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,720
Totally confirmed the Greek story. I can
tell you precisely what the gases were.

259
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:05,410
What the characteristics of those gases
were squared beautifully with all the

260
00:20:06,411 --> 00:20:11,411
tales that we heard
about the Delphic oracle.

261
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,650
So here's just one more case where Yale
helped to straighten out the world.

262
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,080
But you notice it wasn't done by Yale
faculty member we we engage in confusing

263
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:27,770
the world but our alumni do a much
better job and that's what happened here.

264
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:34,480
So. So you go to the Oracle and what
do you say. What do you ask the oracle.

265
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:39,130
Well now before we go any further you
will in your Herodotus readings and

266
00:20:39,131 --> 00:20:44,131
elsewhere you will come across many a
story in which an Oracle is consulted and

267
00:20:44,441 --> 00:20:45,370
gives an answer.

268
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:50,670
Well the most famous early on King Croesus
of Lydia the richest man in the world

269
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:55,900
you've heard all about him decides it
would be a nice thing to conquer the

270
00:20:55,901 --> 00:21:00,850
Persian empire his neighbor to the east
and so he goes to the east a barbarian

271
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,150
but the barbarians came to the Delphic
Oracle to because you want to know what

272
00:21:04,151 --> 00:21:06,910
the gods want.
So he came and he asked.

273
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:12,150
He said if I if I cross the Halley's River
that's the boundary between Libya and

274
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,700
Persia what will happen

275
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:21,190
and the Oracle replied.
A great empire will be destroyed.

276
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,120
And presses it. Terrific.
That's what I have in mind.

277
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,280
He invaded he was clobbered.

278
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,810
And then you read a splendid story
about it just tells of how here he was

279
00:21:33,811 --> 00:21:35,460
captured.
He was up on a pyre.

280
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,560
He was going to be burned
when he remembered so long.

281
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,760
The Greek would come to him and
warned him about this vain glory.

282
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,750
And he said oh so long and oh so long
and I guess Apollo must have then said Ah

283
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,610
he's read.

284
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:54,930
He's reached wisdom and so he sent a
rainstorm to put the fire out and he lived

285
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,040
through that.
Well OK.

286
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:01,740
But the point is the Oracle was wrong.
No of course not.

287
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,000
We all know what was wrong with creases.

288
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,610
He should have asked another question
which empire but didn't think of it.

289
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:14,890
Other times you know all kinds of funny
stories told about the Oracle which

290
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:19,190
would suggest that it wasn't really a
very reliable source of information that

291
00:22:19,191 --> 00:22:21,860
it was filled with knowledge
mythology and so on and so forth.

292
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:27,130
But here it is the hard headed fact we
know for sure Greeks and barbarians and

293
00:22:27,351 --> 00:22:31,880
everybody came to Delphi when you came
to Delphi and you were going to consult

294
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:35,160
the oracle. It was hard. A
lot of people a long line.

295
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:40,210
So there was a waiting issue but also
people used to bribe the priest in order

296
00:22:41,031 --> 00:22:46,031
to get up more more upfront online and
they would also give great and beautiful

297
00:22:46,761 --> 00:22:51,390
gifts to the temple people and
to the temple and to the priest.

298
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:57,080
And in other words people spent a
lot of money to consult the oracle.

299
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:00,440
Now ask yourself this especially you're
talking about Greeks are they going to

300
00:23:00,441 --> 00:23:04,310
keep shelling out money for an oracle
that gives them answers that turn out to

301
00:23:04,311 --> 00:23:05,144
be wrong.

302
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,733
No.

303
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,920
Most of the things they asked
were questions that really
had a yes or no answer.

304
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:17,690
And according according to my thinking
there's no way they could have been wrong

305
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:18,763
very much.

306
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:23,980
And I think the Oracle probably gained
its fame for being very good at precisely

307
00:23:26,721 --> 00:23:27,950
at answering this question.

308
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:33,250
The question would have been what will
happen if I go and try to settle a colony

309
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,440
at the place which I will call Syracuse.

310
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,520
That's what I've been describing on
the southeastern coast of Sicily.

311
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,800
And the answer would come back and the
priests would give a response that would

312
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:47,270
be essentially straight.

313
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:51,570
It would either say something like I'm
not going to do the words that they would

314
00:23:51,571 --> 00:23:55,020
have come up with but they would have
said yep that's a good place to go.

315
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,990
And if or no don't do that.
That's a terrible mistake.

316
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,970
Now why would they be able to do that.
Because at some point in here

317
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,010
Delphi really did become the navel
of the universe. Everybody came.

318
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:14,240
Now you can bet when these folks came
and consulted the priest and said Could

319
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:16,640
you please put us down on the list
we want to consult the oracle.

320
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:20,540
The priest said sure have a beer.
Let's talk about your hometown.

321
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,800
What's going on out there.

322
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,750
What I'm suggesting to you that this
was the best information gathering and

323
00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:30,530
storing device that existed
in the Mediterranean world.

324
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,330
These people knew more than
anybody else about these things.

325
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:40,550
And so consulting that Oracle
was a very rational act indeed.

326
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,470
OK.

327
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:46,850
Now suppose you are annoyed orchestrates
you've gotten the permission from your

328
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:48,000
city to go forward.

329
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,250
You go to the Delphic Oracle
and the other car says fine.

330
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,590
By all means go where you want to go.

331
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,650
Next thing you've got to go home and
you have to write up what amounts to a

332
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:05,710
charter of foundation for the city which
lays out how things are going to work

333
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,230
in this city.

334
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:14,870
Something about the governmental structure
maybe even more fundamentally how the

335
00:25:14,871 --> 00:25:19,871
land will be a lot of assigned divided
and so on so that when you go to recruit

336
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,190
settlers everybody will know what he's
getting and we'll decide whether it's

337
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,640
it's a good idea for him or not.

338
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:34,570
Now recruiting is tremendously
important because you need to have.

339
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:41,890
A certain number of settlers
to make the settlement viable.

340
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,720
You may not run into.

341
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,080
An enormously powerful collection of
natives but you're gonna get some kind of

342
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:51,530
trouble.

343
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:55,880
It's foolish for you to assume you're not
going to have any problem out there so

344
00:25:55,881 --> 00:25:58,730
you need a certain number of
people just for defense purposes.

345
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:03,140
But beyond that you need to have a certain
number of people to carry out all the

346
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:06,090
functions that need to be carried
out for a successful post.

347
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:11,780
So however many that is that is what
you try to recruit and you recruit

348
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,240
typically it would be at a time when it's
easy to get people together so you can

349
00:26:19,251 --> 00:26:23,750
tell them the story. And the best
time would be at some great festival.

350
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:28,340
There are festivals held in each
city just for its own citizens.

351
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,800
And my guess is that when you could do
that when you felt that you could recruit

352
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,850
a full colony from your fellow
citizens in Corinth let us say.

353
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,673
That's what you did.

354
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:45,370
But it would often happen that there were
not enough Corinthians who were ready

355
00:26:45,441 --> 00:26:50,441
to go with you on your expedition so you
would try to have to take your message

356
00:26:51,141 --> 00:26:56,141
to one of the pan hellenic festivals
which were getting organized about this

357
00:26:56,901 --> 00:27:01,640
time as you know the Olympic Games
are alleged to have started in 1776.

358
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:06,440
So that would be a place where Greeks
from all over might come and you could

359
00:27:06,441 --> 00:27:10,620
then try to recruit settlers
for your new colony there.

360
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,980
And we don't know precisely when but
there were important pan hellenic games at

361
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:21,380
near Corinth the isthmus in games that
were pan hellenic games at Delphi and

362
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:26,160
there were a pan hellenic games in the
north eastern Peloponnese at a town

363
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:27,600
called Noumea.
So.

364
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:33,860
There would always be some opportunity
for you to go out and make your pitch so

365
00:27:34,001 --> 00:27:39,001
now you have everything in place you've
recruited your settlements you get on

366
00:27:40,391 --> 00:27:42,400
your ships and sail.

367
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,520
In this case out to the western West
Central Mediterranean you find your way to

368
00:27:50,051 --> 00:27:53,020
Sicily work your way into
the harbor at Syracuse.

369
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,090
And things work out.

370
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:00,690
And now we have this boy Keya called
Syracuse so the next question I think is

371
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,960
what is the relationship between Syracuse
which is the outpost here and the end

372
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:20,470
currents which is the main topless
the metropolis the mother city.

373
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,910
That's what metropolis means by the way.

374
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:32,100
First thing to brush from your mind along
with the word colony as we have used

375
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:36,760
it in modern times is the notion that.

376
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:42,180
The city of Syracuse would send out
a colony controlled owns the city of

377
00:28:44,591 --> 00:28:49,340
Syracuse which it has sent out.
This is not the case.

378
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:54,570
But before they get the British gave
Hong Kong back Hong Kong was a Crown

379
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:59,290
Colony. It was British territory.
The Brit was ruled by Britain.

380
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:01,863
And so on.

381
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:07,710
No this is not what an eye here is from
the first Syracuse is an independent

382
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:15,300
policy autonomous self-governing
whatever regime it wants et cetera.

383
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,960
It is not a subject of anybody
not Corinth or anybody else.

384
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,470
But that's not the end of the story.
The question really is.

385
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:29,860
So now we know that what kind
of relations did they have.

386
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:35,580
I would say there are three categories
that they fall into the most typical the

387
00:29:37,891 --> 00:29:40,740
usual.
Everything else is an exception.

388
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:47,930
Is that there are friendly relations
between the mother city and the upper IKEA

389
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:55,770
but they are just keep in mind always.
They are totally independent.

390
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,840
An example is the Peloponnesian War.

391
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:05,590
Syracuse finds itself besieged by the
Athenians they send to Corinth asking the

392
00:30:09,451 --> 00:30:11,580
Corinthians please help us.

393
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,910
The Corinthians are free.

394
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:20,010
They will be violating
no law or sacred bond.

395
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,270
If they say Sorry we really
don't feel like doing that.

396
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,750
It would be thought they
were not behaving very well.

397
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,480
But they would have been
as I say perfectly within
every right you can imagine

398
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,613
to do that.

399
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:40,550
But the typical reaction would be that
the Corinthians would help to the extent

400
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,880
first of all that they could.

401
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:48,480
And secondly to the extent that it
was consistent with their interests.

402
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:53,930
Well in fact the Corinthians self sent
very little said a couple of ships and a

403
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,800
general which turned out to
be tremendously important
but they couldn't have

404
00:30:58,801 --> 00:31:03,801
known that in advance from where we
said it looks like the Corinthians were

405
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:08,620
making a gesture of
friendship of solidarity.

406
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
The kind of thing you would expect a
mother city to do not to ignore its apathy

407
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,080
care when it was in trouble.

408
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:21,950
And so that's that's all that they did
and that it is a fairly first of all it

409
00:31:22,051 --> 00:31:26,580
was normal. For the opera. Care to
turn to the mother city for help.

410
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,500
It was normal for the mother city to be
inclined to help if they could do it.

411
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:33,690
That's normal.

412
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,020
I think you if you imagine out of the
many many many colonies there were that

413
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:39,180
would have been the usual arrangement.

414
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:44,300
Now there are exceptions
in both directions and as
it happens the cases I know

415
00:31:44,881 --> 00:31:49,860
best have to do with the city of Carmen's
current sent out a lot of colonies.

416
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:55,550
Which is why we know something about their
arrangements and the ones I'm talking

417
00:31:56,101 --> 00:31:59,610
about all have to do with
the Peloponnesian War which
is one of the few reasons

418
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:04,020
one of the reasons why we know a little
bit about it because facilities tells us

419
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,220
the details of it.

420
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:11,060
Well we know thanks to facilities
that it had become normal for.

421
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,640
Currents to send out to its colony part
of DIA located on the Charles Citic

422
00:32:19,851 --> 00:32:24,770
Peninsula you know those three fingers
sticking down into the Aegean Sea from

423
00:32:24,771 --> 00:32:26,390
the mainland of Greece.

424
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,550
One of this is a town
on one of those fingers.

425
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:36,400
The part of the eye every year received
magistrates who govern their city from

426
00:32:38,811 --> 00:32:43,460
currents. And this was not
imposed. This was not by force.

427
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,720
This was by mutual agreement.

428
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:51,620
So currents really had a very great deal
to say about what was going on and part

429
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:55,130
of the US so when part of the deal got
into trouble with Athens and found itself

430
00:32:55,131 --> 00:33:00,110
besieged currents sent a real
army to go in there and fight.

431
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:05,590
And I think that's because of this very
special relationship that they had at

432
00:33:05,661 --> 00:33:07,970
the other end of the spectrum.
It's again currents.

433
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:13,060
It has a colony up in the
Northwest called Coursera.

434
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:18,890
It is the modern island of Corfu
and this

435
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,480
colony was clearly established earlier
than 664 because that's the first time we

436
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:30,770
hear of it's taking any action it's been
around for a while. Very early colony

437
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:37,270
and from the earliest times Coursera does
not get along with the mother city of

438
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:39,503
Khan.

439
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:44,950
The first relationship between them is
a naval battle and thereafter we hear of

440
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:51,641
them quarrelling and fighting with each
other just about at least once a century

441
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:56,330
right on down till we get
to the Peloponnesian War.

442
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:01,540
When a quarrel over who's who's won
out in that area between coronation and

443
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:07,301
Coursera is the I would say well it's the
first instigating element and bringing

444
00:34:09,531 --> 00:34:10,790
on the Peloponnesian War.

445
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,960
OK so this gives you some idea of the
range of possible relationships between

446
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,010
colony and Mother City.

447
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Just I want to emphasize one more time
that the overwhelming normal situation is

448
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:29,350
the first one I describe.
Friendly. Why not.

449
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:35,110
These guys that have gone out let us
say to Syracuse they are your people.

450
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:39,230
They have relatives back home.
They have friends back home.

451
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:40,850
It is natural.

452
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:45,970
Oh by the way they're accustomed to
worship the gods in the same way that the

453
00:34:46,611 --> 00:34:47,720
Corinthians do.

454
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:53,410
We do know again two cities is our source
that it was customary for colonies to

455
00:34:53,631 --> 00:34:58,631
send representatives back to the mother
city for the religious observations that

456
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:04,040
were common to them all.
So that doesn't create good feelings.

457
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:09,130
They feel like they're relatives and what
could be more natural you're out there

458
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:14,590
in Sicily and you discover of course
that you don't have all of the the things

459
00:35:17,301 --> 00:35:20,750
that you used to have available
to you but used to be made.

460
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:25,880
Let us say in Corinth as a matter of fact
in the early days Corinth was a great

461
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:30,881
center of painted pottery and was the
leading producer and exporter of that.

462
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,870
So maybe you wanted a really fine part
of the kind of used to be able to walk to

463
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:37,700
the corner and pick up at a pottery.

464
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,230
But you can't get now so you would
want to buy what the currency and sell.

465
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,540
Guess what. You've got great
greenfields out there in Syracuse.

466
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:52,460
Hard to believe today but Sicily was
one of the major granaries of the

467
00:35:52,461 --> 00:35:54,230
Mediterranean world at that time.

468
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:59,260
Tremendously fruitful able to grow the
best possible crops very good wheat and

469
00:35:59,421 --> 00:36:01,910
so on.
Khan's always needs that kind of stuff.

470
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:07,210
So we sell you are wheat you sell us your
pottery you sell us good wine that we

471
00:36:08,421 --> 00:36:12,620
can't grow yet and maybe never we'll
be able to grow in our neighborhood.

472
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:13,850
So on and so forth.

473
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:19,210
So you can see why it would
be very natural for all
sorts of ties to unite these

474
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,790
colony and Mother City.

475
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,570
Maybe I would just give you a chance.

476
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,260
Before I turn the next question to ask
any questions that still are not clear

477
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:38,470
for you about this phenomenon
of colonization. Everybody OK.

478
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,163
Yes.

479
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,140
Question is who used it.

480
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,510
Who gave permission for a
colony to go in the Mother City.

481
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:54,200
The best guess and that's the only
thing I think we have would be.

482
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:57,500
These would have been
aristocratic republics.

483
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:02,740
At this stage of the game and so there
would have been a Council of Nobles that

484
00:37:03,111 --> 00:37:05,360
would typically have done it.

485
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:10,580
As you move later in their history you
find you can guess that there would be

486
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:15,820
councils that were not purely of nobles
but might be of wealthy people but they

487
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:19,880
would always be a minority
and come from the upper class.

488
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:25,380
I think that would be where they would
get their legitimacy in the back. Yeah.

489
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,850
A primitive form of what.

490
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,730
I did.
I'm not sure that that concept makes it.

491
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,780
No the answer is no because nobody
was compelled to do anything.

492
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:45,330
You know the British practicing
mercantilism were passed
navigation acts saying

493
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:50,130
what ships could carry water and so on.
Nothing like that in the Greek world.

494
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:54,200
Everybody. All of this is voluntary
on both sides of every agreed.

495
00:37:55,420 --> 00:38:00,060
OK now where are these colonies.

496
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,360
Let me give you a little
rundown before we get to that.

497
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:10,990
I should say that the Greeks have already
before this period of the polis and

498
00:38:13,131 --> 00:38:16,070
the period of colonization which is
connected with the rise of the poles

499
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:21,820
centuries before that the Greeks had
already spread out from their original

500
00:38:21,981 --> 00:38:22,814
settlements.

501
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:28,700
Right after the collapse of the
masonry and world there was a period of

502
00:38:28,701 --> 00:38:33,701
tremendous confusion and panic and fear
and so on so that we know that people

503
00:38:35,451 --> 00:38:40,451
fleeing from whoever destroyed
the masonry and world.

504
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:46,360
Fled typically eastward into the island
among the islands of the Aegean Sea and

505
00:38:48,861 --> 00:38:53,861
continuing on to the coast of Asia Minor
beyond them and so that by the 10th

506
00:38:55,701 --> 00:39:00,701
century B.C. We see Greek cities lining
the coast of Asia Minor on the West and

507
00:39:03,861 --> 00:39:05,090
even around on the bottom.

508
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:09,170
And to some degree on the north
and on the islands in the Aegean.

509
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:14,890
So there has been a Greek what's the word
I want an expansion of the Greek world

510
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,830
already.
By the 10th century.

511
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:23,890
And these folks are now settled down so
that some of these cities are in fact

512
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:29,240
among the most important cities
sending out colonies of their own.

513
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:34,840
Of these the most famous perhaps most
important was my leaders and Ionian city

514
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:41,950
located on the west coast of Asia Minor
which sent many a colony into different

515
00:39:42,081 --> 00:39:47,081
parts of the world particularly up towards
the Straits and the Bosphorus and the

516
00:39:48,531 --> 00:39:49,364
Sea of Marmara.

517
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:56,770
I might point out that the way the Greeks
did their emigration into Asia Minor.

518
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:02,840
They actually had a pattern so that you
can go from north to south and you will

519
00:40:04,011 --> 00:40:06,410
find some consistency.
Here's what I mean.

520
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:11,950
The the northern most settlements on
that coast spoke Greek within Aeolian

521
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,153
dialect.

522
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,160
The I only I wrote the Ionian dialect is
the one that you see on the mainland in

523
00:40:22,101 --> 00:40:25,700
places like Bosnia for
instance Thebes and so on.

524
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:32,390
South of the Ionian or Aeolian section
of that was the region of Asia Minor

525
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,860
inhabited chiefly by Iona ends.

526
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:42,860
The people on the mainland who are
the main Ionian obvious meanings.

527
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,610
And finally if you go to the most southern
part of the west coast of Asia Minor

528
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,920
you come to the Dorian speaking Greeks
and the whole pull up any source as you

529
00:40:52,921 --> 00:40:56,850
know was fundamentally
a Dorian speaking place.

530
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:02,420
So that's the way the world looks
when the policies invented and when

531
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:06,810
colonization begins to become a big thing.

532
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,480
Now let's take a look at the world of
the Mediterranean and see how the Greek

533
00:41:12,481 --> 00:41:17,070
expansion worked.
Let's start with the Aegean Sea.

534
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:23,270
Just almost all the islands in that sea
are inhabited by Greeks mostly by the

535
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:32,210
Greeks that came in that first wave of
emigrants earlier on not colonized during

536
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:38,330
the 8th century and afterwards but if
you go to the north shore of the Aegean

537
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:43,320
Sea into the region that the
Greeks called thrice. Sorry.

538
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:48,210
Before I even get to race maybe even a
little bit of Cecilie which is off mostly

539
00:41:48,211 --> 00:41:51,570
to the west of the Aegean Sea.

540
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:56,870
A little bit but not thrice chiefly
which is the the northern shore of the

541
00:41:57,091 --> 00:42:01,770
Aegean Sea. Lots of Greek colonies
there. It's fundamentally part of Greece.

542
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:02,400
Yeah.

543
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,990
This is not a bad time for me to remind
you that in one of Plato's dialogues

544
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:12,170
dialogues Socrates says
the Greeks sit like.

545
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:16,170
Frogs around a pond.

546
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,040
And that pond is the Aegean Sea.

547
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,680
It's a helpful little story to remember
because we tend to think of Greece

548
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,780
because of its modern geography.

549
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,110
As that peninsula of which there is
a sub Peninsula at the bottom is the

550
00:42:31,111 --> 00:42:34,460
Peloponnesian.
That was not the Greece of antiquity.

551
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:39,710
If you had to pick a central focus of
where the Greeks were it would be in the

552
00:42:39,711 --> 00:42:42,680
Aegean Sea.
So that's useful to remember.

553
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:47,030
Then as you move east
along that coast you go.

554
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:51,590
You come to the Gallipoli Peninsula all
of which is now Turkey and for the rest

555
00:42:51,591 --> 00:42:52,890
of what I'm going to
be saying for a while.

556
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:57,800
It'll be Turkey as well but through
the straits the Dardanelles the sea of

557
00:42:57,801 --> 00:42:58,634
Marmara.

558
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:03,500
Bosphorus Greek cities
all over on both sides.

559
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:06,770
If you keep going east
you hit the Black Sea.

560
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:11,810
If you move northwards along the
Black Sea and southwards as well.

561
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:17,470
Greek cities not in the same number they
are fewer than they are in the places

562
00:43:18,951 --> 00:43:23,750
I've mentioned so far but important ones.
For instance when you get up to Crimea

563
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:29,390
the chief city we call
is such as Sebastopol.

564
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,900
That comes from Greek words means
separate us Polis the sacred city so named

565
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:44,410
after Augustus by Greeks who lived there
after the Emperor Augustus had achieved

566
00:43:45,261 --> 00:43:48,380
power.
But it was always inhabited by Greeks.

567
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:52,460
Similarly Odessa the
chief city of Ukraine.

568
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:58,540
Apart from Kiev was a Greek city and
likewise on the northern shore of Turkey

569
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:04,580
there are Greek cities to be
found one that leaps to mind is I.

570
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,580
How do they pronounce it in Turkish.
Trabzon.

571
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:13,970
But it was a trap as this was a
trap. No. What was it called in Greek

572
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,050
trip to the peasants wasn't it.

573
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:19,640
Yeah. Anyway. So.

574
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:25,630
It's not the Black Sea is not a Greek
lake but there are Greek cities that are

575
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:29,220
spotted along the coast
now not on the East Coast.

576
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,930
When you get to the Caucasus
you are in Barbarian territory.

577
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:38,500
So when the when the mythical mission
of Jason and the his his Argonauts goes

578
00:44:41,981 --> 00:44:46,981
sailing out to that territory he is
out there and you know what was it the

579
00:44:47,031 --> 00:44:50,150
Tarzan country or as far as
the Greeks were concerned.

580
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:53,750
It's just the wilds of
out in that territory.

581
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:59,140
Remember he marries and brings home a
wife Madea and she of course is like no

582
00:45:01,761 --> 00:45:06,700
Greek woman who ever lived. She
is a witch. She can perform magic

583
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:11,880
and she can do monstrous things that
you can't imagine a Greek woman doing.

584
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:16,970
At least the Greeks can't imagine so
that's not Greek territory out there.

585
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:22,100
Well let's let's get back out into the
agency and we just cross to Asia Minor.

586
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:27,450
Now if you turn the bend at the southern
end of Asia Minor and begin moving east

587
00:45:27,451 --> 00:45:32,250
there are some Greek cities along in
there. But when you get to what is now.

588
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,440
Lebanon Syria the coastal places there.

589
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:43,360
Palestine those there are
no Greek cities there.

590
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,670
And that is because during the period
we're talking about those regions were

591
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:53,671
occupied by civilized powerful people
who simply would not be pushed aside and

592
00:45:55,811 --> 00:45:59,110
nobody would even dream of trying
to take them on and building

593
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:03,940
cities that would challenge
their control of that area.

594
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:09,600
So there are no Greek cities as you
keep coming down and pass Palestine you

595
00:46:11,171 --> 00:46:16,171
reach Egypt and of course Egypt is one
of the great empires of antiquity going

596
00:46:16,661 --> 00:46:21,661
back into the perhaps well certainly into
the fourth millennium prob possibly to

597
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:26,170
the fifth by no means as
powerful as it used to be.

598
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:31,630
Far from it it has been conquered.
By now by other peoples.

599
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:37,020
If you're talking about the year 750 or
something like that it's I think it's in

600
00:46:38,261 --> 00:46:40,060
the hands.
I think it's in the.

601
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:45,450
Well it is in the hands of the Assyrians
and it will ultimately fall into the

602
00:46:46,511 --> 00:46:48,220
hands of the Persians.
So.

603
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,710
That is not territory that
you can build colonies in.

604
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,960
You've got powerful empires to deal with.

605
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:59,820
There is one exception in the sixth
century I think it's around margin around

606
00:46:59,821 --> 00:47:04,821
550 or something like that the Greeks
settle a single colony in the delta of the

607
00:47:06,001 --> 00:47:10,860
Nile of Egypt at a place called Knock
crap artists and the root of that word is

608
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:11,694
ship.

609
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:16,910
It is a completely different thing from
the Apple key I've been talking about.

610
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:24,830
It is a trading post and it's there by
permission of and under the protection of

611
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,030
the king of Egypt.

612
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:32,510
And that's because he wants it's handy
for him to have a merchant settlement of

613
00:47:32,971 --> 00:47:34,950
Greeks for him to do business with.

614
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:38,100
So that's a great exception
to everything I've been saying

615
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:43,690
going west would you believe when
you get into what is now Libya.

616
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:49,150
There was a Greek a very important
Greek colony of Sai Rini and that whole

617
00:47:49,151 --> 00:47:54,151
region was called Cyrenaica and it
was a Greek and you can do that.

618
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,210
You can now you can actually go.

619
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:00,580
Now that I realize it Libya is now
open it's no longer a closed territory.

620
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,870
You'll see Greek and Roman
temperance there to prove it.

621
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:09,040
And when you go west however.

622
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,950
It stops in the coast of North Africa.

623
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:17,250
The reason being the rest of North
Africa is dominated by Carthage.

624
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:23,490
Carthage is a colony of Phoenician cities
Venetia was located where Lebanon is

625
00:48:26,051 --> 00:48:26,600
now.

626
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:31,600
It goes back to the maybe the 10th century
maybe the 9th and it was powerful and

627
00:48:32,921 --> 00:48:37,921
it tried to control not only North Africa
but the waters of the Mediterranean in

628
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:41,400
the West entirely.

629
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:47,010
The the castle Jennings in fact
have a powerful picked out terror.

630
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:54,530
In the western part of Sicily and the
Greeks will have to fight the Carthaginian

631
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:58,210
over the years for control
of the island of Sicily.

632
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,650
So that's how far east they get

633
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:06,150
and in time the Met the cousin genius
is also cross over into Spain and they

634
00:49:08,531 --> 00:49:13,531
control some portion of the
Spanish coast closest to Africa.

635
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:18,400
So there are no Greeks there.
They're shut out for the same reasons.

636
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:23,700
However once you get beyond the cost of
genuine advance into Spain there are now

637
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:29,490
Greek cities on the coast of Spain and
there continue to be Greek said he's not

638
00:49:29,561 --> 00:49:34,561
everywhere but in a spotty way into
France of which the most important and

639
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:41,041
famous is the one that the Romans
called mass cilia Marseilles.

640
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:47,970
Aye aye aye Greektown.
So is niece a Greek town.

641
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:53,060
This was a victory town and
there are several others.

642
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:57,930
So the river you they know where to go.
You know the Riviera. Places like that.

643
00:49:58,290 --> 00:49:59,830
Now what about the Italian Riviera.

644
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,970
That's pretty nifty but a Greek colony
is near Portofino where you could put in

645
00:50:03,971 --> 00:50:08,760
one. No. And the reason was
in the northern part of Italy.

646
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:13,970
There were Etruscans another powerful
ancient people who control their own area

647
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,990
and we're not about to have
anybody colonizing their territory.

648
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:24,350
However when you keep going south in
Italy past Rome the Romans were not Roman

649
00:50:29,641 --> 00:50:34,641
tradition says the city was found
in 754 three three four five 753.

650
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:39,950
So. Everybody agrees that
certainly not before that.

651
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:43,250
So in the period we're talking about
there are no Romans that you have to worry

652
00:50:43,251 --> 00:50:48,251
about but south of Rome there is a
tremendous colonizing of southern Italy.

653
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:54,110
Greek cities all over the place.

654
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,800
So Greek was that area that when the
Romans do come to dominate most of Italy

655
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:08,080
and become sort of move up against the
southern region they refer to the whole

656
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:12,530
southern portion of
that peninsula as Magna.

657
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:17,440
Great idea great Greece because
they're all Greeks down there.

658
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:23,460
And then finally down we go
to Sicily and there you have.

659
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:26,890
The East Coast.

660
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:32,400
I would say two thirds of the coast of
the island of Sicily is filled with Greek

661
00:51:32,771 --> 00:51:37,360
towns. The third to the West
is on the Carthaginian control.

662
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:41,170
The inland.
The Greeks don't move in there.

663
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:46,000
The native Sicilians inhabit
that territory and the
Greeks are not interested

664
00:51:46,001 --> 00:51:51,001
you will find very rare very rare of a
case of a Greek city which is found away

665
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,073
from the sea.

666
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:58,490
They always wanted to be close to
the sea for varieties of region.

667
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:03,570
So now I hope you have in your mind a
picture of the way the Greek world had

668
00:52:04,211 --> 00:52:08,560
expanded by the time this wave
of colonisation was complete.

669
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:12,550
Pretty complete sometime
in the 7th century B.C.

670
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:18,810
and just a word about the
leading colonizers because
I think there's something

671
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,580
to be learned from that.

672
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:24,600
One of the things you kind of speculate
about and wonder about why did some

673
00:52:24,601 --> 00:52:26,940
cities send out lots of colonies.

674
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:32,160
Some cities send out only a few and
others none at all for quite a while.

675
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:35,670
Well if you see who does
then you may have a clue.

676
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:40,830
Well here is a list of the
early extensive colonisers.

677
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:46,400
My lead I mentioned to you from Asia
Minor currents on the isthmus Majora right

678
00:52:49,111 --> 00:52:51,510
next door to cars.

679
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:57,200
Also more or less on the isthmus then we
turned to the island of Nubia that long

680
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,630
island that's right next to
the east coast of Attica.

681
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:08,160
You'll be up there there
were two important cities
in the northern part of that

682
00:53:08,161 --> 00:53:12,520
island. One was Karl keys and
the other one was a red area.

683
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:18,140
And we hear about them relatively early
in the eighth century already being very

684
00:53:18,331 --> 00:53:22,930
important very strong and fighting each
other in a famous war that they fought.

685
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:28,670
But these cities were very active in
colonizing in a variety of directions.

686
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:34,130
Lots of these towns sent colonists up
north into the Aegean into the Dardanelles

687
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:36,090
and so on and beyond.

688
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,480
And some of the same cities send out
colonies to Sicily so that the real

689
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:43,980
colonizing states.

690
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:48,690
There was no limit to where they would
send people who wanted to go in those

691
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:49,524
areas.

692
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:54,800
It is also interesting to notice who
does not colonize at this early period.

693
00:53:55,950 --> 00:54:00,950
And the answer is place all the most
famous cities of Greece in the classical

694
00:54:02,131 --> 00:54:02,964
period.

695
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:08,150
Athens doesn't send out a colony until
sometime in the 6th century Sparta starts

696
00:54:09,811 --> 00:54:10,990
at an early point.

697
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:16,010
Sends out a colony to southern
Italy at some time probably early.

698
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:21,260
They sent out a colony to an
island in the Aegean Sea Milos.

699
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:26,190
And then they stopped.
And never sent out another colony.

700
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
And finally Thebes the great the
greatest city in Beersheba also does not

701
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:37,470
colonize. So what can we
speculate is the meaning of that.

702
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:43,460
What we find is that the states who are
doing most of the colonizing are located

703
00:54:43,861 --> 00:54:48,861
where most of the trade was going on at
this point in history and also most of

704
00:54:50,131 --> 00:54:51,180
the manufacturing.

705
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:54,930
When I say manufacturing you
understand everything is done by hand.

706
00:54:55,560 --> 00:55:00,560
But you see things like shops that
contain a number of slaves working for a

707
00:55:01,201 --> 00:55:02,034
master.

708
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:07,050
Some in some cases especially the later
on you go some shops that have quite a

709
00:55:07,051 --> 00:55:10,350
few slaves that work to
produce these things.

710
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:14,250
It's the handicraft industry but
it's an industry nonetheless.

711
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,460
Well these places are.

712
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:22,800
The ones that have the trade
the industry and also engage in

713
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:25,910
in colonization.

714
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:31,280
Moreover as we will see there will be
internal trouble in the form of political

715
00:55:32,941 --> 00:55:37,941
quarrelling economic
conflict and finally warfare.

716
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:43,370
Civil wars occur in some of these cities
leading to the emergence and in the

717
00:55:44,911 --> 00:55:49,911
next the next topic I'll turn to the
establishment of tyrannies as the way of

718
00:55:51,151 --> 00:55:52,560
resolving for a time.

719
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:57,860
These terribly tumultuous conditions
in those cities all of these things are

720
00:55:57,961 --> 00:56:02,961
true of places like Corinth and Mega
and possibly Karl Case and rhetoric.

721
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:05,423
So.

722
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:11,490
It is easy to see that where there
is that kind of conflict and trouble.

723
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:17,820
There would be people who would want
to flee that and to go elsewhere.

724
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:23,750
And it might well be that the the people
who won those wars internal wars would

725
00:56:26,191 --> 00:56:31,080
have been glad to send them away rather
than to have these discontented people

726
00:56:31,081 --> 00:56:34,950
in these folks who were their enemies
hanging around town and making trouble.

727
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,780
It's only speculation but
it's seems to make sense.

728
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:45,260
And we know we don't hear of such troubles
within Athens and thieves and Sparta

729
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:50,430
and it also is possible.

730
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:54,180
Again it's just speculation that.

731
00:56:55,260 --> 00:57:00,260
Population pressure might well be greater
in cities that did the colonizing they

732
00:57:02,341 --> 00:57:07,341
tended in general not to have as much
farmland as the places that I have

733
00:57:08,641 --> 00:57:13,641
described as not being colonizers who
may not have felt the pressures of land

734
00:57:14,881 --> 00:57:19,280
hunger which was so important
in motivating colonisation.

735
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:24,620
So though that may explain why some
of the states did and others did not.

736
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:32,370
Finally what are the consequences to the
Greek experience of this phenomenon of

737
00:57:34,571 --> 00:57:38,890
this outburst of colonisation.
Several things come to mind.

738
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:45,900
First of all the Greeks now live in
places where they never lived before and

739
00:57:47,201 --> 00:57:52,201
their presence has a real impact in
a different degree in every place.

740
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:59,490
I would say that typically their
impact was greater in the West.

741
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:05,130
And the North than it was
in the east and the South.

742
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:10,050
The reason for that was that in the
east and in South the Greeks lived among

743
00:58:10,051 --> 00:58:14,340
people who were more civilised
than they who were more advanced.

744
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:19,700
They had very little to teach or to
impose upon those people rather than vice

745
00:58:19,951 --> 00:58:20,784
versa.

746
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:25,850
I think I would imagine the Greeks
sopping up all sorts of useful and

747
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:30,120
interesting information from their
neighbors in the east and the south.

748
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,980
And there's no question about it.

749
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:35,610
If you look at Greece in this period I
don't know if I've used this term before

750
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:40,110
but some some scholars refer to this
general period talking about as the Greek

751
00:58:40,111 --> 00:58:44,730
Renaissance by analogy to
the Renaissance in Italy.

752
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:49,920
And there's something to it because
things happen in this period that are

753
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:51,960
revolutionary in the arts.

754
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:57,380
In the thinking of people philosophy
is going to be invented in my leaders

755
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:04,190
probably in the 6th century B.C. when
my leaders was on the main routes to all

756
00:59:05,581 --> 00:59:10,581
of the places where advance knowledge
could be found Mesopotamia Egypt

757
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:19,270
anybody who looks at Greek mythology
and Greek poetry and Greek stories sees

758
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:26,540
there is a powerful influence
coming into Greek thought.

759
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:30,500
From mainly the Mesopotamian direction.

760
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:35,400
Anybody who looks at the earliest
Greek art for quite some time.

761
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:40,990
I'm talking about sculpture and temple
building will see the influence of Egypt

762
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:45,140
enormously powerfully.

763
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:51,010
So the Greeks are sopping up tremendous
useful information and talent and skills

764
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:59,480
and all sorts of things that help
explain what's going to become.

765
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:03,830
It is inconceivable the Greeks could have
developed a civilisation that they did

766
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:09,100
without contact with these
Eastern civilizations and
learned a great deal from

767
01:00:11,061 --> 01:00:15,560
them. Now people some people
make an enormous jump from that.

768
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:20,480
And wrongly suggests that what the Greeks
basically did was well if you want to

769
01:00:20,481 --> 01:00:25,481
take the most extreme statement of it
stole and set their civilization from the

770
01:00:25,821 --> 01:00:26,650
other folks.

771
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:29,900
Well if you take a look at
Greek civilization let us
say in the classical period

772
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:33,770
those other cultures wouldn't have
had a clue what the Greeks were doing.

773
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,590
So different was the Greek
experience from theirs.

774
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:42,160
But what is undeniably true is that
the Greeks learned very important and

775
01:00:42,741 --> 01:00:47,741
valuable things and adapted what they
learned to their own way of life and

776
01:00:49,131 --> 01:00:54,131
produce something really quite new and
in many fundamental ways not only new but

777
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:59,480
the opposite of the places from
which these things had come.

778
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:02,100
There was also.

779
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:06,240
Of course some influence of
the Greeks on the people.

780
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:10,710
They went to an obviously I would start
out by saying this would probably have

781
01:01:10,711 --> 01:01:15,711
been felt most strongly in the West and
in the north where the peoples who lived

782
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:21,381
there before the Greeks came were not
civilized or not highly civilized they did

783
01:01:22,231 --> 01:01:26,520
not have great urban cultures
and civilizations long
traditions of learning and

784
01:01:26,521 --> 01:01:29,270
so on. No they weren't like that.
The Greeks were ahead of them.

785
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:34,640
And it's evident that the Greeks they
borrowed stuff from the Greeks that in

786
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:39,010
every element of life although it
didn't shape their lives in any potent

787
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,193
fundamental way.

788
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:44,850
But that's the way influence
ran in that part of the world

789
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:47,513
of course.

790
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:52,670
Another tremendously important consequence
of colonisation was the growth of

791
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:57,950
Commerce of trade for the
reasons I've already given you.

792
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:02,510
But beyond that the Greeks of course
now had access to foodstuffs and other

793
01:02:02,511 --> 01:02:07,511
things out and where they settled which
gave them a basis for trading with a

794
01:02:07,851 --> 01:02:11,090
mother city which meant there were markets
for them out of the city which they

795
01:02:11,091 --> 01:02:16,091
hadn't existed before but also the Greeks
were in touch with people beyond where

796
01:02:16,911 --> 01:02:21,911
they settled so they could obtain raw
materials that were not available before

797
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:27,400
and also manufactured things that they
might not have had and access access to

798
01:02:27,771 --> 01:02:28,604
before.

799
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:33,410
All of which they would have used some
for themselves and then engaged in trade

800
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,270
with the old Greek cities.

801
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:38,870
And you can see in other words you don't
need a very great imagination to see

802
01:02:38,871 --> 01:02:42,860
how this would be a terrific boon to
commerce which means think about it for a

803
01:02:42,861 --> 01:02:44,750
second but what will the business this be.

804
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:50,170
How will this affect what's happening
in the cities the Poles more and more

805
01:02:50,451 --> 01:02:51,284
people.

806
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:55,010
And again I want to remind you never
anything approaching a majority but more

807
01:02:55,011 --> 01:02:59,650
and more people would be making their
living in a way that was not agricultural.

808
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:05,030
They would be in commerce and they would
be an industry in this small sense and

809
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:08,540
doing all the various
things that are not farming.

810
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:13,930
And so you now have classes of groups
of people who have interests rather

811
01:03:14,451 --> 01:03:19,451
different from those of the most primitive
poles you could imagine and I would

812
01:03:21,111 --> 01:03:26,111
suggest some scholars early on the
century moved by Marx's theories suggested

813
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:30,310
that you had a capitalist class.
Growing up.

814
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:33,500
And that's there's just no
evidence of that. It's just wrong.

815
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:38,710
My guess is that the earliest
traders of any scope.

816
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:44,980
Were probably noblemen who also had
landed estates back home but who had the

817
01:03:45,111 --> 01:03:48,890
opportunity to know how the connections
to make it possible to make a lot of

818
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:49,724
living and trade.

819
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:54,950
Even so while you don't have a class
of separate people who are just in the

820
01:03:54,951 --> 01:03:59,951
business of making things and making money
you do have people who are engaged in

821
01:04:00,351 --> 01:04:05,351
those activities and who
have some interests that
are different from those the

822
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:08,170
rest of their people
who are only hotlines.

823
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:13,490
It is I think part of the conglomerate
of activities you want to keep in your

824
01:04:13,491 --> 01:04:17,570
mind what's going on here is what I'm
really trying to get at socially and

825
01:04:17,571 --> 01:04:22,570
economically and politically you have
to imagine on the one hand the hop light

826
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:26,840
revolution I do not shrink from saying
that but it's a very debatable term.

827
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:29,840
What.
Is going on.

828
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:34,870
That is more and more farmers are becoming
independent self-sustaining hop like

829
01:04:35,901 --> 01:04:40,850
farmers of the kind I've described and
they you can't expect them to continue to

830
01:04:40,851 --> 01:04:45,851
live in the same way as they did before
deferential to their betters that is to

831
01:04:46,521 --> 01:04:51,521
say tugging therefore locks before
they aristocrats and just leaving all

832
01:04:52,741 --> 01:04:56,360
decisions to the aristocratic cow they're
not going to feel the same way about

833
01:04:56,361 --> 01:04:56,750
it.

834
01:04:56,750 --> 01:05:01,750
There's going to be pressure from
them for a better participation in the

835
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:04,530
decisions that are made in the state.

836
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:10,150
And also there will be some rich people
very rich people rich in a different way

837
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:16,550
from the way people used to be
rich rich meant the best land.

838
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:21,890
Now there will be people who
will have wealth. In the form.

839
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:27,860
Of precious things. And I would
have I would use the word money.

840
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:31,640
I'm not going to use the word coinage
because that's very debated and anyway.

841
01:05:31,850 --> 01:05:34,880
There certainly weren't any coins
in Greece as early as say 750.

842
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,190
But that doesn't mean there was no money.

843
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:43,120
You could have weighed out precious metal
which would be money shekels as in the

844
01:05:45,891 --> 01:05:48,170
Bible originally not coins.

845
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:53,620
They are quantities weights of something
and come to mean weights of silver or

846
01:05:54,651 --> 01:05:55,484
gold.

847
01:05:55,610 --> 01:06:00,610
So now you have a change in fundamental
economic things is going on.

848
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:06,140
Well all of this is tied up with this
colonial story I've been telling you.

849
01:06:06,890 --> 01:06:11,890
And finally I think it works
in both directions at the
same time in terms of the

850
01:06:15,261 --> 01:06:20,261
impact all of these changes have on the
political situation on the one hand the

851
01:06:24,261 --> 01:06:29,261
changes that is a the rise of the Hop
like class B the development of lots of

852
01:06:31,311 --> 01:06:35,900
commerce and industry and
wealth and a new kind.

853
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:40,930
And people who don't fit into the old
traditional society but have a new way has

854
01:06:42,831 --> 01:06:46,040
to be found to fit them in
because as I say they don't fit.

855
01:06:48,110 --> 01:06:49,370
That creates trouble.

856
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:54,950
And as we shall see very shortly that
trouble often takes the form of first of

857
01:06:55,340 --> 01:07:00,340
factional struggles within the aristocracy
which then after a while come to

858
01:07:00,351 --> 01:07:05,351
involve people outside the aristocracy
which ultimately come to civil war in

859
01:07:05,811 --> 01:07:10,811
which certainly the people who have
become the most important fighting men the

860
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:16,480
hotlines become engaged on one side or
the other or perhaps sometimes on both.

861
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:21,740
So that's the what you might say
is the negative side of the story.

862
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:23,383
But.

863
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:28,570
Colonization especially some scholars
have pointed out I think persuasively also

864
01:07:29,361 --> 01:07:34,361
for some considerable time provided an
answer to that problem in the form of an

865
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:42,011
escape valve where you had these people
who were losers and angry and troubled

866
01:07:43,521 --> 01:07:48,521
or people who had in any case were not
happy with the way things were going in

867
01:07:48,921 --> 01:07:51,800
their mother city well they didn't
have to stay and fight it out.

868
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:57,130
They could go away and they did
in very considerable numbers.

869
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:02,800
And so one is easily reminded of the
American experience as it has often been

870
01:08:04,221 --> 01:08:09,221
interpreted in which the frontier is
seen to be a tremendously valuable safety

871
01:08:11,961 --> 01:08:16,961
valve to the Americans first as colonists
and then as independent people where

872
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:23,440
they didn't have the kinds of terrible
class warfare and the terrible warfare

873
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,940
within cities that the Europeans had
experienced throughout most of their

874
01:08:28,941 --> 01:08:33,941
history because really unhappy and angry
people could always go west to get new

875
01:08:35,391 --> 01:08:40,100
places.
I mean fundamentally Kansas is a colony.

876
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:44,610
In a certain Greek sense.
All of these places are.

877
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:50,030
So that was that's part of the story
of why America had a very lucky early

878
01:08:50,611 --> 01:08:51,444
history that it had.

879
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:56,400
And so I think we have to understand
that colonization provided something

880
01:08:56,401 --> 01:08:59,130
analogous to that for the.

881
01:09:00,810 --> 01:09:04,890
For the Greek people. So. Now here we are.

882
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,260
Somewhere in the seventh century.

883
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,760
Most of these places I've been
talking about have been several.

884
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:16,550
The currents that I have been describing
are flowing and the kinds of problems

885
01:09:17,221 --> 01:09:22,221
they give rise to will be felt in most
of the towns and that is the proper

886
01:09:24,571 --> 01:09:28,480
introduction to the next topic which
I'll discuss next year and next.

887
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:30,910
It seems like a year but
it's next Tuesday actually.
