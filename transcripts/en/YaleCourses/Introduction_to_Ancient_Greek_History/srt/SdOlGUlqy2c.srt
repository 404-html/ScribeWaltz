1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:06,050
Our topic today is the dark
ages and the world of homer.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,200
And of course you have,
uh,

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,180
as one of your reading assignments of
problem that deals precisely with that

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:18,970
question that asks the
subordinate questions. Uh,

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,630
was there a world,

6
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:25,710
a real world that Homer's poems refer to?

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,720
If so,
what world was it?

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,550
Was it the world of the
Mycenaean Bronze Age?

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:38,150
Was it the world that succeeded that
Bronze Age that we call the dark ages?

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,000
Was it,
uh,

11
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:46,150
the world in which we tradition says homer
himself lived that we think of as the

12
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:50,760
transition to the classical,
well,

13
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,460
first of the archaic and
into the classical period.

14
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:58,250
It's a period in which we think
about the dawn of the Polis. Uh,

15
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,170
that that really is the
question we are wrestling with.

16
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:03,360
And of course I'd behind
it all is the idea,

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,750
can we seek any historical information
from his Po Homer's poems at all?

18
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,900
It would be a terrible blow to me and
everybody else in the field if the answer

19
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:17,040
was no,

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,500
because just about everything we
have to say about this interim,

21
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,450
this period between the Bronze Age
and the emergence of the Polis, uh,

22
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,880
most of it involves inferences from our
understanding of what the Homeric poems

23
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,520
tell us.
Uh,

24
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:40,350
but I think we need to take a hard look
at what we can do and I thought it would

25
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:45,070
be worthwhile reading a
sentence each from the, uh,

26
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,020
uh,

27
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,020
introductory paragraphs that we provide
for you in the problem to show you the

28
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:54,630
range of opinion that is a pretty good,

29
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,470
pretty representative of what scholars
think or have thought on the subject.

30
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,230
Moses Finley says,

31
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,800
if then the world of Odysseus is to be
placed in time as everything we know from

32
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:12,531
the comparative study of heroic poetry
says it must be the most likely centuries

33
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,770
seem to be the 10th and the ninth.

34
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,740
That is to say what we call the dark ages.

35
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,880
Antony Andrews says,

36
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:28,881
it may be that the epic tradition had at
some stage used as a model for the army

37
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:30,120
before Troy.

38
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,900
An idealized version of some of those
bands of colonists who settled the coast

39
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,410
of Asia minor in post Mycenaean Times.

40
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,560
And if you look at the
whole story that he tells,

41
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:48,480
that really means quite soon after
the fall of the Mycenaean world,

42
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,780
probably maybe a century earlier
than what Findlay suggests.

43
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,840
And then, uh, am Snodgrass says,

44
00:02:57,841 --> 00:03:02,841
I offer this as a further argument against
the existence of a historical Homeric

45
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,003
society.

46
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,420
There isn't anything to be
found is what Snodgrass says.

47
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,310
Ian Morris writes,

48
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:17,311
the balance of probability seems to be
in favor of a consistent basis to the

49
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:22,591
society of the poems derived from
Greece in the eighth century BC,

50
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,510
which would be at the end of the period
we've been talking about the transition

51
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,840
to the world of the Polis Homer's
own time when he lived in rose.

52
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,820
And finally, Barry Strauss says,
ironically, the more homer exaggerates,

53
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:44,560
the more authentic he is as a
representative of the bronze age.

54
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,700
So what do we do? Well, all of these
are learned and clever men. Uh,

55
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,360
but I don't think that
they're all equally right. Uh,

56
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,420
but what I should also report to you
is that I think there is a widespread

57
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,410
consensus among most people
who study the subject.

58
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,630
That doesn't mean that
consensus is correct,

59
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,430
but not all of these opinions
are shared by the same number,

60
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,870
by no means of uh, scholars.
Some of them are far out.

61
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,410
I would say the one that says you can't
learn anything from this is an outlier.

62
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,810
The notion that this is about the
Mycenaean world is an outlier and then you

63
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:28,810
get,

64
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:33,810
I would say the largest consensus is
something like Finley's consensus,

65
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,750
but people verging in both directions.
From that,

66
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,330
what you'll hear from me is essentially
that consensus point of view.

67
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,530
It strikes me as being better
supported than the others,

68
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:58,771
but we really have to keep an open mind
because in this prehistoric period,

69
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,340
which really we were still
are in such a period,

70
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,360
you have to be very modest about
what you think you know about it.

71
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:14,730
Almost everything is inference
and judgment and very
little is anything that you

72
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:19,970
want to call proof with those warnings.
Let me tell you sort of what, what the,

73
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:24,370
what I think most people think about this.
First of all,

74
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,730
uh,
if we want to know about the dark ages,

75
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,860
what sources do we have available to us?

76
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:34,030
And of course I've already mentioned
the poems of homer turn out to be a very

77
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:38,620
large source, uh, for what
most people look to. Secondly,

78
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,830
there are legends that the Greeks
told about their early history,

79
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,860
uh,

80
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,860
which come down to us in later sources
and they are available to us to use a

81
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:54,730
source as a great question is should
we use them at all? And if we do,

82
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,430
how carefully should we use them?
And so on.

83
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,330
This is a good time for me
to make a confession so that
you'll know how to judge

84
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:05,860
what I say all through the course.
Um,

85
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,290
beginning,
well,

86
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,320
I'd say prior to the late 18th century
when a German scholar began to look at

87
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:18,710
the Homeric poems specifically very,

88
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,260
very carefully and then really very,

89
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:26,261
very skeptically and to make all sorts
of suggestions that the poems that we

90
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:32,891
have a really not to be thought
of as the work of a single poet,

91
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:38,531
homer who had brought them both out
together but who were began to divide them

92
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:40,580
up into early and late elements,

93
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:45,581
which I thought drove the field of
classics insane for about a hundred years.

94
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:49,730
While they are folks who argued
about the unity of homer, the unity,

95
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:52,130
or not the unity of one
of the poems and so on,

96
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,820
but it began a critical study of the
pumps for the first time and critical

97
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,400
methods are applied to history
for the first time ever,

98
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:05,570
really in a night,
early 19th century and thereafter.

99
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,430
And,
um,

100
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:12,970
it became common to reject any ancient
story that wasn't really nailed down

101
00:07:17,331 --> 00:07:17,631
very,

102
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:22,631
very firmly by some device
to take a skeptical view.

103
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,230
And an a very interesting
example of how things change.

104
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,500
If you look at people say English men
writing about ancient Greece in the late

105
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:34,910
18th century,

106
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,440
they tell the story of the early days
based upon the legends as though the

107
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:43,850
legends were reliable
information to some degree.

108
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,060
When you get to the,
uh,

109
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,870
say the middle of the 19th century in the
work of the great English historian of

110
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,370
Ancient Greece,
George Grote,

111
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,480
he begins his story in seven
76 with the Olympic Games.

112
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,810
He does tell you all
about the legends first,

113
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,280
but he puts them aside and says, they're
just legends. Now let's talk history.

114
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,540
And he doesn't begin that until
the eighth century BC. Uh,

115
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,240
and so there is this critical
school that says you,

116
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,710
I won't believe anything
unless it is proven to me.

117
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,460
At the other extreme,
there's me,

118
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,100
the most gullible historian imaginable.

119
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,440
My principle is this,

120
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:32,420
I believe anything written
in ancient Latin or Greek,

121
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,070
unless I can't now,

122
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:42,100
things that prevent me from believing
what I read are they are internally

123
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,860
contradictory or what
they say is impossible or
different ones contradict each

124
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:54,890
other and they can't both be
right. So in those cases, I,

125
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,730
the ancient evidence,

126
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,510
otherwise you've got to convince
me that they're not true.

127
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,380
Um, now you might think of
this as indeed gullible.

128
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,980
A colleague of a former colleague of
mine put the thing very, very well.

129
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,390
He spoke about,
and I like to claim this,

130
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:17,540
this approach to position a of scholarship
to which we'd call the higher naiveté

131
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,590
and hat.
The way this works is you start out,

132
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:27,720
you don't know anything and you're naive,
you believe everything.

133
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:32,640
Next you get a college education
and you don't believe anything.

134
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,960
And then you reach the level of wisdom
to hire knife tay and you know what to

135
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:44,410
believe, even though you
can't prove it. Okay. Be Worn.

136
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,130
I'm a practitioner of
the higher knife day.

137
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:54,710
So I think the way to deal with legends
is to regard them as different from,

138
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,390
uh, essentially sophisticated
historical statements,

139
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,400
but as possibly deriving from facts,

140
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,590
which have obviously been distorted
and misunderstood, misused and so on.

141
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,220
But it would be reckless.
It seems to me,

142
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,730
to just put them aside and
not ask yourself the question,

143
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,020
can there be something
believable at the root of this?

144
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,990
And just just to give you some
small defense of that approach,

145
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,010
I always like to ask you,

146
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:30,480
I suppose saying we didn't have
a single historical record,

147
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:32,250
no newspaper, no diaries, you know,

148
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:36,990
nothing totally reliable for what
happened in the latter part of the 18th

149
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:38,520
century in America.

150
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,800
Would we know anything about what
happened? Of course we would.

151
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,760
We would know that there was a revolution.
It was against Great Britain.

152
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:52,980
I'm sure we would know that the French
assisted in that I am certain we would

153
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:57,981
know that George Washington was the
commander of our forces in that battle.

154
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,490
Those are easy. There's no getting
around. We'd know those things. Then then,

155
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:04,890
then it gets to be more
interesting as we speculate.

156
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:09,870
We would know as a fact that George
Washington through a silver dollar across

157
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:14,610
the Rappahannock river, except that it's
impossible so he could dismiss that one.

158
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,140
We would be told that he was very honest
and told his father he chopped down a

159
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:23,520
cherry tree, which would be baloney.
But we would be told that too.

160
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:28,550
But I think we would be told also very
many true things which came down to us.

161
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:33,651
So the hard job would be to select among
these legendary things to see what fact

162
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:38,790
can be found. Then it will never be
easier or deadly certain. But that's,

163
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,860
that's what I'm talking about
here. Um, finally there is the,

164
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,770
uh,
the source that people who are skeptical,

165
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:51,210
most liked to believe because it's
tangible. I'm talking about archeology,

166
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:56,930
which is the discovery and examination
and valuation of material evidence that

167
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:03,541
is not in writing the actual
remains of places where they lived,

168
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:07,180
the implements that they
used and so on and so on.

169
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,860
And the beautiful thing about that is
you actually have it. It's objective.

170
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:15,070
It's an object.
It's not something that somebody imagined,

171
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:19,630
but you shouldn't derive
as much confidence from it
as a lot of archaeologists

172
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:24,631
like to because it's only a thing until
you say what it means until you put a

173
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:28,430
date on it. Until you, uh,

174
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,980
try to understand what it really is,
what its function was,

175
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,410
who brought it there,
who left it there.

176
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,380
All those things have to be
reasoned out from the, uh,

177
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:43,810
all the evidence, all the information
you can get. So there's a store,

178
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:48,811
an astonishing amount of speculation
involved in establishing this apparently

179
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,030
rigorous objective technique.

180
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,770
You certainly need to use it and we need
to use it as carefully. That's my point.

181
00:12:56,771 --> 00:13:01,480
As carefully as we use everything else.
But it is indeed very valuable.

182
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:06,130
And studying a world before
our time, uh, always.

183
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,160
Now we've mentioned how
important the poems are.

184
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,910
So we need to take a look at the question
of what they are and how we know about

185
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:20,470
them. And so on. I mentioned
to you that, uh, these,

186
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,371
the Iliad,

187
00:13:21,371 --> 00:13:25,660
the Odyssey when known in the Western
world continuously from the time that they

188
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:28,000
were made available,
uh,

189
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,010
so they will know and they
were very important in the,

190
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,930
in the minds of those people
who knew about it. But, um,

191
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,800
I also mentioned last time the
impact of [inaudible] excavations,

192
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:47,100
which turned everything around the
hypers skeptical point of view taken by

193
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:52,381
scholars in Europe in the 19th century
was eroded very sharply by the discovery

194
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:58,990
of places that really convinced pretty
much everybody soon that they were Troy

195
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,550
and that they were my CV.

196
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:05,610
And so the stories couldn't have been
simple inventions and that began a new

197
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:10,720
phase in the story. And again,
to repeat what I said last time,

198
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:15,721
there was certain stunning physical
resemblances between what homer said and

199
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:18,220
what we could see.

200
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,060
The palaces were like the
palaces that he described.

201
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:27,630
The world that they lived in was a world
in which bronze was what was used for

202
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:32,380
implements and weapons and such,

203
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,320
not iron and that squared with,
um,

204
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,170
what was found in my Sini,
what was found and the Mycenaean world,

205
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,610
namely bronze implements and
fundamentally not orange ones.

206
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,030
Sometimes there was a,

207
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,270
there were interesting little problems
that emerged. And one of those,

208
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:57,260
it has to do with the use
of chariots in warfare.

209
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,320
Well,
homer has,

210
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:04,520
Cherry has his heroes
using cherries and people.

211
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:06,950
And we know,
excuse me,

212
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:11,951
we know the chariots were used in
warfare in the bronze age around the

213
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:14,960
Mediterranean Sea.

214
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,960
We have hard evidence of that in
Egypt and Asia minor and in the Tigris

215
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,690
Euphrates valley.
So you would say,

216
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:26,240
well that's another place
where homer got it right,

217
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:31,990
except for the fact that we also know
how chariots are used in warfare.

218
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,750
And uh,
the closest analogy I think is distance.

219
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,460
Think of chariots as tanks. Uh, you know,

220
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:45,440
one famous tactic as if you, if you have
an infantry force coming forward, uh,

221
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:50,630
you send tanks in it to break up the
line of the infantry and so that you can

222
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,420
defeat the infantry in that way.

223
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:58,450
And apparently that is the way you use
chariots in ancient bronze age warfare.

224
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,600
You would send the chariot racing toward
the line of infantry men and the usual

225
00:16:06,111 --> 00:16:11,111
outcome was the infantry men would panic
in the face of being charged by these

226
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:16,870
things and would break their line and
give the other side and opportunity to a

227
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,000
wreck havoc with their army.
Well,

228
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:25,400
what did the Homeric heroes
do with their charities?

229
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,550
They use them as taxi cabs,

230
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:35,510
Achilles or patrol Patroclus
or whoever is on his chariot,

231
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,580
does the driver in front who's driving,

232
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,500
he is writing down from the ships or
wherever he is from the camp to the

233
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:47,330
battlefield. He might pick up
a, uh, a missile of some kind,

234
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:52,280
a spear typically and fire
it at somebody as he goes by.

235
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:57,440
This would be a drive
by killing. And, uh, uh,

236
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:02,030
but then when he really gets to where
the action is, he hops off and gets it.

237
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,350
Now we're going to have some five.

238
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,790
And so the implication
I think is that the Ma,

239
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:12,820
the memory of chariot warfare back
in the Mycenaean days lingered was,

240
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:18,740
was captured in the poetry that goes back
the bits of the poetry that goes back

241
00:17:20,181 --> 00:17:24,860
to the Mycenaean period.
But how they were used was forgotten.

242
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,690
And so the poets in the
subsequent years then thought,

243
00:17:29,691 --> 00:17:33,680
how would I use a chariot? Never having
seen a chariot fight in a battle.

244
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:37,200
And that's the outcome. So at this, uh,

245
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:41,570
Findlay particularly makes a lot of this
as being rather indicative of how he

246
00:17:41,571 --> 00:17:45,740
pictures the poems work.
There are sort of legitimate memories,

247
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:49,130
some of them going way back
to the Mycenaean period,

248
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,300
but which may be misremembered
in some significant detail. Uh,

249
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:57,630
and then of course there's lots of stuff
that doesn't have anything to do with

250
00:17:57,631 --> 00:18:00,720
the Mycenaean period.
His view is much,

251
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:05,721
if not most of what we are told about
the Homeric world comes as he says in the

252
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:11,310
10th and the ninth centuries.
Um,

253
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,720
one other thing, um,
that he doesn't mention,

254
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:18,300
but I think it's worth mentioning a many,

255
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:23,301
a scholar is very reluctant to admit
that there's any Mycenae and stuff here,

256
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,601
whatever,

257
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:29,601
although they cannot fail to concede
that some of the physical implements that

258
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:34,611
are found at Mycenae and sites are
precisely like what homer says.

259
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,430
But I think you can go a
little bit beyond that.

260
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,440
Some scholars have pointed out that in
book two of the Elliott in the section

261
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:45,510
that we call the catalog of ships,

262
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:50,990
the poet lays out just exactly how
many warships came to Troy from Greece.

263
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:58,190
And just exactly how many came from each
town and the names of the towns that

264
00:19:00,421 --> 00:19:02,280
are listed in that catalog of ships.

265
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:07,281
First of all are all legitimate in the
sense every one of them we know did exist

266
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,220
in the Mycenaean period and perhaps no
less significant is that there are also

267
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:18,480
towns listed there that
are Mycenaean towns,

268
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,640
which disappeared after the
Mycenaean period. In other words,

269
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:27,000
they couldn't just have named towns
that used to be Mycenaean but was still

270
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:31,200
around. So they, that's why they knew
them. No, sometimes it that disappeared.

271
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,590
The names of those towns show
up in the catalog of ships.

272
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:39,210
There's just no way to explain that
except to say that catalog of ships goes

273
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:43,830
back to the Mycenaean period.
Now,

274
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:49,190
the differences between what we find
in the Homeric poems are also very

275
00:19:49,531 --> 00:19:54,120
illuminating differences between that
and what we know happened after the fall

276
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:56,100
of the Mycenaean world.
For instance,

277
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,920
one of the most striking things
that you find in cultures,

278
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:01,800
anthropologists and
archeologists live off.

279
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:04,800
This is how what they do with dead bodies.

280
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,190
Now my Sini,

281
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,750
it's obvious they bury them in
the ground that as most of us do,

282
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,950
the, uh, the graves in the
circle, the shaft graves,

283
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:18,990
and then that the beehive
tombs for the big shots.

284
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,610
But even outside the country side,

285
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,710
we find graves which have
bones of people in them.

286
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,520
But we know that the Greeks in,
uh,

287
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:34,440
in homer don't do that.
The Greeks and homer have,

288
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:39,270
uh, incinerate the bodies
of the dead. You remember,

289
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,720
um, uh, the, the, um,

290
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,980
the Elliot ends with the,

291
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:51,050
the actual cremation of the
bodies of the relevant people.

292
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:54,100
So that's a very significant difference.

293
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:58,420
That memory had simply died out.
And it helps us to remember to

294
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,000
the, uh, tombs that we
know we have seen now.

295
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,920
They didn't see that whoever
was writing the poems of homer,

296
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:14,560
whichever, see, uh, poets were
contributing to that over the ages.

297
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:16,810
After the Mycenaean period.

298
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,410
They hadn't seen those Mycenaean sites.
They were buried.

299
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,323
Um,

300
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:27,780
there are also differences sometimes in
the shape of weapons that we find in the

301
00:21:28,361 --> 00:21:33,361
Greek world after the Mycenaean period
compared to what are described in Homer's

302
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,720
poems. And, uh, also, um, I'm sorry. Yeah.

303
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:42,810
Homer describes certain of these weapons
which don't fit what we find in the

304
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:46,870
ground. Um, and here's another,

305
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:51,670
a critical element in the story.
The,

306
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:58,140
we know that the Mycenaeans or at least
some small number of them could write

307
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:02,410
because we have the linear B script,
which we can read.

308
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:07,890
There is no clue that there is such a
thing as writing in the Homeric poems is

309
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:14,020
one very abstruse clue where somebody
seems to know something about it.

310
00:22:14,021 --> 00:22:19,021
But fundamentally it's an illiterate
society and that is a major difference

311
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,990
between the world of homer
and the Mycenaean world.

312
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:27,670
Some other differences,
Homer's kings,

313
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,290
if you just see how they live,
what they do,

314
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,240
what their wives do,

315
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,690
how they are treated by
their fellow nobleman,

316
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,160
they are an irrelative sense,
very weak,

317
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,760
very short on power and really quite poor
compared to these Mycenaean kings that

318
00:22:51,101 --> 00:22:56,101
were the results of whose work and
lives we see at places like [inaudible].

319
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,720
I remember I tried to emphasize how rich
you would have to be to undertake the

320
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:06,811
building of the temple to undertake the
construction of one of those beehive

321
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:08,044
tombs.

322
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:13,180
You had to be a very confident because
it was going to take a long time,

323
00:23:13,181 --> 00:23:16,780
fantastic amount of labor,
a tremendous amount of money to do that.

324
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,840
There is no evidence in homer that anybody
had that kind of wealth or that kind

325
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,210
of power.
What do the,

326
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,470
what do the Queens in homer
do in their spare time?

327
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:34,570
Or maybe it's not their spare time.
Maybe it's their regular time. Well,

328
00:23:34,571 --> 00:23:38,250
one of the things that they do,
in fact, when you, when, when, uh,

329
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,140
the Homeric heroes referb to their wives,
they're there.

330
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,970
There were really only two places
that they seem to be associated with.

331
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,420
One is the bedroom and
the other is the loom.

332
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:57,080
What these ladies are
doing is weaving cloth.

333
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,200
Now that's not what Queens do.

334
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,250
I'm sure the Mycenaean Queen's
didn't do that, but it's very,

335
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:08,300
very interesting that that is
where the Homeric queens do that.

336
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:10,760
Well,

337
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,760
how are we to explain the discrepancies
that are so great between these worlds?

338
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:22,930
And the answer that almost everybody now
accepts without argument is that these

339
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:25,730
poems were,
uh,

340
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:30,910
created orally and passed on orally
that they were not written down.

341
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:39,160
And so that what we have in the poems
of homer reflects centuries of bards

342
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:47,410
passing on bits of the poem of the
poem and various versions being always

343
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:49,070
creative.
I mean,

344
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:53,990
any barred if by analogy we know
about bards in the modern world,

345
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:59,120
we have some evidence on that.
Milman parry was a,

346
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,970
he's a Harvard scholar back in the 20s,

347
00:25:01,971 --> 00:25:06,470
went to Yugoslavia to live in
the mountains in the backwoods.

348
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:11,860
And he lived with people who were still
had these bards around who created sort

349
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:16,970
of epic narratives of considerable length,

350
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,170
nothing resembling Homeric length,
I must say. Nothing that long,

351
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:26,410
but long enough in which they would tell
the same stories in verse and music.

352
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:32,630
Uh, and you could recognize the
story as you went from bar to bar,

353
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:38,170
but every bard added and subtracted
things to suit his own talents.

354
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,290
That's the idea of the game.

355
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,680
And then Perry demonstrated by careful
scholarship of the Homeric poems that

356
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:52,760
that is the way the Homeric poems were.
In fact,

357
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:57,380
I want to use the word stitched together
because in the ancient Greek world,

358
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,350
the people who sang, recited,
created, uh, the poems of Ho, uh,

359
00:26:02,351 --> 00:26:07,090
of the, of the Homeric epics
were called wraps sodas.

360
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:11,000
And that means stitchers of songs.

361
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,920
So what you have to
imagine is sometime back,

362
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,460
I would argue in the
Mycenaean Mycenaean period,

363
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,060
somebody began making
up one of these songs,

364
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:28,061
telling the story of Greeks
going to attack the city of Troy.

365
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,880
And that for centuries thereafter,

366
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:36,770
different wraps odes repeated that.
But elucidated that,

367
00:26:36,771 --> 00:26:40,330
illuminated, that extended it, changed it,

368
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:43,800
try to improve it.
And uh,

369
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,040
sometimes they added stuff they
were alive in the 10th century.

370
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:48,510
Some of them are alive in the ninth,

371
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:52,350
and certainly some of them are alive
from the time of homer in the eighth.

372
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,393
So that,

373
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,690
that what we have before
us is that kind of product.

374
00:26:57,691 --> 00:27:02,691
And that will explain both the
similarities and the differences.

375
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:08,790
And that is what underlies
our interpretation of how
the poems got to be what

376
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:12,120
they were.
So what world,

377
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:17,010
what does this world like that
emerges from the world of homer.

378
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,470
Even we don't have to make
up our minds in advanced,

379
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,890
whether it was a real world
or a completely fantastic one,

380
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:28,500
but at least let's see if we can
describe what world it looks like.

381
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:33,750
And I'm going to focus my attention on
the what you might call the political

382
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,440
side of that society as it
reveals itself in the poems

383
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,200
we hear about key individuals.

384
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,120
Uh,

385
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,380
and I've used last time I mentioned
to you two words I think I did,

386
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:56,610
but I'll mention that again this time
the,

387
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,790
the head of the expedition
to Troy Agamemnon,

388
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:05,270
that sort of general and mo of that
expedition is called one knocks.

389
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,570
When you dropped the WWE as
a Greek later dialects did,

390
00:28:09,571 --> 00:28:13,050
it becomes anoxic in later Greek.

391
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,660
He is so far as I know,
and I think I'm not forgetting I,

392
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:23,340
he's the only human being
referred to in the poems.

393
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,750
In that way.

394
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,680
There are however many of an individual
in the palm who is referred to is a

395
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,060
boss, allows the plural, is bossy lace,

396
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,600
which is normally and
regularly translated as king.

397
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,710
And that's, that's right. For instance,

398
00:28:43,711 --> 00:28:48,711
in historical times when
the Greeks referred to the
Great King of Persia who was

399
00:28:49,801 --> 00:28:54,290
a real king and a powerful figure
figure king in every sense, uh,

400
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,060
the word they used for him was bossy less.

401
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:02,510
But we quickly see that the people
referred to as Bacillus in homer,

402
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,260
uh,
are not like the great king of Persia.

403
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,920
They are a much lesser figures.

404
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,050
I'll come back to that in just a moment.

405
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:21,740
The Mycenaean kings we know thanks to
the linear B tablets were referred to the

406
00:29:22,621 --> 00:29:27,621
singular once again is one ox
and the plural is one act tests.

407
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,920
But in homer the term is reserved for
Agamemnon or for Gods but not for any

408
00:29:35,821 --> 00:29:39,120
other human being.
And that raises the question,

409
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,820
why is Agamemnon one us?

410
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,600
And that I think we have to understand
as being big because of his function in

411
00:29:49,451 --> 00:29:54,000
the situation. Namely,
there is a multi city,

412
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,020
uh, invasion of Troy being carried
on by these Mycenaean Greeks.

413
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:04,410
Agamemnon has been chosen as the general
list demo and that is what gives him

414
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:11,170
temporarily the title of one
ox. I would, I would imagine,

415
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:14,230
I'm very confident that
after the war of Troy,

416
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:18,220
if Agamemnon had been allowed by his
wife to live for more than a few minutes

417
00:30:18,221 --> 00:30:20,560
after he set foot at home,

418
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,740
he would no longer be called one ox,

419
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:29,070
but would be called boss allows like
the other rulers of their local towns.

420
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,333
Uh,
your mirror,

421
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:35,650
you remember I suggested
that in the linear B tablets,

422
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:38,620
when there's a reference
to a bus, Laos, uh,

423
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,800
he's clearly well below the one ox and
some scholars suggest in a persuasive

424
00:30:45,371 --> 00:30:49,720
way. I think that these Busta Laos
may have been village chieftains,

425
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,150
but that's as high as they got.

426
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:57,460
But it's very interesting that
when you get to historical grease,

427
00:30:57,461 --> 00:31:01,630
as we shall see,
there are no one knock tastes,

428
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,920
but there are, at least according
to tradition, bossy lays.

429
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,280
But there's no, no bustle. Laos has
anything like the clout that the uh,

430
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,700
uh,
mycenaen kings did.

431
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,800
And of course we don't hear
of any of them who have the,

432
00:31:17,801 --> 00:31:21,670
even the temporary special power
that Agamemnon has. Nobody,

433
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:26,671
no human being is referred to as one
ox in the period of historical Greece.

434
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:32,350
And of course the kings
when we see them in homer,

435
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:37,240
do not have a bureaucracy,
do not have scribes.

436
00:31:37,241 --> 00:31:39,280
How could there be scribes?
They didn't know how to write.

437
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,920
There are no inventories.

438
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:46,921
These are not rich guys with fantastic
quantities of stuff that has to be

439
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,060
cataloged and inventoried.

440
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,390
The kings by our standards for
kings are really very poor.

441
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:59,380
What do they do in their spare
time or in their time in general?

442
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,920
They themselves engage in agriculture.

443
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,860
I don't mean they dig in the ground
but they supervise it but they,

444
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,310
they think about it.
They are like uh,

445
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,750
people who are in charge of a
plantation there own plantation. I mean,

446
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,660
so that's one of their activity.

447
00:32:16,661 --> 00:32:20,770
You cannot imagine the great
kings of my Sini doing that.

448
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:24,670
They would have had all kinds of
subordinate officials taken care of that.

449
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,200
The another thing that these kings
are seeing to do, which is in a way,

450
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:32,560
even at a lower level,
is to be herdsman. Again,

451
00:32:32,561 --> 00:32:35,740
not themselves out there
with the goats and the sheep,

452
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,550
but refer to as having these herds
and having to cope with them.

453
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,160
Another very popular,

454
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:47,300
I would say the most popular activity
among the king's popular with the Kings

455
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,500
was piracy.
That's what they brag about.

456
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:57,470
Kelly's my God bought a king.
He is, he sacked 24 cities.

457
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:03,130
Why do you Saca City to
steal what they have and of,

458
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:08,900
well, there are all kinds of wonderful
examples. Uh, people, uh, in the,

459
00:33:08,901 --> 00:33:12,210
in the Iliad, the Odyssey,
some stranger comes,

460
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:16,640
this is in the Odyssey and the,
they ask him a sir,

461
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:21,440
are, are you a pirate?
And he says, no, no,

462
00:33:21,441 --> 00:33:25,010
I'm not a pirate. Just like they asked
him. Um, I mean, you come from Chicago,

463
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:29,660
it's a, that's he, he wasn't
insulting. He didn't, I don't know.

464
00:33:29,661 --> 00:33:34,640
I'm not a pirate, but am I
could have been. Of course
we understand that. But, um,

465
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:40,460
and then, but later on in the story
that, uh, hotels in the Odyssey,

466
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:45,740
Odysseus himself is such a newcomer. He
comes, he's taken to the beautiful city,

467
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,930
uh, on the island is
scarier if ea Hsa and, uh,

468
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:54,980
treated with great respect as you're
supposed to be in the Mycenaean world.

469
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:59,000
But after dinner, they, uh,

470
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,010
they do what they do to amuse themselves.

471
00:34:01,011 --> 00:34:04,970
They have athletic contests and they
ask, oh, just use to participate.

472
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,350
And he says, no, no, I'm too miserable
and wretched. And the guy says, oh yeah,

473
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,490
you must be some kind of a merchant.

474
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:17,890
And, uh, with issues is,

475
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,650
that was a black remark.

476
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,080
And, uh, those are fighting
words. You can't call,

477
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:31,340
we know just uses himself as a, a
laussane. You don't call him a merchant.

478
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,680
Pirate Short merchant know.

479
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,513
Um,

480
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:42,730
another thing that is interesting is that
when you look at the burials of Greeks

481
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,790
in the post Mycenaean
period and the dark ages,

482
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:52,270
there's nothing resembling those grand
tombs and the wealth that's buried in

483
00:34:52,971 --> 00:34:54,500
them for the dead.

484
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,280
You find that the tunes of nobleman are
very much the same one as the other.

485
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,880
You're struck by the equality from
the standpoint of riches of the dead.

486
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,950
Uh, nobility. No,

487
00:35:09,951 --> 00:35:13,160
no great distinction and
no great riches either.

488
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:17,780
You're dealing with a poor world and
a world that doesn't have this kind of

489
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,310
outstanding monarchy.
So,

490
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,433
uh,

491
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,320
one of the things I think we learned
is that the Homeric world of the Kings,

492
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:32,330
the role of the Kings, the wealth of
the kingdom, the power of the Kings,

493
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:36,500
the place of the kings is not
taken from the Mycenaean period.

494
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,870
If it's describing anything that's real,

495
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:45,570
it's describing very clearly
a post Mycenaean world, uh,

496
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,450
in those dark ages that we
have been talking about.

497
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,440
But another thing that crops
up is that in the Iliad,

498
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,913
the Odyssey,

499
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:01,730
you get a very clear picture really of
what is the political structure of each

500
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,490
society.
And by the way,

501
00:36:05,491 --> 00:36:10,080
you must keep in mind a very important
difference between the Iliad and the

502
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:12,990
Odyssey.
The Iliad takes place at Troy.

503
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,710
None of these noblemen,
none of these kings,

504
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:20,760
none of these heroes is back
home in his own town ruling it.

505
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:25,020
He is at war and he is
serving under a commander.

506
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:30,170
And so the behavior of these people
towards one another is not precisely like

507
00:36:30,451 --> 00:36:34,170
what it would be and here you see in the
Odyssey is what it would likely be and

508
00:36:34,171 --> 00:36:39,171
the place where you see it is as back
in Ithica when a is there or when we're

509
00:36:39,571 --> 00:36:41,880
taking to see what's going on.

510
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:44,130
I think that's a very
important distinction to make.

511
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:49,130
But even when they were Troy and in this
other sort of non a typical situation,

512
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:55,430
we still see the same institutions working
the same relationships being present

513
00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:01,140
as a would be present at home. Although
you have to watch out for the difference.

514
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:05,520
What do I mean?
How are decisions made?

515
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,680
Does the king simply say
do it and it gets done?

516
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,600
Nothing like that.

517
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:17,070
The king has got important powers.

518
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:20,130
Agamemnon has the chief
out there in the Iliad.

519
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,250
He can call a meeting of the assembly,

520
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,920
but it turns out he's
not the only one of the,

521
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,780
I should say if the council
will come to that in a minute,

522
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:33,330
but he's not the only one who can.
Any nobleman who wants to can say,

523
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:38,220
we ought to have a counseling and then
the council will come together and do

524
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:42,150
whatever business they wish
to do. The council, however,

525
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,950
is limited to nobleman
to these Boston lace.

526
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,520
Ordinary soldiers do not attend.

527
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,630
And that's one of the things I
think we must grasp immediately.

528
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,200
The key line in the society of the Dark
Ages appears to be certainly not between

529
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,710
monarchy and everybody else,

530
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,230
but between nobility and commoners.

531
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:18,540
That's the really
important serious line up.

532
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:21,120
Certainly politically and
in other ways as well.

533
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,750
There is however,

534
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
a in homer and assembly
that consists of the men.

535
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,690
In the case of Troy,

536
00:38:33,691 --> 00:38:37,930
of course the fighting men who were
there but who are not bossy delays,

537
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,890
but also in the,
in the home at home,

538
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,520
the men of fighting age and condition,

539
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,580
they are the only ones
who matter of course,

540
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,980
as in all of the rest of Greek history,

541
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:56,560
women are excluded from the political
realm. Uh, and of course, uh,

542
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:01,240
well I'll just leave it at that.
Uh, but so too are the, uh,

543
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,940
uh, there's a, there's
obviously an age limit.

544
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:06,610
You have to be of an age
to be a fighting man.

545
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:11,770
It's not necessarily defined for us.
It depends on the could have been 18,

546
00:39:11,771 --> 00:39:16,150
could have been 20 in a, in Athens
in classical times. It was 20.

547
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:20,650
Um, well that, let, let,

548
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:24,850
let me just remind you of some events
that show you how these things work.

549
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:30,970
Remember the Elliot starts because of a
quarrel and the quarrel emerges from the

550
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:35,971
fact that the Greek Sir Bisley
being killed by a terrible
plague that has struck

551
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:40,330
them. Uh, they said, we've got
to find out what's happening,

552
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:43,870
why they always assumed that if
something like that happened,

553
00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:47,260
it was some God or gods
who was angry with them.

554
00:39:47,261 --> 00:39:50,710
So they get a seer who goes and says,

555
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:54,970
is persuaded to try to
find out what's happening.

556
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:59,971
And he finally does ascertain that
Apollo is angry with the Greeks because

557
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:06,450
Agamemnon took a maiden
from her father and that,

558
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:13,880
uh, father was a priest
of Apollo. And so, uh,

559
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:18,610
when this is ascertained,
the Achilles, the biggest,

560
00:40:18,611 --> 00:40:23,140
bravest, strongest,
fastest, a hero, uh, on the,

561
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:26,320
on the Greek side intervenes
and says, well, look,

562
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:31,321
why don't you give back the girl and
then Apollo will stop killing us and

563
00:40:32,351 --> 00:40:34,600
everything would be okay.
Ag I'm in him,

564
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:38,410
gets furious with Achilles and he says,
no,

565
00:40:38,411 --> 00:40:43,030
I'm not giving back my girl. I'm the
boss here. See as Edward G. Robinson,

566
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:45,660
he used to say,
and um,

567
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,660
how many of you ever heard of Edward G.
Robinson? Just raise your hand, please.

568
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:54,970
Good. Put me in my place and it
gets worse every year for me. Um,

569
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,550
and um,

570
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:03,630
Achilles then speaks up and really let
some have it chosen that tells him what a

571
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:07,030
Bozo is. Uh, and

572
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,310
you know,

573
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:12,310
there's very important thing is how
can you do that if this is the king?

574
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:16,870
And the answer is you can do
that because you're both kings.

575
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:22,380
There is nothing out of line in the sense
of violating some kind of a real rule

576
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,910
of the society.
But it's not typical.

577
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:32,940
And especially since Agamemnon
has this position as the boss,

578
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:38,230
the most kingly of the kings, that's the
word that homer uses of him. Bossy loop,

579
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:42,800
top toss, the most kingly. And
that's because of his position.

580
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:48,340
So Achilles is not doing anything
sort of illegal or unconstitutional,

581
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,730
but he's doing something that's really
out of line from a normal point of view.

582
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:56,050
And finally, Agamemnon says, no,
I'm not going to give back my girl,

583
00:41:56,051 --> 00:41:59,840
but tell you what, uh, I'll finally,

584
00:41:59,841 --> 00:42:04,841
I will give back my girl if I am given
the girl you took from a different Trojan

585
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:11,510
and that'll be fine. I'll have
your girl and you won't have any.

586
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:17,950
So now Achilles really blows its top.
And uh,

587
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,270
from the quarrel, I'm
finally when he says, okay,

588
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:24,650
if that's what you're going to do to me,
I'm taking my armor and I'm going home.

589
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:30,140
And off he goes and he soaks in
his tent for the next nine books.

590
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:35,790
And uh, this turns out to be a
serious problem for them. So that,

591
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:40,810
but that what you learn from that
is that the way decisions are made,

592
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:46,180
important decisions are made even in this
army is by discussion among the bossy

593
00:42:48,561 --> 00:42:51,630
lace among the nobleman. And, uh,

594
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,950
you will try to reach a
consensus about these things.

595
00:42:54,951 --> 00:42:57,560
And in an extreme odd situation like this,

596
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:01,430
it would have to be that they would
have to do what the commander says,

597
00:43:01,431 --> 00:43:04,620
but it would, and probably
back home. That would be the,

598
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:09,560
the implication that if you can't work
things out among them with consensus,

599
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:13,160
probably the king has some,
some weight.

600
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:17,420
But what we have to remember is you
can't give orders to anybody typically,

601
00:43:17,421 --> 00:43:21,830
although Agamemnon can get away
with it on this expedition. Well,

602
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:25,310
that's one story and other stories that
we're told is that soon afterwards,

603
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,890
also in that same place in the Elliot,

604
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:32,480
a dream comes to Agamemnon, cause
you know, this is their 10th year.

605
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:35,420
They've been trying to take this
city for nine years. It's, uh,

606
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,440
it's almost as bad as
Iraq. Um, and people are,

607
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:44,050
the soldiers are tired of all of this.
If we can't take the city, we, um,

608
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,880
we ought to go home.
And there's a lot of,

609
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,480
is a spirit that says we
ought to go home. And so, uh,

610
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:55,250
a dream comes to a Agamemnon.
The God says to him,

611
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,200
here's what you need to do.

612
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:01,960
You need to try the spirit
of your men and two in,

613
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:06,260
in that way too in spirit them
to carry on until victory.

614
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:11,710
So what you should do is to get up and
speak to your soldiers and say that

615
00:44:12,381 --> 00:44:15,050
you're never going to take, uh, Troy.

616
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:19,730
You might as well pack up and go home
and then they'll say, no king, no,

617
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,610
we refuse to do that.
We insist on staying,

618
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,630
we're going to re re up and do another
term and we're going to take the city.

619
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,360
So agrimonia says, great, I'll do that.

620
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:34,650
And he calls the troops again the battle
and he makes his little speech and then

621
00:44:34,651 --> 00:44:37,350
I can, I wish I could reproduce the
home or I didn't take it along with me.

622
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:42,680
But the essence of it is in a
great roar and rumble emerge.

623
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
There's the troops turned and began racing
back to the ships to get the hell out

624
00:44:48,691 --> 00:44:49,524
of there.

625
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:54,570
Just to carry on some of the highlights
of that story that tell us a little bit,

626
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,900
a lot really about the society.
So as they're roaring back,

627
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,070
suddenly Odysseus to slice the cleverest,

628
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,260
the smartest of all of the Greeks.

629
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:07,650
He goes racing among the
troops who are heading back in.

630
00:45:07,651 --> 00:45:12,040
He grabs one and homer says,
when he came to a gentleman,

631
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:15,780
a boss, the lace who say,
sir, you are making a mistake.

632
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,320
You don't understand the game
that Agamemnon is playing.

633
00:45:19,321 --> 00:45:21,000
And he explains it to them.
And the guy said, okay,

634
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:26,340
when he comes to one of the common
sort, he says, you bloody imbecile.

635
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,350
Get the hell back to where you belong.
That's a rough translation. And,

636
00:45:31,351 --> 00:45:32,184
uh,

637
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:36,620
everybody finally grabs enough of
them and the thing turns around,

638
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:41,250
everybody goes back and sits down and,
uh,

639
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:45,780
up steps,
one man

640
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,180
suit,
uh,

641
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:52,830
homework describes him as the
ugliest man in the entire army.

642
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:57,560
So you get a clue as to what we're
supposed to think about him. And uh, he,

643
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,440
he makes his speech,

644
00:45:58,441 --> 00:46:03,441
which denounces all of the Basa
Lace Agamemnon ahead of any of them.

645
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:05,363
And he says,

646
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,400
we ordinary soldiers have had enough and
we would like to go home and up steps

647
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:15,780
Odysseus and blessed him with his septor,

648
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,540
smashes him across the back,

649
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:22,440
leaving a welt that could
be seen by the entire army.

650
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,560
And tears came to the eyes of this guy.

651
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:30,420
Are we supposed to feel sorry for
him? Well, the next lines in Homer's,

652
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:33,660
say one soldier popped up and said,

653
00:46:33,661 --> 00:46:38,490
of all the great things Odysseus has
done for us here, that was the greatest

654
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:44,490
to shut up big mouth idiot.
Like their societies.

655
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:49,740
Well, what's their Saudis had
done that was wrong. Of course,

656
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:50,880
uh,

657
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,260
the poet and a and the dishes
didn't like his policy suggestion,

658
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,800
but what he really had them,
he had no right to speak at all.

659
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:04,370
The only people who could speak in the
council or in an assembly where the

660
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:06,600
nobleman,
the boss delays.

661
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,310
So he had crossed the line
in as an ordinary soldier.

662
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:16,610
And to rise and to say anything
was a violation of the culture.

663
00:47:17,281 --> 00:47:20,580
And that's one of the places where you
see whether it's sharp line exists,

664
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,550
they just take orders.

665
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,120
But the gentlemen don't just take orders,

666
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:30,550
they can argue and sometimes
can win the argument.

667
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:36,340
So what you see in this very brief and
inadequate account that I've given you is

668
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,380
that we really,

669
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:43,180
in spite of the fact that we have
bossy lace and even in this case,

670
00:47:43,181 --> 00:47:44,470
uh, uh, [inaudible],

671
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,790
we really don't have a
proper monocryl tradition.

672
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,450
When we think of monarchs single rulers,

673
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:57,610
we think of Hama, Robby and we
think of, uh, the kings of Persia.

674
00:47:57,611 --> 00:48:02,140
And we think of Louis the 14th.
We do not think of what we have here,

675
00:48:02,141 --> 00:48:06,550
which is a bunch of noblemen
who are essentially equal.

676
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:11,710
And the differences between them don't
come from birth or rank as between them,

677
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:15,880
but from wealth and power
that they happen to possess.

678
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:19,390
It is rather not a royal society,

679
00:48:19,391 --> 00:48:23,770
but an heiress to crack society. I
think that's the, the main message.

680
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,200
And it is the matrix

681
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:32,790
of all future political
ideas and arguments in the
Greek world that comes after

682
00:48:34,691 --> 00:48:38,670
this time. I think, yeah,

683
00:48:38,671 --> 00:48:40,840
you need to understand that.
Um,

684
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,710
what the Greeks in the historical period,

685
00:48:44,711 --> 00:48:47,890
once we start having written
records by the Greeks themselves,

686
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,540
the thing that is the,
this is the standard position.

687
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:56,950
What does this thing on the computer,
when you fall back to a position,

688
00:48:56,951 --> 00:48:59,920
what do you call that position?
Huh?

689
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:05,870
Say it again. No, no, no fallback.

690
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:09,490
What does it default? That's right. Good.

691
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:14,520
The default position in a Greek
political theory is aristocracy.

692
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:20,540
That is done normal thing.
Uh,

693
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,250
a good, uh, I've, yes,

694
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:29,260
a very good example of that is what
I've been telling you that that's really

695
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:34,030
what happens. And here's another thing.
If you go to the end of the Greek a story,

696
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,400
uh,
when you think about political theory,

697
00:49:36,401 --> 00:49:40,960
there's Plato and when he lays
out the ideal society in his view,

698
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,520
in the republic,

699
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:48,180
we find there are multiple rulers.

700
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:54,190
And these of course turned out to be the,
uh, the windows of the jeopardy contest.

701
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:55,510
Uh,
playoffs.

702
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:59,350
But it doesn't matter is never one cane.

703
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:04,410
It's always a group of people that the
best government and they will be the best

704
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:10,810
in his case, the defined by chiefly by
their intelligence. But other things too.

705
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:15,400
Uh, well anyway, in this case
in Greek political thinking,

706
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:21,340
the aristocracy of birth
is the default position.

707
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,420
Anybody who wants to argue for a
different kind of political arrangement,

708
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,720
we'll have to make the case
uphill against all tradition.

709
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,020
I hope that you'll have that in the back
of your head when we get to the story

710
00:50:33,021 --> 00:50:38,021
of Athens and the invention of democracy
cause it was off the wall from the

711
00:50:38,571 --> 00:50:42,290
perspective of Greek tradition and
of course anybody from time to time,

712
00:50:42,291 --> 00:50:45,590
they were individuals who thought
that Monica might be a fine thing.

713
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:47,720
They pop,

714
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:52,790
ran against something that was even much,
much more,

715
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:57,920
uh, regarding with much more hostility
by the Greeks when they're through,

716
00:50:57,921 --> 00:50:59,390
you know,
when they've reached their peak.

717
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:04,840
Their notion of monarchy is
something fit for barbarians.

718
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:07,250
But not for Greeks.

719
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:11,210
A free man may not live under a monarchy.

720
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:16,520
And the roots of that I think, uh,
are visible in home brand and passing.

721
00:51:16,521 --> 00:51:19,550
I just want to say that homer,
of course,

722
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:22,620
is the basic text,

723
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:27,630
the basic document for all Greek thinking
in every area that you can imagine

724
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:34,160
throughout the rest of the Greek history.
Over time, it becomes not the only one,

725
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:38,870
but it never ceases to be the best known,
the most influential,

726
00:51:38,871 --> 00:51:43,070
the most powerful. Uh, if it
were a religious document,

727
00:51:43,071 --> 00:51:47,500
primarily we would speak of it
as the Greek Bible, but, uh,

728
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,600
it isn't nonetheless, well, some examples

729
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:54,310
later on in history, uh, somebody,

730
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:58,440
there's a quarrel between Athens and
mega as to who controls the island of

731
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:02,120
Salamis.
They decide to call in an arbitrator.

732
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:06,410
So they call in the Spartans and the
Spartans, Zay, okay, we'll decide.

733
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:11,300
And they decide that it
belongs to athletes. Why? Well,

734
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:15,950
if you look at the catalog of ships in
Homer's Iliad than the island of Sal

735
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:19,220
Amiss had his ships lined up next
to the island of Athens ballgame.

736
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:26,090
It's just you have to
realize how potent this is.

737
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:27,853
Well,

738
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:33,200
let me turn to another aspect
of the story of homer end,

739
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:37,130
how the poems play into a Greek society.

740
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:43,360
I want to talk to you about the ethics
and values that emerge from the reading

741
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:46,010
of the Iliad,
the Odyssey.

742
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:51,740
I mentioned religion and so we
should take a look first at the gods.

743
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:55,780
We are talking, first of
all, I remember about a uh,

744
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:59,750
multimedia t society.

745
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:02,750
Polytheism is what we're talking about.

746
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:08,140
That is true of all of human societies
that we know anything about down to the

747
00:53:12,351 --> 00:53:15,920
earliest possible exception, I suppose.
Well, it depends on what you think.

748
00:53:15,921 --> 00:53:19,820
His earliest, you could say the Hebrews
are the earliest, pure and simple,

749
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,640
but depending on how you
date biblical things,

750
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:28,150
there's an outside chance that an
Egyptian Pharaoh in the 16th century BC,

751
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:35,070
I think, uh, might have claimed
to have some such state.

752
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:37,620
But otherwise there is no such thing.

753
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:43,010
So this is a policy is stick society
with heroic characteristics that is this

754
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:49,050
kind of arrows to cratic outfit,
aristocracy of birth,

755
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:54,320
which is legitimized by heroic
behavior on the battlefield.

756
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:57,061
Now,

757
00:53:57,061 --> 00:54:01,440
one of the things the Greeks believed as
we discover from a poem written by one

758
00:54:01,441 --> 00:54:05,730
of their major poets is
something that so far as I know,

759
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:07,650
unique to the Greeks,

760
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:14,420
they claimed that they were
of the same race as the gods.

761
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,890
And I really don't know of
anybody else who made that claim.

762
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:23,190
Um,
and so they,

763
00:54:23,191 --> 00:54:27,900
you will hear Homeric characters
referred to by epithets. Homer,

764
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:33,200
part of the technique of passing on oral
poetry is by having epithets attached

765
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,450
to the rulers to help with the meter.

766
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,920
Some hero will be called [inaudible],

767
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:45,020
meaning godly God like the old
Trefis reared as a God east.

768
00:54:49,711 --> 00:54:54,630
So theos equal unto a God.
And there are others as well.

769
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:56,280
Now mind you,

770
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:01,280
notice these are not people refer
to as God fearing or lovers of God.

771
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:05,513
No,

772
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:10,550
they are just about equal to the
gods according to these terms.

773
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:17,510
Now that on the one hand is this
extraordinary claim that the Greeks make.

774
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:23,750
They did make amazingly powerful claims
for human beings as opposed to divinity

775
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:30,120
compared to any society that I know.
Anything about.

776
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:35,340
Part of the arrogance that is
characteristic of the ancient Greeks,

777
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:40,050
but at the same time and right away at
the beginning with getting to such a very

778
00:55:40,051 --> 00:55:42,600
Greek thing at Greek characteristic

779
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:49,020
at the same time that he has this
great thing almost like a God.

780
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:54,870
He is also not a god in the
most crucial way possible.

781
00:55:55,590 --> 00:56:00,120
Gods do not die.
Men Die.

782
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:06,080
The mortality of the human being is
a reality and it's of the greatest

783
00:56:08,221 --> 00:56:09,870
significance and importance.

784
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:15,660
And of course men are not as
strong and as powerful as the gods.

785
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:19,860
And indeed as we shall see,
well the tragic view of life,

786
00:56:19,861 --> 00:56:24,861
which the Greeks invent and
which characterizes their
culture is they're right

787
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:28,480
at the beginning in the
Iliad and the Odyssey,

788
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:34,380
it says that at the same time as man is
a remarkable marvel as creature capable

789
00:56:36,401 --> 00:56:38,860
of all sorts of amazing things,

790
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:42,280
even on being almost like the gods.

791
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:48,120
He is nonetheless mortal and dies and
he doesn't have the power that the gods

792
00:56:49,601 --> 00:56:53,800
do. And what do you do about that? Well,

793
00:56:53,801 --> 00:56:57,880
it's interesting I think to compare the
Greek way of dealing with this human

794
00:56:57,881 --> 00:57:01,090
problem that we all have
the problem of death.

795
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:05,740
How do we deal with the
fact that we will die? Well,

796
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:10,240
there's what I like to call the eastern
solution that you find in many an

797
00:57:10,241 --> 00:57:15,241
eastern religion and philosophy that
says that man is in fact nothing.

798
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,230
He is dust,
he is dung.

799
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:22,930
Depending on which story you listened to.

800
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:27,310
So of course you're going to die.
Who Cares?

801
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:31,240
Why should you care?
You are nothing to begin with.

802
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:33,760
You'll be nothing when you're finished.
Relax.

803
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:41,020
Then there is what I would characterize
it as the Christian solution.

804
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,550
You're worried about dying.
You need not die.

805
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:51,570
If you are a good Christian and you do
all the things that you need to do to be

806
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:55,270
a good Christian,
you will not die.

807
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:59,500
You will have personal immortality.

808
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:02,590
So that's how you get around that problem.

809
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:05,860
No need to worry if you're
doing things right. Well,

810
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:10,890
somehow Christians continued to worry and
we have millennia of them killing each

811
00:58:11,021 --> 00:58:15,670
other about how you're supposed to
worry about these things. But, but, uh,

812
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:19,570
but on, if you can accept the
purity of the statement I just made,

813
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:22,330
it's at the root of the thing.
You have a solution.

814
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:27,910
But the Greek tragic view does
not take either of these routes,

815
00:58:27,911 --> 00:58:32,911
which I regard as a relatively easy escape
from the problem compared to the way

816
00:58:34,151 --> 00:58:36,070
the Greeks got stuck.

817
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:42,060
Man is great and they keep
saying so he is important,

818
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:45,250
he is capable of great things.

819
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:48,730
He is of the same race as the gods.

820
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:54,570
And at the same time is life is short
and death is final and death is bad.

821
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:00,820
I ought to say a word about death in order
to comprehend what the Greeks thought.

822
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,880
You know, different people's have
had different ideas about them.

823
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:05,370
Sometimes the notion is,

824
00:59:05,371 --> 00:59:09,370
is it's just terrible for everybody
with actually pain and suffering.

825
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:14,730
And others have a notion of a wonderful
kind of a heaven in which marvelous

826
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:20,230
things happen to you. Sometimes
spiritual, sometimes physical,

827
00:59:20,231 --> 00:59:21,890
depending on the religion.

828
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:23,660
Uh,

829
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:26,760
but for the Greeks,

830
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,960
as I think for a quite a few
other people in the ancient world,

831
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,870
death was nothing

832
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,350
in the board sense of the word.

833
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:42,150
You just went somewhere
and there was nothing,

834
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:46,140
there was darkness,
there was nothing at all.

835
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:52,190
Some few people who had sinned terribly
and earned the wrath of the gods would

836
00:59:53,311 --> 00:59:56,940
indeed be tortured in some
special and typically Greek.

837
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:02,100
Interesting way. Uh,
you remember a Tantalus,

838
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:07,940
he had done a terrible thing and there
he stood forever with his feet in the

839
01:00:08,131 --> 01:00:10,680
water below and above him,

840
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:15,980
a tree with grapes hanging
down and dying of thirst.

841
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:22,140
And every time he went down to try this
sip some of the water, the water receded.

842
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:27,360
And anytime he reached up for the grapes,
the grapes were pulled back.

843
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:32,310
That is a Greek idea of hell.
Well,

844
01:00:32,311 --> 01:00:37,050
you got to keep trying
and you always lose. So,

845
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:41,160
uh, but that's, that's the picture and
the other, you have to realize that

846
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,790
death is a bad thing in the
Elliott. I'm sorry, the Odyssey.

847
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:51,420
Oh,
just use has reason to go down to hades.

848
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:54,930
And while he's down there,

849
01:00:55,980 --> 01:01:00,840
he comes upon Achilles who
has died and he says, well,

850
01:01:00,841 --> 01:01:03,360
it's good to see you achilles.
Say you look fine.

851
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,970
You must really be doing okay down here.

852
01:01:05,971 --> 01:01:10,530
I know that you are a judge
down here and much respected.

853
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:15,630
So it looks like you have beaten the
rat and Achilles says, oh, dishes.

854
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:20,220
Don't say a word to me
about the virtues of death.

855
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:25,440
Better to be a surf,

856
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:32,070
the lowest surf on the earth
than to be a king and hades.

857
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:35,310
Yeah,

858
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:37,290
that's as bad as it can possibly be.

859
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:42,860
The Great Achilles respected still in
the afterworld would immediately turn it

860
01:01:43,081 --> 01:01:46,020
in to be a complete nobody on earth.
So,

861
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:51,090
so it's very important they
faced without any real retreat,

862
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:56,370
the reality and the uh,
the negative character of death,

863
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:02,180
even as they refuse to reject the
significance of life or of mankind.

864
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:07,830
That is what I mean when I speak of the
tragic view and it's very important.

865
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:13,190
Now it seems to me we can eliminate
that a little bit by comparing it with

866
01:02:13,411 --> 01:02:18,411
various modern approaches to
the same sorts of problems.

867
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:23,700
We gotten rid of those problems
yet in spite of modern medicine

868
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:26,670
there we lived still,

869
01:02:26,671 --> 01:02:30,480
I think in what might be called
the age of the enlightenment.

870
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:36,230
That is the dominant sort of
paradigm of what life is all about,

871
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,120
at least in the Western world.

872
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:44,121
And a good deal more of it where the West
has had an influence at the core of it

873
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:48,210
is a belief in progress.

874
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:52,440
Something that was essentially
not present among the Greeks

875
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:59,400
progress in the eyes of the
philosophers of the 18th century.

876
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:03,570
Though they would have been very angry
to hear me say this was something like

877
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:07,200
the equivalent of Christian
hope for immortality.

878
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:11,520
The hope of the Voltaires of this world
was that they could make the world

879
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:13,980
better constantly by their efforts.

880
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:18,000
And this would be rewarded
in a kind of the way,

881
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:23,030
because progress in the future after
they were gone would redound to their

882
01:03:25,531 --> 01:03:28,140
credit for having brought it about me.

883
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:33,150
And that in some sense they would
live on in this society, which had,

884
01:03:33,151 --> 01:03:36,780
they had improved and made a better thing.

885
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:42,140
Another aspect that is very
important in this, uh, sort of, uh,

886
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:44,850
enlightenment approach is individualism.

887
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:50,960
That the core of everything is
the single individual person.

888
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:56,670
As we shall see, this is very
different from the Greeks. Now,

889
01:03:56,671 --> 01:04:01,170
the Greeks were very much concerned with
individualism and this is especially

890
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:04,410
true of the, uh, Democrats in Athens.

891
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:07,830
But even they,
even they,

892
01:04:07,831 --> 01:04:12,831
even their most potent spokesman and
leader placed the goals and achievements

893
01:04:14,251 --> 01:04:19,251
and everything else of an
individual behind something
that they thought was more

894
01:04:19,891 --> 01:04:23,910
important,
which was to community at large,

895
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:28,260
which in historical times was us.
Well,

896
01:04:28,261 --> 01:04:30,810
that's not the way it is
with the modern world.

897
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,570
And that's not the way it
comes out of the enlightenment.

898
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:38,880
The individual is the ultimate,
uh, the enlightenment.

899
01:04:38,881 --> 01:04:41,960
If you go back to its roots
in the 17th century with the,

900
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:45,420
with the likes of Hobbes and Locke,
uh,

901
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:48,420
what is the ultimate place you go to?

902
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:53,070
It is the rights of individuals.

903
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:57,720
You may not stamp out the
rights of individuals.

904
01:04:57,721 --> 01:05:01,950
They are inherent in everything.
Either you believe,

905
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:06,890
as our founding fathers said that
they were, we were in doubt, uh,

906
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,380
bought with them by our creator.

907
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,530
They didn't say God because of
course the enlightenment thinkers,

908
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:15,540
we're not so sure they believed in God,

909
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:19,620
but they still seem to
believe in something they
wanted to call a creator. Um,

910
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:22,930
so or if you didn't believe in God,

911
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,960
this was just a natural right nature
gave each individual the right to life,

912
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:32,230
liberty property,

913
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:36,940
and nobody could take
these away legitimately.

914
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:38,343
Well,

915
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:43,740
the Greeks had no concept of natural
rights or of rights that human beings were

916
01:05:45,071 --> 01:05:46,570
given by the gods.

917
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:50,110
That is a very important difference.

918
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:56,520
That was you had to act in such a way
as to make life possible and decent.

919
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:03,070
And for the Greeks, that always meant
being part of a decent community,

920
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:07,900
the polls, but the modern world to get
back to that, to this enlightenment world,

921
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,860
individualism and a key
aspect to that as hedonism.

922
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:17,310
That is to say it is legitimate
and proper to search for pleasure,

923
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:22,650
for each individual to attempt
to please himself however he can.

924
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:26,410
And it turns out that there,
if you could take it to our own day,

925
01:06:26,411 --> 01:06:31,270
there are no limits, pretty much
to what he can do to gain pleasure.

926
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:37,810
I would argue that there is a direct
line from the enlightenment philosophy to

927
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:38,710
nihilism.

928
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:44,460
That is to say a philosophy that says
there are no limits to what human beings

929
01:06:46,450 --> 01:06:47,283
may do.

930
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:53,010
What turns out to be the practical fact
is that he who has the power and the

931
01:06:54,671 --> 01:06:59,080
will to do what he wants,
we'll be able to do so.

932
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:04,440
And he who has not will be
forced to suffer whatever
the powerful impose on him.

933
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:09,370
And this is seen by the original
nihilist as a good thing.

934
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:14,650
Uh, what's his name? Uh, nature
of course said some of us are,

935
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:15,850
are better than others.

936
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:20,500
Some of us are super men and it's quite
wrong and wicked for us to be treated as

937
01:07:20,501 --> 01:07:24,850
though we were ordinary fellows and
therefore do not tie us down with these

938
01:07:24,851 --> 01:07:29,560
ridiculous codes of ethics and morals
and other things which are simply the

939
01:07:29,561 --> 01:07:33,850
weapons by which the week hold down the
strong. This was an interesting idea,

940
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:37,300
but it wasn't noon. There's a Greek in
the fifth century. He says the same thing.

941
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:39,203
Um,

942
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:44,380
there is no definition of
goodness for this modern approach.

943
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:48,940
No definition of happiness.
Each individual decides sore himself.

944
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:50,770
What is good,
what has happened?

945
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:56,970
What it really does does is to evade
the question that I'm talking about.

946
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:01,360
Is this all okay?
If we're all going to die,

947
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:06,250
then does it really mean that we should
just do the best we can at anybody's

948
01:08:06,251 --> 01:08:09,820
expense while we're alive?
Is that a satisfactory outcome?

949
01:08:09,821 --> 01:08:14,200
Will we indeed be happier, better
off while we're alive? If we do that,

950
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:17,930
the Greeks would have
that is stupid and absurd.

951
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:21,410
If you think for 10 seconds,
you realize that's no good.

952
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:25,371
Now,

953
01:08:25,371 --> 01:08:30,371
the Greeks on the other
hand had a powerful belief
in the dominance of chance.

954
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:36,200
They accepted what I again,

955
01:08:36,201 --> 01:08:40,220
is a very modern idea now that in fact,

956
01:08:40,221 --> 01:08:45,221
there is no divine force or divine forces
who oversee what happens to mankind on

957
01:08:45,891 --> 01:08:46,724
earth.

958
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:52,120
But rather things happen simply
in a random way according
to no particular rule.

959
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,720
Uh,
and that's the way it is.

960
01:08:57,020 --> 01:09:02,020
It is not virtue or merit that
determine the quality of your life.

961
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:06,800
It is chance. And, uh,

962
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:10,990
there were several places in the
Iliad and the odyssey that, um,

963
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:12,980
emphasize that point

964
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:17,990
well that leaves the Greeks with this,

965
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:22,991
something like this question in the light
of human mortality to disinterest of

966
01:09:24,681 --> 01:09:27,710
the Gods,
the chances of life,

967
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:33,190
what can man do to achieve happiness
and immortality because he still doesn't

968
01:09:35,661 --> 01:09:37,970
feel happy about his mortality.

969
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:41,180
Though he accepts that this is a problem.

970
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:44,750
It's something that he
still hankers after.

971
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:49,870
It's inevitable that people should and
part of the answer is very Homeric.

972
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:55,760
It is the heroic ethic at a certain place.

973
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:59,060
I think a couple of places in the Elliot,
uh,

974
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:02,760
Achilles tells us,
ask why,

975
01:10:02,761 --> 01:10:06,220
why did you come here
to uh, to uh, fight? Uh,

976
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:08,260
Troy we are told,
we know the,

977
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:13,310
the legend says Achilles was told before
he came that if he did not go to Troy

978
01:10:14,121 --> 01:10:18,110
and fight in that war,
he, because his, uh,

979
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:22,610
his mother was a goddess,
he had partial divinity in him.

980
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:27,350
He, uh, would be immortal.
He would never die.

981
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:31,880
But on the other hand,
he would not be great and famous.

982
01:10:31,881 --> 01:10:35,360
His memory would not be carried
forward into the future.

983
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:38,090
If he went to Troy,
he would die.

984
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:44,230
But his memory as the greatest of
the Akins would be immortal forever.

985
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:49,580
Well, you know, the choice he took and
you know that it turned out to be right.

986
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:54,830
We still know about Achilles don't
mean, and when, when we were all gone,

987
01:10:54,831 --> 01:10:56,150
people will know about Achilles.

988
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:59,690
So we should take the Greeks
very seriously on that score.

989
01:11:01,730 --> 01:11:04,560
Well anyway, sometimes
he's asked, uh, what?

990
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:08,390
What made you come here in spite
of that? And his answer was, well,

991
01:11:08,391 --> 01:11:13,040
when my father sent me here, he told me
a number of things that I'm supposed to.

992
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:17,250
But the most important of
these was the Greek words.

993
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:19,110
I ain our risk.

994
01:11:19,111 --> 01:11:23,280
Stay away always be the best.

995
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:29,190
The best doesn't mean morally the
best in anything. Like our sense,

996
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:33,900
it means the greatest,
the strongest, the ablest,

997
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:38,430
the most admired. That is
what you want to be. Well,

998
01:11:38,431 --> 01:11:41,610
you can only do that if
you are in a contest.

999
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,280
You can only be the best
if somebody is not as good.

1000
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:49,790
And the Greek word for that kind
of a contest is a Goan AGLN.

1001
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,640
And so it's fair to
think about the Greeks.

1002
01:11:53,641 --> 01:11:58,230
I think it's very necessary to think
about the Greeks as having a particular at

1003
01:11:58,231 --> 01:11:59,850
Gono society,

1004
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:05,510
a society filled with competition
in which if not everybody,

1005
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:11,990
lots and lots of people are constantly
striving to be the very best,

1006
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:17,220
whatever the definition of best
is in the context that's relevant.

1007
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:21,540
Now,
I guess I'm out of time,

1008
01:12:21,541 --> 01:12:26,280
so I'll pick up the story next time it
with the story about this heroic ethic

1009
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,620
and the impact that it
has improved society.
