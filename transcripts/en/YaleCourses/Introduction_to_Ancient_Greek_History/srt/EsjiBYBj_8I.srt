1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,210
Let me remind you that the,
uh,

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,060
the Spartans ever since their victory
and the Peloponnesian war had been,

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,020
uh,

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:17,020
attempting to extend their head Gemini
at first all the way over into Asia.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,030
And then when that was sorted,

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,170
they tried to do so on
the mainland of Greece.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,930
And,
uh,

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:32,030
one consequence of their effort and the
failure to achieve in an easy way was

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,110
the restoration of Athens to a
primary position in the Greek world.

10
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:43,350
Again,
not as powerful as Sparta,

11
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:48,351
but once again an independent state
that was a capable of being a serious

12
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:50,940
opponent of the Spartans.

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,960
And today I wanna talk about the
emergence of a third great power in this

14
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,570
period,
which had never had a position,

15
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:04,640
I think of,
um,

16
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,440
something resembling equality with
the leading powers in the Greek world.

17
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:13,680
Although it had had periods
when it was very strong. Anyway,

18
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:19,230
teams is what I'm talking about now.
You start,

19
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,260
if you look at the situation in three
79 when the Spartans were in control of

20
00:01:28,651 --> 00:01:33,480
thieves as a consequence of
the actions of a fever gas,

21
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,380
there was a spot in garrison there
in the city on its Acropolis.

22
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:42,370
There were spartan garrisons
in other towns in be Osha.

23
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,860
And that was probably as low a point for
the feed bins as they had experienced

24
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,000
since the four fifties when the
Athenians gained control of the Osha.

25
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,460
But starting with the
successful Sieben rebellion,

26
00:01:56,461 --> 00:02:00,360
which overthrew the spartan
command of the city,

27
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:06,050
the Thebesians launched a period of growth
in power influence a wealth and even

28
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:13,980
to some degree extent,
which justifies a modern historians.

29
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:16,950
And speaking about a period,

30
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:21,951
perhaps beginning in three 71 and running
at least a decade to which they give

31
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:25,500
the name,
the Sieben hegemony.

32
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,040
And today I want to talk about how that
happened and how it sort of developed

33
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:34,410
and ended. Well, not, not
ended, not today. Yeah.

34
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:38,290
I guess I will be talking
about how in a day, right? Um,

35
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:44,330
the Spartans invaded after the
Athenian overthrow of spartan rule.

36
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,330
And in the first year,

37
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,030
the lead in that invasion
was given to, uh, uh, I,

38
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,040
the young king Cleon Burtis not to
adjust the layers and his failure to

39
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:03,231
undertake that command a exercise the
minds of ancient writers as well as modern

40
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:05,344
ones.

41
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,590
One answer whenever adjusts the latest
doesn't take command of an army,

42
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,730
which is following a policy that he likes.

43
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,450
People suggest that he might've been
physically incapable of doing it.

44
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,710
He was an old man and he was,
he had been injured.

45
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,820
And so there's a,
that's a plausible reason that any time,

46
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,140
and yet the ancient writers were persuaded
that there were times when he was

47
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:37,141
simply playing politics in
some complicated way and
choosing not to take the

48
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:39,200
command.

49
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,470
And this is one of those occasions when
they speculate that he was trying to get

50
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:47,830
clean on bridges,
engaged in this anti and policy,

51
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:53,610
which would provide for greater support
for that general [inaudible] in policy.

52
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,960
And that that's why he had worked it
so that [inaudible] has got to command.

53
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,150
We simply can't be sure about
what the truth of that is.

54
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,630
Clay Ombre does, however,
it did not a wage,

55
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,660
a very aggressive campaign and that a
first invasion of three 78 produced very,

56
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:21,040
very little. However,
subsequent Spartan Invasions.

57
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,120
Also,
even those led by just laze,

58
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,430
we're not successful.

59
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,440
The [inaudible] were able to
gradually to gather their strength to,

60
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:34,300
uh,
recover parts of,

61
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:39,301
be Osha and bring them under their power
and to drive the Spartans away without

62
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,290
yielding anything of importance.

63
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,710
One of the consequences, I'm talking
really about the years, three 88,

64
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:52,570
three three 73 77,

65
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:55,900
three 76 and into three 75.

66
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,630
One of the things that the, uh,
Steven's engaged in in this period,

67
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:05,170
and it's extremely important because it
provides the basis for the power that

68
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:09,940
they will develop was a
reconstruction of the B Ocean League.

69
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,890
The Thebans had commanded or led or
dominated the be ocean league before they

70
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:21,700
changed its constitution.
However, in these years,

71
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,160
in a way that was a rather important,

72
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,510
it w what the in word it
to simplify the matter,

73
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:34,530
the entire operation of the
Lee became more democratic.

74
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,950
They used to have the decisive bodies
that determine Sieben policy in the form

75
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:45,730
of four separate, um, councils,

76
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,860
which were sort of in direct
regimes that really made the policy,

77
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,490
the new constitution made the decisive
place really an assembly in which all the

78
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:03,550
representatives of the
urban cities came and, uh,

79
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,210
made policy in an assembly,
not in separate councils,

80
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:13,211
all of which could be more readily
controlled by oligarchic figures.

81
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,773
And,
uh,

82
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,870
the only thing is that the meetings of
the B Ocean League took place in thieves.

83
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,790
Now, not only did Thebes have a majority
of representatives in that league by,

84
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,110
or at least the largest number by
virtue of its size and its leading role,

85
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:35,470
but the fact that it all took place in
Thebes meant that there would be more

86
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,120
thebesians there.

87
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,450
And I'm Moore Stephens playing an
influential role in what was going on.

88
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,973
Nonetheless,

89
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:48,050
we shouldn't discount the truly
democratic nature of this regime.

90
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:52,890
It's a new thing. Be Osha and
Thebes used to be a bulwark of our,

91
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:57,970
of a oligarchy and it became
a remarkably democratic city.

92
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,363
And,
uh,

93
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,060
I think there's reason to take note of
the fact that this seemed to have had an

94
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:12,881
impact on thieves and be Osha much
like the one that Heraclitus praises so

95
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:18,530
highly, uh, back when
Athens became democratic,

96
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:23,531
when they threw out the tyrants and
established the Cli Senek regime,

97
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,800
Heraclitus says they
became better warriors,

98
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:29,330
they produced a better army.

99
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,140
They'd began to feeding their
enemies as they had not done before.

100
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:38,890
I think that is very clearly also what
happens in themes that we can't get away

101
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:44,951
from the fact that seems became a more
formidable military power thereafter.

102
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,110
Whether or not it's linked to
democracy is open to argument,

103
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:52,280
but I think there is a real argument
that would say it worked that way.

104
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,390
At least we don't know the
details of this very well,

105
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:59,540
but a very unusual thing
seems to have happened.

106
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,990
The Thebus ultimately were able to
increase the size of their army by using

107
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:11,380
farmers who would not ordinarily have
been able to afford hoplite equipment.

108
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,200
But somehow the state managed
to equip poorer farmers and to,

109
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:17,990
uh,

110
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,990
turn them into hoplites so that ultimately
the army that Thebes commanded when

111
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:25,790
you get down to the,

112
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:30,020
a years after the battle of Luke Tra
in which the Thebans and their friends

113
00:08:30,021 --> 00:08:34,420
defeated the Spartans,
you will see that, uh,

114
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:39,730
really a huge army by Greek standards
goes marching into the Peloponnesus of

115
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:45,011
which a large proportion was this Steven
hoplite group that was a much more

116
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,190
potent because of its size.

117
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:54,190
And it could be argued because of the
spirit of these new newly hoplite in the

118
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,920
Democrats, you might say, well,

119
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,710
as the Thebans were
developing this league,

120
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:06,711
they were also fighting the Spartans
and gradually driving the Spartans back.

121
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:11,020
For instance, the, uh, uh,

122
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,250
they destroyed the city of Plataea,

123
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,240
which was always on the side of the
enemies of thieves. In this case,

124
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:22,020
they were on the side of
the Spartans and, uh, uh,

125
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,260
it would take a while
before that was undone.

126
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:30,290
They also placed a number of
cities under thieving command.

127
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,760
They didn't need to do that for most
of the cities in be Osha because mostly

128
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:39,930
they were, they seem to be satisfied
and pleased to cooperate with the thing.

129
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,820
I why not?
I mean,

130
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:43,590
I should make the point clear as to
why they would be happy to do that.

131
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,640
When the Spartans invaded be Osha. They
didn't only beat up Thebes. In fact,

132
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:52,641
Thebes was less hurt than were the other
towns because seeds was further away

133
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:55,980
and better equipped to defend itself.
Every time the Spartans came in,

134
00:09:55,981 --> 00:10:00,450
they ravage to be ocean countryside
and did harm to these be ocean town.

135
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:03,180
So it was thieves that was the defender,

136
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:07,380
the protector of the bee oceans against
the Spartans in this certainly gave them

137
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:08,220
popularity.

138
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:13,610
It helps explain why this new B ocean
confederation was so effective and so

139
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:17,220
loyal.
The Thebans,

140
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:22,221
we're doing a key job for be
Osha and to be oceans and this,

141
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:28,110
uh, meanwhile this new army
that was being put together,

142
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,000
I wasn't of course entirely new.

143
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:34,980
It's heart would have been the
old B ocean hoplite farmer, uh,

144
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:38,580
group. But it was added to and
it was given this new twist,

145
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,480
I think really a combination
twist of two kinds of, uh,

146
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,460
elements that explain
a kind of enthusiasm,

147
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:51,750
a kind of morale boost
that they had. One was, uh,

148
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,050
a greater sense of what
we would call nationalism.

149
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:57,750
It's obviously an acronystic
for the city states,

150
00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:02,580
but we don't have a better word for it.
That is to say this constant warfare,

151
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:07,581
these constant attacks by the Spartans
culminating in this seizure of their city

152
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,050
against all,
uh,

153
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,990
custom against all law and very
unpleasant way and the support of these

154
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:19,170
oligarchs as against the common
people in the ordinary folks.

155
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,130
So that when the,
this new regime led,

156
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,160
I should point out by these
two extraordinary military
leaders Palapa das and

157
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:29,843
anonymous.

158
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,680
When these fellows also were
responsible for the liberation of feeds,

159
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:39,681
especially Palapa Daz and when they were
leading the fight for the defense of

160
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:41,610
Biasha,

161
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,560
all of that meant that there was a
growing feeling of we are be oceans,

162
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:51,561
we are together and the enemy is the
Spartans and we need to fight them,

163
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,600
uh, to with that. If you
throw in the feeling that, um,

164
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,360
democracy appears to
have in its first burst,

165
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,710
especially I should point out that,
uh,

166
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:09,930
the Athenian extraordinary success on
land occurs right after the democratic

167
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:15,370
revolution of Kleist and knees.
I don't say they become bad thereafter,

168
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:20,350
but they're never again
quite as extraordinary as a
land force as they are then.

169
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:25,730
And analogy that's often drawn is with
the armies of the French Revolution in

170
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,430
the 18th century,

171
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,700
which really were fantastically successful
right after the revolution began.

172
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:40,141
And they began enrolling
in deed conscripting great
numbers of people who would

173
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:44,950
never have been in the army before,
uh, on, in the name of the nation,

174
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,900
in the name of freedom, in the name
of all kinds of lovely things. Again,

175
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:54,901
that's often neglected that the French
already had a terrific army before that

176
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:59,710
happened and they had wonderful officers
and generals and was skilled in the art

177
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:00,070
of war.

178
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:05,070
So it was a kind of a best of all
worlds where they had a solid base for

179
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,520
military superiority to which
was added this great group.

180
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:16,270
There's great business of numbers
and the zeal that went with it,

181
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:21,570
something like that I believe is going
on here in the three seventies to help

182
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:24,550
explain what's happening to the,

183
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,570
what becomes is enormously powerful
and successful theme and army.

184
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,263
Um,

185
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,710
the fighting goes on the feed bins,

186
00:13:35,711 --> 00:13:40,711
you remembered joined with the Athenians
against the Spartans back at the time

187
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:46,261
of the foundation of the Second Athenian
confederacy and three 77 and they do

188
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,510
work together for a time,

189
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:54,511
but it doesn't take very long for there
to grow up differences between the

190
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,270
Athenians and the be oceans.
They are,

191
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:03,271
if you look back at the whole history
more frequently enemies than they are

192
00:14:03,491 --> 00:14:08,290
friends. They are longstanding
differences, suspicions,

193
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,230
attitudes that are not
entirely friendly and so on.

194
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,640
And as Stephen Power grows and as
the threat from Sparta diminishes,

195
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:24,210
the Athenians become less enthusiastic
about their alliance with thieves because

196
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:29,431
the Thebans are now emerging as a
contender for the leading position for

197
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,900
[inaudible] position in Greece.

198
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,080
So we will see the Athenians and
the FIBA gradually moving apart.

199
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,110
In the decade of the three seventies,

200
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,760
there was in three 75 a proposal for
peace to be established in the warring

201
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,100
Greek world.

202
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:57,920
It was apparently there's some
difference of opinion among our sources.

203
00:14:57,921 --> 00:15:02,660
But one thing that seems clear,
the King of Persia was in favor of it.

204
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,250
The ancient writers explain
his reason for doing that,

205
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,130
for being interested in
having that happen. Uh,

206
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,120
because he had other wars to
fight as so often was the case.

207
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:17,960
There was a rebellion in Egypt,
which was always a serious menace.

208
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:23,230
So he wanted peace so that he could hire
Greek mercenaries to fight in his army.

209
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,950
Perhaps that wasn't the only
reason that the great king had. Um,

210
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:34,060
he must have been worried at the growth
of Athenian power and influence at sea,

211
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,020
which was continuing
throughout this period.

212
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,110
The second Athenian Confederacy.

213
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,230
Never had the power and the extent that
the great empire had had in the fifth

214
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:46,400
century,
but it,

215
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:51,230
it was scary from the standpoint of the
great king and so he might very well

216
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:56,231
have wanted to restore peace to Greece
as a way of stopping excuses for further

217
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,330
expansion on the part of the Athenians.
On the other hand,

218
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:07,690
the Athenians were not unhappy to make
peace as an opportunity to consolidate

219
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:13,010
the gains that they had had and because
that would put a stop to what I think

220
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:16,910
was beginning to worry them.
The expansion of Thebes and mind you,

221
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,100
they're still worried.

222
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:24,101
Number one about Sparta in three 75
Spartans haven't been defeated by anybody.

223
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,200
That's still the most serious power and
there's still the power that stands for

224
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:32,300
Persian,
a power in the Greek world,

225
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,100
but things have become more complicated
as thieves as emerged on the scene.

226
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,400
Well,
the ancient right,

227
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:44,330
a diet doors especially
speaks of an event.

228
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,270
Well,
let me describe the event.

229
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,440
He says that when it was time
to sign this common piece,

230
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,920
maybe I just want to say a word about that
too. The Greek words for common piece,

231
00:16:57,921 --> 00:17:00,230
our coin ne a rain a,

232
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:05,590
it is a term that comes up again and
again in the fourth century in attempting

233
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:11,930
to bring a peace agreements among the
Greek states. It's, it's a new thing.

234
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,611
As you know,

235
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:18,611
piece in the past usually took the form
of the swearing of odes to accept a

236
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:24,431
peace treaty on very specific terms
between competence in that war.

237
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:30,530
The coin, a Renae concept has a more
modern ring to it and it's, it's,

238
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:31,190
uh,

239
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:36,190
seems to have the idea that there should
be a common peace among all the Greeks

240
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:42,100
and that the signatories
should be responsible for
upholding that common piece.

241
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,223
Um,

242
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,230
it's a very interesting idea and it
sparked enormous interest in scholars,

243
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,821
I think,

244
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:55,821
especially after the first world war
when all of the helpful talk about the

245
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,300
League of Nations and [inaudible] picture
of perpetual peace and all of that

246
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:03,840
stuff was flying around
in certain circles.

247
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,800
So people hope to see in the coin a rainy,
this might have been a,

248
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:13,740
uh, a preliminary sign of
that same kind of idea,

249
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:20,420
but it didn't work any better in the
ancient world than it has worked in the,

250
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:22,470
uh,
in the modern world.

251
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:28,560
To get back to the first suggestion
in three 75 about having such a thing,

252
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,760
these states were agreed to do it.

253
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:38,420
And then in the trouble came when thieves
insisted that just as the Spartans

254
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:45,231
could sign on behalf of all of their
allies for the Peloponnesian League,

255
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
the Thebans wanted the right to sign for
all of their B ocean allies on behalf

256
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,390
of the ocean leak.

257
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:59,390
It would have been the de
facto recognition of the
ocean league with thieves as

258
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:01,920
its leader.
Uh,

259
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,100
this is really what happens if you put
your minds back to four 45 in the 30

260
00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:12,030
years piece that concluded what we call
the first Peloponnesian war. When the A,

261
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:17,031
a spartan is allow the Athenians to sign
and speak for all the members of its

262
00:19:17,191 --> 00:19:21,480
league. They were giving de facto
recognition and regarding the Greeks,

263
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,160
the Athenians as their equals.

264
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:27,120
This was something that the Spartans,

265
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:31,050
no doubt a lid chiefly in this view,

266
00:19:31,051 --> 00:19:35,640
by adjust the latest, they were not
going to let the feed bins do it.

267
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,313
In fact,

268
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,380
we are told in a very bold action adjusts
to lay is struck the feed bins from

269
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,190
the lists.

270
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,520
The list of those who had taken her word
would take part in the piece because

271
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:53,100
they insisted on this cloth.
Now there's a problem about this.

272
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:58,790
The same story almost identically is
told in three 71 when we come to the

273
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:06,450
attempt at another coin, a rainy, uh, to,

274
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,640
to bring peace to the general Greek world.

275
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:12,900
The whole story is told in this pretty
much the same way and the upshot of the

276
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:16,620
one in three 71 will be the
great battle of loop truck.

277
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,470
This has led some scholars
to say diet doors.

278
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:23,640
Who is the source of these
tales simply has screwed up.

279
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,940
It's got it wrong.
This is what they call a doublet.

280
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:30,180
Somehow he projected backwards.

281
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,290
An event that really happened in
[inaudible] 71 and has it happened twice?

282
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,580
I'm very,

283
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:40,020
very suspicious about modern historians
who were prepared to rip up pieces of

284
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:43,910
ancient historians because we know better
and it just doesn't make any sense as

285
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,010
the argument. The truth is, I can see
no reason why they shouldn't have twice.

286
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,340
Certainly adjust. Uh, what's his name, uh,

287
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,860
at Pamet on this would
have insisted on that.

288
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,150
Certainly the Spartans would
have objected to it. Uh,

289
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:02,250
the actions that go with it strike me
as being perfectly okay in three 75 and

290
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:06,470
win four years later.
A similar circumstance emerges.

291
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:11,050
Why shouldn't the same thing happened
again, I haven't really looked into this,

292
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:14,610
but I can imagine if you look through
the whole Cold War history, uh,

293
00:21:14,611 --> 00:21:17,640
I'm sure you'll find many things that
are happening over and over again and

294
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,770
exactly the same way because the
circumstances haven't changed.

295
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,350
So with my characteristic Gullibility,

296
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,400
I believe in the story as
it is told in three 75,

297
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:34,030
well fighting resumed since the
piece really didn't hold and the,

298
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:34,420
uh,

299
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:39,420
the Thebans continue and the be oceans
in general continue to successfully fight

300
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,880
off the Spartans. I should have
mentioned in the course of this fighting.

301
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,860
Soon after the uh,
treaty,

302
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:52,300
there's an amazing occasion which
has Harbinger's for the future.

303
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:57,160
A Spartan army is
marching in one direction.

304
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,160
A theme and army is marching
in another direction.

305
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:05,230
The Spartans out number. The
theme runs very greatly. In fact,

306
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:10,231
the Thevenin whole Sieben force is simply
the 300 men who had been formed pretty

307
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:16,081
recently into a special elite
fighting corps called the sacred band.

308
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:23,590
They're special quality was that in
addition to being excellent warriors and a

309
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,980
trained specially for their job,

310
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:32,250
they were a homosexual lovers who stood
and fought right next to each other.

311
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:38,430
This was a just carrying
forward the principle that
the Spartans had used in one

312
00:22:38,621 --> 00:22:42,700
way and another, and it turned
out to be equally successful.

313
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:48,270
This sacred man was a tremendous fighting
force and will play a critical role in

314
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:52,900
the important battle of Luke Tra.
Anyway,

315
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,960
they managed to defeat in hoplite battle
a spartan forest that is greater than

316
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:05,260
they are. It's not a real hundred
percent happy hoplite battle.

317
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,480
The numbers.
There are only 300 feed bins.

318
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,320
Even as about a thousand a Spartans.

319
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:15,190
It's the way of battle is fought,
is not traditional and typical.

320
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:16,240
It's a little peculiar.

321
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:21,280
So you really can't regard
it as the decisive time.

322
00:23:21,281 --> 00:23:25,840
Somebody beat a spartan hoplite Phalanx
and battle that we'll have to wait till

323
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,820
Luke trip. On the other hand, it,

324
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,260
the evidence of the ancients is that
it really impressed the Greek world in

325
00:23:32,261 --> 00:23:32,920
general.

326
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,920
Even this form of a victory over a
spartan hoplites was unprecedented and it

327
00:23:39,371 --> 00:23:39,821
really,

328
00:23:39,821 --> 00:23:44,410
I think a kind of shook some people in
terms of their confidence at the Spartans

329
00:23:44,411 --> 00:23:46,700
would always win a battle like that.

330
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:52,550
So the fighting goes on on all the
fronts that I have mentioned to you until

331
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:57,551
finally we get down to three 71 and
in three 71 the same thing happens.

332
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,740
There is a pressure from the
Persians for a general piece.

333
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:08,010
The Athenians are not against that idea,
uh,

334
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,280
but the same tale I told you last time,

335
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,610
there's no question that had happened
that Luke Trin, nobody doubts that.

336
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:19,270
And the result was a renewal of the
war with the Spartans taking the lead

337
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:28,390
aggressively moving into be Osha
as they had done every time before.

338
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:35,650
I think it's very worth mentioning that
we don't have any case up to now up to

339
00:24:35,961 --> 00:24:40,961
three 71 in which to be oceans and
their friends and allies marching to the

340
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,460
Peloponnesus. All the attacking has
been by the Spartans into the Osha,

341
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,360
which means these wars have
always been costly to be Osha,

342
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:54,140
but not to Sparta.
And we'll see that the,

343
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:58,940
one of the things that [inaudible] does,
wants to do when he can is to,

344
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,270
um,
reverse that situation.

345
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,460
So this brings us to
the battle of Luke Tra.

346
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:12,490
Luke Tra is a town in
southwestern be Osha,

347
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,700
the two armies march towards each other
and there's a lot of maneuvering this

348
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:20,240
way in that way.

349
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:25,130
But finally they come on to
this rather small field. If you,

350
00:25:25,131 --> 00:25:27,820
uh,
you can go there today and look at it,

351
00:25:27,821 --> 00:25:32,821
it's really pretty easy to s to place
the ancient story into the modern,

352
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:37,050
uh, geography. Uh, each,

353
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,880
there's a plane between two hills,

354
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:42,890
went to the south and one to the north.

355
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,210
The ocean army took up its
position on the northern hill.

356
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:52,190
The Spartans took up there is on
the southern hill. Uh, and then, uh,

357
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,160
finally when the day life came,

358
00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:00,530
they moved forward and fought each
other in this field, which is sort of,

359
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:01,251
it's,

360
00:26:01,251 --> 00:26:05,540
it's plenty big enough for any kind of
hoplite battle that you want to have.

361
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:08,120
But some scholars have wanted to make a,

362
00:26:08,121 --> 00:26:11,000
to explain the battle in
terms of a limited space,

363
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,730
but I think that really isn't an issue.

364
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:18,200
This is a sort of a typical spark
as typical hoplite battle field.

365
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:24,260
So can we Burdis marches on themes again,

366
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,440
it's not adjust the,
and I mean,

367
00:26:27,441 --> 00:26:31,790
this looks like the culmination of adjusts
the laces. Antifreeze urban policy.

368
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:36,050
He's not there again, the ancient
writers and modern scholars, uh,

369
00:26:36,051 --> 00:26:39,740
wonder why he wasn't there. I'm
prepared to take the simple minded view.

370
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,020
If he wasn't there,
he couldn't have been there.

371
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:47,290
He must've been out of action for physical
reasons because I can't imagine any

372
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:51,630
good reason why he wouldn't want to
be there for the payoff here. Anyway,

373
00:26:51,631 --> 00:26:56,631
there was something in the neighborhood
of 10,000 Spartan hoplites and maybe a

374
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,010
thousand calvary.

375
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:03,300
And it's the sport that could
be ocean side is less clear,

376
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,430
maybe, maybe six, maybe
7,000 B ocean hoplites.

377
00:27:08,431 --> 00:27:10,320
So they are outnumbered.

378
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:15,321
And I think that has a lot to do with
the tactics that he and on employs in

379
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,360
fighting this battle. It's a famous
battle. It's an important battle.

380
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:26,570
So I'll take a few moments to
talk about the battle itself.

381
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,840
Again,
this is a much debated,

382
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:34,710
it's not easy to know what's
going on or why it's going on,

383
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:41,070
but let's start with the important point
that the [inaudible] were outnumbered.

384
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:47,390
So it really was up to a Pam [inaudible]
to think of some way to overcome this

385
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,170
disadvantage.
Normal course of events,

386
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,270
six or 7,000 against 10,000
in irregular hoplite battle.

387
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:01,230
You can, the bookies would
take the game off the board.

388
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:04,980
I mean the, especially if they're
Spartans and palpitations,

389
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:09,150
the, uh, the bigger, the bigger
battalions are going to win.

390
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,090
So a feminine,

391
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,780
this comes up with certainly to s nobody
can deny that he came up with some kind

392
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:17,130
of plan.
What am I fussing about here?

393
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:22,700
Some scholars have wanted to
emphasize not the tactics of,

394
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,830
of Pamela Honda's,

395
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:29,060
but rather this superior fighting
qualities of this new fiebing democratic

396
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,730
national army. Well, I certainly
think that made a difference.

397
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,760
I give real credit to that element and
yet I can't escape thinking that there

398
00:28:41,131 --> 00:28:42,750
really was a very tricky,

399
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:47,810
unusual strategy or tactics or operational
plan used by a patent on this that,

400
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:51,040
uh,

401
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,590
accounts in a considerable part for the
success of the seabirds in this battle.

402
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,810
He lined,
the normal way you line up is that the,

403
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:03,390
the sort of the leading forces on each
side take up the right wing of their

404
00:29:03,391 --> 00:29:05,670
Phalanx.
That's the position of honor.

405
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:10,500
And that's where you try to beat the
other guy that has the consequences

406
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:14,670
incidentally, of meaning that the best
army doesn't fight against the best army.

407
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,231
In each case,

408
00:29:16,231 --> 00:29:20,340
the best army is fighting against
a weaker portion of the enemy army.

409
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:23,010
That's not what Apam it on.
This wanted,

410
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:28,011
he put his fiebing forces with the 300 a
sacred band members at the front of it.

411
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,290
He, his, uh,

412
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,360
his own group was at the left side of
the B ocean line facing the Spartans

413
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,510
directly.
Now

414
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:47,590
the Spartans

415
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,780
had to realize when they saw what
was going on, oh, it, forgive me,

416
00:29:52,781 --> 00:29:54,460
I forgot to tell you another
very important thing.

417
00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:00,430
Instead of the usual depth
of the Phalanx, eight, 12,

418
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,460
maybe 16, ranks, uh,

419
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:08,260
Pam and don does loaded
his left wing 50 men deep.

420
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,210
And that is, it may be
precedented, but if so,

421
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:16,000
it's extremely rare in the past,

422
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:20,890
his idea apparently.
And then when he started for battle,

423
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:26,550
he took his left wing and moved it
over bleakly further to the left,

424
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:32,310
the plan being to flank the Spartans if
they could and come at them from their

425
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:37,440
vulnerable side and to, uh, uh,

426
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,450
do so in Turin,
tremendous strength.

427
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:46,230
I think the idea of the tremendous
strength in depth was to win on that side

428
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,680
quickly because he was weak
obviously on his right.

429
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:59,230
I suppose that the force
immediately after the Siemens,

430
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:04,540
what itself presents a problem because
if the feed bins went sharply to the left

431
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:08,110
on this occasion with their
deep powerful Phalanx,

432
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:14,310
the guys next to them probably would move
with them to some degree but not with

433
00:31:15,611 --> 00:31:19,250
the same speed and not at the same
determination because their situation,

434
00:31:19,251 --> 00:31:22,120
so there was the danger of there
being an opening right there.

435
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,320
That would have been very scary.

436
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,550
Apparently a Ananda monotonous
told the people on the right.

437
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:32,880
I would have thought everybody to the
right of his outfit to proceed only very

438
00:31:35,411 --> 00:31:38,560
slowly.
If that's the case,

439
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:40,510
the Spartans then on the,

440
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:45,540
the pep help Aneesh and army on their
left would have had to take some time

441
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,240
before they could encounter the B ocean
army so that the first fighting would be

442
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:54,890
on the left.
We're at Pam on this,

443
00:31:54,891 --> 00:31:58,600
wanted it and his hope was,
in a way,

444
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:01,780
this is a variety of
the marathon strategy.

445
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,780
You remember the big thing there was the,
the uh,

446
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,490
Siemens under mill tighties hoped to
win swiftly on the wings where they had

447
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:11,980
greater depths.
They knew they would lose in the middle.

448
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,400
They just hope they would lose slower
than they would win on the wings.

449
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,660
I think this is a version
of the same idea and so,

450
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,280
uh, on this and his, uh, uh,

451
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:30,030
block of feed bins goes to the left and
I would argue in the ancient sources

452
00:32:30,071 --> 00:32:33,160
save is to, uh, swiftly as,

453
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:38,340
as Herata to set of the Athenians
that marathon draw boy on the run.

454
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:44,630
Well, I guess that means on
the truck. And so they were,

455
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,160
they wanted to get that fight going as
fast as they could and to win it as fast

456
00:32:49,161 --> 00:32:49,994
as they could.
Well,

457
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:54,620
that's the essential idea that they
would win powerfully on the left and send

458
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:59,621
the Spartans into route and thereby
destroy their whole campaign.

459
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:06,160
Now we have to account for funny things
that happen apart from the Phalanx

460
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,760
before the battle is over,

461
00:33:10,761 --> 00:33:15,761
both sides take their cavalry from the
usual position on the wings on the flanks

462
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,460
of the Phalanx.

463
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:24,020
Meant either to protect your
wings or to assault the other,

464
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:29,260
the enemy on his wing and move it to
the center of the battlefield where it

465
00:33:30,081 --> 00:33:33,710
plays a role. And so the question
always is, what are they doing?

466
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:37,340
What's this all about? And one here,
I think one can only speculate,

467
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:40,070
uh,

468
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:45,070
surely it would have been a wise thing
for a Pam does to move his cavalry into

469
00:33:46,011 --> 00:33:50,780
the center of the field in front of the
center of his line, not in front of him,

470
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,700
but in front of the guys to his right.

471
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:58,270
Because they too would have had an
effect of slowing down any spartan attack

472
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:04,370
where there was a vulnerability.
So if you take it from that point of view,

473
00:34:04,371 --> 00:34:08,960
you could think to Spartans who
definitely moved there. Cavalry out front,

474
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:14,420
uh, did. So in order to
combat the fiebing cavalry,

475
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:19,680
that would be an explanation enough. But
some scholars make an argument and, uh,

476
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,130
there's some reason to
think they might be right.

477
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,870
That the Spartans seeing what, uh, uh,

478
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,520
Pam anonymous was doing,

479
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,920
knew that he was trying to
flank them on the right side.

480
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,660
And so this,

481
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:40,100
they wanted to take steps to
prevent being flanked on that side.

482
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,030
And so they did something which they
tried to do at the battle of [inaudible],

483
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,070
but it didn't happen for them.

484
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:50,030
They pull troops out from
the center of their line,

485
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,290
sent them around behind the
Phalanx and put them out.

486
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:58,550
They hoped on the right wing to
prevent exactly that kind of an event.

487
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:03,970
But to prevent this as the feed bins
from or the be oceans from charging that

488
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,620
empty spot until it was filled,

489
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,420
they sent their cavalry
upfront to shield them,

490
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:14,210
not only to shield them, but
in effect to, to hide them.

491
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,010
Certainly the cavalry's being out there
would have kicked up a lot of dust and

492
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:23,270
uh, they could have hoped that the
demons wouldn't know what was going on.

493
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,130
So that was the theory.

494
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:29,270
What is a fact is that the oceans,

495
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,740
ocean fact cavalry and the
Spartan Cavalry clashed.

496
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:39,060
And as I think, again, the bookies, if
this happened, would've predicted, um,

497
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:44,870
the feed bins defeated the upheld nations
to Siemens had a superior calvary.

498
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:50,340
Uh, it has to do, of course
with the nature of their land,

499
00:35:50,341 --> 00:35:54,330
which is better for horses
then, uh, most of Greek country.

500
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:59,660
And so they drove the cavalry back into
the Spartan Phalanx helping to create

501
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:07,230
confusion and to break ranks
and all that kind of stuff.

502
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:08,970
But the real payoff,

503
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:14,010
the real victory in the battle was won
where Pam and on this hoped it would be

504
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:17,310
on his left flank on
the Spartan right flank.

505
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,150
I don't think it's an
accident that the Phalanx,

506
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:26,330
the Phalanx came swiftly to the place
where the spartan king was located,

507
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,080
clean Han Broadus and killed him.

508
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:35,730
And if you look at Greek battles
throughout all of their history,

509
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:41,150
killing the general in command is a
really good idea because when you do that,

510
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:45,060
you usually win. If you've got
numbers, uh, Curtis on that,

511
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:49,030
or just got a general idea of,
of how,

512
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:52,740
how often that is a decisive
or important element.

513
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:57,540
It's very frequent, isn't it? When
you kill the general, you'll win.

514
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,780
Curtis knows more about military
history and the Greek world. Anybody.

515
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:04,140
So I have to consultant.
Um,

516
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:10,590
so, uh, that thing, the
case, the Spartans fought

517
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:15,750
bravely and strongly around
the body of their king,

518
00:37:15,751 --> 00:37:20,040
but that only led more than to be killed.
And before very long,

519
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:25,190
the Spartan Phalanx broke and ran and
the thi bins to be oceans had one,

520
00:37:26,581 --> 00:37:28,980
a clear cut,
unmistakable,

521
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:34,220
blatant victory in an normal
hoplite battle on a normal field.

522
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:40,740
And this was the shock felt round.

523
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:44,820
The Greek world that this had happened,
just changed everything.

524
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:46,530
There were only,

525
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:50,550
here's an interesting fact that tells
you something else that's important about

526
00:37:50,551 --> 00:37:51,750
what's going on in the Greek world.

527
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:57,050
There were only perhaps 700 Sparty eights
in the whole battle and of these 400

528
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:06,300
were killed. That's the
think about that. I mean,

529
00:38:06,301 --> 00:38:09,570
that's devastating in so many ways.

530
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,360
Um, and it had this all kinds
of effects. It, we shall see.

531
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:17,390
It immediately shook,
uh,

532
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,930
the control of the Spartans
even over the Peloponnesus. Uh,

533
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,640
it made people think the Spartans were
vulnerable and that they might've come to

534
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:27,474
the end of the line.

535
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:33,380
But another interesting
contrary consequence was
that suddenly Sparta wasn't

536
00:38:35,651 --> 00:38:38,800
scary,
but thieves was very scary.

537
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:43,960
And the Athenians who had already come to,
uh,

538
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:47,710
uh,
be nervous about the Thebans.

539
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,660
You notice I haven't mentioned that
they were, had been the allies of feeds.

540
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:57,700
They were not at the battle of blue truck.
And as a matter of fact,

541
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:02,730
they were clearly working with the
Spartans already to check Steven power and

542
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,570
even expansion before the battle of Luke
trip. They stay where they stay neutral.

543
00:39:07,571 --> 00:39:09,010
They didn't show up at the battle at all,

544
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:14,380
but it tells you a very important
change in the scene, uh, in the,

545
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,240
in the Greek world at this time.

546
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:23,340
So I think it's safe to say the battle
of Luke Tra put an end to spartan

547
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:29,740
supremacy.
This apartment had Germany is over.

548
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:35,670
And now the question that awaits
increases what happens next?

549
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:43,030
I think in the normal course of events,
prior to the buildup of this new themes,

550
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:48,760
uh, there would have been a division
of power between the states.

551
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,250
The Athenians would have used some muscle,

552
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:53,860
the themes would have used some muscle.
Uh,

553
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:57,440
some lesser states would have
emerged in the vacuum created by the,

554
00:39:57,441 --> 00:40:02,110
the destruction of pavement up spartan
power. But that would have been that.

555
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:03,603
However,

556
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:08,670
given all that had happened in the Osha
and the kind of leadership that existed

557
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:14,190
in Thebes, um, something
amazing then happen.

558
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:19,610
The feed bins decided to put an end to
spartan power forever and took a number

559
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:23,290
of measures to bring that about.

560
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:29,100
Just the defeat of Luke tre meant the
disintegration of the Peloponnesian

561
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,550
League,
a number of states,

562
00:40:30,551 --> 00:40:35,551
obviously it took advantage of Sparta
as weakness to just pull out and get out

563
00:40:36,221 --> 00:40:38,620
from under Spartan control.

564
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:42,970
And then in the year three 70,

565
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,970
the theme wins,

566
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,380
put together a tremendous army

567
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,440
and,
uh,

568
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:58,500
ultimately marched into the Peloponnesus
to do what they were going to do.

569
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,830
One of the things that happen

570
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,130
reflecting the collapse of the Spartan,
uh,

571
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:08,770
a Gemini in the Peloponnesus was that the

572
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:14,560
towns in the region of Arcadia,
the mountain,

573
00:41:14,561 --> 00:41:17,320
this region to the north of the Sparta,

574
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:23,190
put themselves together in the
form of the Arcadian League.

575
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,570
And it is,
I mentioned this to you earlier,

576
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:33,571
I believe it is one of the first federal
leagues of a kind from the one we've

577
00:41:34,401 --> 00:41:38,270
seen up to now.
There is no hegemony will state,

578
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:43,600
it is not some big state and it's friends
which even the B Ocean League is still

579
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:45,740
in that category.

580
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:51,220
It is in fact a collection of states
that are extensively equal and this is

581
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:54,440
entirely voluntary.
They are coming together,

582
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:59,770
these Arcadian states in order to
protect themselves and to pursue their

583
00:41:59,991 --> 00:42:04,880
interests against the many troubles
they've had over the years.

584
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:10,480
And uh,
the question always is then there's,

585
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,890
this is a both the evidence
of what I'm saying,

586
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:17,780
that it was a new kind of a league and
it reveals the fact that there was no

587
00:42:17,781 --> 00:42:22,190
state that was sufficiently
superior to the others.

588
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,530
That to make it obvious that the capital,

589
00:42:24,531 --> 00:42:28,190
so to speak of this new
confederation would be that state.

590
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,700
They built a brand new city.

591
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,920
It was called,
I love it.

592
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:39,560
Megalopolis that means it ran
from Washington to Boston.

593
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,470
No, I'm sorry. It meant it meant,

594
00:42:42,471 --> 00:42:47,150
of course it means big
polis, big city, big state,

595
00:42:47,151 --> 00:42:48,670
whatever you want.
Uh,

596
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:53,670
but it was the place where the a
league counsel met State Center,

597
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:56,750
their representatives to it.
Their business was done there.

598
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:01,160
And it's really quite
an interesting event,

599
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,490
especially as you look ahead
in the history of Greason.

600
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,930
And as I told you last time,

601
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,440
that kind of thing had a
remarkable influence on the
thinking of the shapers of

602
00:43:11,931 --> 00:43:13,190
the American constitution.

603
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:18,230
You Athenians attitude towards this.

604
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:24,100
We think about all this long
rivalry between Sparta and
Athens that had resulted

605
00:43:24,591 --> 00:43:29,210
in such terrible wars.
It just goes to show you,

606
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:34,100
what was it, a palmist in the
19th century British statesmen,

607
00:43:34,101 --> 00:43:39,101
I think he wants said Britain has
no permanent friends or enemies,

608
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,710
only permanent interests.

609
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,890
And I think what, whether that was true
or Britain or not at the time, I think,

610
00:43:51,891 --> 00:43:56,891
and we should always realize that that
is true of the way states operate in an

611
00:43:57,171 --> 00:43:58,430
international system.

612
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:03,590
It is not that they don't
have inclinations and
longstanding friendships do have

613
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:07,910
some impact and longstanding
enmities have a greater impact.

614
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,670
And yet anything can happen.

615
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:13,650
I mean just to get some sense of that.
Uh,

616
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:16,940
who would have believed that,
uh,

617
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:22,300
in the 1930s that Great Britain and
France would join with Joseph Stalin's

618
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:31,190
Soviet Union for any purpose,
whatever,

619
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:32,760
since they,

620
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:37,740
especially the British had been interested
in putting an end to that regime from

621
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:42,540
the moment that it was invented and that
Winston Churchill would be the greatest

622
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:46,860
advocate of this alliance with
styling Winston Churchill,

623
00:44:46,861 --> 00:44:51,861
who had been the leading figure in having
an invasion of Russia in 19 2021 in

624
00:44:52,291 --> 00:44:56,820
order to bring down the Bolshevik
regime and what Churchill, his answer,

625
00:44:56,821 --> 00:45:00,190
I think to the question of
why you're doing this, uh,

626
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:03,990
tells you a lot about this
general point I'm trying to make.

627
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,760
I'm not going to get this exactly right.

628
00:45:05,761 --> 00:45:10,560
I don't have Churchill's gift and my
memory is fading. But, uh, and he said,

629
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:13,770
if, you know, why are you
joining up with stolen? You know,

630
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:18,660
you've been denouncing him forever.
He said, he said, if the devil,

631
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:23,160
no, I'm sorry. If Hitler invaded hill,

632
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:25,110
at the very least,

633
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:29,790
I would want to say a few kind words
about the devil in the House of Commons.

634
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,030
That ought to tell you something about
the permanence of these kinds of thing.

635
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,970
Interests are what matter.

636
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:43,860
And He,
this Athenian interests had changed.

637
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:49,490
Thebes was becoming a challenge to the
Athenian growth and influence and power

638
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:56,870
and they did not want the Thebans now
to destroy Sparta has control of the

639
00:45:57,841 --> 00:46:02,841
Peloponnesus and replace it
with a Thevenin control of
the Peloponnesus and that

640
00:46:02,941 --> 00:46:05,830
accounts both full white,
uh,

641
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:10,910
Athens is not helping the Thebans but
also in fact intriguing with states in the

642
00:46:11,791 --> 00:46:16,791
Peloponnesus to try to stand up to
the feed bins rather than to do what,

643
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:19,200
what might seem obvious.

644
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:23,690
Now the Thebans we're continue, I'm, I'll,

645
00:46:23,691 --> 00:46:27,810
I'll come back to their invasion just
a moment. They were continuing to grow.

646
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:32,540
They were gaining allies in,
uh,

647
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,490
central Greece forces.

648
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:40,530
He totally IA at cornea low.
Chris, you'll be here again,

649
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:44,910
I'm going to be teaching you general
truths about international relations that

650
00:46:44,911 --> 00:46:48,660
are, don't seem to be a part
of the ordinary education.

651
00:46:48,661 --> 00:46:51,240
And that is power.

652
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:56,300
Has a fantastically attractive quality
when a state is suddenly enormously

653
00:46:56,671 --> 00:47:01,290
powerful. You know, I think the
political scientists rules, uh, I,

654
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:05,070
and I admit that what I just said has
been known and said by many of them many

655
00:47:05,071 --> 00:47:09,120
times. But the favorite thing is if
there's a great power, what happens next?

656
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:14,240
What happens is all the other states get
together and join up to two to control

657
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:19,700
that power to which the answer
is sometimes a lot of times,

658
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,730
and that they have another term
to consider the alternative,

659
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:28,850
which they called Bandwagon bandwagoning
and that is states are attracted by

660
00:47:29,501 --> 00:47:33,130
that power. Want to get on the right side
of that power, join up with that power.

661
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,720
And that's what happened here,
where suddenly

662
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,910
the theme and power in that area that
became seem so strong that you wanted to

663
00:47:42,911 --> 00:47:47,860
be on that side. I'm just in this
terrible and that analogizing mood today.

664
00:47:47,861 --> 00:47:49,230
So please forgive me.
But,

665
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:53,530
but lest you think the study of
ancient history is not relevant to your

666
00:47:53,531 --> 00:47:55,000
understanding of the world today,

667
00:47:55,001 --> 00:47:57,490
and I know none of you would
be so foolish as to think that.

668
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:02,380
Let me just point out, just look
what's happening in the Middle East,

669
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,190
and I'll say it before it's common wisdom
so that you will see how smart I am,

670
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:15,460
Syria, which has been nothing
but trouble for our side. Uh,

671
00:48:15,461 --> 00:48:19,900
all this time all of a sudden seems
to be behaving in a different way.

672
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:25,410
And even the United States government
says that the Syrian seemed not to be

673
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:30,640
feeding more al Qaeda people
across the border into Iraq.

674
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,810
Why is that? What have they
found? Religion? Oh, I guess
they had religion already,

675
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:39,070
but um,
um,

676
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:44,770
the answer is because suddenly the
American forces are kicking hell out of

677
00:48:44,771 --> 00:48:49,330
everybody and Iraq and suddenly there's
a powerful American army sitting there,

678
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:54,220
which is right next door to Iran, to
Syria. It's also right next door we run.

679
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:57,690
We should have interesting
consequences to, um,

680
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:01,660
the result is that the Syrians are
suddenly talking very differently.

681
00:49:01,661 --> 00:49:05,440
Now that doesn't mean that there'll be
a permanent change that will depend upon

682
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:08,350
realities, but it's, I, you need to,

683
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:12,250
you get fed so much gunk
in a different direction.

684
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:16,480
The most important single element
in international relations,

685
00:49:16,481 --> 00:49:17,950
not the only one by any means,

686
00:49:17,951 --> 00:49:22,951
but the most important one is power and
the perception of where the power is and

687
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:29,710
the perception of whether that
power is growing or shrinking.

688
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:34,420
Nothing is as important as that.
Everything else contributes,

689
00:49:34,421 --> 00:49:36,340
but it doesn't have that central role.

690
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:41,370
Well that's the situation that the feed
bins have created with their victory.

691
00:49:42,401 --> 00:49:44,710
And so they are expanding
all over the place.

692
00:49:44,711 --> 00:49:48,050
They are even Stevens with
great land Lubbers. They are,

693
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:52,120
they're even building a navy.
They are moving out into the Aegean Sea.

694
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:53,813
And uh,

695
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,300
that's one of the things that has
created this nervousness in Athens and

696
00:49:58,301 --> 00:50:00,520
explains the Athenian behavior.

697
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:06,280
Now comes this great invasion in the,

698
00:50:06,281 --> 00:50:08,800
over the year three 73 69,

699
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:15,840
the total force of hoplites in the
army put together by [inaudible].

700
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:22,640
This is reported to be 40,000.

701
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:28,540
Now there's just not a
number like that, uh, in,

702
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:31,970
in the whole fifth century
basically or anytime before this.

703
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,580
It's just an amazing army.

704
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:40,060
And we are told there were some 30,000
others on the campaign who were not

705
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:44,000
hoplites.
Maybe many of them weren't even fighters,

706
00:50:44,001 --> 00:50:47,870
but a lot of them would have been cavalry,
light armed infantry and so on.

707
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,930
But in any case here,
a 70,000 people,

708
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:57,100
meaning no good to the Spartans pouring
into the Peloponnesus in that year,

709
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:03,380
it is the largest military
force reported in Greek history.

710
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:10,110
The leading the men in charge of these
two extraordinary men at feminine does

711
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:16,340
and Palapa Das who repeatedly had
proved themselves, by the way,

712
00:51:16,341 --> 00:51:20,990
it was Palapa Das who won that
victory in three 75 at to Gyra.

713
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:22,760
Remember that with the 300.

714
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:28,340
So he has that great victory on his
record and feminine does of course is the

715
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:32,480
architect of the victory at Luke Tra.
And uh,

716
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:37,400
they just are amazing and remarkable
people. If you read some of those,

717
00:51:37,401 --> 00:51:38,660
uh,
we,

718
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:42,900
we do not have a blue chalk
biography of APAM anonymous,

719
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:46,520
although he does give us a Palapa at us.
We're happy about that.

720
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,770
But the owl before I got through,

721
00:51:48,771 --> 00:51:53,660
I will try to remedy that as I tried to
do in the case of THRASS of Boulez by

722
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:58,150
bringing to your attention how
great was the reputation of Epam.

723
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,710
Anon does in the Greek world.

724
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:05,480
Maybe I should just say a
word about him now. He, um,

725
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:10,700
he is reputed to have been
a person of great intellect.

726
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:16,090
Apparently he was a philosopher and a
took that seriously and was respect with

727
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:21,940
regard with respect by others,
uh,

728
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:26,390
of that elk in that world.
And uh, of course he looks,

729
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:28,670
it looks very much as though he is

730
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:34,880
a man of political convictions
of such a kindness,

731
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:38,000
almost a suggest political theory.
I mean,

732
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:43,030
he seems to have been committed really
to the idea of democracy as a good thing

733
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:49,430
in itself. On this latter point, we
just don't have very much evidence.

734
00:52:49,431 --> 00:52:53,930
No nothing that he said. Uh,
but we do have what he did,

735
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:59,030
which squares perfectly with what we
are talking about. It would be, I mean,

736
00:52:59,031 --> 00:53:03,200
it breaks my heart there.
These lives that Plutarch did not right.

737
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,710
What I would give for a life of Christ,

738
00:53:05,711 --> 00:53:09,980
the knees by Plutarch and
similarly of EPAM anonymous.

739
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:14,450
Uh, and I'm amazed, I don't know who
knows why blue tarp did what he did,

740
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,520
but in any case,

741
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:21,410
it would be really fascinating in his
case because of the complicated nature of

742
00:53:21,411 --> 00:53:22,820
his mind and his life.

743
00:53:22,821 --> 00:53:27,821
But there he is along with Palapas
leading this armed force in there.

744
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,490
They move down into Laconia,

745
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:36,480
the home territory of the Spartans.

746
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:41,510
Now the Spartans are forced to huddle
in their city and to try to resist

747
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,540
anything that comes at them.

748
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:50,870
They cannot go out to fight these
people invading their homeland.

749
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:54,900
Their fucking homeland has never
been invaded in anybody's memory.

750
00:53:54,901 --> 00:53:58,560
This is out of the question. Nothing
like this would have been possible.

751
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:02,850
And here they are just
hiding in their city,

752
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:07,110
not even a walled city because it was part
of their pride. They don't need walls.

753
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:11,040
They have an army. Nobody can come
in there and attack their city.

754
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,950
And there they are.
And what does a Pam Anon does do?

755
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:19,070
He does not go after them in that city
because probably he has a one reason

756
00:54:21,181 --> 00:54:24,090
would have been fighting in the city.
You know,

757
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:29,810
urban warfare is always difficult and
costly and nobody until lately is really

758
00:54:31,741 --> 00:54:33,850
good at it. Uh, I mean if,

759
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:37,380
I don't know how much you've paid
attention to what's going on in Iraq these

760
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:40,560
days in the so called
surge, but when you, if you,

761
00:54:40,561 --> 00:54:45,540
if you study it as a military problem
and then you see how they dealt with that

762
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:46,710
military problem,

763
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:52,340
it is one of the really most brilliant
things I have ever seen because it would

764
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:57,240
be successful in this, in, in
the war I'm talking about now,

765
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:02,280
requires not only shrewd use of
military forces for military purposes,

766
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:07,640
but it has to be integrated with constant
political negotiation and conversation

767
00:55:08,551 --> 00:55:09,384
with the natives,

768
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:14,250
which has to be associated also with
certain economic conditions being brought

769
00:55:14,251 --> 00:55:18,130
about. So that the, uh,
the people who are, uh,

770
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:22,020
might be on the other side can be on
your side and then you can have them work

771
00:55:22,021 --> 00:55:23,460
for you.
Uh,

772
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:28,380
and I've only touched on the beginning
of all the complexity of that. So,

773
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:31,980
but in any case, which until
that, until until that happened,

774
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:37,190
there are very few cases
of really successful urban
warfare without a tremendous

775
00:55:37,381 --> 00:55:40,530
cost. Well, of course, before they
figured out what to do in Iraq,

776
00:55:40,531 --> 00:55:43,290
they had some tremendous
costs of not figuring it out.

777
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:47,490
But what I'm getting at is, yes, I'm sure
that if a patent on this and wanted to,

778
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:51,990
he would have, uh, been able to
defeat the Spartans in their city,

779
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,690
but he would have paid a great price.
Now,

780
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:59,040
there's perhaps another consideration,

781
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,930
uh, what he, what that, let
me, before I come to that,

782
00:56:03,931 --> 00:56:05,210
let me just tell you that what the,

783
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:10,290
but apartment houses did his bypass
the city ravage what the countryside,

784
00:56:11,671 --> 00:56:13,060
where ever he founded,

785
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:17,610
doing as much harm as he possibly could.

786
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:22,890
And even as this was happening and was
obviously reported back to the Spartans,

787
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:27,190
the Spartans did not come out to fight.
Now here.

788
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,400
Here's where I think once again,
Victor Hansen's,

789
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:34,290
a splendid imagination,
uh,

790
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:39,070
comes into the picture in what I find
to be a very persuasive explanation of

791
00:56:39,071 --> 00:56:39,910
what's going on.

792
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:45,210
And he'd makes this explanation based
on an analogy he draws with the army of

793
00:56:46,241 --> 00:56:51,241
General Sherman during the American civil
war when Sherman's famous march to the

794
00:56:53,171 --> 00:56:58,171
sea or is march through Georgia when there
is a confederate army to the north of

795
00:57:01,301 --> 00:57:05,470
where he goes,
but he doesn't seek them out.

796
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:11,170
He goes marching towards
where he wants to get to,

797
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:15,220
doing as much damage as he possibly can,

798
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:19,930
destroying the food,
the crops,

799
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:22,180
animals,
uh,

800
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:27,780
everything he had burning down houses
being as nasty and unpleasant as he can

801
00:57:28,031 --> 00:57:32,500
be. Uh, why is the question,

802
00:57:32,501 --> 00:57:36,410
will he be nasty, unpleasant
fellow? Not really. He, we,

803
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:40,360
we do know a lot about what
Sherman thought he was doing
cause he wrote about it.

804
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:46,060
Sherman apparently hated
this southern slave.

805
00:57:46,061 --> 00:57:51,061
Ocracy he wasn't satisfied with defeating
the south as many a northerner was and

806
00:57:54,191 --> 00:57:59,140
then sort of letting it be what it had
been before or perhaps destroying slavery

807
00:57:59,141 --> 00:58:02,740
itself and leaving everything else.
Pretty much as it had been.

808
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:07,510
He seems to have thought this
was a terrible wicked society.

809
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:11,620
And if it wasn't to go
back to its old bad ways,

810
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:15,970
it not only had to be defeated,
it had to be humiliated.

811
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:18,160
Part of his,
his view,

812
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:22,680
part of the success of the south was in
building up what he would've thought of

813
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:27,130
as a myth of their
aristocratic superiority,

814
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:31,780
which made slave holding appropriate
because the people who were superior were

815
00:58:31,781 --> 00:58:36,781
ruling over people who were inferior
and they deserved it because they were

816
00:58:37,001 --> 00:58:38,890
better fighters than anybody else.

817
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:41,320
Everybody a thought at
the beginning of the war,

818
00:58:41,321 --> 00:58:45,250
certainly that the south had a better
military tradition and that they were

819
00:58:45,251 --> 00:58:48,640
better soldiers and I think they were,
uh,

820
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:51,430
and that they were courageous.

821
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:56,670
Being a great military man means being
courageous and all of that justify the

822
00:58:56,951 --> 00:59:01,120
system and provided the pride that
made it possible to work well.

823
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:03,160
Sherman wanted to show it wasn't so,

824
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:08,250
and here they were burning down houses
and Barns and food and the women folk

825
00:59:09,911 --> 00:59:13,240
having to stand there and watch it.
And where was the confederate army?

826
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:19,330
He didn't come down to challenge them
and he felt in the process he was

827
00:59:19,331 --> 00:59:23,840
destroying the myth that was more potent.
Well,

828
00:59:23,841 --> 00:59:28,100
I think he's so handsome. Certainly has
that right when he talks about Sherman,

829
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:32,430
and it's very attractive to
think that may be Pam Anon.

830
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,130
This was after the same thing.

831
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:38,810
Here were the Spartans
cowering in their city.

832
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:43,840
It would be said while a Pam and on
this was doing as he liked with the

833
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:45,380
Peloponnesus.

834
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:50,750
There would never again be a time where
people would accept the story that the

835
00:59:50,751 --> 00:59:55,280
Spartans with a great fighter is the great
heroes, et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera.

836
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:59,510
In any case, that's what
he did. And then it wasn't.

837
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:04,690
I think all of this is assisted by some
of the things he did and some of the

838
01:00:05,931 --> 01:00:08,540
things that he actually said.

839
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,580
He went to Macedonia.

840
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:16,660
And indeed he went to the place where
the Mycenaeans had withdrawn for security

841
01:00:18,701 --> 01:00:21,370
and in their rebellions up there,
uh,

842
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:26,560
and he established or reestablished
a city called Mess Sini.

843
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:33,110
It was powerfully fortify.
There was up on a mountain.

844
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:36,320
It was a place where you
could really defend it.

845
01:00:36,321 --> 01:00:39,650
And it became the capital of Miscellanea,

846
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:44,360
which would now be a Freeman seenia
in which the former [inaudible],

847
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:47,300
the former slaves of the spartan state,

848
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:52,660
would now rule their own country
as they had not done for centuries.

849
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:57,380
And it was a liberation and it was,

850
01:00:57,381 --> 01:01:00,980
that was the language that
Apam Anon is used of it.

851
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:06,700
It had the marvelous psychological
effects that I'm speaking of.

852
01:01:07,101 --> 01:01:12,101
And also a very practical one here was
a fortress on the flank of the Spartans,

853
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:16,400
which was controlled by people
who hated the Spartans bitterly.

854
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:21,470
And that would guarantee that the Spartans
would not likely gain control of the

855
01:01:21,471 --> 01:01:25,370
western Peloponnesus.
Again, if you add to that,

856
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:30,670
that the Arcadians had suffered plenty
from the Spartans and we're unwilling to

857
01:01:30,681 --> 01:01:32,390
allow the Spartans to rise again,

858
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:37,400
and there was megalopolis
a walled powerful city that
would see to it that the

859
01:01:37,401 --> 01:01:41,510
Spartans would never likely be able to
make their way into control of central

860
01:01:41,511 --> 01:01:43,370
and northern Peloponnesus again.

861
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:48,700
And so all of this combination of
power and the strategic use of power,

862
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:52,440
uh,

863
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:56,990
along with this psychological
warfare that was involved,

864
01:01:57,350 --> 01:02:02,270
brought about the, uh,
permanent check on Sparta,

865
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:07,070
Sparta. Amazingly enough, when emerged
from this still an independent city,

866
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:10,640
still somehow taken seriously by others,

867
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:15,760
but never again in the
position of threatening the
security of a other stakes.

868
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:22,080
Now, some of what was happening, uh,

869
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:26,010
began to create a counter
force as it always does.

870
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:31,610
Here was this blatantly democratic
force that had been unleashed in the

871
01:02:32,011 --> 01:02:36,090
Peloponnesus, most of which had
always been oligarchic. So in Arcadia,

872
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:41,390
there began to be a revival
of oligarchic activity.

873
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:47,130
People who wanted to overthrow the
regime that was being established and to

874
01:02:47,131 --> 01:02:49,530
restore oligarchic governments,

875
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:54,030
which would of course naturally
be friendly to Sparta.

876
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:59,420
And some of these oligarchs in
Arcadia began to assist the Spartans.

877
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:04,430
We know the Spartans were finished,
but they didn't know it.

878
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:09,280
The Greeks at the time didn't know it.
So that I'm,

879
01:03:09,281 --> 01:03:11,820
I'm just touching on the high points here.

880
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:15,690
In three 62 by now,

881
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:19,080
I should report that Palapa Diaz was dead.

882
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:23,990
He had died fighting
incessantly against a, uh, uh,

883
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:29,410
an autocrat there by the name of
Jason from the city of Fareye. Uh,

884
01:03:29,411 --> 01:03:30,141
who about it,

885
01:03:30,141 --> 01:03:33,420
and we don't know a lot except to say
you've got to be very powerful indeed,

886
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:38,630
and was pretty soon challenging both
thieves on the land and also challenging

887
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:42,780
Athens to some degree at sea. Uh, and he,

888
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:46,980
who knows how much trouble he would have
made had he not died before he could do

889
01:03:46,981 --> 01:03:51,900
so. But apartment, sorry. Palapa does
died fighting in a battle against, uh,

890
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:56,370
uh, Jason, I think it was
three 64. So in three 62,

891
01:03:57,090 --> 01:04:02,070
when the Thebans again put together a
forced to invade the Peloponnesus to put

892
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:06,030
down those forces that were
working against his settlement,

893
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:09,900
it was only EPAM. Anon
does, who was in charge

894
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:17,070
apparently in the battle of [inaudible].
This is the second battle of Maton Nia,

895
01:04:17,071 --> 01:04:21,690
the first took place in the Peloponnesian
war and four 18 but this one in three

896
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,720
62, apparently, uh,

897
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:29,750
upenn monotonous use some of the very
same tactics that had been successful in

898
01:04:30,991 --> 01:04:33,180
the, uh, in the battle that look,

899
01:04:33,181 --> 01:04:37,920
Trump and the thi bins won
the battle of lecture, uh,

900
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:40,980
of, uh, uh, man Tinea, however,

901
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:44,430
at Pamet on vis was
killed in the fighting.

902
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:49,740
And it turned out that that was
more important than anything else.

903
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:54,300
W with both Palapa das and Epam,
Anon does gone.

904
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:59,960
Thebes never again shows that kind of
special quality that brought it swiftly to

905
01:05:01,561 --> 01:05:05,880
power and will swiftly bring it down.
Although we,

906
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:08,160
as we look at the world in three 62,

907
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:13,520
we should realize that Thebes
remains a very formidable power.

908
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,290
And the Greeks, again, I want to more new,

909
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:20,500
don't know that seems isn't going to
come back and with two new leaders or 10

910
01:05:20,501 --> 01:05:21,880
new leaders or one or whatever,

911
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:25,660
and become the same kind of a
menace that it had been before.

912
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:30,160
But looking back,
we can see that that was the outcome.

913
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:35,050
So, uh, this evening has won the victory,

914
01:05:35,051 --> 01:05:40,051
but in effect they really lost the war
because that was the end of their special

915
01:05:40,181 --> 01:05:44,530
quality.
CICERO writing about this year,

916
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:48,430
centuries later called Epam Pamet on desk,

917
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:51,130
the foremost man of Greece,

918
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:56,650
there is an inscription or there
wasn't an inscription on it,

919
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:01,300
[inaudible] statue that was
erected on his death at Thebes.

920
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:06,850
And it is as though he was speaking,
it must have been taken somehow,

921
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:09,430
uh,
from something he said or wrote.

922
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:14,610
Here's what he said by my plans was
Sparta Shorn of her glory and Holy Miss

923
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:24,120
Seenia had last received back her
children by the weapons of Thebes was miss

924
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:31,410
seenia fortified and all Greece
became independent and free.

925
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:36,880
Now,
of course,

926
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:40,630
the claim that everybody was seeking
independence for the Greeks out tonal.

927
01:06:40,631 --> 01:06:43,990
Mia is an old stale,
uh,

928
01:06:43,991 --> 01:06:48,820
one that never really worked.
This is the first time that I am aware.

929
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,230
No, I should, that's not true.

930
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:55,090
The Spartans entered the Peloponnesian
war claiming that they were fighting to

931
01:06:55,091 --> 01:06:56,590
free the Greeks,

932
01:06:56,710 --> 01:07:00,550
but of course they immediately began in
slaving as many of them as they could

933
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:05,050
when they won the war. But
a Pam and don says, well,

934
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:10,800
we did this, we accomplish this. And
at the end of the day, the Greeks, the,

935
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:14,170
the, uh, all of Greece was free.

936
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:18,700
He claimed sure it wasn't perfectly true,
but there was a lot in it.

937
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:23,500
And, uh, that's what he was proud of.
That's what he thought he was doing.

938
01:07:23,501 --> 01:07:25,690
I think that's the important
point about that quotation.

939
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:29,410
It tells us what he would have wanted,
has indeed,

940
01:07:29,411 --> 01:07:32,350
and has worked out that way
to come down as his legacy.

941
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:37,590
What did a Honda did he say he
increased the power of Thebes tenfold?

942
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:42,000
He made Thebes name ringing the
Valhalla. He never heard of Valhalla, um,

943
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:46,940
in the Valhalla of heroes
throughout history. Uh,

944
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:51,550
that's not what he wanted to have said.
What he wanted it to have said was,

945
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:55,060
I restored the Mycenaeans to their land.

946
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:58,780
I restored them to safety.
I gave them freedom.

947
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:03,310
I left Greece free and independent

948
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:07,360
Xenophon writing.

949
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:12,700
After his description of the battle
of Manton, it says the following,

950
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:17,990
and these are the last words in his
[inaudible] and his history of Greek

951
01:08:17,991 --> 01:08:18,800
affairs.

952
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:23,800
In his time since nearly all the people
of Greece have come together or had come

953
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:27,140
together and form themselves
in opposing lines,

954
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:32,420
there was no one who did not suppose
that if a battle were fought,

955
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:35,600
those who proved victorious
would be the rulers.

956
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:40,820
And those who were defeated would be
their subjects while each side claimed to

957
01:08:40,821 --> 01:08:41,840
be victorious.

958
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:47,360
Neither was found to be any better
off than before the battle took place.

959
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:53,020
But there was even more confusion and
disorder in Greece after the battle than

960
01:08:54,531 --> 01:08:58,820
before. So here's a case for the, um,

961
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:01,760
the unimportance of warfare.

962
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:04,280
You might say for those people
that want to make that case,

963
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:08,960
that hair was all this fighting here are
all the dead. And at the end of the day,

964
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:13,100
nothing had been settled.
That is often the case in war,

965
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:18,460
although it might be said that something
pretty serious had been settled by the

966
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:23,950
campaigns that the feed bins had fought
before the battle of Manson, Nia.

967
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:29,250
And at before the battle of math and the
and that Greece will never be the same

968
01:09:29,601 --> 01:09:33,290
again because of the fighting
that had taken place before.

969
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:37,550
But as we look forward,
not backwards,

970
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:43,460
it's worth noticing that that the
years of competition for had Gemini,

971
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:45,980
which go back,
you know,

972
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:50,981
at least to the days after the Persian
wars had left Greece weakened and divided

973
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:59,980
and therefore open for exploitation
and even conquest by a new threat from

974
01:10:03,351 --> 01:10:04,520
outside the system,

975
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:10,450
which was not even dreamed of by the
Greeks as a menace in three 62 at the bat

976
01:10:12,681 --> 01:10:17,030
and Love Man Antonia.
And there's something to be learned in,

977
01:10:17,031 --> 01:10:21,200
in there too. I mean if you had
taken a poll of the Greeks and said,

978
01:10:21,201 --> 01:10:25,550
where are the dangers to us now?
What problems do we have?

979
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:30,200
What they would have been talking about
the traditional conflicts between the

980
01:10:30,201 --> 01:10:31,730
Greek city states.

981
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:37,030
No one I think with have used the word
Macedonia as part of anything that looked

982
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:40,843
scary.

983
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:44,960
And of course nobody would have uttered
the name Phillip Because Phillip wasn't

984
01:10:44,961 --> 01:10:49,730
even king of Macedonia yet.
And yet within a few years,

985
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:54,170
Phillip would be the king of Macedonia,
and within a couple of three decades,

986
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:58,190
it would suddenly be a
real menace from the north.

987
01:10:58,370 --> 01:11:02,180
That would be very threatening,
and we'll take a look at that next time.
