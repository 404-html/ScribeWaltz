1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,890
I wanted to talk to you today about the
beginnings of the Greek experience as

2
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:10,890
far as we know it.
Um,

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,950
and I should warn you at once that
the further back in history you go,

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,770
the less secure is your knowledge,
especially as a,

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,100
I will be doing it at the beginning of
our talk today when you are in a truly

6
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:30,270
prehistoric period that is before the,
uh,

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,420
there is any written evidence from the
period in which you are interested.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,480
So what we do,
what,

9
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,530
what we think we know derives
chiefly from archeological evidence,

10
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:49,680
which is before writing mute evidence
that has to be interpreted and is very

11
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:51,810
complicated and is far from secure.

12
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,290
Even a question such as date,

13
00:00:55,291 --> 00:01:00,291
which is so critical for historians is
really quite approximate and subject to

14
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:05,250
controversy, uh, as is just
about every single thing.

15
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:10,251
I will tell you for the next few days
we'll be even more than usual subject to

16
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:15,690
controversy about the most
fundamental things. So, uh,

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,160
what you'll be hearing are approximations
as best we can make them of what's

18
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:22,380
going on.
Well,

19
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,220
we begin our story with the emergence
of the Bronze Age in the Aegean Sea area

20
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,620
that appears to have
taken place about 3000 BC.

21
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,780
I think these days they date it down
about another century to about 2,900.

22
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,260
Precision is impossible.
Don't worry about that. Uh,

23
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,460
and what we find,
the first example of a Bronze Age,

24
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,020
and I used the word civilization now
for the first time because before the

25
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:59,970
bronze age, there is nothing that
we would define as civilization.

26
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,390
Civilization involves the establishment
of permanent dwelling areas that we call

27
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:11,460
cities. Uh, as opposed to villages.

28
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:16,080
Agricultural villages will have existed
all over the place in the late stone age

29
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:20,310
in the Neolithic period is as it is
known. But there is a difference. Uh,

30
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:22,950
and a critical difference is that a city,

31
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,460
it contains a number of people
who do not provide for their own,

32
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,520
uh, support. That is to say
they don't produce food.

33
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,580
They need to acquire
it from somebody else.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
They do various things like govern and
our priests and our bureaucrats and our

35
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:45,920
other, uh, non productive
activities that, uh,

36
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,180
depend upon others to feed them.

37
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,980
That's the most narrow definition
of a cities. Of course,

38
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:57,920
with cities, we typically find
a whole association, uh, of, uh,

39
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,720
cultural characteristics
we deem civilization.

40
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,123
Well,

41
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,930
that's what we see for the first time in
the hygiene area on the island of Crete.

42
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,330
That civilization was
uncovered by the archeologists,

43
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,790
right at the beginning
of the 20th century,

44
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,800
Sir Arthur Evans and Englishman was
responsible for the major work that has

45
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:25,390
revealed that civilization.
He was captivated by it.

46
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,160
He, uh, I, at one point, he,

47
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:32,110
I think he convinced himself that he
was a descendant of the kings of that,

48
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,700
uh, civilization. But in
any case, uh, he named it,

49
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,850
he named it after the
legendary King of Crete,

50
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:45,100
who appears in the Greek mythology
by the name of my nos. Am I Wes? So,

51
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,320
uh, he referred to that civilization
has the, my no one civilization.

52
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,790
And when we use the word my no one,
we mean the,

53
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,650
the civilization whose home is Crete.

54
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,720
It's spread out beyond creek because
the minor ones established what we might

55
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,860
want to call an empire in various
parts of the Mediterranean.

56
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,000
Um, and it's, it's, um, it's,

57
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:11,380
it's starts with creek.

58
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,620
It is a Bronze Age culture and it is the
first civilization we know in the area

59
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:22,060
and what we find, uh, in the
minnow and civilization. Chiefly.

60
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,480
I mean, the main place we can, uh,

61
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:30,510
learn about the civilization from was
the city of [inaudible] sauce located on

62
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:35,911
the northern shore of Crete
were a great palace complex,

63
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,580
was discovered and is available.
And by the way,

64
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:44,530
it's an absolutely beautiful site, great
tourist site. You can see quite a lot,

65
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,120
uh, there anyway, that, um,

66
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,780
when you examine that site and draw the
conclusions that are in inevitable from

67
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:55,870
examining it.
And,

68
00:04:55,871 --> 00:05:00,070
and also I should have said all of
them I know and settlements you, uh,

69
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:05,340
realize that they look and
seem very much like older,

70
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,970
uh, civilizations that have grown
up in the ancient, Near East.

71
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:15,250
The real sort of typical home of the
kinds of things we're talking about,

72
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,840
uh, is Mesopotamia,
modern Iraq, the Tigris,

73
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:20,860
Euphrates valley,

74
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,280
spreading out beyond Iraq and going
up into Syria and neighboring places.

75
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,700
It too was very similar
to the civilization.

76
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,730
Apparently a little bit newer in the Nile
Valley in Egypt about which we know a

77
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:42,720
great deal more than we know about them.
I know ones because as you know, uh,

78
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,930
in the 19th century,

79
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,080
scholars discovered how
to read the languages that
were written in Egypt and in

80
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:52,200
Mesopotamia and,
uh,

81
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:57,100
are able to develop something approaching
history for the period we're talking

82
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,700
about. That is not true
for create because, uh,

83
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,760
although they had a script and we have
available to us tablets with those

84
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,400
writings on them to this day,

85
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,700
no one has deciphered the language
written by the minor ones and therefore we

86
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:20,270
don't have that kind of knowledge.
So barring that, nonetheless,

87
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:25,271
what we see reminds us very much
of these ancient bronze age early

88
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:27,990
civilizations.
Uh,

89
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and so that will be significant as we
talk about how the Greeks different from

90
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:38,180
that, which gets us to the
Greeks. Excuse me. The,

91
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:42,920
my ones are not Greeks.
Strictly speaking,

92
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,830
what do we mean when we
say somebody is Greek?

93
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,200
We mean that his native language,
not one that he's acquired subsequently,

94
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:55,040
but the one that he learned
as a child was Greek.

95
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,650
Some version of the Greek language,
these are linguistic terms,

96
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:02,950
but of course the people
who spoke to them,

97
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,890
especially in the early years tended
to be part of a relatively narrow

98
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,660
collection of people who
intermarried with each other.

99
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:15,740
Chief leap and therefore develop
common cultural characteristics.

100
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,540
So of course the language is only a clue
when you, when you speak about Greeks,

101
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:25,100
you will be speaking about something more
than merely the fact that they spoke a

102
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:29,720
certain language in the 19th century.
There was a lot of talk about races.

103
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,430
They were people who spoke about the
Greek race or similar races for quite a

104
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:39,431
long time in the science of
anthropology and subjects like that.

105
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,980
It's been determined that
those terms are inappropriate.

106
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:47,981
They suggest there's something in the
genes that explain the characteristics of

107
00:07:48,421 --> 00:07:53,330
a particular people. That is certainly
not true. So let's understand each other.

108
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:56,870
We're talking about a culture when
we're talking about the Greeks,

109
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,180
which is most strikingly a signified
by the language that is spoken.

110
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,673
Well,

111
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,270
the way we can reason things out from
the evidence we have suggests that Greek

112
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:13,271
speaking peoples came down into
the area around the Aegean Sea,

113
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:19,690
perhaps around 2000 BC about a thousand
years later than the emergence of the

114
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:22,970
mine own civilization at Creek.
And again,

115
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:26,060
I think these days they tend to down
date it by another century or so.

116
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:29,600
So it might be around 1900 BC.

117
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,310
And we really don't know very much
about these early Greek settlers.

118
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,270
And we begin to know more about,
owes three,

119
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:46,271
400 years down the road when there appear
buildings and settlements in the world

120
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:54,731
later inhabited by the Greeks as we
know to which we give the name Mycenaean

121
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,080
now that derives from one site in the
North Eastern Peloponnesus called my Sini

122
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,740
and the name is given because in the
poems of homer and the Iliad and the

123
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:14,010
Odyssey,
the leading Greek king,

124
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:19,310
the man who was the leader of the
expedition to Troy is Agamemnon,

125
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,390
who is king of the Argo Lid region
and his Palestine. His home,

126
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,340
uh,
are at my Ct.

127
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:33,050
And that's why we call the entire culture
bronze age culture running from about

128
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:38,490
1,602,
perhaps as late as 1100,

129
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:40,110
but perhaps not so late.

130
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,180
That's what we mean when we speak about
the Mycenaeans, the Mycenaean period.

131
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,660
And please keep it in mind that they
are Greek speakers and we know that with

132
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:56,040
confidence, something we didn't know
at the beginning of the 20th century

133
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,540
because written evidence is available
on a bunch of clay tablets that were

134
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:09,110
accidentally baked in some
conflagration in these, uh,

135
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,280
places.
Uh,

136
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:15,590
same thing is true of a canal sauce in
Crete and perhaps a few other sites in

137
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:19,350
Crete. Not, not at the same time,

138
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:24,000
but the reason we have any written
evidence at all is that where we have it,

139
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,240
there was some kind of conflagration that
produced a fire that baked clay into a

140
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:30,540
pottery.

141
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,890
If in the normal course of events played
as a clay dissolves and disappears and

142
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:37,590
any message on it as erase it.
In other words,

143
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:41,520
this was not meant to be a
record to be left for the future.

144
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,550
It was an accident.
These things that we discover,

145
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,810
these writings that we discover
we're meant as practical,

146
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:53,640
a practical usage in ways that I will
tell you about in a little while.

147
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:59,130
So anyway, that, uh, writing,
let me back up a step.

148
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:04,260
When Evans found writing at Kennesaw's,

149
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,230
he found two,
well he actually found seven,

150
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:11,790
but only two that turned out to
be significant to kinds of script.

151
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,140
I shouldn't even say script. That sounds
like he's writing a nice cursive line.

152
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,870
Two kinds of writing,
um,

153
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,970
one B because he couldn't figure out
what they were. He called one linear,

154
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,440
meaning it's a linear script,

155
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:30,950
a and linear B because he could tell
by careful analysis that they were,

156
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:36,380
they were different and he could tell
which pieces belonged to which linear Aa

157
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,990
is earlier and it is associated.

158
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:44,991
It is clearly the language used by the
my no and kings at Kennesaw state and

159
00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:47,100
other places.

160
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:52,730
Linear B resembles linear a but
it is clearly different and later.

161
00:11:53,531 --> 00:11:56,710
And one reason we know that we
know and mostly from stratigraphy,

162
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:01,450
but we can also tell because
it's a much simpler script,

163
00:12:01,451 --> 00:12:04,720
but by no means simple.
These are not alphabets.

164
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,360
These are silly berries.

165
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,250
Every symbol represents a syllable.
In other words,

166
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,860
typically two letters rather than one.

167
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,720
That's a nice step over having every uh,
uh,

168
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:24,190
having loads and loads and loads of
symbols representing lots of things,

169
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:28,120
which is true more of linear array
than linear B. But it's still,

170
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,070
we're talking about something
approaching 60 symbols in a silver berry.

171
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,710
And when you think about how hard it is
to learn to read when you're only using

172
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,910
26 symbols and how few
Americans do learn to read,

173
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,350
I keep reading in the paper.
Uh, it's not an easy thing.

174
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,320
It's not a simple matter.
Uh,

175
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,030
imagine what it would be like if you
had to learn about 60 such things. Well,

176
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:57,090
of course it follows from all of
that is ordinary people did not.

177
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,840
What we learn ultimately from the,
uh, our decipherment of Linear B,

178
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,070
which I've just skipped over,

179
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:08,310
which was done in the 1950s by a brilliant
young architect who loved solving

180
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:13,921
problems of this kind and was able to
discover that this was an early form of

181
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:21,301
Greek and that he could
essentially make out what it said.

182
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:26,890
At first there was doubt and controversy,
which has completely gone away.

183
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,720
As more and more examples of this
writing had become available.

184
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:34,810
And scholars are now able by enlarge,

185
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,920
to be confident that they
know what these things say.

186
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,600
So that the fact that this was a
Greek script that was available in the

187
00:13:45,761 --> 00:13:50,761
Mycenaean period tells us very confidently
that the Mycenaeans were Greeks,

188
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,990
but of course a lot was known about
these Mycenaeans well before the, uh,

189
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,090
the syllabary was, um, deciphered.

190
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:08,190
It's worth saying a word about that
because I want to undermine any great

191
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:12,670
confidence that you may have and what
you can believe that scholars tell you.

192
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:17,050
Because we keep finding out how wrong
we are about all kinds of things.

193
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,490
But I would say if you walked into
the leading universities in the world,

194
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:24,880
that would probably be
German in the 1850s,

195
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,170
and you went to the classics people,
uh, and you said, uh, well, you know,

196
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:33,860
homer wrote about these places and
my senior and other places, um,

197
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:37,600
can you tell me where that was?
And they said he was silly fellow.

198
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,250
That's just stories. That's
mythology. That's poetry.

199
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,970
There never was an Agamemnon.
They were never was a, my Sini.

200
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:51,190
There isn't any such
thing. Uh, and then, uh,

201
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,790
eight in 1870,

202
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,810
a German businessman by the
name of Heinrich Schliemann,

203
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,700
who had not had the benefit
of a university education
and didn't know what a

204
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:05,660
fool and how ignorant
he was a believe homer.

205
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,550
And he said he wanted to look for Troy.

206
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,360
So we went to where people
thought Troy might be. And uh,

207
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,350
he began digging there.
And before you know what he's discovered,

208
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:18,290
a mound filled with cities,

209
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,840
which he believed was Troy.

210
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,990
And after the usual amount
of scholarly debate,

211
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,990
that seems to be no doubt that it was,
uh,

212
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,480
the city of Troy.

213
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,730
So having succeeded with that, he
thought, well, now that I've seen Troy,

214
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:39,410
how about my Sini off he went to the
northeast pill and he says to the site

215
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,710
where he thought it might, it might be
my senior from Homer's account. And, uh,

216
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,540
I wouldn't be telling you this story
and you know, the outcome he founded,

217
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,860
uh,

218
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,570
and it was the excavation
of the site of my Sini,

219
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:57,950
which was soon followed by the excavation
of other sites from the same period

220
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:03,250
that made it possible for people to
talk about this culture even before they

221
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:06,560
could, uh, read the script.

222
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,910
The culture is marked by some
of the following features.

223
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:17,120
Let's, let's take my Sini,
which is a maybe the best
example of the whole culture.

224
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:21,080
Certainly it's the, it's, it's a perfect
model for what we're talking about.

225
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,740
What you have to begin with is a town or
a city or a settlement of some kind of

226
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,570
built on top of a hill.

227
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,760
And it's usually intended
to be a formidable hill.

228
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:39,790
One not easily accessible to anybody
who comes walking along a place.

229
00:16:40,611 --> 00:16:44,330
In other words, that would make
a very nice fort a citadel.

230
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,780
And that's indeed what
we find a at my Sini.

231
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,930
And on that citadel, on that strongly, uh,

232
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,190
rocky fort or,
or citadel vape,

233
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:59,870
they built what we now
identify as the royal palace,

234
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,440
the Palace of the king.
And,

235
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,260
uh,
that was,

236
00:17:06,261 --> 00:17:11,210
I should point out maybe
about 10 miles from the sea.

237
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,220
Now, not all Mycenaean sites
are so far from the sea.

238
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,020
Some of them are closer.

239
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:22,640
But what it's important to say is that
none of them are right on the sea.

240
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,970
They're always back, uh, some few miles.

241
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:30,980
The reason for that I think is that the
early times in which these civilizations

242
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:32,530
arose,
uh,

243
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:37,310
saw all kinds of dangers
coming and the most to swift,

244
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:37,551
this,

245
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:42,440
the least suspected the one that could
come upon you overnight came from the sea.

246
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,360
People who came by land.

247
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,540
You would be hearing rumblings about it
down the road from villages that were

248
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:53,200
spread out. But if somebody comes
in from the sea on a ship, uh,

249
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,560
you may find them there in the morning
and you don't know what's what.

250
00:17:55,561 --> 00:18:00,270
So the idea of, for security and safety,
they built their states far from the sea,

251
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:03,000
but not far.
Because as we shall see,

252
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,120
the Mycenaean civilization was a
commercial one that relied for its wealth,

253
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,730
uh,
upon trade.

254
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,140
And that meant a tr trade
by sea more than by land.

255
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:23,300
The citadel is typically he
always surrounded by farmland.

256
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,020
And that is of course,

257
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:33,021
you cannot live in ancient society if
you are not surrounded by farm land

258
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,290
because the,

259
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:40,490
the food that comes from the soil is
essential for life and you can't count on

260
00:18:43,351 --> 00:18:48,351
trade to provide it to you with any
security later on when times are more

261
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:51,570
secure, there's trade for grain
as well as for everything else.

262
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,700
But when you're settling a
place in the first place,

263
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:55,560
you can't rely on somebody
bringing it to you.

264
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,740
You're going to have to have your own
people working in and bringing it up to

265
00:18:58,741 --> 00:19:03,740
you themselves. So the
citadel and the farmland, uh,

266
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,470
surrounding it,
makeup fundamentally the unit,

267
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:12,270
which is the Mycenaean kingdom.
Well,

268
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,970
the first thing that a
slam on found when he, uh,

269
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:20,990
Doug at my CV was this
remarkable circle of graves,

270
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,400
which was shafts dug
straight down into the soil.

271
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,050
Uh, and they are referred to to this
day, technically a shaft graves.

272
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,250
And then in other places,
not very far from that main hill,

273
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,580
they found even more remarkable burials,

274
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,700
what we call beehive tombs.

275
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:46,701
Just imagine a huge beehive in which
let's say the center of the inside of that

276
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:53,660
might be as much as 50 feet high or more.
And uh,

277
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:58,730
these were built of extraordinarily huge
heavy stones and very well worked too.

278
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,390
And here's the marvelous thing.
He, the reason he had one cover,

279
00:20:06,391 --> 00:20:10,320
it was that these beehive tombs,
like everything else we're buried.

280
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,220
And this wasn't just the
result of centuries of neglect.

281
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,060
It is clear that they were
built in order to be buried.

282
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,220
That is to say the, uh, the, the,

283
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:25,650
it was some kind of a big religious
thing going on here where the king,

284
00:20:25,651 --> 00:20:29,610
it was obviously a royal up thing
because the cost of it was so enormous.

285
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:34,610
Nobody else could afford a tomb of that
kind so that he was a royal tomb closed

286
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:40,590
forever and yet built at a fantastic
expense in enormous kind of labor.

287
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:45,630
And the same is true in a general way of
what we find in the royal palace up on

288
00:20:45,631 --> 00:20:47,160
top of the hill at my Sini.

289
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:52,420
And so what is perfectly clear is the
people who ruled these places were

290
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:56,710
enormously powerful,
at least locally and wealthy.

291
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:00,400
Because even if the,
if you imagine that slaves did the work,

292
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,170
you would need a hell of a lot of them
over a long period of time and you had to

293
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:10,150
feed them, if nothing else. So that
we are talking about a wealthy group.

294
00:21:10,151 --> 00:21:14,020
And of course the other thing
that struck Schliemann, uh,

295
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:19,380
almost a amazingly was that in the
circle of graves that we've been talking

296
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:25,330
about, he found all kinds
of precious things buried,

297
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,440
the most striking of which were a death
masks made of pure gold on the remains

298
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:34,683
of the body,

299
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,720
but also Jules and implements
and weapons of very high expense.

300
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,880
That's what, of course, makes it clear
they were royal in their care by the way.

301
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:50,910
And there are only a few of these
graves over a large period of time.

302
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,640
So you must imagine these are successive
kings who are being buried in this,

303
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,500
what must have been sacred soil.

304
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,780
So that makes it clear.

305
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:09,010
We're talking about a wealthy,
a civilization,

306
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:14,260
at least in which the rulers are wealthy
and in which the rules of course are

307
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:15,430
very powerful.

308
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:21,270
Now what we learn both from archeology
and from a references in the linear B

309
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:28,660
tablets,
is that they engage these cultures,

310
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:33,190
invade it,
engaged in trade to a significant degree.

311
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:38,650
You Find Mycenaean elements, tools, other,

312
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,191
other thing,

313
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:44,191
pottery particularly of a certain kind
of all over the Mediterranean Sea.

314
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,440
You find it in datable, uh, places.

315
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:51,550
And that's why we can give this
some kind of date, such as in Egypt,

316
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,400
the Mycenaeans had
irregular trade with Egypt.

317
00:22:54,401 --> 00:22:59,260
You find Egyptian things in my
Sini and vice versa. Uh, and also,

318
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:03,490
uh, presumably, much of it must
have gone into Mesopotamia.

319
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,040
Some of it went all the way
to the western Mediterranean.

320
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,930
This was a civilization that
was not shut in on itself,

321
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,740
but was in touch with the
entire Mediterranean region.

322
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,590
The major thing they seem to be selling,

323
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:22,780
we're aromatic oils in little vials.

324
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,970
Think of them as well,

325
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:29,800
some combination of oil and perfume.

326
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,180
I better say something about
oil in the ancient world.

327
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:38,500
So you get a grip on what's
going on here. Uh, the ancients,

328
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,270
ancient Greeks had no soap.
Think about that for a moment.

329
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,820
That's a problem, isn't, uh,

330
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,250
and yet they wanted to get clean.

331
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:54,590
And so what the device
they used was to take oil,

332
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:58,490
typically olive oil,
spread it on themselves,

333
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,070
then get a scraper,
a metal scraper,

334
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,640
and scrape off the oil with it what was
underneath the oil and then finally take

335
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:13,020
their bath and they would
come and be clean. Um,

336
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:17,300
now, um, oil is a wonderful thing.

337
00:24:17,301 --> 00:24:20,870
Olive oil is a great thing
in certain forms. You eat it,

338
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,980
the olive itself, you use it
to cook with as oil. You eat.

339
00:24:24,981 --> 00:24:29,060
Some people just put oil on their
salad. I myself can't stand it. But uh,

340
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,840
but it important is it, it has to
take. But that's not all you've,

341
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:36,500
you'd get oil but crushed
the oil from the, the, uh,

342
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,000
olives that come down from the trees.
Uh,

343
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,870
that's a nasty smell that it has. So if
you're going to use it for this purpose,

344
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,660
it's not going to be good by itself.

345
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:52,690
You've got to put some nice perfume
onto it in order for it to be usable,

346
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,010
just as your soap would be pretty
horrible without any perfume on it.

347
00:24:58,011 --> 00:25:01,940
So, uh, it looks as though
what the Mycenaeans did.

348
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,150
Greece is filled with
wonderful olive trees,

349
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,520
and so they obviously took the,
uh, the oil from those olives.

350
00:25:10,521 --> 00:25:12,230
I'm sure they sold it in various forms,

351
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,530
but one of the most popular
was for this purpose.

352
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,260
Everybody in the Mediterranean
wanted it for the same reasons.

353
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:23,530
And obviously there's these Mycenaean
sites had access to what they needed.

354
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,940
It looks like, by the way, that the gut,

355
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:29,990
much of the perfume from
areas outside of Greece,

356
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,740
some of the best of it came from a
North East Africa as a matter of effect.

357
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:40,100
Uh, th th you remember the queen of
Sheba from the Bible? I say that,

358
00:25:40,101 --> 00:25:45,050
but I, I shutter to think how many of
you have read the Bible. But anyway,

359
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,093
um,

360
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:51,850
she was so rich as to attract the interest
of King Solomon because that's where

361
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:57,020
those wonderful, uh, find smelling things,

362
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,500
frankincense and myrrh and stuff like
that was available useful for this

363
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,450
purpose. So, um,

364
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,480
they had to import that to make their
goods as saleable as they wanted.

365
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,533
And so,

366
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:16,550
so you have trade with the Mediterranean
and most especially the eastern

367
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:20,150
Mediterranean because that's where
the older, more sophisticated,

368
00:26:20,151 --> 00:26:21,830
more civilized cultures were.

369
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,730
And that's where wealth was to compare
it to what was out in the West.

370
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,520
And so that's the pattern of trade.

371
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,830
And what you see is a
kind of cultural unity.

372
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,040
First of all,
within the Mycenaean world itself,

373
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:42,310
it is evident that these
different Mycenaean towns
all through the Greek on both

374
00:26:43,921 --> 00:26:44,430
sides

375
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,490
of the GNC, uh, we're in
touch with each other.

376
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:53,630
And one of the things that's interesting
about that is you can see a pottery

377
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:58,950
styles that you can hardly tell
whether they came from one end of the

378
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,590
Mediterranean or another if
they're of the Mycenaean variety.

379
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,670
Because it was a single culture.

380
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:11,040
I don't mean there were no
local variations, but there
was this general unity.

381
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:16,850
I'm going to contrast that with the
situation in Greece after the fall of the

382
00:27:16,981 --> 00:27:18,000
Mycenaean world.

383
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,930
And I was going to say not just
in the Mycenaean towns themselves,

384
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:26,931
but over the entire sea and indeed across
the Mediterranean in the years of the

385
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,970
Mycenaean period,

386
00:27:29,971 --> 00:27:33,810
roughly from 1600 to 1100 or so,

387
00:27:33,811 --> 00:27:38,811
BC you are dealing with a
largely unified culture.

388
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:45,210
What does it, um, what did we talk about
the world like these days? What's the,

389
00:27:45,211 --> 00:27:48,210
what's the cliche?
Globalized world?

390
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,410
It was a globalized world except there
was a little piece of the globe, but they,

391
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:56,490
they didn't really know or care about
very much outside of the Mediterranean

392
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,593
area.

393
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,870
Now in the respects that I have spelled
out and I mean chiefly the fact that

394
00:28:03,871 --> 00:28:06,470
they were engaged in
commerce and industry to,

395
00:28:06,471 --> 00:28:11,160
to some degree and that they were trading
peoples and that they were in touch

396
00:28:11,161 --> 00:28:14,730
with one another and so
on. And, uh, they were, uh,

397
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,880
already similar to the civilizations
that came before them in the ancient

398
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,990
Mediterranean near east,

399
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:28,010
in those places in Egypt to Pharaoh in
Mesopotamia at first individual city

400
00:28:30,511 --> 00:28:34,710
states were ruled in the
same way as everybody.

401
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:38,850
I'm going to be talking about
now by somebody who was a king,

402
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,253
a monarch,

403
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,400
a one man ruler who is the warlord,

404
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:52,790
the commander of the armies who has
the control of the power in the state.

405
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,040
But more than that,

406
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:02,870
all the economic activity that we find
in and our best example of what I'm about

407
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:09,951
to say is in Mesopotamia in the
cities of the Tigris Euphrates valley,

408
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:17,750
the ruler there from his palace assisted
by vast groups of bureaucrats directed

409
00:29:21,931 --> 00:29:26,460
the economy of his land
entirely and fully.

410
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:30,060
Agriculture was
overwhelmingly the activity,

411
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:34,770
the most important activity of the
people of that area of anyway area.

412
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,330
And so, um, we have
evidence that the king,

413
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,470
uh,

414
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:45,470
doled out seed for planting instructed
people just exactly when to plant,

415
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:52,780
where to plant, what to plant
there, when to fertilize it.

416
00:29:52,781 --> 00:29:55,120
If they did in Mesopotamia,

417
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:59,260
they usually didn't need to because
of the richness of the soil. Uh,

418
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,170
and so on.
In other words,

419
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,200
you have a degree of centralized control
of true monarchical power of a wealthy

420
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:14,440
monarchical power already
the model is there in Asia,

421
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,903
and again,
I keep,

422
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:20,440
I want to say it's the same but as
special way in Egypt because in Egypt,

423
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,390
the whole Nile Valley,

424
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:27,130
because I think of the nature of the
Nile Valley became totally centralized

425
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:31,180
under the rule of one man, the Pharaoh,
and he commanded the whole thing.

426
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,410
It took longer for anything like
that to happen in Mesopotamia,

427
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:39,670
although it ultimately did. When we
get, for instance, down to the 17,

428
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:44,380
about 1750 BC in Mesopotamia at Babylonia,
which is at that point,

429
00:30:44,381 --> 00:30:47,380
the dominant kingdom of the area,
uh,

430
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,440
King Hammurabi has just about the
same power as a a pharaoh would in,

431
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:54,943
in Egypt.

432
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:02,340
It's also worth pointing out that these
rulers had full religious authority for

433
00:31:08,351 --> 00:31:12,190
their rule. In the case of
the, the pharaohs of Egypt,

434
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,880
the Pharaoh was himself a god and
insisted on being worshiped in that way.

435
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,230
In Babylonia,
for instance.

436
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:27,340
And this I think was typical
Hammurabi was not a god,

437
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:32,590
but as we know, thank
God to uh, by the, uh,

438
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,920
the great steely that he left
that's now in the Louvre, the,

439
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:40,600
the law code of Hammurabi
is available to us.

440
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:41,434
And there's a,

441
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:47,910
a preface to it in which he basically
explains why should you obey the rules

442
00:31:49,181 --> 00:31:51,220
that I am now aligning
a laying down for you.

443
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:56,520
And his answer is because the top God of
our World Marduk up pointed me in that

444
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:04,780
space and I'm doing
what he wants me to do.

445
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:09,130
And if you cross me, you cross
him. And that's bad news.

446
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:13,080
That's a rough translation.
Um,

447
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,740
so, um, this is very important.

448
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:22,980
You have a full monarchy in the sense
that both we and America talk about the

449
00:32:25,901 --> 00:32:28,240
separation of church and state.

450
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:33,300
That is a very rare and unusual
thing in the history of the world.

451
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,430
The normal situation in cultures,

452
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,890
pre civilized and civilized as well,

453
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:44,290
is for there to be a unity between
religious things and a nonreligious things

454
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:52,930
and all of that to be ruled by a single
individual who is the monarch of that

455
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:59,351
territory with religious sanction as
well as through his power and through the

456
00:33:00,621 --> 00:33:02,450
legitimacy of his dissent.

457
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,840
That's the normal human way of living.

458
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,480
You should always be aware,

459
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:12,350
I think of about how peculiar we are.

460
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:18,190
We are the odd balls and the history of
the human race and anybody who follows

461
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:19,634
our pattern.

462
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:24,910
And it's important to realize that
because there's nothing inevitable about,

463
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,900
uh, the development that has come about
to be characteristic of the world.

464
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,480
And when we find people challenging it,

465
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:38,110
I think they have the bulk of time and
human experience on their side when they

466
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,960
say, you guys got it wrong. So

467
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,590
let me say something about the,

468
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
the nature of the society and economy
that we find in the Mycenaean world

469
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,760
revealed both by the archaeology and by
what we learned in the records provided

470
00:34:02,421 --> 00:34:07,280
by linear B, the remains in records
of these strongholds. Make it clear.

471
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:12,700
That's a political organization was
an imitation of oriental Monique,

472
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,650
the sovereignty of the sovereign
at my Sini rather, and a high loss.

473
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,190
Another important sites for
the period and at seeps,

474
00:34:22,191 --> 00:34:27,191
which was another one was somebody
that the tablets referred to as the one

475
00:34:27,201 --> 00:34:32,201
knocks and that is the same as a later
Greek word which drops the w at the

476
00:34:34,521 --> 00:34:38,090
beginning on ox and as we shall see,

477
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:43,120
that word in later times means
some powerful individual,

478
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:47,480
but it doesn't mean what it means here.
The boss,

479
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,770
the single monarchical
controller of everything,

480
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:57,140
he held a royal domain that
belong directly to him,

481
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,860
which was very significant
in size and wealth.

482
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,370
He appointed bureaucratic officials,

483
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:10,570
he commanded royal servants
and he recorded royal goods,

484
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,870
which by the way,

485
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:17,050
most of the tablets are inventories
lists of things that exist in the palace

486
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,760
that belonged to the king.

487
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,110
There were others things that have to
do with instructions that the king is

488
00:35:24,111 --> 00:35:26,390
sending out to people from the palace.

489
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:30,680
There was no reference
in any of the tablets.

490
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:34,160
I don't know how much we can make of that
because the tablet's limit themselves

491
00:35:34,161 --> 00:35:39,030
to such a limited kind of thing that
maybe it doesn't prove anything.

492
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:43,380
But in this case, I think it does.
Uh, there is no reference to law.

493
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:49,370
There is no reference to some objective
or anything other than the king himself

494
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,320
in the administration of justice.

495
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,730
One scholar says it is natural
to infer that's a king.

496
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:02,030
All powerful controller of the all
seeing bureaucracy possessed supreme

497
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:07,710
authority also in the region of
lawmaking and law enforcement.

498
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,380
And I'm the president.

499
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:15,381
Bureaucracy with it's detailed and all
encompassing records gives the clearest

500
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:20,631
picture of the power exercised by the
centralized monarchs of the Mycenaean Age.

501
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:27,500
The records discovered at Pi loss
here are particularly interesting.

502
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:32,601
They cover only one part of a year and
yet they carry details of thousands of

503
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:37,590
transactions in hundreds of places.

504
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,560
These files,
as we might call them,

505
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:45,360
are both sweepingly inclusive
and penetratingly minute.

506
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,613
For instance,

507
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:52,610
bronze is allocated to different places
for the manufacturer of arrowheads or

508
00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:58,641
sorts with a note telling how many smiths
in each place are active and how many

509
00:36:59,521 --> 00:37:03,960
are not.
Cretin sheep are enumerated,

510
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,150
uh, to the amount of 20,000
and sorry, that's not right.

511
00:37:09,151 --> 00:37:09,990
They don't want to get this wrong.

512
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:15,260
25,051 and we learned
that in a Cretin village,

513
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,310
two nurses,

514
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:21,320
one girl and one boy are employed.

515
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,610
We are told how much linen is
expected from a place called Rian.

516
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:31,560
What is the acreage of the
estate of a man called electron?

517
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:35,280
And what a guy named
Donius owes the palace.

518
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,060
The answer is 2100 liters of barley,

519
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,800
526 of olives for 68 of wine.

520
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:48,690
Hope you remembering all
this. 15 rams, one fat hog,

521
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,690
one cow and two bulls.

522
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:57,770
We even learned the names of two oxen
owned by [inaudible] glossy and Blackie.

523
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,060
The records make it perfectly clear
that the kingdom of pilots and Kinesis,

524
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:09,840
the kingdoms, we're bureaucratic
monarchies of a type unexpected in Greece,

525
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:14,970
but in many ways similar to some
contemporary and earlier kingdoms in the

526
00:38:14,971 --> 00:38:15,900
eastern Mediterranean.

527
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:21,680
It is very unlike anything we associate
with the Greeks or anything that ever

528
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:26,841
again existed in the Greek world and
that's really the point I want to make

529
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,170
this.

530
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:33,120
Although these people are Greeks are
ruling a culture which is thoroughly

531
00:38:33,121 --> 00:38:36,220
different from the one we will be
studying for the bulk of the semester.

532
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,710
So like the eastern states, you have
a powerful ruler who was a warlord.

533
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,980
There's a palace economy,
there is a script,

534
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:50,030
there is a bureaucracy and
there was collectivized
agriculture under the central

535
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,420
control of the economy.

536
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:59,670
That economy and that society
go forward and flourishes for,

537
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,080
as I say,
about 400 years,

538
00:39:02,081 --> 00:39:07,081
maybe perhaps about 400 years and then
a bunch of terrible things obviously

539
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,400
begin to happen that shake the security
of this society and ultimately bring it

540
00:39:16,031 --> 00:39:16,864
down.

541
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:21,460
Roughly speaking about 1200 BC,

542
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:27,930
we hear of general attacks that are
going on around the Mediterranean against

543
00:39:28,571 --> 00:39:33,571
the various civilizations of which we
know Egypt experiences a number of attacks

544
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,400
from the outside world.
Chiefly,

545
00:39:39,401 --> 00:39:44,401
what we hear about is from in the area
of the Nile Delta right there on the

546
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,290
Mediterranean Sea. Among those
attackers, there are others besides,

547
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:52,450
there are attackers from Libya.
We here,

548
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:55,510
but they're also attackers that
are simply called from the sea,

549
00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:00,660
the sea people attacking at the roughly
the same time the dominant empire in

550
00:40:02,561 --> 00:40:07,561
Asia Minor Anatolia is that run by a
people called the Hittites who have been

551
00:40:09,131 --> 00:40:13,900
there for hundreds of years,
insecurity and are now suffering assault.

552
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:18,230
We know that because they also
have a writing which we can, uh,

553
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:22,690
read and it speaks of it as well as
the archaeological remains that show

554
00:40:22,691 --> 00:40:27,480
destruction. Similarly
attacks are going on, uh,

555
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:32,550
against the kingdoms of
Syria and of Palestine,

556
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,960
which, uh, it can, I, you know,

557
00:40:34,961 --> 00:40:37,300
it's always hard to know what that
piece of land should be called at any

558
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:38,134
particular moment,

559
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:43,470
but I call it Palestine because one of
the sea peoples at attack denial in the

560
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:48,700
round 1200 neat in Egypt, uh,
are called the Pellis set.

561
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:54,240
And most scholars suggested that is the
same name as came to be the name for

562
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:58,630
this region when they
ruled it called Palestine.

563
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,110
And you will remember that when
the Bible talks about this,

564
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,960
it refers to a people
called the Philistines.

565
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:10,540
These are thought to be all the
same people. So since they ruled it,

566
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,050
until uh, uh, what's his name,

567
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:19,360
Samson took them out with
the jawbone of an ass.

568
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:26,230
Ma, I think it's proper to it
Palestine at that moment. Um,

569
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:31,290
Cypress likewise suffers
from these attacks and so
far west as Italy and Sicily

570
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,860
are under,
something

571
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,680
is going on.
The question of course,

572
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:41,710
is what scholars have disagreed and
continue to disagree because the evidence

573
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:47,180
simply will not permit
any confident a answer.

574
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:52,210
But I ought to just mention a few of the
theories that have been tossed around a

575
00:41:52,431 --> 00:41:57,350
few, among many, many, many,
one that seems to be in,

576
00:41:57,351 --> 00:41:59,360
in fashion these days,

577
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:04,540
although you never know how long the
fashion lasts is a internal uprisings that

578
00:42:07,521 --> 00:42:11,510
somehow these monarchical
areas when life got tough,

579
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,600
that people must have
risen up against them.

580
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:19,810
I think this reflects hopeful Marxists
wish fulfillment rather than any reality,

581
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:26,630
but it's not entire, well, that's not
what poor people have done in history.

582
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:28,160
If you look at revolutions,

583
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:32,180
revolutions come typically when things
are getting better and the people don't

584
00:42:32,181 --> 00:42:35,150
like the fact that they don't
have more than they already have.

585
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:40,370
But in any case that that's one
theory, earlier theories, uh,

586
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,230
it's wonderful to have a scientific
theories that you can use to handle these

587
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:49,130
problems, which you cannot
demonstrate any facts for whatsoever.

588
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,090
I'm being a bit strong,
but not too much. Uh,

589
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:58,120
the one theory made some investigations
of earth spores hoping to find a,

590
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:05,180
what do you call that? Stuff that floats
around and makes you sneeze. Pollen. Yeah.

591
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:09,470
And, uh, um, behind that as a result,

592
00:43:09,471 --> 00:43:13,520
they said there were droughts in these
areas throughout that period and that

593
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:15,890
caused tremendous
unhappiness and discontent,

594
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:21,080
deter other people have
suggested climatic shift.

595
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,490
I keep waiting for somebody that I think
the time is ripe for somebody to come

596
00:43:25,491 --> 00:43:30,470
up with theory and explain
it by global warming. Also,

597
00:43:30,471 --> 00:43:35,471
we know that the island in the middle
of the Aegean Sea called Theara,

598
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:42,620
uh,
blew up in the most enormous,

599
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:47,621
kind of an explosion at some point
back there in prehistoric days.

600
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:54,550
And one theory is it was the explosion
on Theara that caused so much climatic

601
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:59,450
trouble that, um, uh, it, it
can explain what went on here.

602
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:04,280
The trouble is you just don't know
when that explosion took place.

603
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:05,560
And since there are,
uh,

604
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:10,100
several periods in this general area
that we're talking about now in which

605
00:44:10,101 --> 00:44:14,360
something big happen, some
great change takes place. Uh,

606
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:18,380
it turns out different people want to
have their explosion at different times.

607
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,060
It's like a movable feast.

608
00:44:20,061 --> 00:44:23,330
You put your explosion where you
need it at any particular moment.

609
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:28,670
I am I making light of it
and I think it's, it's, it's
somewhat justified because,

610
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,850
uh, the evidence is
just so scanty. It just,

611
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,480
I think it's fun to play
the game these guys do,

612
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,960
but we shouldn't take it too seriously.

613
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:42,710
Now let's go back to a theory which has
at least got the virtue of being very

614
00:44:44,701 --> 00:44:48,660
old, although hardly
anybody believes it anymore.

615
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:54,110
That is the theory that what
happened in the Mycenaean world,

616
00:44:54,301 --> 00:44:56,430
let's forget what was happening elsewhere,

617
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:01,980
was the result of a movement of tribes,

618
00:45:01,981 --> 00:45:06,981
of ethnic groups who were outside the
Mediterranean region and say at the

619
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:14,151
beginning of this period and say
in 1600 but who press into it.

620
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:19,020
Usually the picture is if they are coming
from the north of the North East and

621
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:20,670
pressing down into it,

622
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:25,850
I have to believe that whoever came up
with that theory for the first time was

623
00:45:26,251 --> 00:45:31,050
aided and coming to it by thinking
about the end of the Roman empire when

624
00:45:31,051 --> 00:45:33,630
something precisely like that did happen.

625
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:38,930
These Germanic and other tribes who were
largely located north and northeast of

626
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,390
Europe came down.
Uh,

627
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:45,180
or I should say not on Europe of the
Roman Empire came down and ultimately

628
00:45:45,181 --> 00:45:48,330
destroyed it by invasion.
And even of course,

629
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:51,840
there are more theories about the fall
of the Roman Empire then there are about

630
00:45:51,841 --> 00:45:55,170
the fall of the Mycenaean world.
But anyway,

631
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:59,410
behind connected to all of this was a,

632
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,770
a very interesting Greek myth,

633
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:06,600
which speaks about the return
of the Harris [inaudible].

634
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,160
They are the sons of the mythical hero,
Herrick Herrick Lees,

635
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:15,510
who was a Peloponnesian figure. And, uh,

636
00:46:15,511 --> 00:46:20,511
the story goes that the
sons of [inaudible] were
expelled from the Peloponnesus

637
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:27,050
and then promised that they would come
back a hundred years later and conquer

638
00:46:27,991 --> 00:46:32,340
it. And so they did come back a
hundred years later and conquer it.

639
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,880
And since this is the link that explains
the old story since in historical Greek

640
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,580
Times,
let us say the fifth century BC,

641
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:50,870
the people who inhabited the Peloponnesus
were mainly speakers of the Greek

642
00:46:51,991 --> 00:46:54,690
dialect called dark.

643
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:01,410
It was thought that Harris, please, sons
and Harris please being Peloponnesians,

644
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,750
no doubt spoke dork too.

645
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:09,080
And so this was referred to as,
uh,

646
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:11,040
by scholars in the 19th century.

647
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:15,030
Not by the ancient Greeks
as a Dorian invasion.

648
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:18,660
In other words,
another kind of Greek,

649
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:24,020
the Greeks who lived in the area
before the fall of the Mycenaean world,

650
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:30,310
what would they call? Well, it
homework gives us several names

651
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,380
for them.
Three stick out for me.

652
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:36,520
The most common and the
most widely used was a kins.

653
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:41,650
Another one is Dan [inaudible]
and a third one is our jives.

654
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:45,850
Our drives comes from the fact that they
rule over the land of our gos in Greece.

655
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:47,171
Now,

656
00:47:47,171 --> 00:47:52,171
the one that has some clout
historically is Akins because in the uh,

657
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,740
uh,
records of the Hittite kings,

658
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,530
there are references to people.

659
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,890
Uh, I'm trying to think. I think they
are called. I want to get this right,

660
00:48:05,891 --> 00:48:07,240
but I don't remember what this is.

661
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:11,350
The Egyptian or the something like a high

662
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,210
wash off, unless that's
the Egyptian form. Anyway,

663
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:19,780
they are called by names.
That sounds something like that.

664
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:23,470
One among the Hittites
one among the Egyptians.

665
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,480
And it's so easy given the fact that,
uh,

666
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:31,560
the letter w dropped out of the Greek
language between the Mycenaean period and

667
00:48:31,601 --> 00:48:32,560
the classical period.

668
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:36,700
You could easily imagine that
these people were referred to them,

669
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,210
refer to themselves as a high.
Why?

670
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:45,520
And when the Dow drops out, they are a
high oil, which is what homer calls them.

671
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,450
And so the idea here is that,
um,

672
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:56,080
the original Greeks who came
in were what we call a Akins.

673
00:48:56,830 --> 00:49:00,310
And that when these disturbances came,

674
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:02,440
and if the Dorian theory is true,

675
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:07,180
Dorian's either kill them
all or dominated them,

676
00:49:07,181 --> 00:49:11,680
possibly into married with them,
but dominated them and washed away,

677
00:49:11,681 --> 00:49:16,681
wiped out the use of the akin language
and impose their own Dorian language upon

678
00:49:18,191 --> 00:49:23,191
it and supporting such an idea among
other things is that if you go to the

679
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:26,800
mountains in the center of
the g of the Peloponnesus,

680
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,660
where it's awfully hard to get to,
there is a region called,

681
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:35,830
uh, well actually beyond those
mountains on the northern shore, uh,

682
00:49:35,831 --> 00:49:39,790
is a place called a Kia
where the people are Akins.

683
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,890
And so the theory might be,
well,

684
00:49:41,891 --> 00:49:45,910
they were driven away from their old homes
in the southern Peloponnesus and went

685
00:49:45,911 --> 00:49:47,650
up to the northern Peloponnesus.

686
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:52,630
And then there are the people in the
mountains of our Katiya who also don't

687
00:49:52,631 --> 00:49:55,270
speak to doric language. And, uh,

688
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,760
maybe they were driven up there to escape.

689
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:01,400
So those are the things that
help people decide that, uh,

690
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:06,130
to Dorian's May really have been the
peep to sons of [inaudible] who actually

691
00:50:06,131 --> 00:50:07,790
invaded.
Uh,

692
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:12,990
and that what we find after the fall of
the Mycenaean world in Greece are some

693
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,250
of the following things,

694
00:50:15,251 --> 00:50:19,390
things that were not typically found
in the Mycenaean world. First of all,

695
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:23,470
iron weapons,
not bronze ones.

696
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:29,550
A kind of a pin used to hold your cloak
together called a fibula unknown in the

697
00:50:32,391 --> 00:50:33,440
previous period,

698
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:39,430
the building of buildings in the shape
of what the Greeks called a Mega Tron,

699
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:43,610
a rectangular center,
which has a hearth in it,

700
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:46,040
a front porch and a back porch,

701
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,480
which will be the style in which Greek
temples are built in the historical

702
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:55,481
period that appears for the first
time after the fall of the Mycenaeans.

703
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,010
We know that the Mycenaeans bury
their dead by inhumane option.

704
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,520
Those great tunes,
those great grave things,

705
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:08,270
and even the common people
outside them are buried in graves.

706
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,390
Whereas in a historical period,

707
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:16,190
these people were cremated
rather than buried,

708
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:22,400
uh, in, in the world of homer.
That's what we see. So the,

709
00:51:22,401 --> 00:51:23,234
uh,

710
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:28,270
idea that was put forward in 19th century
was that the Dorians who worry less

711
00:51:28,701 --> 00:51:31,220
civilized, tougher, meaner,

712
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,050
harder fighting people assisted by
the use of iron and in their weapons,

713
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:39,980
which is superior allegedly to the Browns,
uh,

714
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,800
came down,
defeated the Akins,

715
00:51:42,801 --> 00:51:46,520
impose themselves on them where they could
drove them away, where they couldn't,

716
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:51,820
and that explains how things went that
has been attacked and is largely not

717
00:51:52,911 --> 00:51:56,750
believed these days for a whole lot of
technical reasons that I don't want to

718
00:51:56,751 --> 00:51:58,550
trouble you with right now.

719
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:03,110
I do not think we can believe
that simple story as it stands,

720
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:08,110
it is too simple and there are too many
things that it doesn't account for and

721
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:13,150
there are too many things that
would suggest that it's not correct.

722
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:18,200
However, I am not sure there
is nothing in that story.

723
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:23,570
And here. I really am influenced
most strongly by my colleague,

724
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:28,820
uh, Professor Jerome Pollack
now retired, uh, who was, uh,

725
00:52:28,821 --> 00:52:29,654
our,
uh,

726
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:34,610
history of art and archeology guy who
has a notion that it's very nuanced and

727
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:36,890
sophisticated and it
appeals to me quite a lot.

728
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:42,990
He suggests that there were indeed Greek
tribes from the north who spoke Dorian

729
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:48,041
dialects who came down during this
period attempting to come into the,

730
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:49,280
uh,

731
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:54,280
richer and better settled world of the
Mycenaeans and they didn't come down and

732
00:52:55,251 --> 00:52:57,500
then go be away for a hundred
years and then come back.

733
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:02,710
But rather they came down in waves of
tribes and families and so on exerting

734
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:09,230
gradual pressure, pushing in when they
could retreating when they couldn't.

735
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:12,410
Uh, and so on. And for this,

736
00:53:12,411 --> 00:53:16,640
I think there's a very good it whether
or not you accept the dory and idea.

737
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:19,160
I think we need,
we should find attractive.

738
00:53:19,161 --> 00:53:22,760
The idea that if there
was an external invasion,

739
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:26,040
it came in this way over a period of time,

740
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:30,180
a century or two with
success and then retreat,

741
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:34,470
not to having success flight,
all that kind of stuff going on.

742
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:35,860
Uh wait,

743
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:40,710
because the Mycenaean centers all reveal
for that stretch of time that they're

744
00:53:40,711 --> 00:53:42,240
scared to,

745
00:53:42,241 --> 00:53:47,241
proof of it comes from strengthening
their already quite strong walls in almost

746
00:53:48,811 --> 00:53:50,220
all the sites that we see.

747
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:55,350
And also this is a very important fact
if you're expecting to be attacked and

748
00:53:55,351 --> 00:53:59,040
besieged as all these citadels
would be by an invader,

749
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,730
you want more than anything else,
a water supply,

750
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,880
but they didn't necessarily have good
water supplies in such circumstances.

751
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:13,290
And so we see the building of
water holders in these places.

752
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:16,680
There's a very striking one.
The next time you go to my Sini,

753
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:21,980
don't miss the cistern that was dug
in the mountains and the hillside,

754
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:25,260
uh,
within the walls at that period.

755
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,910
It's deep and you better take a
flashlight because it's as black as it can

756
00:54:29,911 --> 00:54:32,640
possibly be.
But they spent a lot of time,

757
00:54:32,641 --> 00:54:36,500
energy and money on being
sure that they would have a,

758
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:40,020
a supply of water to hold
them for a long siege.

759
00:54:40,021 --> 00:54:44,070
I think that indicates that
something of the kind is going on.

760
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:50,120
And then we see that when
this culture comes to an end,

761
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,010
it is accompanied by people fleeing,

762
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:56,520
getting away from the Mycenaean world.

763
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:59,220
Some of them go only so far is Athens,

764
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:03,270
which had the good fortune
somehow of not being destroyed.

765
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:07,410
One of the few important Mycenae
in places that is not destroyed.

766
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:11,490
So for some reason it was safe in
Athens and some fled to Athens.

767
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,020
Others had to keep going and settled
on the islands of the Aegean Sea.

768
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:21,590
For others it was necessary to go further
and to settle the west coast of Asia

769
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:22,170
Minor,

770
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:26,640
which indeed this is the great period of
Greek settlements on the west coast of

771
00:55:26,641 --> 00:55:27,474
Asia Minor.

772
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:33,080
And then it looks like there came a
moment where there was a final blow where

773
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:38,610
whatever was attempting to overthrow
these cities and this civilization

774
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:41,700
succeeding not the same in every place.

775
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:46,890
The fall of Pi loss is generally
thought to be around 1200 BC.

776
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,220
My CD itself,
maybe 50 years later and uh,

777
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:54,780
other places later than that.

778
00:55:55,230 --> 00:56:00,230
I think it's very important to notice
that some of these places that were big in

779
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:03,300
the Mycenaean world,

780
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:08,720
we're entirely abandoned and
not settled again by the Greeks.

781
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:13,020
Buried lost people didn't
even know where they were.

782
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:17,070
That's extraordinary.
That only happens when something very,

783
00:56:17,071 --> 00:56:21,540
very large drives people
away from an inhabited site.

784
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,180
And so here's where,
uh,

785
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:29,340
Jerry Pollack's analogy to the fall
of Rome seems so very appealing.

786
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:34,720
That is more or less what did
happen in the Roman world.

787
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:39,850
And I don't see anything that suggested
it couldn't happen in the Greek world at

788
00:56:39,851 --> 00:56:44,540
the time we're talking about,
I'm trying to figure out,

789
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,030
uh, we quit when tend to one. Right?

790
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:53,150
Right. Yeah. Okay. Um, now

791
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:58,490
I suppose the most important aspect of
all of this for our purposes are the

792
00:57:01,141 --> 00:57:04,830
results of all of this.
And they were tremendous.

793
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:11,240
You have the destruction completely
of the Mycenaean Bronze Age culture.

794
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,080
Greece never sees anything like it.
Again,

795
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:18,600
this is not the way it was
in the ancient near east.

796
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:23,700
This is not the way it wasn't Egypt.
There you see continuity for a very,

797
00:57:23,701 --> 00:57:28,380
very long time. The Greek world
has this tremendous discontinuity.

798
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:32,220
It's like the door slams and
you've got to go into a new room

799
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:36,960
among the things that
are lost for a long time.

800
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,960
There is writing,

801
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:46,440
there is no writing in Greece from,
let us say 1100 or so on

802
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:52,870
until the middle of the eighth
century BC rough date, seven 50.

803
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:58,520
And then the writing that they do have
is completely unrelated to the writing

804
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:03,240
that was lost. They get it from a
different place. The letters, the, this,

805
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:08,360
the design of the writing comes in fact
from Asia probably from almost certainly

806
00:58:10,681 --> 00:58:15,570
from Phoenicia, the land that
is now called Lebanon. And uh,

807
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:19,860
the language that was for that
script wasn't Semitic language.

808
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:25,020
Hebrew is close to what's going on there,
but they don't take the language.

809
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:30,410
They borrow the characters from what had
been already something quite close to

810
00:58:30,931 --> 00:58:35,430
an alphabet and had only
a relatively small number.

811
00:58:35,431 --> 00:58:38,460
I forget the exact number of the
ones in the Semitic alphabet, but we,

812
00:58:38,461 --> 00:58:43,320
you're talking about roughly 25. Do you
mean you're into the ball game for a,

813
00:58:43,321 --> 00:58:47,250
uh, an alphabet such as
ours? The Greeks borrow that.

814
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,190
But typical Greek, uh, innovation,

815
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:55,520
they do the big step of inventing vowels
so that now you don't have to remember

816
00:58:58,921 --> 00:58:59,341
anything.

817
00:58:59,341 --> 00:59:04,341
You can read every sound that is made
and they produced their alphabet,

818
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:08,370
but their alphabet has got
nothing to do with my [inaudible].

819
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,020
This is a new thing altogether.

820
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:14,460
The Greeks are totally illiterate
from around 1100 to seven 50.

821
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:20,570
Another characteristic of these years
between which scholars refer to as dark

822
00:59:21,561 --> 00:59:24,980
ages, just as they do the years
after the fall of the Roman empire.

823
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:26,960
Dark for two reasons.

824
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:31,070
Dark in the most obvious way
because we don't have any writing,

825
00:59:31,071 --> 00:59:34,610
no record of them.
We can't see it's dark.

826
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:39,470
The other dark in the sense of gloomy,
not good,

827
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:44,870
bad. This is a hard time with a poor
time, retro time, miserable time.

828
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:50,090
These are dark times. So that's
what is meant by the term dark ages.

829
00:59:50,091 --> 00:59:53,960
And that's what does follow the
fall of the Mycenaean world.

830
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:59,730
Part of the story is that
that old connection that
the Mycenaean world had with

831
00:59:59,731 --> 01:00:04,400
the Mediterranean in general, most
particularly with the east, uh,

832
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:05,300
stops.

833
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:11,500
We don't find in the excavations we
make of Greek towns in the dark ages,

834
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:16,640
we don't find implements
a Jewel's goodies,

835
01:00:16,641 --> 01:00:20,060
anything from Egypt and
Mesopotamia or anything like that.

836
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:25,550
It is clear and nor by the way do you
find Greek things in those places.

837
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:30,440
The Greeks are isolated
during this period. Of course,

838
01:00:30,441 --> 01:00:32,750
everything I'm saying
is somewhat exaggerated.

839
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,330
I'm sure there must have been
individual exceptions to everything,

840
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:39,110
but we're talking about
the overwhelming reality.

841
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:45,560
And not only are the Greeks as a whole
cutoff from the rest of the world,

842
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,720
but Greece itself,

843
01:00:47,721 --> 01:00:52,490
which used to be an area of easy exchange
where people could go from one place

844
01:00:52,491 --> 01:00:57,380
to the other end.
Did localism now comes into the picture.

845
01:00:57,650 --> 01:00:58,940
The unity is broken.

846
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:04,340
It's again like think I hope you know
something about the early Middle Ages

847
01:01:04,341 --> 01:01:09,341
where places where simply cut off one
from the other and there were no roads

848
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,930
kept or made.
Uh,

849
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:16,980
and just going from one village to
another was a strange and dangerous thing

850
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:22,040
because nobody was in charge.
Things were completely out of control.

851
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:25,340
That's the way things, clearly we're
in the Greek world. For instance,

852
01:01:25,341 --> 01:01:28,730
you can see pottery which
used to have this member,

853
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:30,470
this largely unitary quality.

854
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:35,690
You can tell if you're at all
experienced with it very easily. Uh,

855
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,180
if you'd go,
let's say to in a year 900 BC,

856
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:43,510
you can tell if a pot comes from Athens
or if it comes from Pi loss or pyloric

857
01:01:44,631 --> 01:01:48,290
may probably out of business teams to
someplace else because they have their

858
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:50,900
local characteristics which
are perfectly obvious,

859
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:53,720
which suggests that they're
not seeing each other's goods.

860
01:01:53,721 --> 01:01:54,680
They're not trading them.

861
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:59,780
They're simply working within
their own very narrow ambit.

862
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:03,110
That's the kind of a world
that is being created.

863
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:06,620
Something less easy to say confidently,

864
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:11,890
but probably clear I think is the whole
legacy of Mycenaean culture is really

865
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,540
lost.
Not fully though.

866
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:23,050
There is always something that we call
folk memory that has a recollection of

867
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:24,990
the distant past,

868
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:30,380
which may have truth to it but may not
or it may have only an element of truth

869
01:02:30,811 --> 01:02:32,580
to it and it's always very hard.

870
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:35,790
What comes back in this form
is usually what we call legend.

871
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:41,250
And anybody who reject rejects legend
across the board as simply being invention

872
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:42,690
is just dead wrong.

873
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:46,830
Anybody who tries to use it as an accurate
account of what really happened is no

874
01:02:46,831 --> 01:02:51,630
less wrong. Someplace in the middle is
where the truth is and it's hard to find.

875
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:53,611
But in any case,

876
01:02:53,611 --> 01:02:58,611
what we find are a number
of units in the Greek world,

877
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:02,970
call them towns for the sake of argument.
It sounds too urban,

878
01:03:02,971 --> 01:03:05,850
but call them that small.

879
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:09,720
That means to say smallest extent,
few people,

880
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:15,260
crystal population surely went down
since the capacity to grow food to

881
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:17,580
distributed that whole system,

882
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:22,290
that dependent on the existence of a
central palace and a strong king running

883
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:26,820
everything, running production, running
distribution, it's gone. And you know,

884
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:30,480
that doesn't come back when that's
destroyed, you're in terrible shape.

885
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:33,780
So the uh,
uh,

886
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:38,760
the population surely dropped and all
the evidence we have supports that.

887
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:43,860
So what you have are these small,
poor,

888
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:49,610
weak units and that's a miserable
situation and now they have no choice.

889
01:03:53,550 --> 01:03:56,460
They cannot rely as human
beings typically do.

890
01:03:57,390 --> 01:04:00,090
On just doing what your parents did.

891
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:05,340
Just inheriting a tradition
that functions, that works,

892
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:07,830
that keeps you going.
He couldn't do it.

893
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:13,140
The survivors had to figure out a new
way to do things and they didn't do

894
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:16,380
anything new in a hurry is all came hard.

895
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:20,280
And at the cost I'm sure have a lot
of human life and a lot of misery.

896
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:24,810
But what comes out of it is something
different. Now. I jumped though.

897
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:28,330
We do know that certain memories lasted.
They,

898
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:31,260
the Greeks always thought
there was an earlier age.

899
01:04:31,261 --> 01:04:35,490
The Greeks of the classical period always
thought there was an earlier age that

900
01:04:35,491 --> 01:04:39,180
was much better than the
age in which they lived.

901
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:43,740
An Age in which men were heroes.
They were bigger,

902
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:47,490
they were stronger, they were
tougher, they were faster,

903
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:50,430
they were more beautiful,
they lived longer.

904
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:56,160
Those were the great old days. And then
there's us, we pour miserable wretches.

905
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:01,350
That's the picture that the
Greeks carried with them. Uh,

906
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:06,210
the legends, just stories from
generation to generation, changed,

907
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:11,040
molded, but nonetheless retaining certain
elements of the earlier tradition.

908
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:17,530
And then finally we,
we have to believe that there's no it,

909
01:05:17,531 --> 01:05:22,090
I think that there was another
thing that provided for memory,

910
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:27,040
something we call the epic tradition.
When we get to homer,

911
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:32,110
we will find a highly
developed epic poetry.

912
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:36,780
And once we come to grips
with the fact that it was, uh,

913
01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:40,000
orally composed and recollected poetry,

914
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,900
then you'll get some idea of the length
of time that must have been involved in

915
01:05:43,901 --> 01:05:46,900
the creating of it.
And once we'll turn to this,

916
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,610
when we get to the Homeric issues,

917
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:54,630
once you realize that there are clearly
accurate depictions of aspects of the

918
01:05:56,501 --> 01:05:59,800
Mycenaean world that
show up in those poems,

919
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:03,070
which appeared to have been
written down for the first time,

920
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:06,730
perhaps around seven 50 BC or so,

921
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:11,350
then you must realize there had to be
an epic tradition of poetic tradition at

922
01:06:11,351 --> 01:06:15,640
the same time that goes back all the way
to the metal, to the Mycenaean period.

923
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:21,090
And I think we must remember that there
were people creating and repeating and,

924
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:26,120
and working out and changing a poetic
tradition that started in the Mycenaean

925
01:06:28,601 --> 01:06:32,020
world and lasted for the
rest of Greek history.

926
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:38,580
Now the legacy from the Mycenaeans to
Greek civilization later is very limited.

927
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:46,710
But what there is is very important and
no part of it is more important than the

928
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:49,720
Homeric poems themselves.

929
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,870
But if we look at the
society that emerges,

930
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,850
this dark age society that emerges
from the ancient world of my Sini,

931
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:03,280
what'd you have as a rare human
experience? The creation, all,

932
01:07:03,281 --> 01:07:06,130
most of a clean slate,

933
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:09,280
even more so,

934
01:07:09,281 --> 01:07:14,281
I would argue then the disruption
that it came after the fall of Rome,

935
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,450
because there's one big difference.

936
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:21,340
The fall of Rome did not destroy
one of the most important,

937
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:26,590
tenacious and significant
aspects of the old culture.

938
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:28,420
The Roman Catholic Church,

939
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,620
which remained and became a
central fact for the new culture.

940
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:35,050
There's nothing like that
in the Mycenaean world.

941
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:39,370
We are really talking about something
that's almost entirely fresh.

942
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:44,020
The Greeks had no choice but
to try to find their own way.

943
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:49,380
Uninfluenced as my Sini was influenced
by Mesopotamia and Egypt uninfluenced by

944
01:07:51,011 --> 01:07:56,011
anything starting from the lowest possible
place and having to make a living and

945
01:07:58,571 --> 01:08:03,010
to go forward and to shape
a world which was their own,

946
01:08:03,011 --> 01:08:05,200
because there wasn't
anything else to guide them.

947
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:09,580
Next time we'll take a look at the
dark ages and the world of homer.
