1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:06,440
The period in which the Greek pulleys
were left essentially to their own

2
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:08,364
devices,

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,330
came to an end with the clash
between the Persian empire and,

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,990
uh, that some of the Greek city
states, uh, but which came to involve,

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,290
uh,

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:27,250
Athens at the famous battle
of marathon in four 19.

7
00:00:27,251 --> 00:00:29,660
And I'd like to tell you today about the,

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,740
the rise of the Persian empire and it's
conflict with the Greek st concluding

9
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:37,560
with the account of that battle.

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,340
The Persians, uh, first
some terminology, uh,

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,660
the Persians were what the, uh,
thanks very much. Well, what the, um,

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,570
the Greeks called them
and that was appropriate.

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,020
They were very close cousins
of the people who lived,

14
00:00:57,531 --> 00:01:01,830
uh, right next to them or among
them called the Medes. In fact,

15
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:05,110
the Medes where the first
of that group of, uh,

16
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:10,230
I guess we could call
them, um, Arion people's.

17
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:15,170
Again, that's a term
that has been abused, uh,

18
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,760
throughout the 19th and 20th century.

19
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,640
Applying to as though
it was a racial group.

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,880
The term is a linguistic one,

21
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,830
and they spoke a branch of the
Indo European family of languages,

22
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:32,160
which is designated as Arion.
Uh,

23
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,960
and that's all that really means, but
they're very, very close. In fact,

24
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,890
the Greeks really couldn't distinguish
between the Persians and the errands and

25
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:45,360
so,
um,

26
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,110
they call them sometimes needs in some
time between the Medes and the Persians,

27
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:52,650
I mean, and sometimes they call them means
and sometimes they call them Persians.

28
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,950
It really doesn't matter because although
the Medes took the lead in forming a

29
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:03,081
national kingdom out of a tribal society
and we're the first to be the dominant

30
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:10,341
family on the Iranian plateau where
these people finally settled down,

31
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,760
the Persians then overthrew
them and establish themselves
as the ruling group in

32
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:23,931
that family under Cyrus the great as
he was called back probably in five 59,

33
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,150
he was called Cyrus the great
because he was a great conqueror.

34
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,140
First making his tribal associates,
the Persians,

35
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:36,360
the dominant force in Iran,

36
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,720
and then expanding the extent and the
power of what we can now call the Persian

37
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:46,770
empire and extraordinary distance.

38
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,580
If we look at the end of the lifetime
of Cyrus one man's lifetime is when this

39
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:58,170
extraordinary expansion, much
of it, most of it takes place.

40
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,080
If you look at the Near
East in the year five 50 BC,

41
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,190
what you find is the Kingdom of media,

42
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,970
the Kingdom of Babylonia,

43
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:17,710
which is the most powerful one
in the Tigris, Euphrates valley,

44
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,880
what is now Iraq,

45
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:24,630
the Kingdom of Lydia occupying sort
of the western portion of Asia minor

46
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,880
excluding at first the coast,
which was occupied by Greeks,

47
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:35,160
but which the Lydians then
conquer the Greeks, uh,

48
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,220
in the five forties, um,
that, but that's the picture.

49
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,830
And then there is the,

50
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,950
the people of Persia, the Persians
themselves who are of not much account.

51
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,760
But when Cyrus becomes king in five 59,

52
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,730
he is a member of the dynasty,

53
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,910
which is the [inaudible] dynasty.

54
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:03,510
And he conquers his fellow Aryans the
needs and about five 15 and very swiftly

55
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:09,610
conquers Babylonia. Armenia, Syria,

56
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,230
Kappa Dosha, which is another
kingdom in Central Asia Minor,

57
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,341
uh,

58
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:20,341
and has already expanded this a kingdom
to something pretty much unexampled up

59
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:24,520
to that time.
Now.

60
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,100
Meanwhile in Lydia,

61
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,470
the dynasty that began back in the seventh
century finds that the king creases

62
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,970
is the monarch in the, at that point, uh,

63
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,520
you will have remembered of course,
that Hurghada is his first book,

64
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,880
pretty much begins its story with a King
creases and his decision to attack the

65
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:53,230
Persian empire,
which is now on his frontier,

66
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,550
a new old member. The story
that Herat Herat, it just tells.

67
00:04:57,551 --> 00:05:01,690
So charmingly the,
a story of how it increases,

68
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,540
decides he wants to
conquer the Persian empire.

69
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,050
Consults the article of Apollo at Delphi
to see how he's going to make out the

70
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:11,950
article gives a characteristically
enigmatic answer,

71
00:05:11,951 --> 00:05:15,400
but he doesn't recognize the
enigma, the answer. He says,

72
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:20,280
what will happen if I crossed the Halley's
river? That's the boundary between, uh,

73
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,100
uh, Lydia, which had been, I'm sorry,

74
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,730
between Lydia and the Persian territory,
uh,

75
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,050
the article answers a great
empire will be destroyed.

76
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,760
And of course he had in mind
destroying the Persian empire. Instead,

77
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:40,670
the person's destroyed his empire.
And of course that shows you,

78
00:05:40,671 --> 00:05:43,900
you've got to ask the right question and
keep answering until you get an answer.

79
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:47,940
You understand? Well, um,

80
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,900
quizzes, attacks, uh, in five 47,

81
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,590
his capital of Sardis falls into the
hands of the Persians in the next year.

82
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,630
And so now the Persians are in
control of the Lydian Empire.

83
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:04,870
And uh, in, uh,

84
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:09,620
on the frontiers of the Greek
cities on the coast of Asia Minor.

85
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,390
And the conquest of those
cities takes place in the years.

86
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:16,850
Five 46 to five 39,

87
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,440
five 39 is a very big year for
the Persians because in that year,

88
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,620
they conquer the city of Babylon
and thereby gained control of all of

89
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,400
Mesopotamia.

90
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,630
Another one of the major
expansions of this vast empire,

91
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,610
the successor to,
uh,

92
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,800
Cyrus is a cam by cs.

93
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,950
And in the years between
five 30 and five 22,

94
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,520
he conquers amazingly
enough the Kingdom of Egypt,

95
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,530
perhaps the oldest,

96
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:56,480
but certainly if not almost the
oldest of the kingdoms of that region,

97
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,690
fantastically wealthy
and in its own right,

98
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,870
formerly a great empire.
Now,

99
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,610
if you stop in five 22,
when cam by sees dies,

100
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,420
you see that the Persian empire extends
on the West from the Aegean Sea and the

101
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:16,910
Mediterranean Sea.

102
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,910
To the West all the way to the
Indus River in what is now Pakistan.

103
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:28,040
And I'm from the south to really to,

104
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:28,874
um,

105
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:34,390
what is now Sudan at the southern end of
the Nile river and up north to include

106
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:44,960
the European coast of the Hellespont
and the region and the waters that the

107
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:49,880
straights and the
European coast of the GNC.

108
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,283
And,
um,

109
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,530
he comes right up as far as the Danube
River and nor is that the end of what he

110
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:02,120
would like to do,
can buy these launches,

111
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:06,470
an invasion of the
territory beyond the Danube,

112
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,240
which was not in the,

113
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:11,990
in the shape of any kind
of a national kingdom yet.

114
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,230
Just an area filled with
different kinds of tribes,

115
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:20,260
which the Greeks called Scythians
pushing all the way back into Russia,

116
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,550
all the way back to the Caucasus
mountains and perhaps beyond these,

117
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:30,360
um, uh, horse riding, um,

118
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:35,410
tribal people called the Scythians who
didn't even really engage in agriculture.

119
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,670
But we're still in the business of,

120
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,330
of living off a herds of animals.

121
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:47,540
Well, the, uh, the
expedition goes forward.

122
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,530
It ends up gaining the straits and
massive don, as I told you before,

123
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,310
or I should have told you
those names. Anyway. Um,

124
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:00,350
the story is told that one of the generals
of the Persian army is a certain mill

125
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,920
tighties mill.
Tyrese was originally an Athenian,

126
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,710
but his family had been expelled.

127
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,120
And the time of the time I'll rather
they had been sent to govern the

128
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,740
Gallipoli's peninsula,

129
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,830
the Thracian curse Denise as
the Greeks called it. And uh,

130
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,560
so he lived up there and then when the
Persians came and took that territory,

131
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:27,390
he became a subject of the great king
and he became a general in the great

132
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:28,171
king's army.

133
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:33,110
He and some others were given the task
of guarding the bridges across the Danube

134
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,530
while the king was chasing,
assessing Ian's on the other side.

135
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:42,990
Well, he was unable to defeat the
Scythians who used Scythian tactics,

136
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:46,050
which is to say on cavalry,
stayed away,

137
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:50,910
avoided a direct conflict,
and did damage, um,

138
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:56,150
with missiles at a distance and
ran away when they couldn't,

139
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,600
uh, when they were about to
face a great Persian army,

140
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:01,710
which could defeat them.

141
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:07,200
So he was gone a long time and
while he was gone, no tidy,

142
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:09,120
said he'll never come back.

143
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,950
Why don't we just break down these bridges
to make sure we never gets back and

144
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:18,660
then we'll be free of the Persians. Well,
it didn't work out that way. And the, uh,

145
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,020
the city,
Mississippi and campaign didn't succeed,

146
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:27,021
but the Persian army came back and a
mill tighties had to run off and escape

147
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,910
because there was certainly a price on
his head and he ended up going back to

148
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:35,940
Athens where we will run into him again.

149
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,330
So,
um,

150
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,660
that is the situation when we get
to the turn of the fifth century.

151
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,050
The Persians are in control.

152
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,080
They have gained mastery of all
the Greek states of Asia Minor.

153
00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:00,290
The typical relationship between those
cities and the king of Persia was the

154
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:02,250
same as all of his subjects.

155
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:07,580
He insisted in every case that the
defeated states who came under his power

156
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:14,601
should give earth and water to him as a
symbol of their complete subjection to

157
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:16,554
him.

158
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:21,240
There was no kind of relationship to
the great king except of one of complete

159
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:22,530
subject subjugation.

160
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,090
The Greeks regarded that
relationship as one of slavery.

161
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,900
Um, but as a matter of fact, the Persians
were not harsh rulers for the most part.

162
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,200
All they required of the subject peoples
was that they should pay a tribute to

163
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:43,140
the king. And it was obviously
not one that couldn't be met.

164
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,030
Obviously nobody likes to
pay a tax, especially to a
foreign conqueror. But, uh,

165
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,300
it wasn't something that,
uh,

166
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:54,410
destroyed the economy and to do military
or naval service at his command and

167
00:11:56,381 --> 00:12:00,190
under his command as well.
So those,

168
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,860
if you did that,
they left too long

169
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,270
at this point of the,
um,

170
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:11,430
the characteristic regime was to
have a tyranny appointed by the,

171
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,090
the great king of Persia in each
Greek city. But you should remember,

172
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,960
I use that word and its original concept.
It doesn't mean they were harsh.

173
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:24,760
It doesn't mean they were particularly
cruel. They were the satraps,

174
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,210
the representatives of
the king in that region,

175
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:30,910
and they had absolute control. But, uh,

176
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,960
we don't hear about any specially
harsh treatment of anybody.

177
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:40,260
That's the situation when we will come
very shortly to the beginning of conflict

178
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:46,711
between the Greeks of the mainland
and the Persian empire when the Ionian

179
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:50,980
rebellion breaks out.
But before that happens,

180
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:53,470
we need to go back to Greece
and see what's going on there.

181
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,990
[inaudible] remember in Athens,

182
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,310
the Cli Stenek Revolution has taken place.

183
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,540
The new hoplite democracy that I have
described to you is brand new and very

184
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:10,780
insecure,

185
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,790
fearful that there are enemies within.

186
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:21,130
Some of them are friends
of the, uh, uh, the,

187
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:21,964
um,

188
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:27,030
Arab Socratic families that have been
defeated and fled some of them friends,

189
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,470
relatives of the tyrants whose loyalty
to the new regime is not clear.

190
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,740
So that's one fear.

191
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:41,100
Another fear is that the Spartans will
not accept their expulsion and the

192
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,750
expulsion of their friends.

193
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,680
But we'll come back again with an army
to try to conquer Athens and turn it over

194
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:50,380
to the rest of Kratz.
And yet a third problem,

195
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,290
Athenian neighbors with whom the Athenians
have old quarrels may take advantage

196
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:01,450
of their beleaguered situation and attack
them. So that's has to be remembered.

197
00:14:01,451 --> 00:14:05,380
Athens is in a very insecure spot.

198
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,910
And Herodotus tells us,
excuse me,

199
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,210
that in these circumstances,

200
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:18,930
the Athenians attempt to get help by
sending a mission to the king of Persia,

201
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:26,010
asking for an alliance with Persia as
a way of fending off these troubles.

202
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:32,490
And of course the king only knows
one relationship with other states.

203
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:36,650
He doesn't know anything about
alliances that have any, uh,

204
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,650
equality associated with them.
He asks the ambassadors of the Greeks,

205
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:47,260
sorry, of Athens to give him earth and
water and then they can be friends.

206
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,350
Uh, the ambassadors say,
okay, we'll do that.

207
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,230
But when they come back to Athens,

208
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,360
the Athenians are outraged
that they have done so.

209
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:01,870
They punish the embassy and there is
no relationship between Persia and the

210
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:06,890
Athenians and indeed what
they feared it happens.

211
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:12,200
The Spartans invade Attica.
And as they are doing that,

212
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:17,150
they are joined by other states who
have their own grievances with Attica,

213
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,650
be Osha,
led by thieves.

214
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,100
CALC II switches the city and you'll
be here just to the east of Attica and

215
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:28,490
current just down the
road on the [inaudible],

216
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,960
they are all going to
attack the Athenians.

217
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:37,961
But it turns out that the
Corinthians Balk at this,

218
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,790
uh,
idea.

219
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:45,820
And what they don't like they say is
the notion of installing some kind of a

220
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:51,020
tyranny in Athens.
They have had the experience of tyranny.

221
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,530
They have expelled the type
activity not so very long ago.

222
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,020
They claim and they are not about to,
uh,

223
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,410
join anybody in doing the same thing.

224
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,970
So that's one source of,
um,

225
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,870
division that prevents this coalition
from attacking the Athenians.

226
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:14,110
But there's also a quarrel between the
two spartan kings Coriani's who has been

227
00:16:14,481 --> 00:16:19,180
there before and who very much wants to
take Athens in maternity to his arrows,

228
00:16:19,181 --> 00:16:24,181
Socratic friends and kingdom or
[inaudible] who for whatever reason is not

229
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:29,591
willing to do that demo rate as loses
the argument he is finally charges are

230
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:31,760
brought against them and he flees.

231
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,970
And next we will find them demo radius
in the Persian empire at the elbow,

232
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:41,630
sometimes of the king and uh,

233
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,620
giving him advice as to how
to deal with the situation.

234
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,640
Well, because of these
things, there is no invasion.

235
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,780
The Athenians are now free
to turn against the other.

236
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,020
They're neighbors who have
threatened them against the B ocean.

237
00:16:57,021 --> 00:17:02,021
City's led by thieves against cal keys
and the Athenians defeat their opponents

238
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,880
in cal keys on the island of Euboea,

239
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,120
the Athenians take away a chunk of land
from the child Citians and plant 4,000

240
00:17:15,021 --> 00:17:18,260
Athenian settlers on that land.

241
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,880
And they do so not as a colony
in the traditional sense,

242
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:27,840
not as an appboy Kia,
but as what the Greeks call a clearer key,

243
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,180
which is this,

244
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:33,980
these 4,000 Athenians who take
the land settle there permanently,

245
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,230
but they remain Athenians.
They are still Athenian citizens.

246
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:44,230
They are really functioning as an Athenian
garrison to see to it that things in

247
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,720
Biasha are okay in this way.

248
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:52,050
They very closely resembled
the Roman idea of a colony,

249
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,640
which was typically typically a
collection of veterans after putting after

250
00:17:56,641 --> 00:18:01,590
conquering some other town in Italy,
they would take some of that land,

251
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:06,060
give it to Roman legionaries and let
them settled permanently there as a

252
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:10,260
garrison on behalf of the Romans.
Well, that's what the Athenians do.

253
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,320
In the case of, uh, uh, calculus

254
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:19,990
orotic this sort of sings in Aria at this
point about the wonders of freedom in

255
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:25,710
which he says the Athenians were no
better than any other Greeks at warfare

256
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,560
before they became free.

257
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,300
But once having liberated themselves
from tyranny and establishing this new

258
00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:34,650
Kleist Stenek regime,

259
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,970
they were able to defeat
all of their opponents.

260
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:44,250
And so, uh, so much for the erotic,
this is prejudice. But of course,

261
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,970
as you read his sister, you will
realize that in, in one sense,

262
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:50,400
at least the,
uh,

263
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,320
the history of Hurghada is a on to the,
uh,

264
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,240
the wonders of freedom and the greatness
of freedom and this and [inaudible] of

265
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:03,540
freedom as the story of the Greeks.

266
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,840
Um,
by the way,

267
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:11,190
he also praises not just freedom
Eleuthera Rhea is the Greek word,

268
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,720
but in the case of Athens,
he praises it's east say goal Rhea.

269
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,780
That word really means equality of speech.

270
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:27,270
He characterizes this new class, authentic
regime, not by the word democracy,

271
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:29,310
which is apparently not
really been coined yet,

272
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:35,180
but rather as what characterize
it is that all citizens are free,

273
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:41,810
equally able to address the populace
in the assembly and thereby the take an

274
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:47,580
active role in their own government.
So he's really praising autonomy,

275
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:52,830
self-government,
not merely freedom from an alien people,

276
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,940
but freedom within the city for all
the people to govern themselves.

277
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,530
He thinks that's one of the reasons why
the Athenians have become so good at

278
00:20:01,531 --> 00:20:05,250
warfare because of these changes.
Now,

279
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:10,251
a new coalition emerges also
hostile to this new Athenian regime.

280
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:15,630
It includes Athens old enemy,
the island of [inaudible],

281
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,170
which sits in the,
uh,

282
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:23,430
ceramic Gulf right opposite
the Athenian coast. Um,

283
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,590
and it, it has, as I say,

284
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:29,850
they have been fighting each other now
for more than a century and quarreling

285
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:31,720
about this and that.
So the,

286
00:20:31,721 --> 00:20:36,721
each and Eton's join with the Spartans
and now they are openly attempting to

287
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,940
destroy this regime and to replace it
with a return to the tyranny of hippies.

288
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:52,290
Hippiest has also fled to the Persians
and is protected by the king so that you

289
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:57,530
have the notion of having,
um,

290
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:02,350
even if the Persians get involved,
they too, and they will get involved.

291
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,810
We'll want to put hippiest
on the throne in Athens,

292
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:08,620
but the Spartans want to do the same
thing. And again, the Corinthians,

293
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,430
we'll have none of that because
of their attitude towards chairmen

294
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,050
now threatened even more severely,

295
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:23,610
the Athenians send a second mission to
Persia and this time the Persian king

296
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:31,651
makes it very clear that will require
that the Athenians put down their newly

297
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:37,471
established democracy and restore
hippiest to his tyranny in Athens,

298
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,520
which would make Athens like
the other Greek city states,

299
00:21:42,521 --> 00:21:45,970
the ones that are on the
coast of Asia Minor, uh,

300
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
part of the Persian empire and hippiest
in his relationship to pressure would be

301
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:56,710
the sand trap of the great
king governing his own city,

302
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:01,740
which was I think commonly what was
happening in Asia minor on the Greek coast

303
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:05,080
too.
That's where we are.

304
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:11,130
When the Ionian rebellion
breaks out in the year for 99,

305
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:19,180
the start comes in the city of my Litas,

306
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,240
which was of course a leading city of
the Greeks of that area for some long

307
00:22:25,031 --> 00:22:25,864
time,

308
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:31,230
a place you will remember that was
filled with new ideas where we first hear

309
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:36,340
about the kinds of quasars scientific.
But in any case,

310
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:41,550
rationalistic revolution that challenges
the traditional Greek way of thinking

311
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:47,071
based largely on mythology and
on theology with pure reason.

312
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:54,280
I don't want to suggest that the my
legion philosophers were without religion.

313
00:22:54,281 --> 00:22:59,281
I'm simply saying they were introducing
something new that stands on the side of

314
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:04,300
religion and when it comes to their
attempt to explain what they are trying to

315
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:07,480
explain the physical universe,
for the most part,

316
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:13,140
it really does put aside religious
concepts and replace them with observation

317
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:17,320
and reason as the way to do things.

318
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,640
So what we are seeing of course in
my latest is the birth of philosophy.

319
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:26,710
At the same time as we are seeing
the birth of, um, natural science.

320
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:30,430
And these do not get separated until many,
many,

321
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:33,310
many years later on.
They are together.

322
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,630
That's the city where the
rebellion starts, has nothing
to do with philosophers.

323
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:42,430
It has to do with the tyrant of my
leaders and my lesion by the name of Eris

324
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:46,730
taggers who gets into
trouble with the great king.

325
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:52,060
He has talked the great king
into an expedition that he
wanted to launch against

326
00:23:53,271 --> 00:23:56,540
the island of neck
sauce in the Aegean Sea.

327
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:01,610
He says his knack sauce is a cinch. It's
a nice fat place. They're not ready.

328
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,800
If we sail now secretly I'll be able to
quickly take the island and the great

329
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:11,420
king. We'll have another, um,
uh, expansion of his empire.

330
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,231
And of course,

331
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:17,231
Arrowstar rigorous would benefit both
financially and also by the presumed honor

332
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:22,560
that he would gain from the great
king. Unfortunately, uh, they're,

333
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:26,700
um, intelligence per, it's the secure,

334
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:31,950
the security procedures were inadequate
and what he was up to gut to Naxos

335
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:35,450
before he did.
And the next scions we're ready.

336
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,780
He was defeated and uh,

337
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,210
the great king was not
pleased era staggers,

338
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,320
knew he was in a lot of trouble.

339
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:51,100
And so he decided that this was the time
for the Greeks of Asia minor to acquire

340
00:24:51,801 --> 00:24:53,960
their freedom from the Persians.

341
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,010
And he was obviously a very persuasive
talker and went around to the various

342
00:24:58,011 --> 00:25:03,011
Greek cities and was able to persuade
most of them to join in the rebellion,

343
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:08,180
which is indicative of course if the
fact that they were not happy in their

344
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,270
position as subjects of the great king.

345
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,220
So they rebel against the tyrants who
have been collaborating with the great

346
00:25:16,221 --> 00:25:18,770
king.
And this is an interesting point,

347
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:23,771
they establish democracies
now since as far as we know,

348
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:27,590
there is no democracy in the world
and it never has been before the one

349
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:29,960
established in Athens
just a few years ago.

350
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,060
I think there's a lot of reason to think
that the idea of doing that came from

351
00:25:35,061 --> 00:25:39,380
Athens. And that is easily believable
when you realize that Athens,

352
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,850
as I've told you before,

353
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,810
is an Ionian city just as these cities,

354
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:48,320
my elitist and the other towns that
they get to join them at first,

355
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:53,470
our Ionian cities and the Athenians are
recognized by the other own Ionians as

356
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:56,300
the leading Ionian city.

357
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,560
So that all of that makes me think that
it's hard to avoid the conclusion that

358
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:08,291
it's Athenian democracy that is the
model for these rebellious Ionian states.

359
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:11,690
But Agora stagger was,

360
00:26:11,691 --> 00:26:16,520
knows that he's going to be facing a
formidable enemy in the forces of the

361
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:17,390
Persian empire.

362
00:26:17,391 --> 00:26:22,391
And so he goes back to mainland
Greece to seek help for his,

363
00:26:22,491 --> 00:26:23,600
uh,
undertaking.

364
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:28,730
And the first place you're going to go
if you want military assistance in the

365
00:26:28,731 --> 00:26:33,290
Greek world, of course, is
Sparta. And there indeed, he goes,

366
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:37,250
uh, again, charming stories that
our auditors tells about it.

367
00:26:37,251 --> 00:26:40,730
He goes to King [inaudible]
and he tells him he would, uh,

368
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:44,940
what he's trying to do and he tells him
how rich the Persian empire is and how

369
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,400
if they are successful in this rebellion,

370
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:52,110
they will be able to see
some of the wealth in the
territory of the Persian king.

371
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:57,290
And won't that be nice for clay nominees
and perhaps with the Spartans as well.

372
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:00,630
Uh, clean. How many's um,
he says, well, I dunno know,

373
00:27:00,631 --> 00:27:03,290
he sort of scratches his head
and, and uh, he says, uh,

374
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,940
how far is the Capitol of Persia from
your city on the coast of the GNC?

375
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:17,850
And a bearish staggers is sharp
shrude cookie. And so he says,

376
00:27:17,851 --> 00:27:19,590
I'm glad you asked me this question.

377
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:25,160
And he pulls out the first recorded map
in all of Greek history and presumably

378
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:30,900
unrolls it. And he chose you.
You see, here's my leaders.

379
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,980
And then there's this royal road
and if you take it down here,

380
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:39,690
here is a Souza, the capital
of the Persian. This is,

381
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,510
how far is that?
How will the,

382
00:27:41,511 --> 00:27:44,250
how long would it take me to
march from the coast to there?

383
00:27:44,251 --> 00:27:47,970
He says three months clean.
When he says stranger,

384
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,220
get out of town by duck.

385
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,610
The idea of suggesting to
the Spartans that they,

386
00:27:53,611 --> 00:27:58,140
they should launch an expedition across
a c, which will then take them the army,

387
00:27:58,141 --> 00:28:02,160
they take their army three months,
March away from the coast,

388
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:05,490
not to mention from Sparta
leaving the city of course,

389
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:10,230
open to a hell lot rebellion all the time.
They're gone.

390
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:15,330
That is not a very welcome suggestion.
So Aricept egret says, well, you know,

391
00:28:15,331 --> 00:28:19,440
it's not really so bad. They
got this good road. Uh, besides,

392
00:28:19,441 --> 00:28:24,441
I have here some several Minai of
silver that are glad to give to you.

393
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,750
Might want to think again.
Uh,

394
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:31,260
and he keeps raising the amount that he's
prepared to bribe clean nominees at a

395
00:28:31,261 --> 00:28:33,600
certain point.
Clean nominees.

396
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:37,650
Little daughter Gorgol has been
sitting there all the time.

397
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:42,900
And being a spartan girl,
she gets to up to her father and says,

398
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:43,734
father,

399
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,960
ask this man to leave at
once or he will corrupt you.

400
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,980
Clay nominees accepted the admonition
from his nine year old daughter and sent

401
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,700
[inaudible] away.

402
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:01,920
So the effort to gain spartan
support in this rebellion fail.

403
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:07,200
Well, error Segrest says, okay, I'll
go, I'll try Athens now. It happens.

404
00:29:07,201 --> 00:29:11,190
Of course he's got a much
better shot in the first place.

405
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,470
Athens is an Ionian city,
unlike the Dorian Spartan second place.

406
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,700
Athens sits on the
seashore closer to Persia,

407
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:25,701
right on the GNC and obviously can feel
that there is a certain danger that

408
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,570
might be coming from Persia in any case,

409
00:29:30,571 --> 00:29:35,571
just because the Persians keep expanding
and they're now sitting right on the

410
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,120
Aegean Sea.
So for these reasons,

411
00:29:39,121 --> 00:29:42,640
and perhaps others maybe were already,

412
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:47,641
I was going to suggest maybe they were
already involved with Arrow staggers and

413
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:50,860
the, uh, the rebels of the,

414
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,380
the Greek cities of Asia minor
because of the democracy,

415
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:01,060
uh, idea. That gives me the suggestion
that has been some communication anyway,

416
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,170
whether that's true or not,

417
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:08,220
the Athenians vote to send a fleet and
soldiers to assist my us and the other

418
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:15,680
cities in their rebellion
and they sinned. Well, I'll,

419
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:20,470
I'll come back to how much they send in
a moment or auditors decides it's time

420
00:30:20,471 --> 00:30:21,580
to make a point.
He says,

421
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:26,790
this shows how much easier it is to
deceive many people rather than one.

422
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:32,380
Because by his count,
and this camp has got to be wrong,

423
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:37,600
there were 30,000 Athenians who
were involved in this decision.

424
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,190
That's certainly far too many.
Um,

425
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,410
and they were fooled by aristocracy,
whereas King Clay,

426
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:47,740
how many's the one man was not.
Um,

427
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:52,060
however that may be what the Athenians
wroted was the Sans 20 ships. Now,

428
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,590
scholars,
some scholars have said only 20 ships.

429
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:00,760
The only is really, I think, a
mistake. They are led to that.

430
00:31:00,761 --> 00:31:02,950
By knowing that later
in the fifth century,

431
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:07,750
the Athenians will end
up having 400 triremes.

432
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,770
But that's many years later.
That's after a victory over the Persians.

433
00:31:11,771 --> 00:31:13,330
That's in a totally new world.

434
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:19,230
The best guests I would have now is that
the older ships the Athenians had were

435
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:20,824
maybe 50.

436
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:25,780
So sending 20 was not
a trivial contribution.

437
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:30,490
Why did they do it? Well, for
all the reasons I've suggested,

438
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:35,350
they care about the Ionians, they are
their relatives in their own mind.

439
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,731
Moreover,

440
00:31:36,731 --> 00:31:41,410
they are not very friendly to Persia
after the exchanges they have had with the

441
00:31:41,411 --> 00:31:43,300
great king in which it's clear,

442
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:46,510
the only way to deal with the great
king is to become his subject,

443
00:31:46,511 --> 00:31:48,220
something they're not eager to do.

444
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:53,970
Another thing that we need to take into
account is that the Athenians remember,

445
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:59,190
at least back to the time of so long and
possibly before have been increasingly

446
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:04,330
engaged in trade with the east.

447
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,790
That is to say with Asia Minor,

448
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:11,620
with the Hellespont Sea of Marmara,
the Bosphorus beyond that,

449
00:32:11,621 --> 00:32:13,390
into the Black Sea,
in other words,

450
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:18,630
into territory bordering on the Persians
so that they have to feel that if the

451
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:23,530
Persians are unfriendly or if the,

452
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,350
if the Persians just do what
comes naturally to them,

453
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:30,670
they soon may be interfering
with things that we need.

454
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,990
We increasingly need.

455
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:36,991
The thing is will be increasingly
dependent on grain and a fish from those

456
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,840
waters. So the, uh,

457
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,160
all of that can explain why the Athenians
are willing to take this enormously

458
00:32:46,161 --> 00:32:51,161
risky decision when the Spartans of
course wouldn't think of doing it.

459
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:58,670
Heraclitus has this wonderful phrase
to describe the Athenian decision.

460
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:04,450
These ships were the beginning of
evils to the Greeks and the barbarians.

461
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:11,660
I guess what he's really saying is here
we have the beginning of the Persian

462
00:33:11,661 --> 00:33:15,770
wars. My subject, the Ionian
rebellion is one thing.

463
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,030
Theoretically,

464
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:21,050
if the Athenians had minded their own
business and not assisted the rebels,

465
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,330
then there need not
have been a Persian war.

466
00:33:23,331 --> 00:33:26,570
Heaven knows would have come what
motive come next. But in any case,

467
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:32,140
I think eroticism is saying once the
Athenians decided to participate,

468
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,720
assist the rebellion of
their relatives in Iowa.

469
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:40,220
This was the beginning of
the Persian wars for Athens.

470
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,223
Well,

471
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:47,350
the 20th Athenian ships land in my leaders
and their soldiers march inland very

472
00:33:49,641 --> 00:33:52,850
swiftly and reach the city of Sardis,

473
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,170
which is the capital of
the sat trappy of Lydia,

474
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:02,230
which is a now a Persian province and
are successful in defeating the forces

475
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:08,801
that come out against them and
set fire to the city of Sardis.

476
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:14,300
So they've done real harm. Having
done that, the Athenians, oh,

477
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:17,450
I forgive me, I've left out in
a small but important point.

478
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:22,990
The Athenians were joined by a few
ships provided by the city of Eretria,

479
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:29,500
another town in northern Euboea
and old time rival and an enemy of,

480
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,770
um, uh, what's that
other town up there? Uh,

481
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:41,360
just mentioned it a moment ago.
It's gone right out of my head.

482
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:46,490
What does anybody remember what town
that is? Calico's thank you very much.

483
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:51,410
[inaudible] they're old enemies of
calculus and that may account for why very

484
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:54,030
eager to help the Athenians,
uh,

485
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:59,080
because the Athenians have defeated kiss
and are keeping the child citians down.

486
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:03,650
In any case, they do. A few red trians.

487
00:35:03,651 --> 00:35:08,610
20 ships of Athenians
accomplished this deed of, uh,

488
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:13,550
doing considerable harm to the great
kings position there and Lydia.

489
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:15,710
Well,

490
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,800
now the Persians launch a thorough going
expedition with the intention of uh,

491
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:28,930
subduing there Ionian subjects and
bringing them back to subjugation.

492
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:34,310
Well, it's not all that easy. This
rebellion takes place in for 99.

493
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:39,910
The war against Persia
doesn't end until four 94.

494
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:47,660
What the Persians are doing is laying
siege to the city's one by one and taking

495
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:52,740
them one by one and then
attacking from the sea.

496
00:35:52,741 --> 00:35:53,790
And that was critical.

497
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,240
If they could defeat the fleets of the
Greek cities having already surrounded

498
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:01,320
them on the land side.

499
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,830
Those cities were out of business and
would have to surrender. And in four,

500
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,290
nine before the fleet,

501
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:12,270
but the Persians gathered the
Persians of course were landlubbers.

502
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:14,310
They had no navy of their own,

503
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:20,030
but they had a very considerable
navy provided by the,

504
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,770
uh,
Phoenicians,

505
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,800
who were among the earliest of the
sailors of the eastern Mediterranean,

506
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,180
whom this the Persians had conquered.

507
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:34,050
And the Egyptians who had
a naval tradition as well.

508
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:38,130
So there was a big Egyptian contingent,
a big Phoenician contingent.

509
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,650
And when they were under Persian rule,

510
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,310
the Ionians provided ships
for the great king too.

511
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:47,760
They weren't available right now that
we're going to be fighting against the

512
00:36:47,761 --> 00:36:50,730
great king.
But that's where he got his forces from.

513
00:36:50,731 --> 00:36:55,731
They were numerically superior and they
were very good sailors and horseman.

514
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:00,990
So finally at the battle of La de la De,

515
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,000
uh,
off the coast,

516
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:07,950
off the coast that is on the coast
of Asia minor, nearby, elitist,

517
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:14,360
the Persians destroyed the fleet of
the Greeks and put down the rebellion.

518
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,600
And then they took vengeance for
the whole thing by laying waste.

519
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:26,120
The city of my Litas entirely burning it
to the ground as best one could do that

520
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,890
in those days.

521
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:34,770
So the Ionian rebellion has come
to an inglorious conclusion.

522
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,630
What next?

523
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:42,320
What next is determined in considerable
part by the internal affairs of the city

524
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:44,930
of Athens?
Do you see meetings?

525
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:49,530
They're going to be the most troubled by
what has happened and also they have a

526
00:37:49,531 --> 00:37:52,470
reason to be trouble.
The great king like I,

527
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:57,471
this is true of most any great empire and
the great power that has been attacked

528
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:01,860
or even insulted by some smaller state.

529
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,990
You just can't let that go by.

530
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:09,200
You must punish that action to deter
similar behavior in the future.

531
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:14,601
So the Athenians had every reason to
fear and invasion or some sort of attack

532
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,240
from the Persians in the future.

533
00:38:18,241 --> 00:38:23,241
I think that is a critical
for understanding what's
going on in Athens in these

534
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,250
years and we do have a few glimpses,

535
00:38:26,251 --> 00:38:31,110
just a few glimpses that are difficult
to interpret but may possibly make a

536
00:38:31,111 --> 00:38:33,780
certain amount of sense.
It is interesting.

537
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:37,360
I think that in the year four 96,
five,

538
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:42,490
which is to say before
the battle of La Day,

539
00:38:42,491 --> 00:38:45,070
while the rebellion is still on,
uh,

540
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,860
the man who was elected the eponymous,

541
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:52,660
our con for that year is hip parkers,
the son of Karmas,

542
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,870
a relative of the Pi sister kids.

543
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,320
And he is precisely the
man who tradition says the,

544
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,560
the first ostracism was alleged
allegedly aimed at what is going on here.

545
00:39:07,871 --> 00:39:10,810
Why is the, uh, the uh,

546
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:15,870
bicester it'd hit park us being elected
at this point when in fact we know that

547
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:21,241
the Persians have said that they wished
to put his relative hippiest back on the

548
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:24,760
throne.
Why would the Athenians elect this guy?

549
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:30,060
But he only interpretation makes any sense
to me is that you remember that fairy

550
00:39:30,781 --> 00:39:35,170
tale I told you last time about the law
and ostracism and about how I imagined,

551
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:38,000
um,
[inaudible] he's telling him park his,

552
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:42,020
that he could avoid a lot of trouble
if he would join up with glycinate.

553
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,180
I think he did.

554
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:48,950
And I think his election to the art con
ship demonstrates that it's still Kleist

555
00:39:49,761 --> 00:39:54,280
in these regime that is in power.
If it Parker's gets elected,

556
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,790
our con it must be because he's on board.

557
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,360
All of this is hypothesis,
but it seems to me to make sense.

558
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:07,440
The next event that we
hear about an Athens that's
relevant to our story is that

559
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:12,570
in the year for 90 see C
for 93 the Athenian Tread
Gdn franticness presents his

560
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:21,730
play called the capture of my leaders.

561
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,410
We don't have the play,

562
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,680
but we have stories about it including
one neurotic this and what the stories

563
00:40:28,751 --> 00:40:30,730
say is that the,

564
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,760
the plague showed the scene of the taking
of my leaders and the destruction of

565
00:40:37,211 --> 00:40:42,100
the city by the Persians and
that the play was so moving.

566
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:47,580
The Athenians were made so unhappy by
seeing this story that they took measures

567
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:55,231
against the playwright from making them
so miserable and find him heavily for

568
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:01,240
doing so.
What's that all about?

569
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:05,140
Well, there are various
possible interpretations,

570
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:10,530
but I think the one that's most
persuasive to me is that phrenic is knew

571
00:41:11,021 --> 00:41:12,250
perfectly well,

572
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:17,490
that when he put on this play it would
cause great unhappiness and Athens and

573
00:41:19,241 --> 00:41:20,420
great anger.
I,

574
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:26,120
I think he hoped it would raise anger
against the Persians and it would support

575
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:32,521
the idea of the Athenians preparing
for war against the Persians,

576
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:37,490
either in the likelihood that the Persians
would invade or that the Athenians

577
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:41,990
what has to do something
aggressively against Persia somehow.

578
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:42,861
That's,

579
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:47,720
I think that's interpretation that strikes
me as being more plausible than other

580
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:51,110
possibilities. But again, it's
only a hot pie. I hypothesis

581
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:57,790
in the same year mill tie cities comes
back to Athens having traveled from his,

582
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:03,440
uh, home in, uh, the, the, um,

583
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:07,550
deliberate peninsula and uh,
he is,

584
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:13,070
think of it for a moment. What's his
position going to be? Visa VI Persia.

585
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,520
It has to be anti Persian because
he has betrayed the king of Persia.

586
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:22,430
He's obviously got a price on his head.

587
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,640
If the Persian succeed in putting hippiest
on the throne and making Persia boss

588
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:33,140
of Athens,
his life isn't worth a nickel.

589
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:37,360
So he's got to be anti Persian.
And uh,

590
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:41,870
I think the, um, uh,

591
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:47,090
what happens next has to be understood
in terms of the political struggle in

592
00:42:47,091 --> 00:42:49,470
Athens in which by no,
well not by,

593
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:54,210
oh no by no means were all
Athenians convinced that it
would be good thing to go

594
00:42:54,211 --> 00:42:56,930
to the war against Persia.
I mean it's crazy.

595
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:01,640
What I want to communicate to you is the
idea of fighting against Persia now is

596
00:43:01,641 --> 00:43:02,720
insane.

597
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:07,260
The Persians have conquered most of the
known world as far as the Greeks are

598
00:43:07,261 --> 00:43:08,094
concerned.

599
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:13,600
They have just bashed their fellow Greeks
with without a lot of trouble in Asia

600
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,010
Minor. Why would you want to,
uh, take these fellows on?

601
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,530
What you would want is to
avoid conflict with them,

602
00:43:21,531 --> 00:43:25,610
to try to find some means of
coming to terms with the Persians.

603
00:43:25,611 --> 00:43:29,990
I'm sure there must've been Athenians
and carotid to says there were,

604
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,920
who would have preferred excepting
hippiest back as tyrant and having the

605
00:43:36,111 --> 00:43:41,111
Persians be the real rulers of their
land rather than all getting killed when

606
00:43:41,421 --> 00:43:46,040
the Persians decided to come after them.
So you've got these two factions,

607
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,950
one pro Persian,
one anti Persian,

608
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:51,950
and the fact is,

609
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:57,220
apart from hypothesis that mill
tighties is brought to trial in Athens.

610
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:02,740
The official charge against him
is of having been a tyrant in the,

611
00:44:03,151 --> 00:44:07,660
uh, deliberately peninsula when he
was in charge of it there. And, uh,

612
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:11,390
he is in fact acquitted of the charge,

613
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:16,810
which may suggest if the jury was
influenced by popular opinion and had a

614
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:22,061
political view that the majority of
Athenians were not willing to take the

615
00:44:22,431 --> 00:44:25,880
tyranny back in any circumstances.
And what prepared to fight.

616
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:29,450
Now that the interpretation,
again, his hypothesis,

617
00:44:29,451 --> 00:44:32,430
the fact of the trial and
the acquittal are there

618
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:38,380
another interesting event is that
in the year four 93 to [inaudible],

619
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:42,270
that was one big year.
That year for 93, uh,

620
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:47,340
miss Stickley's is
elected the, uh, our con,

621
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:52,370
the eponymous art con for the year and
we shall see that some mystically is,

622
00:44:52,861 --> 00:44:57,270
will play a very large role in the
great Persian invasion of for 80,

623
00:44:57,271 --> 00:45:02,220
and he will be a participant in
the battle of marathon to and to,

624
00:45:02,221 --> 00:45:07,221
Mister [inaudible] is a
great champion of the navy.

625
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:12,980
He has concluded for varieties of reasons
that Athens must have a much larger

626
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:16,350
navy then she already has.

627
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,800
And he also is obviously a member of that
faction that thinks the Persians will

628
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,040
becoming and that wishes to be ready and
is eager to fight against the Persians.

629
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:35,190
So [inaudible] is on the scene and one
of the things he does that looks forward

630
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:40,191
to the rest of his career is that he wants
to move the naval base of Athens from

631
00:45:42,391 --> 00:45:43,560
Celeron Bay,

632
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:48,590
which is just a beach
unfortified completely open
to attack if anybody comes.

633
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:54,410
So the Athenian fleet presumably would
be drawn up on the sands of the beach at

634
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:58,870
Salieron, uh, where you can go
swimming to this very day. Um,

635
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:03,450
add. And if the those ships
are up there on the sands,

636
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,420
the Persian fleet come sailing up,
they're stuck.

637
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:11,810
What he wants to do is what he begins
to do to make piracy about five miles up

638
00:46:12,331 --> 00:46:16,740
the road into the port of Athens,
the naval base of Athens,

639
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:20,070
it has three of its own
harvest readily protected.

640
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,150
If you build walls around them,
if you four to five the piracy,

641
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:29,540
then you have a port that will be secure
against an attack and also be a very

642
00:46:30,031 --> 00:46:34,560
good base for moving out
of. So multidi, excuse me,

643
00:46:34,561 --> 00:46:39,561
some mystical ease demonstrates what will
be his policy for the rest of his life

644
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,900
in regard to Athens and he,

645
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,850
the fact that he's chosen our con may
be indicative of the mood in Athens,

646
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:53,510
which is increasingly unwilling to accept
the idea of a return of hippiest and

647
00:46:54,181 --> 00:46:58,950
the Persian rule and is
ready to fight about. Well,

648
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:03,980
by now the King of Persia has decided
that he must avenge all that has happened

649
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:09,990
and he must go after the
people who have done him harm.

650
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:14,940
Athens number one, the little
town of Eretria. Number two,

651
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:19,100
he takes a great Persian fleet,
uh,

652
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:24,140
accompanied by a great Persian army and
starts marching along the Aegean coast,

653
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,820
first the wet or the east coast,

654
00:47:26,821 --> 00:47:31,060
and then crosses the Hellespont and
goes over onto the northern coast.

655
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:36,210
And uh, his, uh, he himself is
not doing it is his general mark.

656
00:47:36,211 --> 00:47:37,750
Donius is in charge.

657
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:43,110
He conquers the regions of threes and
massive don on the north shore of the GNC.

658
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,840
Uh,
but in four 92,

659
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:52,650
while his fleet is lying off the
peninsula that contains Mount Athos,

660
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:58,530
one of those terrible Aegean storms that
can come up very suddenly does indeed

661
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:03,640
come up very suddenly and pretty well.
Rex,

662
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:08,730
the Persian fleet so serious is the
damage that the Persians have to abandon

663
00:48:09,401 --> 00:48:11,850
their invasion of Attica,
uh,

664
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,190
of grease and heading
for Athens at this time.

665
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:20,490
At this I should point out is precisely
the root the Persians will take for

666
00:48:22,451 --> 00:48:25,900
their major invasion in for 80.

667
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:30,280
But for the time being that has been put
off thanks to the intervention of the

668
00:48:30,281 --> 00:48:33,490
storm or as the Greeks might put it,
of the gods.

669
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,760
Now as the Persians have actually
begun to make their invasion,

670
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,630
the Greek cities are aware, the Persians
are coming, the Persians are coming.

671
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:51,070
And the question is what to
do. Well, the island of Regina,

672
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,640
which is unfriendly to Athens,
you remember from way back,

673
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:58,720
they decide we're not going to
be swept away with the Athenians.

674
00:48:58,721 --> 00:49:02,800
When the Persians get here and they
give earth and water to the king,

675
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:08,070
they have in fact become
Persian subjects at this point.

676
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,290
[inaudible] changes his mind.

677
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:16,320
He does not want to sit there quietly
while the Persians come and invade Greece.

678
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:21,760
And so he now goes to
the island of vagina,

679
00:49:21,761 --> 00:49:25,690
takes hostages,
delivers the hostages to the Athenians,

680
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:31,050
and in so doing creates a rapprochement
between Sparta and Athens.

681
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:34,960
And now the Spartans and
the Athenians are allies.

682
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:38,440
That doesn't mean the Athenians have
joined the Peloponnesian League.

683
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:43,500
They just establish friendly relations
after being at odds for such a period of

684
00:49:43,691 --> 00:49:44,524
time.

685
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:49,990
And there is a quarrel between the
two kings is, as I've told you,

686
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:50,980
and it's at this time,

687
00:49:50,981 --> 00:49:55,960
that demo radius is sent into exile and
clay nominees himself comes out very

688
00:49:55,961 --> 00:49:56,710
badly.

689
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:01,710
So both kings will be in some degree of
disgrace at the time of the battle of

690
00:50:03,521 --> 00:50:05,350
marathon.
Oh,

691
00:50:05,351 --> 00:50:10,351
let us turn them to the Persian invasion
that culminates in the battle of men of

692
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:15,040
marathon.
The purpose is very simple,

693
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:21,660
sorry to punish those cities that have
insulted and damage the great King Athens

694
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:25,773
and a retro

695
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:31,820
to restore hippies to the tyranny and
Athens and where from where he can serve

696
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:36,821
as the kings cetera and surely also to
gain a foothold in Greece on the way to

697
00:50:40,911 --> 00:50:43,190
conquering all of Greece.

698
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,280
Why should they want to
conquer all of Greece?

699
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:50,870
Hurghada this tells a story about his
relative and tells him, for God's sake,

700
00:50:50,871 --> 00:50:54,590
what do you want to go to? Greece?
There's nothing there, but a lot of rocks.

701
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:59,210
What is the point of conquering the place?
It's one thing to conquer wallabies.

702
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:03,870
Rich places Egypt Babylonia.
That's fine. This welfare,

703
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:08,720
there's huge populations is a lot of
good stuff. It's just Greeks and rocks.

704
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,310
Why in the world you want to go there?

705
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:15,440
And the answer I think in part would be
a Sir Edmund Hillary is answer because

706
00:51:15,441 --> 00:51:16,280
they're there.

707
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:22,420
And that's part of the answer because
you know we must understand that the

708
00:51:22,821 --> 00:51:24,470
ancient idea,
in fact,

709
00:51:24,471 --> 00:51:29,300
I'm willing to say the idea that dominated
thinking about such matters right

710
00:51:29,301 --> 00:51:33,020
down probably into the
19th century in many cases,

711
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:38,300
but certainly before the advent
of Christianity was this.

712
00:51:38,301 --> 00:51:41,060
That conquest is good.

713
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:46,910
It's good to be strong, it's good to
be rich, it's good to be powerful.

714
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:49,700
Therefore it's got to be stronger,
richer and more powerful.

715
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:54,560
And if there's somebody on your frontier,
take them over, and that by the way,

716
00:51:54,561 --> 00:51:58,700
will make you still more glorious
because conquest his glory.

717
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:02,210
Now we in the west,

718
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,850
that's not our natural attitude.

719
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:07,790
Our natural attitudes shaped
and considerable part,

720
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:12,830
whatever your religious
association may be by Christianity,

721
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:17,890
which has been the dominant force in
shaping people's thinking in the west,

722
00:52:18,141 --> 00:52:19,160
whatever,
as I say,

723
00:52:19,161 --> 00:52:23,900
whatever religion you belong to and that
aspect of Christianity that it violates

724
00:52:23,901 --> 00:52:28,550
is the one that's increasingly the
one that's emphasized by Christians.

725
00:52:28,551 --> 00:52:30,640
And that is the sermon on the mountain,

726
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,230
the one that says the meek
shall inherit the earth.

727
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:37,820
It's not the strong and tough and so,
and the one that says,

728
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:41,960
if your enemy strikes you, turn the other
cheek so he can strike you there too.

729
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:46,640
Now, if the Greeks had heard that, they
would've said, these people are lunatics,

730
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:51,440
send them away. Week morality
said, be good to your friend,

731
00:52:51,441 --> 00:52:54,440
do good to your friends
and harm to your enemies.

732
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:58,910
And the second part is just as
important as the first part.

733
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:05,260
So you need to understand that the sort
of the ethical underpinnings to all of

734
00:53:05,571 --> 00:53:10,571
our natural thinking and in the West
are as odd and strange and crazy as they

735
00:53:13,341 --> 00:53:17,360
can be for everybody else in the
human race. So far as I can see,

736
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:20,680
there are exceptions.
I'm, I'm missing some, uh,

737
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:24,320
eastern religions which have ideas that
are not altogether and ask them to what

738
00:53:24,321 --> 00:53:25,050
I'm saying.

739
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:29,340
But what I'm trying to say is nobody in
the ancient world would have ever had

740
00:53:29,341 --> 00:53:33,780
such an idea. Of course, if
you can conquer somebody who
is your neighbor, you do.

741
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:39,060
And so there was every reason to know
that the, the Persians were coming.

742
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:44,640
Um,
how many,

743
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:46,523
we don't know.

744
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:52,490
The estimate that most people would
accept is somewhere between 20 and 30,000

745
00:53:56,010 --> 00:54:00,120
infantry men. So for the sake
of splitting the difference,

746
00:54:00,121 --> 00:54:05,121
I always assume something like
25,000 infantry men and some cavalry.

747
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:07,890
That's very important.

748
00:54:07,891 --> 00:54:11,550
Even though the capillary does not
play any part in the actual battle of

749
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:13,770
marathon,
but Herat it,

750
00:54:13,771 --> 00:54:18,771
this makes it very clear that there
was a Persian cavalry that the Persians

751
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:22,500
picked the site of marathon to fight in,

752
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:26,520
in part because it was a good
place for cavalry to fight.

753
00:54:26,521 --> 00:54:31,230
So there's a Persian cavalry on board
the ships anyway, alongside the infantry,

754
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:35,370
the two Persian generals,
our datas and Arthur Fernie's,

755
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:40,080
um, they have with them.
Hippiest hippiest of course,

756
00:54:40,081 --> 00:54:45,081
must've been all these years urging the
great king to make some such a campaign.

757
00:54:46,021 --> 00:54:49,210
And he probably would have said,
and marathon is the place to land.

758
00:54:49,211 --> 00:54:52,440
Do you remember that's the territory
of the Pi's district heads.

759
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,770
That's where pie sister
this landed on his last, uh,

760
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:01,550
return to Athens when he made himself
Tyron. That's where his people, where,

761
00:55:01,551 --> 00:55:03,540
that's where his forces with gather.

762
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:07,680
I'm sure hippie has said what
all such exiles always say,

763
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,920
all I need do is set foot on the beach
at marathon and my people will rise up as

764
00:55:14,221 --> 00:55:15,720
one and join me.

765
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:19,590
You won't even have to fight in Athens
because there'll be so glad to see me

766
00:55:19,591 --> 00:55:21,990
back.
This is what King James,

767
00:55:21,991 --> 00:55:26,500
I'm sure told Louie the 14th is
about getting back to England.

768
00:55:26,501 --> 00:55:29,510
Then one, here's that all the time. Uh,

769
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,350
but it's a very important
part of this story.

770
00:55:31,351 --> 00:55:35,610
I don't think we can understand what
happens at marathon if we don't know that

771
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:40,640
everybody thought it was highly possible
that there were Athenians who were

772
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:46,730
eager to restore hippy as to the throne
and would be willing to engage in

773
00:55:47,821 --> 00:55:52,821
treasonous activities or to defect from
the democracy and join it be as if the

774
00:55:54,781 --> 00:55:57,300
circumstances were appropriate.

775
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,750
So that's in the back of everybody's mind.
They were in the front.

776
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,230
I think when the Persians got there,

777
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:08,260
their strategy included the belief that
there would be treason in Athens that

778
00:56:09,931 --> 00:56:12,810
would turn the city over to them
if the circumstances were right.

779
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:17,370
So that forced starts this time,
not, not, not along the coast.

780
00:56:17,371 --> 00:56:18,570
As I told you last time,

781
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:23,750
it takes the shortest route directly
across the hopping from island to island,

782
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:27,520
stops it in that sauce.

783
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:31,510
Member Nexus in Noida King by
successfully resisting are staggering,

784
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:36,400
is a invasion and they destroy next sauce.

785
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:41,470
Next they come to the island of
deloss in the middle of the Aegean,

786
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:46,530
the island sacred to Apollo and his
sister artimus a very sacred place indeed

787
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:49,540
for the Greeks.
What to the versions?

788
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:53,410
Do they treat the arc?
I'm not the article,

789
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:56,060
but they treat the deacons
and the priests of Apollo,

790
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:59,590
the loss with great respect,
do them no harm.

791
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:04,330
This is typical Persian conquest.
They do not impose religions.

792
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:08,860
Their religion is different from that
of most of the others in this area.

793
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:11,230
They are Zoroastrians.

794
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:16,450
They are sun worshipers of
a certain con. Uh, and uh,

795
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:19,400
but they don't impose their religion.
They don't interfere with their religion.

796
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:22,420
They get a very nice writeup in
the Old Testament, if you remember,

797
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:27,900
because they don't mistreat the Hebrews
and they particularly don't do them,

798
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:31,610
uh,

799
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:35,410
in compelled them to abandon their own
religious practices as the other invaders

800
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:39,080
do. So what is, uh, what,

801
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:41,290
what are the Persians
saying by these actions?

802
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,050
They are saying we are not
at war with the Greek gods.

803
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,300
We're not even at war with the Greeks.

804
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:51,630
We are simply punishing these two Ms
Korean towns that have attacked us.

805
00:57:55,150 --> 00:58:00,150
They then turn to the southern tip of
the island of Euboea to the town of

806
00:58:00,251 --> 00:58:04,630
characters. The persons may
be not at war with the Greeks,

807
00:58:04,631 --> 00:58:08,770
but they expect all Greeks or along the
way to behave the way they're supposed

808
00:58:08,771 --> 00:58:09,670
to,
to the great king.

809
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:14,050
And so they asked the Corinthians to
give Earth and water they're Corinthians

810
00:58:14,051 --> 00:58:18,200
refuse and the Persians,
oh, obliterate. Uh,

811
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:22,750
but their city and take
their people into slavery.

812
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:26,350
Now they push their way,

813
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:31,390
take their sale along the coast of
Euboea to Eretria in the north east.

814
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:36,360
And now here are 4,000 Athenians
settled there. Remember?

815
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:39,420
In a clarification. So right. They, uh,

816
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:44,500
get their armor on and they stand in
front and a prepared to dub die fighting

817
00:58:44,951 --> 00:58:49,600
for the freedom of Eretria because of
their wonderful friendship to Athens.

818
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:54,160
Wrong.
The 4,000 Athenians go home to Attica.

819
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:59,140
Why? Well, I suppose the
immediate answer is why not?

820
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:04,540
But the,
it's an embarrassment and Hirata at this,

821
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:09,160
I think we have to realize is very
friendly to Athens all throughout his own

822
00:59:09,161 --> 00:59:11,350
history. I doubt that there's, I mean,

823
00:59:11,351 --> 00:59:13,240
there's no doubt that
he spent time in Athens.

824
00:59:13,241 --> 00:59:16,780
He seems to have been a friend
of Paraclese in later years.

825
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,490
He was kindly,

826
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:22,760
although he himself comes from
helicopter Nassis in Asia Minor,

827
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:26,780
but he did, he did spend a
lot of time in Athens and uh,

828
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:31,820
there seems to be a pro Athenian cast.
One thing also is that many of his,

829
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:36,440
um, sources were Athenians
who told the story their way.

830
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:41,750
So their answer was the Athenians were
ready to fight to save Eretria but the

831
00:59:41,751 --> 00:59:46,430
retro Ian said is no point. Why should
you get killed too? It's not your town.

832
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:50,270
Why don't you go home if you can
believe that you can believe anything.

833
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:56,090
But I don't. I think the Athenians
realized there was nothing but disaster.

834
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:59,240
If they stayed in, they could
believe if we get back to Attica,

835
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:03,800
we might be able to make a contribution
to defending our city. Okay,

836
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:07,760
so now here they are at Eretria,
the Athenians are gone.

837
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:12,740
It's time for the invasion,
the site of the battle.

838
01:00:12,741 --> 01:00:15,740
Where do they go? Well, they
picked marathon as I say,

839
01:00:15,741 --> 01:00:20,030
in part because it's very near
Eretria. Secondly, as a Herata says,

840
01:00:20,031 --> 01:00:23,480
because it's a good place for cavalry.
Thirdly, as I've already told you,

841
01:00:23,481 --> 01:00:26,420
because it's the stronghold of Pi Sisters,

842
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:31,660
the place which would be natural for an
army trying to establish hippiest on the

843
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:34,400
throne of that.
That's why they're there.

844
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:38,420
And their plan I think
is to go to marathon.

845
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:42,650
If the Pussy Athenians come out
and challenge them to a fight,

846
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:46,490
they will crush the Athenians.
But they didn't expect that.

847
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:49,340
They thought the Athenians
would be afraid, but,

848
01:00:49,341 --> 01:00:53,720
and that what would happen is they would
stay there in marathon until they got

849
01:00:53,721 --> 01:00:57,650
the news that there was
a revolution in Athens,

850
01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:00,140
prepare to turn the city over to them.

851
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:04,250
That's what hit me is I think led them to
believe in. That's what they hoped for.

852
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:08,990
They were prepared to fight of course,
but they thought it wouldn't be necessary.

853
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:12,680
So on August the fourth,

854
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:17,330
they land in the year for 90 at marathon.

855
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:21,500
We know these dates
because there are, uh, uh,

856
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:23,480
as an eclipse associated with this,

857
01:01:23,481 --> 01:01:26,930
which allows astronomers
to fix it pretty precisely.

858
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:29,480
The Athenians of course,

859
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:33,470
when they knew that the Persians were
coming and that news would have come to

860
01:01:33,471 --> 01:01:38,030
them, the minute they got to Mac sauce,
then ships would have come to Athens.

861
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:42,350
So the seniors were well worn,
went to their new friends,

862
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:44,930
Sparta to ask them for help.
Of course.

863
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:47,840
And this is where a
wonderful stories they sent.

864
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:52,630
The great runner who's named comes
down to us in the manuscripts as five

865
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:56,900
[inaudible]. Chances are his
real name was Phillip cities,

866
01:01:56,901 --> 01:01:58,700
but there was an error in the manuscript,

867
01:01:58,701 --> 01:02:03,570
but we'll call him five deputies cause
that's what the manuscripts say. And uh,

868
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:09,380
he um,
he races to Sparta as fast as he could go.

869
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:14,800
Took them less than two days where
he came to the Spartans and he said,

870
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:19,100
the Persians are coming, the Persians
are coming. Please help us. The Spartan.

871
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:23,820
We would love to come and
help you. Nothing would
please us more. Unfortunately,

872
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,830
we are in the midst of our holy religious
ceremony that cornea and we are not

873
01:02:28,831 --> 01:02:33,831
allowed until to leave our
hometown until the next full moon,

874
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:40,260
which is a matter of fact, is
the night of August 11th, 12th.

875
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:44,340
In other words,
a whole week after the,

876
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:46,950
the Persians are going to land,

877
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:51,870
I can't go speculating as to what
are we to make of this? Is this me?

878
01:02:51,871 --> 01:02:56,700
Is this just an excuse of the Spartan
series about this? Our tendency,

879
01:02:56,701 --> 01:03:00,570
I suppose being modern and cynical
would be to say it's only an excuse.

880
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,130
I'm more inclined to think that
they were sincere about it.

881
01:03:05,131 --> 01:03:08,700
It's not that they couldn't find
ways to get round such things,

882
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:13,760
but they really took their religion quite
seriously. And it may be that, uh, uh,

883
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:15,810
you know,
that did play a role,

884
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:19,530
be that as it may two things
that the Athenians now know,

885
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:24,510
they know the Spartans have promised
to come, but not for another week.

886
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:29,130
Both of those things should be, uh, on
your minds as you try to understand.

887
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:30,890
Now,

888
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:35,890
[inaudible] says that the Athenian army
marched out from Athens and went to

889
01:03:36,391 --> 01:03:39,360
marathon, and then they had an
argument about what they should do.

890
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,090
But I don't think that's right.
There must have been a debate.

891
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:43,710
There had to be a debate in Athens.

892
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:48,990
You couldn't take an army out of town
without having an assembly to argue the

893
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,930
question, should we send an army?
And if we should send an army,

894
01:03:51,931 --> 01:03:53,370
how big should the army be?

895
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:56,850
And having that decided that
who should be in command.

896
01:03:56,910 --> 01:04:00,420
All those things had to be
settled by the assembly in Athens.

897
01:04:00,421 --> 01:04:03,420
So that's where the debate took place.

898
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:08,990
Some favored defending the city of Athens.

899
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:14,870
Now we don't know how well
the city of Athens was walled,

900
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:21,360
defended by fortification
at this time in its history.

901
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:24,990
It may not have had any wall,
but I'd be surprised.

902
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:30,290
But it certainly did not have a wall that
was guaranteed to be effective against

903
01:04:31,171 --> 01:04:32,004
an attack.

904
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:37,190
And so I think we should understand that
is not going to be successful to stay

905
01:04:37,501 --> 01:04:42,450
home and defend the Athens means to allow
the Persians to run all around Attica

906
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,090
doing anything they want,
causing all the harm.

907
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:50,090
They could remember something over 75%
maybe as many as 90% of the Athenians had

908
01:04:52,111 --> 01:04:53,550
farms out in the country.

909
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:58,290
Now the houses out in the country that
would have been exposed to the Persians,

910
01:04:58,291 --> 01:05:02,040
and so there was good reason for them
not to think that was a great idea.

911
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,000
The alternative was to send an army out
to allow the Persians to land because

912
01:05:09,001 --> 01:05:11,340
they couldn't stop it. They didn't know
where the Persians were going to come,

913
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:15,420
but as soon as they heard
that the Persians had landed
to send an army there and

914
01:05:15,421 --> 01:05:19,780
meet them at the place of landing mill.

915
01:05:19,781 --> 01:05:24,040
Tinies emerges as the leading figure here.
Not because,

916
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:28,390
I mean he is in general,
but that's not the only reason.

917
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:32,980
It's because everybody knows
mill [inaudible] is the
resident Persian expert.

918
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:35,770
He has been a general in the Persian army.

919
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:40,720
And so that gives him a come,
a reason to be listened to.

920
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:45,520
But he's obviously also a person of
great merit and quality proves it at the

921
01:05:45,521 --> 01:05:49,300
battle of marathon. Uh, he
must've been an impressive fellow.

922
01:05:49,301 --> 01:05:53,290
So for all these reasons,
whatever his formal position was,

923
01:05:53,291 --> 01:05:56,480
and I think it was simply
one of the generals de facto,

924
01:05:56,770 --> 01:06:00,880
he had much more influence
than others for these reasons.

925
01:06:00,881 --> 01:06:05,881
And his argument was let us go out and
meet the Persians where they land and the

926
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:10,290
reasons where we,

927
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:15,370
we don't want them to be able to get
to the Spartans. But beyond that,

928
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:20,430
there was fear that if we stay home and
wait and let the Persians do whatever

929
01:06:22,541 --> 01:06:23,950
they're going to do every day,

930
01:06:23,951 --> 01:06:28,870
that passes increases the danger of
treason from those people who want to turn

931
01:06:28,871 --> 01:06:31,810
the city over.
Um,

932
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:37,230
and it's also so completely against
the ethic of the Greek warrior.

933
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,750
And I would say more
specifically the hoplite warrior.

934
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:44,920
You don't let your enemy
ravage your countryside.

935
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:49,810
You don't let them destroy your farm.
This in a way,

936
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:53,690
goes all the way back to,
to homer, the notion of RFA.

937
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:56,050
A man must have courage.

938
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:58,810
He must stand up against an
enemy who invades his country.

939
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:01,540
And then again beyond that,

940
01:07:01,541 --> 01:07:05,200
you move to the world of the hoplite
and you're talking about defending your

941
01:07:05,201 --> 01:07:09,460
homestead. All of that argument
for going out there. So,

942
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:10,270
uh,

943
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:14,440
the terminology I would use for modern
terminology to explain what the Athenian,

944
01:07:14,441 --> 01:07:18,210
that strategy was to go out
and to contain the beachhead,

945
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:21,730
go out,
confront us Persians where they are,

946
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:25,180
don't let them get inland
from where they landed.

947
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:30,280
So they do land at marathon
with about 2,500 infantry.

948
01:07:30,281 --> 01:07:33,910
And I remember their
infantry are not hoplites,

949
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,580
they do not have heavy armor.

950
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:42,490
There are pictures on a
wonderful paintings on vases.

951
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:47,020
Yes sir. I meant thousand, I hope by yeah,

952
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:50,140
thanks very much. Um, there,

953
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:54,580
there are visas that showed the Persian
soldiers at marathon and they are

954
01:07:54,581 --> 01:07:59,230
wearing a pants as I told you.
But then at carrying any,

955
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:02,390
uh,
they're not wearing any armor and their,

956
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:06,940
their shield is a kind of a wicker
shield so that their armament is much

957
01:08:06,941 --> 01:08:09,340
inferior to the hoplites.

958
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:14,490
And keep in mind too that the Persian
army is always made up of a collection of

959
01:08:15,771 --> 01:08:18,380
subject peoples. Yes,
there will be some Persian,

960
01:08:19,190 --> 01:08:23,420
but there will also be a lots of
folks who are not Persians in there.

961
01:08:23,421 --> 01:08:27,020
So they lacked that unity that the Greeks,
we'll have

962
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:33,850
the,
excuse me,

963
01:08:33,851 --> 01:08:35,230
I got this thing a little backwards.

964
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:43,150
Well, nevermind. Um,

965
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,920
mealtime.
Andy's plan is this,

966
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:52,290
there are something like 10,000 Greeks
about 9,000. That's ain't aliens.

967
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:57,300
About a thousand are veterans against,
let us say 25,000 Persians.

968
01:08:57,780 --> 01:09:00,750
And so, uh, as the thing begins,

969
01:09:01,290 --> 01:09:06,290
the map here shows you the rough
picture of the field at marathon here.

970
01:09:07,290 --> 01:09:12,290
The Persians landed right here and had
their ships drawn up at this place.

971
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:16,140
They had their camp behind here.
This Marshall,

972
01:09:16,141 --> 01:09:19,470
would it be a little bit more over
this way? It's a very serious,

973
01:09:19,471 --> 01:09:24,030
Marsha will play an important role
in what happens. The Greeks come out,

974
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:26,430
they'd probably bully.
Came marching in through this way.

975
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:28,650
And here we have mountains.

976
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:31,740
This wavy line indicates
the line of the mountains.

977
01:09:31,741 --> 01:09:34,920
Here you have a really flat plane,
but here you have mountains.

978
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:37,830
And somewhere up on the hills here,

979
01:09:38,190 --> 01:09:42,660
there was the Greek camp near them.
Modern Church of Saint Demetrius.

980
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:47,820
This little dot reflects
the mound where the dead,

981
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:51,990
the Greek dead at marathon will
after the battle be buried.

982
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:57,380
And that is likely to be about the
place with a main fighting took place,

983
01:09:59,010 --> 01:10:03,770
which helps us to place where the
actual battle took place. So the,

984
01:10:03,771 --> 01:10:07,240
the idea of the, uh, of the, uh,

985
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:12,240
Athenians was to try to hold
him there as long as they could.

986
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:17,040
But the Greeks have the upper hill,
the Persians are down below.

987
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:20,490
If the Persians want to start a fight,

988
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:25,470
then they ought to come that they
will have to come running up the hill.

989
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:30,690
Well, that is not a very attractive
proposition. And so the Greeks feel,

990
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:34,410
let them come for us. It's our country.
They're sitting here on the thing.

991
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:37,800
They've got to do something.
We don't. Meanwhile,

992
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:41,040
the Persians are waiting for treason.

993
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,890
So if the city will be
surrendered to them,

994
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:49,760
a week goes by with the two sides
looking at each other and doing nothing.

995
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:56,670
I always like to compare the Athenian
strategy to an old fashioned football

996
01:10:56,671 --> 01:10:59,430
strategy,
which I haven't seen done now in decades,

997
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:03,390
which used to be kick on first
down and wait for a fumble.

998
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:09,240
In other words, let give the ball to the
Persians and let them make a mistake.

999
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,840
Uh, I think that's what was
in mill tighties mind. Well,

1000
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:19,560
time passes and the Persians realize we
can't sit there forever. For one thing,

1001
01:11:19,561 --> 01:11:22,680
they're going to run out of food
and water for another thing.

1002
01:11:22,681 --> 01:11:26,100
The great king will want to
hear something. Well, how'd
you do? What did you do?

1003
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:28,830
We sat there and watched the these scenes.
No good.

1004
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:35,280
So the plan that the Persians made, I
think was this, that they would take,

1005
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,600
let us say for the sake of argument,
10,000 troops,

1006
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:45,590
put them on the ships, load
up the cavalry with, uh,

1007
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:50,660
onto the ships to and send those ships
around Attica to come up to fallow on

1008
01:11:52,621 --> 01:11:56,430
bay, straight into Athens. And meanwhile,

1009
01:11:56,431 --> 01:12:00,870
take the 15,000 that are left,
March them up too close,

1010
01:12:00,871 --> 01:12:05,871
as close as you could get to the Greeks
and fix the Greeks there so that they

1011
01:12:05,881 --> 01:12:08,640
can't go back and defend, uh, Athens.

1012
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:13,170
So there's no army to protect assets.
So if those guys get off the ships,

1013
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:17,430
come sailing into the harbor,
walk up to town, it's theirs.

1014
01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:23,030
If the Athenians are crazy enough from
the Persian point of view to come running

1015
01:12:23,611 --> 01:12:26,550
down the hill or walking down
the hill of whatever into,

1016
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:31,290
to be outnumbered three to two
by us in any way are Persians,

1017
01:12:31,291 --> 01:12:35,520
we always beat Greeks. We've got nothing
to worry about, then, uh, let him do it.

1018
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:41,400
So they come now [inaudible] he's
in charge on the day of the battle,

1019
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:45,690
he's got the problem that they
have 5,000 more troops than he has.

1020
01:12:46,410 --> 01:12:47,760
He's worried about being outflanked.

1021
01:12:48,710 --> 01:12:53,710
So what each decides to do is to weaken
the depths of his line because he must

1022
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:58,860
cover the length of the Persian line.
Well,

1023
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
the danger with that is of course,
that when they hit each other,

1024
01:13:03,001 --> 01:13:07,020
the Persians will break through the Greek
lines. So instead of making it even,

1025
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:12,210
he loaded up the wings and left the
center even weaker than it would otherwise

1026
01:13:12,211 --> 01:13:12,601
have been.

1027
01:13:12,601 --> 01:13:17,601
His hope and strategy was
that the Athenians would
win on the wings before the

1028
01:13:18,421 --> 01:13:21,990
Persians could break through the middle
and then the Athenians could turn on the

1029
01:13:21,991 --> 01:13:26,700
center of the Persians and to feed them
and just barely. That's what happened.

1030
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:32,070
The Persians did break through the
center, but it was too late. By that time,

1031
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:33,330
the Greek wing,

1032
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:38,130
the Athenian Wings were successful
and drove the Persians before them.

1033
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:40,890
The Persians ran away like mad,

1034
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:45,920
but they ran into the great swamp
and that made their escape much more

1035
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:51,300
difficult. So the Athenians were
able to kill great numbers of them.

1036
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:56,430
And finally that that battle was
over and now the battle was over.

1037
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:00,600
Let's imagine that it took a couple
of hours. That would be a long time.

1038
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:03,450
The Athenians had time now to have a meal,

1039
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:07,800
take a little rest and
March back across to Attica,

1040
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:11,070
which ad before the ships could get there.

1041
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:15,520
And I like to imagine the
scene when it all happened.

1042
01:14:15,521 --> 01:14:19,900
The Persians coming around the last bend
of the bay as they coming to Fowler on

1043
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:24,550
expecting to see a nice empty
beach and seeing the Athenian army.

1044
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:25,031
I liked them.

1045
01:14:25,031 --> 01:14:30,031
Imagine with their left foot in the
breakers and their shields up in there,

1046
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:32,973
uh,

1047
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:38,340
spears up with the sun gleam off their
shields and blinding the Persians as they

1048
01:14:43,361 --> 01:14:44,194
came.

1049
01:14:44,910 --> 01:14:48,580
And at which point you can't force a
landing against an army just can't be done

1050
01:14:48,581 --> 01:14:49,414
in the ancient world.

1051
01:14:49,690 --> 01:14:52,540
These guys had to go home and start
thinking about what they're going to tell

1052
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:57,100
the great king.
The Athenians won the battle.

1053
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:03,100
Very large, very large, uh,
casualties for the Persians.

1054
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:08,430
Only 192 Greeks killed in the battle
and allowed the extraordinary honor of,

1055
01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:15,820
um, being buried on the field
where they bet have fought.

1056
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:18,340
Next Day,

1057
01:15:18,370 --> 01:15:23,370
2000 Spartans come marching into Attica
that proves they were serious and were

1058
01:15:24,131 --> 01:15:25,750
told what had happened.
They asked permission,

1059
01:15:25,751 --> 01:15:28,210
can we go to the
battlefield and look at it?

1060
01:15:28,211 --> 01:15:32,170
And there they saw all these dead
Persians and no one had ever seen anything

1061
01:15:32,171 --> 01:15:35,260
like that.
No Greeks that ever beat Persians before.

1062
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:38,210
And Great was the glory of the Athenians.

1063
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:41,230
So I've described very
inadequately in to swiftly.

1064
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:43,750
The battle was so what?

1065
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:47,410
What is the significance
of this silly little Babel,

1066
01:15:47,411 --> 01:15:52,411
10,000 Greeks against the 15,000
Persians back a billion years ago?

1067
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:58,510
What does it matter? And Lots of folks
will tell you that, especially these days,

1068
01:15:58,810 --> 01:16:01,090
but I remember in 1936,
there was a,

1069
01:16:01,091 --> 01:16:05,680
a wonderful conference of pacifists,
uh,

1070
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:10,800
who met in England at which the dominant
theme of the speakers was no war ever

1071
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:15,250
made any difference.

1072
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:20,050
What I like about that was that the
place of the meeting was Hastings.

1073
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:26,650
The battle was seen throughout
the rest of Greek history.

1074
01:16:26,651 --> 01:16:31,651
First of all is a great victory for
hoplites as opposed to their opponents in,

1075
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:36,790
in later Greek history. When the
navy, when the Athenian history,

1076
01:16:36,791 --> 01:16:40,810
when the navy becomes a big
thing, it is the, the party,

1077
01:16:40,811 --> 01:16:45,811
the old fashioned and more conservative
party that thinks about marathon as the

1078
01:16:46,661 --> 01:16:51,130
great victory that day that those
hoplite farmers saved Greece,

1079
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,210
the navy guys,
the poor like to think about Salomon,

1080
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:56,380
the naval battle in for Haiti,

1081
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,010
it was seen as a victory for democracy.

1082
01:17:00,730 --> 01:17:04,120
It was the Athenian Democrats later on.

1083
01:17:04,121 --> 01:17:07,960
I'm sure there were glad
the per the Spartans never
got there because they could

1084
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:11,210
claim it as their own and as a
victory for democracy as well.

1085
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,520
It was also the first,
as I say,

1086
01:17:13,521 --> 01:17:18,020
Greek defeat of the Persians as
Hurghada and says for up until then,

1087
01:17:18,290 --> 01:17:22,670
even the name of Persians was a
fearful thing for Greeks to here.

1088
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:28,930
It was the source of tremendous national
pride and glory for Athens and scholars

1089
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:34,511
have compared the impact of the battle
of marathon on the Athenian image of

1090
01:17:36,681 --> 01:17:41,681
themselves with the defeat of the Spanish
armada by Elisabeth's English fleet,

1091
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:47,480
uh, and the beginning of the
glory of the Elizabethan era.

1092
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:53,290
It was seen as a victory for freedom
because the price of the feet would have

1093
01:17:54,171 --> 01:17:57,980
been slavery in every sense
as they understood it.

1094
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:01,760
Greek civilization,
and I'll come back to this in a minute,

1095
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:06,590
could have been strangled in it's
infancy because it is in its infancy,

1096
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:08,181
but again,

1097
01:18:08,181 --> 01:18:13,100
we ought to pay attention to those people
who suggest that people like me are

1098
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:16,730
over embellishing the
significance of all this.

1099
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:22,510
One English statesman said,
war wins, nothing cures,

1100
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:26,960
nothing settles nothing.
Speaker was Neville Chamberlain

1101
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:34,070
and 90 36 Bertrand Russell philosophy
declared disarmament and complete pacifism

1102
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:39,280
is indisputably the wisest policy and
he urged the gradual disbanding of the

1103
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:45,380
British Army, navy and air force as
Hitler was moving into the Rhineland.

1104
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,640
Does victory in war make a difference?

1105
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:53,210
I would say as the losers,

1106
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:59,140
the victims and the survivors
of the Holocaust ask the
descendants of the slaves

1107
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:04,100
in the American south.
Remember this,

1108
01:19:04,101 --> 01:19:09,101
if the Athenians had lost at Marathon
East Golez had just begun his career as a

1109
01:19:12,561 --> 01:19:15,410
playwright.
Sophocles hadn't written a play.

1110
01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:17,840
Your deputies of course hadn't either,

1111
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:22,760
nor had Aristophanes
Socrates pick up this, right?

1112
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:25,250
Yeah.
Socrates wasn't born yet,

1113
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:29,660
much less Plato, Aristotle, Phineas.

1114
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,630
There was no Parthenon.

1115
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:36,890
None of those glorious buildings
that we make us think about.

1116
01:19:36,891 --> 01:19:39,440
The greatness that was
Greece had been constructed.

1117
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:45,460
There would be no democracy because
this was the only place where it had any

1118
01:19:46,671 --> 01:19:49,760
existence.
The scientific revolution,

1119
01:19:49,761 --> 01:19:51,800
which was almost in beyond,

1120
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:56,240
beyond it's infancy in terms of being new,
uh,

1121
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:58,520
would have been wiped out.
There would be no memory.

1122
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:00,560
There would be no record of any of this,

1123
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,680
and therefore no Western civilization,

1124
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:09,400
no political freedom for all these have
occurred in no other culture in all the

1125
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:12,180
years since that time.

1126
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:16,830
That's why I wanted you to know a
little bit about the battle of Marathon,

1127
01:20:16,831 --> 01:20:21,180
because I think all of
us alive today here, oh,

1128
01:20:21,181 --> 01:20:26,181
a very great debt to the
10,000 marathoner Mccoy,

1129
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:28,680
the fighters of marathon,

1130
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:32,740
who fought for Greek
freedom and for hours too.
