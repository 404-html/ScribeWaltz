1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,860
The Persians were busy with other things
as well as thinking about returning to

2
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:12,510
Greece because the great king was not

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,190
willing and understandably in a way
to accept his defeat by these few puny

4
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:26,181
Greeks because of the consequences that
would have for the reputation of Persia.

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,280
And just as a matter of personal honor
these kings would not have been glad to

6
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:34,890
accept such an outcome.

7
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,470
I won't drag you through the details
of the invasion by the Persians and for

8
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:44,430
eighty. After all of making you read
Herodotus and the whole problem about it.

9
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,270
But let me simply talk a bit about the
conclusion to the great invasions of the

10
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:57,291
great Persian Wars as we call them and
also to say something about what their

11
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:04,161
meaning was the meaning of the defeat
of the Persians and 479 was broader than

12
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,500
the meaning of their
defeat at Marathon in 490.

13
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,320
For one thing it involved
the entire Greek nation.

14
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,030
Of course it wasn't the nation.

15
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,690
But you know I'm using the word loosely
of course it didn't involve the whole of

16
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:28,710
that nation no matter how loosely I use
it because if you imagine that there are

17
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:33,711
over a thousand plays there were only
thirty one who signed up to resist the

18
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,920
Persian invasion and for eighty however
they included the most important and

19
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,260
strongest and largest of the Greek poles.

20
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,340
So it's not too much of a stretch to speak
a bit speak of it as a Greek victory.

21
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,240
And again the same issue that had been
present at Marathon the question of

22
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:04,311
whether the Greeks would continue to
live their lives free in their place

23
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,430
developing their own style their unique
style of life or become another province

24
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:17,040
of the realm of the Persian
Empire just like so many others.

25
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,850
And we can see that in one wonderful
contemporary reference to the meaning of

26
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:29,710
the war it's in Aeschylus his first oldest
surviving play Persians in which the

27
00:02:32,721 --> 00:02:37,721
central event is the great sea battle
at Salomon house in which the Greeks

28
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,960
defeat the Persian fleet which guarantees
that the Persians will not win a great

29
00:02:45,141 --> 00:02:50,141
victory even though two more decisive
battles in the following year 479 are

30
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:53,150
necessary to drive the Persians away.

31
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:59,230
But here's what Aeschylus has
described in his play Persians.

32
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,820
He he's a he's having the story told by
and by I guess it's actually I'm trying

33
00:03:07,911 --> 00:03:11,120
to remember it may well have been a
Persian who was telling this story but in

34
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:13,340
any case probably not it
was one of the Greeks.

35
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,810
Anyway here's what he says a mighty shout
greeted our ears on you sons of hell

36
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:26,131
us free your homeland free your children
your wives the homes of your father's

37
00:03:29,391 --> 00:03:33,260
gods and the tombs of your ancestors.

38
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,220
In other words does this play was put
on something like oh about I think it's

39
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:44,621
about seven years after the Battle
of Salem is so it's it's almost a

40
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:50,051
contemporary event and you can see that
from the first the Greeks view this war

41
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:56,740
as being about freedom as opposed to
many other possible considerations.

42
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:04,640
And in the spring and the following
year in 479 there were two great battles

43
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,290
that decided the outcome of the war.

44
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,310
Finally on the land the battle of Plata
in southern B OCA in which a great Greek

45
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,870
army which included the major cities
including especially Sparta and Athens

46
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:28,130
took on a powerful Persian land
army and defeated them on land.

47
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,810
Herodotus says on the very same day it
would be a wonderful coincidence if it

48
00:04:33,811 --> 00:04:38,811
were true but it may be
true a fundamentally a sea
battle was fought off the

49
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:45,101
coast of Asia Minor at my Cally where
again the Greek fleet once more destroyed

50
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,860
the Persian fleet and at that point the
Persians had no choice but simply to

51
00:04:53,931 --> 00:04:58,931
flee and to try to escape the the Greeks
who were pursuing them and doing their

52
00:04:59,991 --> 00:05:04,820
best to kill as many of them as they could
now.

53
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,850
After my colleague a very important
event took place that cast a long shadow

54
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,750
about the future of what was going
to happen in that part of the world.

55
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:22,180
There was a conference held on the
island of Samos perhaps one of the most

56
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:28,211
important of the Ionian Islands off the
coast which brought to the to the to the

57
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:35,000
Greek Council that had
been conducting the war.

58
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:40,630
It brought the island states
of chaos Lesbos and Samos.

59
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:46,690
These are the three largest most
important islands that are located off the

60
00:05:47,121 --> 00:05:48,590
coast of Asia Minor.

61
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,110
All of them had taken advantage of the
presence of the Greek forces in that

62
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:56,990
region to rebel against the Persians.

63
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,380
And now they wanted to be admitted to
the league that the Greeks had formed in

64
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:09,701
for any one to resist the Persian invasion
the Greeks referred to themselves to

65
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:14,921
that league simply as the hellions the
Greeks and it's convenient to think about

66
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:22,031
it as the Greek league meant to
fight the Persians in that war.

67
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Now this might seem like a simple thing
to do why not accept these three Greek

68
00:06:30,461 --> 00:06:35,461
states all of them potentially powerful
and important who want to join the Greek

69
00:06:35,501 --> 00:06:36,334
league.

70
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,610
One thing I think we need to understand
at once that we won't comprehend the

71
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:43,810
situation at all.
We know that the Persian Wars are over.

72
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,650
We know that the Persians just ran
away and weren't going to come back and

73
00:06:47,651 --> 00:06:51,940
challenge this Greek victory
for the longest time.

74
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,220
But the Greeks didn't know it.

75
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:00,150
The Persian Empire was still intact it
was still an extraordinarily extensive

76
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:03,380
rich and powerful empire.

77
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,140
There was no reason why the Greeks should
not believe that the Persians would be

78
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:09,974
coming again.

79
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,630
And if we don't grasp that then all
of what they do now makes no sense.

80
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,980
Well chaos Samos and lemon and Lesbos
wanted to be sure that they would be

81
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:24,440
protected by this Greek league.

82
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:29,510
If and when the Persians came back and
tried to put them back into the Persian

83
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,660
Empire and so there was a conference
but there was not a unity of intention.

84
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,630
When the Greeks have to discuss shall
we take these people into our league

85
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,600
basically the Spartans said no.

86
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,440
And the reasons for that
I'm not so very strange.

87
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,980
The Spartans certainly could conclude
with security that there wasn't very much

88
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:59,921
danger that in the foreseeable future
the Persians would come marching into

89
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:05,051
Greece again and and present a threat
to the Peloponnese and to the Spartan

90
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,430
predominance in that area.

91
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:13,010
And we all know by now that the Spartans
were most reluctant to be far from home

92
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:18,040
anyway didn't like to have to cross the
sea to get to a battlefield and didn't

93
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:22,520
want their army out there
on any permanent basis.

94
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:27,550
Everything in their tradition said
bring the army home put an end to this

95
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:32,930
activity and they didn't want
to take on the responsibility of

96
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:40,130
bringing these islanders into their
league so that they would have to go and

97
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:45,131
fight for their freedom on the other hand
the Athenians took the opposite view.

98
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:51,770
They were very much in favor of
bringing these states into this thing.

99
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,630
Is this thing working. Is this
normal. Can you hear me back there.

100
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,650
Nothing's happening up here.
You want to forward this.

101
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,930
I can't tell. No it's not
working. A little bit all right.

102
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,920
Anyway I'll just continue to talk.
While technology takes place.

103
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,703
Mm hmm.

104
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,030
Anyway the Athenians thought differently
and that's not surprising either

105
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:31,630
because their situation was quite
different from that of the Spartans.

106
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:37,700
They were. On the sea. They
were accustomed to be at sea.

107
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Moreover as we've seen and said several
times they had very important supply

108
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:46,870
line like.

109
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,560
Lines of communication and transportation
in order to feed themselves they

110
00:09:54,951 --> 00:09:59,720
needed to go out there and have freedom
of the seas and that meant that they had

111
00:09:59,721 --> 00:10:04,721
to see to it that the Persians were
indeed driven from the Aegean Sea and the

112
00:10:05,241 --> 00:10:06,500
hellish spot.
And yet

113
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,030
the straits in general and
the access to the Black Sea.

114
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:16,090
So for those reasons alone the Athenians
would have had to take seriously this

115
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,300
request by the islanders.

116
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,340
But it's also true that at least some
of the islanders Samos particularly were

117
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,623
Ionian.

118
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,030
As you remember kinsman of the Athenians
the Athenians were recognized as the

119
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,590
leader of the Ionian people.

120
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,680
So there was that that
sentimental attachment as well.

121
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:43,180
But most strikingly I think we have to
understand that the Athenians understood

122
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:49,090
the Persians have to be kept away from
the Aegean Sea and the Athenians also

123
00:10:51,411 --> 00:10:56,411
wanted very much because ever since
the rebellion of 499 the Athenians had

124
00:10:56,511 --> 00:10:57,500
wanted to liberate.

125
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:04,070
The Greeks of Asia Minor
from the Persian rule.

126
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,900
You've got.
Thanks very much so.

127
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,000
And the Athenians won the argument.

128
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:19,230
It was agreed to take these three island
states into the Greek league and that

129
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:25,201
meant that the Greeks would be committed
to protect them should the Persians

130
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,440
attack them again and in accordance with
these decisions the commander of the

131
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:37,291
Spartan fleet out there kingly O ticket
has sailed home and took his Spartans.

132
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,030
And I would imagine this helping
nations with him on the other hand the

133
00:11:43,031 --> 00:11:48,031
commander of the Athenian fleet sent
sippers state and carried on the war

134
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,470
against the Persians in the area. Let
me just give you a small clue since us.

135
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,140
We'll have a son.
Sorry.

136
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,200
He has a son in the here for 79 whose
name is parrot Cleaves and we will be

137
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:08,321
hearing of course a lot about him later
on since it is the Persians have fled

138
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,850
but there are a few places in Europe
that along the road the route of their

139
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:21,751
escape where the Persians left still
had control of a town or a city here and

140
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:23,020
there.

141
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:28,020
And one of the most important was the
town of systems located on the European

142
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:34,591
side of the the Dardanelles and so
sand Cyprus besieged the city with the

143
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:42,130
Athenian and the rest the Navy and the
rest of the Greek ships that were still

144
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:42,964
there.

145
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And after a while took the city by siege
and cleared the Persians out of their

146
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:56,580
the result of the war was of course first
of all the vindication a validation of

147
00:12:58,451 --> 00:12:59,740
Greek freedom.

148
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,040
Greeks would indeed continue to be able
to live the lives that they had been

149
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,680
accustomed to but another
thing had happened which was
going to make an enormous

150
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,930
impact on Greek life.

151
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:19,930
You perhaps will remember that before
the Persian invasion but not long before.

152
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,860
I believe it's in the year for 82 to the
silver mines in the south of Attica had

153
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:32,550
yielded an unusual strike a vein of
silver had been discovered that was much

154
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:34,594
more than normal.

155
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,940
And so much so that something had to
be decided by the Athenian assembly

156
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,690
what shall we do with the silver.

157
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,060
And this is a wonderful insight into the
way Greeks thought about their place at

158
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:49,960
the first thought.

159
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:55,530
The one that was most popular to begin
with was well let's take the silver and

160
00:13:56,921 --> 00:14:01,921
divide it up equally among the Athenians
that in some sense the the polls was a

161
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:07,970
kind of a joint stock company and when
there was a nice dividend you just doled

162
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,370
out to the investors.

163
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:15,890
So Mr. Cleese thought otherwise mystically
as was it's evident constantly aware

164
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,970
of the threat from Persia and of the
importance of getting ready to fight the

165
00:14:22,971 --> 00:14:23,804
Persians.

166
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,640
Then he understood I think before most
other Greeks that the Navy was going to

167
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:34,290
be really critical in this operation.

168
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,680
And so he made the suggestion that the
silver strike be used to build a whole

169
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:45,981
fleet of new ships for the Athenians and
they end up with two hundred try rings

170
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,540
which is to the tri RIM is the
battleship of the ancient Greeks.

171
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,280
So that.

172
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:01,910
That is the core of the fleet which is
the one that defeats the Persians at

173
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:08,571
salaries and defeats them again at my
Kelly the Spartans were given command of

174
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:12,470
the war against Persia
both on land and sea.

175
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,160
But the Spartans didn't have any great
skill or experience in naval matters.

176
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:23,230
And the Athenians had more than they
and it was the Athenian portion of the

177
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:28,751
fleet which was the largest and the
most effective in fighting those naval

178
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:33,530
battles and of course the battle of
Solomon was fought in Athenian waters.

179
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:38,890
And so Mr. Cleaves with his clever
devices had come up with a way of winning

180
00:15:40,011 --> 00:15:40,670
victory.

181
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:44,510
First of all compelling the Greeks to
fight its elements and then winning the

182
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:45,420
victory itself.

183
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,000
Now the point of all this is one of the
changes that has come upon the Greek

184
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:54,170
world as a result of this Persian invasion
is that there is something new in the

185
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:59,171
Greek world a big Athenian Navy
and it has proven itself already

186
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,340
to be an extraordinarily capable Navy.

187
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,160
And that is a new power factor.

188
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:15,430
And the whole idea of naval power being
very decisive in Greek affairs is a

189
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:18,890
relatively new idea.

190
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,270
That's not to say that there weren't
states that had navies before and naval

191
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:26,330
battles and in some cases that
these were very important.

192
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,880
But we're really at another level.

193
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:33,620
After the Athenians have built this
fleet and had the success that they have

194
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,673
made they had.

195
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:41,470
And another consequence of the
war was of course the tremendous

196
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:49,090
boom that came in Greek
self-confidence it really.

197
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,160
I can't emphasize enough
what an incredible upset
this was no one would have

198
00:16:55,161 --> 00:17:00,161
imagined that if the great king was got
really serious and sent over an army of

199
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,350
well you know one hundred thousand two
hundred thousand nobody knows exactly how

200
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:07,940
many Herodotus his numbers are.

201
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:13,450
It is widely agreed exaggerated
but there's a very big
army and a very big Navy

202
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,850
certainly outnumbers the
Greeks in both cases.

203
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,460
And if anybody would have thought that
was going to be an easy victory for the

204
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:26,800
Persians to defeat that
meant an enormous amount.

205
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,870
And the Greeks came away feeling that
their general prejudice of their own

206
00:17:31,871 --> 00:17:36,871
superiority over everybody else had been
justified by their performance in the

207
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,700
Persian Wars the Athenians no less.

208
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,480
Of course because of the very
central role that they had played.

209
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:50,010
So all of these are new things that are
in the hearts and minds of the Greeks

210
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:52,480
and by no means trivial.

211
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,760
There was a sense that the Greeks had
done something remarkably glorious not to

212
00:17:57,761 --> 00:18:02,680
be forgotten which made them proud and
made them I think also rather ambitious

213
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,050
to continue in that course.

214
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:10,410
And finally one other point I would want
to make in that is this is the first

215
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:16,140
great pan hellenic activity really.

216
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:21,810
There had been some sense in which the
Greeks were increasingly aware that there

217
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:27,000
was something called
Helen's Greek people's.

218
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,240
Different from people
who were not hellions.

219
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:36,150
And this took probably took shape most
fully when they competed in the major

220
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:42,750
athletic contests at major religious
festivals in which they were fundamentally

221
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,110
Greek even though.
Well they were entirely Greek really.

222
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,700
So that would have fostered
this sense of handhelds.

223
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:55,860
But nothing could have given
it a tremendous boost that
it got like this victory

224
00:18:56,291 --> 00:19:01,291
of these 31 states that had
banded together to defeat
the Persians in that war.

225
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,290
So Pan Helen ism is now on the horizon.

226
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,990
I don't mean to say that
the Greeks are shaped now.

227
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:13,510
Into a single people have retreated from
their localism and their love for the

228
00:19:13,511 --> 00:19:15,560
Poles.
Nothing could be further from the truth.

229
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,640
But alongside of their love of autonomy
and love of their place there was the

230
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:25,660
idea that pan Helen ism was a good thing.

231
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,130
It had a kind of a nice ring to it.

232
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's the sort of thing that
I feel some familiarity with.

233
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,480
Not that I was around right
after the first world war but

234
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:45,220
reading about it you realized that
there was some sense after that war.

235
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:51,290
That the victorious peoples had something
in common and that in any case they

236
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:57,351
could work together to
achieve international peace
and in a way that hadn't been

237
00:19:58,561 --> 00:20:00,150
thought of much before.

238
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,660
But even more strongly I think the idea
after the Second World War when this

239
00:20:07,321 --> 00:20:12,321
idea took even stronger route to the
point where people have this crazy

240
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:18,020
religious feeling or at least some of
them do about the desire to avoid having

241
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:26,450
parochial national interests determine
what you're going to do in international

242
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:28,374
relations.

243
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:33,410
Everything has to be done
somehow as though there were
a rule a world government

244
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,950
that really existed and really managed
things and although everybody knows

245
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:42,630
that's not true it's thought to
be bad form to face that fact.

246
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,300
Well something like that kind.

247
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:51,510
Not as bad as that but something like
that kind of unreality was in the minds of

248
00:20:51,511 --> 00:20:56,511
Greeks because you will be hearing over
the next century various thinkers and

249
00:20:56,701 --> 00:21:01,701
speakers who want to make the case that
a thing is good if it's somehow pan

250
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,140
hellenic. That's a fine thing.
So it's an idea that's there.

251
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,420
Not that any state any more than our
nations have given up any sovereignty or

252
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:17,920
any independence or any autonomy.
It's an idea and that's all that it is.

253
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:26,860
Another consequence of the war was a
division in the Greek within the Greek

254
00:21:29,991 --> 00:21:34,991
world that was in part based upon the
fact that Athens said Come on in that war

255
00:21:39,661 --> 00:21:41,640
to become a great power.

256
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:47,570
And by anybody's reckoning had played
one of the leading roles in the victory.

257
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,640
Now the Spartans had to the Spartans were
the official leaders and their Regent

258
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,200
had been the commander at the great land
battle at Pelletier and their general

259
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:04,920
was in charge of the Navy.

260
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,700
But Athens had become so important so
big so successful that there was now a

261
00:22:12,301 --> 00:22:13,134
question.

262
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:18,720
I mean it was part of really the leader
of the Greeks. What was the future.

263
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,860
Was the future going to be one in which
the Spartans would maintain the unique

264
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:26,250
leadership of the Greeks or would
the Athenians challenge them.

265
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:31,580
It soon became clear that the Athenians
would indeed challenge them and so a

266
00:22:32,371 --> 00:22:37,350
major theme may be the major theme in
international relations for the next 50

267
00:22:37,351 --> 00:22:42,351
years will be the conflict
between Athens and Sparta.

268
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,430
And a lot of it I think could be
described really as a Cold War.

269
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:52,970
Because there is no fighting between the
two states between for 79 and about 460

270
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,990
or even a little bit late.

271
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:00,350
Actually I don't come into conflict
themselves until four fifty seven again.

272
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,730
And when that war stops there is a period
once again of peace and then we come

273
00:23:05,731 --> 00:23:10,650
to the great Peloponnesian War which
dominates the last third of the century.

274
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,300
That's all in the future.

275
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:17,570
But what's clear now is that there's
got to be some new arrangement some new

276
00:23:18,241 --> 00:23:23,241
alignment to face up to the
change in the power structure.

277
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,310
There was only one great
power before the war.

278
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,910
There clearly are two after the war.

279
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:37,330
Well the Greeks also had to decide
certain questions that had been created by

280
00:23:37,401 --> 00:23:38,090
the war.

281
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,600
One of them who's to be the leader if
there is to be a leader of the Greeks.

282
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:46,630
But beyond that there was some Greek
states that had gone over to the Persians

283
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,820
in the course of the war and the
Greeks refer to these people as me or.

284
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,680
What should be done with the me dies.

285
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,920
I'm sure there were proposals from one
extreme that would have said just wipe

286
00:24:00,951 --> 00:24:05,951
those cities out to the other extreme
which would have said well let bygones be

287
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:06,950
bygones.

288
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:11,910
But there were opinions all
along the middle of the way.

289
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:16,670
And so that remained an issue
that had to be settled somehow.

290
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:22,750
And then behind it all was the question
What shall we look for in the future.

291
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:31,220
Was Persia going to be a threat once
again which would imply one whole set of

292
00:24:33,031 --> 00:24:38,031
policies or can we consider the threat
from Persia finished so that we can go

293
00:24:38,821 --> 00:24:43,440
back to our normal way without
adjusting to that policy.

294
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:49,250
And in for the reasons I've already
indicated the Spartans and the the nations

295
00:24:49,381 --> 00:24:54,210
who have a lot more likely to take
the view that the threat was over the

296
00:24:54,211 --> 00:24:59,211
Athenians the islanders and the Ionian
and the I should say the Asiatic Greeks

297
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:05,360
would take the view that no there is a
very imminent danger from the Persians.

298
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:11,790
The war isn't over.
We need to continue to fight it.

299
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:18,320
Now let me then try to
describe the way in which a new

300
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,450
way of dealing with the Persians would
come onto the scene and for that I need

301
00:25:24,451 --> 00:25:29,451
to take you back to for any one year
when Xerxes started his march from the

302
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:35,880
Persian empire against the Greeks.

303
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,490
The Greeks knew this was
happening and they met.

304
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,520
You will remember at Corinth in 481 when
those 31 cities came together and swore

305
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,250
that they would fight together
to defeat the Persians.

306
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,260
They appointed Sparta.

307
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,920
Officially as the head Jarmon the leader
of that league which meant that the

308
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:04,191
Spartans would be in command on land and
sea and once the battles commenced that

309
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:06,600
they would be in charge.

310
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:11,630
But of course the decisions as to what
to do what where to go to fight went to

311
00:26:13,231 --> 00:26:18,231
fight and so on were made by the Council
of Greeks who were participating in the

312
00:26:19,591 --> 00:26:23,940
Spartans did not attempt
to impose their wishes.

313
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:28,500
At that point so that the league really
functions like a league of equals but of

314
00:26:28,501 --> 00:26:30,660
course the states are
not equal in their power.

315
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,380
So that is much more
influenced by the Spartans.

316
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:38,220
But there's also a lot of influence by
the Athenians because of the size of

317
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,054
their fleet.

318
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:43,680
That's the way things were working
in the Greek league against Persia.

319
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,230
Even though the Spartans are the hedge
German Do not confuse this league with

320
00:26:49,231 --> 00:26:52,920
the Peloponnesian league.
It is something quite different.

321
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,820
I've already described the league to you
and so you know that the relationships

322
00:26:56,821 --> 00:26:59,280
are different and the
membership is different.

323
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,110
The Greek league has states that are
not in the Peloponnese and have not

324
00:27:04,111 --> 00:27:05,820
previously been allied to Sparta.

325
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,600
It also includes Spartans traditional
Peloponnesian allies they swear this

326
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:14,820
common oath the Greeks

327
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:21,540
are to fight for the common freedom to
free the Greeks and the islands and Asia

328
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:26,881
Minor and it is to be a perpetual League
as we know because as late as four

329
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,000
sixty one.

330
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:38,250
I guess the when there was a conflict
between Athens and Sparta the Athenians in

331
00:27:39,221 --> 00:27:44,221
fact withdraw from their alliance
with the Greeks under Spartan rules.

332
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:51,180
So that tells us that until then they
fell for themselves still to be part of

333
00:27:51,191 --> 00:27:56,191
that Greek league they agreed and for
anyone to put aside the quarrels that they

334
00:27:57,251 --> 00:28:02,050
may have had at the time and to have
the same friends and enemies the famous

335
00:28:02,051 --> 00:28:06,320
clause that means a common foreign policy.

336
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:10,690
But it doesn't mean again it just because
the Spartans ahead us doesn't mean the

337
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:14,770
Spartans will determine that policy the
policy will be determined by the league

338
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:20,160
in its own meetings it is to
be a typical Greek alliance.

339
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,970
The Greek word for that is simple.

340
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:28,810
Here it means an offensive
and defensive alliance.

341
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,970
I will fight along your side
not only if you are attacked.

342
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:37,360
But if you go to war against
somebody else at your own discretion.

343
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,700
I still am bound to be your ally.

344
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:43,210
That's what I say mafia is so far
as we know that's the only kind of

345
00:28:43,211 --> 00:28:45,460
international alliance
that the Greeks knew.

346
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,670
Up to that time offensive and defensive

347
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,590
nothing is said about money.

348
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:58,110
There is no provision for
providing funds for the league.

349
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:03,470
I think that implies very clearly each
state would pay for its own forces when

350
00:29:04,531 --> 00:29:07,350
they were engaged in the common cause.

351
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,250
There was no provision
for regular meetings.

352
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,880
Meetings would be held when they
were thought to be necessary.

353
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:21,630
And of course everything would have
to be done by the common consent.

354
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:27,140
I don't mean that there was a need for
unanimity but there certainly would have

355
00:29:28,021 --> 00:29:32,250
to be a general agreement of things.
For the game to go forward.

356
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,200
This is a new thing.

357
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,300
It's an innovation and of course it fits
in nicely with what I said a moment ago

358
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,630
about the concept of Pan
Helen ism coming forward.

359
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:47,990
This is the first pan hellenic
expedition I suppose since the Trojan War

360
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:55,920
now.
Sparta.

361
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,940
As as you've seen when the decision had
to be made as to whether they should

362
00:30:02,121 --> 00:30:07,121
commit themselves to defending the islands
with a kind of a permanent force out

363
00:30:07,281 --> 00:30:10,130
there to do that the Spartans withdrew.

364
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,760
Nothing is formal there's no change in
the arrangements but they just decided to

365
00:30:14,761 --> 00:30:15,594
go home.

366
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:21,460
And now we see that the Athenians
will be pursuing a different policy.

367
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:26,710
The one that was ultimately adopted by
most of the Greeks but which allowed the

368
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:31,610
Athenians to come forward and make the
kinds of claims for their influence that

369
00:30:31,611 --> 00:30:35,540
they would one of the first
things the Athenians wanted to do.

370
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:40,860
I should remind you that the Persians
had marched into Attica and done fearful

371
00:30:42,051 --> 00:30:47,051
damage to the police of Athens the palace
of Athens and had done great harm to

372
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:55,070
the city of Athens had gone up to the
Acropolis destroyed the temples that

373
00:30:55,071 --> 00:31:00,071
existed there a terrible sacrilege from
the point of view of the Athenians and

374
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:04,820
they wanted to do what they could to
see this would never happen again.

375
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,840
And so they undertook to
build the walls around the.

376
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:18,080
I hope it's going to come to
me in a minute the Acropolis
stronger than they had

377
00:31:20,091 --> 00:31:20,810
been.

378
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:25,520
And also to make the city walls
stronger than they had been.

379
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:31,470
Now it's interesting it's an interesting
sign of the way some of the other Greek

380
00:31:31,471 --> 00:31:36,471
states felt that when the Athenians set
about building their walls there were

381
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:42,981
complaints from some of the Greek allies
to the Spartans that the Athenians were

382
00:31:44,851 --> 00:31:48,090
doing this and saying this was a bad idea.

383
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:53,930
My guess is that the complainants would
have included such cities as thieves

384
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,360
Majora probably currents thieves and
mega of being both neighbors a budding on

385
00:32:01,831 --> 00:32:06,831
Attica and old enemies of the Athenians
and the Corinthians being just next door

386
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:09,563
so to speak.

387
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:15,110
Not quite on their border but also a
state that was undoubted will undoubtedly

388
00:32:15,691 --> 00:32:20,670
challenge by the emergence of Athens
as a great naval power and a great

389
00:32:20,671 --> 00:32:21,600
commercial power.

390
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:27,030
Currents had happened that had one of
the biggest navies and cards for the

391
00:32:27,421 --> 00:32:29,610
longest time had been a
great commercial power.

392
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:35,890
The archeological evidence is that it was
being challenged in the latter respect

393
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,400
by the Athenians as early
as in the 6th century.

394
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:43,540
So these are the kind of states that
would have been complaining and thinking

395
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:48,370
that if the Athenians had a walled city
that they could defend that would make

396
00:32:48,371 --> 00:32:49,204
them more

397
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:55,590
confident and possibly more aggressive
and more trouble for their neighbors

398
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:03,510
and in the war the Athenians should had
shown an astonishing daring especially

399
00:33:05,471 --> 00:33:10,471
at sea which obviously was making some
of their old enemies and neighbors

400
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:16,120
nervous Well the Spartans

401
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:22,670
heard about it and they heeded
their friend's complaints enough.

402
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:25,850
So that's the mistake please.

403
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:31,700
Who was I need to point out to you though
I'm sure you know it emerged from the

404
00:33:32,131 --> 00:33:34,320
war as the great hero.

405
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,570
He had done so many wonderful things.

406
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:40,350
He was responsible for the Athenian Navy.

407
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,290
He was responsible for the
decision to fight at Salomon.

408
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,700
He was responsible people believe
for the victory it's Alan as

409
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:49,920
we hear.

410
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:54,900
Butcher tells wonderful stories about in
the Olympic Games right after the war.

411
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,100
People will watching the games
when the mystically is arrive.

412
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,070
They stop watching the games
and they watch domestically.

413
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:07,040
Because so great was the admiration
and wonder that he created.

414
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,820
I always I try to figure out some analogy
now but I can't if you imagine if you

415
00:34:11,821 --> 00:34:16,821
could wrap up Roosevelt Churchill and
Stalin and make him one person after a

416
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:21,900
second world war. You might have
something like what mystically is dead.

417
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:24,200
So so mystically goes to Sparta.

418
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:30,450
And he of course is the main champion
in Athens of Athens rebuilding its walls

419
00:34:31,741 --> 00:34:36,570
as fast as possible and Athens taking
the most forward position possible in the

420
00:34:36,571 --> 00:34:40,740
Navy at sea and in international
relations in general.

421
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,980
And he does this little trick
that the facilities described.

422
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:50,420
He says he will go to to Sparta but
the Spartans either send some people to

423
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:52,730
Athens too.

424
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,590
And then he tells the Athenians to hold
those Spartans there until he gets home.

425
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:04,060
The next thing he says is let me know
when the walls have been built high enough

426
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,590
to defend so he goes to talk to the
Spartans as fights as we hear you guys are

427
00:35:09,591 --> 00:35:10,940
building walls around there.

428
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:14,630
You know I know it's your own business
but we don't think that's a good idea

429
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:19,370
because if the Persians come again they
could use your walled city as a base

430
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:23,150
against us if you can follow
that kind of reasoning.

431
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,070
Your sharper than I am.
But

432
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,960
anyway that's the story
they told isn't it.

433
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,440
Where did you hear that nonsense. We're
building walls up. A lot of baloney.

434
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,650
Forget about it. I'm sorry I
haven't told the story quite right.

435
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,570
He says Look don't take my word for it.

436
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,440
You send an embassy to Athens and take
a look. That's when he told his friends.

437
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,300
Keep those guys there until I get home.

438
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:49,160
So one day the message I'm a messenger
from Athens comes to the mystic leaves

439
00:35:49,161 --> 00:35:50,300
and tells him OK.

440
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:55,520
The walls can now be defended whereupon
mystically says to the Spartans you know

441
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:58,370
those walls you were complaining about.
You were right.

442
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,920
We do have them and they're now big enough
that we can defend ourselves against

443
00:36:03,921 --> 00:36:04,750
them.

444
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:09,670
And what are you going to do about and
then he delivers a speech which is a kind

445
00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:14,320
of a declaration not so much of
independence as of equivalence

446
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:16,720
to the Spartans.

447
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,720
His message was we don't take orders
from you keep your advice to yourselves.

448
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,990
We'll take care of ourselves.
You take care of yourselves.

449
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,600
You are not our superiors.

450
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,590
We are your equals was the
essence of what he said.

451
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:36,820
Thereafter Mr. it was not so
popular in Sparta as it used to be.

452
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:42,610
Indeed for the rest of his life the
Spartans will be trying to do him harm and

453
00:36:42,611 --> 00:36:47,380
remove him from the scene.
But he certainly achieves what he wants.

454
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:52,870
The Athenians are a walled city and
they have declared that whatever their

455
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:57,970
formal technical relationship with Sparta
might be under the Hellenic League.

456
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:03,160
The fact is they are independent players
and they're going to do things as they

457
00:37:03,161 --> 00:37:04,180
see fit.

458
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:10,110
Consider this says the Spartans accepted
this but secretly they were embittered.

459
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:19,410
I think that's the first clue we have to
what will become a continuing situation

460
00:37:20,801 --> 00:37:25,750
in Sparta for the rest of the time we pay
attention to them that there will be a

461
00:37:25,751 --> 00:37:28,150
factional division among Spartans.

462
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,820
At least this much is true.

463
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:35,940
I'm sure it's much more complicated than
we know but in the simplest way there

464
00:37:36,011 --> 00:37:41,011
was some Spartans who were content to
withdraw back to the Peloponnese is to

465
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:48,060
have nothing to do with the world outside
the Peloponnese is much less with the

466
00:37:48,761 --> 00:37:53,761
world of the Aegean Sea and beyond and
try to return to their traditional ways.

467
00:37:55,060 --> 00:38:00,060
A peace faction if you will a conservative
faction perhaps but that there is

468
00:38:00,161 --> 00:38:04,130
also starting now as a result
of the victory in the war.

469
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:10,170
A faction of Spartans that would like to
exert Spartan power and influence more

470
00:38:11,681 --> 00:38:12,514
broadly.

471
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,880
At least to incur include the rest of
the Greek states of the mainland but also

472
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:23,700
a number of them surely felt that
they wanted to exert power everywhere

473
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,710
including overseas as well.

474
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:32,910
But that that faction that second faction
doesn't win the argument they have to

475
00:38:33,101 --> 00:38:38,101
be secretly embittered
because the official policy
of Sparta is to accept this.

476
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,970
The Athenian situation and we'll see in
a moment that events move them in the

477
00:38:42,971 --> 00:38:44,320
same direction.

478
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:50,130
The commander of the Spartan forces at
play here who emerges as the leading

479
00:38:50,651 --> 00:38:55,651
figure immediately after the war he is
POW seniors who was there a region but

480
00:38:57,731 --> 00:39:01,930
effectively one of the two kings of.
Sparta.

481
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,600
He goes out to the Aegean Sea.

482
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:09,790
Member of the previous king in commander
had retired but now pass any it takes a

483
00:39:10,991 --> 00:39:15,991
fleet and he goes out there and he
proceeds to make the Greeks first he

484
00:39:17,891 --> 00:39:20,110
perceives to be very effective
against the Persians.

485
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:26,820
He does some fighting particularly in
the hellish spot and the Straits in

486
00:39:26,921 --> 00:39:30,400
general Byzantium is a
very important city there.

487
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:35,670
What later becomes Constantinople and
then Istanbul and the and the little town

488
00:39:35,681 --> 00:39:37,780
across the way so they
control the Straits.

489
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:43,230
He defeats the Persians and so on but in
the process he makes enemies among the

490
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:50,791
Greeks part of the reason is because
he treats the Greeks as inferiors as if

491
00:39:53,381 --> 00:39:56,480
they were underlings of the Spartans.

492
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:02,490
In general it appears to have been a
common Spartan problem that when they went

493
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:08,910
out of Sparta and had commanding
positions over other Greeks they regularly

494
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:14,790
treated them in that way different degrees
of course poor seniors must have been

495
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:17,360
particularly annoying.

496
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:22,770
But there were main complaints about how
they were treated by his Greek allies.

497
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,160
In addition he became very much caught
up in the great wealth and luxury that

498
00:40:33,451 --> 00:40:36,210
the Persians demonstrated.

499
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:43,370
Greeks were most Greeks were at least
theoretically very appalled at the morals

500
00:40:45,091 --> 00:40:49,440
or the lack of morals of the Persians
from their perspective but their Persians

501
00:40:49,441 --> 00:40:52,860
were first of all very
rich and Greeks were not.

502
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:58,820
And they use their wealth for various
purposes all of which were seen to be on

503
00:40:59,671 --> 00:41:03,090
Greek and unattractive
parsimonious fell for it.

504
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:08,750
And he began behaving as though he were
a Persian sat track at the very least.

505
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,980
All of these things as I say irritated
their fellow Greeks who began to bring

506
00:41:13,981 --> 00:41:15,270
charges against him.

507
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:20,870
He was charged in Sparta with first
of all tyranny and then second of all

508
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:22,643
treason.

509
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:27,750
He was alleged to have been cut out to
have cut some kind of a deal with the

510
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:32,730
Persian ruler and his set
traps against the common cause.

511
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:37,530
The this was effective enough to
have him recall and put on trial.

512
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:41,520
He was acquitted on the other hand.

513
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,360
He was not sent out again
to be the commander.

514
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,190
He was put on the side.

515
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:52,440
Later on further charges would be brought
against him and he would indeed be put

516
00:41:52,441 --> 00:41:54,790
to death.
OK.

517
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:58,880
But the main point is that the Spartans
have withdrawn their commander pretty

518
00:41:58,881 --> 00:42:02,390
much in disgrace with
the rest of the Greeks.

519
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,710
They send out a replacement.
A man called Dorcas.

520
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:12,670
The allies don't accept him and they
say no we're not taking any Spartan

521
00:42:13,161 --> 00:42:16,190
commanders these days
and send him back home.

522
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,270
That is an extremely important step.

523
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:22,490
The allies.

524
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:27,730
And that means now the people in the
Aegean Sea and on its borders the people

525
00:42:29,571 --> 00:42:34,430
who are in what will be first the
Athenian sphere of influence and then the

526
00:42:34,431 --> 00:42:39,260
Athenian Empire. These are the states
that they that don't want Spartan rule.

527
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,340
And I think the main reason is well
there's a couple of reasons one is a the

528
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:47,900
behavior of past enemies has discredited
the Spartans but the other I think is

529
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:52,901
this look how much evidence do you need
that the Spartans really don't like this

530
00:42:54,211 --> 00:42:54,780
kind of thing.

531
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,380
You remember they had voted against
taking those three islands into the league

532
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:02,170
even back there in 479.
So.

533
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:06,540
And the other thing is that here are the
Athenians the guys who really won the

534
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:11,541
war at sea which is the one
you're concerned about and
who are apparently ready

535
00:43:11,551 --> 00:43:13,830
and waiting to continue to do that.

536
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:18,870
And it was I think that choice that was
in the minds of the allies when they

537
00:43:18,871 --> 00:43:22,230
sent Dorcas home and said please no more.

538
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:26,550
And the Spartans did not send
a replacement for Dorcas.

539
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:32,580
They in other words accepted that they
would not participate in the future

540
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:38,180
campaigns against Persia which would be
obviously aggressive campaigns in Asia

541
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,340
since the Persians had been driven out
of Europe and out of the Aegean Sea.

542
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:49,160
Facility says this about
the Spartan decision.

543
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:55,840
They also wanted to be rid of the Persian
War and believed that the Athenians

544
00:43:58,161 --> 00:44:03,161
were competent to lead and were at
the present time well-disposed to the

545
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:08,630
Spartans. Why not. They said we
don't want to fight this war.

546
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,430
We don't really care about those things
and everything will be OK because the

547
00:44:13,431 --> 00:44:18,431
Athenians can do it and
they're all friends but surely
that was not what all the

548
00:44:19,581 --> 00:44:20,414
Spartans saw.

549
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:28,100
That was the opinion of the faction
that won the argument which was the

550
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:33,080
conservative faction the one
that was the peace party.

551
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:38,140
And let's stay in the Peloponnese party
was still the predominant force and I

552
00:44:38,781 --> 00:44:43,781
suspect their position had
been strengthened by the
disgrace brought upon Sparta

553
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:50,470
by the behavior of seniors and no
doubt by the rejection of the Spartan

554
00:44:51,501 --> 00:44:54,680
replacement by the other Greeks.
Why should we force ourselves.

555
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:58,000
We are making ourselves unpopular.

556
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:03,610
It used to be the Greeks came to us and
begged us to fight and protect them when

557
00:45:03,681 --> 00:45:06,530
they were in trouble.
And now they're rejecting our leadership.

558
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,540
That's because we shouldn't be out there.
This is not our kind of a campaign.

559
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:16,580
This is. Well what can go on and
imagine the arguments that we use

560
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:24,250
did this mean that there would be no
continuing campaign against Persia.

561
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,060
Certainly not.
That is not what the allies meant.

562
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:33,300
They turned to Athens and asked the
Athenians to take the lead in the war that

563
00:45:35,091 --> 00:45:36,000
was going to cost

564
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,920
Herodotus has a line in which he says
the Athenians offered the hubris of power

565
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:51,710
seniors as a pretext for taking over the
leadership of the Greeks out there that

566
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:59,121
suggests that the Athenians were planning
to do just that that they very much

567
00:46:00,121 --> 00:46:05,121
wanted to and that they were engaged
in maneuvers to bring it about.

568
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:08,790
That it was their idea that
they took the initiative.

569
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:17,360
But I think that's not right. I let me
back up a step. It's only partly right.

570
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:22,400
What is certainly clear
is that the Athenians were
ready and willing to do what

571
00:46:22,401 --> 00:46:27,401
they were asked but the idea that they
either use their power and influence or

572
00:46:28,581 --> 00:46:33,110
their wiles to bring the allies to take
that decision when they would not have

573
00:46:33,111 --> 00:46:35,660
otherwise done so.
I think that is wrong.

574
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:40,520
I'm gonna start doing something
that you may get tired of after a.

575
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:44,630
I want to use an analogy that I
find very illuminating anyway.

576
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:50,470
The analogy of the formation of NATO
after the Second World War and the

577
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:57,671
formation of the deeply in League which
is ultimately turned into the Athenian

578
00:46:58,071 --> 00:47:00,500
Empire after the Persian Wars

579
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:07,770
in the case of the dealing league I think
the Norwegian or Swedish scholar has

580
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:13,050
described the process whereby NATO was
invented as the establishment of head

581
00:47:16,961 --> 00:47:19,780
Germany by invitation.

582
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:24,720
That is if you look at the situation
nineteen forty five six seven eight nine

583
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:30,240
the European states that ultimately
became part of NATO desperately wanted the

584
00:47:31,811 --> 00:47:36,640
Americans to join with them not to
repeat what they had done after the first

585
00:47:36,641 --> 00:47:41,641
world war which was to retreat back into
North America to have no connections of

586
00:47:43,901 --> 00:47:48,901
a political military kind with Europe
which terrified the European states that

587
00:47:50,861 --> 00:47:55,090
were sort of knocked down so hard by
the Second World War and who were afraid

588
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:59,680
that the Soviet Union was going to take
them over and they desperately wanted

589
00:47:59,681 --> 00:48:04,000
the Americans to take the lead.
Now the Americans were glad to do it.

590
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:05,860
I don't mean all the Americans.

591
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:10,960
As always there were factions and the
differences of opinions and the the

592
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:15,640
American president and his government had
to fight hard to convince Americans to

593
00:48:15,641 --> 00:48:15,880
do it.

594
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:20,880
But by and large they did and those who
won the argument were of the opinion

595
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:25,950
that American interests first of all
in reaching restoring Europe to its

596
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:32,370
previous condition and
secondly to resisting communist
takeover Soviet takeover

597
00:48:33,851 --> 00:48:38,590
of Europe meant that it was in America's
interests to see that such a situation

598
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:43,860
develop both sides I would argue were
equally glad to see what happened because

599
00:48:45,371 --> 00:48:47,500
it was in the interest of both sides.

600
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,400
So I think it was in for seven to eight
seven when the formation of the Dalian

601
00:48:56,441 --> 00:48:57,310
League took place.

602
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:03,850
Obviously the states that were bordering
on the Persian Empire and in the seas

603
00:49:03,851 --> 00:49:08,851
next to Asia Minor were absolutely
at risk if the Persians came back.

604
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:14,830
Supposing the Athenians said they weren't
interested and had gone home just as

605
00:49:14,831 --> 00:49:19,750
the Persians said there was no Greek
force except for the poor Asiatic Greeks

606
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:23,940
themselves to resist a Persian return
and they couldn't possibly resist that.

607
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:28,870
So for them it was a life and death
matter at least it was a matter of freedom

608
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:33,160
versus slavery that they should
persuade the Athenians to take the lead.

609
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:38,820
But for the Athenians who won the argument
it was obvious they felt our needs

610
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:44,440
for instance access to the Black Sea.
However our feelings.

611
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:49,710
Friendship for the Greeks of Asia Minor
and our fear fear of what the Persians

612
00:49:49,931 --> 00:49:53,620
might do if they got rolling.
All point to the same outcome.

613
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:59,310
And so I think both sides were equally
glad to undertake this new path.

614
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:05,490
I think we will be deeply mistaken if
we imagine that anybody imposed his will

615
00:50:06,941 --> 00:50:08,730
on anybody else in this matter

616
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,200
and in fact the Athenians according
to Plutarch story needed persuasion.

617
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:22,470
Plutarch tells the tale of Aristophanes
who was in command of the Athenian fleet

618
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:27,500
there off Asia Minor at the time when
the same eons particularly took the lead

619
00:50:28,201 --> 00:50:32,640
and came to the Athenians
into Aristophanes and said
Won't you please be our

620
00:50:32,641 --> 00:50:33,474
leaders.

621
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:39,200
Aristotle said before we do that you show
us that you are really committed to us

622
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:45,750
and that you will not simply use us.

623
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,270
I mean I'm putting in stuff
that's not a complete task.

624
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:54,290
Now don't use us as a kind of a way of
convincing the Spartans to stay and then

625
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:55,440
leave us in the lurch.

626
00:50:56,070 --> 00:51:01,070
So you ladies the commander of the samy
and Navy turned took his ship sailed it

627
00:51:02,971 --> 00:51:04,990
against the flagship of poor seniors.

628
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:10,040
This is at the time and past seniors
is still around and rams that ship.

629
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,740
Well that ought to take care of any
possibility of playing footsie with the

630
00:51:13,741 --> 00:51:14,574
Spartans.

631
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:19,820
At which point the Athenians accept the
leadership and then move forward with

632
00:51:22,601 --> 00:51:26,970
the plan for doing so in
the winter of 478 seven.

633
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:32,760
There was a meeting of the Greeks who are
interested at the island of deep loss.

634
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:38,340
The losses right smack in the middle of
the Aegean Sea and as I've told you it

635
00:51:38,451 --> 00:51:39,290
is the

636
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:46,300
birthplace of Apollo and Artemus and
Apollo of course is got a special fondness

637
00:51:47,811 --> 00:51:48,644
for the irony.

638
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:53,840
And so it's the natural place for this
to happen and they come up with what

639
00:51:53,841 --> 00:51:56,570
amount is essentially a
constitutional convention.

640
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:01,970
They come up with a constitution that
will describe how the league is to work.

641
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,270
The aims of the league are.

642
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,400
That the members of the league will fight
against the Persians first of all to

643
00:52:11,651 --> 00:52:16,651
avenge what the Persians did to the
Greeks and secondly to collect booty from

644
00:52:18,611 --> 00:52:23,140
the Persians to pay for the
damage that the Persians did.

645
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:27,980
So that is a part of the
story I think of course.

646
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:30,950
Implicit.

647
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:35,950
It didn't have to be said that the
primary motive must be to maintain or

648
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:41,780
establish I would guess and maintain
the freedom of the Greeks from Persian

649
00:52:42,901 --> 00:52:43,734
rule.

650
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:47,880
The city doesn't mention that and some
scholars have been misled into thinking

651
00:52:47,881 --> 00:52:49,560
that somehow that wasn't
part of the story.

652
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,650
Well how could they do the rest
of it if they didn't do that.

653
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:58,230
These states were obviously in danger
of being taken by the Persians so their

654
00:52:58,231 --> 00:53:02,370
freedom had to be the maintenance of their
freedom had to be step number one and

655
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,950
surely that was clear in their minds.

656
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:11,850
They agreed as it was typical in the
Greek alliances to have the same friends

657
00:53:12,641 --> 00:53:17,320
and enemies common foreign
policy and to carry this forward.

658
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:22,620
They all swore oaths that's their form
of signing treaties they don't sign

659
00:53:23,511 --> 00:53:28,430
treaties they swear oaths
then they dropped.

660
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:34,210
Iron chunks of iron into the sea as
a symbol that this treaty was to be

661
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:37,873
perpetual.

662
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:43,460
That is to say it would last until the
iron came up and floated on the surface.

663
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,240
They knew that wasn't going to happen.

664
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:50,290
So they are us a standard kind of an
alliance with a perpetual I need to make

665
00:53:53,841 --> 00:53:58,841
the point that most Greek alliances that
we hear of in this period are not the

666
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:02,063
the

667
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:09,980
unions and the Spartans in four forty
five make a thirty years piece in four

668
00:54:09,981 --> 00:54:14,981
twenty one they make fifty years peace
on another occasion they make a five year

669
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,530
peace that's that's the way they do
things normally this is different.

670
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,020
This is like.
The Greek Lee.

671
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:24,650
This is a perpetual alliance.

672
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:29,310
The membership of the league
as best we can figure it out.

673
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:31,910
This is not 100 percent
accurate but it's not bad.

674
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:38,510
It includes a first of all informally
at this point it divides the league up

675
00:54:38,931 --> 00:54:43,931
into zones one is the islands of the GNC
and we have knowledge of 20 towns that

676
00:54:47,901 --> 00:54:52,901
are members from the islands Ionia that
is on the coast of Asia Minor itself 36

677
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:00,880
towns along the Hellas Pantene route into
the Black Sea 35 carrier which is the

678
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:07,341
southern coast of Asia Minor has 24 3s
which is the northern shore of the Aegean

679
00:55:10,071 --> 00:55:15,071
Sea in Greek territory is thirty is thirty
three comes to a total of one hundred

680
00:55:15,781 --> 00:55:16,614
and forty eight.

681
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:21,840
You imagine you're talking about one
hundred and fifty towns you've got the

682
00:55:21,841 --> 00:55:26,220
general idea right.
So that's quite an amazing thing.

683
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:29,790
Peloponnesian league certainly didn't
have anything like that in terms of

684
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,624
numbers of states.

685
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:35,400
But don't be too carried away because
lots of these places are just tiny little

686
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:38,760
spots especially when you're
talking about islands.

687
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:44,160
Some of the islands states in the Aegean
and they apparently were just about all

688
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:47,150
members are very small indeed.

689
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:52,110
Still it includes some very important
states like those big islands I mentioned

690
00:55:52,111 --> 00:55:57,111
already Samos chaos and Lesbos and others
that were not quite as big and some

691
00:55:57,721 --> 00:56:02,721
states on the Asian side that were
old and big and important cities.

692
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:08,670
My leaders being one example of it.
So

693
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:11,003
there it is.

694
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:16,240
Notice what I have not
including no Taliban nations.

695
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,000
This is not in any shape manner or form
connected with the Peloponnesian Lee and

696
00:56:24,321 --> 00:56:27,320
I like. I think I'm going to play
my analogy game in a moment too.

697
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:31,640
But what I want to say is you need to be
easiest I think for you to grasp what's

698
00:56:31,641 --> 00:56:32,060
going on.

699
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:37,060
If you think of three
separate organizations first
there's the Greek league

700
00:56:37,401 --> 00:56:41,750
against Persia that was formed in for
eighty one which includes Peloponnesian

701
00:56:41,751 --> 00:56:43,490
states and non Peloponnesian states.

702
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:46,960
Then keep in mind the oldest of these.

703
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,810
I should have mentioned first
the Peloponnesian League
which is older than the

704
00:56:49,811 --> 00:56:51,770
Greek League which includes four.

705
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:55,420
For our purposes essentially
only Peloponnesian states.

706
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:59,740
There are a couple of exceptions but
none are are across the sea in any way.

707
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:05,140
And then there's this newly which
we should call the Dalian league.

708
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:10,170
Although the Greeks referred to it as
the Greeks just as they had the earlier

709
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:12,420
lead.

710
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:15,900
But this that it's easier to think of
it as the deal in league to separate it

711
00:57:15,901 --> 00:57:18,000
from that league.

712
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:23,280
OK here's the analogy that I suggest
that the Greek league against Persia we

713
00:57:24,391 --> 00:57:29,250
might think of as being like the United
Nations organization because it includes

714
00:57:29,251 --> 00:57:33,000
states from both sides
from all of these places.

715
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:39,780
And I think if we think
of the Peloponnesian Lee
as one of the subordinate

716
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:45,610
leagues and the dealing
league as the other.

717
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:50,170
In other words like NATO on the one
hand and the Warsaw Pact on the other.

718
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:55,680
That will be a helpful analogy because
first of all both of them are members of

719
00:57:56,441 --> 00:57:57,570
the Greek league too.

720
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:03,790
And but as the United Nations
Organization charter permits regional

721
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:05,350
associations.

722
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:11,010
So NATO and the Warsaw Pact where
regional associations so too without there

723
00:58:11,081 --> 00:58:12,490
being any formality about it.

724
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:17,380
It clearly didn't mean to abolish the
Peloponnesian league and therefore there

725
00:58:17,381 --> 00:58:22,381
was no reason why they shouldn't be a
different regional alliance like that of

726
00:58:22,841 --> 00:58:27,841
the dealing only that I think is the
structure of the international system in

727
00:58:28,811 --> 00:58:33,550
Greece as we move past the Persian Wars

728
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:37,980
now let's say a little bit
more about that deal league.

729
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:39,780
There are more things you
need to know about it.

730
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,270
It is a germinal league.

731
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:49,070
Just like the Peloponnesian league
that is there is a designated leader.

732
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:55,160
Athens is the designated
regiment of the league and

733
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:03,840
there is also something that's something
quite different something new since

734
00:59:03,841 --> 00:59:04,910
this is a naval league.

735
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:11,160
It costs money in a way that a military
league made of hotlines citizens

736
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:14,043
doesn't.

737
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:19,650
So it was clear there had to be some
league money a league Treasury for this

738
00:59:19,781 --> 00:59:20,614
purpose.

739
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:25,680
They declared the collection of something
they called a force Ross P H O R O S

740
00:59:27,161 --> 00:59:30,910
it just simply means in the
most neutral sense contribution.

741
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:37,020
As time passed this contribution was seen
to be something imposed upon unwilling

742
00:59:39,911 --> 00:59:42,430
payers and in English.

743
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:46,030
We we use the word to
describe it as tribute.

744
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:51,760
But let's think now for the moment only
about the beginning of the league and

745
00:59:51,761 --> 00:59:53,590
what was intended at first.

746
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:59,130
So there is this contribution
which becomes the league
Treasury the assessor was

747
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:06,690
an Athenian general Aristotle's
REIT is the just as he was known.

748
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:12,320
He told each state how much it
would be required to contribute.

749
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:13,960
This took the form in the beginning.

750
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:19,770
In some cases of ships and crews to
Rosen and in other states from the very

751
01:00:20,501 --> 01:00:21,910
beginning.
Money.

752
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:26,110
Now I think we should imagine that the
earlier you are in the league the more

753
01:00:26,111 --> 01:00:29,830
there are.
Allied ships and crews.

754
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:35,350
And as you get later and later until
finally you're into the Peloponnesian War

755
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:41,010
just about every state doesn't have a
fleet of its own doesn't supply cruise but

756
01:00:41,651 --> 01:00:42,970
just pays money.

757
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:47,140
Again I urge you to think about the
beginning and not worry about the end just

758
01:00:47,141 --> 01:00:47,940
now.

759
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:52,940
So the Athenian assesses that there is
also an Athenian citizen who will be

760
01:00:54,431 --> 01:00:59,431
chosen for the job of treasurer of this
new league Hellenic Tommy us as the

761
01:01:01,511 --> 01:01:01,880
Greek.

762
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:06,880
The Greek word and he will see to the
collection and the security of that money

763
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:09,970
and Athenian does that also.

764
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:15,570
Any military or naval campaigns conduct
conducted on behalf of the Dalian league

765
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:19,780
will have an Athenian general in charge.

766
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:24,250
Now you know looking at it backwards
you can say well this is Athenian

767
01:01:24,251 --> 01:01:27,570
imperialism and the Athenians
are imposing their power on no.

768
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:33,540
The Allies would have been the first to
want to do this because what they were

769
01:01:33,551 --> 01:01:34,384
afraid of.

770
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:39,550
Just because the Europeans were afraid
in the 40s was not that the ally that the

771
01:01:39,551 --> 01:01:41,380
Athenians would lorded over them.

772
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:45,970
They were afraid that the Athenians would
run away and leave them to their fate.

773
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:51,420
They wanted to tie the Athenians
into this new organization.

774
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:57,960
Now this deal in league is unsurpassed
among the few international organizations

775
01:01:58,691 --> 01:01:59,650
there are in the Greek world.

776
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:05,220
It was enormously efficient because
you had a leader who was designated and

777
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:09,250
interested and deeply involved.
You had.

778
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:13,250
An organ for making decisions.

779
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:18,000
I haven't mentioned it but there was
what they called the synod of the league

780
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:20,920
gets the Council of the league in which
there are representatives from every

781
01:02:20,921 --> 01:02:25,921
state and it can make all the decisions
that have to be made in that one place.

782
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:32,610
Unlike these other places it has its
own money and its own forces which are

783
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:37,240
assigned to it by the Constitution.

784
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:43,500
All of these things make that a much more
effectively able to do what it has to

785
01:02:43,661 --> 01:02:44,494
do

786
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:50,980
without any great difficulty in the
decision making process and to make that a

787
01:02:50,981 --> 01:02:52,630
little clearer I need to
tell you another thing.

788
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:59,720
In the Synod the arrangement was one
state one vote so Athens was a one member

789
01:03:03,151 --> 01:03:08,010
of that Synod Athens which had
the lion's share of the power.

790
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:13,350
Had only one vote.
So how could the Athenians have their way.

791
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:18,480
You may ask but the way it really worked
was because Athens had all of this

792
01:03:18,481 --> 01:03:23,481
prestige and all of this power it meant
all of the very small powerless states

793
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:31,190
huddled under the wings of the Athenians
and could be counted on to deliver the

794
01:03:33,061 --> 01:03:35,850
right sort of vote to do
what the Athenians told him.

795
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:41,420
Whereas supposing they had used something
like proportional representation given

796
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:47,480
the Athenians X number of votes a lot
of votes but they would have had to give

797
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:53,100
safe source and I don't mean face to
face all still but Samos chaos Lesbos all

798
01:03:53,791 --> 01:03:58,791
these big towns and islands numerous votes
as well and they would certainly have

799
01:04:00,451 --> 01:04:03,150
been more votes than the Athenians had.

800
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:08,900
They could have voted then the Athenians
if they got together under this one man

801
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:12,210
one one state one vote rule.
That's impossible.

802
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:17,720
We never never hear of any trouble
passing whatever the Athenians want in the

803
01:04:20,811 --> 01:04:21,644
assembly.

804
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:26,710
There's just no check on their doing
what they want in a constitutional way

805
01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:31,243
now.

806
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:36,140
So long as everybody's playing by the
original rules this doesn't really present

807
01:04:36,141 --> 01:04:40,550
any serious problem. But as time passes
and there are differences of opinion.

808
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:43,670
And as for various reasons I will explain.

809
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:49,240
The Athenians begin to assert their
power and begin to change the situation.

810
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:56,140
It's at that point that the question of
autonomy will arise and the Athenians

811
01:04:56,601 --> 01:05:01,601
will in fact interfere with the autonomy
of the other states and turn the league

812
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:07,960
ultimately into what the Greeks called
an ah Hey which we rightly translate as

813
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:10,243
an empire.

814
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:15,200
But once again I don't want you to think
about that when you're thinking about

815
01:05:15,201 --> 01:05:19,700
the situation in 477 that's in the
future and that's not what people are

816
01:05:19,701 --> 01:05:21,710
expecting or wanting.

817
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:28,880
There is a common interest and it's very
strong and 477 to deal with the threat

818
01:05:30,001 --> 01:05:30,834
of the Persia.

819
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:36,050
And to get revenge and payment from
the Persians for what has happened the

820
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:41,391
problem only emerges or problems emerge
when the challenge from Persia recedes

821
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:50,720
and as we shall see that's of course
was the same problem that NATO suffered

822
01:05:51,061 --> 01:05:55,620
from and suffers from today which is
to the degree that they don't feel

823
01:05:55,621 --> 01:05:58,950
threatened by anything the states that
are allied to the United States don't

824
01:05:58,951 --> 01:06:00,660
feel they have to do
what the Americans want.

825
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,520
And that's the way it was when
the situation developed in Greece.

826
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:12,090
OK so that's the original
situation of the dealing only.

827
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:17,900
And I want to turn next to the story of
how that turns into the Athenian Empire.

828
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:25,350
And the first thing I want to indicate
to you is that the success of the deal

829
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:28,510
only from the outset was extraordinary.

830
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:34,460
Well one little town that was still in
Persian hands in 477 was the town of E.ON

831
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:41,150
located at the mouth of the stream on
river up in Thrace the Athenian commander

832
01:06:42,471 --> 01:06:47,471
took of league fleet to E.ON and drove
the Persians out soon thereafter.

833
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:53,600
By the way the dates that we
have for this are very insecure.

834
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:59,170
They are mostly derived from the story
that two cities tells us it's a very the

835
01:07:00,711 --> 01:07:05,030
details are very few and he doesn't
give us very many good dates if any.

836
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:08,120
So there's a certain amount of estimation.

837
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:11,420
It doesn't really matter from your point
of view but I don't want I will give

838
01:07:11,421 --> 01:07:15,980
you dates that are those that are commonly
accepted but you mustn't imagine that

839
01:07:15,981 --> 01:07:17,540
they're firmly fixed.

840
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:23,420
Anyway some years not too many after the
establishment of the league the league

841
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:28,580
under the great Athenian commander who
will play a larger and larger role in

842
01:07:28,581 --> 01:07:33,581
league affairs and then and also in
Athenian political affairs came on takes

843
01:07:34,311 --> 01:07:38,270
this force against the island
of scare us in the Aegean.

844
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:43,550
Scare us was attacked because
it was not inhabited by Greeks.

845
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:48,740
It was inhabited by non Greek peoples
who made their living out of piracy.

846
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:54,670
Well clearly all the states of the
league had a lot to lose from allowing

847
01:07:54,831 --> 01:07:59,831
pirates to roam freely in their
waters and so came on crushed.

848
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:06,340
The Syrians pirates and to make sure he
drove them from the island and he made

849
01:08:08,031 --> 01:08:13,031
sure that the island would be secure
by putting an Athenian cleric.

850
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:17,300
Remember that cleric.
The Athenians put in a near Karl kiss.

851
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:22,720
This is the same kind of arrangement
Athenians of military age who permanently

852
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:29,240
settle in scare us but retain
their Athenian citizenship.

853
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:34,690
They are a garrison in effect to protect
the island of scare us from falling

854
01:08:35,181 --> 01:08:37,130
into bad hands.

855
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:42,370
In the future it was widely believed and
justifiably that came on in that force

856
01:08:45,071 --> 01:08:49,860
had liberated the Aegean Sea.
We never hear about piracy anymore.

857
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:55,230
Piracy was a problem that the states in
the Mediterranean in general suffered

858
01:08:55,361 --> 01:08:59,230
from a lot and at different
times very very seriously.

859
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:04,060
One thing that this new league even and
when it's the daily league one becomes

860
01:09:04,061 --> 01:09:04,894
18 an empire.

861
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:09,650
There is no piracy in the
region where that lead exists.

862
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:14,230
Then they turn to the city of Christos
which is at the southern end of the

863
01:09:14,231 --> 01:09:19,231
island WBA ends you remember had under
the greatest military pressure actually

864
01:09:23,141 --> 01:09:28,141
surrendered to the Persians given earth
and water and so technically they were

865
01:09:29,621 --> 01:09:33,160
mi visors and there was
no mercy shown to them.

866
01:09:33,790 --> 01:09:38,290
They were compelled they didn't wish to
do this but they were compelled to join

867
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:43,680
the deal only and to pay
a cash contribution not to
be allowed to provide their

868
01:09:46,271 --> 01:09:47,104
own ships.

869
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:53,460
Thus almost from the very beginning
there is one instance of a state which

870
01:09:54,701 --> 01:09:59,080
doesn't fit the general picture I've
been painting a state that is a subject

871
01:09:59,081 --> 01:10:04,081
state and is compelled to be a member
but it's just this one case of a meat

872
01:10:04,481 --> 01:10:05,314
izing state.

873
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:09,790
Then possibly in the year 470

874
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:16,110
another development we hear that the
island of Naxos seems to be an island full

875
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:16,590
of trouble.

876
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:19,590
Every time we hear of next us getting
into difficulties or some kind or another

877
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:24,180
but they decided that there wasn't
any great threat from Persia that the

878
01:10:24,181 --> 01:10:25,560
Persians weren't coming back.

879
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:30,770
And so they said we're quitting the league
well I'm sure somebody said don't you

880
01:10:31,521 --> 01:10:34,520
remember you swore this oath you
threw some higher lumps into the sea.

881
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:39,060
Do you see any iron floating around here
in the Aegean Sea. You're not quitting.

882
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:44,620
They rebelled the league sent the fleet.

883
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:50,340
They put down the next rebellion and
Nexus was now reduced from the category of

884
01:10:51,641 --> 01:10:53,010
a free ally.

885
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:58,330
Making the kinds of contributions the
other allied state did to another subject

886
01:10:58,331 --> 01:11:02,300
state which paid money didn't.

887
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,150
The walls were taken down
their fleet was taken away.

888
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:10,120
And that's the pattern that we shall
see states who don't carry out their

889
01:11:10,121 --> 01:11:12,280
responsibilities states that

890
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:19,080
particularly try to rebuild will be
treated this way and their number will

891
01:11:19,511 --> 01:11:20,860
increase as time passes.

892
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:26,190
Now so far by the way we do not hear of
anybody in the league objecting to these

893
01:11:26,381 --> 01:11:31,381
decisions and these actions nor should
we expect that there would be the allies

894
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:36,990
still believed they needed this league
and they weren't about to let people get

895
01:11:37,511 --> 01:11:41,630
a free ride such as Christmas
would whether they paid or not.

896
01:11:41,650 --> 01:11:46,000
The Persians weren't going to attack
them so they ought to pay for states like

897
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:49,270
Naxos who decided well we
feel safe enough so we quit.

898
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:50,830
That wasn't gonna be permitted.

899
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,630
Well in a sense what you can really see
from this is that the league was working

900
01:11:56,110 --> 01:12:01,110
as it was supposed to to be able to do
the job that it had to and then if the

901
01:12:02,891 --> 01:12:07,870
dates are right in the next year 469 comes
a very important turning point in the

902
01:12:07,871 --> 01:12:08,704
history of the league.

903
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:14,290
The Persians have a fleet
in the well I guess.

904
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:19,470
You can't really call it the Aegean it's
around the corner on the southern coast

905
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,070
of Asia Minor.

906
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:26,870
You remote on river flows out there and
they had a fleet and an army inland.

907
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:32,880
The league forces went there to that
year Ramadan under the command of came on

908
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:39,560
defeated and crushed the Persian fleet
at sea landed and defeated the Persian

909
01:12:41,731 --> 01:12:42,990
army on the land.

910
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:48,530
And that was a terrible blow to
the Persian position in the eastern

911
01:12:49,381 --> 01:12:50,214
Mediterranean.

912
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:54,780
The evidence is apparently that
the Persians had a pull back.

913
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:59,550
From that entire area and
it would not have been

914
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:06,500
at all unreasonable for people to think
well the Persian threat really is over.

915
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:10,950
This is beyond what happened in 479.

916
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:13,650
It's not just that we've
driven them out of Europe.

917
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:17,310
We've driven them away
from the Mediterranean Sea.

918
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:23,030
You could imagine that that's just the
end of the Persian threat that was not

919
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:30,890
the view taken by the Athenians
or I guess by most of the allies.

920
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:37,610
But we can imagine that there were some
of the allies who were restless in their

921
01:13:39,391 --> 01:13:43,530
need to continue to make contributions
to the league when they didn't feel that

922
01:13:43,531 --> 01:13:48,090
there was any purpose for
the league anymore here.

923
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:50,220
I gave a hint to this earlier.

924
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:54,210
I don't remember what the
general GRUNTS There was.

925
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:57,660
The second commander of NATO.
But he was anyway.

926
01:13:57,690 --> 01:14:02,650
He was an earlier commander of NATO.
He's obviously a West Point man educated.

927
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:05,400
He knew all about facilities
in the Peloponnesian War.

928
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:10,880
And so he made the analogy between the
first time I'm aware that anybody did

929
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:16,280
between NATO and the Dalian league and
he was doing so as commander of NATO at a

930
01:14:17,941 --> 01:14:22,941
period when he felt that the American
allies in Europe were more and more

931
01:14:23,341 --> 01:14:27,140
reluctant to make the kinds
of contributions that he
thought they should make

932
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:32,040
and was being wailing his situation
which was every time the Russians looked

933
01:14:32,041 --> 01:14:35,460
like they were going to behave then the
allies decided they didn't want to make

934
01:14:35,461 --> 01:14:36,450
any contributions.

935
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:40,040
And then when the Russians look scary
everybody came running and said sure sure

936
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:45,020
we'll continue. And he suggested that's
the way it was in the deal and league to.

937
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:52,940
So keeping the back of your mind that
there are real questions out there in the

938
01:14:53,761 --> 01:14:58,761
league as to whether it should persist
and we'll carry this story forward next

939
01:14:59,201 --> 01:14:59,360
time.
