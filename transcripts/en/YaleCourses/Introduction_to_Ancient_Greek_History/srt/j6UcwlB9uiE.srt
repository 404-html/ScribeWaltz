1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,940
I think the last thing I mentioned to
you was the attempted coup data on the

2
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:10,941
part of a nobleman by the name of
Kahlon who was attempting to establish a

3
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:14,700
tyranny of the sort that were becoming.

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:20,490
That was becoming common in
the neighborhood and that
he was the son in law of a

5
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:22,764
tyrant.

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,990
Next door mega it the coup failed.

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,010
But the problems that we imagine
produced the coup did not go away.

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,340
And one sees evidence of continuing
pressure for change away from the

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,880
traditional aristocratic Republic which
the early polls was towards something

10
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,230
that would challenge the unquestioned
traditional rule of the aristocracy in.

11
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,880
Again these are all traditional dates
and shouldn't be taken too seriously as

12
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:04,881
precise but probably reflect a pretty
decent chronology in a general way so that

13
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:11,901
in the traditional year of six twenty one
we hear that Athens received its first

14
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,770
written law code famous as the code of
Draco or in Greek it would be Dirac Kahn

15
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:29,430
and the reports that we have of it
indicate that one kind of law that was

16
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:37,241
included in the code was concerning
homicide which has a special place in the

17
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:44,380
Greek thinking probably it's true of
most primitive societies that homicide

18
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:48,780
involves religious ideas.

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,920
The Greeks believed that killing of men
was accepted more time was a religious

20
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:03,290
pollution that had to be taken
care of one way or another.

21
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:08,570
Beyond that there was also the primitive
thing that was not particularly

22
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:13,571
religious but reflected primitive thinking
of all homicides need to be avenged.

23
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,930
And so the blood feud was clearly part
of the way to deal with homicide and

24
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,860
early Greek history.

25
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,200
And as is true of most early societies
there comes a time when that no longer

26
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:33,511
will do that there is a
sufficient civilization
urbanization whatever it is that

27
00:02:34,691 --> 00:02:38,770
made the change that people
feel this has got to stop.

28
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,060
One reason it does is of course
it tears a community apart.

29
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,900
And as you are in the business of building
a community which is what's happening

30
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:50,260
here in the polls you
can't have that going on.

31
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,170
One reason it is the way to settle
things is because there isn't any proper

32
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,560
government.
There are only these noblemen.

33
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,590
There is a council to be sure but it's
all a question of going to somebody who

34
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:09,901
has power and has respect and
getting a judgment from them.

35
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,640
But as time passes that's not good enough.

36
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,400
And as the community becomes something
that is more I'm more unified.

37
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,520
There is a search for a better outcome.

38
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:26,570
And that is what resulted in the code of
Draco which just the fact that there is

39
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,260
a written code so that it is now available
to anybody who can read which is not

40
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:39,751
to say lots of people but even so people
who can read can now tell it to other

41
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:40,624
people.

42
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,790
That very fact is the sign of the
decline of the power of the aristocracy

43
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,230
because they alone used to know what
the law was or a claim to know it and

44
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,600
people would go to them
and say what's the law.

45
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,190
And they could administer it as they saw
fit which gave them extraordinary power

46
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,720
not to say prestige.

47
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:04,170
Now when it is possible at least in some
realms of the law to know what that law

48
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,740
is that has reduced the special place
that the Aristocrats have in society

49
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:19,350
stories are told about the code of Draco
Like most early law codes and we can't

50
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:24,901
compare the draconian code with famous
or less famous ones much older that we

51
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:31,120
find especially in Mesopotamia
and the Ancient Near East.

52
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,480
The most famous of these because it has
been inscribed on a remarkable piece of

53
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:42,991
sculpture which is now in the Louvre
in Paris the Code of Hammurabi from the

54
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:48,010
second millennium B.C. is really
quite similar in its essence.

55
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,090
It says if so and so does such a thing.

56
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,390
This is what the punishment is.

57
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,600
And from our point of view

58
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,610
early codes like Draco are
notorious for how harsh they are.

59
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,820
The Greeks later on said that the code
of Draco was written not in ink but in

60
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:14,314
blood.

61
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:22,170
And but in fact what it does is to codify
what had been the ordinary practice.

62
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,420
Nobody was inventing laws.

63
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,280
They were writing down what had
been the customary procedures.

64
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,870
And again a characteristic of such
developments is that over time when people

65
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,510
know how harsh these things are.

66
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:42,530
And as society sort of calms down from
the more wild condition that it was in an

67
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:47,911
earlier time it tends to
reduce the severity of the
penalties and to legislate.

68
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,090
However the legislation goes
forward in a more gentle way.

69
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,650
So that's another development which is
obviously the consequence of aristocrats

70
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:05,890
don't give up their power willingly
out of the goodness of their hearts.

71
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,780
This pressure out there.

72
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:14,190
Scuse me for access to the legal process
for the ordinary person and again I

73
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:22,831
think it's easy to believe that a lot
of that pressure is coming from that hop

74
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:28,120
like farmer class that is becoming more
important and more demanding all the

75
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:33,121
time another change in the old placid
life of the early Athenian Republic as we

76
00:06:36,371 --> 00:06:41,371
imagined it to be is the conquest by
the Athenians of the island of Solomons

77
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,950
that lies in this ironic Gulf to the
west of Attica between Attica and Negara

78
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:54,090
Athens and mega row will contest the
control of Solomon's for some time and

79
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:57,280
fight each other over it.

80
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,890
And on this occasion sometime here in
the seventh century probably towards the

81
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:07,891
end of the Seventh Century Athens
conquers Solomon's and populated with the

82
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,703
Athenians.

83
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:15,780
It's it's it's it's not really a a colony
in the sense that these outpost Kii I

84
00:07:15,911 --> 00:07:17,470
described for you are.

85
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,140
It simply becomes part of Attica as
do all the subdivisions in Attica.

86
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,560
But it's the first occasion that we
see of the physical expansion of the

87
00:07:29,351 --> 00:07:33,910
Athenian polis which is indicative of the
kind of stuff we've been talking about

88
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,960
elsewhere as well.

89
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:40,380
And yet another sign takes place about
the same time end of the 7th very early

90
00:07:40,871 --> 00:07:45,871
in the 6th century the establishment
of the first overseas colony by the

91
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:51,961
Athenians at a place called the CGM
across the GNC just at the entrance to the

92
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:55,550
Dardanelles to the hellish pond.

93
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,500
And that is not an accident
I think because that route
through the hellish spot

94
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,740
through the Sea of Marmara through the
Bosphorus and into the Black Sea will as

95
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:13,050
Athens develops economically become the
most critical trade route for Athens

96
00:08:15,641 --> 00:08:16,474
indeed.

97
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:21,510
After a while when Athens has developed
a mixed economy and become and its

98
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,970
population grows it becomes dependent
on that route for supplying it with the

99
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:32,770
grain that it needs as the
staple of life for its people.

100
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,800
So this is a first little step towards
a very important development for Athens

101
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:44,490
in the future.
And I guess the reasons for it late.

102
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,350
And less pressing than in the other
places. But they must be the same.

103
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,330
To some considerable degree hunger for
land which means that there is a growing

104
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:58,331
population that needs additional land
and also because of the location of it.

105
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,000
It's inescapable I think that they are
also thinking that early of commercial

106
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:05,930
considerations.

107
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:11,350
And it turns out that there were very
great commercial opportunities in that

108
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,123
direction.

109
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:18,580
So we've seen a number of signs of change
moving Athens in the direction that

110
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:23,300
the other Greek states were moving.

111
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,970
Which brings us in the early
6th century to the first.

112
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:32,300
I think it's I think I've said this
before but I want to say it again to the

113
00:09:32,301 --> 00:09:37,301
first truly living human being that we
come across probably in all of Greek

114
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:42,050
history certainly in that of Athens.

115
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,320
So on whom we think of as the great
law giver for reasons that you've read

116
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,730
about. And I'll tell you
about in a moment anyway.

117
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,240
The reason he is so much we can speak
of him as a human being because he wrote

118
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,830
those poems from which I read you
some expert excerpts the other day.

119
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,530
And that poem tells us something about
him and about the world in which he lived

120
00:10:06,531 --> 00:10:11,531
and will and of course we have many many
stories about him because he was very

121
00:10:11,931 --> 00:10:16,931
well remembered as a critical individual
in the history not only of Athens but

122
00:10:17,511 --> 00:10:18,344
in Greece.

123
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:23,650
The Greeks later put together a list of
the Seven Sages seven wise men of the

124
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,550
archaic period in Greek history and
so long is one of the Seven Sages.

125
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,490
Indeed one of the problems about knowing
the truth about what solong did is that

126
00:10:36,981 --> 00:10:41,930
it's pretty clear that lots of stories
that had nothing to do with so long were

127
00:10:41,931 --> 00:10:46,931
attached to so on in later ages because
he was the prominent figure that

128
00:10:47,061 --> 00:10:49,100
everybody had heard about
and knew something about.

129
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:54,610
And so it isn't easy to know if somebody
says so long did this or so long said

130
00:10:55,311 --> 00:10:57,230
that whether he really did.

131
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:02,090
We can only try to sort of
figure it out as best we can.

132
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,790
But that's a special
problem we have about him.

133
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:07,820
Now what comes

134
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:14,630
becomes apparent as soon as we examine
the things that brought so long to the

135
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:19,631
fore is that Athens is clearly suffering
a very serious internal problem as we

136
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:28,661
get to these years by the
way the traditional date
for so long's appointment as

137
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:35,710
sole Arkan in these years
is five ninety four B.C..

138
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:41,030
Again we don't have to take that literally
but it tells you we're really talking

139
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:43,780
about the very beginning
of the sixth century.

140
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,860
Here's the picture as it is depicted by
so long himself in his poems but also in

141
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,880
the work of Herodotus
and other later writers

142
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,690
the crisis in its most acute form takes
the shape of Athenians who have been

143
00:12:04,761 --> 00:12:06,020
enslaved.

144
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,520
Some of them have not only been enslaved
and live in Attica as slaves but some

145
00:12:13,281 --> 00:12:17,960
of them have been sold abroad and stolen
tells us that some of them have been

146
00:12:17,961 --> 00:12:22,961
abroad so long they have forgotten the
Athenian language so that we have to have

147
00:12:25,641 --> 00:12:30,200
a picture in which this this
problem is one of some duration.

148
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:35,150
We have to imagine it's at least
a couple of generations old.

149
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,100
In order for that to make any sense.

150
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:42,130
But it reaches its peak around the time
I'm talking about and it's this that how

151
00:12:44,451 --> 00:12:45,770
did they get to be slaves.

152
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,520
This is not a case where
people had always been slaves.

153
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:54,110
These are not people who were brought
from somewhere else as slaves.

154
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,750
These are not people who were conquered
and made slaves by the conquerors.

155
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:04,150
These are Athenian citizens who used to
be free and have become slaves and the

156
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:09,050
answer to how they became
slaves is through debt.

157
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,660
People were borrowing money and
obviously failing to pay it back.

158
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:20,270
And at a certain point they
couldn't borrow money on
the basis of something they

159
00:13:20,271 --> 00:13:23,480
could offer as a surety for the loan.

160
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:28,640
If they had land that would have been
gone by now if they had movable products

161
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:33,641
or movable possessions that would have
been gone all they had left to give was

162
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,990
the person and probably I hate to tell
you this my friends but the reality is

163
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:39,824
reality.

164
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,810
Probably the first thing they did was to
give their children as a surety for the

165
00:13:44,811 --> 00:13:49,811
loan and when the loan was not met the
children became slaves of the person who

166
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:55,061
had lent them money and very at some
point probably this even happened to grown

167
00:13:55,611 --> 00:14:00,611
ups themselves so that a sufficient number
of people had been so enslaved as to

168
00:14:01,611 --> 00:14:04,390
create a very general problem.

169
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,320
The story is that apart from direct
slavery there was another form of

170
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,350
farming by very poor people
that was led to terrific misery.

171
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:24,300
The term that the Greeks used for this
was the heck tame or Roy which means one

172
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,360
sixth men and scholars have argued
about what does this mean that the.

173
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:37,170
These were people who who had been so
far into debt that they were essentially

174
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:41,740
sharecroppers. And the question
is did they keep one sixth of it.

175
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,660
Did they keep five sixth.

176
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,520
I think anybody who knows anything about
what's possible on a farm like this

177
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:52,480
realizes it couldn't have been more than
one sixth that they gave away because

178
00:14:52,481 --> 00:14:53,314
they didn't make enough.

179
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,210
They wouldn't been able to stay alive
but in any case these one sixth men were

180
00:14:58,211 --> 00:15:03,211
fundamentally sharecroppers under the
control of the people to whom they owe the

181
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:04,354
debt.

182
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:09,630
And another aspect of this thing was
that the lands that were mortgaged in

183
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:18,121
effect were the mortgage was shown by a
stone that had the mortgage inscribed on

184
00:15:20,681 --> 00:15:22,720
it and placed on the soil.

185
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:27,750
They were called poor Roy and so the
seeing the hall rise spares scattered all

186
00:15:29,021 --> 00:15:34,021
over the fields were indicative of the
pitiful lot of the poor farmers who had

187
00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:39,130
fallen into debt
during this period.

188
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:44,220
Well scholars also had a fantastic time
trying to figure out how this came about

189
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:50,320
and I never found anything that seemed
satisfactory to me based on looking at

190
00:15:50,321 --> 00:15:53,330
the sources or reading people's
interpretations until once again.

191
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:58,770
My hero Victor Hanson came on down
the road and he's a man of honor.

192
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,180
It's just amazing how much that helps
him understand farmers and I like his

193
00:16:04,181 --> 00:16:06,080
interpretation of how things got that way.

194
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,820
So let me give you a quick
rundown of how that work.

195
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:14,730
Remember these these times are the
times and fundamentally of a growth of

196
00:16:15,731 --> 00:16:20,731
farming skill growth farming return people
making living on areas farm farmland

197
00:16:21,671 --> 00:16:24,550
that they could never have made a living
on before because they've learned how

198
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:29,551
to grow the olive and grow the vine and
make olive oil and make wine and have

199
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:35,491
reclaimed land from which had not
been useful for farming in the past.

200
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:43,300
And that's how they got into trouble
because for one thing farmers don't all

201
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:45,760
succeed in any society.

202
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:50,750
There are farmers who try to be good
farmers and fail and they fail sometimes

203
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:54,470
through their own shortcomings and they
fail sometimes because nature is not

204
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:58,760
kind to them. Luck is always
part of the game in farming.

205
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:04,150
But what happens is that they get into
trouble because things don't go well.

206
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,750
They start out they have a crop
and the crop doesn't do well.

207
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:13,550
So they need money for next year both to
make it through the winter and also to

208
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:18,290
have seed for the following year. So what
they do is have to borrow that money.

209
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,980
And if the next crop is bad too.
Well there you go.

210
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,850
And you can see the
whole process unraveling.

211
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,010
I think that's probably
the way it came about.

212
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,760
According to Hansen the majority of
the farmers were not so affected.

213
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,220
They were doing OK.

214
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:42,530
It was the losers who were the ones
who were suffering these things.

215
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:47,630
But there were enough losers so that
this was a very serious problem.

216
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:53,120
Now this rejects other earlier theories
that for instance that the soil of

217
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:58,121
Attica had become exhausted
through over cropping and so on.

218
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,450
If Hansen is right this is less likely
to be true than it used to be because

219
00:18:02,451 --> 00:18:03,560
there's more diversity.

220
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:07,820
Diversification of farming than
there had been in the past.

221
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:14,350
And another another theory is that a
cause of the problem was deforestation.

222
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:20,890
Well it's perfectly true that Athens
was severely deforested in the course of

223
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:27,650
the centuries so that plateau could
comment on how this deforestation had

224
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,470
denuded Athens of trees
by the fourth century.

225
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,730
But there's no reason to think that
that was happening especially during the

226
00:18:34,731 --> 00:18:39,731
time of so long very probably
that deforestation hadn't
gone that far and in any

227
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:44,891
case its connection to problems of the
farmland are less clear than they might

228
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:49,280
be. Here's what Hansen
finally concludes about it.

229
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:54,310
He says the crisis was a
natural evolutionary process
of success and failure a

230
00:18:57,561 --> 00:19:02,561
subtle transformation that occurs when
there are fundamental changes in land use

231
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:09,580
and a growing population and that
seems to me to be the most satisfactory

232
00:19:09,821 --> 00:19:13,150
account of how the
Athenians got into that fix.

233
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,080
But in that fix they were
there's no question about it.

234
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,810
So the question was what is to be done.

235
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,640
Now the pressure to do something
about it I think is twofold.

236
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,620
Of course inherently Athenians would
have been bothered by all of this.

237
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,770
Even those who were not the
ones who did the suffering.

238
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,760
But it's amazing how we all are able to
bear the suffering of our neighbor if we

239
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:38,890
are not suffering too.

240
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,640
However the second element I think that
put pressure on everybody was next door

241
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,510
and Negara when things
had gone bad for the poor.

242
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,740
There was a revolution and
the tyranny was established.

243
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,230
And so it was down the road in Corinth.

244
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,940
And so it was a little further down
the road and so on so that the dominant

245
00:20:00,941 --> 00:20:05,941
people the satisfied people the people
who like things as they were were worried

246
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:11,490
that if they didn't solve their socio
economic problem they would find

247
00:20:11,861 --> 00:20:16,480
themselves confronting a tyranny because
after all that's what Keelan had in

248
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,250
mind back 30 thirty five years ago.

249
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,060
And the danger was ever present.

250
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,340
And I think that is what you
need to have in your mind.

251
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:30,420
The threat of tyranny was the great
element that made chances or attempts at

252
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:39,001
reform necessary and allowed the Athenians
to give things a try that they would

253
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:41,800
never have thought of before.

254
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:48,180
And so what they finally decided to do
was to select from among themselves.

255
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:57,070
One Athenian who would replace all the
nine icons of the usual government of

256
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:04,861
Athens and be given the job of soul
are Kahn for one year and he would be

257
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:12,631
allowed to legislate for the Athenians
as a way out of the trouble they were in.

258
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,980
Now think of how how
desperate things must be.

259
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,760
And one aspect of that desperation I
think we have to believe is that there was

260
00:21:24,671 --> 00:21:29,671
no way they could have put together a
coalition of citizens who would have been

261
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:35,731
sufficiently unified sufficiently public
spirited to trust with such an activity

262
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,530
that anybody that we have to believe
that there were sufficient differences of

263
00:21:44,531 --> 00:21:49,090
interest on the part of different elements
in the society that would have made

264
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:51,940
that impossible.
Otherwise you don't do this kind of thing.

265
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:57,420
It is worth pointing out that something
like So London's soul our ship is heard

266
00:21:58,181 --> 00:22:00,200
of about the same time in Greek history.

267
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:05,650
In other towns sometimes they appointed
somebody they called an ICM they chase

268
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,450
somebody who is supposed to be the
guy who settle things for them.

269
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:15,510
So it's an idea that came obviously
naturally to the Greeks but we ought to

270
00:22:15,911 --> 00:22:20,140
recognize what an extraordinary thing
it really is. They chose so long.

271
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,390
Why did they choose so long.

272
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:29,010
He obviously was reputed to have the
kinds of characteristics which would make

273
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:34,441
him a competent intelligent wise
fair person to do this kind of thing.

274
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,820
He had achieved fame notoriety
by his military activity.

275
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:45,790
He had led in the war against

276
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,600
McGarry ends and had fought very well.

277
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:55,430
And it was out of that
military achievement that he
became well known and then

278
00:22:55,431 --> 00:22:59,090
his other characteristics
obviously were also well-known.

279
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:03,980
If you read his poems you realize he was
a man who knew how to express himself

280
00:23:03,981 --> 00:23:08,981
and to persuade others of what he had in
mind and that his approach was one that

281
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:15,290
was popular. We should keep
in mind what's going on here.

282
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,160
First of all we are told he was a man.
We have contradictory stories.

283
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,280
And I think I can understand
how the contradiction arose.

284
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:27,820
One story says he was a nobleman
coming from extremely famous important

285
00:23:30,231 --> 00:23:31,130
ancestors.

286
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:36,610
The other speaks of him as a man of the
middle rank which doesn't really work

287
00:23:37,371 --> 00:23:41,660
out. With that I think best explanation
I can come up with that is that he

288
00:23:41,661 --> 00:23:43,880
undoubtedly was a person of noble birth.

289
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:49,540
In that kind of society only such a
person was likely to be looked to for a

290
00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:53,930
position of leadership.
But I think what may have persuaded folks.

291
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,860
Well he also couldn't have been fabulously
wealthy but certainly he was not a

292
00:23:57,861 --> 00:23:58,694
poor man.

293
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:03,740
But what I think convince people that
he was of the middle rank was that his

294
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:09,070
message and the propaganda that he
sent out in his poems and indeed the

295
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:14,861
character of the reforms that he
proposed were very much moderate.

296
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:22,750
That's the word that came to be the one
so much admired and favored and sought

297
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,930
by the Greek people.

298
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:33,100
Keep in mind this is the period in Greek
history when the Delphic Oracle has

299
00:24:34,461 --> 00:24:39,461
come to the height of its influence in
the Greek world and in the surrounding

300
00:24:40,491 --> 00:24:41,510
world as well.

301
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:47,110
And the oracle of Apollo at Delphi was
the most famous place that was putting

302
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,650
forward the idea of moderation.

303
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,120
The Greek word is soft Rawson
a self-control and moderation.

304
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:02,690
And you remember the messages
at the Delphic oracle.

305
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,080
Know thyself meaning don't imagine that
you are more than a man but that you are

306
00:25:08,211 --> 00:25:12,620
merely a man and don't
do anything in excess.

307
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:17,650
Moderation was what should be sought
weeks never stopped worshiping at the

308
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:19,940
shrine of moderation for
the rest of their history.

309
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:25,160
Cynical men say the Greeks were so in
love with moderation because it was so

310
00:25:25,161 --> 00:25:26,420
rare among them.

311
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,260
But I think it's rare among all of us.

312
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,700
So here was someone who was the spokesman
of that very powerful mode of thinking

313
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:44,960
that was pervading the Greek world at
the time and no doubt he gave it a great

314
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:48,680
step forward with the things that
he did and the things that he said.

315
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,460
Okay let's look at a few
of the things that he did.

316
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:57,150
I'm picking out things that I pretty
sure really were so lonely and there were

317
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,770
others that attributed to him that are
more debatable but the most basic problem

318
00:26:01,771 --> 00:26:06,060
is what are we going to do with these
people who are losing their property have

319
00:26:06,061 --> 00:26:08,160
lost their property
have lost their freedom.

320
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:12,060
What's to be done about that agricultural
problem we've been talking about.

321
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,153
And so.

322
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:20,020
So Len introduced the measure which
is called in Greek the cease fire.

323
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:25,620
Fortunately you have it on your computers
and you've all copied it down and

324
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,250
taken it to class so you can study
these things right. Don't answer

325
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:33,643
that.

326
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:38,710
That measure abolished all debts that
were based on the body of the person that

327
00:26:43,251 --> 00:26:47,690
is that that were the surety given
was the body of the borrower.

328
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:52,490
Any debt that was so incurred
was abolished cancelled

329
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:58,190
on the other hand there was no
general cancellation of debts.

330
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:02,660
In other words any normal debt that
didn't have that characteristic continued.

331
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,290
Another thing that the poor and
the unhappy would have liked.

332
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,620
They would have like General
cancellation of debt I should point out.

333
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:16,090
Whenever you have lower class discontent
in the Greek world there are two things

334
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,980
that they typically ask for.

335
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,190
One is abolition of debt
because they're always in debt.

336
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,940
And the second thing is redistribution
of the land now redistribution of the

337
00:27:27,341 --> 00:27:29,410
land means civil war.

338
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:34,120
Nobody is going to allow his land to
be taken away from him and given to

339
00:27:34,121 --> 00:27:36,190
somebody else without a fight.

340
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:41,710
And so if you go for that what you're
going to have to do is to have armed force

341
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:45,580
to achieve it and you're going to end up
with a tyranny because that's the kind

342
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,560
of thing tyrants are more likely to do.

343
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:53,850
So he avoided that and he did not
permit redistribution of the land.

344
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,910
If you just look at that land question
for a moment and the debt bondage

345
00:28:00,911 --> 00:28:05,911
question you can see that it is indeed
the moderate position in between the view

346
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:14,371
of those the poor the enslaved indebted
who wanted these radical changes and the

347
00:28:16,631 --> 00:28:20,320
old aristocracy who would have preferred
to just leave things as they were

348
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:26,160
instead so long came through with this
middling program which and by the way

349
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:29,500
apparently there was we don't know how
well this was done but apparently they

350
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:34,140
brought back Athenians who
had been enslaved abroad also.

351
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,860
So there must have been some expenditure
of funds somehow they must have

352
00:28:38,861 --> 00:28:41,530
collected it from somebody
and brought them back.

353
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:46,230
But the most important thing is
what's done right there in Attica.

354
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:51,750
And of course to what all of this does
is to settle down the situation for the

355
00:28:56,831 --> 00:29:01,831
moment but it does not guarantee that
these very same problems that produced the

356
00:29:03,521 --> 00:29:08,521
difficulty we're talking about would not
reappear in the future and I think as

357
00:29:09,461 --> 00:29:13,090
we look at this measure it's already
a clue to most everything that's

358
00:29:13,091 --> 00:29:15,070
characteristic of the slowness in reforms.

359
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:19,420
They are moderate and
therefore unsatisfactory.

360
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,080
That is they don't solve
the problems that are there.

361
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,540
But that doesn't mean they
are not worth anything.

362
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,810
For one thing they ameliorate the problem.

363
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,150
And therefore the ameliorate
the discontent and the
danger to the freedom of the

364
00:29:34,151 --> 00:29:34,984
Athenians.

365
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,200
But they also sometimes set the stage
for the elimination of the problem over

366
00:29:42,341 --> 00:29:47,341
time because ways are found obviously
for people to manage these things if the

367
00:29:49,181 --> 00:29:54,181
possibility of debt slavery is taken
away in other forms of managing these

368
00:29:55,151 --> 00:29:59,410
things will assert themselves.
And indeed what we find.

369
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:03,040
And I must say what I'm going to
tell you doesn't solve the mystery.

370
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:07,900
But what we find as you get to the fifth
century the classical period in Athens

371
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:13,060
is an extraordinary situation
because it's so good and so unusual.

372
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,600
And that is that most Athenian
farmers in the fifth century

373
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:26,910
seemed to have small but adequate
family farms that allow many many many

374
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:34,261
Athenians to live in a very satisfactory
way given the expectations that they

375
00:30:34,481 --> 00:30:35,314
had

376
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:41,350
it never abolished great big land holding
arrangements that some people had.

377
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:45,910
There always were throughout Athenian
history no matter how thoroughly

378
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:47,380
Democratic state became.

379
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,780
There always were great differences of
wealth between very wealthy people and

380
00:30:52,781 --> 00:30:53,650
very poor people.

381
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:58,680
But what is extraordinary and what
would have been very satisfactory to the

382
00:30:58,931 --> 00:31:03,931
Greek political thinkers even
the Aristotle for instance
in the fourth century

383
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:09,510
is that there was a great middle ground
in which the people were pretty much

384
00:31:11,891 --> 00:31:16,891
like each other in their economic
condition which produces the greatest

385
00:31:18,491 --> 00:31:23,491
stability the greatest satisfaction the
greatest capacity for self-government.

386
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,230
So that was one of the consequences
although it didn't happen as any direct

387
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,860
action by Solana

388
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:37,270
We are also told by Aristotle
and other ancient sources that

389
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:43,830
so changed the coin standard for Athens
from one that was used in the West in

390
00:31:47,681 --> 00:31:52,480
the Peloponnese US and in the West to
one that was used in the east and they

391
00:31:52,481 --> 00:31:54,240
changed the way from the the.

392
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,600
I don't even measures if I don't even
coin standard to the you Bolek standard

393
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:06,310
which as people try to understand why and
how that would work it would have made

394
00:32:06,311 --> 00:32:10,130
trade with the Aegean and the east better.

395
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:15,570
And of course we know that that's the
area that the Athenians are exploiting

396
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:21,210
vigorously now although we must recognize
it when the Athenians get rolling in

397
00:32:21,581 --> 00:32:25,480
the trade business they do
tremendously well in the West as well.

398
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:29,260
But there's a bigger problem with the
story about these coins than any other.

399
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:34,830
As you know if what I told you before
the almost universal opinion of coin

400
00:32:35,201 --> 00:32:38,930
experts is how could he change the coin
standards. There weren't any coins yet.

401
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,740
Now you're really going to believe them
are you going to believe Aristotle.

402
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,280
You know where I am.
Okay.

403
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:53,220
In other steps that turned out to
be very important in the long run.

404
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:59,150
He encouraged the use of the not of
the use of the land for the purpose of

405
00:33:02,851 --> 00:33:07,851
producing cash crops like olive oil and
wine and the Athenians do use more and

406
00:33:10,501 --> 00:33:15,360
more of their soil largely because there's
more and more of their soil that can

407
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:20,361
grow that and nothing else but as
they do the consequence is to make the

408
00:33:21,901 --> 00:33:26,901
agricultural output of Athens much more
diversified than it had been which saves

409
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:32,820
you know more diverse your crops the less
chance you have to be wiped out in any

410
00:33:32,821 --> 00:33:37,821
one year by bad results and it is matter
of fact over time it became a very

411
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:45,020
satisfactory device and helps explain
again the health of Athenian agriculture

412
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:48,720
when we see it in the
fifth century and later

413
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,000
another thing that he did
you know I should I'm gonna
talk about citizenship for

414
00:33:54,001 --> 00:33:54,834
a moment.

415
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:59,970
The Greek police were very
jealous of their citizenship.

416
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:05,120
Their theory of the polls was that all
citizens were the descendants of the

417
00:34:07,051 --> 00:34:09,570
original founders of the city.

418
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:15,200
In other words everybody in Athens
was a relative of some kind.

419
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,450
Of course it wasn't true.

420
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,030
Certainly in Athens we know there
were many immigrants and so on.

421
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,360
But the fact remains that that was the
normal thinking about it and the notion

422
00:34:26,671 --> 00:34:31,671
of the power the sent tragedy of the
concept of Polis to them is something we

423
00:34:32,851 --> 00:34:36,720
need to understand and that they were
jealous of it and selfish with it.

424
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:41,310
This was not something they would simply
allow people to acquire if they wanted

425
00:34:41,311 --> 00:34:45,720
it this place is us and it's not them.

426
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,090
And we don't make people citizens.

427
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:54,010
And that was essentially the thing to
be a citizen of Athens in those days you

428
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:56,500
had to have a father who
was a citizen of Athens.

429
00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:00,870
Nothing else would do the trick.
But someone changed that.

430
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,600
So long offered citizenship to individuals
who came to Athens to settle and had

431
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,720
a say could could show that they had a
valuable skill a valuable craft and the

432
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:24,720
results were that Athens would become
in the decades following so long a great

433
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:30,100
center for the manufacturing
of a variety of things.

434
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:35,430
Pottery is what we have and great painting
painted pottery is a great part of

435
00:35:35,771 --> 00:35:37,390
the Athenian tradition.

436
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:42,720
But sculpture also and all kinds of
things that we probably don't have because

437
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,220
they would have been destroyed by time.

438
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:50,230
But the idea was if you were a skilled
craftsman you could become you come to

439
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,350
Athens and you would not have to
be what you would otherwise be.

440
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,920
Anybody who came to Athens not under
these rules would could stay could make up

441
00:36:00,371 --> 00:36:05,371
himself a permanent resident but he would
always be what the Greeks called a Met

442
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,143
oil costs.

443
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:12,240
We say in English a metric meaning a
resident alien never to be a citizen.

444
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:19,140
Only citizens were permitted to own land
in Attica only citizens had access to

445
00:36:20,861 --> 00:36:25,480
the Athenian courts a noncitizen who
had to go to court for one reason or

446
00:36:25,481 --> 00:36:29,410
another would have to find a
citizen to be his spokesman.

447
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,800
So you really were cut off from somewhere
and of course a noncitizen could not

448
00:36:35,501 --> 00:36:40,501
participate in the political life of
Athens either but these people were not

449
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:45,550
going to be medics because of the
economic skills that they brought so long

450
00:36:45,551 --> 00:36:49,420
arranged for them to
become Athenian citizens.

451
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,710
Very rare thing.

452
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:54,580
We will have a couple of other occasions
in this course until then take a look

453
00:36:54,581 --> 00:36:59,350
at a moment when foreigners were permitted
to come to Athens and become citizens.

454
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,470
But they're very rare.

455
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,460
And there's always something
very special connected with them.

456
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:07,630
And there will always be some Athenians
who will raise at least one eyebrow at

457
00:37:07,631 --> 00:37:11,320
the idea of making a
foreigner a citizen of Athens.

458
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:15,940
But it turned out to be one
of those things that have
that so on instituted that

459
00:37:15,941 --> 00:37:20,941
would have long range consequences
helpful to the Athenian state well so much

460
00:37:22,191 --> 00:37:25,160
for the economic and social issues.

461
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:29,810
Let's turn to the constitutional
questions because of course by when you're

462
00:37:29,811 --> 00:37:34,811
talking about an independent republic
then the political and constitutional

463
00:37:35,961 --> 00:37:38,750
arrangements are obviously
critical to everybody.

464
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:42,710
I guess it's true in any society
but it's blatant in a republic.

465
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:48,950
So someone changed the
Athenian constitution up
to this moment the Athenian

466
00:37:50,271 --> 00:37:54,290
constitution came to be what it was
in the way that these things happen in

467
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:58,500
nature namely through tradition.
They just kind of grow.

468
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:03,700
Nobody nobody legislates but so
on was appointed to legislate.

469
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,100
And he was going to attempt to
deal with the problems that he saw.

470
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:16,170
So what he did first of all was to arrange
Athenian political society on a new

471
00:38:18,701 --> 00:38:19,360
basis.

472
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:24,360
This is a very large matter up to now
where you were in the state whether you

473
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:30,910
could serve on the council whether you
could be a magistrate dependent upon your

474
00:38:30,911 --> 00:38:35,911
birth aristocrats alone
could hold these positions.

475
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:42,480
Now that was swept away by Solana's
new system he changed it so that the

476
00:38:44,311 --> 00:38:49,311
determination of who was eligible to
serve in these councils and offices was

477
00:38:49,531 --> 00:38:54,250
based on the wealth that
they had just to show you.

478
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:58,910
And this is an argument against the
coinage being present in that day.

479
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:04,010
He did not fix the rating of
Citizens for these jobs in money.

480
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:10,460
He rated them in measures of agricultural
produce whether dry produce or liquid

481
00:39:13,591 --> 00:39:15,540
produce equally available.

482
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:20,780
These measures of produce were
called medium Noi measures.

483
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,360
So here's how we worked it out at the
top of the scale. There were five.

484
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:32,630
You had to have each year
products produced by your
land which were worth five

485
00:39:34,761 --> 00:39:38,370
hundred Madame Noi at least.

486
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:44,120
So the people who held in that position
that condition were described as get

487
00:39:45,061 --> 00:39:45,300
ready.

488
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:50,300
This is a job breaker Pentecost CEO
Madame Noi which just means five hundred

489
00:39:50,761 --> 00:39:51,594
measurement.

490
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:57,510
That is obviously a new term a new
concept didn't exist before so it makes no

491
00:39:57,511 --> 00:39:58,344
sense.

492
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:03,120
So someone had to invent that to take
care of a certain class of people that he

493
00:40:03,121 --> 00:40:03,954
wanted.

494
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:09,090
But the next class down was probably
almost certainly used for a condition that

495
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,950
was already recognized but didn't have
a formal place in the Constitution.

496
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:19,470
People with three hundred measures a
year but not five hundred were called hip

497
00:40:19,471 --> 00:40:21,690
pace meaning cavalryman.

498
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,720
I use that term in another place
before and then people with two hundred

499
00:40:26,931 --> 00:40:31,931
measures but not three hundred were zoo
Gotye yoke fellow as you remember yoke

500
00:40:32,481 --> 00:40:37,481
men and then those below two hundred
were feats and they were the lowest class

501
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:44,000
in the Athenian Society
invented by someone again
that was an old term the only

502
00:40:44,001 --> 00:40:47,630
one that he invented was
the Pentecost yo Madam NOI

503
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,910
and of course the critical thing about
it more whatever else I say about this

504
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:57,911
the important thing it broke the
monopoly of aristocrats by birth in the

505
00:40:59,061 --> 00:41:04,061
political realm the first two classes
Pentecostal home Adam NOI and hip pace

506
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,620
could hold the Archon ships and only they.

507
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:15,470
Now the Zuber tie as I think I mentioned
to you before were essentially the hop

508
00:41:15,471 --> 00:41:20,471
like class that meant they could not hold
the top jobs in the state on the other

509
00:41:24,911 --> 00:41:29,911
hand he established a council of four
hundred the word for council in Greek is

510
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:36,540
bu Lei so this bu lay of 400 Xu Gotye
could serve on that and we we never will

511
00:41:40,781 --> 00:41:45,781
really know what the powers
of that council were because
it doesn't seem but as

512
00:41:46,811 --> 00:41:51,190
we shall see so once Constitution was
never really put into effect in all its

513
00:41:51,191 --> 00:41:55,720
respects although this business about
the measures was put into effect

514
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:02,910
but I think we can guess by analogy to
other councils that it would have had

515
00:42:02,951 --> 00:42:07,951
considerable power that it would have
decided many things would not have been an

516
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:11,170
empty honor to be on the Council of 400

517
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:18,190
nor were the seats excluded from political
power entirely they of course made up

518
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:24,581
a part of the assembly the Greek word
is a clay C up and that there was

519
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:31,040
certainly a net Clay C before so long you
always in any state that we know of in

520
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:36,041
the Greek world if you want to go to war
you must go to the army now the seats

521
00:42:36,861 --> 00:42:41,000
didn't fight as hot lights but they
could fight as light on the troops so I'm

522
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:46,001
sure they were consulted although it
was pretty much a formality nonetheless

523
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:52,750
that's not no but what is
new and extremely important
is that so on invents a

524
00:42:54,201 --> 00:42:58,650
new kind of court
it is cold in.

525
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,390
The heli Aya

526
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,850
and what it is is a court of appeal

527
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:11,570
all this time before every magistrate
as I believe I mentioned had a court of

528
00:43:12,601 --> 00:43:17,020
his own that dealt with matters
that were appropriate to his court.

529
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,630
And that was the end of it.

530
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:24,710
I suppose theoretically and probably
in reality sometimes if somebody didn't

531
00:43:25,141 --> 00:43:29,850
like what a magistrate decided in the
court he could go to the area of us and in

532
00:43:29,851 --> 00:43:34,500
very rare occasions I would imagine Gary
octopus could do something about it.

533
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:39,530
But I think what we have to assume is
that a decision by the magistrate's court

534
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:42,800
was it and the game was over heli Aya.

535
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:47,880
On the other hand was a court of appeals.
That's critical.

536
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:53,360
Anybody who didn't like the decision
that he got in a magistrates court could

537
00:43:53,551 --> 00:43:58,080
take it to a heli IO and then
have that decision overturned.

538
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:03,500
If the court so decided and that court
was a truly popular court it was open to

539
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:10,700
all adult male Athenian
citizens even the seats.

540
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,620
That is something very
new really quite radical.

541
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:22,310
The most radical elements surely in this
very moderate program that that so long

542
00:44:24,511 --> 00:44:26,340
puts forward notice.

543
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:32,300
He still gives the aristocracy privileges
that nobody else has in the right to

544
00:44:33,721 --> 00:44:38,721
hold the I say aristocracy but I mean
the richest people in the state in that

545
00:44:39,421 --> 00:44:43,530
they alone can hold the arcane ship which
would have been troubling to the poor.

546
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:48,740
But then he gives this new founded
court of appeals to the poorest Athenian

547
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:53,340
citizens which would certainly
have rankled the rich.

548
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:59,030
And that's characteristic of
what he is up to this court.

549
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:00,343
Here's the way it.

550
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:07,100
Every year Athenians could volunteer
to be enrolled in the panel that would

551
00:45:08,461 --> 00:45:10,350
produce the courts of the heli.

552
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,850
And the number of Athenians on
on this panel was six thousand.

553
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,900
And then on any occasion when there
had to be an actual court case then the

554
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:26,480
members people on the on the enrolled
list there would be some way of picking

555
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,980
the numbers you needed for the jury.

556
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:33,240
We know how it worked in the classical
period but we can't be sure it work the

557
00:45:33,241 --> 00:45:34,880
same way.
And so lunch time.

558
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:39,950
But in the classical period it's a very
complicated way of choosing jurors which

559
00:45:41,191 --> 00:45:42,270
was a.

560
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:47,490
But such a wonderfully complicated
allotment device that it guaranteed that

561
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:51,690
nobody would know who was going to sit
on a particular jury until they walked

562
00:45:51,691 --> 00:45:56,691
into the room and began to hear the case
and that was to avoid corruption of a

563
00:45:57,871 --> 00:45:58,704
jury.

564
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:03,690
So whether that system was in play or
not I don't think it was in the detail.

565
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,540
And so on time the idea should be clear.

566
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:12,050
These things are really going to be
unfixable and ordinary Athenians are going

567
00:46:12,421 --> 00:46:17,421
to be the ones who are
making the decisions later
theoreticians of politics of

568
00:46:18,301 --> 00:46:23,301
democracy would fix on that as the single
most important step towards democracy

569
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,130
that the Athenians would ultimately reach.

570
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:34,460
But by no means would Solon's constitution
if it had been put into effect have

571
00:46:35,551 --> 00:46:37,710
amounted to a thoroughgoing democracy.

572
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:43,010
And yet the tradition always was
there that so long had done something

573
00:46:43,171 --> 00:46:47,040
democratic because as you go into the
fourth century people looking back without

574
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:49,890
any real good knowledge of what
went on back in those days.

575
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:54,930
Some of them listed so long
as the founder of Democracy.

576
00:46:56,010 --> 00:47:00,390
But it's also true that the general on
understanding was not wrong about this

577
00:47:00,391 --> 00:47:05,280
because there was the same tradition at
the same time that it wasn't the same

578
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:08,340
kind of democracy we have
now in the fifth century.

579
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:13,790
It is it was less democratic and that
I think those traditions were correct.

580
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:16,523
But

581
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:20,850
moderation again is the example
of what I'm talking about.

582
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:27,690
Well brilliant marvelous someone was so
clever he realized that when you're a

583
00:47:28,181 --> 00:47:33,040
moderate the wonderful achievement of
a moderate person is that everybody is

584
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:33,874
dissatisfied

585
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:38,650
because the guys on that end are unhappy
in the guise of our own that they're

586
00:47:38,651 --> 00:47:39,484
unhappy.

587
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:43,210
And so he knew that they would immediately
be efforts to overthrow what he had

588
00:47:43,211 --> 00:47:44,044
done.

589
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:49,230
And so he one of his stipulations was
that the Athenians would have to leave his

590
00:47:50,861 --> 00:47:53,770
laws unchanged for ten years.

591
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,290
And he also knew that his own life
would be extremely uncomfortable hanging

592
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:02,890
around Athens while everybody came and
said What the hell did you do so long.

593
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:08,490
And so he left town and we're trapped
went on his travels for ten years after

594
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:09,724
that.

595
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:14,950
Well it saved him a lot of grief
but it didn't save his legislation.

596
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,800
Because there was tremendous strife in
Athens after the year of Solon's ship.

597
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,850
Indeed something resembling chaos.

598
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:30,350
I think they were
technically years of anarchy.

599
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:35,420
That is to say there was so much dispute
and conflict in Athens that they were

600
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:40,480
unable to elect the nine hour cons just
years with no outcomes no name for the

601
00:48:41,781 --> 00:48:45,590
year.
That was how serious the conflict was

602
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:52,510
and what emerges in our records about
what was happening is that localism

603
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:58,230
regionalism was very powerful in Attica
and it was regionalism that was a large

604
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:02,230
part of the problem in this period.

605
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:07,920
Important figures in the aristocracy from
different parts of Attica each sought

606
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:14,940
to make itself the dominant
force in Athenian society
and to bring about changes

607
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:20,020
that were satisfactory to them but
they ran into the fact that they had

608
00:49:20,021 --> 00:49:24,640
competition to make it more complicated
wasn't even a nice one against one thing.

609
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:30,450
There were three factions that were
identified by the Greeks and by the

610
00:49:31,241 --> 00:49:34,660
Athenians and they all
struggle one against the other.

611
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:44,480
Let's start with the regional
character of these places

612
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:50,150
one such region was called
the people in their faction.

613
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:51,530
Let me back up.

614
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:55,970
The region was called Peralta and the
people who were in the factional called

615
00:49:55,971 --> 00:50:00,971
parolee ie pro rally oi modern scholars
identify the parolee with the southern

616
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:10,150
tip of Attica starting some distance
up from Sunni him on the West Coast and

617
00:50:11,511 --> 00:50:13,850
carrying a little bit
around to the east coast.

618
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:19,870
And that was a region that was dominated
by that family I've mentioned to you

619
00:50:21,861 --> 00:50:26,861
earlier that then family that was held
responsible for the killing of the

620
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,760
supporters of Kyla.

621
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:35,230
That family was the alchemy on day and
their leading figure at the moment we're

622
00:50:35,841 --> 00:50:40,841
talking about was a man called Mega
Cleaves who was one of the competitors for

623
00:50:43,581 --> 00:50:45,240
the leading position in Attica.

624
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:52,600
According to the ancient writers of the
fourth century very hard to know how

625
00:50:53,191 --> 00:50:55,470
much they really knew about it
it's a matter of speculation.

626
00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:00,500
But anyway what they say is these
people wanted a middling moderate

627
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:03,990
constitution.

628
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:09,200
They were probably very close to trying
to retain the slowness in legislation.

629
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:16,020
Another faction were called the PDR coy

630
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:23,070
and they represented the middling part
of Attica which is in fact the very best

631
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:31,181
land in Attica where the grain and wheat
especially were global and the richest

632
00:51:33,651 --> 00:51:35,450
people had their land.

633
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:41,110
Their leader was a man named like
Fergus and they represented the old

634
00:51:42,261 --> 00:51:46,880
aristocracy more than any other group
and would have undoubtedly if they'd had

635
00:51:46,881 --> 00:51:51,881
their way just undone the colonial
laws and gone back to the old days

636
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:59,190
they favored some kind of oligarchic
regime and then the third group lived in

637
00:52:02,711 --> 00:52:07,400
the region called D Korea and
they were called the cream boy.

638
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:11,440
Sometimes some of our sources
say who parent Ackroyd.

639
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:15,570
I'll come back to that in just a moment.
Well Miles we'll talk about it now.

640
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:21,810
It is identified with the region on
the east coast of Attica and which was

641
00:52:24,281 --> 00:52:25,490
called the Democracy.

642
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:30,520
But it's why they might have been called
Hooper our Chris why is that there were

643
00:52:30,521 --> 00:52:35,521
some mountains between central Attica
and the Acharya which meant so that.

644
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:40,840
I mean beyond the mountains.

645
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:44,620
And that would have been a
geographical description of the region.

646
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:51,370
It's the leader of this faction
was a man called Pi sister Tess

647
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:57,470
who was as matter of fact he
was a nobleman an aristocrat.

648
00:52:57,950 --> 00:53:02,950
All of them were but he his family had
come from the Peloponnese as back in the

649
00:53:05,541 --> 00:53:10,541
years of the Great Migration following
the fall of the Meissen the world.

650
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:16,660
And that shows you that the Athenians had
brought into their bosoms at that time

651
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:24,071
and made full citizens and aristocrats
and leading people some people from

652
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:25,700
outside of Attica.

653
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,760
Now it was hundreds of years later and
persisted as a rose as the leader of that

654
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,140
place and of those people.

655
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,890
Now he's gonna be very important we
need to say a few more words about him.

656
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:45,590
In the quarrel about what shall be done
what should be done by Sister this and

657
00:53:45,591 --> 00:53:47,540
his group with the most radical.

658
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:53,350
They represented the views of the
poorest people in Attica and pressed for

659
00:53:54,771 --> 00:53:56,900
solutions of the kinds
that they would like

660
00:53:58,450 --> 00:54:01,830
himself had risen to
power in the usual way.

661
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:07,430
He had been a great soldier and had won
great victories for the Athenians and

662
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:12,570
was deeply honored. For that reason
and we'll hear more from him.

663
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:18,590
Ancient writers speak of him as de Motta
Coke to toast the most demotic the most

664
00:54:20,821 --> 00:54:23,910
popular the most democratic if you will.

665
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:30,700
So here are the three factions with
their local places with their different

666
00:54:30,981 --> 00:54:35,540
policies presumably in their different
leaders all struggling for power and

667
00:54:35,541 --> 00:54:40,380
sufficiently equal in strength so
that nobody could come out on top.

668
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,193
Out of this.

669
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:47,260
And by the way when on comes home and the
situation is as unsatisfactory as I've

670
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:54,870
described so long as becomes particularly
worried about my sister this whom he

671
00:54:55,941 --> 00:55:00,941
has spotted as a potential tyrant and
he goes out and he warns the people

672
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:06,370
against my sister this but the fact of
the matter is he fails and his warnings

673
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:12,671
and his predictions turn
out to be accurate as pie
sister this does bring about

674
00:55:12,771 --> 00:55:17,771
tyranny in Athens for the stretch of time
that he and his sons will dominate the

675
00:55:21,261 --> 00:55:22,094
place

676
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:28,670
he was engaged in that war against Negara
and was the number one hero in that

677
00:55:29,671 --> 00:55:30,240
war.

678
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:35,240
He was wounded and when he came back
he said that he was in danger from his

679
00:55:37,381 --> 00:55:39,420
enemies who were going to try to kill him.

680
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:42,900
And he asked the people to
supply him with a bodyguard.

681
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:48,830
They did so and he pretty quickly took
the opportunity to use his bodyguard to

682
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:55,581
seize the Acropolis and to make himself
the boss of Athens for a five year

683
00:55:57,881 --> 00:56:02,070
stretch from about five
sixty one to five fifty six.

684
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:05,730
He was able to rule Athens.

685
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:09,240
We know very little about
the details of that period.

686
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:12,420
But he was a proper
tyrant one way or another.

687
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:18,950
Then his the two factions
that were defeated managed
to get their heads together

688
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:25,310
to plot and to overthrow the tyranny
to drive by system it is out.

689
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:30,160
So he goes for a period
of time he goes abroad.

690
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:35,270
He wanders around meets with other
important people goes to see other tyrants

691
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:43,140
becomes friendly with other tyrants
finds one way or another to make a lot of

692
00:56:43,141 --> 00:56:45,810
money and to get very rich.

693
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:51,140
This is important because he is able
to use this money for hiring mercenary

694
00:56:51,631 --> 00:56:56,250
soldiers which will play a large part
in his restoration but not the first

695
00:56:56,251 --> 00:57:01,251
restoration that comes about because
of the two factions that had gotten

696
00:57:01,531 --> 00:57:06,531
together to drive him out had by now
come to quarrel with one another and so

697
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,580
taking advantage of their dissent.

698
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:15,660
He made a deal with one
of the faction leaders.

699
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:20,650
It was our old friend Meghan Cleese the
alchemy in it and now united with mega

700
00:57:20,651 --> 00:57:21,484
Achilles.

701
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:26,570
The two of them drove out their opponents
in the form of like Kirkus and his

702
00:57:27,601 --> 00:57:32,601
people and persistence this
was restored to the tyranny.

703
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,620
Why did Maggie please get out of it.

704
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:39,650
Well he got guarantees that he would be
a big shot and one part of the guarantee

705
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:44,280
was that by Sister those who had
had a wife and children already.

706
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:50,270
I assume she died the first wife now
married the daughter of Megan please in

707
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:55,140
time immemorial. That's the way
to produce political associations.

708
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:59,070
Marry the one and one guy
marries the other one's daughter.

709
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:05,600
So there we are now the story of how my
sister is coming back to power in this

710
00:58:07,501 --> 00:58:12,501
second time is charming and I think
we have to believe it in its general

711
00:58:14,461 --> 00:58:18,240
outlines. Well you can decide
whether you want to or not.

712
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:21,810
The story is told in
a couple of places but

713
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:27,690
Aristotle and his Athenian
Constitution tells it in one way

714
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:34,220
my sister's got a tall beautiful girl.

715
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:40,320
And he dressed her up to look like Athena
and he put her on a chariot and had

716
00:58:42,671 --> 00:58:47,671
her drive through the attic countryside
and people his boys running alongside

717
00:58:49,721 --> 00:58:54,721
her shouted Athena is bringing
back pies sister us to Athens.

718
00:58:56,740 --> 00:59:00,820
Well you're not going to cross
your patron Didi are you.

719
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:07,000
And so they all sort of you can imagine
them just sort of kowtowing and saying

720
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:13,140
Heil My sister is the favorite of Athena
Well the fact that he had a lot of

721
00:59:13,621 --> 00:59:18,300
soldiers and that he had the mega clays
on his side undoubtedly played a large

722
00:59:18,301 --> 00:59:19,750
part in the success.

723
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:24,570
But there he is back and

724
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:31,480
everything would have been all right
I guess except that after a while BAE

725
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:35,060
Systems let me back up a step by system.

726
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:39,820
This is wife the daughter of Megan
please began going home to her father and

727
00:59:39,821 --> 00:59:41,680
mother and telling him the sad stories.

728
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:46,600
She said her husband was not
performing his husband's lead duties.

729
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:50,580
Why was this.
Was she particularly offensive.

730
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:55,380
No there's no such record as that it's
clear enough that what was worrying

731
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:00,400
persist to this was that he did not
want to mess up the clarity of the

732
01:00:00,661 --> 01:00:04,200
succession of his sons to the tyranny.

733
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:09,240
If he had children with Megan please and
they grew up maybe they would contest

734
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:10,643
the succession.

735
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,280
And so it was for his I guess you'd have
to say it was in his role as a loyal

736
01:00:17,371 --> 01:00:21,390
and devoted father that he got
himself into all kinds of trouble.

737
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:26,720
Well Meghan please felt a the insult be
the fact that his grandchildren would

738
01:00:27,841 --> 01:00:28,860
not be in charge.

739
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:34,280
And finally I have to believe even in a
Greek father feeling that his daughter

740
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:40,190
had been done wrong and so he joined up
with the opposition kicked out by Sister

741
01:00:43,061 --> 01:00:48,061
this one more time in this
second exile of five sisters.

742
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:50,223
We.

743
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:55,370
He goes to various places to raise
all kinds of money gets mercenaries.

744
01:00:56,250 --> 01:01:00,570
He is supported by and this will
play a role in later events.

745
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:06,140
He gets very friendly with the cavalryman
the horsemen the nobility of a red

746
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:11,510
area a town in the northern part of the
island of Nubia just off the east coast

747
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,870
of Attica.

748
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:17,130
And by the way of course remember
persisted as comes from that area the east

749
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:22,131
coast of Attica and regionalism will not
disappear from Attica for some time and

750
01:01:22,471 --> 01:01:24,180
that is significant.

751
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:29,100
Anyway he gets all kinds of help from
overseas and his wealth and all that.

752
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:33,900
And this time he's just going to fight
his way back no tricks no goddesses.

753
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:39,380
He lands at Marathon which
has the advantage to him
of being very close to UBS

754
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,340
where he's been operating with
his friends in the rhetoric.

755
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,880
It also has a nice flat place for cavalry
and I'm sure he acquired cavalryman

756
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:55,290
among the mercenaries that he hired.

757
01:01:55,620 --> 01:02:00,600
All of that allows him to get his forces
together and sure enough when he lands

758
01:02:00,601 --> 01:02:05,601
at marathon that's his home territory
and all his people come rallying round to

759
01:02:05,881 --> 01:02:10,881
him and now he has a good sized army of
Athenians and mercenaries and he marches

760
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:16,430
inland and in the middle land of
Attica at a place called Bellini.

761
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:21,890
He meets his opponents and defeats them
in battle and makes himself the tyrant

762
01:02:25,291 --> 01:02:28,320
of Athens once again.
And

763
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,150
one of the things he does by a trick.

764
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:37,180
Very soon after coming to power is to
disarm the Athenian people so that he is

765
01:02:37,731 --> 01:02:40,520
now ruling in a truly tyrannical way.

766
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:45,850
In that sense there's not
much of a pretense at having
achieved this position by

767
01:02:47,871 --> 01:02:48,920
the popular will.

768
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:54,250
He's done so by force and trickery and
he's prepared to maintain his his power

769
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:00,520
in those ways but in his actual government
of Attica and Athens in the remainder

770
01:03:04,691 --> 01:03:09,691
of his life tradition is pretty
clear that he did not rule harshly.

771
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:16,290
If you think of the word tyrannical
as meaning harsh he did not rule too

772
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,170
radically.

773
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:22,170
In fact later writers described the
way he ruled Athens and it's this last

774
01:03:22,301 --> 01:03:27,301
period that they're talking about I think
as one that was politic costs meaning

775
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:33,340
moderately and in accordance with
the way a polis should be run.

776
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,470
Which does not include tyranny.

777
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:41,250
And in fact some later writers picture
of the rule of pipe sister cities as a

778
01:03:42,191 --> 01:03:44,440
golden age in Athens.

779
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:48,060
We'll come back to that
perhaps but there you have it.

780
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:51,970
There are two edges to this thing there's
the notion my God establish a charity

781
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,910
which later on in Athens would be the
worst thing in the world you could do.

782
01:03:55,150 --> 01:04:00,150
And yet there's this alongside it this
tradition of a decent government under my

783
01:04:01,781 --> 01:04:03,730
system.
Well let's see what he did.

784
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:09,750
One thing he did was not to repeal the
laws of so long they may never have been

785
01:04:11,651 --> 01:04:16,600
put into full effect because of the
turmoil but no one had ever said that not

786
01:04:16,601 --> 01:04:17,830
the law anymore.

787
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:23,100
In fact by system this let them be and
in fact he allowed them to function as

788
01:04:25,421 --> 01:04:29,980
they should in other words I would think
that there was a council of 400 that

789
01:04:29,981 --> 01:04:33,650
was elected every year and met there.
We know there were magistrates.

790
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:37,450
There are cons elected in the
appropriate way each year.

791
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:45,530
Translate the law courts even met in the
way that they were supposed to but what

792
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:53,660
persisted as did was not to change
the Constitution but to dominate it.

793
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:58,410
I think you have to imagine that
there is the rule of a boss.

794
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:00,480
He doesn't change the laws.

795
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:05,510
He just sees to it that all
the appropriate bodies are
controlled by his people.

796
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:11,930
That for an analogy is the
way the mandatory governed
in Florence when they made

797
01:05:13,861 --> 01:05:16,320
themselves the rulers of that republic.

798
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:22,200
It is true.
You can't be just totally gentle.

799
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:25,110
You have to take care of your enemies
because they're going to be enemies out

800
01:05:25,111 --> 01:05:25,920
there.

801
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:30,920
So my sister is surely exiled
some aristocratic families
the ones who wouldn't

802
01:05:32,731 --> 01:05:33,690
cut a deal with him.

803
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:38,550
The ones who wouldn't play ball out they
went and we know that for some part of

804
01:05:38,551 --> 01:05:43,551
the time we don't know just when he exiled
the alchemy and it's of course he had

805
01:05:44,581 --> 01:05:48,810
this quarrel with mega clique so that
was not a surprise and they could not

806
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:53,010
readily be made complacent.
What was going on.

807
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:58,250
Although we do have this is remarkable
we have an actual inscription which is

808
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:03,920
blatantly a list of our cousins who
were held office in Athens and after my

809
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:12,620
sister this is death in the period when
his sons ruled Athens one of the names

810
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:19,340
as Arkan of the city was Kleist Denise
who was in alchemy it which means makes

811
01:06:21,121 --> 01:06:26,121
it perfectly clear that at least later
in the day the out minutes came back into

812
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:27,480
Attica.

813
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:32,370
We have to imagine that by system this
rule this thing with great savvy and

814
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:37,290
there was always time to come home if
you will be a good boy and do what my

815
01:06:37,291 --> 01:06:41,430
sister told you to do.
And I think that happens in many cases.

816
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:49,740
One of the things he did it was very
popular was to invent the institution of

817
01:06:51,191 --> 01:06:52,480
circuit judges.

818
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:58,350
That is to say it used to be that if
you were an Athenian citizen then you

819
01:06:58,481 --> 01:06:59,800
wanted to go to law.

820
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:04,840
Originally of course you had no choice
but to go to the local big shot and have

821
01:07:04,841 --> 01:07:08,580
this local aristocrats settle the matter
as had been the case in the days of he

822
01:07:08,581 --> 01:07:09,414
said.

823
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:14,740
But under Solon's system at the very
least you could go to the magistrate in

824
01:07:15,551 --> 01:07:20,551
Athens if you wanted to and you could
even appeal to his decision if you wanted

825
01:07:22,211 --> 01:07:23,044
to.

826
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:29,160
But here's the problem what if you lived
in Sunni and you lived miles and miles

827
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:31,120
and miles away from this.

828
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:36,310
What are the chances that you would in
fact or could go to the city to receive

829
01:07:36,311 --> 01:07:37,510
the justice that you needed.

830
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:42,530
So by establishing circuit justice brought
courts that were objective that were

831
01:07:43,691 --> 01:07:45,820
not dominated by the local barons.

832
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:51,160
He was doing a real service
to the ordinary Athenian
citizen and that was seen

833
01:07:51,370 --> 01:07:55,540
to be a good thing.
But it was also of course in his interest.

834
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:58,690
He doesn't want local big
shots being big shots.

835
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:03,280
There's only room in the tyranny for
one big shot. And that is the tyrant.

836
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:04,870
And so he's doing his.

837
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:10,060
He's serving himself breaking down local
power unifying the state into a single

838
01:08:13,361 --> 01:08:18,361
thing which is good in all kinds of
ways but it's also good for the tyrant.

839
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:25,030
Now the next thing I'm
going to say is supposition.

840
01:08:25,150 --> 01:08:29,230
We don't have any ancient evidence for
it and its course is open to doubt.

841
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:35,100
But I would argue that he must have
confiscated some of the land of the

842
01:08:37,841 --> 01:08:42,730
aristocrats who opposed him and
with whom he did not make a deal.

843
01:08:43,570 --> 01:08:46,780
And I say that pretty
much only for this reason

844
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:53,660
before my sister this we have the great
story of great differences in land

845
01:08:56,401 --> 01:09:01,401
holding between very very big landowners
and very very small lands and those who

846
01:09:01,531 --> 01:09:06,531
own no land at all producing the problem
nothing so long did directly affected

847
01:09:07,651 --> 01:09:08,530
that situation.

848
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:13,980
But when we get into the fifth century
the evidence is overwhelming that we have

849
01:09:13,981 --> 01:09:14,370
what I see.

850
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:19,370
But I spoke of earlier lots and lots of
medium moderate family sized farms some

851
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:25,260
big farms but these are not what
are characteristic of the place.

852
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:28,230
Well how did that happen.
When did that happen.

853
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:33,570
My guess is probably past
history has brought that about.

854
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:39,080
And if so it would have been still
another reason why he had broad popularity

855
01:09:40,650 --> 01:09:42,000
remarkable popularity.

856
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:48,360
The ancient sources do tell us that
among the things that he did was to spend

857
01:09:48,511 --> 01:09:51,510
money on farmers.

858
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:56,100
That is he would give money or lend
money to farmers who needed it when they

859
01:09:56,101 --> 01:10:00,960
needed it which is of course one of
the issues constantly before the small

860
01:10:00,961 --> 01:10:05,961
farmers of Attica so they could with the
money they borrowed they could buy more

861
01:10:08,731 --> 01:10:13,731
land make their farm more self-sustaining
they could pay off debts that they owe

862
01:10:14,371 --> 01:10:19,371
to other people they could do the things
that these small farmers have to do to

863
01:10:19,411 --> 01:10:22,020
succeed namely buy the
equipment they need.

864
01:10:22,230 --> 01:10:27,230
Olive presses wine presses mills they
should they could get use their loans for

865
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:34,190
planting fruit trees olive trees all of
these things could have been part of the

866
01:10:35,221 --> 01:10:40,221
story of how a Athenian agriculture
came to be so so successful.

867
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,060
After the time of the tyrants
as they had not been before.

868
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:50,150
Now there's one negative thing that
I'm sure nobody liked prices for this

869
01:10:50,151 --> 01:10:55,151
instituted the first regular direct tax
that we know of in Athenian history a 5

870
01:10:57,621 --> 01:11:02,621
percent tax on all that was produced
from the land and that that money went to

871
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:11,390
pay sister this made him wealthy but also
provided him with the money he needed

872
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:14,780
to beat his good fellow
that I have been describing.

873
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:19,220
So it all assisted his political
power and his popularity.

874
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:23,560
But even there that should have
been the worst thing he ever did.

875
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:25,660
Tyrants laid down taxes.

876
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:29,360
Taxes are evidence of
tyranny and all that.

877
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:34,190
That's a totally the picture we get.
Aristotle tells this story.

878
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:39,330
One day my sister this
was traveling around the
countryside of Attica as a guest

879
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:44,210
he sometimes did and he went up on the
slopes of Mount high meadows not too far

880
01:11:44,211 --> 01:11:45,320
from the city of Athens.

881
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:49,190
You go up there today the
notion of anybody farming
on that mountain is totally

882
01:11:49,191 --> 01:11:50,024
incredible.

883
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:54,020
Nothing you could possibly grow on
Mountain Meadows but it's been deforested.

884
01:11:54,650 --> 01:11:55,483
By that time.

885
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:00,320
So anyway it was an still lousy I mean
mountains are not great places for farms.

886
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:01,183
You may have noticed.

887
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:06,550
So anyway it goes up to this farmer and
he says say farmer what do you grow on

888
01:12:09,171 --> 01:12:10,004
your farm.

889
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:15,400
The farmer you might have to imagine a
gnarled old mean nasty old guy saying on

890
01:12:16,911 --> 01:12:19,940
my farm I grow rocks

891
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:25,070
and my sister this is
welcome to his 5 percent.

892
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:31,840
Well that did my sister to stay off with
his head or send him on to the moon.

893
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:35,630
He said Well aren't you
a cute little fellow.

894
01:12:36,170 --> 01:12:41,170
I hereby declare your farm
exempt from taxes forever.

895
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:45,560
And it became a famous
thing that tax free farm.

896
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,180
It shows up in a business
teen encyclopedia.

897
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:51,530
That story that is still being told.

898
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:55,640
So that's you've got a very
special kind of tie right here.

899
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:59,930
We'll turn to the rest of his reign
and that of his sons. Next time.
