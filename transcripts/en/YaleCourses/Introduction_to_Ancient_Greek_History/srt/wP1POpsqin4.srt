1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:06,590
Well as we continue with our investigation
of the emergence and development of

2
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:11,871
the polls we come to the polls that just
to use its proper name is in Greek lock

3
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,920
a dime on the last the demon we say.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,890
And that is the proper Greek name for it.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,460
But the capital city of it was Sparta
and its pit bull were called Spartans.

6
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,900
So it's reasonable.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,920
You know it's OK to keep talking
about Sparta and Spartans.

8
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,730
Now when you come to Sparta you are
coming to a policy that you almost want to

9
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:44,940
spell it in capital letters
with stars between them.

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,420
It's like the pole is lifted to a new
level in the sense of all the sort of

11
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:57,771
theoretical elements and psychological
elements that go into creating a Polis is

12
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,610
intensified in Sparta to such a degree
that it it seems to be almost a different

13
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:11,391
thing and it's important to remember
that the other Greeks felt that way too.

14
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,770
Sparta had a special place in
their minds and their imaginations.

15
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,360
They admired the Spartans very very
much because the Spartans carried to the

16
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,060
extreme degree the feeling that the polis
was the center of a Greek man's life

17
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,840
and that it had the virtues that
were associated with the post to an

18
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:44,550
extraordinary degree.

19
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:50,160
Now they admired it very very much but
they didn't admire it so much they were

20
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:54,930
ready to live like the Spartans
because the price was very high indeed.

21
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,380
One other thing to remember as we take
a look at the way the Spartans lived was

22
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:03,960
that they became a sort of a model.

23
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,560
For the philosophers who came along in
the late 50s and into the fourth century

24
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:16,690
I mean especially Plato and Aristotle
who certainly had some criticisms of the

25
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:23,751
real Sparta that existed but who modeled
their notions of ideal place on Sparta

26
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,740
with the variations that
they wished to introduce. So.

27
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,950
It's worthwhile.

28
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,140
And of course it added to these ideas
and feelings about the Spartans there is

29
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:45,141
the fact that Sparta would emerge in the
6th century as the most powerful of the

30
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,540
police and

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
the first leader of a lasting alliance
of states which create with the Spartans

32
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,180
as the leading power among them the first
international organization you might

33
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:04,960
say.

34
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,960
If you were speaking loosely so that
there is a practical aspect to it the

35
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:14,950
Spartans became the most powerful the
most important state in Greece right down

36
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:19,150
to and including the Persian Wars.

37
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Well first I guess we ought to take a
look at how Sparta got to be what it

38
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,760
ultimately became.

39
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,690
And once again I have to say that all
we can do is to reason from very limited

40
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:43,030
evidence better than what we've had up
to now but still mostly from written

41
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:48,941
evidence that comes from a time after the
facts we are talking about practically

42
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:54,701
no contemporary evidence although we do
have a bit and the archeological remains

43
00:03:56,211 --> 00:03:59,480
that we do have and then reason from that.

44
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,860
Well of course that lead that kind
of reasoning leads to controversy.

45
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,130
And there are different
opinions about all these things.

46
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:12,220
Again what I will be attempting to pass
on to you is the most widely accepted

47
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:18,770
set of opinions about these things but
one cannot be sure that other evidence

48
00:04:18,771 --> 00:04:23,510
might not emerge or new ways of seeing
things might change the picture somewhat.

49
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,260
And as you will see or have seen in
your problems book on one question there

50
00:04:29,781 --> 00:04:32,210
really is no consensus.

51
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,240
But again just a make a majority
opinion as to the question of.

52
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,050
How and when Spada got to be what it was.

53
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,623
So here's the.

54
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,850
The the most common interpretation I
would giving you now the story is you come

55
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:58,901
into the Peloponnese just at the beginning
of the dark ages and it's before the

56
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:04,031
Dorian's have taken over so that the
people inhabiting that area are Greeks who

57
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:11,831
are of the branch of the family who speak
and a keen kind of Greek meaning the

58
00:05:13,851 --> 00:05:18,851
Greeks the language the Greeks
spoke in the Meissen in period.

59
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,043
But.

60
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,420
That's not what they're doing when we
first see them historically and they when

61
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:31,230
they emerge in the form of the people
who will make the Poles by then they are

62
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:36,350
Dorian's who have come into
the Peloponnese at some
point after the fall of the

63
00:05:36,721 --> 00:05:37,590
masonry and world.

64
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,400
And in most places almost all places
have become the dominant people in the

65
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:46,440
Peloponnese.
So.

66
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,400
When you first see anything that is
Sparta we see Dorian's running it.

67
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:00,260
And we see subordinate Greek peoples in
different degrees of subordination who

68
00:06:01,381 --> 00:06:06,381
are presumably a keen Greeks who have
lost out in the competition and who are

69
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,690
under the Spartans.

70
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,750
It looks like from a very early time you
hear about people called Hell lots and

71
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,640
how to define a hell it is not simple.

72
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,930
Hell lots in a certain sense are slaves
but they are not the kind of slaves we

73
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:30,990
are accustomed to think about who belong
to each slave belongs to a particular

74
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:36,110
master they are slaves who belong to the
state to the polis as a whole and then

75
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:40,170
to further complicate matters.

76
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,480
When we come upon them
functioning although they
work they belong to the state

77
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,720
they are assigned to a particular part
of the farm land of the region occupied

78
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:54,870
by Sparta which is called Laconia.

79
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:00,630
They are assigned to that piece of
land which piece of land will also be

80
00:07:00,631 --> 00:07:04,590
assigned to a particular Spartan citizen.

81
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,980
So de facto the highlights are working
the plot that provide the food for a

82
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:14,200
particular Spartan not for
the Spartans in general.

83
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,990
So that's moderately complicated but
the hell lots are going to be a very

84
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:23,991
critical part of the story and of
understanding what makes Sparta tick.

85
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,880
Now there are also from the first
time we hear of the Spartans.

86
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,060
There are people living in Laconia some
of them in the neighborhood of Sparta

87
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,233
but.

88
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,100
They're one of their fundamental defining
characteristics is that they do not

89
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:44,280
live in the city of Sparta.
They are not citizens of Sparta.

90
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:49,330
They are not what the citizens
of Sparta are called Sparta ates.

91
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,283
They are.

92
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:56,360
It looks as though they are probably
Dorian's although we can't be sure about

93
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:58,280
that but it looks as though they are.

94
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:04,090
These people are called Perry boy coy
and their name means people who live

95
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,240
around.
They live around Sparta.

96
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:14,350
That means anywhere in the territory
controlled by the Spartans but not in the

97
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:20,390
city.
And as we shall see they have a.

98
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:26,320
They are in can. They are free. They
are not slaves or serfs or hell us.

99
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:32,530
Each man each Perry oil costs presumably
has a farm that he works for himself.

100
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,300
The Perry boy also are engaged in trade
such as it is in Sparta which is very

101
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:47,711
very small relatively speaking and also
in industry again which is not a big

102
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:53,951
deal but somebody has to be working the
bronze and the iron and making the pots.

103
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,800
And these people would be Perry or coy
because the Spartans as when we finally

104
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:05,120
see them in the developed state of
Sparta won't be doing any of that stuff.

105
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,460
When Sparta is Sparta.

106
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,860
The Sparta eights do only one thing.
Well I guess not.

107
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:16,820
They do two things. They fight.
And they prepare to fight.

108
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:22,030
That's it. They are soldiers.
They do nothing else.

109
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,570
They have no economic function whatsoever.

110
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,140
Now it wasn't always so.
There is

111
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,100
well before I tell you

112
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,750
the story as we tell it today based on
modern interpretations let me tell you

113
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:45,720
what the Greeks and the
Spartans said about it.

114
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,440
They said at one point back there in
those early days there was a man called

115
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:56,810
like Kirkus who brought laws to Sparta
and set up the regime of Sparta as we

116
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:02,170
will know it in the 6th
and the 5th centuries.

117
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,810
But he did it and there's a lot of
arguing arguing about what his date was.

118
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,840
But if you take the ancient Greek sources
seriously maybe in the 9th century

119
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,300
B.C. This was done and so
it was forever there after.

120
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:24,020
Well not only is this date not
widely believed hardly anybody.

121
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,870
Any scholar would take that seriously.

122
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,160
And then people do argue about when
would the changes have taken place.

123
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:37,430
And if there was a like Kirkus when
he would have introduced these laws a

124
00:10:38,161 --> 00:10:42,120
skeptical 19th century
historian put it this way.

125
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:46,170
He said like Kirkus was not a man.

126
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,120
He was only a god.

127
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:54,350
That is to say he was somebody invented
by the Spartans as somebody who put

128
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:55,500
together this.

129
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,500
I myself and you know me I'm credulous
by trade and I believe in the higher

130
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,243
naivety.

131
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,590
I think there might have been a guy
named like Fergus and I think there's a

132
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:12,591
pretty clear if if there was such a man
he probably proposed some laws which

133
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:15,300
became important to the Spartans.

134
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,990
But I am not so completely credulous as
to believe the system was established by

135
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,320
one man.

136
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,220
Way back when and it didn't change
because there's a good deal of evidence to

137
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:30,840
suggest the contrary that
there are developments that
happen that makes part of

138
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:35,841
what it will be ultimately the first sort
of historical event that we know about

139
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,870
and we think we know about Sparta was.

140
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,500
At towards the end of the eighth century
perhaps in the years between seven

141
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:50,691
twenty five and seven hundred there was
a war in which the Spartans conquered

142
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
the neighboring territory to the west
of Laconia which is called Macedonia.

143
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,010
I hope you're becoming familiar.

144
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,790
I hope you're looking at maps a lot and
becoming familiar with the geography of

145
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,830
Greece and the Peloponnese as you know.

146
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:13,370
You can notice to the west there is a
kind of a promontory that comes out and

147
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:18,690
it's on that extreme western side of
the Peloponnese is that messiness is

148
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:21,450
located and it looks like
it's right next to Sparta.

149
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,710
But it is but this an important
thing that you have to be aware of.

150
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,750
There's a mountain range that
separates Sparta from Macedonia.

151
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The Thai agencies range and it is striking
if you go to Sparta and come up from

152
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:40,830
the Spartan port of give the arm
and head up for the town itself.

153
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,860
Pretty soon if you look to your left
there is this really serious range of

154
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:50,961
mountains that makes it clear it was a
barrier it was not something that you

155
00:12:52,111 --> 00:12:56,970
could just think a weight it meant they
were very separate so a Spartan wants to

156
00:12:56,971 --> 00:12:57,804
go to Monsignor.

157
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:03,110
He doesn't just head west he has to go
north and then hang a left at the when

158
00:13:03,181 --> 00:13:07,080
the mountains have stopped and
go around and come on back down.

159
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,710
That's going to be a very important part
of the story of why Sparta is the way

160
00:13:10,711 --> 00:13:11,544
it is.

161
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,010
But the conquest of Macedonia in the first
messiness in war as this is called is

162
00:13:17,011 --> 00:13:20,370
very important because
now the Spartans conquer.

163
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
A very large number of people
whom they turn into hell lots.

164
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,870
These are not just like all the other
people that were living around Sparta who

165
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,050
the Spartans happened to make
harlots lots at an early stage.

166
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:39,300
This is a whole people with a sense of
themselves who think of themselves as

167
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:43,260
missing means they are
conquered and enslaved.

168
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,540
And they become a critical part of the
Spartan population from the standpoint of

169
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:49,680
the Spartan economy.

170
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,220
Essential for the kind of state Sparta
becomes and they are permanently

171
00:13:55,441 --> 00:13:56,550
dissatisfied.

172
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:02,270
They are permanently angry they are
permanently thinking about somehow getting

173
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:08,511
free and permanently therefore presenting
a threat to whatever the Spartan

174
00:14:09,211 --> 00:14:11,100
regime is.
At the time.

175
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,020
So that's a very very important

176
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,210
development now probably
before that happened.

177
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,900
The Spartans like some of the other states
send out colonies only to one of them

178
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:32,920
is out west.
In Southern Italy at a place called Taras.

179
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,780
That town becomes under the
Romans it becomes Trenton.

180
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:42,210
It's Toronto in modern Italy and in
the Aegean Sea the island of MI loss.

181
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:50,770
Is colonized by the Spartans and it's
so my guess is they did that as a way of

182
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:58,000
handling that population growth problem
that was beginning to be felt around

183
00:14:58,001 --> 00:15:03,001
Greece before they conquered Macedonia
and that settled their problem forever

184
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:09,390
thereafter they didn't need anymore land
they had all the land they needed to

185
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,340
feed themselves and take care of what
they needed and to be farmed by these

186
00:15:15,341 --> 00:15:19,130
captive hell lots and yet.

187
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,380
If we imagine ourselves let's say for
the sake of argument in the years six

188
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,420
seventy five.

189
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:30,250
It looks as though Sparta has certainly
not yet become the kind of a place we

190
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:32,680
will see in its full
fully developed state.

191
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,840
For instance it is still engaging in the
kinds of cultural activities that are

192
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:43,580
characteristic of the other
states which will not be true.

193
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,850
When we get to the classical period two
striking examples are in the area of

194
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,840
pottery where we find Spartan made pottery
painted pottery of the same kind of

195
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:03,410
quality but of its own unique style as
we find in the other Greek city states.

196
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:07,400
When you get to the late six and
into the 5th century that's over.

197
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,330
There isn't anything like that anymore.
And so that's a change.

198
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,360
But the other thing that's striking is
that in the period before the final or I

199
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:23,501
should say the major change in Spartan
life we here we discover poets fragments

200
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:30,221
of whose poems remain are two famous
Spartan poets of this early period to

201
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:35,260
pander and alchemist and they wrote
beautiful poetry of the same kind as the

202
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:41,651
other Greeks that will stop by the time
we get to the period we're talking about

203
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:48,580
and so the next great historical event
that makes a difference in Sparta is the

204
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,680
second messiness in war.

205
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:57,250
Which occurs in the years prep of course
where these are approximate somewhere

206
00:16:57,801 --> 00:16:59,760
between 650 and 625.

207
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,010
This happens notice in each
case first and second war.

208
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:08,900
Our guess is a whole quarter of a century
of fighting that's very important to

209
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:13,901
realize these were not your typical Greek
War of later years this is not one day

210
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,950
we have a battle and we go home.

211
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,790
This was a campaign that
lasted a generation.

212
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,890
That's how hard it was to
conquer Macedonia and then
in the second Macedonian

213
00:17:24,891 --> 00:17:25,460
war.

214
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:30,460
How hard it was to put down the tremendous
rebellion that brought about the

215
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:34,880
second scene in war.
It was a hell of rebellion.

216
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,890
The headlights could not have succeeded
in making this such a hard fight.

217
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:44,930
Had they not been assisted by
some of the neighbors of Sparta.

218
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,650
Argos you will remember from
the time of fought a fight on.

219
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:54,020
They haven't been an enemy and
a competitor of the Spartans.

220
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:59,290
And so the archives are quick to join
and help the it's in their rebellion

221
00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:05,210
against Sparta but so too do a number
of cities to the north of Sparta.

222
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,600
From the region called Arcadia also join
in with the Hellas and even so far as

223
00:18:12,771 --> 00:18:17,771
the north western corner of
the Peloponnese is a town
called Pizer near Olympia

224
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:23,680
also joins the coalition
against the Spartans.

225
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:28,780
So you can imagine that the Spartan push
forward created opposition and the hell

226
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:34,911
outs took advantage of that and join
with the other states to put Sparta in

227
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:40,700
danger. The ancient tradition says the
Spartans really were in terrible danger.

228
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,220
And it was a very very hard fight.

229
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,780
And what happened was gonna turn
out to be the first of a pattern.

230
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,500
When the hell lots were defeated
in battle they didn't quit.

231
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,700
They didn't stop fighting.

232
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:58,030
They retreated to the safest place they
could find and they're in the senior.

233
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:03,100
There is a very rugged mountain called
if soulmates to which is a kind of a

234
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:09,791
natural fortress and which the hell
that's fortified still more so that they

235
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:14,750
could stay up there on that
mountain and fight off.

236
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,810
Spartan attacks for quite a long time.

237
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,340
And remember the Spartans are hampered
in this war by having to cope with

238
00:19:22,341 --> 00:19:24,950
neighboring cities battling them as well.

239
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,190
By the time that is over.

240
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,520
You move towards the
ultimate arrangement of life.

241
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,100
In this part of that we will come to know

242
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:44,890
one set of scholars they probably are as
numerous as any would suggest that it's

243
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,400
only after the second the scene in war.

244
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,240
That the Spartan Constitution that I
will describe for you comes into being.

245
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,610
And probably we shouldn't even imagine
that it was all all the laws were laid

246
00:20:01,611 --> 00:20:06,611
out all the customs were established in
one fell swoop but rather that there was

247
00:20:07,011 --> 00:20:07,940
a basic.

248
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,250
Set of things that was laid out and then
over time other changes were made that

249
00:20:13,251 --> 00:20:18,200
produced what we're we're talking about
so that's why I think we can't accept

250
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:22,800
that traditional like Curtis story came
down step set up the laws that was that

251
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,840
even if we do accept it like Curtis
who was a kind of a law giver

252
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,553
now.

253
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,340
Before I describe it in detail let
me make a general statement about it.

254
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:38,710
What is established in this
constitutional ultimate reform.

255
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:44,370
Is to make Sparta like no other state
in the Greek world and then perhaps well

256
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:50,100
look like hardly any other states in all
of history and to make it the subject

257
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:54,640
of attention and interest and and
usually of admiration although not always

258
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,720
throughout the millennia you find when
people know about the Greeks and they

259
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,820
know about Sparta I'm talking
about of course in the West

260
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:10,870
people philosophers and others are struck
just as Plato and Aristotle were by

261
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:15,670
certain things about the Spartan way of
life that make them take it seriously

262
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:20,671
and admire Rousseau was a great admirer
of Sparta for a variety of reasons

263
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,670
but one of the things that is I don't
want you to lose sight of is that.

264
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:32,920
Sparta becomes a slave holding states.

265
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,960
Like no other Greek state.

266
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,740
Now there was slavery all
over the ancient world.

267
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:43,420
There was no society that we know of
in the ancient world that was without

268
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:47,320
slavery. And Greece was no different. But.

269
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:52,860
In the period we're talking about there
were not very many slaves among the

270
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,830
Greek states as a whole and there was
certainly nothing like what the Spartans

271
00:21:56,831 --> 00:22:01,831
did to have such have a system of life
that allowed the Spartan citizens not to

272
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:09,460
work in order to live.
No other Greek state would have that.

273
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,450
If you want to think about Greek slavery
in the 7th century B.C. think about

274
00:22:13,451 --> 00:22:18,451
what I told you about
Hansen's reconstruction of
the development of the poles.

275
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:25,380
Think about farmers who themselves work
the fields and are assisted in their

276
00:22:26,741 --> 00:22:30,520
work in the fields by one
or two slaves that they own.

277
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,320
That's not the Spartan system.

278
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,500
The Spartan system will be Spartans
at home training constantly for their

279
00:22:38,171 --> 00:22:43,150
military purposes never working any
fields never engaging in trade or industry

280
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,490
others doing that for them.

281
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:51,510
Something that in a small way begins to
resemble slavery as we think of it in

282
00:22:53,891 --> 00:22:58,891
the antebellum south in the United States
where great armies of slaves are doing

283
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,820
all the work and where the
plantation owners the Spartans are.

284
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,430
Don't do any work at all.

285
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:15,060
But and in the south to maintain the kind
of a military aristocracy of a certain

286
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:20,530
kind. Please don't push that analogy too
far and I hope I haven't misled you by

287
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:25,240
suggesting it.
But why do is because it's you.

288
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,090
Maybe that'll help us understand
the Spartans a little bit better.

289
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,120
I remember my old colleague who taught
the history American slavery and so on.

290
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:39,510
John blasting game said to me at one
point he said when the emancipation came

291
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,570
the slaves were freed
and so were the masters.

292
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,230
And I think that's a very
perceptive thing to say.

293
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,660
They were sitting on a powder keg.

294
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:57,730
Those Southern plantation owners they
were in terror constantly that if

295
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:01,930
everything didn't go just right something
like Nat Turner's rebellion would take

296
00:24:01,931 --> 00:24:04,930
place they'd come home and find their
wives and children with their throats cut.

297
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:10,530
They were in constant terror and they had
to live a life that required all sorts

298
00:24:10,811 --> 00:24:15,130
of things that they might not have liked
to do in order to repress the slave

299
00:24:15,131 --> 00:24:19,090
population on which they relied.
And that is what I want to communicate.

300
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,120
The Spartans after the two Macedonian
wars were in constant fear I think is not

301
00:24:27,671 --> 00:24:32,671
too strong a word of hell out rebellions
which might then be assisted by

302
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:39,060
neighboring states that were jealous or
disliked the Spartans and its lucidity

303
00:24:39,281 --> 00:24:44,281
says flat out that that's what this spring
is to under an understanding Spartan

304
00:24:45,071 --> 00:24:49,720
policy and Spartan thinking it
is their fear of the headlights.

305
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:54,940
Most scholars would have accepted that
without question lately some scholars

306
00:24:54,941 --> 00:24:56,500
have come up and wanted to question it.

307
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:00,610
I must say I'm not at all persuaded
by the new interpretation.

308
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I do think to understand the Spartans
we have to comprehend the continuing

309
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:11,790
permanent concern about the headlights
as we'll make clear as we talk about some

310
00:25:13,241 --> 00:25:16,610
of the details of their lives.
All right.

311
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Let's take a look now at the
way the Spartan constitution
looked fully developed

312
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:29,340
and we begin with the training
and education of the young.

313
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:35,800
The treatment of the young indeed
from the time that they are born

314
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:42,390
the the Greeks said the Spartans and
the Greeks referred to this system of

315
00:25:43,181 --> 00:25:47,010
training and education as our goal.
Gay Aji.

316
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,120
Oh gee ee
to begin with a Spartan.

317
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,810
Let's start with the men.
A Spartan boy is born already.

318
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,810
The four at the from the very beginning.

319
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,840
This is not merely a matter that concerns
his family his father and his mother.

320
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:13,620
The decision is to add that as to whether
or not he should be allowed to live.

321
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:19,830
Is made by the elders of the Spartan
community who examine the child.

322
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:26,830
What are they examining and for mainly
almost entirely for his physical

323
00:26:26,831 --> 00:26:27,664
condition.

324
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:33,180
If he is crippled if he is deformed
then any way they will have him put to

325
00:26:34,091 --> 00:26:38,530
death. The child the infant
brand new baby will be killed.

326
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:44,260
And the reason for that was that
they had a clue about eugenics.

327
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,640
They understood that

328
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:52,120
healthy children grow up to be healthy
adults who grow up to typically to have

329
00:26:52,121 --> 00:26:56,250
healthy children and vice versa.
And they could not afford.

330
00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:01,330
Was their thinking to have men grow up
who would not make good soldiers because

331
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:07,840
that's what Spartans and.
Worst of all who would then sire.

332
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,070
Boys who were not good
material for soldiers.

333
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:16,660
So there you see already something that
was totally different from any other

334
00:27:16,661 --> 00:27:21,550
Greek state. It's not that other
Greeks did not engage in infanticide.

335
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,960
They clearly did.
But they.

336
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:29,160
That decision was made by a family and
it was usually made by poor families.

337
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:34,420
I mean that the bad decision to kill a
child was made by poor families who just

338
00:27:34,421 --> 00:27:36,310
simply couldn't afford to raise the child.

339
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:42,030
But in any case it was as it would be in
almost any society you ever heard of a

340
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,650
family decision not in Sparta.

341
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,210
It was a state decision as to
whether you should live or not.

342
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,700
Well I suppose the child made
it through that first ordeal.

343
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:58,540
Now he has six years of
more or less normal life.

344
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,240
He lives at home like
any other little boy.

345
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:06,190
With his mother mostly his business
father I suppose to not so much you'll see

346
00:28:06,191 --> 00:28:10,420
why I say not so much in a bit.
And finally at the age of 7.

347
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,750
He is taken away from home.

348
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,590
Put into a word in Greek
that really that means pack.

349
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:25,590
Just like the don't it don't the Cub
Scouts call and their little groups packs.

350
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,700
Is that right. Yeah. So.

351
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,020
There they are.

352
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:36,190
And they are taken away from home and
they live in a military school which is

353
00:28:36,261 --> 00:28:39,380
the only school there
is for boys in Sparta.

354
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:45,190
Day it is that that school is governed
by a magistrate and it is run by the

355
00:28:46,521 --> 00:28:47,960
older boys.

356
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:52,820
In many respects when I think about it
it strikes me as being like an upper

357
00:28:52,821 --> 00:28:57,821
class British what they call public school
which means of course private school.

358
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:04,900
You know the descriptions of Eton and
Harrow and even more harrowing places than

359
00:29:05,031 --> 00:29:05,864
that.

360
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:12,710
I am sure you must have read novels by
Englishmen talking about their school

361
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:15,800
days and they each one sounds
like a torture chamber.

362
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:21,360
Well that's what we've got
here. But what. What one.

363
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:26,510
The worst part about those schools so
far as I could tell while the other boys.

364
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,670
Because they were allowed the older boys
were allowed to deal with younger boys

365
00:29:31,671 --> 00:29:33,950
the way older boys deal with younger boys.

366
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,443
Badly.

367
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:39,660
They are bullies they push
them around they mistreat them.

368
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,070
It's it's tough to grow
up in a place like that.

369
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,620
That was what they were up to.

370
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:50,050
Tough I think is one of the critical words
that you need to understand if you're

371
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,570
thinking about a Spartan education.

372
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:57,800
But they made it now to the age of 12.
They live in these barracks.

373
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,480
They have a communal life.

374
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:04,340
They have no nothing resembling
luxuries available to them.

375
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,880
More and more sounds like an English
public school of the 19th century.

376
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,040
They don't have shoes.

377
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,020
They are given one cloak.

378
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,460
Now whatever you may think about
the sunny Mediterranean in Greece.

379
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:22,100
Go to Sparta in the middle of the winter.

380
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,640
It's damn cold so that one cloak
isn't enough and that's intentional.

381
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:32,670
The idea is for them to
learn how to bear cold.

382
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:38,970
They are fed enough of course to keep
them healthy and going but no more not to

383
00:30:39,461 --> 00:30:40,820
satisfy their appetite.

384
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:47,040
This is meant to make them accustom
first of all make them lean and tough but

385
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:52,081
also to accustom them to the hardships
of a campaign and basically to make them

386
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:54,394
tough.

387
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,720
They therefore are constantly
on the hunt for food.

388
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:07,590
And the funny thing is that the
ethos of the situation was this that

389
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:14,960
was understood they would try
to steal whatever they could.

390
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,910
So for me to know where they would find
things to steal and how to steal it.

391
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:23,940
But kids are very ingenious so any way
they would they would be encouraged to do

392
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:27,760
that but they would be punished
severely if they were caught.

393
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,540
So it turns out the trick was
to steal but not to get caught.

394
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:37,350
That was also part of the training but
I I always thought that some wonderful

395
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,430
focus of what it was like.

396
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,880
To be a kid in one of those Spartan
schools is revealed by the story that

397
00:31:48,851 --> 00:31:50,110
Plutarch tells.

398
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:54,790
And it doesn't really matter if the
story is true or not because it tells

399
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,820
something real.
In the telling.

400
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:03,740
The story is that one Spartan boy had
succeeded in hunting an animal that he

401
00:32:05,621 --> 00:32:10,621
could eat and the other the animal he
caught was a ferret and he would have

402
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,770
killed it and eaten it.

403
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,270
Except that at just at that point the
call was for them to get into formation.

404
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,230
And so he had to immediately get into
formation would've been deadly not to do

405
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,440
that but he didn't want to lose the
ferrets so he tucked it under his cloak.

406
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:29,410
So there he is standing with the
other boys at complete attention.

407
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:34,900
Meanwhile the ferret is gradually
eating his way into the boy's side.

408
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,180
Naturally he doesn't even blink because
if he lets on that he did he will be

409
00:32:40,181 --> 00:32:44,320
severely punished for having been
being caught stealing the ferret.

410
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,450
So finally the ferret finds
its way to a vital organ.

411
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,770
And the boy without saying a word
drops dead right there in the ranks.

412
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:59,870
Now of course the point of that story
is to show how brave and how this boys

413
00:33:00,841 --> 00:33:04,920
were and how tough they were and how
rigorous was the Spartan training.

414
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,620
I always always struck by.

415
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:11,610
How hungry do you have to
be to want to eat a ferret

416
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:18,810
but however you see the story you'll see
what the messages might be exaggerated

417
00:33:18,811 --> 00:33:19,644
and all that.
But.

418
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,220
That's the picture that
comes out of Sparta

419
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:29,910
now they are also in addition they have
given physical training they're already

420
00:33:29,981 --> 00:33:34,420
beginning to get physical training the
use of weapons formations and so on.

421
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:40,900
But at the same time they are taught what
the Greeks call I think I mentioned in

422
00:33:40,901 --> 00:33:44,890
an earlier talk music.
Hey music.

423
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:49,840
Music What we call the translation
is music but. It means poetry.

424
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:55,470
It means poems that are accompanied by
musical instruments and sung but the

425
00:33:57,101 --> 00:34:01,090
words are what matter
more than anything else.

426
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:06,660
And what the kind of things that they
are taught are moral lessons that are

427
00:34:09,821 --> 00:34:14,821
meant to be the things that they live
by that they are raised by and in a few

428
00:34:16,211 --> 00:34:20,920
moments I'll read to you an example of
the kind of thing that was part of that

429
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,960
musical training of course gymnastics
and military training I mentioned before

430
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:31,710
the boys until the age of 20 are trained
by older boys or I should say young men

431
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,010
between the ages of 20 and 30.

432
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:42,030
So this this educational element will
consist of boys from the age of seven to

433
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,760
men at the age of 30.

434
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:50,470
But the guys between 20 and 30 will be
the teachers and the boys below them will

435
00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:51,520
be their pupils.

436
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:57,870
Now other elements involved in this
picture there was as you will find always

437
00:34:58,631 --> 00:35:03,310
fine in system where boys are packed
together and there are older and younger

438
00:35:03,311 --> 00:35:04,120
boys.

439
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:09,120
Hazing is part of this game all part of
the business of being tough and manly

440
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:10,600
and so on and so forth.

441
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,010
But the Spartans know that wasn't enough.

442
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:20,680
As we will see what they are shooting
for is not developing not merely

443
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:25,780
developing individuals who have
the qualities that are desired.

444
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:31,740
They are interested in developing
people young men who are so closely

445
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:37,720
intertwined with each
other as to be tighter.

446
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,120
Even I would argue than a family.

447
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:45,370
And one aspect of this
was very clearly sexual.

448
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:51,660
The typical arrangement was a young
teenage boy would be associated with an

449
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:57,570
older man but could be one of the men
between the ages of 20 and 30 it could be

450
00:35:59,021 --> 00:36:01,870
an older man and they
had a formal arrangement.

451
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:07,120
The older man was what the Greeks
called an arrow rotates a lover.

452
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:12,670
And the boy was the Roman us.
And that means the beloved.

453
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:18,700
Xenophon who is an Athenian but who spent
a good deal of his life in Sparta and

454
00:36:18,701 --> 00:36:19,960
knew the Spartans very well.

455
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:25,330
It is very very eager to tell us that
there was no physical side to this

456
00:36:27,161 --> 00:36:32,161
association that it was purely spiritual
and it was between teacher and pupil

457
00:36:32,651 --> 00:36:37,010
between mentor and the boy that
he provides mentorship for.

458
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:41,200
But that's all but.
Forget it.

459
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:46,470
I mean this was very much these were
homosexual relationships but it's the

460
00:36:47,441 --> 00:36:52,441
Xstrata thing to remember is this was
a phase a passing phase that is this

461
00:36:53,871 --> 00:36:57,390
relationship started when one
was a boy and one was a man.

462
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:03,490
And when the boy reached manhood
himself then he was no longer in that

463
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:08,801
relationship and he himself could become
an arrow Chase and find himself and

464
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:14,490
Roman us although it would be very
surprising if he didn't continue to have a

465
00:37:14,751 --> 00:37:19,520
very close friendship and association
with the older man who had been his

466
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:24,850
rotates and the other thing every Spartan.

467
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,900
Went on thereafter and I'll come
to it in a minute was married.

468
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,350
And was supposed to produce children.

469
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:39,100
Most Desirable be male children who would
serve as soldiers for them so I think

470
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:46,060
we should think of this as being all
part of a state system of training and

471
00:37:46,061 --> 00:37:51,061
education to produce fighting
men who would also be

472
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,280
practically all a single family as
close and tight with one another as they

473
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:04,401
could be because of the quality it would
give to the Spartan phalanx made up of

474
00:38:06,811 --> 00:38:07,980
such men.

475
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,520
I was gonna say the the.

476
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:19,830
Spartan man when he reaches 20 the guys
that were there between the ages of 20

477
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:23,990
or 30 are.
Allowed to marry.

478
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,680
But they are not allowed
to live with their wives.

479
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,760
They continue to live in the barracks.

480
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:38,040
Talk about strange and
peculiar arrangements on the
other hand of course they

481
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:44,161
had a natural desire to visit their
wives which they could do if they weren't

482
00:38:46,061 --> 00:38:51,061
caught so you had to sneak
away to be with your wife.

483
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,810
But if you were caught you were punished.
Now.

484
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,270
What's that all about.

485
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:03,510
Well it's it shows you that one of the
main many conflicts that exist in the

486
00:39:04,461 --> 00:39:09,461
spartan system on the one hand you have
to do that because you need children but

487
00:39:10,451 --> 00:39:13,990
to perpetuate Spartans but
also to provide soldiers.

488
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:17,350
So you have to have that
much normality in the system.

489
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,630
On the other hand you want to resist as
much as you can building a family in the

490
00:39:22,631 --> 00:39:27,631
traditional sense because loyalty to
the family might be in conflict with

491
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:32,950
loyalty to the polls and
the Post wins that argument.

492
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:36,370
Because the separation takes place.

493
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:39,760
I don't know whether the
Spartans understood this or
not but it seems to me is a

494
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:40,690
psychologically

495
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,400
element in here that might even have
physical consequences for all I know.

496
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:50,700
I'm thinking about imagine what it was
like when a wife and a young husband and

497
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:55,330
a wife actually got
together all that time.

498
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,560
I mean there's an argument
for quality as being.

499
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:04,370
At the opposite end of
quantity never mind.

500
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:13,990
In any case those are some of the
strange arrangements that were now.

501
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:18,260
But when the man gets to be 30 he stops
being an instructor in the school.

502
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,970
Now he has his own home.

503
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:24,740
He lives at home with his wife and if
he has young children but below 7 they'd

504
00:40:24,741 --> 00:40:29,360
be there. And the situation
looks more normal except.

505
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,403
That.

506
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:36,040
These Spartans men did
not eat dinner at home.

507
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,970
They had their meals
together at a common mess.

508
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:46,450
Each one of which was called a society
on then that word really means having

509
00:40:48,111 --> 00:40:50,690
food having grain having bread together.

510
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:56,030
And there were 15 men to
each one of these sit here.

511
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:01,640
This mess and they together had their
meals together for the rest of their

512
00:41:01,641 --> 00:41:02,474
lives.

513
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:07,990
There again you have a sense of tremendous
community building unit building.

514
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,820
What is that about the
size of a platoon isn't it.

515
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:15,920
Or is it a squad squad
the size of a squad.

516
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,280
Everything in this thing is military.
Now think about.

517
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:24,730
Think about the kind of a loyalty to
one another which we have learned is so

518
00:41:24,921 --> 00:41:27,050
critical to success in warfare.

519
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:32,750
That came from people who have come
through that system and were fighting as

520
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:37,751
they did right next to the guys
that they saw every day at meals.

521
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,580
So that was part of that game.

522
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:46,690
So even when they're grown men and
living at home they are still maintaining

523
00:41:46,941 --> 00:41:47,774
their.

524
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:53,110
Close quayside familial association
with their fellow fighting men.

525
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:59,060
What are the qualities that are
supposed to be produced by this system.

526
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:05,660
Discipline first and foremost every aspect
of your life is governed by the laws

527
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,780
and the customs of the community.
You better conform.

528
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:15,170
There is nothing else for
you self-reliance strangely
enough because all of

529
00:42:15,641 --> 00:42:20,641
these encouragements to
theft and discouragement to
getting caught have to do

530
00:42:22,091 --> 00:42:27,091
with building the ability to do things
like that social cohesion who can imagine

531
00:42:27,251 --> 00:42:31,300
a system more constructed
to bring about such a goal.

532
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:35,890
Loyalty to one another whatever
group you are talking about.

533
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:41,310
But of course beyond that loyalty to the
community at large is implicit in all

534
00:42:42,671 --> 00:42:46,300
of that obedience to your superiors.

535
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,970
Physical and moral endurance

536
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,930
courage and another
quality that is important.

537
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,240
And again something that appealed very
powerfully to other Greeks uniformity.

538
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:06,840
You are all just like one another.

539
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,960
You go through exactly
the same experiences.

540
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:15,180
There is no distinction among you on the
other hand and this is what is another

541
00:43:15,181 --> 00:43:19,470
one of the so interesting
contradictions about the Spartan system.

542
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:25,050
Every one of those boys and then
young men and then older men.

543
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,210
Is in competition for honor.

544
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:35,260
Every one of them wants to be recognized
by himself by his peers and by his

545
00:43:35,661 --> 00:43:39,290
superiors as having been
better than the others.

546
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:44,470
The best if possible all of them in
this situation of being friends being

547
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:52,541
associates being close pals being all
those things being part of a unit and yet

548
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:57,820
competing within that group for personal
recognition and honor and that is a

549
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:04,370
contradiction.
And it's a very interesting kind of tug.

550
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:05,920
I think you know this.

551
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,250
You have to understand that the Spartans
are are living in a condition of

552
00:44:10,251 --> 00:44:11,300
strain.

553
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:16,900
It seems to me much greater than most
societies impose on people but it's

554
00:44:17,331 --> 00:44:20,900
obviously arranged so
effectively that it works.

555
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,960
You don't have we don't have an evidence
of sort of mass insanity or a great

556
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,980
need for psychiatrists
or anything like that.

557
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:34,930
If it was an insane society they
were all insane in the same way.

558
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:40,160
And they didn't know it. And I think
that we have to face that fact.

559
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:46,070
This is this business of
sameness I think is important.

560
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:51,460
They referred to one another they were
referred to the men who were had grown to

561
00:44:51,651 --> 00:44:54,920
become full citizens were called Homeboy.

562
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,400
Sometimes people translate that
equals that no that's not right.

563
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:03,520
It is similar as they
are all like one another.

564
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,040
I think it would have been they wouldn't
have called themselves equals because

565
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:11,750
there was this constant sense that they
are vying to be the best even as they

566
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:13,670
are so similar to one another.

567
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:19,550
The legend has it that when like Kirkus
established the system he divided all of

568
00:45:20,661 --> 00:45:24,980
the land controlled by
the Spartans into 9000.

569
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:27,830
Patches of land.

570
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,510
The Greek word is clear
ROI singular as Clay Ross.

571
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:37,880
That was the theoretical thing again.
They were all in this case.

572
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:42,800
They were all equal in their
economic resources because
each one had a Clay Ross.

573
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:48,430
Whose food the product of that
Clay Ross was his to deal with.

574
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:52,490
And of course that amount
that was essentially we're
talking about food that was

575
00:45:52,491 --> 00:45:54,890
being produced on that Clay Ross.

576
00:45:56,150 --> 00:46:01,150
So in theory there's all of this
similarity and Quasar equality but age was

577
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:06,290
another important distinction
among the Spartans.

578
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:10,970
As is true in most primitive societies
and the old of the society I think the

579
00:46:10,971 --> 00:46:15,971
truer it is age is given tremendous
respect just by being older than somebody

580
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:23,950
you are treated as in some sense
better than a younger person.

581
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:28,573
But.

582
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:34,210
It wasn't pure age because it's also
true that the Honor did you had gain in

583
00:46:35,901 --> 00:46:38,030
your life.
Would also.

584
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,680
Produce respect and in proportion to how
great had been your contribution to the

585
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:50,510
state. I don't think they had
formal ways of indicating that.

586
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,480
I don't think it's a question
of medals or anything like that.

587
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:58,010
Everybody knew in a state of this size.

588
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:02,030
Everybody knew who was who
and treated them accordingly.

589
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:08,230
Now.
There were also over time.

590
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:14,220
There grew up to be inequalities not
only of age and of honor but also of

591
00:47:14,591 --> 00:47:15,424
wealth.

592
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:20,640
It's a little bit hard to know how all
this came about but at different times in

593
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:26,190
Spartan history you see there are people
who have managed to lose their Clay

594
00:47:26,651 --> 00:47:27,484
Ross.

595
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,040
And when you don't have a Clay Ross you
don't have the necessary wherewithal to

596
00:47:34,141 --> 00:47:39,141
make your contribution to the society
on the mess at which you all dine.

597
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:45,650
And when that happens you have dropped
out of the Spartan citizen body.

598
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,160
You are no longer a Sparta.

599
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:54,770
You are something lesser and that is a
very tough kind of thing for a man to

600
00:47:56,371 --> 00:48:00,190
have to live in as a Spartan.

601
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,093
Now.

602
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,010
Before I get to the
whole hang on a second.

603
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:10,840
So poverty.

604
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:16,650
Could keep you out of the system and if
for any reason you had not gone through

605
00:48:19,301 --> 00:48:24,301
the algo gay from beginning to end
you were not a regular full Spartan.

606
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:31,620
Also if anybody had been
declared to be cowardly.

607
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:37,260
In fighting in the war that person could
be stricken from the rolls of Spartan

608
00:48:38,171 --> 00:48:40,360
citizens and yet they
had no place else to go.

609
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:45,780
And so as we will see they lived a
rather wretched life in Sparta after that

610
00:48:47,231 --> 00:48:52,231
situation similarly if people were
thought not to be the children of two

611
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:56,670
Spartans.

612
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:02,150
Spartan father Spartan mother
then they were not Sparta gates.

613
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:08,120
They held a and inferior place in that
society and in this society so riddled

614
00:49:10,021 --> 00:49:12,720
with issues of honor and respect.

615
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,390
You can imagine that was a very big deal.

616
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:18,900
Keep that in the back of your mind
because as we move on the course and as we

617
00:49:18,901 --> 00:49:23,901
get into the fifth century especially
we will be running into Spartans who fit

618
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:29,120
these categories who are not 100 percent
Spartans and yet some of them become

619
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:36,080
tremendously important and
powerful figures in Sparta
and we'll want to ask how

620
00:49:37,201 --> 00:49:37,740
that happened.

621
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:42,120
But even more will want to ask how that
shaped the way they behaved once they

622
00:49:42,121 --> 00:49:47,121
became important people now up to now
I've been talking about men but it's

623
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:53,551
important to talk about Spartan women too
because they were different from other

624
00:49:55,091 --> 00:49:58,090
Greek women just as
the men were different.

625
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:03,040
I just.
Just to make that clear.

626
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:07,320
Let me make it plain that the rest
of the Greeks treated women very very

627
00:50:07,321 --> 00:50:08,910
differently from men.

628
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:14,750
And one thing that was very striking and
the difference was that the men engaged

629
00:50:15,991 --> 00:50:20,991
in physical exercise and these especially
in these competitions that were part

630
00:50:21,001 --> 00:50:26,001
of the great games and those were always
carried out in the nude women did not

631
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:33,920
engage in these sports activities and
if it would have been that great the

632
00:50:34,861 --> 00:50:39,861
greatest conceivable shame for a woman
to be seen in the nude it was just

633
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:43,590
absolutely unthinkable
for the ordinary Greeks.

634
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,740
But the Spartans do things their own way.

635
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:53,180
And their women engage in dancing and
athletics and in competition and they did

636
00:50:57,901 --> 00:51:02,901
so in the nude just as the boys did and
so they were not shut away from the boys

637
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:12,080
all the time in the way that Greek
girls were kept away from the boys.

638
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:17,590
I don't mean to say they were allowed to
mingle socially but that is to say that

639
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:23,040
if the boys were exercising here the
girls might be exercising their someplace

640
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:26,430
else they would not be kept
so far apart from one another.

641
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:31,970
And I again think about all this all
of the things that normal human desires

642
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,560
think about it that that would get

643
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:41,450
excited in this kind of stuff that I've
been describing and yet they would never

644
00:51:41,461 --> 00:51:44,840
have a crack at them until
they got to be 20 years old.

645
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:51,550
It all reminds me of a wonderful footnote
in a book about English history from

646
00:51:52,321 --> 00:51:56,160
1914 to forty five by a J.P.

647
00:51:56,161 --> 00:51:59,490
Taylor as some of the best
stuff is in his footnotes.

648
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:03,000
And this one says he was telling about.

649
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,273
The

650
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:10,350
the drop of the birth rate in Egypt.

651
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,800
Sorry England late 19th early 20th
century which he says was did was not

652
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:23,700
accompanied by a growth of knowledge
of or use of contraceptive devices.

653
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,290
And he concludes.

654
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:30,120
Anybody who studies England in this
period must deal must realize that he is

655
00:52:30,121 --> 00:52:33,150
dealing with a deeply frustrated people.

656
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:38,580
Well if that's true of the British I mean
think of what life in Sparta was like

657
00:52:38,581 --> 00:52:40,140
for a young man and young woman.

658
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,940
So on the one hand you have.

659
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:55,570
Women who are treated more like men in
Sparta than in other places and indeed

660
00:52:58,221 --> 00:53:02,720
they even had greater legal rights
than they did in other states.

661
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:07,970
And I think all of that.
Kind of has.

662
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:14,520
Plays a part in the notion of degrading
the family as it is usually understood

663
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,690
in the Greek world and
elevating the notion of

664
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:26,360
a male dominated a male centered society
for the purpose of producing warriors.

665
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:33,670
Why are the women given this special
status because of the recognition that

666
00:53:33,671 --> 00:53:38,530
women play a critical role in
producing the same kinds of warriors.

667
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:40,630
And that's what they're about.

668
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:47,800
One aspect of this to show you that it's
all for the Poles and it's all for the

669
00:53:47,801 --> 00:53:51,010
business of producing good fighting men.

670
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:55,930
There were actually in a sense
group rights with the women.

671
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:00,460
For instance if a man found that his wife.

672
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:01,720
Couldn't bear children.

673
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:08,050
It was legal and proper and normal for
a man who was his friend to lend him his

674
00:54:12,021 --> 00:54:17,021
wife and that the child who came from
that union would belong to the man who had

675
00:54:19,421 --> 00:54:20,890
been childless.

676
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:26,280
Again I think I mean what is happening
to all the normal feelings about that

677
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:28,000
people have for one another.

678
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:32,800
And the central role that family plays
in almost every society you can think of.

679
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:39,130
So but on the other hand we
could not we should not imagine.

680
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:45,240
That women had a role in Spartan society
that was anything equal to them and

681
00:54:46,541 --> 00:54:48,670
they would like in every
other part of the Greek world.

682
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:52,000
The women were excluded from
political life entirely.

683
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:54,430
And yet there are.

684
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:57,850
Well they kept it is
almost conflicting stuff.

685
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:01,900
Let me tell you the next thing I want
to tell you about the marriage ceremony.

686
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:03,543
In Sparta.

687
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:07,120
Shows you a very odd kind of a thing.

688
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,730
First of all it happened.

689
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:14,920
These are all ritual activities but you
ritually seize the girl you're going to

690
00:55:15,431 --> 00:55:16,264
marry her.

691
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:21,100
It's as though you're you're saying that
the fundamental basic way you'll find a

692
00:55:21,101 --> 00:55:25,890
family is you grab a woman
and she becomes yours.

693
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:30,530
Then this the marriage ceremony itself.

694
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:34,150
Girl has her head shaved.

695
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:37,360
And she is dressed as a man.

696
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:43,100
And sits in a darkened
room awaiting her groom.

697
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:50,030
And it seems to me that they're
trying to make her as much like a boy.

698
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:53,220
As they possibly can.

699
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:58,240
At this moment the conservation
of the marriage for the first time

700
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,500
well whatever my interpretation.

701
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:06,910
You've got to accept the weirdness of
the world that I have been describing to

702
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:08,034
you.

703
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:13,910
Well all of this you know had this
interesting impact the one other thing I

704
00:56:14,111 --> 00:56:18,760
haven't told you that my last thing I
wanna say about women that went on when a

705
00:56:18,761 --> 00:56:20,200
Spartan woman was a mother.

706
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:26,200
She was Pericles in his funeral oration
ends the humiliation to say now as to

707
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:29,620
the wives and mothers of these
great men who have just died.

708
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:33,520
Just shut up and go home.
Because.

709
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:39,290
The highest thing that can be said about
a woman is that she is never spoken of

710
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:44,230
for good or for ill. This is
democratic Athens we're talking about.

711
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:50,040
Well nobody ever told a Spartan mother
or to shut her mouth because Greek

712
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:53,830
literature is filled with
quotations from Spartan mothers

713
00:56:55,420 --> 00:57:00,420
telling people stuff like telling their
son to go out to battle and come back

714
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,200
with your shield or on it.

715
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:09,220
You know that these shields were
like they were you could use them as.

716
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:13,030
What do you take bodies
out with no stretchers.

717
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:17,980
And so her message was you come back if
I heard you through your shield away and

718
00:57:17,981 --> 00:57:21,880
ran don't come home.
And there are all kinds of tales.

719
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:27,300
So Spartan women obviously give me one
other one time late in their history when

720
00:57:27,431 --> 00:57:32,350
things are going bad for the Spartans a
hostile army actually gets into Sparta

721
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:37,710
and the women are up there on the roofs
of their houses throwing roof tiles.

722
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:41,680
As projectiles against the enemy army.

723
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:45,190
So Spartan women were
really something else.

724
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:51,120
And there they are but if you
take the whole picture what is it.

725
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:56,530
It is as I say the degradation of the
family in favor of the importance of the

726
00:57:57,651 --> 00:58:01,220
polis as a whole its needs and its.

727
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:02,923
Structure.

728
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,130
It is a warrior ethic.

729
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:12,110
It is based upon the principle
of the Hop light failings.

730
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:17,500
And I want to read to you a piece of
poetry written by the Spartan poet T.S.

731
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:23,860
was dated somewhere in the 7th century
that gets at a number of the topics I've

732
00:58:24,651 --> 00:58:28,760
been talking about so far.
Here's how it goes.

733
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:35,380
I would not say anything for a man nor
take account of him for any speed of his

734
00:58:36,291 --> 00:58:41,291
feet or wrestling skill he might have
not if he had the size of a Cyclops and

735
00:58:41,661 --> 00:58:46,661
the strength to go with it not if he could
outrun Boris the north wind not if he

736
00:58:48,241 --> 00:58:53,241
were more handsome and gracefully formed
than to owners or had more riches than

737
00:58:54,151 --> 00:58:55,010
Midas had.

738
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,810
Or can I was to.

739
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:02,370
Not if he were more of a
king than tantalum peel or
has the power of speech and

740
00:59:02,371 --> 00:59:04,180
persuasion that address does.

741
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:09,650
That is a catalogue of all the things
that people admire and want for themselves

742
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:15,430
and regard as important in Homer.
Everything.

743
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:19,230
Those are the characteristics that every
hero wants and he says I don't give a

744
00:59:19,231 --> 00:59:20,520
damn for all that.

745
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:24,720
Says 30 is for no man.

746
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:29,550
I'm sorry I skipped an important line.
I don't care about any of those things.

747
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:34,620
Not if he had all splinters except for
a fighting spirit for no man ever proves

748
00:59:38,531 --> 00:59:43,531
himself a good man in war unless he
can endure to face the blood and the

749
00:59:43,961 --> 00:59:48,961
slaughter to go close against the
enemy and fight with his hands.

750
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:55,410
Here is our red tape which my translator
translates courage which is fair.

751
00:59:56,740 --> 01:00:00,450
That's the most fundamental meaning of it.
But anyway it is the word retain.

752
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,310
Mankind's finest possession.

753
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:09,030
Here is the Nobel Peace Prize that a
young man can endeavour to win and it is a

754
01:00:09,041 --> 01:00:11,560
good thing his city and all
the people share with him.

755
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:17,310
When a man plants his feet and
stands firm among the foremost Spears

756
01:00:17,861 --> 01:00:22,861
relentlessly all sort of falls
like completely forgotten
and as well trained his

757
01:00:25,391 --> 01:00:30,391
heart to be steadfast and endure and
with words encourages the man who is

758
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:32,840
stationed beside him.

759
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:38,770
Here is a man who proves himself
valiant in war with a sudden rush.

760
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:44,840
He turns to fight the rugged battalions
of the enemy and sustains the beating

761
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:45,674
wave of assault.

762
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:50,030
I don't care about any of those things
that you read about the Iliad The Odyssey.

763
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:54,230
All I care about is how do you
fight when you're in the Félix.

764
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,920
And if you don't have
it there you're nothing.

765
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:00,883
To continue.

766
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:05,120
He's not going to reexamine the
question of what happens if you die.

767
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,350
I mean that that happens doesn't it.

768
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:13,590
Here's what he says and he who so falls
among the champions and loses his sweet

769
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:17,590
life.
Notice that I want to touch that.

770
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:21,460
Here he is tell he's going to tell you
in a moment how good it is to die in this

771
01:01:21,461 --> 01:01:25,630
way. But he's not kidding himself.
Life is sweet. You've lost it.

772
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,420
Here's that wonderful Greek real
realism that I told you about.

773
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:31,120
And loses his sweet life.

774
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:36,150
So blessing with honor his Polis his
father and all his people with wounds in

775
01:01:38,141 --> 01:01:39,010
his chest.

776
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:44,880
Where the spear that he was facing has
transfixed the massive guard of his

777
01:01:45,431 --> 01:01:49,240
shield and gone through
his breastplate as well.

778
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:55,200
Why such a man is lamented the like by
the young and the elders and all his city

779
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:59,680
goes into mourning and
grieves for his loss.

780
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:05,340
His tomb is pointed to with pride.
And so are his children.

781
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:07,770
And his children's children.

782
01:02:08,490 --> 01:02:13,490
And afterward all the race that is his
his shining glory is never forgotten.

783
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:19,330
His name is remembered and
he becomes an immortal.

784
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,020
So he lies under the ground.

785
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:27,860
When one who was a brave man has been
killed by the furious war God standing his

786
01:02:28,051 --> 01:02:31,740
ground and fighting hard for
his children and his land.

787
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:36,210
I hope you noticed all of the things we've
been talking about that are contained

788
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:37,433
in that statement.

789
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,610
All of those are reasons why you should
be willing to risk your life for your

790
01:02:41,611 --> 01:02:46,611
policy because thereby you
can win yourself immortality
of one of the few ways

791
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:51,560
that you can do that as a Greek.
OK.

792
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:55,050
But he there is another
said what if things go well.

793
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:57,230
What if you don't get killed.

794
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:03,010
But if he escapes the doom of that death
the destroyer of bodies and wins his

795
01:03:03,011 --> 01:03:03,844
battle.

796
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:09,060
And bright renown for the work of his
spear all men give place to him like.

797
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:15,810
The youth and the elders and much joy
comes his way before he goes down to the

798
01:03:17,351 --> 01:03:18,184
dead.

799
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:19,563
Aging.

800
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:24,740
He has reputation among his citizens no
one tries to interfere with his honours

801
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,890
or all he deserves.

802
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:32,940
All men withdraw before his presence and
yield their seats to him the youth and

803
01:03:34,481 --> 01:03:37,570
the men his age and even
those older than he.

804
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:43,470
Thus a man should endeavour to reach
this high plain place of courage with all

805
01:03:43,961 --> 01:03:48,040
his heart and so trying
never be backward in war.

806
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:53,760
So it pays off for you to be brave and a
good soldier in the Phalanx whether you

807
01:03:53,891 --> 01:03:57,310
live or die.
Both of them are good ends.

808
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:01,390
And notice how slyly he makes the point
about even if things go well for you

809
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:02,590
before you die.

810
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:05,470
Meaning don't imagine if you don't get
killed in this battle you're going to

811
01:04:05,471 --> 01:04:07,490
live forever.
You're going to die anyway.

812
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:14,250
Now there was yet another element in
and by the way dirtiest witnesses songs

813
01:04:15,131 --> 01:04:18,820
would have been the songs that the boys
would have been learned when but it

814
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:23,620
would have been taught in school and they
would have been marching along to the

815
01:04:23,621 --> 01:04:25,510
music of that poem.

816
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:32,310
But then Xenophon who wrote late in the
5th early fourth centuries an Athenian

817
01:04:32,991 --> 01:04:37,780
and knew the Spartans well as I say tells
us about how the Spartans dealt with

818
01:04:37,781 --> 01:04:42,781
this problem of instilling courage in
their soldiers and the avoiding the

819
01:04:45,011 --> 01:04:45,460
opposite.

820
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:50,270
Here's what he says in other
states when a man proves a coward.

821
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,710
The only consequence is
that he is called a coward.

822
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:59,080
He goes to the same market as the
brave man and sits beside him.

823
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:01,300
He attends the same gymnasium.

824
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:06,330
If he chooses but in Sparta everyone
would be ashamed to have a coward with him

825
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:12,680
at the mess or to be matched
with him in a wrestling bout.

826
01:05:13,490 --> 01:05:18,490
Often when sides are picked for a game
of ball he is the odd man left out.

827
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:24,110
In a chorus he is banished
to the ignominious place.

828
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:28,190
In the streets he is bound to
make way when he occupies a seat.

829
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:31,610
He must needs give it up
even to a younger man.

830
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:37,390
He must support.
Get this his spinster relatives at home.

831
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:43,270
And he must explain to them why they
are old maids nobody is gonna marry the

832
01:05:45,581 --> 01:05:49,990
sister of a coward and think of the joy.
Of.

833
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:55,890
Meeting your sister at home every day as
she looks at you and realizes she's not

834
01:05:56,441 --> 01:05:58,180
going to have a husband because of you.

835
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:04,740
He must make the best of
a fireside without a wife
because who would marry such

836
01:06:04,741 --> 01:06:08,070
a man and yet pay forfeit for that.

837
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,650
He may not stroll about with a cheerful
countenance if he walks around with a

838
01:06:13,651 --> 01:06:16,110
smile on his face.
Somebody is going to knock it off.

839
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:21,450
Nor behave as though he were a man of
unsullied fame or else he must submit to

840
01:06:21,451 --> 01:06:25,780
be beaten by his betters.
Small wonder I think.

841
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:30,820
Says Xenophon that where such a load
of dishonor is laid on the coward death

842
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:36,880
seems preferable to a life
so dishonored so ignominious.

843
01:06:38,090 --> 01:06:41,180
Now the truth is I think
Xenophon is exaggerating.

844
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:46,540
I don't think it would be fun to come
home after behaving like a coward.

845
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:49,310
In any Greek city.

846
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:54,970
But I do think it's fair to say that
it would have been intolerable when if

847
01:06:56,450 --> 01:06:58,280
you're talking about Sparta.

848
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:02,173
Yeah we have some time.

849
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:07,310
Let me turn now to the more
formal constitution of the
state as we would use the

850
01:07:08,251 --> 01:07:11,760
term today.
It is

851
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:15,960
unique in Greek life.

852
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:21,820
It is a mixed constitution. It is
not a Democrat it is not a democracy.

853
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:25,800
It's not a monarchy. It's not an
oligarchy. It's not an aristocracy.

854
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:31,040
It contains elements of every one
of those more normal constitutions.

855
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:33,360
There are kings.

856
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:39,680
Notice I say plural because there are
two kings at any one time each descending

857
01:07:39,691 --> 01:07:41,730
from a different royal family.

858
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:46,140
These kings have priestly
responsibilities they serve.

859
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:50,850
And this is very important as
generals who lead the Spartan army.

860
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:54,780
They are judges in all sorts of cases.

861
01:07:55,590 --> 01:07:59,730
At any gathering of a public
nature they hold a seat of honor.

862
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:03,940
At banquets.
They get a double portion.

863
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:07,770
I don't think we should understand that
to mean that you get very big fat kings

864
01:08:07,771 --> 01:08:09,390
so we twice as much as anybody else.

865
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:14,870
I think what this gives
them an opportunity to share
that with their friends and

866
01:08:14,941 --> 01:08:17,880
to hand out honors and
to be thanked for that

867
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:23,910
when the Spartans appoint somebody to be
their representative in another state.

868
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:26,340
That's their form of diplomatic relations.

869
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:31,770
The man who appoints
the the the proxy in us.

870
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:36,950
That's the Greek word is that the Kings
make that appointment when the Spartans

871
01:08:38,431 --> 01:08:40,560
have to consult the death Delphic oracle.

872
01:08:41,790 --> 01:08:46,170
Men called the pithy oi are the ones who
are sent to make the enquiry and bring

873
01:08:46,171 --> 01:08:48,960
back the answer.
The Kings select them.

874
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:54,620
Well these are of course enormously
honorific activities so the Kings are in a

875
01:08:56,761 --> 01:09:01,761
position to hand out very important
honours to their fellow Spartans.

876
01:09:02,970 --> 01:09:06,400
And that I think is another one of
the important privileges they have.

877
01:09:07,290 --> 01:09:12,290
If there is an heiress who
does not have a husband.

878
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:19,560
This could be typically a woman whose
husband has died and now she needs to be

879
01:09:20,021 --> 01:09:22,180
married to somebody else.
That.

880
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:25,920
Assignment is made by the Kings.

881
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,600
They tell that woman whom
she is going to marry.

882
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:33,280
The reason being behind that is that she
carries now because she has no brothers

883
01:09:33,281 --> 01:09:38,281
no uncles who could inherit her father's
Clay Ross and other wealth that now

884
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:43,690
goes with her. She has to be assigned to
somebody on behalf of the Spartan state.

885
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:50,010
Likewise if there are
adoptions of children from one
family to another it is the

886
01:09:50,741 --> 01:09:52,780
kings who make these decisions.

887
01:09:53,650 --> 01:09:58,650
The Kings also sit on the council that
is the dominant advisory consulting

888
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:03,710
element in the whole Spartan state.
It is called the Guru S.R.

889
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:09,300
which would be translated into Latin as
sonata to us our words Senate it is a

890
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:14,371
council of elders it consists of twenty
eight men over the age of 60 who are

891
01:10:18,401 --> 01:10:23,401
elected by the Spartans and the two kings
who sit with them to produce a council

892
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:25,960
of thirty.

893
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:33,070
The kingship is hereditary in each line.

894
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:38,650
With this little bump in it that is it's
not necessarily the first son of the

895
01:10:38,771 --> 01:10:43,360
previous king. It's the first son
born after the king has become king.

896
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:47,110
So if there's any question about
that that's the determining element.

897
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:54,790
The Kings are the only Spartans who are
not required to go through the Argo gay.

898
01:10:55,730 --> 01:10:59,540
I think the idea was it would be demeaning
for the royal figure to have to be

899
01:10:59,541 --> 01:11:03,590
beaten up by older boys.
That's probably what's behind it.

900
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:11,480
On the other hand I think we should be
aware that these are. Even less than that.

901
01:11:11,610 --> 01:11:13,160
Remember we spoke of the Greek.

902
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:18,880
Bacillus in early days as perhaps having
some kind of a royal function but never

903
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:19,803
a real one.

904
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:23,590
Well the Spartans have the power the
Spartan kings have the powers I've just

905
01:11:23,591 --> 01:11:28,591
described but another thing that reduces
their kingly character is that there

906
01:11:30,191 --> 01:11:31,024
are two of them.

907
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:37,010
That means one can always veto the other
and that means they never can have the

908
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:42,630
kind of power that a true
king in our sense would have.

909
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,800
One other thing is that two other
things one is that the Garrow C.R.

910
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:52,070
this council of elders has very important
powers and some and some of them

911
01:11:53,261 --> 01:11:54,280
relating to the Kings.

912
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:58,560
There is another group of Spartans
another council and annual accounts.

913
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:00,090
I should've told you that the galaxy.

914
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:05,250
Once the men are chosen they serve for
life but there is another council in

915
01:12:05,251 --> 01:12:10,251
Sparta of men five of them called F wars
and these f wars are ordinary Spartans

916
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:18,390
who come from the just from any anybody
who is a Spartan one of the powers they

917
01:12:18,391 --> 01:12:23,391
have is of the Kings is they can bring
charges against the Kings if they believe

918
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:28,770
that the either of the Kings has done
wrong violated the law done something

919
01:12:28,771 --> 01:12:33,771
improper and then the Kings
are tried by the group seal

920
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:41,250
and then if you think that's just a pro
forma activity the Spartan history is

921
01:12:42,431 --> 01:12:47,431
filled with kings who have been convicted
of some crime or other and are driven

922
01:12:48,461 --> 01:12:52,210
off into exile and
removed from the kingship.

923
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:55,300
So these are very powerful limitations.

924
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:00,580
I think I'm out of time so I'll I'll
start next time by completing our

925
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:05,010
discussion of the Spartan state
and move forward from there.
