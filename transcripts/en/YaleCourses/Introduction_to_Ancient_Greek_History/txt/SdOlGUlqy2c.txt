Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Our topic today is the dark ages and the world of homer. And of course you have, uh, as one of your reading assignments of problem that deals precisely with that question that asks the subordinate questions. Uh, was there a world, a real world that Homer's poems refer to? If so, what world was it? Was it the world of the Mycenaean Bronze Age? Was it the world that succeeded that Bronze Age that we call the dark ages? Was it, uh, the world in which we tradition says homer himself lived that we think of as the transition to the classical, well, first of the archaic and into the classical period. It's a period in which we think about the dawn of the Polis. Uh, that that really is the question we are wrestling with. And of course I'd behind it all is the idea, can we seek any historical information from his Po Homer's poems at all?

Speaker 1:          00:01:11       It would be a terrible blow to me and everybody else in the field if the answer was no, because just about everything we have to say about this interim, this period between the Bronze Age and the emergence of the Polis, uh, most of it involves inferences from our understanding of what the Homeric poems tell us. Uh, but I think we need to take a hard look at what we can do and I thought it would be worthwhile reading a sentence each from the, uh, uh, introductory paragraphs that we provide for you in the problem to show you the range of opinion that is a pretty good, pretty representative of what scholars think or have thought on the subject. Moses Finley says, if then the world of Odysseus is to be placed in time as everything we know from the comparative study of heroic poetry says it must be the most likely centuries seem to be the 10th and the ninth.

Speaker 1:          00:02:17       That is to say what we call the dark ages. Antony Andrews says, it may be that the epic tradition had at some stage used as a model for the army before Troy. An idealized version of some of those bands of colonists who settled the coast of Asia minor in post Mycenaean Times. And if you look at the whole story that he tells, that really means quite soon after the fall of the Mycenaean world, probably maybe a century earlier than what Findlay suggests. And then, uh, am Snodgrass says, I offer this as a further argument against the existence of a historical Homeric society. There isn't anything to be found is what Snodgrass says. Ian Morris writes, the balance of probability seems to be in favor of a consistent basis to the society of the poems derived from Greece in the eighth century BC, which would be at the end of the period we've been talking about the transition to the world of the Polis Homer's own time when he lived in rose.

Speaker 1:          00:03:34       And finally, Barry Strauss says, ironically, the more homer exaggerates, the more authentic he is as a representative of the bronze age. So what do we do? Well, all of these are learned and clever men. Uh, but I don't think that they're all equally right. Uh, but what I should also report to you is that I think there is a widespread consensus among most people who study the subject. That doesn't mean that consensus is correct, but not all of these opinions are shared by the same number, by no means of uh, scholars. Some of them are far out. I would say the one that says you can't learn anything from this is an outlier. The notion that this is about the Mycenaean world is an outlier and then you get, I would say the largest consensus is something like Finley's consensus, but people verging in both directions.

Speaker 1:          00:04:40       From that, what you'll hear from me is essentially that consensus point of view. It strikes me as being better supported than the others, but we really have to keep an open mind because in this prehistoric period, which really we were still are in such a period, you have to be very modest about what you think you know about it. Almost everything is inference and judgment and very little is anything that you want to call proof with those warnings. Let me tell you sort of what, what the, what I think most people think about this. First of all, uh, if we want to know about the dark ages, what sources do we have available to us? And of course I've already mentioned the poems of homer turn out to be a very large source, uh, for what most people look to. Secondly, there are legends that the Greeks told about their early history, uh, which come down to us in later sources and they are available to us to use a source as a great question is should we use them at all?

Speaker 1:          00:05:54       And if we do, how carefully should we use them? And so on. This is a good time for me to make a confession so that you'll know how to judge what I say all through the course. Um, beginning, well, I'd say prior to the late 18th century when a German scholar began to look at the Homeric poems specifically very, very carefully and then really very, very skeptically and to make all sorts of suggestions that the poems that we have a really not to be thought of as the work of a single poet, homer who had brought them both out together but who were began to divide them up into early and late elements, which I thought drove the field of classics insane for about a hundred years. While they are folks who argued about the unity of homer, the unity, or not the unity of one of the poems and so on, but it began a critical study of the pumps for the first time and critical methods are applied to history for the first time ever, really in a night, early 19th century and thereafter.

Speaker 1:          00:07:06       And, um, it became common to reject any ancient story that wasn't really nailed down very, very firmly by some device to take a skeptical view. And an a very interesting example of how things change. If you look at people say English men writing about ancient Greece in the late 18th century, they tell the story of the early days based upon the legends as though the legends were reliable information to some degree. When you get to the, uh, say the middle of the 19th century in the work of the great English historian of Ancient Greece, George Grote, he begins his story in seven 76 with the Olympic Games. He does tell you all about the legends first, but he puts them aside and says, they're just legends. Now let's talk history. And he doesn't begin that until the eighth century BC. Uh, and so there is this critical school that says you, I won't believe anything unless it is proven to me.

Speaker 1:          00:08:16       At the other extreme, there's me, the most gullible historian imaginable. My principle is this, I believe anything written in ancient Latin or Greek, unless I can't now, things that prevent me from believing what I read are they are internally contradictory or what they say is impossible or different ones contradict each other and they can't both be right. So in those cases, I, the ancient evidence, otherwise you've got to convince me that they're not true. Um, now you might think of this as indeed gullible. A colleague of a former colleague of mine put the thing very, very well. He spoke about, and I like to claim this, this approach to position a of scholarship to which we'd call the higher naivet√© and hat. The way this works is you start out, you don't know anything and you're naive, you believe everything. Next you get a college education and you don't believe anything. And then you reach the level of wisdom to hire knife tay and you know what to believe, even though you can't prove it. Okay. Be Worn. I'm a practitioner of the higher knife day.

Speaker 1:          00:09:49       So I think the way to deal with legends is to regard them as different from, uh, essentially sophisticated historical statements, but as possibly deriving from facts, which have obviously been distorted and misunderstood, misused and so on. But it would be reckless. It seems to me, to just put them aside and not ask yourself the question, can there be something believable at the root of this? And just just to give you some small defense of that approach, I always like to ask you, I suppose saying we didn't have a single historical record, no newspaper, no diaries, you know, nothing totally reliable for what happened in the latter part of the 18th century in America. Would we know anything about what happened? Of course we would. We would know that there was a revolution. It was against Great Britain. I'm sure we would know that the French assisted in that I am certain we would know that George Washington was the commander of our forces in that battle.

Speaker 1:          00:10:59       Those are easy. There's no getting around. We'd know those things. Then then, then it gets to be more interesting as we speculate. We would know as a fact that George Washington through a silver dollar across the Rappahannock river, except that it's impossible so he could dismiss that one. We would be told that he was very honest and told his father he chopped down a cherry tree, which would be baloney. But we would be told that too. But I think we would be told also very many true things which came down to us. So the hard job would be to select among these legendary things to see what fact can be found. Then it will never be easier or deadly certain. But that's, that's what I'm talking about here. Um, finally there is the, uh, the source that people who are skeptical, most liked to believe because it's tangible.

Speaker 1:          00:11:49       I'm talking about archeology, which is the discovery and examination and valuation of material evidence that is not in writing the actual remains of places where they lived, the implements that they used and so on and so on. And the beautiful thing about that is you actually have it. It's objective. It's an object. It's not something that somebody imagined, but you shouldn't derive as much confidence from it as a lot of archaeologists like to because it's only a thing until you say what it means until you put a date on it. Until you, uh, try to understand what it really is, what its function was, who brought it there, who left it there. All those things have to be reasoned out from the, uh, all the evidence, all the information you can get. So there's a store, an astonishing amount of speculation involved in establishing this apparently rigorous objective technique.

Speaker 1:          00:12:52       You certainly need to use it and we need to use it as carefully. That's my point. As carefully as we use everything else. But it is indeed very valuable. And studying a world before our time, uh, always. Now we've mentioned how important the poems are. So we need to take a look at the question of what they are and how we know about them. And so on. I mentioned to you that, uh, these, the Iliad, the Odyssey when known in the Western world continuously from the time that they were made available, uh, so they will know and they were very important in the, in the minds of those people who knew about it. But, um, I also mentioned last time the impact of [inaudible] excavations, which turned everything around the hypers skeptical point of view taken by scholars in Europe in the 19th century was eroded very sharply by the discovery of places that really convinced pretty much everybody soon that they were Troy and that they were my CV.

Speaker 1:          00:14:00       And so the stories couldn't have been simple inventions and that began a new phase in the story. And again, to repeat what I said last time, there was certain stunning physical resemblances between what homer said and what we could see. The palaces were like the palaces that he described. The world that they lived in was a world in which bronze was what was used for implements and weapons and such, not iron and that squared with, um, what was found in my Sini, what was found and the Mycenaean world, namely bronze implements and fundamentally not orange ones. Sometimes there was a, there were interesting little problems that emerged. And one of those, it has to do with the use of chariots in warfare. Well, homer has, Cherry has his heroes using cherries and people. And we know, excuse me, we know the chariots were used in warfare in the bronze age around the Mediterranean Sea.

Speaker 1:          00:15:14       We have hard evidence of that in Egypt and Asia minor and in the Tigris Euphrates valley. So you would say, well that's another place where homer got it right, except for the fact that we also know how chariots are used in warfare. And uh, the closest analogy I think is distance. Think of chariots as tanks. Uh, you know, one famous tactic as if you, if you have an infantry force coming forward, uh, you send tanks in it to break up the line of the infantry and so that you can defeat the infantry in that way. And apparently that is the way you use chariots in ancient bronze age warfare. You would send the chariot racing toward the line of infantry men and the usual outcome was the infantry men would panic in the face of being charged by these things and would break their line and give the other side and opportunity to a wreck havoc with their army.

Speaker 1:          00:16:22       Well, what did the Homeric heroes do with their charities? They use them as taxi cabs, Achilles or patrol Patroclus or whoever is on his chariot, does the driver in front who's driving, he is writing down from the ships or wherever he is from the camp to the battlefield. He might pick up a, uh, a missile of some kind, a spear typically and fire it at somebody as he goes by. This would be a drive by killing. And, uh, uh, but then when he really gets to where the action is, he hops off and gets it. Now we're going to have some five. And so the implication I think is that the Ma, the memory of chariot warfare back in the Mycenaean days lingered was, was captured in the poetry that goes back the bits of the poetry that goes back to the Mycenaean period. But how they were used was forgotten.

Speaker 1:          00:17:25       And so the poets in the subsequent years then thought, how would I use a chariot? Never having seen a chariot fight in a battle. And that's the outcome. So at this, uh, Findlay particularly makes a lot of this as being rather indicative of how he pictures the poems work. There are sort of legitimate memories, some of them going way back to the Mycenaean period, but which may be misremembered in some significant detail. Uh, and then of course there's lots of stuff that doesn't have anything to do with the Mycenaean period. His view is much, if not most of what we are told about the Homeric world comes as he says in the 10th and the ninth centuries.

Speaker 1:          00:18:10       Um, one other thing, um, that he doesn't mention, but I think it's worth mentioning a many, a scholar is very reluctant to admit that there's any Mycenae and stuff here, whatever, although they cannot fail to concede that some of the physical implements that are found at Mycenae and sites are precisely like what homer says. But I think you can go a little bit beyond that. Some scholars have pointed out that in book two of the Elliott in the section that we call the catalog of ships, the poet lays out just exactly how many warships came to Troy from Greece. And just exactly how many came from each town and the names of the towns that are listed in that catalog of ships. First of all are all legitimate in the sense every one of them we know did exist in the Mycenaean period and perhaps no less significant is that there are also towns listed there that are Mycenaean towns, which disappeared after the Mycenaean period.

Speaker 1:          00:19:23       In other words, they couldn't just have named towns that used to be Mycenaean but was still around. So they, that's why they knew them. No, sometimes it that disappeared. The names of those towns show up in the catalog of ships. There's just no way to explain that except to say that catalog of ships goes back to the Mycenaean period. Now, the differences between what we find in the Homeric poems are also very illuminating differences between that and what we know happened after the fall of the Mycenaean world. For instance, one of the most striking things that you find in cultures, anthropologists and archeologists live off. This is how what they do with dead bodies. Now my Sini, it's obvious they bury them in the ground that as most of us do, the, uh, the graves in the circle, the shaft graves, and then that the beehive tombs for the big shots.

Speaker 1:          00:20:18       But even outside the country side, we find graves which have bones of people in them. But we know that the Greeks in, uh, in homer don't do that. The Greeks and homer have, uh, incinerate the bodies of the dead. You remember, um, uh, the, the, um, the Elliot ends with the, the actual cremation of the bodies of the relevant people. So that's a very significant difference. That memory had simply died out. And it helps us to remember to the, uh, tombs that we know we have seen now. They didn't see that whoever was writing the poems of homer, whichever, see, uh, poets were contributing to that over the ages. After the Mycenaean period. They hadn't seen those Mycenaean sites. They were buried. Um, there are also differences sometimes in the shape of weapons that we find in the Greek world after the Mycenaean period compared to what are described in Homer's poems.

Speaker 1:          00:21:35       And, uh, also, um, I'm sorry. Yeah. Homer describes certain of these weapons which don't fit what we find in the ground. Um, and here's another, a critical element in the story. The, we know that the Mycenaeans or at least some small number of them could write because we have the linear B script, which we can read. There is no clue that there is such a thing as writing in the Homeric poems is one very abstruse clue where somebody seems to know something about it. But fundamentally it's an illiterate society and that is a major difference between the world of homer and the Mycenaean world. Some other differences, Homer's kings, if you just see how they live, what they do, what their wives do, how they are treated by their fellow nobleman, they are an irrelative sense, very weak, very short on power and really quite poor compared to these Mycenaean kings that were the results of whose work and lives we see at places like [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:22:56       I remember I tried to emphasize how rich you would have to be to undertake the building of the temple to undertake the construction of one of those beehive tombs. You had to be a very confident because it was going to take a long time, fantastic amount of labor, a tremendous amount of money to do that. There is no evidence in homer that anybody had that kind of wealth or that kind of power. What do the, what do the Queens in homer do in their spare time? Or maybe it's not their spare time. Maybe it's their regular time. Well, one of the things that they do, in fact, when you, when, when, uh, the Homeric heroes referb to their wives, they're there. There were really only two places that they seem to be associated with. One is the bedroom and the other is the loom. What these ladies are doing is weaving cloth.

Speaker 1:          00:23:57       Now that's not what Queens do. I'm sure the Mycenaean Queen's didn't do that, but it's very, very interesting that that is where the Homeric queens do that. Well, how are we to explain the discrepancies that are so great between these worlds? And the answer that almost everybody now accepts without argument is that these poems were, uh, created orally and passed on orally that they were not written down. And so that what we have in the poems of homer reflects centuries of bards passing on bits of the poem of the poem and various versions being always creative. I mean, any barred if by analogy we know about bards in the modern world, we have some evidence on that. Milman parry was a, he's a Harvard scholar back in the 20s, went to Yugoslavia to live in the mountains in the backwoods. And he lived with people who were still had these bards around who created sort of epic narratives of considerable length, nothing resembling Homeric length, I must say.

Speaker 1:          00:25:20       Nothing that long, but long enough in which they would tell the same stories in verse and music. Uh, and you could recognize the story as you went from bar to bar, but every bard added and subtracted things to suit his own talents. That's the idea of the game. And then Perry demonstrated by careful scholarship of the Homeric poems that that is the way the Homeric poems were. In fact, I want to use the word stitched together because in the ancient Greek world, the people who sang, recited, created, uh, the poems of Ho, uh, of the, of the Homeric epics were called wraps sodas. And that means stitchers of songs. So what you have to imagine is sometime back, I would argue in the Mycenaean Mycenaean period, somebody began making up one of these songs, telling the story of Greeks going to attack the city of Troy.

Speaker 1:          00:26:29       And that for centuries thereafter, different wraps odes repeated that. But elucidated that, illuminated, that extended it, changed it, try to improve it. And uh, sometimes they added stuff they were alive in the 10th century. Some of them are alive in the ninth, and certainly some of them are alive from the time of homer in the eighth. So that, that what we have before us is that kind of product. And that will explain both the similarities and the differences. And that is what underlies our interpretation of how the poems got to be what they were. So what world, what does this world like that emerges from the world of homer. Even we don't have to make up our minds in advanced, whether it was a real world or a completely fantastic one, but at least let's see if we can describe what world it looks like.

Speaker 1:          00:27:28       And I'm going to focus my attention on the what you might call the political side of that society as it reveals itself in the poems we hear about key individuals. Uh, and I've used last time I mentioned to you two words I think I did, but I'll mention that again this time the, the head of the expedition to Troy Agamemnon, that sort of general and mo of that expedition is called one knocks. When you dropped the WWE as a Greek later dialects did, it becomes anoxic in later Greek. He is so far as I know, and I think I'm not forgetting I, he's the only human being referred to in the poems. In that way. There are however many of an individual in the palm who is referred to is a boss, allows the plural, is bossy lace, which is normally and regularly translated as king.

Speaker 1:          00:28:42       And that's, that's right. For instance, in historical times when the Greeks referred to the Great King of Persia who was a real king and a powerful figure figure king in every sense, uh, the word they used for him was bossy less. But we quickly see that the people referred to as Bacillus in homer, uh, are not like the great king of Persia. They are a much lesser figures. I'll come back to that in just a moment. The Mycenaean kings we know thanks to the linear B tablets were referred to the singular once again is one ox and the plural is one act tests. But in homer the term is reserved for Agamemnon or for Gods but not for any other human being. And that raises the question, why is Agamemnon one us? And that I think we have to understand as being big because of his function in the situation.

Speaker 1:          00:29:50       Namely, there is a multi city, uh, invasion of Troy being carried on by these Mycenaean Greeks. Agamemnon has been chosen as the general list demo and that is what gives him temporarily the title of one ox. I would, I would imagine, I'm very confident that after the war of Troy, if Agamemnon had been allowed by his wife to live for more than a few minutes after he set foot at home, he would no longer be called one ox, but would be called boss allows like the other rulers of their local towns. Uh, your mirror, you remember I suggested that in the linear B tablets, when there's a reference to a bus, Laos, uh, he's clearly well below the one ox and some scholars suggest in a persuasive way. I think that these Busta Laos may have been village chieftains, but that's as high as they got. But it's very interesting that when you get to historical grease, as we shall see, there are no one knock tastes, but there are, at least according to tradition, bossy lays.

Speaker 1:          00:31:07       But there's no, no bustle. Laos has anything like the clout that the uh, uh, mycenaen kings did. And of course we don't hear of any of them who have the, even the temporary special power that Agamemnon has. Nobody, no human being is referred to as one ox in the period of historical Greece. And of course the kings when we see them in homer, do not have a bureaucracy, do not have scribes. How could there be scribes? They didn't know how to write. There are no inventories. These are not rich guys with fantastic quantities of stuff that has to be cataloged and inventoried. The kings by our standards for kings are really very poor. What do they do in their spare time or in their time in general? They themselves engage in agriculture. I don't mean they dig in the ground but they supervise it but they, they think about it.

Speaker 1:          00:32:07       They are like uh, people who are in charge of a plantation there own plantation. I mean, so that's one of their activity. You cannot imagine the great kings of my Sini doing that. They would have had all kinds of subordinate officials taken care of that. The another thing that these kings are seeing to do, which is in a way, even at a lower level, is to be herdsman. Again, not themselves out there with the goats and the sheep, but refer to as having these herds and having to cope with them. Another very popular, I would say the most popular activity among the king's popular with the Kings was piracy. That's what they brag about. Kelly's my God bought a king. He is, he sacked 24 cities. Why do you Saca City to steal what they have and of, well, there are all kinds of wonderful examples.

Speaker 1:          00:33:05       Uh, people, uh, in the, in the Iliad, the Odyssey, some stranger comes, this is in the Odyssey and the, they ask him a sir, are, are you a pirate? And he says, no, no, I'm not a pirate. Just like they asked him. Um, I mean, you come from Chicago, it's a, that's he, he wasn't insulting. He didn't, I don't know. I'm not a pirate, but am I could have been. Of course we understand that. But, um, and then, but later on in the story that, uh, hotels in the Odyssey, Odysseus himself is such a newcomer. He comes, he's taken to the beautiful city, uh, on the island is scarier if ea Hsa and, uh, treated with great respect as you're supposed to be in the Mycenaean world. But after dinner, they, uh, they do what they do to amuse themselves. They have athletic contests and they ask, oh, just use to participate. And he says, no, no, I'm too miserable and wretched. And the guy says, oh yeah, you must be some kind of a merchant. And, uh, with issues is, that was a black remark. And, uh, those are fighting words. You can't call, we know just uses himself as a, a laussane. You don't call him a merchant. Pirate Short merchant know.

Speaker 1:          00:34:36       Um, another thing that is interesting is that when you look at the burials of Greeks in the post Mycenaean period and the dark ages, there's nothing resembling those grand tombs and the wealth that's buried in them for the dead. You find that the tunes of nobleman are very much the same one as the other. You're struck by the equality from the standpoint of riches of the dead. Uh, nobility. No, no great distinction and no great riches either. You're dealing with a poor world and a world that doesn't have this kind of outstanding monarchy. So, uh, one of the things I think we learned is that the Homeric world of the Kings, the role of the Kings, the wealth of the kingdom, the power of the Kings, the place of the kings is not taken from the Mycenaean period. If it's describing anything that's real, it's describing very clearly a post Mycenaean world, uh, in those dark ages that we have been talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:35:49       But another thing that crops up is that in the Iliad, the Odyssey, you get a very clear picture really of what is the political structure of each society. And by the way, you must keep in mind a very important difference between the Iliad and the Odyssey. The Iliad takes place at Troy. None of these noblemen, none of these kings, none of these heroes is back home in his own town ruling it. He is at war and he is serving under a commander. And so the behavior of these people towards one another is not precisely like what it would be and here you see in the Odyssey is what it would likely be and the place where you see it is as back in Ithica when a is there or when we're taking to see what's going on. I think that's a very important distinction to make.

Speaker 1:          00:36:44       But even when they were Troy and in this other sort of non a typical situation, we still see the same institutions working the same relationships being present as a would be present at home. Although you have to watch out for the difference. What do I mean? How are decisions made? Does the king simply say do it and it gets done? Nothing like that. The king has got important powers. Agamemnon has the chief out there in the Iliad. He can call a meeting of the assembly, but it turns out he's not the only one of the, I should say if the council will come to that in a minute, but he's not the only one who can. Any nobleman who wants to can say, we ought to have a counseling and then the council will come together and do whatever business they wish to do. The council, however, is limited to nobleman to these Boston lace. Ordinary soldiers do not attend. And that's one of the things I think we must grasp immediately. The key line in the society of the Dark Ages appears to be certainly not between monarchy and everybody else, but between nobility and commoners. That's the really important serious line up. Certainly politically and in other ways as well.

Speaker 1:          00:38:23       There is however, a in homer and assembly that consists of the men. In the case of Troy, of course the fighting men who were there but who are not bossy delays, but also in the, in the home at home, the men of fighting age and condition, they are the only ones who matter of course, as in all of the rest of Greek history, women are excluded from the political realm. Uh, and of course, uh, well I'll just leave it at that. Uh, but so too are the, uh, uh, there's a, there's obviously an age limit. You have to be of an age to be a fighting man. It's not necessarily defined for us. It depends on the could have been 18, could have been 20 in a, in Athens in classical times. It was 20. Um, well that, let, let, let me just remind you of some events that show you how these things work.

Speaker 1:          00:39:26       Remember the Elliot starts because of a quarrel and the quarrel emerges from the fact that the Greek Sir Bisley being killed by a terrible plague that has struck them. Uh, they said, we've got to find out what's happening, why they always assumed that if something like that happened, it was some God or gods who was angry with them. So they get a seer who goes and says, is persuaded to try to find out what's happening. And he finally does ascertain that Apollo is angry with the Greeks because Agamemnon took a maiden from her father and that, uh, father was a priest of Apollo. And so, uh, when this is ascertained, the Achilles, the biggest, bravest, strongest, fastest, a hero, uh, on the, on the Greek side intervenes and says, well, look, why don't you give back the girl and then Apollo will stop killing us and everything would be okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:33       Ag I'm in him, gets furious with Achilles and he says, no, I'm not giving back my girl. I'm the boss here. See as Edward G. Robinson, he used to say, and um, how many of you ever heard of Edward G. Robinson? Just raise your hand, please. Good. Put me in my place and it gets worse every year for me. Um, and um, Achilles then speaks up and really let some have it chosen that tells him what a Bozo is. Uh, and you know, there's very important thing is how can you do that if this is the king? And the answer is you can do that because you're both kings. There is nothing out of line in the sense of violating some kind of a real rule of the society. But it's not typical. And especially since Agamemnon has this position as the boss, the most kingly of the kings, that's the word that homer uses of him.

Speaker 1:          00:41:37       Bossy loop, top toss, the most kingly. And that's because of his position. So Achilles is not doing anything sort of illegal or unconstitutional, but he's doing something that's really out of line from a normal point of view. And finally, Agamemnon says, no, I'm not going to give back my girl, but tell you what, uh, I'll finally, I will give back my girl if I am given the girl you took from a different Trojan and that'll be fine. I'll have your girl and you won't have any. So now Achilles really blows its top. And uh, from the quarrel, I'm finally when he says, okay, if that's what you're going to do to me, I'm taking my armor and I'm going home. And off he goes and he soaks in his tent for the next nine books. And uh, this turns out to be a serious problem for them.

Speaker 1:          00:42:35       So that, but that what you learn from that is that the way decisions are made, important decisions are made even in this army is by discussion among the bossy lace among the nobleman. And, uh, you will try to reach a consensus about these things. And in an extreme odd situation like this, it would have to be that they would have to do what the commander says, but it would, and probably back home. That would be the, the implication that if you can't work things out among them with consensus, probably the king has some, some weight. But what we have to remember is you can't give orders to anybody typically, although Agamemnon can get away with it on this expedition. Well, that's one story and other stories that we're told is that soon afterwards, also in that same place in the Elliot, a dream comes to Agamemnon, cause you know, this is their 10th year.

Speaker 1:          00:43:32       They've been trying to take this city for nine years. It's, uh, it's almost as bad as Iraq. Um, and people are, the soldiers are tired of all of this. If we can't take the city, we, um, we ought to go home. And there's a lot of, is a spirit that says we ought to go home. And so, uh, a dream comes to a Agamemnon. The God says to him, here's what you need to do. You need to try the spirit of your men and two in, in that way too in spirit them to carry on until victory. So what you should do is to get up and speak to your soldiers and say that you're never going to take, uh, Troy. You might as well pack up and go home and then they'll say, no king, no, we refuse to do that. We insist on staying, we're going to re re up and do another term and we're going to take the city. So agrimonia says, great, I'll do that. And he calls the troops again the battle and he makes his little speech and then I can, I wish I could reproduce the home or I didn't take it along with me. But the essence of it is in a great roar and rumble emerge. There's the troops turned and began racing back to the ships to get the hell out of there.

Speaker 1:          00:44:51       Just to carry on some of the highlights of that story that tell us a little bit, a lot really about the society. So as they're roaring back, suddenly Odysseus to slice the cleverest, the smartest of all of the Greeks. He goes racing among the troops who are heading back in. He grabs one and homer says, when he came to a gentleman, a boss, the lace who say, sir, you are making a mistake. You don't understand the game that Agamemnon is playing. And he explains it to them. And the guy said, okay, when he comes to one of the common sort, he says, you bloody imbecile. Get the hell back to where you belong. That's a rough translation. And, uh, everybody finally grabs enough of them and the thing turns around, everybody goes back and sits down and, uh, up steps, one man suit, uh, homework describes him as the ugliest man in the entire army.

Speaker 1:          00:45:52       So you get a clue as to what we're supposed to think about him. And uh, he, he makes his speech, which denounces all of the Basa Lace Agamemnon ahead of any of them. And he says, we ordinary soldiers have had enough and we would like to go home and up steps Odysseus and blessed him with his septor, smashes him across the back, leaving a welt that could be seen by the entire army. And tears came to the eyes of this guy. Are we supposed to feel sorry for him? Well, the next lines in Homer's, say one soldier popped up and said, of all the great things Odysseus has done for us here, that was the greatest to shut up big mouth idiot. Like their societies. Well, what's their Saudis had done that was wrong. Of course, uh, the poet and a and the dishes didn't like his policy suggestion, but what he really had them, he had no right to speak at all.

Speaker 1:          00:46:59       The only people who could speak in the council or in an assembly where the nobleman, the boss delays. So he had crossed the line in as an ordinary soldier. And to rise and to say anything was a violation of the culture. And that's one of the places where you see whether it's sharp line exists, they just take orders. But the gentlemen don't just take orders, they can argue and sometimes can win the argument. So what you see in this very brief and inadequate account that I've given you is that we really, in spite of the fact that we have bossy lace and even in this case, uh, uh, [inaudible], we really don't have a proper monocryl tradition. When we think of monarchs single rulers, we think of Hama, Robby and we think of, uh, the kings of Persia. And we think of Louis the 14th. We do not think of what we have here, which is a bunch of noblemen who are essentially equal.

Speaker 1:          00:48:06       And the differences between them don't come from birth or rank as between them, but from wealth and power that they happen to possess. It is rather not a royal society, but an heiress to crack society. I think that's the, the main message. And it is the matrix of all future political ideas and arguments in the Greek world that comes after this time. I think, yeah, you need to understand that. Um, what the Greeks in the historical period, once we start having written records by the Greeks themselves, the thing that is the, this is the standard position. What does this thing on the computer, when you fall back to a position, what do you call that position? Huh? Say it again. No, no, no fallback. What does it default? That's right. Good. The default position in a Greek political theory is aristocracy. That is done normal thing.

Speaker 1:          00:49:20       Uh, a good, uh, I've, yes, a very good example of that is what I've been telling you that that's really what happens. And here's another thing. If you go to the end of the Greek a story, uh, when you think about political theory, there's Plato and when he lays out the ideal society in his view, in the republic, we find there are multiple rulers. And these of course turned out to be the, uh, the windows of the jeopardy contest. Uh, playoffs. But it doesn't matter is never one cane. It's always a group of people that the best government and they will be the best in his case, the defined by chiefly by their intelligence. But other things too. Uh, well anyway, in this case in Greek political thinking, the aristocracy of birth is the default position. Anybody who wants to argue for a different kind of political arrangement, we'll have to make the case uphill against all tradition.

Speaker 1:          00:50:30       I hope that you'll have that in the back of your head when we get to the story of Athens and the invention of democracy cause it was off the wall from the perspective of Greek tradition and of course anybody from time to time, they were individuals who thought that Monica might be a fine thing. They pop, ran against something that was even much, much more, uh, regarding with much more hostility by the Greeks when they're through, you know, when they've reached their peak. Their notion of monarchy is something fit for barbarians. But not for Greeks. A free man may not live under a monarchy. And the roots of that I think, uh, are visible in home brand and passing. I just want to say that homer, of course, is the basic text, the basic document for all Greek thinking in every area that you can imagine throughout the rest of the Greek history.

Speaker 1:          00:51:32       Over time, it becomes not the only one, but it never ceases to be the best known, the most influential, the most powerful. Uh, if it were a religious document, primarily we would speak of it as the Greek Bible, but, uh, it isn't nonetheless, well, some examples later on in history, uh, somebody, there's a quarrel between Athens and mega as to who controls the island of Salamis. They decide to call in an arbitrator. So they call in the Spartans and the Spartans, Zay, okay, we'll decide. And they decide that it belongs to athletes. Why? Well, if you look at the catalog of ships in Homer's Iliad than the island of Sal Amiss had his ships lined up next to the island of Athens ballgame.

Speaker 1:          00:52:22       It's just you have to realize how potent this is. Well, let me turn to another aspect of the story of homer end, how the poems play into a Greek society. I want to talk to you about the ethics and values that emerge from the reading of the Iliad, the Odyssey. I mentioned religion and so we should take a look first at the gods. We are talking, first of all, I remember about a uh, multimedia t society. Polytheism is what we're talking about. That is true of all of human societies that we know anything about down to the earliest possible exception, I suppose. Well, it depends on what you think. His earliest, you could say the Hebrews are the earliest, pure and simple, but depending on how you date biblical things, there's an outside chance that an Egyptian Pharaoh in the 16th century BC, I think, uh, might have claimed to have some such state. But otherwise there is no such thing. So this is a policy is stick society with heroic characteristics that is this kind of arrows to cratic outfit, aristocracy of birth, which is legitimized by heroic behavior on the battlefield.

Speaker 1:          00:53:56       Now, one of the things the Greeks believed as we discover from a poem written by one of their major poets is something that so far as I know, unique to the Greeks, they claimed that they were of the same race as the gods. And I really don't know of anybody else who made that claim. Um, and so they, you will hear Homeric characters referred to by epithets. Homer, part of the technique of passing on oral poetry is by having epithets attached to the rulers to help with the meter. Some hero will be called [inaudible], meaning godly God like the old Trefis reared as a God east. So theos equal unto a God. And there are others as well. Now mind you, notice these are not people refer to as God fearing or lovers of God. No, they are just about equal to the gods according to these terms.

Speaker 1:          00:55:12       Now that on the one hand is this extraordinary claim that the Greeks make. They did make amazingly powerful claims for human beings as opposed to divinity compared to any society that I know. Anything about. Part of the arrogance that is characteristic of the ancient Greeks, but at the same time and right away at the beginning with getting to such a very Greek thing at Greek characteristic at the same time that he has this great thing almost like a God. He is also not a god in the most crucial way possible. Gods do not die. Men Die. The mortality of the human being is a reality and it's of the greatest significance and importance. And of course men are not as strong and as powerful as the gods. And indeed as we shall see, well the tragic view of life, which the Greeks invent and which characterizes their culture is they're right at the beginning in the Iliad and the Odyssey, it says that at the same time as man is a remarkable marvel as creature capable of all sorts of amazing things, even on being almost like the gods.

Speaker 1:          00:56:43       He is nonetheless mortal and dies and he doesn't have the power that the gods do. And what do you do about that? Well, it's interesting I think to compare the Greek way of dealing with this human problem that we all have the problem of death. How do we deal with the fact that we will die? Well, there's what I like to call the eastern solution that you find in many an eastern religion and philosophy that says that man is in fact nothing. He is dust, he is dung. Depending on which story you listened to. So of course you're going to die. Who Cares? Why should you care? You are nothing to begin with. You'll be nothing when you're finished. Relax.

Speaker 1:          00:57:36       Then there is what I would characterize it as the Christian solution. You're worried about dying. You need not die. If you are a good Christian and you do all the things that you need to do to be a good Christian, you will not die. You will have personal immortality. So that's how you get around that problem. No need to worry if you're doing things right. Well, somehow Christians continued to worry and we have millennia of them killing each other about how you're supposed to worry about these things. But, but, uh, but on, if you can accept the purity of the statement I just made, it's at the root of the thing. You have a solution. But the Greek tragic view does not take either of these routes, which I regard as a relatively easy escape from the problem compared to the way the Greeks got stuck.

Speaker 1:          00:58:37       Man is great and they keep saying so he is important, he is capable of great things. He is of the same race as the gods. And at the same time is life is short and death is final and death is bad. I ought to say a word about death in order to comprehend what the Greeks thought. You know, different people's have had different ideas about them. Sometimes the notion is, is it's just terrible for everybody with actually pain and suffering. And others have a notion of a wonderful kind of a heaven in which marvelous things happen to you. Sometimes spiritual, sometimes physical, depending on the religion.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:59:24       but for the Greeks, as I think for a quite a few other people in the ancient world, death was nothing in the board sense of the word. You just went somewhere and there was nothing, there was darkness, there was nothing at all. Some few people who had sinned terribly and earned the wrath of the gods would indeed be tortured in some special and typically Greek. Interesting way. Uh, you remember a Tantalus, he had done a terrible thing and there he stood forever with his feet in the water below and above him, a tree with grapes hanging down and dying of thirst. And every time he went down to try this sip some of the water, the water receded. And anytime he reached up for the grapes, the grapes were pulled back. That is a Greek idea of hell. Well, you got to keep trying and you always lose.

Speaker 1:          01:00:36       So, uh, but that's, that's the picture and the other, you have to realize that death is a bad thing in the Elliott. I'm sorry, the Odyssey. Oh, just use has reason to go down to hades. And while he's down there, he comes upon Achilles who has died and he says, well, it's good to see you achilles. Say you look fine. You must really be doing okay down here. I know that you are a judge down here and much respected. So it looks like you have beaten the rat and Achilles says, oh, dishes. Don't say a word to me about the virtues of death. Better to be a surf, the lowest surf on the earth than to be a king and hades.

Speaker 2:          01:01:34       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:01:35       that's as bad as it can possibly be. The Great Achilles respected still in the afterworld would immediately turn it in to be a complete nobody on earth. So, so it's very important they faced without any real retreat, the reality and the uh, the negative character of death, even as they refuse to reject the significance of life or of mankind. That is what I mean when I speak of the tragic view and it's very important. Now it seems to me we can eliminate that a little bit by comparing it with various modern approaches to the same sorts of problems. We gotten rid of those problems yet in spite of modern medicine there we lived still, I think in what might be called the age of the enlightenment. That is the dominant sort of paradigm of what life is all about, at least in the Western world. And a good deal more of it where the West has had an influence at the core of it is a belief in progress.

Speaker 1:          01:02:48       Something that was essentially not present among the Greeks progress in the eyes of the philosophers of the 18th century. Though they would have been very angry to hear me say this was something like the equivalent of Christian hope for immortality. The hope of the Voltaires of this world was that they could make the world better constantly by their efforts. And this would be rewarded in a kind of the way, because progress in the future after they were gone would redound to their credit for having brought it about me. And that in some sense they would live on in this society, which had, they had improved and made a better thing. Another aspect that is very important in this, uh, sort of, uh, enlightenment approach is individualism. That the core of everything is the single individual person. As we shall see, this is very different from the Greeks.

Speaker 1:          01:03:56       Now, the Greeks were very much concerned with individualism and this is especially true of the, uh, Democrats in Athens. But even they, even they, even their most potent spokesman and leader placed the goals and achievements and everything else of an individual behind something that they thought was more important, which was to community at large, which in historical times was us. Well, that's not the way it is with the modern world. And that's not the way it comes out of the enlightenment. The individual is the ultimate, uh, the enlightenment. If you go back to its roots in the 17th century with the, with the likes of Hobbes and Locke, uh, what is the ultimate place you go to? It is the rights of individuals. You may not stamp out the rights of individuals. They are inherent in everything. Either you believe, as our founding fathers said that they were, we were in doubt, uh, bought with them by our creator.

Speaker 1:          01:05:10       They didn't say God because of course the enlightenment thinkers, we're not so sure they believed in God, but they still seem to believe in something they wanted to call a creator. Um, so or if you didn't believe in God, this was just a natural right nature gave each individual the right to life, liberty property, and nobody could take these away legitimately. Well, the Greeks had no concept of natural rights or of rights that human beings were given by the gods. That is a very important difference. That was you had to act in such a way as to make life possible and decent. And for the Greeks, that always meant being part of a decent community, the polls, but the modern world to get back to that, to this enlightenment world, individualism and a key aspect to that as hedonism. That is to say it is legitimate and proper to search for pleasure, for each individual to attempt to please himself however he can.

Speaker 1:          01:06:23       And it turns out that there, if you could take it to our own day, there are no limits, pretty much to what he can do to gain pleasure. I would argue that there is a direct line from the enlightenment philosophy to nihilism. That is to say a philosophy that says there are no limits to what human beings may do. What turns out to be the practical fact is that he who has the power and the will to do what he wants, we'll be able to do so. And he who has not will be forced to suffer whatever the powerful impose on him. And this is seen by the original nihilist as a good thing. Uh, what's his name? Uh, nature of course said some of us are, are better than others. Some of us are super men and it's quite wrong and wicked for us to be treated as though we were ordinary fellows and therefore do not tie us down with these ridiculous codes of ethics and morals and other things which are simply the weapons by which the week hold down the strong.

Speaker 1:          01:07:32       This was an interesting idea, but it wasn't noon. There's a Greek in the fifth century. He says the same thing. Um, there is no definition of goodness for this modern approach. No definition of happiness. Each individual decides sore himself. What is good, what has happened? What it really does does is to evade the question that I'm talking about. Is this all okay? If we're all going to die, then does it really mean that we should just do the best we can at anybody's expense while we're alive? Is that a satisfactory outcome? Will we indeed be happier, better off while we're alive? If we do that, the Greeks would have that is stupid and absurd. If you think for 10 seconds, you realize that's no good.

Speaker 1:          01:08:25       Now, the Greeks on the other hand had a powerful belief in the dominance of chance. They accepted what I again, is a very modern idea now that in fact, there is no divine force or divine forces who oversee what happens to mankind on earth. But rather things happen simply in a random way according to no particular rule. Uh, and that's the way it is. It is not virtue or merit that determine the quality of your life. It is chance. And, uh, there were several places in the Iliad and the odyssey that, um, emphasize that point well that leaves the Greeks with this, something like this question in the light of human mortality to disinterest of the Gods, the chances of life, what can man do to achieve happiness and immortality because he still doesn't feel happy about his mortality. Though he accepts that this is a problem.

Speaker 1:          01:09:41       It's something that he still hankers after. It's inevitable that people should and part of the answer is very Homeric. It is the heroic ethic at a certain place. I think a couple of places in the Elliot, uh, Achilles tells us, ask why, why did you come here to uh, to uh, fight? Uh, Troy we are told, we know the, the legend says Achilles was told before he came that if he did not go to Troy and fight in that war, he, because his, uh, his mother was a goddess, he had partial divinity in him. He, uh, would be immortal. He would never die. But on the other hand, he would not be great and famous. His memory would not be carried forward into the future. If he went to Troy, he would die. But his memory as the greatest of the Akins would be immortal forever. Well, you know, the choice he took and you know that it turned out to be right. We still know about Achilles don't mean, and when, when we were all gone, people will know about Achilles. So we should take the Greeks very seriously on that score.

Speaker 1:          01:11:01       Well anyway, sometimes he's asked, uh, what? What made you come here in spite of that? And his answer was, well, when my father sent me here, he told me a number of things that I'm supposed to. But the most important of these was the Greek words. I ain our risk. Stay away always be the best. The best doesn't mean morally the best in anything. Like our sense, it means the greatest, the strongest, the ablest, the most admired. That is what you want to be. Well, you can only do that if you are in a contest. You can only be the best if somebody is not as good. And the Greek word for that kind of a contest is a Goan AGLN. And so it's fair to think about the Greeks. I think it's very necessary to think about the Greeks as having a particular at Gono society, a society filled with competition in which if not everybody, lots and lots of people are constantly striving to be the very best, whatever the definition of best is in the context that's relevant. Now, I guess I'm out of time, so I'll pick up the story next time it with the story about this heroic ethic and the impact that it has improved society.
