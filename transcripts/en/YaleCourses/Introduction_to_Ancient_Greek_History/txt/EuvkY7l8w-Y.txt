Speaker 1:          00:00:01       The period in which the Greek pulleys were left essentially to their own devices, came to an end with the clash between the Persian empire and, uh, that some of the Greek city states, uh, but which came to involve, uh, Athens at the famous battle of marathon in four 19. And I'd like to tell you today about the, the rise of the Persian empire and it's conflict with the Greek st concluding with the account of that battle. The Persians, uh, first some terminology, uh, the Persians were what the, uh, thanks very much. Well, what the, um, the Greeks called them and that was appropriate. They were very close cousins of the people who lived, uh, right next to them or among them called the Medes. In fact, the Medes where the first of that group of, uh, I guess we could call them, um, Arion people's.

Speaker 1:          00:01:10       Again, that's a term that has been abused, uh, throughout the 19th and 20th century. Applying to as though it was a racial group. The term is a linguistic one, and they spoke a branch of the Indo European family of languages, which is designated as Arion. Uh, and that's all that really means, but they're very, very close. In fact, the Greeks really couldn't distinguish between the Persians and the errands and so, um, they call them sometimes needs in some time between the Medes and the Persians, I mean, and sometimes they call them means and sometimes they call them Persians. It really doesn't matter because although the Medes took the lead in forming a national kingdom out of a tribal society and we're the first to be the dominant family on the Iranian plateau where these people finally settled down, the Persians then overthrew them and establish themselves as the ruling group in that family under Cyrus the great as he was called back probably in five 59, he was called Cyrus the great because he was a great conqueror.

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       First making his tribal associates, the Persians, the dominant force in Iran, and then expanding the extent and the power of what we can now call the Persian empire and extraordinary distance. If we look at the end of the lifetime of Cyrus one man's lifetime is when this extraordinary expansion, much of it, most of it takes place. If you look at the Near East in the year five 50 BC, what you find is the Kingdom of media, the Kingdom of Babylonia, which is the most powerful one in the Tigris, Euphrates valley, what is now Iraq, the Kingdom of Lydia occupying sort of the western portion of Asia minor excluding at first the coast, which was occupied by Greeks, but which the Lydians then conquer the Greeks, uh, in the five forties, um, that, but that's the picture. And then there is the, the people of Persia, the Persians themselves who are of not much account.

Speaker 1:          00:03:48       But when Cyrus becomes king in five 59, he is a member of the dynasty, which is the [inaudible] dynasty. And he conquers his fellow Aryans the needs and about five 15 and very swiftly conquers Babylonia. Armenia, Syria, Kappa Dosha, which is another kingdom in Central Asia Minor, uh, and has already expanded this a kingdom to something pretty much unexampled up to that time. Now. Meanwhile in Lydia, the dynasty that began back in the seventh century finds that the king creases is the monarch in the, at that point, uh, you will have remembered of course, that Hurghada is his first book, pretty much begins its story with a King creases and his decision to attack the Persian empire, which is now on his frontier, a new old member. The story that Herat Herat, it just tells. So charmingly the, a story of how it increases, decides he wants to conquer the Persian empire. Consults the article of Apollo at Delphi to see how he's going to make out the article gives a characteristically enigmatic answer, but he doesn't recognize the enigma, the answer. He says, what will happen if I crossed the Halley's river? That's the boundary between, uh, uh, Lydia, which had been, I'm sorry, between Lydia and the Persian territory, uh, the article answers a great empire will be destroyed. And of course he had in mind destroying the Persian empire. Instead, the person's destroyed his empire. And of course that shows you, you've got to ask the right question and keep answering until you get an answer. You understand?

Speaker 1:          00:05:46       Well, um, quizzes, attacks, uh, in five 47, his capital of Sardis falls into the hands of the Persians in the next year. And so now the Persians are in control of the Lydian Empire. And uh, in, uh, on the frontiers of the Greek cities on the coast of Asia Minor. And the conquest of those cities takes place in the years. Five 46 to five 39, five 39 is a very big year for the Persians because in that year, they conquer the city of Babylon and thereby gained control of all of Mesopotamia. Another one of the major expansions of this vast empire, the successor to, uh, Cyrus is a cam by cs. And in the years between five 30 and five 22, he conquers amazingly enough the Kingdom of Egypt, perhaps the oldest, but certainly if not almost the oldest of the kingdoms of that region, fantastically wealthy and in its own right, formerly a great empire.

Speaker 1:          00:07:02       Now, if you stop in five 22, when cam by sees dies, you see that the Persian empire extends on the West from the Aegean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. To the West all the way to the Indus River in what is now Pakistan. And I'm from the south to really to, um, what is now Sudan at the southern end of the Nile river and up north to include the European coast of the Hellespont and the region and the waters that the straights and the European coast of the GNC. And, um, he comes right up as far as the Danube River and nor is that the end of what he would like to do, can buy these launches, an invasion of the territory beyond the Danube, which was not in the, in the shape of any kind of a national kingdom yet. Just an area filled with different kinds of tribes, which the Greeks called Scythians pushing all the way back into Russia, all the way back to the Caucasus mountains and perhaps beyond these, um, uh, horse riding, um, tribal people called the Scythians who didn't even really engage in agriculture.

Speaker 1:          00:08:35       But we're still in the business of, of living off a herds of animals. Well, the, uh, the expedition goes forward. It ends up gaining the straits and massive don, as I told you before, or I should have told you those names. Anyway. Um, the story is told that one of the generals of the Persian army is a certain mill tighties mill. Tyrese was originally an Athenian, but his family had been expelled. And the time of the time I'll rather they had been sent to govern the Gallipoli's peninsula, the Thracian curse Denise as the Greeks called it. And uh, so he lived up there and then when the Persians came and took that territory, he became a subject of the great king and he became a general in the great king's army. He and some others were given the task of guarding the bridges across the Danube while the king was chasing, assessing Ian's on the other side.

Speaker 1:          00:09:38       Well, he was unable to defeat the Scythians who used Scythian tactics, which is to say on cavalry, stayed away, avoided a direct conflict, and did damage, um, with missiles at a distance and ran away when they couldn't, uh, when they were about to face a great Persian army, which could defeat them. So he was gone a long time and while he was gone, no tidy, said he'll never come back. Why don't we just break down these bridges to make sure we never gets back and then we'll be free of the Persians. Well, it didn't work out that way. And the, uh, the city, Mississippi and campaign didn't succeed, but the Persian army came back and a mill tighties had to run off and escape because there was certainly a price on his head and he ended up going back to Athens where we will run into him again.

Speaker 1:          00:10:37       So, um, that is the situation when we get to the turn of the fifth century. The Persians are in control. They have gained mastery of all the Greek states of Asia Minor. The typical relationship between those cities and the king of Persia was the same as all of his subjects. He insisted in every case that the defeated states who came under his power should give earth and water to him as a symbol of their complete subjection to him. There was no kind of relationship to the great king except of one of complete subject subjugation. The Greeks regarded that relationship as one of slavery.

Speaker 1:          00:11:29       Um, but as a matter of fact, the Persians were not harsh rulers for the most part. All they required of the subject peoples was that they should pay a tribute to the king. And it was obviously not one that couldn't be met. Obviously nobody likes to pay a tax, especially to a foreign conqueror. But, uh, it wasn't something that, uh, destroyed the economy and to do military or naval service at his command and under his command as well. So those, if you did that, they left too long at this point of the, um, the characteristic regime was to have a tyranny appointed by the, the great king of Persia in each Greek city. But you should remember, I use that word and its original concept. It doesn't mean they were harsh. It doesn't mean they were particularly cruel. They were the satraps, the representatives of the king in that region, and they had absolute control.

Speaker 1:          00:12:30       But, uh, we don't hear about any specially harsh treatment of anybody. That's the situation when we will come very shortly to the beginning of conflict between the Greeks of the mainland and the Persian empire when the Ionian rebellion breaks out. But before that happens, we need to go back to Greece and see what's going on there. [inaudible] remember in Athens, the Cli Stenek Revolution has taken place. The new hoplite democracy that I have described to you is brand new and very insecure, fearful that there are enemies within. Some of them are friends of the, uh, uh, the, um, Arab Socratic families that have been defeated and fled some of them friends, relatives of the tyrants whose loyalty to the new regime is not clear. So that's one fear. Another fear is that the Spartans will not accept their expulsion and the expulsion of their friends. But we'll come back again with an army to try to conquer Athens and turn it over to the rest of Kratz.

Speaker 1:          00:13:49       And yet a third problem, Athenian neighbors with whom the Athenians have old quarrels may take advantage of their beleaguered situation and attack them. So that's has to be remembered. Athens is in a very insecure spot. And Herodotus tells us, excuse me, that in these circumstances, the Athenians attempt to get help by sending a mission to the king of Persia, asking for an alliance with Persia as a way of fending off these troubles. And of course the king only knows one relationship with other states. He doesn't know anything about alliances that have any, uh, equality associated with them. He asks the ambassadors of the Greeks, sorry, of Athens to give him earth and water and then they can be friends. Uh, the ambassadors say, okay, we'll do that. But when they come back to Athens, the Athenians are outraged that they have done so. They punish the embassy and there is no relationship between Persia and the Athenians and indeed what they feared it happens.

Speaker 1:          00:15:07       The Spartans invade Attica. And as they are doing that, they are joined by other states who have their own grievances with Attica, be Osha, led by thieves. CALC II switches the city and you'll be here just to the east of Attica and current just down the road on the [inaudible], they are all going to attack the Athenians. But it turns out that the Corinthians Balk at this, uh, idea. And what they don't like they say is the notion of installing some kind of a tyranny in Athens. They have had the experience of tyranny. They have expelled the type activity not so very long ago. They claim and they are not about to, uh, join anybody in doing the same thing. So that's one source of, um, division that prevents this coalition from attacking the Athenians. But there's also a quarrel between the two spartan kings Coriani's who has been there before and who very much wants to take Athens in maternity to his arrows, Socratic friends and kingdom or [inaudible] who for whatever reason is not willing to do that demo rate as loses the argument he is finally charges are brought against them and he flees.

Speaker 1:          00:16:31       And next we will find them demo radius in the Persian empire at the elbow, sometimes of the king and uh, giving him advice as to how to deal with the situation. Well, because of these things, there is no invasion. The Athenians are now free to turn against the other. They're neighbors who have threatened them against the B ocean. City's led by thieves against cal keys and the Athenians defeat their opponents in cal keys on the island of Euboea, the Athenians take away a chunk of land from the child Citians and plant 4,000 Athenian settlers on that land. And they do so not as a colony in the traditional sense, not as an appboy Kia, but as what the Greeks call a clearer key, which is this, these 4,000 Athenians who take the land settle there permanently, but they remain Athenians. They are still Athenian citizens.

Speaker 1:          00:17:39       They are really functioning as an Athenian garrison to see to it that things in Biasha are okay in this way. They very closely resembled the Roman idea of a colony, which was typically typically a collection of veterans after putting after conquering some other town in Italy, they would take some of that land, give it to Roman legionaries and let them settled permanently there as a garrison on behalf of the Romans. Well, that's what the Athenians do. In the case of, uh, uh, calculus orotic this sort of sings in Aria at this point about the wonders of freedom in which he says the Athenians were no better than any other Greeks at warfare before they became free. But once having liberated themselves from tyranny and establishing this new Kleist Stenek regime, they were able to defeat all of their opponents. And so, uh, so much for the erotic, this is prejudice.

Speaker 1:          00:18:43       But of course, as you read his sister, you will realize that in, in one sense, at least the, uh, the history of Hurghada is a on to the, uh, the wonders of freedom and the greatness of freedom and this and [inaudible] of freedom as the story of the Greeks. Um, by the way, he also praises not just freedom Eleuthera Rhea is the Greek word, but in the case of Athens, he praises it's east say goal Rhea. That word really means equality of speech. He characterizes this new class, authentic regime, not by the word democracy, which is apparently not really been coined yet, but rather as what characterize it is that all citizens are free, equally able to address the populace in the assembly and thereby the take an active role in their own government. So he's really praising autonomy, self-government, not merely freedom from an alien people, but freedom within the city for all the people to govern themselves.

Speaker 1:          00:19:56       He thinks that's one of the reasons why the Athenians have become so good at warfare because of these changes. Now, a new coalition emerges also hostile to this new Athenian regime. It includes Athens old enemy, the island of [inaudible], which sits in the, uh, ceramic Gulf right opposite the Athenian coast. Um, and it, it has, as I say, they have been fighting each other now for more than a century and quarreling about this and that. So the, each and Eton's join with the Spartans and now they are openly attempting to destroy this regime and to replace it with a return to the tyranny of hippies. Hippiest has also fled to the Persians and is protected by the king so that you have the notion of having, um, even if the Persians get involved, they too, and they will get involved. We'll want to put hippiest on the throne in Athens, but the Spartans want to do the same thing.

Speaker 1:          00:21:07       And again, the Corinthians, we'll have none of that because of their attitude towards chairmen now threatened even more severely, the Athenians send a second mission to Persia and this time the Persian king makes it very clear that will require that the Athenians put down their newly established democracy and restore hippiest to his tyranny in Athens, which would make Athens like the other Greek city states, the ones that are on the coast of Asia Minor, uh, part of the Persian empire and hippiest in his relationship to pressure would be the sand trap of the great king governing his own city, which was I think commonly what was happening in Asia minor on the Greek coast too. That's where we are. When the Ionian rebellion breaks out in the year for 99, the start comes in the city of my Litas, which was of course a leading city of the Greeks of that area for some long time, a place you will remember that was filled with new ideas where we first hear about the kinds of quasars scientific.

Speaker 1:          00:22:35       But in any case, rationalistic revolution that challenges the traditional Greek way of thinking based largely on mythology and on theology with pure reason. I don't want to suggest that the my legion philosophers were without religion. I'm simply saying they were introducing something new that stands on the side of religion and when it comes to their attempt to explain what they are trying to explain the physical universe, for the most part, it really does put aside religious concepts and replace them with observation and reason as the way to do things. So what we are seeing of course in my latest is the birth of philosophy. At the same time as we are seeing the birth of, um, natural science. And these do not get separated until many, many, many years later on. They are together. That's the city where the rebellion starts, has nothing to do with philosophers.

Speaker 1:          00:23:37       It has to do with the tyrant of my leaders and my lesion by the name of Eris taggers who gets into trouble with the great king. He has talked the great king into an expedition that he wanted to launch against the island of neck sauce in the Aegean Sea. He says his knack sauce is a cinch. It's a nice fat place. They're not ready. If we sail now secretly I'll be able to quickly take the island and the great king. We'll have another, um, uh, expansion of his empire. And of course, Arrowstar rigorous would benefit both financially and also by the presumed honor that he would gain from the great king. Unfortunately, uh, they're, um, intelligence per, it's the secure, the security procedures were inadequate and what he was up to gut to Naxos before he did. And the next scions we're ready. He was defeated and uh, the great king was not pleased era staggers, knew he was in a lot of trouble.

Speaker 1:          00:24:46       And so he decided that this was the time for the Greeks of Asia minor to acquire their freedom from the Persians. And he was obviously a very persuasive talker and went around to the various Greek cities and was able to persuade most of them to join in the rebellion, which is indicative of course if the fact that they were not happy in their position as subjects of the great king. So they rebel against the tyrants who have been collaborating with the great king. And this is an interesting point, they establish democracies now since as far as we know, there is no democracy in the world and it never has been before the one established in Athens just a few years ago. I think there's a lot of reason to think that the idea of doing that came from Athens. And that is easily believable when you realize that Athens, as I've told you before, is an Ionian city just as these cities, my elitist and the other towns that they get to join them at first, our Ionian cities and the Athenians are recognized by the other own Ionians as the leading Ionian city.

Speaker 1:          00:25:57       So that all of that makes me think that it's hard to avoid the conclusion that it's Athenian democracy that is the model for these rebellious Ionian states. But Agora stagger was, knows that he's going to be facing a formidable enemy in the forces of the Persian empire. And so he goes back to mainland Greece to seek help for his, uh, undertaking. And the first place you're going to go if you want military assistance in the Greek world, of course, is Sparta. And there indeed, he goes, uh, again, charming stories that our auditors tells about it. He goes to King [inaudible] and he tells him he would, uh, what he's trying to do and he tells him how rich the Persian empire is and how if they are successful in this rebellion, they will be able to see some of the wealth in the territory of the Persian king.

Speaker 1:          00:26:52       And won't that be nice for clay nominees and perhaps with the Spartans as well. Uh, clean. How many's um, he says, well, I dunno know, he sort of scratches his head and, and uh, he says, uh, how far is the Capitol of Persia from your city on the coast of the GNC? And a bearish staggers is sharp shrude cookie. And so he says, I'm glad you asked me this question. And he pulls out the first recorded map in all of Greek history and presumably unrolls it. And he chose you. You see, here's my leaders. And then there's this royal road and if you take it down here, here is a Souza, the capital of the Persian. This is, how far is that? How will the, how long would it take me to march from the coast to there? He says three months clean. When he says stranger, get out of town by duck.

Speaker 1:          00:27:50       The idea of suggesting to the Spartans that they, they should launch an expedition across a c, which will then take them the army, they take their army three months, March away from the coast, not to mention from Sparta leaving the city of course, open to a hell lot rebellion all the time. They're gone. That is not a very welcome suggestion. So Aricept egret says, well, you know, it's not really so bad. They got this good road. Uh, besides, I have here some several Minai of silver that are glad to give to you. Might want to think again. Uh, and he keeps raising the amount that he's prepared to bribe clean nominees at a certain point. Clean nominees. Little daughter Gorgol has been sitting there all the time. And being a spartan girl, she gets to up to her father and says, father, ask this man to leave at once or he will corrupt you.

Speaker 1:          00:28:49       Clay nominees accepted the admonition from his nine year old daughter and sent [inaudible] away. So the effort to gain spartan support in this rebellion fail. Well, error Segrest says, okay, I'll go, I'll try Athens now. It happens. Of course he's got a much better shot in the first place. Athens is an Ionian city, unlike the Dorian Spartan second place. Athens sits on the seashore closer to Persia, right on the GNC and obviously can feel that there is a certain danger that might be coming from Persia in any case, just because the Persians keep expanding and they're now sitting right on the Aegean Sea. So for these reasons, and perhaps others maybe were already, I was going to suggest maybe they were already involved with Arrow staggers and the, uh, the rebels of the, the Greek cities of Asia minor because of the democracy, uh, idea. That gives me the suggestion that has been some communication anyway, whether that's true or not, the Athenians vote to send a fleet and soldiers to assist my us and the other cities in their rebellion and they sinned.

Speaker 1:          00:30:15       Well, I'll, I'll come back to how much they send in a moment or auditors decides it's time to make a point. He says, this shows how much easier it is to deceive many people rather than one. Because by his count, and this camp has got to be wrong, there were 30,000 Athenians who were involved in this decision. That's certainly far too many. Um, and they were fooled by aristocracy, whereas King Clay, how many's the one man was not. Um, however that may be what the Athenians wroted was the Sans 20 ships. Now, scholars, some scholars have said only 20 ships. The only is really, I think, a mistake. They are led to that. By knowing that later in the fifth century, the Athenians will end up having 400 triremes. But that's many years later. That's after a victory over the Persians. That's in a totally new world.

Speaker 1:          00:31:14       The best guests I would have now is that the older ships the Athenians had were maybe 50. So sending 20 was not a trivial contribution. Why did they do it? Well, for all the reasons I've suggested, they care about the Ionians, they are their relatives in their own mind. Moreover, they are not very friendly to Persia after the exchanges they have had with the great king in which it's clear, the only way to deal with the great king is to become his subject, something they're not eager to do. Another thing that we need to take into account is that the Athenians remember, at least back to the time of so long and possibly before have been increasingly engaged in trade with the east. That is to say with Asia Minor, with the Hellespont Sea of Marmara, the Bosphorus beyond that, into the Black Sea, in other words, into territory bordering on the Persians so that they have to feel that if the Persians are unfriendly or if the, if the Persians just do what comes naturally to them, they soon may be interfering with things that we need. We increasingly need. The thing is will be increasingly dependent on grain and a fish from those waters. So the, uh, all of that can explain why the Athenians are willing to take this enormously risky decision when the Spartans of course wouldn't think of doing it.

Speaker 1:          00:32:53       Heraclitus has this wonderful phrase to describe the Athenian decision. These ships were the beginning of evils to the Greeks and the barbarians. I guess what he's really saying is here we have the beginning of the Persian wars. My subject, the Ionian rebellion is one thing. Theoretically, if the Athenians had minded their own business and not assisted the rebels, then there need not have been a Persian war. Heaven knows would have come what motive come next. But in any case, I think eroticism is saying once the Athenians decided to participate, assist the rebellion of their relatives in Iowa. This was the beginning of the Persian wars for Athens. Well, the 20th Athenian ships land in my leaders and their soldiers march inland very swiftly and reach the city of Sardis, which is the capital of the sat trappy of Lydia, which is a now a Persian province and are successful in defeating the forces that come out against them and set fire to the city of Sardis.

Speaker 1:          00:34:09       So they've done real harm. Having done that, the Athenians, oh, I forgive me, I've left out in a small but important point. The Athenians were joined by a few ships provided by the city of Eretria, another town in northern Euboea and old time rival and an enemy of, um, uh, what's that other town up there? Uh, just mentioned it a moment ago. It's gone right out of my head. What does anybody remember what town that is? Calico's thank you very much. [inaudible] they're old enemies of calculus and that may account for why very eager to help the Athenians, uh, because the Athenians have defeated kiss and are keeping the child citians down. In any case, they do. A few red trians. 20 ships of Athenians accomplished this deed of, uh, doing considerable harm to the great kings position there and Lydia. Well, now the Persians launch a thorough going expedition with the intention of uh, subduing there Ionian subjects and bringing them back to subjugation.

Speaker 1:          00:35:29       Well, it's not all that easy. This rebellion takes place in for 99. The war against Persia doesn't end until four 94. What the Persians are doing is laying siege to the city's one by one and taking them one by one and then attacking from the sea. And that was critical. If they could defeat the fleets of the Greek cities having already surrounded them on the land side. Those cities were out of business and would have to surrender. And in four, nine before the fleet, but the Persians gathered the Persians of course were landlubbers. They had no navy of their own, but they had a very considerable navy provided by the, uh, Phoenicians, who were among the earliest of the sailors of the eastern Mediterranean, whom this the Persians had conquered. And the Egyptians who had a naval tradition as well. So there was a big Egyptian contingent, a big Phoenician contingent.

Speaker 1:          00:36:38       And when they were under Persian rule, the Ionians provided ships for the great king too. They weren't available right now that we're going to be fighting against the great king. But that's where he got his forces from. They were numerically superior and they were very good sailors and horseman. So finally at the battle of La de la De, uh, off the coast, off the coast that is on the coast of Asia minor, nearby, elitist, the Persians destroyed the fleet of the Greeks and put down the rebellion. And then they took vengeance for the whole thing by laying waste. The city of my Litas entirely burning it to the ground as best one could do that in those days. So the Ionian rebellion has come to an inglorious conclusion. What next? What next is determined in considerable part by the internal affairs of the city of Athens? Do you see meetings?

Speaker 1:          00:37:44       They're going to be the most troubled by what has happened and also they have a reason to be trouble. The great king like I, this is true of most any great empire and the great power that has been attacked or even insulted by some smaller state. You just can't let that go by. You must punish that action to deter similar behavior in the future. So the Athenians had every reason to fear and invasion or some sort of attack from the Persians in the future. I think that is a critical for understanding what's going on in Athens in these years and we do have a few glimpses, just a few glimpses that are difficult to interpret but may possibly make a certain amount of sense. It is interesting. I think that in the year four 96, five, which is to say before the battle of La Day, while the rebellion is still on, uh, the man who was elected the eponymous, our con for that year is hip parkers, the son of Karmas, a relative of the Pi sister kids.

Speaker 1:          00:38:56       And he is precisely the man who tradition says the, the first ostracism was alleged allegedly aimed at what is going on here. Why is the, uh, the uh, bicester it'd hit park us being elected at this point when in fact we know that the Persians have said that they wished to put his relative hippiest back on the throne. Why would the Athenians elect this guy? But he only interpretation makes any sense to me is that you remember that fairy tale I told you last time about the law and ostracism and about how I imagined, um, [inaudible] he's telling him park his, that he could avoid a lot of trouble if he would join up with glycinate. I think he did. And I think his election to the art con ship demonstrates that it's still Kleist in these regime that is in power. If it Parker's gets elected, our con it must be because he's on board.

Speaker 1:          00:39:58       All of this is hypothesis, but it seems to me to make sense. The next event that we hear about an Athens that's relevant to our story is that in the year for 90 see C for 93 the Athenian Tread Gdn franticness presents his play called the capture of my leaders. We don't have the play, but we have stories about it including one neurotic this and what the stories say is that the, the plague showed the scene of the taking of my leaders and the destruction of the city by the Persians and that the play was so moving. The Athenians were made so unhappy by seeing this story that they took measures against the playwright from making them so miserable and find him heavily for doing so. What's that all about? Well, there are various possible interpretations, but I think the one that's most persuasive to me is that phrenic is knew perfectly well, that when he put on this play it would cause great unhappiness and Athens and great anger.

Speaker 1:          00:41:20       I, I think he hoped it would raise anger against the Persians and it would support the idea of the Athenians preparing for war against the Persians, either in the likelihood that the Persians would invade or that the Athenians what has to do something aggressively against Persia somehow. That's, I think that's interpretation that strikes me as being more plausible than other possibilities. But again, it's only a hot pie. I hypothesis in the same year mill tie cities comes back to Athens having traveled from his, uh, home in, uh, the, the, um, deliberate peninsula and uh, he is, think of it for a moment. What's his position going to be? Visa VI Persia. It has to be anti Persian because he has betrayed the king of Persia. He's obviously got a price on his head. If the Persian succeed in putting hippiest on the throne and making Persia boss of Athens, his life isn't worth a nickel.

Speaker 1:          00:42:33       So he's got to be anti Persian. And uh, I think the, um, uh, what happens next has to be understood in terms of the political struggle in Athens in which by no, well not by, oh no by no means were all Athenians convinced that it would be good thing to go to the war against Persia. I mean it's crazy. What I want to communicate to you is the idea of fighting against Persia now is insane. The Persians have conquered most of the known world as far as the Greeks are concerned. They have just bashed their fellow Greeks with without a lot of trouble in Asia Minor. Why would you want to, uh, take these fellows on? What you would want is to avoid conflict with them, to try to find some means of coming to terms with the Persians. I'm sure there must've been Athenians and carotid to says there were, who would have preferred excepting hippiest back as tyrant and having the Persians be the real rulers of their land rather than all getting killed when the Persians decided to come after them.

Speaker 1:          00:43:43       So you've got these two factions, one pro Persian, one anti Persian, and the fact is, apart from hypothesis that mill tighties is brought to trial in Athens. The official charge against him is of having been a tyrant in the, uh, deliberately peninsula when he was in charge of it there. And, uh, he is in fact acquitted of the charge, which may suggest if the jury was influenced by popular opinion and had a political view that the majority of Athenians were not willing to take the tyranny back in any circumstances. And what prepared to fight. Now that the interpretation, again, his hypothesis, the fact of the trial and the acquittal are there another interesting event is that in the year four 93 to [inaudible], that was one big year. That year for 93, uh, miss Stickley's is elected the, uh, our con, the eponymous art con for the year and we shall see that some mystically is, will play a very large role in the great Persian invasion of for 80, and he will be a participant in the battle of marathon to and to, Mister [inaudible] is a great champion of the navy.

Speaker 1:          00:45:07       He has concluded for varieties of reasons that Athens must have a much larger navy then she already has. And he also is obviously a member of that faction that thinks the Persians will becoming and that wishes to be ready and is eager to fight against the Persians. So [inaudible] is on the scene and one of the things he does that looks forward to the rest of his career is that he wants to move the naval base of Athens from Celeron Bay, which is just a beach unfortified completely open to attack if anybody comes. So the Athenian fleet presumably would be drawn up on the sands of the beach at Salieron, uh, where you can go swimming to this very day. Um, add. And if the those ships are up there on the sands, the Persian fleet come sailing up, they're stuck. What he wants to do is what he begins to do to make piracy about five miles up the road into the port of Athens, the naval base of Athens, it has three of its own harvest readily protected.

Speaker 1:          00:46:20       If you build walls around them, if you four to five the piracy, then you have a port that will be secure against an attack and also be a very good base for moving out of. So multidi, excuse me, some mystical ease demonstrates what will be his policy for the rest of his life in regard to Athens and he, the fact that he's chosen our con may be indicative of the mood in Athens, which is increasingly unwilling to accept the idea of a return of hippiest and the Persian rule and is ready to fight about. Well, by now the King of Persia has decided that he must avenge all that has happened and he must go after the people who have done him harm. Athens number one, the little town of Eretria. Number two, he takes a great Persian fleet, uh, accompanied by a great Persian army and starts marching along the Aegean coast, first the wet or the east coast, and then crosses the Hellespont and goes over onto the northern coast.

Speaker 1:          00:47:31       And uh, his, uh, he himself is not doing it is his general mark. Donius is in charge. He conquers the regions of threes and massive don on the north shore of the GNC. Uh, but in four 92, while his fleet is lying off the peninsula that contains Mount Athos, one of those terrible Aegean storms that can come up very suddenly does indeed come up very suddenly and pretty well. Rex, the Persian fleet so serious is the damage that the Persians have to abandon their invasion of Attica, uh, of grease and heading for Athens at this time. At this I should point out is precisely the root the Persians will take for their major invasion in for 80. But for the time being that has been put off thanks to the intervention of the storm or as the Greeks might put it, of the gods.

Speaker 1:          00:48:36       Now as the Persians have actually begun to make their invasion, the Greek cities are aware, the Persians are coming, the Persians are coming. And the question is what to do. Well, the island of Regina, which is unfriendly to Athens, you remember from way back, they decide we're not going to be swept away with the Athenians. When the Persians get here and they give earth and water to the king, they have in fact become Persian subjects at this point. [inaudible] changes his mind. He does not want to sit there quietly while the Persians come and invade Greece. And so he now goes to the island of vagina, takes hostages, delivers the hostages to the Athenians, and in so doing creates a rapprochement between Sparta and Athens. And now the Spartans and the Athenians are allies. That doesn't mean the Athenians have joined the Peloponnesian League. They just establish friendly relations after being at odds for such a period of time.

Speaker 1:          00:49:45       And there is a quarrel between the two kings is, as I've told you, and it's at this time, that demo radius is sent into exile and clay nominees himself comes out very badly. So both kings will be in some degree of disgrace at the time of the battle of marathon. Oh, let us turn them to the Persian invasion that culminates in the battle of men of marathon. The purpose is very simple, sorry to punish those cities that have insulted and damage the great King Athens and a retro to restore hippies to the tyranny and Athens and where from where he can serve as the kings cetera and surely also to gain a foothold in Greece on the way to conquering all of Greece. Why should they want to conquer all of Greece? Hurghada this tells a story about his relative and tells him, for God's sake, what do you want to go to?

Speaker 1:          00:50:51       Greece? There's nothing there, but a lot of rocks. What is the point of conquering the place? It's one thing to conquer wallabies. Rich places Egypt Babylonia. That's fine. This welfare, there's huge populations is a lot of good stuff. It's just Greeks and rocks. Why in the world you want to go there? And the answer I think in part would be a Sir Edmund Hillary is answer because they're there. And that's part of the answer because you know we must understand that the ancient idea, in fact, I'm willing to say the idea that dominated thinking about such matters right down probably into the 19th century in many cases, but certainly before the advent of Christianity was this. That conquest is good. It's good to be strong, it's good to be rich, it's good to be powerful. Therefore it's got to be stronger, richer and more powerful. And if there's somebody on your frontier, take them over, and that by the way, will make you still more glorious because conquest his glory.

Speaker 1:          00:51:59       Now we in the west, that's not our natural attitude. Our natural attitudes shaped and considerable part, whatever your religious association may be by Christianity, which has been the dominant force in shaping people's thinking in the west, whatever, as I say, whatever religion you belong to and that aspect of Christianity that it violates is the one that's increasingly the one that's emphasized by Christians. And that is the sermon on the mountain, the one that says the meek shall inherit the earth. It's not the strong and tough and so, and the one that says, if your enemy strikes you, turn the other cheek so he can strike you there too. Now, if the Greeks had heard that, they would've said, these people are lunatics, send them away. Week morality said, be good to your friend, do good to your friends and harm to your enemies. And the second part is just as important as the first part.

Speaker 1:          00:53:00       So you need to understand that the sort of the ethical underpinnings to all of our natural thinking and in the West are as odd and strange and crazy as they can be for everybody else in the human race. So far as I can see, there are exceptions. I'm, I'm missing some, uh, eastern religions which have ideas that are not altogether and ask them to what I'm saying. But what I'm trying to say is nobody in the ancient world would have ever had such an idea. Of course, if you can conquer somebody who is your neighbor, you do. And so there was every reason to know that the, the Persians were coming. Um, how many, we don't know. The estimate that most people would accept is somewhere between 20 and 30,000 infantry men. So for the sake of splitting the difference, I always assume something like 25,000 infantry men and some cavalry.

Speaker 1:          00:54:06       That's very important. Even though the capillary does not play any part in the actual battle of marathon, but Herat it, this makes it very clear that there was a Persian cavalry that the Persians picked the site of marathon to fight in, in part because it was a good place for cavalry to fight. So there's a Persian cavalry on board the ships anyway, alongside the infantry, the two Persian generals, our datas and Arthur Fernie's, um, they have with them. Hippiest hippiest of course, must've been all these years urging the great king to make some such a campaign. And he probably would have said, and marathon is the place to land. Do you remember that's the territory of the Pi's district heads. That's where pie sister this landed on his last, uh, return to Athens when he made himself Tyron. That's where his people, where, that's where his forces with gather.

Speaker 1:          00:55:03       I'm sure hippie has said what all such exiles always say, all I need do is set foot on the beach at marathon and my people will rise up as one and join me. You won't even have to fight in Athens because there'll be so glad to see me back. This is what King James, I'm sure told Louie the 14th is about getting back to England. Then one, here's that all the time. Uh, but it's a very important part of this story. I don't think we can understand what happens at marathon if we don't know that everybody thought it was highly possible that there were Athenians who were eager to restore hippy as to the throne and would be willing to engage in treasonous activities or to defect from the democracy and join it be as if the circumstances were appropriate. So that's in the back of everybody's mind.

Speaker 1:          00:56:00       They were in the front. I think when the Persians got there, their strategy included the belief that there would be treason in Athens that would turn the city over to them if the circumstances were right. So that forced starts this time, not, not, not along the coast. As I told you last time, it takes the shortest route directly across the hopping from island to island, stops it in that sauce. Member Nexus in Noida King by successfully resisting are staggering, is a invasion and they destroy next sauce. Next they come to the island of deloss in the middle of the Aegean, the island sacred to Apollo and his sister artimus a very sacred place indeed for the Greeks. What to the versions? Do they treat the arc? I'm not the article, but they treat the deacons and the priests of Apollo, the loss with great respect, do them no harm.

Speaker 1:          00:56:59       This is typical Persian conquest. They do not impose religions. Their religion is different from that of most of the others in this area. They are Zoroastrians. They are sun worshipers of a certain con. Uh, and uh, but they don't impose their religion. They don't interfere with their religion. They get a very nice writeup in the Old Testament, if you remember, because they don't mistreat the Hebrews and they particularly don't do them, uh, in compelled them to abandon their own religious practices as the other invaders do. So what is, uh, what, what are the Persians saying by these actions? They are saying we are not at war with the Greek gods. We're not even at war with the Greeks. We are simply punishing these two Ms Korean towns that have attacked us.

Speaker 1:          00:57:55       They then turn to the southern tip of the island of Euboea to the town of characters. The persons may be not at war with the Greeks, but they expect all Greeks or along the way to behave the way they're supposed to, to the great king. And so they asked the Corinthians to give Earth and water they're Corinthians refuse and the Persians, oh, obliterate. Uh, but their city and take their people into slavery. Now they push their way, take their sale along the coast of Euboea to Eretria in the north east. And now here are 4,000 Athenians settled there. Remember? In a clarification. So right. They, uh, get their armor on and they stand in front and a prepared to dub die fighting for the freedom of Eretria because of their wonderful friendship to Athens. Wrong. The 4,000 Athenians go home to Attica. Why? Well, I suppose the immediate answer is why not?

Speaker 1:          00:59:00       But the, it's an embarrassment and Hirata at this, I think we have to realize is very friendly to Athens all throughout his own history. I doubt that there's, I mean, there's no doubt that he spent time in Athens. He seems to have been a friend of Paraclese in later years. He was kindly, although he himself comes from helicopter Nassis in Asia Minor, but he did, he did spend a lot of time in Athens and uh, there seems to be a pro Athenian cast. One thing also is that many of his, um, sources were Athenians who told the story their way. So their answer was the Athenians were ready to fight to save Eretria but the retro Ian said is no point. Why should you get killed too? It's not your town. Why don't you go home if you can believe that you can believe anything. But I don't.

Speaker 1:          00:59:53       I think the Athenians realized there was nothing but disaster. If they stayed in, they could believe if we get back to Attica, we might be able to make a contribution to defending our city. Okay, so now here they are at Eretria, the Athenians are gone. It's time for the invasion, the site of the battle. Where do they go? Well, they picked marathon as I say, in part because it's very near Eretria. Secondly, as a Herata says, because it's a good place for cavalry. Thirdly, as I've already told you, because it's the stronghold of Pi Sisters, the place which would be natural for an army trying to establish hippiest on the throne of that. That's why they're there. And their plan I think is to go to marathon. If the Pussy Athenians come out and challenge them to a fight, they will crush the Athenians. But they didn't expect that.

Speaker 1:          01:00:46       They thought the Athenians would be afraid, but, and that what would happen is they would stay there in marathon until they got the news that there was a revolution in Athens, prepare to turn the city over to them. That's what hit me is I think led them to believe in. That's what they hoped for. They were prepared to fight of course, but they thought it wouldn't be necessary. So on August the fourth, they land in the year for 90 at marathon. We know these dates because there are, uh, uh, as an eclipse associated with this, which allows astronomers to fix it pretty precisely. The Athenians of course, when they knew that the Persians were coming and that news would have come to them, the minute they got to Mac sauce, then ships would have come to Athens. So the seniors were well worn, went to their new friends, Sparta to ask them for help.

Speaker 1:          01:01:44       Of course. And this is where a wonderful stories they sent. The great runner who's named comes down to us in the manuscripts as five [inaudible]. Chances are his real name was Phillip cities, but there was an error in the manuscript, but we'll call him five deputies cause that's what the manuscripts say. And uh, he um, he races to Sparta as fast as he could go. Took them less than two days where he came to the Spartans and he said, the Persians are coming, the Persians are coming. Please help us. The Spartan. We would love to come and help you. Nothing would please us more. Unfortunately, we are in the midst of our holy religious ceremony that cornea and we are not allowed until to leave our hometown until the next full moon, which is a matter of fact, is the night of August 11th, 12th. In other words, a whole week after the, the Persians are going to land, I can't go speculating as to what are we to make of this?

Speaker 1:          01:02:51       Is this me? Is this just an excuse of the Spartan series about this? Our tendency, I suppose being modern and cynical would be to say it's only an excuse. I'm more inclined to think that they were sincere about it. It's not that they couldn't find ways to get round such things, but they really took their religion quite seriously. And it may be that, uh, uh, you know, that did play a role, be that as it may two things that the Athenians now know, they know the Spartans have promised to come, but not for another week. Both of those things should be, uh, on your minds as you try to understand. Now, [inaudible] says that the Athenian army marched out from Athens and went to marathon, and then they had an argument about what they should do. But I don't think that's right. There must have been a debate.

Speaker 1:          01:03:42       There had to be a debate in Athens. You couldn't take an army out of town without having an assembly to argue the question, should we send an army? And if we should send an army, how big should the army be? And having that decided that who should be in command. All those things had to be settled by the assembly in Athens. So that's where the debate took place. Some favored defending the city of Athens. Now we don't know how well the city of Athens was walled, defended by fortification at this time in its history. It may not have had any wall, but I'd be surprised. But it certainly did not have a wall that was guaranteed to be effective against an attack. And so I think we should understand that is not going to be successful to stay home and defend the Athens means to allow the Persians to run all around Attica doing anything they want, causing all the harm.

Speaker 1:          01:04:45       They could remember something over 75% maybe as many as 90% of the Athenians had farms out in the country. Now the houses out in the country that would have been exposed to the Persians, and so there was good reason for them not to think that was a great idea. The alternative was to send an army out to allow the Persians to land because they couldn't stop it. They didn't know where the Persians were going to come, but as soon as they heard that the Persians had landed to send an army there and meet them at the place of landing mill. Tinies emerges as the leading figure here. Not because, I mean he is in general, but that's not the only reason. It's because everybody knows mill [inaudible] is the resident Persian expert. He has been a general in the Persian army. And so that gives him a come, a reason to be listened to.

Speaker 1:          01:05:40       But he's obviously also a person of great merit and quality proves it at the battle of marathon. Uh, he must've been an impressive fellow. So for all these reasons, whatever his formal position was, and I think it was simply one of the generals de facto, he had much more influence than others for these reasons. And his argument was let us go out and meet the Persians where they land and the reasons where we, we don't want them to be able to get to the Spartans. But beyond that, there was fear that if we stay home and wait and let the Persians do whatever they're going to do every day, that passes increases the danger of treason from those people who want to turn the city over. Um, and it's also so completely against the ethic of the Greek warrior. And I would say more specifically the hoplite warrior.

Speaker 1:          01:06:41       You don't let your enemy ravage your countryside. You don't let them destroy your farm. This in a way, goes all the way back to, to homer, the notion of RFA. A man must have courage. He must stand up against an enemy who invades his country. And then again beyond that, you move to the world of the hoplite and you're talking about defending your homestead. All of that argument for going out there. So, uh, the terminology I would use for modern terminology to explain what the Athenian, that strategy was to go out and to contain the beachhead, go out, confront us Persians where they are, don't let them get inland from where they landed. So they do land at marathon with about 2,500 infantry. And I remember their infantry are not hoplites, they do not have heavy armor. There are pictures on a wonderful paintings on vases. Yes sir.

Speaker 1:          01:07:45       I meant thousand, I hope by yeah, thanks very much. Um, there, there are visas that showed the Persian soldiers at marathon and they are wearing a pants as I told you. But then at carrying any, uh, they're not wearing any armor and their, their shield is a kind of a wicker shield so that their armament is much inferior to the hoplites. And keep in mind too that the Persian army is always made up of a collection of subject peoples. Yes, there will be some Persian, but there will also be a lots of folks who are not Persians in there. So they lacked that unity that the Greeks, we'll have

Speaker 2:          01:08:30       the, excuse me, I got this thing a little backwards. Well, nevermind. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:08:45       mealtime. Andy's plan is this, there are something like 10,000 Greeks about 9,000. That's ain't aliens. About a thousand are veterans against, let us say 25,000 Persians. And so, uh, as the thing begins, the map here shows you the rough picture of the field at marathon here. The Persians landed right here and had their ships drawn up at this place. They had their camp behind here. This Marshall, would it be a little bit more over this way? It's a very serious, Marsha will play an important role in what happens. The Greeks come out, they'd probably bully. Came marching in through this way. And here we have mountains. This wavy line indicates the line of the mountains. Here you have a really flat plane, but here you have mountains. And somewhere up on the hills here, there was the Greek camp near them. Modern Church of Saint Demetrius. This little dot reflects the mound where the dead, the Greek dead at marathon will after the battle be buried.

Speaker 1:          01:09:52       And that is likely to be about the place with a main fighting took place, which helps us to place where the actual battle took place. So the, the idea of the, uh, of the, uh, Athenians was to try to hold him there as long as they could. But the Greeks have the upper hill, the Persians are down below. If the Persians want to start a fight, then they ought to come that they will have to come running up the hill. Well, that is not a very attractive proposition. And so the Greeks feel, let them come for us. It's our country. They're sitting here on the thing. They've got to do something. We don't. Meanwhile, the Persians are waiting for treason. So if the city will be surrendered to them, a week goes by with the two sides looking at each other and doing nothing. I always like to compare the Athenian strategy to an old fashioned football strategy, which I haven't seen done now in decades, which used to be kick on first down and wait for a fumble.

Speaker 1:          01:11:05       In other words, let give the ball to the Persians and let them make a mistake. Uh, I think that's what was in mill tighties mind. Well, time passes and the Persians realize we can't sit there forever. For one thing, they're going to run out of food and water for another thing. The great king will want to hear something. Well, how'd you do? What did you do? We sat there and watched the these scenes. No good. So the plan that the Persians made, I think was this, that they would take, let us say for the sake of argument, 10,000 troops, put them on the ships, load up the cavalry with, uh, onto the ships to and send those ships around Attica to come up to fallow on bay, straight into Athens. And meanwhile, take the 15,000 that are left, March them up too close, as close as you could get to the Greeks and fix the Greeks there so that they can't go back and defend, uh, Athens.

Speaker 1:          01:12:08       So there's no army to protect assets. So if those guys get off the ships, come sailing into the harbor, walk up to town, it's theirs. If the Athenians are crazy enough from the Persian point of view to come running down the hill or walking down the hill of whatever into, to be outnumbered three to two by us in any way are Persians, we always beat Greeks. We've got nothing to worry about, then, uh, let him do it. So they come now [inaudible] he's in charge on the day of the battle, he's got the problem that they have 5,000 more troops than he has. He's worried about being outflanked. So what each decides to do is to weaken the depths of his line because he must cover the length of the Persian line. Well, the danger with that is of course, that when they hit each other, the Persians will break through the Greek lines.

Speaker 1:          01:13:05       So instead of making it even, he loaded up the wings and left the center even weaker than it would otherwise have been. His hope and strategy was that the Athenians would win on the wings before the Persians could break through the middle and then the Athenians could turn on the center of the Persians and to feed them and just barely. That's what happened. The Persians did break through the center, but it was too late. By that time, the Greek wing, the Athenian Wings were successful and drove the Persians before them. The Persians ran away like mad, but they ran into the great swamp and that made their escape much more difficult. So the Athenians were able to kill great numbers of them. And finally that that battle was over and now the battle was over. Let's imagine that it took a couple of hours. That would be a long time.

Speaker 1:          01:14:00       The Athenians had time now to have a meal, take a little rest and March back across to Attica, which ad before the ships could get there. And I like to imagine the scene when it all happened. The Persians coming around the last bend of the bay as they coming to Fowler on expecting to see a nice empty beach and seeing the Athenian army. I liked them. Imagine with their left foot in the breakers and their shields up in there, uh, spears up with the sun gleam off their shields and blinding the Persians as they came. And at which point you can't force a landing against an army just can't be done in the ancient world. These guys had to go home and start thinking about what they're going to tell the great king. The Athenians won the battle. Very large, very large, uh, casualties for the Persians.

Speaker 1:          01:15:03       Only 192 Greeks killed in the battle and allowed the extraordinary honor of, um, being buried on the field where they bet have fought. Next Day, 2000 Spartans come marching into Attica that proves they were serious and were told what had happened. They asked permission, can we go to the battlefield and look at it? And there they saw all these dead Persians and no one had ever seen anything like that. No Greeks that ever beat Persians before. And Great was the glory of the Athenians. So I've described very inadequately in to swiftly. The battle was so what? What is the significance of this silly little Babel, 10,000 Greeks against the 15,000 Persians back a billion years ago? What does it matter? And Lots of folks will tell you that, especially these days, but I remember in 1936, there was a, a wonderful conference of pacifists, uh, who met in England at which the dominant theme of the speakers was no war ever made any difference. What I like about that was that the place of the meeting was Hastings.

Speaker 1:          01:16:23       The battle was seen throughout the rest of Greek history. First of all is a great victory for hoplites as opposed to their opponents in, in later Greek history. When the navy, when the Athenian history, when the navy becomes a big thing, it is the, the party, the old fashioned and more conservative party that thinks about marathon as the great victory that day that those hoplite farmers saved Greece, the navy guys, the poor like to think about Salomon, the naval battle in for Haiti, it was seen as a victory for democracy. It was the Athenian Democrats later on. I'm sure there were glad the per the Spartans never got there because they could claim it as their own and as a victory for democracy as well. It was also the first, as I say, Greek defeat of the Persians as Hurghada and says for up until then, even the name of Persians was a fearful thing for Greeks to here.

Speaker 1:          01:17:23       It was the source of tremendous national pride and glory for Athens and scholars have compared the impact of the battle of marathon on the Athenian image of themselves with the defeat of the Spanish armada by Elisabeth's English fleet, uh, and the beginning of the glory of the Elizabethan era. It was seen as a victory for freedom because the price of the feet would have been slavery in every sense as they understood it. Greek civilization, and I'll come back to this in a minute, could have been strangled in it's infancy because it is in its infancy, but again, we ought to pay attention to those people who suggest that people like me are over embellishing the significance of all this. One English statesman said, war wins, nothing cures, nothing settles nothing. Speaker was Neville Chamberlain and 90 36 Bertrand Russell philosophy declared disarmament and complete pacifism is indisputably the wisest policy and he urged the gradual disbanding of the British Army, navy and air force as Hitler was moving into the Rhineland.

Speaker 1:          01:18:47       Does victory in war make a difference? I would say as the losers, the victims and the survivors of the Holocaust ask the descendants of the slaves in the American south. Remember this, if the Athenians had lost at Marathon East Golez had just begun his career as a playwright. Sophocles hadn't written a play. Your deputies of course hadn't either, nor had Aristophanes Socrates pick up this, right? Yeah. Socrates wasn't born yet, much less Plato, Aristotle, Phineas. There was no Parthenon. None of those glorious buildings that we make us think about. The greatness that was Greece had been constructed. There would be no democracy because this was the only place where it had any existence. The scientific revolution, which was almost in beyond, beyond it's infancy in terms of being new, uh, would have been wiped out. There would be no memory. There would be no record of any of this, and therefore no Western civilization, no political freedom for all these have occurred in no other culture in all the years since that time. That's why I wanted you to know a little bit about the battle of Marathon, because I think all of us alive today here, oh, a very great debt to the 10,000 marathoner Mccoy, the fighters of marathon, who fought for Greek freedom and for hours too.
