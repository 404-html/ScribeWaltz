Speaker 1:          00:00:01       We have been looking at the question of the rise of the Poles and the various significant elements that were part of the making of the poles. And of course I've emphasized the notion of this new class of people the former hotplate citizen as being the critical element in shaping the poles and for my money. That's what the Poles is about to start with. And then it develops characteristics consistent with that and some that challenge that over the centuries. But now imagine that we are living in the early years of the poles sometime in the 8th century B.C.. Again I want to emphasize these things that I've been describing don't happen every place at the same time and they don't even happen every place in the same way. But over a stretch of time the concepts and the kind of characteristics I've been describing appear to spread all over the place.

Speaker 1:          00:01:12       But one of the ways in which we can date the time when the Poles came into being has to do with the Greek traditions about the establishment of colonies throughout the Mediterranean inhabited by Greeks and the reason that they are a clue is because every time we see a colony learn anything at all about it it appears to exist in the form of a polis which powerfully suggests that that was the sort of the typical characteristic style of life that had already been established for Greeks before they sent out colonies. So that's the chronological significance of it all I should say.

Speaker 2:          00:02:02       All of these dates that I will be giving you are some combination of Greek tradition and the Greeks dated many in many cases they dated these colonies very specifically. That would be hard to believe impossible to believe I guess. If it weren't that these dates tended to be confirmed in a general way not in a specific way by the archeological discoveries that we find at the sites the earliest places where these colonies came into being.

Speaker 1:          00:02:40       So it's that combination archaeology plus Greek tradition that lies behind the date of any city. But you shouldn't take the date that I give you the traditional date as being firm. It's a general thing it's around that time is the best we can really say to date.

Speaker 2:          00:02:58       That's sort of typical for the general phenomenon of colonisation coming out of the mother cities of Greece is again that date we keep talking about 750 roughly. But in fact the earliest date according to Greek tradition if my memory is correct was something like seven seventy three where the Greeks date the foundation of what they thought was the earliest colony they ever established place that they called Perfect Koussa which we call it's the island of SGA in the Bay of Naples. That's the very first place where there is a tradition of a Greek colony having been planted. There's no question that there was a Greek colony there and and as I say the archaeological remains confirm the general time for this happening.

Speaker 1:          00:03:54       Now the first question I suppose is but before I get to describing what a colony was and how it worked.

Speaker 3:          00:04:02       We want to ask the question What was it that led Greeks to sail or walk most of this sail very great distances from their mother cities to leave home and to establish a new city for themselves someplace else. That is not to be taken for granted in the first place by until the twentieth century I guess human beings tended to stay put. They didn't move unless they were driven to move. That was the natural thing to do given the character of life which was based upon farming. If you leave you lose your farm based upon the difficulty of transportation in the Greek world we know I think I quoted something from he that confirm it.

Speaker 4:          00:04:54       The Greeks were even though they went to see plenty they were terrified of the sea for a very good reason their ships their boats were not very seaworthy. Storms come up in the Mediterranean very suddenly and terribly. You take your life in your hands when you travel. So then there is the whole idea you know we've already given you some sense that the Greeks were ancestor worshippers. I mean they took special care of the dead and they thought that the way you buried people and so on was terribly important.

Speaker 2:          00:05:24       And so what I'm saying is when you leave the place where you were born you will leave your ancestors as well. All of that means we need to explain why these folks do what they end up doing and we have some hints but of course we do not know with any certainty or any confidence.

Speaker 3:          00:05:46       If you ask the question why did many Italians leave their home especially south Italians in the late 19th century and come well go all over the world actually South America Australia. But the largest numbers to the United States. Why did they do that. Well we don't have to do a lot of guessing. We have written evidence from the people who went and they say why they did it. We can then supplement that with all sorts of other information that we have but we don't have any documents from some settler explaining why he's going where he's going. So we have to reason from the evidence that the establishment gives us. I suppose the most widely cited reason is simply the desire to acquire farmland remember. I keep emphasizing this the vast overwhelming majority of people needed to farm land in order to stay alive. And why should there be a shortage of farm land. One answer and that's the one that is most widely believed among Greek scholars is that the growth of population that we have mentioned in connection with the rise of the poles is still working. Once the Poles comes into form and so what. What this means if you are producing. If you have used to had two children and now you have four. How do you provide for the extra two.

Speaker 2:          00:07:26       Well you know some. Sometimes you divide up the land equally but if that land continues to get smaller and smaller it will not sustain an additional person. Not to mention additional family. If you were to follow the procedure which the Greeks did not of primogeniture that is of giving the whole plot to the eldest son. But what happens to the others. And so that clearly is a problem.

Speaker 3:          00:07:52       And the notion that land hunger is a key explanation I think is supported by the fact that wherever we find a pulse whatever other characteristics it has and they vary some of them are located at wonderful places on the sea for trading purposes some of them are not but all of them have a land supply which permits the citizens to farm successfully and thereby to keep the make the polis succeed. But I don't think that's the only answer. I think that desire for commerce would have been also I agree with the traditional view which is that this would've been a lesser consideration but still very important because we so often find. That the colony is placed right out of a nifty place for trade and they would have had to be damn fools to have several there without that being in their mind. So although some of the places where they settled leave us puzzled and it left the ancients puzzled.

Speaker 3:          00:09:07       One of my favorite example is the colony on the south shore of the Bosporus which is called Chelsea then Calcutta on whichever way you want to do it. It's right opposite Constantinople and no constant. That doesn't exist. Istanbul Winston Churchill never never conceded that it was Istanbul. He called it Constantinople to the day he died. But right opposite that magnificent sight the Golden Horn is there. How could you possibly settle there because they settled Chelsea then first and the tradition that the Greeks pass on is the people who settle Chelsea on war blind men because you would have to be blind to make that choice. But we don't know why they did what they did.

Speaker 5:          00:10:00       So but nonetheless the desire for a good commercial opportunity might well have been one of the elements that these people who were leaving their home cities sought. And then there are less. What's the word I want. Certainly things that have nothing to do with economics really. We always there are always there were politics going on in these states as there always are. In any Greek polls there are factions that grow up for one reason or another. They come into conflict. One side wins the argument and the battle and sometimes the ill will is so great that the losing fought side feels either that it has to flee for its safety or that it chooses to flee rather than to live under their opponents. And so you would have. Defeated political groups might well or individuals who were the heads of those groups might decide they have to get out of town and now that we do have something this wave of colonization they join that as well. And then there are always things that we might call much less rational than that.

Speaker 6:          00:11:13       In any group of people. There is a small minority I want to emphasize small who'd just love to do risky things they just love adventure. They're never happy if they're safe. And so off to go seeking adventure and seeking to make a fortune however they're going to do it. So I think that has to be counted into the picture too. So typically I think it would have been a small part of what's going on. So for these reasons and probably for a hundred more that I haven't thought of. We can understand why these people go against the natural instinct of staying put and go of adventuring out seeking a new home someplace in the Mediterranean. OK.

Speaker 5:          00:12:02       What are these new settlements like. First thing is that they're like each other in many important ways although obviously with differences from place to place. But here's how it works by the way. The word I have been using colony is not a Greek word and really not appropriate for what the Greeks are up to. The Greek word for this is up or a key out and most literally it would mean a home away and away home. And that's what they're making they're re-establishing themselves a household a home someplace away from where they started. And that's the name colony is a Latin word ultimately for colonia and the Roman colonies were first of all garrisons that they planted in land they had conquered to keep the people quiet. So they would be alien bosses in a different territory. And then later in history in Roman history that was the name given to establishment rural establishments.

Speaker 3:          00:13:12       When the civilization was breaking down and they had and the men who worked on those rural places really were not free men and were the antecedents of the service. We will see later on in medieval history in Europe. So when you see the word colonia in late Roman history it's talking about something very very different from what we're talking about. So. I use the word count because that's what we have for all such establishments of the kind we're talking about but I remember that these are appoint key from the Greek point of view. OK. How does an upward Keya happen somebody in one of the old Greek cities has to decide that he wants to go out and establish a colony. He would be an individual of some eminence because the job of doing this requires that people should accept. His leadership. He will have to do the recruiting of people that come with him on the colony.

Speaker 2:          00:14:29       He will have to do the constitutional discussion and political discussion to gain the sanction from the mother city to allow him to do everything he knows. So I think we should imagine that these colonies these leaders of colonies these founders of colonies would be probably noblemen and that they would have a position of eminence but and yet. Unlikely to be part of the sort of dominant faction in that city because otherwise why would they leave anyway. The Greeks had a name for this individual. He was called an OI c'est states. He is the founder of the colony so now he has decided to do it and he's gained recognition from the town council let's say. And he can go forward. Now he has to have an idea. He did. He can't just say I think I'd like to found a colony but is more typical I think is that he thinks I would like to take and I've found a colony on the south eastern coast of Sicily Y.

Speaker 3:          00:15:44       Because he knows something about it. Either he has somehow traveled out there himself and said take the place. I'm thinking about. Has a wonderful harbor. It has good farmland in the neighborhood. A critical element to making this judgment is it is not occupied by hostile natives who will resist vigorously. Your landing there either there will be nobody there or more likely there will be not a very big population and it's not very tough. And they could be easily brushed aside those would have been some of the considerations. And so what the orchestra is does when he has picked out in his own mind where he wants to go next he goes to Delphi anybody. You raise your hand if you've been to Delphi Yeah well it's when you go to Greece do the obvious go where the tourists go. And Delphi is one place not to miss it's halfway up Mount Parnassus.

Speaker 3:          00:16:47       And it was thought by the Greeks to be the on fellows. The navel of the universe the center in every way. Why. Because they're the God Apollo had established a an oracle. There were there was a place in which from the earth there came a star wasn't steam what it was. What would it be gases would escape through this gap in the earth and there when things got figured out and arranged and there were priests who worshiped Apollo there and who took care of this phenomenon. There was if they would place a young woman there who would sit. As these gases came up. And she would. After a while begin to I suppose in the biblical languages she would speak in tongues which is to say she would rattle off a lot of language which nobody could understand what she was saying gibberish or so it sounded or Greek making no sense to anybody. And then the priest would listen to this stuff and he would say Ah what Apollo said through the priest is here is. And he would give the message let me just take a moment to tell you about this I say this now with great confidence.

Speaker 2:          00:18:11       But ten years ago this story which all the Greeks agreed to have agreed upon in every respect the temple of Apollo was built right on top of this underneath the floor of the temple was this little room where the gases came up with a priest who sat through all of this came up. Well archaeologists investigated this carefully the French school of archaeology late in the 19th century dug everything up and concluded this was baloney. It was a myth.

Speaker 7:          00:18:40       There were no gases coming up from any of this stuff. And. So everybody believed for the next century and then a young man who once sat in one of the chairs not in this room maybe but that in which you're sitting. John Hale of the Yale class of nineteen seventy three who is now an archaeologist at the University of Louisville having learned or having agreed let's say with my prejudice which is that the higher now used Hey must reign. And if the Greeks said it happened you got to believe it happened until you have to believe that it didn't happen. And so we decided to investigate this and he took with him a fine geologist from Wesleyan and justice to go to the place there at Delphi and to see whether it could be true that such gases did come out. And what sort of gases they were and what consequences they would have. And you know I wouldn't be telling you this story if it hadn't turned out that they discovered evidence that in my judgment. But I don't think really anybody doubts it anymore. Totally confirmed the Greek story. I can tell you precisely what the gases were. What the characteristics of those gases were squared beautifully with all the tales that we heard about the Delphic oracle.

Speaker 3:          00:20:12       So here's just one more case where Yale helped to straighten out the world. But you notice it wasn't done by Yale faculty member we we engage in confusing the world but our alumni do a much better job and that's what happened here. So. So you go to the Oracle and what do you say. What do you ask the oracle. Well now before we go any further you will in your Herodotus readings and elsewhere you will come across many a story in which an Oracle is consulted and gives an answer. Well the most famous early on King Croesus of Lydia the richest man in the world you've heard all about him decides it would be a nice thing to conquer the Persian empire his neighbor to the east and so he goes to the east a barbarian but the barbarians came to the Delphic Oracle to because you want to know what the gods want.

Speaker 3:          00:21:05       So he came and he asked. He said if I if I cross the Halley's River that's the boundary between Libya and Persia what will happen and the Oracle replied. A great empire will be destroyed. And presses it. Terrific. That's what I have in mind. He invaded he was clobbered. And then you read a splendid story about it just tells of how here he was captured. He was up on a pyre. He was going to be burned when he remembered so long. The Greek would come to him and warned him about this vain glory. And he said oh so long and oh so long and I guess Apollo must have then said Ah he's read. He's reached wisdom and so he sent a rainstorm to put the fire out and he lived through that. Well OK. But the point is the Oracle was wrong. No of course not. We all know what was wrong with creases. He should have asked another question which empire but didn't think of it.

Speaker 4:          00:22:09       Other times you know all kinds of funny stories told about the Oracle which would suggest that it wasn't really a very reliable source of information that it was filled with knowledge mythology and so on and so forth. But here it is the hard headed fact we know for sure Greeks and barbarians and everybody came to Delphi when you came to Delphi and you were going to consult the oracle. It was hard. A lot of people a long line. So there was a waiting issue but also people used to bribe the priest in order to get up more more upfront online and they would also give great and beautiful gifts to the temple people and to the temple and to the priest. And in other words people spent a lot of money to consult the oracle. Now ask yourself this especially you're talking about Greeks are they going to keep shelling out money for an oracle that gives them answers that turn out to be wrong.

Speaker 3:          00:23:05       No. Most of the things they asked were questions that really had a yes or no answer. And according according to my thinking there's no way they could have been wrong very much. And I think the Oracle probably gained its fame for being very good at precisely at answering this question. The question would have been what will happen if I go and try to settle a colony at the place which I will call Syracuse. That's what I've been describing on the southeastern coast of Sicily. And the answer would come back and the priests would give a response that would be essentially straight. It would either say something like I'm not going to do the words that they would have come up with but they would have said yep that's a good place to go. And if or no don't do that. That's a terrible mistake. Now why would they be able to do that. Because at some point in here Delphi really did become the navel of the universe. Everybody came.

Speaker 4:          00:24:10       Now you can bet when these folks came and consulted the priest and said Could you please put us down on the list we want to consult the oracle. The priest said sure have a beer. Let's talk about your hometown.

Speaker 7:          00:24:20       What's going on out there. What I'm suggesting to you that this was the best information gathering and storing device that existed in the Mediterranean world.

Speaker 3:          00:24:31       These people knew more than anybody else about these things. And so consulting that Oracle was a very rational act indeed. OK. Now suppose you are annoyed orchestrates you've gotten the permission from your city to go forward. You go to the Delphic Oracle and the other car says fine. By all means go where you want to go. Next thing you've got to go home and you have to write up what amounts to a charter of foundation for the city which lays out how things are going to work in this city. Something about the governmental structure maybe even more fundamentally how the land will be a lot of assigned divided and so on so that when you go to recruit settlers everybody will know what he's getting and we'll decide whether it's it's a good idea for him or not. Now recruiting is tremendously important because you need to have.

Speaker 3:          00:25:36       A certain number of settlers to make the settlement viable. You may not run into. An enormously powerful collection of natives but you're gonna get some kind of trouble. It's foolish for you to assume you're not going to have any problem out there so you need a certain number of people just for defense purposes. But beyond that you need to have a certain number of people to carry out all the functions that need to be carried out for a successful post. So however many that is that is what you try to recruit and you recruit typically it would be at a time when it's easy to get people together so you can tell them the story. And the best time would be at some great festival. There are festivals held in each city just for its own citizens. And my guess is that when you could do that when you felt that you could recruit a full colony from your fellow citizens in Corinth let us say.

Speaker 3:          00:26:38       That's what you did. But it would often happen that there were not enough Corinthians who were ready to go with you on your expedition so you would try to have to take your message to one of the pan hellenic festivals which were getting organized about this time as you know the Olympic Games are alleged to have started in 1776. So that would be a place where Greeks from all over might come and you could then try to recruit settlers for your new colony there. And we don't know precisely when but there were important pan hellenic games at near Corinth the isthmus in games that were pan hellenic games at Delphi and there were a pan hellenic games in the north eastern Peloponnese at a town called Noumea. So. There would always be some opportunity for you to go out and make your pitch so now you have everything in place you've recruited your settlements you get on your ships and sail. In this case out to the western West Central Mediterranean you find your way to Sicily work your way into the harbor at Syracuse. And things work out. And now we have this boy Keya called Syracuse so the next question I think is what is the relationship between Syracuse which is the outpost here and the end currents which is the main topless the metropolis the mother city. That's what metropolis means by the way.

Speaker 3:          00:28:27       First thing to brush from your mind along with the word colony as we have used it in modern times is the notion that. The city of Syracuse would send out a colony controlled owns the city of Syracuse which it has sent out. This is not the case. But before they get the British gave Hong Kong back Hong Kong was a Crown Colony. It was British territory. The Brit was ruled by Britain. And so on. No this is not what an eye here is from the first Syracuse is an independent policy autonomous self-governing whatever regime it wants et cetera. It is not a subject of anybody not Corinth or anybody else.

Speaker 3:          00:29:24       But that's not the end of the story. The question really is. So now we know that what kind of relations did they have. I would say there are three categories that they fall into the most typical the usual. Everything else is an exception. Is that there are friendly relations between the mother city and the upper IKEA but they are just keep in mind always. They are totally independent. An example is the Peloponnesian War. Syracuse finds itself besieged by the Athenians they send to Corinth asking the Corinthians please help us. The Corinthians are free. They will be violating no law or sacred bond. If they say Sorry we really don't feel like doing that. It would be thought they were not behaving very well. But they would have been as I say perfectly within every right you can imagine to do that. But the typical reaction would be that the Corinthians would help to the extent first of all that they could.

Speaker 3:          00:30:43       And secondly to the extent that it was consistent with their interests. Well in fact the Corinthians self sent very little said a couple of ships and a general which turned out to be tremendously important but they couldn't have known that in advance from where we said it looks like the Corinthians were making a gesture of friendship of solidarity. The kind of thing you would expect a mother city to do not to ignore its apathy care when it was in trouble. And so that's that's all that they did and that it is a fairly first of all it was normal. For the opera. Care to turn to the mother city for help. It was normal for the mother city to be inclined to help if they could do it. That's normal. I think you if you imagine out of the many many many colonies there were that would have been the usual arrangement.

Speaker 3:          00:31:39       Now there are exceptions in both directions and as it happens the cases I know best have to do with the city of Carmen's current sent out a lot of colonies. Which is why we know something about their arrangements and the ones I'm talking about all have to do with the Peloponnesian War which is one of the few reasons one of the reasons why we know a little bit about it because facilities tells us the details of it. Well we know thanks to facilities that it had become normal for. Currents to send out to its colony part of DIA located on the Charles Citic Peninsula you know those three fingers sticking down into the Aegean Sea from the mainland of Greece. One of this is a town on one of those fingers. The part of the eye every year received magistrates who govern their city from currents.

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       And this was not imposed. This was not by force. This was by mutual agreement. So currents really had a very great deal to say about what was going on and part of the US so when part of the deal got into trouble with Athens and found itself besieged currents sent a real army to go in there and fight. And I think that's because of this very special relationship that they had at the other end of the spectrum. It's again currents. It has a colony up in the Northwest called Coursera. It is the modern island of Corfu and this colony was clearly established earlier than 664 because that's the first time we hear of it's taking any action it's been around for a while. Very early colony and from the earliest times Coursera does not get along with the mother city of Khan. The first relationship between them is a naval battle and thereafter we hear of them quarrelling and fighting with each other just about at least once a century right on down till we get to the Peloponnesian War.

Speaker 4:          00:33:56       When a quarrel over who's who's won out in that area between coronation and Coursera is the I would say well it's the first instigating element and bringing on the Peloponnesian War.

Speaker 3:          00:34:11       OK so this gives you some idea of the range of possible relationships between colony and Mother City. Just I want to emphasize one more time that the overwhelming normal situation is the first one I describe. Friendly. Why not. These guys that have gone out let us say to Syracuse they are your people. They have relatives back home. They have friends back home. It is natural. Oh by the way they're accustomed to worship the gods in the same way that the Corinthians do. We do know again two cities is our source that it was customary for colonies to send representatives back to the mother city for the religious observations that were common to them all. So that doesn't create good feelings. They feel like they're relatives and what could be more natural you're out there in Sicily and you discover of course that you don't have all of the the things that you used to have available to you but used to be made.

Speaker 3:          00:35:21       Let us say in Corinth as a matter of fact in the early days Corinth was a great center of painted pottery and was the leading producer and exporter of that. So maybe you wanted a really fine part of the kind of used to be able to walk to the corner and pick up at a pottery. But you can't get now so you would want to buy what the currency and sell. Guess what. You've got great greenfields out there in Syracuse. Hard to believe today but Sicily was one of the major granaries of the Mediterranean world at that time. Tremendously fruitful able to grow the best possible crops very good wheat and so on. Khan's always needs that kind of stuff. So we sell you are wheat you sell us your pottery you sell us good wine that we can't grow yet and maybe never we'll be able to grow in our neighborhood. So on and so forth. So you can see why it would be very natural for all sorts of ties to unite these colony and Mother City. Maybe I would just give you a chance.

Speaker 8:          00:36:28       Before I turn the next question to ask any questions that still are not clear for you about this phenomenon of colonization. Everybody OK. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:36:47       Question is who used it. Who gave permission for a colony to go in the Mother City. The best guess and that's the only thing I think we have would be. These would have been aristocratic republics. At this stage of the game and so there would have been a Council of Nobles that would typically have done it. As you move later in their history you find you can guess that there would be councils that were not purely of nobles but might be of wealthy people but they would always be a minority and come from the upper class.

Speaker 8:          00:37:20       I think that would be where they would get their legitimacy in the back. Yeah. A primitive form of what.

Speaker 3:          00:37:32       I did. I'm not sure that that concept makes it. No the answer is no because nobody was compelled to do anything. You know the British practicing mercantilism were passed navigation acts saying what ships could carry water and so on. Nothing like that in the Greek world. Everybody. All of this is voluntary on both sides of every agreed. OK now where are these colonies. Let me give you a little rundown before we get to that. I should say that the Greeks have already before this period of the polis and the period of colonization which is connected with the rise of the poles centuries before that the Greeks had already spread out from their original settlements. Right after the collapse of the masonry and world there was a period of tremendous confusion and panic and fear and so on so that we know that people fleeing from whoever destroyed the masonry and world.

Speaker 3:          00:38:41       Fled typically eastward into the island among the islands of the Aegean Sea and continuing on to the coast of Asia Minor beyond them and so that by the 10th century B.C. We see Greek cities lining the coast of Asia Minor on the West and even around on the bottom. And to some degree on the north and on the islands in the Aegean. So there has been a Greek what's the word I want an expansion of the Greek world already. By the 10th century. And these folks are now settled down so that some of these cities are in fact among the most important cities sending out colonies of their own. Of these the most famous perhaps most important was my leaders and Ionian city located on the west coast of Asia Minor which sent many a colony into different parts of the world particularly up towards the Straits and the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara.

Speaker 3:          00:39:51       I might point out that the way the Greeks did their emigration into Asia Minor. They actually had a pattern so that you can go from north to south and you will find some consistency. Here's what I mean. The the northern most settlements on that coast spoke Greek within Aeolian dialect. The I only I wrote the Ionian dialect is the one that you see on the mainland in places like Bosnia for instance Thebes and so on. South of the Ionian or Aeolian section of that was the region of Asia Minor inhabited chiefly by Iona ends. The people on the mainland who are the main Ionian obvious meanings. And finally if you go to the most southern part of the west coast of Asia Minor you come to the Dorian speaking Greeks and the whole pull up any source as you know was fundamentally a Dorian speaking place.

Speaker 3:          00:40:57       So that's the way the world looks when the policies invented and when colonization begins to become a big thing. Now let's take a look at the world of the Mediterranean and see how the Greek expansion worked. Let's start with the Aegean Sea. Just almost all the islands in that sea are inhabited by Greeks mostly by the Greeks that came in that first wave of emigrants earlier on not colonized during the 8th century and afterwards but if you go to the north shore of the Aegean Sea into the region that the Greeks called thrice. Sorry. Before I even get to race maybe even a little bit of Cecilie which is off mostly to the west of the Aegean Sea. A little bit but not thrice chiefly which is the the northern shore of the Aegean Sea. Lots of Greek colonies there. It's fundamentally part of Greece.

Speaker 3:          00:42:02       Yeah. This is not a bad time for me to remind you that in one of Plato's dialogues dialogues Socrates says the Greeks sit like. Frogs around a pond. And that pond is the Aegean Sea. It's a helpful little story to remember because we tend to think of Greece because of its modern geography. As that peninsula of which there is a sub Peninsula at the bottom is the Peloponnesian. That was not the Greece of antiquity. If you had to pick a central focus of where the Greeks were it would be in the Aegean Sea. So that's useful to remember. Then as you move east along that coast you go. You come to the Gallipoli Peninsula all of which is now Turkey and for the rest of what I'm going to be saying for a while. It'll be Turkey as well but through the straits the Dardanelles the sea of Marmara.

Speaker 3:          00:42:58       Bosphorus Greek cities all over on both sides. If you keep going east you hit the Black Sea. If you move northwards along the Black Sea and southwards as well. Greek cities not in the same number they are fewer than they are in the places I've mentioned so far but important ones. For instance when you get up to Crimea the chief city we call is such as Sebastopol. That comes from Greek words means separate us Polis the sacred city so named after Augustus by Greeks who lived there after the Emperor Augustus had achieved power. But it was always inhabited by Greeks. Similarly Odessa the chief city of Ukraine. Apart from Kiev was a Greek city and likewise on the northern shore of Turkey there are Greek cities to be found one that leaps to mind is I.

Speaker 8:          00:44:04       How do they pronounce it in Turkish. Trabzon. But it was a trap as this was a trap. No. What was it called in Greek trip to the peasants wasn't it.

Speaker 3:          00:44:17       Yeah. Anyway. So. It's not the Black Sea is not a Greek lake but there are Greek cities that are spotted along the coast now not on the East Coast. When you get to the Caucasus you are in Barbarian territory. So when the when the mythical mission of Jason and the his his Argonauts goes sailing out to that territory he is out there and you know what was it the Tarzan country or as far as the Greeks were concerned. It's just the wilds of out in that territory. Remember he marries and brings home a wife Madea and she of course is like no Greek woman who ever lived. She is a witch. She can perform magic and she can do monstrous things that you can't imagine a Greek woman doing. At least the Greeks can't imagine so that's not Greek territory out there. Well let's let's get back out into the agency and we just cross to Asia Minor. Now if you turn the bend at the southern end of Asia Minor and begin moving east there are some Greek cities along in there. But when you get to what is now.

Speaker 8:          00:45:34       Lebanon Syria the coastal places there.

Speaker 3:          00:45:39       Palestine those there are no Greek cities there. And that is because during the period we're talking about those regions were occupied by civilized powerful people who simply would not be pushed aside and nobody would even dream of trying to take them on and building cities that would challenge their control of that area. So there are no Greek cities as you keep coming down and pass Palestine you reach Egypt and of course Egypt is one of the great empires of antiquity going back into the perhaps well certainly into the fourth millennium prob possibly to the fifth by no means as powerful as it used to be. Far from it it has been conquered. By now by other peoples. If you're talking about the year 750 or something like that it's I think it's in the hands. I think it's in the. Well it is in the hands of the Assyrians and it will ultimately fall into the hands of the Persians.

Speaker 3:          00:46:47       So. That is not territory that you can build colonies in. You've got powerful empires to deal with. There is one exception in the sixth century I think it's around margin around 550 or something like that the Greeks settle a single colony in the delta of the Nile of Egypt at a place called Knock crap artists and the root of that word is ship. It is a completely different thing from the Apple key I've been talking about. It is a trading post and it's there by permission of and under the protection of the king of Egypt. And that's because he wants it's handy for him to have a merchant settlement of Greeks for him to do business with. So that's a great exception to everything I've been saying going west would you believe when you get into what is now Libya. There was a Greek a very important Greek colony of Sai Rini and that whole region was called Cyrenaica and it was a Greek and you can do that.

Speaker 3:          00:47:54       You can now you can actually go. Now that I realize it Libya is now open it's no longer a closed territory. You'll see Greek and Roman temperance there to prove it. And when you go west however. It stops in the coast of North Africa. The reason being the rest of North Africa is dominated by Carthage. Carthage is a colony of Phoenician cities Venetia was located where Lebanon is now. It goes back to the maybe the 10th century maybe the 9th and it was powerful and it tried to control not only North Africa but the waters of the Mediterranean in the West entirely. The the castle Jennings in fact have a powerful picked out terror. In the western part of Sicily and the Greeks will have to fight the Carthaginian over the years for control of the island of Sicily. So that's how far east they get and in time the Met the cousin genius is also cross over into Spain and they control some portion of the Spanish coast closest to Africa.

Speaker 3:          00:49:14       So there are no Greeks there. They're shut out for the same reasons. However once you get beyond the cost of genuine advance into Spain there are now Greek cities on the coast of Spain and there continue to be Greek said he's not everywhere but in a spotty way into France of which the most important and famous is the one that the Romans called mass cilia Marseilles. Aye aye aye Greektown. So is niece a Greek town. This was a victory town and there are several others. So the river you they know where to go. You know the Riviera. Places like that. Now what about the Italian Riviera. That's pretty nifty but a Greek colony is near Portofino where you could put in one. No. And the reason was in the northern part of Italy. There were Etruscans another powerful ancient people who control their own area and we're not about to have anybody colonizing their territory.

Speaker 3:          00:50:19       However when you keep going south in Italy past Rome the Romans were not Roman tradition says the city was found in 754 three three four five 753. So. Everybody agrees that certainly not before that. So in the period we're talking about there are no Romans that you have to worry about but south of Rome there is a tremendous colonizing of southern Italy. Greek cities all over the place. So Greek was that area that when the Romans do come to dominate most of Italy and become sort of move up against the southern region they refer to the whole southern portion of that peninsula as Magna. Great idea great Greece because they're all Greeks down there. And then finally down we go to Sicily and there you have. The East Coast. I would say two thirds of the coast of the island of Sicily is filled with Greek towns.

Speaker 3:          00:51:34       The third to the West is on the Carthaginian control. The inland. The Greeks don't move in there. The native Sicilians inhabit that territory and the Greeks are not interested you will find very rare very rare of a case of a Greek city which is found away from the sea. They always wanted to be close to the sea for varieties of region. So now I hope you have in your mind a picture of the way the Greek world had expanded by the time this wave of colonisation was complete. Pretty complete sometime in the 7th century B.C. and just a word about the leading colonizers because I think there's something to be learned from that. One of the things you kind of speculate about and wonder about why did some cities send out lots of colonies. Some cities send out only a few and others none at all for quite a while.

Speaker 3:          00:52:32       Well if you see who does then you may have a clue. Well here is a list of the early extensive colonisers. My lead I mentioned to you from Asia Minor currents on the isthmus Majora right next door to cars. Also more or less on the isthmus then we turned to the island of Nubia that long island that's right next to the east coast of Attica. You'll be up there there were two important cities in the northern part of that island. One was Karl keys and the other one was a red area. And we hear about them relatively early in the eighth century already being very important very strong and fighting each other in a famous war that they fought. But these cities were very active in colonizing in a variety of directions. Lots of these towns sent colonists up north into the Aegean into the Dardanelles and so on and beyond.

Speaker 3:          00:53:36       And some of the same cities send out colonies to Sicily so that the real colonizing states. There was no limit to where they would send people who wanted to go in those areas. It is also interesting to notice who does not colonize at this early period. And the answer is place all the most famous cities of Greece in the classical period. Athens doesn't send out a colony until sometime in the 6th century Sparta starts at an early point. Sends out a colony to southern Italy at some time probably early. They sent out a colony to an island in the Aegean Sea Milos. And then they stopped. And never sent out another colony. And finally Thebes the great the greatest city in Beersheba also does not colonize. So what can we speculate is the meaning of that. What we find is that the states who are doing most of the colonizing are located where most of the trade was going on at this point in history and also most of the manufacturing.

Speaker 3:          00:54:51       When I say manufacturing you understand everything is done by hand. But you see things like shops that contain a number of slaves working for a master. Some in some cases especially the later on you go some shops that have quite a few slaves that work to produce these things. It's the handicraft industry but it's an industry nonetheless. Well these places are. The ones that have the trade the industry and also engage in in colonization. Moreover as we will see there will be internal trouble in the form of political quarrelling economic conflict and finally warfare. Civil wars occur in some of these cities leading to the emergence and in the next the next topic I'll turn to the establishment of tyrannies as the way of resolving for a time. These terribly tumultuous conditions in those cities all of these things are true of places like Corinth and Mega and possibly Karl Case and rhetoric.

Speaker 3:          00:56:04       So. It is easy to see that where there is that kind of conflict and trouble. There would be people who would want to flee that and to go elsewhere. And it might well be that the the people who won those wars internal wars would have been glad to send them away rather than to have these discontented people in these folks who were their enemies hanging around town and making trouble. It's only speculation but it's seems to make sense. And we know we don't hear of such troubles within Athens and thieves and Sparta and it also is possible. Again it's just speculation that. Population pressure might well be greater in cities that did the colonizing they tended in general not to have as much farmland as the places that I have described as not being colonizers who may not have felt the pressures of land hunger which was so important in motivating colonisation. So though that may explain why some of the states did and others did not.

Speaker 3:          00:57:27       Finally what are the consequences to the Greek experience of this phenomenon of this outburst of colonisation. Several things come to mind. First of all the Greeks now live in places where they never lived before and their presence has a real impact in a different degree in every place. I would say that typically their impact was greater in the West. And the North than it was in the east and the South. The reason for that was that in the east and in South the Greeks lived among people who were more civilised than they who were more advanced. They had very little to teach or to impose upon those people rather than vice versa. I think I would imagine the Greeks sopping up all sorts of useful and interesting information from their neighbors in the east and the south. And there's no question about it. If you look at Greece in this period I don't know if I've used this term before but some some scholars refer to this general period talking about as the Greek Renaissance by analogy to the Renaissance in Italy.

Speaker 3:          00:58:45       And there's something to it because things happen in this period that are revolutionary in the arts. In the thinking of people philosophy is going to be invented in my leaders probably in the 6th century B.C. when my leaders was on the main routes to all of the places where advance knowledge could be found Mesopotamia Egypt anybody who looks at Greek mythology and Greek poetry and Greek stories sees there is a powerful influence coming into Greek thought. From mainly the Mesopotamian direction. Anybody who looks at the earliest Greek art for quite some time. I'm talking about sculpture and temple building will see the influence of Egypt enormously powerfully. So the Greeks are sopping up tremendous useful information and talent and skills and all sorts of things that help explain what's going to become. It is inconceivable the Greeks could have developed a civilisation that they did without contact with these Eastern civilizations and learned a great deal from them.

Speaker 3:          01:00:11       Now people some people make an enormous jump from that. And wrongly suggests that what the Greeks basically did was well if you want to take the most extreme statement of it stole and set their civilization from the other folks. Well if you take a look at Greek civilization let us say in the classical period those other cultures wouldn't have had a clue what the Greeks were doing. So different was the Greek experience from theirs. But what is undeniably true is that the Greeks learned very important and valuable things and adapted what they learned to their own way of life and produce something really quite new and in many fundamental ways not only new but the opposite of the places from which these things had come. There was also. Of course some influence of the Greeks on the people. They went to an obviously I would start out by saying this would probably have been felt most strongly in the West and in the north where the peoples who lived there before the Greeks came were not civilized or not highly civilized they did not have great urban cultures and civilizations long traditions of learning and so on.

Speaker 3:          01:01:27       No they weren't like that. The Greeks were ahead of them. And it's evident that the Greeks they borrowed stuff from the Greeks that in every element of life although it didn't shape their lives in any potent fundamental way. But that's the way influence ran in that part of the world of course. Another tremendously important consequence of colonisation was the growth of Commerce of trade for the reasons I've already given you. But beyond that the Greeks of course now had access to foodstuffs and other things out and where they settled which gave them a basis for trading with a mother city which meant there were markets for them out of the city which they hadn't existed before but also the Greeks were in touch with people beyond where they settled so they could obtain raw materials that were not available before and also manufactured things that they might not have had and access access to before.

Speaker 3:          01:02:28       All of which they would have used some for themselves and then engaged in trade with the old Greek cities. And you can see in other words you don't need a very great imagination to see how this would be a terrific boon to commerce which means think about it for a second but what will the business this be. How will this affect what's happening in the cities the Poles more and more people. And again I want to remind you never anything approaching a majority but more and more people would be making their living in a way that was not agricultural. They would be in commerce and they would be an industry in this small sense and doing all the various things that are not farming. And so you now have classes of groups of people who have interests rather different from those of the most primitive poles you could imagine and I would suggest some scholars early on the century moved by Marx's theories suggested that you had a capitalist class.

Speaker 3:          01:03:29       Growing up. And that's there's just no evidence of that. It's just wrong. My guess is that the earliest traders of any scope. Were probably noblemen who also had landed estates back home but who had the opportunity to know how the connections to make it possible to make a lot of living and trade. Even so while you don't have a class of separate people who are just in the business of making things and making money you do have people who are engaged in those activities and who have some interests that are different from those the rest of their people who are only hotlines. It is I think part of the conglomerate of activities you want to keep in your mind what's going on here is what I'm really trying to get at socially and economically and politically you have to imagine on the one hand the hop light revolution I do not shrink from saying that but it's a very debatable term.

Speaker 3:          01:04:27       What. Is going on. That is more and more farmers are becoming independent self-sustaining hop like farmers of the kind I've described and they you can't expect them to continue to live in the same way as they did before deferential to their betters that is to say tugging therefore locks before they aristocrats and just leaving all decisions to the aristocratic cow they're not going to feel the same way about it. There's going to be pressure from them for a better participation in the decisions that are made in the state. And also there will be some rich people very rich people rich in a different way from the way people used to be rich rich meant the best land. Now there will be people who will have wealth. In the form. Of precious things. And I would have I would use the word money. I'm not going to use the word coinage because that's very debated and anyway.

Speaker 3:          01:05:31       There certainly weren't any coins in Greece as early as say 750. But that doesn't mean there was no money. You could have weighed out precious metal which would be money shekels as in the Bible originally not coins. They are quantities weights of something and come to mean weights of silver or gold. So now you have a change in fundamental economic things is going on. Well all of this is tied up with this colonial story I've been telling you. And finally I think it works in both directions at the same time in terms of the impact all of these changes have on the political situation on the one hand the changes that is a the rise of the Hop like class B the development of lots of commerce and industry and wealth and a new kind. And people who don't fit into the old traditional society but have a new way has to be found to fit them in because as I say they don't fit.

Speaker 3:          01:06:48       That creates trouble. And as we shall see very shortly that trouble often takes the form of first of factional struggles within the aristocracy which then after a while come to involve people outside the aristocracy which ultimately come to civil war in which certainly the people who have become the most important fighting men the hotlines become engaged on one side or the other or perhaps sometimes on both. So that's the what you might say is the negative side of the story. But. Colonization especially some scholars have pointed out I think persuasively also for some considerable time provided an answer to that problem in the form of an escape valve where you had these people who were losers and angry and troubled or people who had in any case were not happy with the way things were going in their mother city well they didn't have to stay and fight it out.

Speaker 3:          01:07:52       They could go away and they did in very considerable numbers. And so one is easily reminded of the American experience as it has often been interpreted in which the frontier is seen to be a tremendously valuable safety valve to the Americans first as colonists and then as independent people where they didn't have the kinds of terrible class warfare and the terrible warfare within cities that the Europeans had experienced throughout most of their history because really unhappy and angry people could always go west to get new places. I mean fundamentally Kansas is a colony. In a certain Greek sense. All of these places are. So that was that's part of the story of why America had a very lucky early history that it had. And so I think we have to understand that colonization provided something analogous to that for the. For the Greek people. So. Now here we are. Somewhere in the seventh century. Most of these places I've been talking about have been several. The currents that I have been describing are flowing and the kinds of problems they give rise to will be felt in most of the towns and that is the proper introduction to the next topic which I'll discuss next year and next. It seems like a year but it's next Tuesday actually.
