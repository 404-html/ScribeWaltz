Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Let me remind you that the, uh, the Spartans ever since their victory and the Peloponnesian war had been, uh, attempting to extend their head Gemini at first all the way over into Asia. And then when that was sorted, they tried to do so on the mainland of Greece. And, uh, one consequence of their effort and the failure to achieve in an easy way was the restoration of Athens to a primary position in the Greek world. Again, not as powerful as Sparta, but once again an independent state that was a capable of being a serious opponent of the Spartans. And today I wanna talk about the emergence of a third great power in this period, which had never had a position, I think of, um, something resembling equality with the leading powers in the Greek world. Although it had had periods when it was very strong.

Speaker 1:          00:01:13       Anyway, teams is what I'm talking about now. You start, if you look at the situation in three 79 when the Spartans were in control of thieves as a consequence of the actions of a fever gas, there was a spot in garrison there in the city on its Acropolis. There were spartan garrisons in other towns in be Osha. And that was probably as low a point for the feed bins as they had experienced since the four fifties when the Athenians gained control of the Osha. But starting with the successful Sieben rebellion, which overthrew the spartan command of the city, the Thebesians launched a period of growth in power influence a wealth and even to some degree extent, which justifies a modern historians. And speaking about a period, perhaps beginning in three 71 and running at least a decade to which they give the name, the Sieben hegemony. And today I want to talk about how that happened and how it sort of developed and ended.

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       Well, not, not ended, not today. Yeah. I guess I will be talking about how in a day, right? Um, the Spartans invaded after the Athenian overthrow of spartan rule. And in the first year, the lead in that invasion was given to, uh, uh, I, the young king Cleon Burtis not to adjust the layers and his failure to undertake that command a exercise the minds of ancient writers as well as modern ones. One answer whenever adjusts the latest doesn't take command of an army, which is following a policy that he likes. People suggest that he might've been physically incapable of doing it. He was an old man and he was, he had been injured. And so there's a, that's a plausible reason that any time, and yet the ancient writers were persuaded that there were times when he was simply playing politics in some complicated way and choosing not to take the command.

Speaker 1:          00:03:39       And this is one of those occasions when they speculate that he was trying to get clean on bridges, engaged in this anti and policy, which would provide for greater support for that general [inaudible] in policy. And that that's why he had worked it so that [inaudible] has got to command. We simply can't be sure about what the truth of that is. Clay Ombre does, however, it did not a wage, a very aggressive campaign and that a first invasion of three 78 produced very, very little. However, subsequent Spartan Invasions. Also, even those led by just laze, we're not successful. The [inaudible] were able to gradually to gather their strength to, uh, recover parts of, be Osha and bring them under their power and to drive the Spartans away without yielding anything of importance. One of the consequences, I'm talking really about the years, three 88, three three 73 77, three 76 and into three 75.

Speaker 1:          00:04:57       One of the things that the, uh, Steven's engaged in in this period, and it's extremely important because it provides the basis for the power that they will develop was a reconstruction of the B Ocean League. The Thebans had commanded or led or dominated the be ocean league before they changed its constitution. However, in these years, in a way that was a rather important, it w what the in word it to simplify the matter, the entire operation of the Lee became more democratic. They used to have the decisive bodies that determine Sieben policy in the form of four separate, um, councils, which were sort of in direct regimes that really made the policy, the new constitution made the decisive place really an assembly in which all the representatives of the urban cities came and, uh, made policy in an assembly, not in separate councils, all of which could be more readily controlled by oligarchic figures.

Speaker 1:          00:06:13       And, uh, the only thing is that the meetings of the B Ocean League took place in thieves. Now, not only did Thebes have a majority of representatives in that league by, or at least the largest number by virtue of its size and its leading role, but the fact that it all took place in Thebes meant that there would be more thebesians there. And I'm Moore Stephens playing an influential role in what was going on. Nonetheless, we shouldn't discount the truly democratic nature of this regime. It's a new thing. Be Osha and Thebes used to be a bulwark of our, of a oligarchy and it became a remarkably democratic city. And, uh, I think there's reason to take note of the fact that this seemed to have had an impact on thieves and be Osha much like the one that Heraclitus praises so highly, uh, back when Athens became democratic, when they threw out the tyrants and established the Cli Senek regime, Heraclitus says they became better warriors, they produced a better army.

Speaker 1:          00:07:29       They'd began to feeding their enemies as they had not done before. I think that is very clearly also what happens in themes that we can't get away from the fact that seems became a more formidable military power thereafter. Whether or not it's linked to democracy is open to argument, but I think there is a real argument that would say it worked that way. At least we don't know the details of this very well, but a very unusual thing seems to have happened. The Thebus ultimately were able to increase the size of their army by using farmers who would not ordinarily have been able to afford hoplite equipment. But somehow the state managed to equip poorer farmers and to, uh, turn them into hoplites so that ultimately the army that Thebes commanded when you get down to the, a years after the battle of Luke Tra in which the Thebans and their friends defeated the Spartans, you will see that, uh, really a huge army by Greek standards goes marching into the Peloponnesus of which a large proportion was this Steven hoplite group that was a much more potent because of its size.

Speaker 1:          00:08:49       And it could be argued because of the spirit of these new newly hoplite in the Democrats, you might say, well, as the Thebans were developing this league, they were also fighting the Spartans and gradually driving the Spartans back. For instance, the, uh, uh, they destroyed the city of Plataea, which was always on the side of the enemies of thieves. In this case, they were on the side of the Spartans and, uh, uh, it would take a while before that was undone. They also placed a number of cities under thieving command. They didn't need to do that for most of the cities in be Osha because mostly they were, they seem to be satisfied and pleased to cooperate with the thing. I why not? I mean, I should make the point clear as to why they would be happy to do that. When the Spartans invaded be Osha.

Speaker 1:          00:09:45       They didn't only beat up Thebes. In fact, Thebes was less hurt than were the other towns because seeds was further away and better equipped to defend itself. Every time the Spartans came in, they ravage to be ocean countryside and did harm to these be ocean town. So it was thieves that was the defender, the protector of the bee oceans against the Spartans in this certainly gave them popularity. It helps explain why this new B ocean confederation was so effective and so loyal. The Thebans, we're doing a key job for be Osha and to be oceans and this, uh, meanwhile this new army that was being put together, I wasn't of course entirely new. It's heart would have been the old B ocean hoplite farmer, uh, group. But it was added to and it was given this new twist, I think really a combination twist of two kinds of, uh, elements that explain a kind of enthusiasm, a kind of morale boost that they had.

Speaker 1:          00:10:51       One was, uh, a greater sense of what we would call nationalism. It's obviously an acronystic for the city states, but we don't have a better word for it. That is to say this constant warfare, these constant attacks by the Spartans culminating in this seizure of their city against all, uh, custom against all law and very unpleasant way and the support of these oligarchs as against the common people in the ordinary folks. So that when the, this new regime led, I should point out by these two extraordinary military leaders Palapa das and anonymous. When these fellows also were responsible for the liberation of feeds, especially Palapa Daz and when they were leading the fight for the defense of Biasha, all of that meant that there was a growing feeling of we are be oceans, we are together and the enemy is the Spartans and we need to fight them, uh, to with that.

Speaker 1:          00:11:53       If you throw in the feeling that, um, democracy appears to have in its first burst, especially I should point out that, uh, the Athenian extraordinary success on land occurs right after the democratic revolution of Kleist and knees. I don't say they become bad thereafter, but they're never again quite as extraordinary as a land force as they are then. And analogy that's often drawn is with the armies of the French Revolution in the 18th century, which really were fantastically successful right after the revolution began. And they began enrolling in deed conscripting great numbers of people who would never have been in the army before, uh, on, in the name of the nation, in the name of freedom, in the name of all kinds of lovely things. Again, that's often neglected that the French already had a terrific army before that happened and they had wonderful officers and generals and was skilled in the art of war.

Speaker 1:          00:13:00       So it was a kind of a best of all worlds where they had a solid base for military superiority to which was added this great group. There's great business of numbers and the zeal that went with it, something like that I believe is going on here in the three seventies to help explain what's happening to the, what becomes is enormously powerful and successful theme and army. Um, the fighting goes on the feed bins, you remembered joined with the Athenians against the Spartans back at the time of the foundation of the Second Athenian confederacy and three 77 and they do work together for a time, but it doesn't take very long for there to grow up differences between the Athenians and the be oceans. They are, if you look back at the whole history more frequently enemies than they are friends. They are longstanding differences, suspicions, attitudes that are not entirely friendly and so on.

Speaker 1:          00:14:12       And as Stephen Power grows and as the threat from Sparta diminishes, the Athenians become less enthusiastic about their alliance with thieves because the Thebans are now emerging as a contender for the leading position for [inaudible] position in Greece. So we will see the Athenians and the FIBA gradually moving apart. In the decade of the three seventies, there was in three 75 a proposal for peace to be established in the warring Greek world. It was apparently there's some difference of opinion among our sources. But one thing that seems clear, the King of Persia was in favor of it. The ancient writers explain his reason for doing that, for being interested in having that happen. Uh, because he had other wars to fight as so often was the case. There was a rebellion in Egypt, which was always a serious menace. So he wanted peace so that he could hire Greek mercenaries to fight in his army.

Speaker 1:          00:15:25       Perhaps that wasn't the only reason that the great king had. Um, he must have been worried at the growth of Athenian power and influence at sea, which was continuing throughout this period. The second Athenian Confederacy. Never had the power and the extent that the great empire had had in the fifth century, but it, it was scary from the standpoint of the great king and so he might very well have wanted to restore peace to Greece as a way of stopping excuses for further expansion on the part of the Athenians. On the other hand, the Athenians were not unhappy to make peace as an opportunity to consolidate the gains that they had had and because that would put a stop to what I think was beginning to worry them. The expansion of Thebes and mind you, they're still worried. Number one about Sparta in three 75 Spartans haven't been defeated by anybody.

Speaker 1:          00:16:24       That's still the most serious power and there's still the power that stands for Persian, a power in the Greek world, but things have become more complicated as thieves as emerged on the scene. Well, the ancient right, a diet doors especially speaks of an event. Well, let me describe the event. He says that when it was time to sign this common piece, maybe I just want to say a word about that too. The Greek words for common piece, our coin ne a rain a, it is a term that comes up again and again in the fourth century in attempting to bring a peace agreements among the Greek states. It's, it's a new thing. As you know, piece in the past usually took the form of the swearing of odes to accept a peace treaty on very specific terms between competence in that war. The coin, a Renae concept has a more modern ring to it and it's, it's, uh, seems to have the idea that there should be a common peace among all the Greeks and that the signatories should be responsible for upholding that common piece.

Speaker 1:          00:17:44       Um, it's a very interesting idea and it sparked enormous interest in scholars, I think, especially after the first world war when all of the helpful talk about the League of Nations and [inaudible] picture of perpetual peace and all of that stuff was flying around in certain circles. So people hope to see in the coin a rainy, this might have been a, uh, a preliminary sign of that same kind of idea, but it didn't work any better in the ancient world than it has worked in the, uh, in the modern world. To get back to the first suggestion in three 75 about having such a thing, these states were agreed to do it. And then in the trouble came when thieves insisted that just as the Spartans could sign on behalf of all of their allies for the Peloponnesian League, the Thebans wanted the right to sign for all of their B ocean allies on behalf of the ocean leak.

Speaker 1:          00:18:54       It would have been the de facto recognition of the ocean league with thieves as its leader. Uh, this is really what happens if you put your minds back to four 45 in the 30 years piece that concluded what we call the first Peloponnesian war. When the A, a spartan is allow the Athenians to sign and speak for all the members of its league. They were giving de facto recognition and regarding the Greeks, the Athenians as their equals. This was something that the Spartans, no doubt a lid chiefly in this view, by adjust the latest, they were not going to let the feed bins do it. In fact, we are told in a very bold action adjusts to lay is struck the feed bins from the lists. The list of those who had taken her word would take part in the piece because they insisted on this cloth.

Speaker 1:          00:19:51       Now there's a problem about this. The same story almost identically is told in three 71 when we come to the attempt at another coin, a rainy, uh, to, to bring peace to the general Greek world. The whole story is told in this pretty much the same way and the upshot of the one in three 71 will be the great battle of loop truck. This has led some scholars to say diet doors. Who is the source of these tales simply has screwed up. It's got it wrong. This is what they call a doublet. Somehow he projected backwards. An event that really happened in [inaudible] 71 and has it happened twice? I'm very, very suspicious about modern historians who were prepared to rip up pieces of ancient historians because we know better and it just doesn't make any sense as the argument. The truth is, I can see no reason why they shouldn't have twice.

Speaker 1:          00:20:49       Certainly adjust. Uh, what's his name, uh, at Pamet on this would have insisted on that. Certainly the Spartans would have objected to it. Uh, the actions that go with it strike me as being perfectly okay in three 75 and win four years later. A similar circumstance emerges. Why shouldn't the same thing happened again, I haven't really looked into this, but I can imagine if you look through the whole Cold War history, uh, I'm sure you'll find many things that are happening over and over again and exactly the same way because the circumstances haven't changed. So with my characteristic Gullibility, I believe in the story as it is told in three 75, well fighting resumed since the piece really didn't hold and the, uh, the Thebans continue and the be oceans in general continue to successfully fight off the Spartans. I should have mentioned in the course of this fighting.

Speaker 1:          00:21:46       Soon after the uh, treaty, there's an amazing occasion which has Harbinger's for the future. A Spartan army is marching in one direction. A theme and army is marching in another direction. The Spartans out number. The theme runs very greatly. In fact, the Thevenin whole Sieben force is simply the 300 men who had been formed pretty recently into a special elite fighting corps called the sacred band. They're special quality was that in addition to being excellent warriors and a trained specially for their job, they were a homosexual lovers who stood and fought right next to each other. This was a just carrying forward the principle that the Spartans had used in one way and another, and it turned out to be equally successful. This sacred man was a tremendous fighting force and will play a critical role in the important battle of Luke Tra. Anyway, they managed to defeat in hoplite battle a spartan forest that is greater than they are.

Speaker 1:          00:23:01       It's not a real hundred percent happy hoplite battle. The numbers. There are only 300 feed bins. Even as about a thousand a Spartans. It's the way of battle is fought, is not traditional and typical. It's a little peculiar. So you really can't regard it as the decisive time. Somebody beat a spartan hoplite Phalanx and battle that we'll have to wait till Luke trip. On the other hand, it, the evidence of the ancients is that it really impressed the Greek world in general. Even this form of a victory over a spartan hoplites was unprecedented and it really, I think a kind of shook some people in terms of their confidence at the Spartans would always win a battle like that. So the fighting goes on on all the fronts that I have mentioned to you until finally we get down to three 71 and in three 71 the same thing happens.

Speaker 1:          00:23:59       There is a pressure from the Persians for a general piece. The Athenians are not against that idea, uh, but the same tale I told you last time, there's no question that had happened that Luke Trin, nobody doubts that. And the result was a renewal of the war with the Spartans taking the lead aggressively moving into be Osha as they had done every time before. I think it's very worth mentioning that we don't have any case up to now up to three 71 in which to be oceans and their friends and allies marching to the Peloponnesus. All the attacking has been by the Spartans into the Osha, which means these wars have always been costly to be Osha, but not to Sparta. And we'll see that the, one of the things that [inaudible] does, wants to do when he can is to, um, reverse that situation. So this brings us to the battle of Luke Tra.

Speaker 1:          00:25:07       Luke Tra is a town in southwestern be Osha, the two armies march towards each other and there's a lot of maneuvering this way in that way. But finally they come on to this rather small field. If you, uh, you can go there today and look at it, it's really pretty easy to s to place the ancient story into the modern, uh, geography. Uh, each, there's a plane between two hills, went to the south and one to the north. The ocean army took up its position on the northern hill. The Spartans took up there is on the southern hill. Uh, and then, uh, finally when the day life came, they moved forward and fought each other in this field, which is sort of, it's, it's plenty big enough for any kind of hoplite battle that you want to have. But some scholars have wanted to make a, to explain the battle in terms of a limited space, but I think that really isn't an issue.

Speaker 1:          00:26:14       This is a sort of a typical spark as typical hoplite battle field. So can we Burdis marches on themes again, it's not adjust the, and I mean, this looks like the culmination of adjusts the laces. Antifreeze urban policy. He's not there again, the ancient writers and modern scholars, uh, wonder why he wasn't there. I'm prepared to take the simple minded view. If he wasn't there, he couldn't have been there. He must've been out of action for physical reasons because I can't imagine any good reason why he wouldn't want to be there for the payoff here. Anyway, there was something in the neighborhood of 10,000 Spartan hoplites and maybe a thousand calvary. And it's the sport that could be ocean side is less clear, maybe, maybe six, maybe 7,000 B ocean hoplites. So they are outnumbered. And I think that has a lot to do with the tactics that he and on employs in fighting this battle. It's a famous battle. It's an important battle. So I'll take a few moments to talk about the battle itself.

Speaker 1:          00:27:28       Again, this is a much debated, it's not easy to know what's going on or why it's going on, but let's start with the important point that the [inaudible] were outnumbered. So it really was up to a Pam [inaudible] to think of some way to overcome this disadvantage. Normal course of events, six or 7,000 against 10,000 in irregular hoplite battle. You can, the bookies would take the game off the board. I mean the, especially if they're Spartans and palpitations, the, uh, the bigger, the bigger battalions are going to win. So a feminine, this comes up with certainly to s nobody can deny that he came up with some kind of plan. What am I fussing about here? Some scholars have wanted to emphasize not the tactics of, of Pamela Honda's, but rather this superior fighting qualities of this new fiebing democratic national army. Well, I certainly think that made a difference.

Speaker 1:          00:28:35       I give real credit to that element and yet I can't escape thinking that there really was a very tricky, unusual strategy or tactics or operational plan used by a patent on this that, uh, accounts in a considerable part for the success of the seabirds in this battle. He lined, the normal way you line up is that the, the sort of the leading forces on each side take up the right wing of their Phalanx. That's the position of honor. And that's where you try to beat the other guy that has the consequences incidentally, of meaning that the best army doesn't fight against the best army. In each case, the best army is fighting against a weaker portion of the enemy army. That's not what Apam it on. This wanted, he put his fiebing forces with the 300 a sacred band members at the front of it. He, his, uh, his own group was at the left side of the B ocean line facing the Spartans directly.

Speaker 1:          00:29:43       Now the Spartans had to realize when they saw what was going on, oh, it, forgive me, I forgot to tell you another very important thing. Instead of the usual depth of the Phalanx, eight, 12, maybe 16, ranks, uh, Pam and don does loaded his left wing 50 men deep. And that is, it may be precedented, but if so, it's extremely rare in the past, his idea apparently. And then when he started for battle, he took his left wing and moved it over bleakly further to the left, the plan being to flank the Spartans if they could and come at them from their vulnerable side and to, uh, uh, do so in Turin, tremendous strength. I think the idea of the tremendous strength in depth was to win on that side quickly because he was weak obviously on his right. I suppose that the force immediately after the Siemens, what itself presents a problem because if the feed bins went sharply to the left on this occasion with their deep powerful Phalanx, the guys next to them probably would move with them to some degree but not with the same speed and not at the same determination because their situation, so there was the danger of there being an opening right there.

Speaker 1:          00:31:22       That would have been very scary. Apparently a Ananda monotonous told the people on the right. I would have thought everybody to the right of his outfit to proceed only very slowly. If that's the case, the Spartans then on the, the pep help Aneesh and army on their left would have had to take some time before they could encounter the B ocean army so that the first fighting would be on the left. We're at Pam on this, wanted it and his hope was, in a way, this is a variety of the marathon strategy. You remember the big thing there was the, the uh, Siemens under mill tighties hoped to win swiftly on the wings where they had greater depths. They knew they would lose in the middle. They just hope they would lose slower than they would win on the wings. I think this is a version of the same idea and so, uh, on this and his, uh, uh, block of feed bins goes to the left and I would argue in the ancient sources save is to, uh, swiftly as, as Herata to set of the Athenians that marathon draw boy on the run.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       Well, I guess that means on the truck. And so they were, they wanted to get that fight going as fast as they could and to win it as fast as they could. Well, that's the essential idea that they would win powerfully on the left and send the Spartans into route and thereby destroy their whole campaign. Now we have to account for funny things that happen apart from the Phalanx before the battle is over, both sides take their cavalry from the usual position on the wings on the flanks of the Phalanx. Meant either to protect your wings or to assault the other, the enemy on his wing and move it to the center of the battlefield where it plays a role. And so the question always is, what are they doing? What's this all about? And one here, I think one can only speculate, uh, surely it would have been a wise thing for a Pam does to move his cavalry into the center of the field in front of the center of his line, not in front of him, but in front of the guys to his right.

Speaker 1:          00:33:53       Because they too would have had an effect of slowing down any spartan attack where there was a vulnerability. So if you take it from that point of view, you could think to Spartans who definitely moved there. Cavalry out front, uh, did. So in order to combat the fiebing cavalry, that would be an explanation enough. But some scholars make an argument and, uh, there's some reason to think they might be right. That the Spartans seeing what, uh, uh, Pam anonymous was doing, knew that he was trying to flank them on the right side. And so this, they wanted to take steps to prevent being flanked on that side. And so they did something which they tried to do at the battle of [inaudible], but it didn't happen for them. They pull troops out from the center of their line, sent them around behind the Phalanx and put them out.

Speaker 1:          00:34:54       They hoped on the right wing to prevent exactly that kind of an event. But to prevent this as the feed bins from or the be oceans from charging that empty spot until it was filled, they sent their cavalry upfront to shield them, not only to shield them, but in effect to, to hide them. Certainly the cavalry's being out there would have kicked up a lot of dust and uh, they could have hoped that the demons wouldn't know what was going on. So that was the theory. What is a fact is that the oceans, ocean fact cavalry and the Spartan Cavalry clashed. And as I think, again, the bookies, if this happened, would've predicted, um, the feed bins defeated the upheld nations to Siemens had a superior calvary. Uh, it has to do, of course with the nature of their land, which is better for horses then, uh, most of Greek country.

Speaker 1:          00:35:54       And so they drove the cavalry back into the Spartan Phalanx helping to create confusion and to break ranks and all that kind of stuff. But the real payoff, the real victory in the battle was won where Pam and on this hoped it would be on his left flank on the Spartan right flank. I don't think it's an accident that the Phalanx, the Phalanx came swiftly to the place where the spartan king was located, clean Han Broadus and killed him. And if you look at Greek battles throughout all of their history, killing the general in command is a really good idea because when you do that, you usually win. If you've got numbers, uh, Curtis on that, or just got a general idea of, of how, how often that is a decisive or important element. It's very frequent, isn't it? When you kill the general, you'll win.

Speaker 1:          00:36:57       Curtis knows more about military history and the Greek world. Anybody. So I have to consultant. Um, so, uh, that thing, the case, the Spartans fought bravely and strongly around the body of their king, but that only led more than to be killed. And before very long, the Spartan Phalanx broke and ran and the thi bins to be oceans had one, a clear cut, unmistakable, blatant victory in an normal hoplite battle on a normal field. And this was the shock felt round. The Greek world that this had happened, just changed everything. There were only, here's an interesting fact that tells you something else that's important about what's going on in the Greek world. There were only perhaps 700 Sparty eights in the whole battle and of these 400 were killed. That's the think about that. I mean, that's devastating in so many ways. Um, and it had this all kinds of effects.

Speaker 1:          00:38:14       It, we shall see. It immediately shook, uh, the control of the Spartans even over the Peloponnesus. Uh, it made people think the Spartans were vulnerable and that they might've come to the end of the line. But another interesting contrary consequence was that suddenly Sparta wasn't scary, but thieves was very scary. And the Athenians who had already come to, uh, uh, be nervous about the Thebans. You notice I haven't mentioned that they were, had been the allies of feeds. They were not at the battle of blue truck. And as a matter of fact, they were clearly working with the Spartans already to check Steven power and even expansion before the battle of Luke trip. They stay where they stay neutral. They didn't show up at the battle at all, but it tells you a very important change in the scene, uh, in the, in the Greek world at this time.

Speaker 1:          00:39:18       So I think it's safe to say the battle of Luke Tra put an end to spartan supremacy. This apartment had Germany is over. And now the question that awaits increases what happens next? I think in the normal course of events, prior to the buildup of this new themes, uh, there would have been a division of power between the states. The Athenians would have used some muscle, the themes would have used some muscle. Uh, some lesser states would have emerged in the vacuum created by the, the destruction of pavement up spartan power. But that would have been that. However, given all that had happened in the Osha and the kind of leadership that existed in Thebes, um, something amazing then happen. The feed bins decided to put an end to spartan power forever and took a number of measures to bring that about. Just the defeat of Luke tre meant the disintegration of the Peloponnesian League, a number of states, obviously it took advantage of Sparta as weakness to just pull out and get out from under Spartan control.

Speaker 1:          00:40:39       And then in the year three 70, the theme wins, put together a tremendous army and, uh, ultimately marched into the Peloponnesus to do what they were going to do. One of the things that happen reflecting the collapse of the Spartan, uh, a Gemini in the Peloponnesus was that the towns in the region of Arcadia, the mountain, this region to the north of the Sparta, put themselves together in the form of the Arcadian League. And it is, I mentioned this to you earlier, I believe it is one of the first federal leagues of a kind from the one we've seen up to now. There is no hegemony will state, it is not some big state and it's friends which even the B Ocean League is still in that category. It is in fact a collection of states that are extensively equal and this is entirely voluntary. They are coming together, these Arcadian states in order to protect themselves and to pursue their interests against the many troubles they've had over the years.

Speaker 1:          00:42:06       And uh, the question always is then there's, this is a both the evidence of what I'm saying, that it was a new kind of a league and it reveals the fact that there was no state that was sufficiently superior to the others. That to make it obvious that the capital, so to speak of this new confederation would be that state. They built a brand new city. It was called, I love it. Megalopolis that means it ran from Washington to Boston. No, I'm sorry. It meant it meant, of course it means big polis, big city, big state, whatever you want. Uh, but it was the place where the a league counsel met State Center, their representatives to it. Their business was done there. And it's really quite an interesting event, especially as you look ahead in the history of Greason. And as I told you last time, that kind of thing had a remarkable influence on the thinking of the shapers of the American constitution.

Speaker 1:          00:43:14       You Athenians attitude towards this. We think about all this long rivalry between Sparta and Athens that had resulted in such terrible wars. It just goes to show you, what was it, a palmist in the 19th century British statesmen, I think he wants said Britain has no permanent friends or enemies, only permanent interests. And I think what, whether that was true or Britain or not at the time, I think, and we should always realize that that is true of the way states operate in an international system. It is not that they don't have inclinations and longstanding friendships do have some impact and longstanding enmities have a greater impact. And yet anything can happen. I mean just to get some sense of that. Uh, who would have believed that, uh, in the 1930s that Great Britain and France would join with Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union for any purpose, whatever, since they, especially the British had been interested in putting an end to that regime from the moment that it was invented and that Winston Churchill would be the greatest advocate of this alliance with styling Winston Churchill, who had been the leading figure in having an invasion of Russia in 19 2021 in order to bring down the Bolshevik regime and what Churchill, his answer, I think to the question of why you're doing this, uh, tells you a lot about this general point I'm trying to make.

Speaker 1:          00:45:04       I'm not going to get this exactly right. I don't have Churchill's gift and my memory is fading. But, uh, and he said, if, you know, why are you joining up with stolen? You know, you've been denouncing him forever. He said, he said, if the devil, no, I'm sorry. If Hitler invaded hill, at the very least, I would want to say a few kind words about the devil in the House of Commons.

Speaker 1:          00:45:32       That ought to tell you something about the permanence of these kinds of thing. Interests are what matter. And He, this Athenian interests had changed. Thebes was becoming a challenge to the Athenian growth and influence and power and they did not want the Thebans now to destroy Sparta has control of the Peloponnesus and replace it with a Thevenin control of the Peloponnesus and that accounts both full white, uh, Athens is not helping the Thebans but also in fact intriguing with states in the Peloponnesus to try to stand up to the feed bins rather than to do what, what might seem obvious.

Speaker 1:          00:46:21       Now the Thebans we're continue, I'm, I'll, I'll come back to their invasion just a moment. They were continuing to grow. They were gaining allies in, uh, central Greece forces. He totally IA at cornea low. Chris, you'll be here again, I'm going to be teaching you general truths about international relations that are, don't seem to be a part of the ordinary education. And that is power. Has a fantastically attractive quality when a state is suddenly enormously powerful. You know, I think the political scientists rules, uh, I, and I admit that what I just said has been known and said by many of them many times. But the favorite thing is if there's a great power, what happens next? What happens is all the other states get together and join up to two to control that power to which the answer is sometimes a lot of times, and that they have another term to consider the alternative, which they called Bandwagon bandwagoning and that is states are attracted by that power.

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       Want to get on the right side of that power, join up with that power. And that's what happened here, where suddenly the theme and power in that area that became seem so strong that you wanted to be on that side. I'm just in this terrible and that analogizing mood today. So please forgive me. But, but lest you think the study of ancient history is not relevant to your understanding of the world today, and I know none of you would be so foolish as to think that. Let me just point out, just look what's happening in the Middle East, and I'll say it before it's common wisdom so that you will see how smart I am, Syria, which has been nothing but trouble for our side. Uh, all this time all of a sudden seems to be behaving in a different way. And even the United States government says that the Syrian seemed not to be feeding more al Qaeda people across the border into Iraq.

Speaker 1:          00:48:30       Why is that? What have they found? Religion? Oh, I guess they had religion already, but um, um, the answer is because suddenly the American forces are kicking hell out of everybody and Iraq and suddenly there's a powerful American army sitting there, which is right next door to Iran, to Syria. It's also right next door we run. We should have interesting consequences to, um, the result is that the Syrians are suddenly talking very differently. Now that doesn't mean that there'll be a permanent change that will depend upon realities, but it's, I, you need to, you get fed so much gunk in a different direction. The most important single element in international relations, not the only one by any means, but the most important one is power and the perception of where the power is and the perception of whether that power is growing or shrinking. Nothing is as important as that.

Speaker 1:          00:49:32       Everything else contributes, but it doesn't have that central role. Well that's the situation that the feed bins have created with their victory. And so they are expanding all over the place. They are even Stevens with great land Lubbers. They are, they're even building a navy. They are moving out into the Aegean Sea. And uh, that's one of the things that has created this nervousness in Athens and explains the Athenian behavior. Now comes this great invasion in the, over the year three 73 69, the total force of hoplites in the army put together by [inaudible]. This is reported to be 40,000. Now there's just not a number like that, uh, in, in the whole fifth century basically or anytime before this. It's just an amazing army. And we are told there were some 30,000 others on the campaign who were not hoplites. Maybe many of them weren't even fighters, but a lot of them would have been cavalry, light armed infantry and so on.

Speaker 1:          00:50:48       But in any case here, a 70,000 people, meaning no good to the Spartans pouring into the Peloponnesus in that year, it is the largest military force reported in Greek history. The leading the men in charge of these two extraordinary men at feminine does and Palapa Das who repeatedly had proved themselves, by the way, it was Palapa Das who won that victory in three 75 at to Gyra. Remember that with the 300. So he has that great victory on his record and feminine does of course is the architect of the victory at Luke Tra. And uh, they just are amazing and remarkable people. If you read some of those, uh, we, we do not have a blue chalk biography of APAM anonymous, although he does give us a Palapa at us. We're happy about that. But the owl before I got through, I will try to remedy that as I tried to do in the case of THRASS of Boulez by bringing to your attention how great was the reputation of Epam.

Speaker 1:          00:51:58       Anon does in the Greek world. Maybe I should just say a word about him now. He, um, he is reputed to have been a person of great intellect. Apparently he was a philosopher and a took that seriously and was respect with regard with respect by others, uh, of that elk in that world. And uh, of course he looks, it looks very much as though he is a man of political convictions of such a kindness, almost a suggest political theory. I mean, he seems to have been committed really to the idea of democracy as a good thing in itself. On this latter point, we just don't have very much evidence. No nothing that he said. Uh, but we do have what he did, which squares perfectly with what we are talking about. It would be, I mean, it breaks my heart there. These lives that Plutarch did not right.

Speaker 1:          00:53:03       What I would give for a life of Christ, the knees by Plutarch and similarly of EPAM anonymous. Uh, and I'm amazed, I don't know who knows why blue tarp did what he did, but in any case, it would be really fascinating in his case because of the complicated nature of his mind and his life. But there he is along with Palapas leading this armed force in there. They move down into Laconia, the home territory of the Spartans. Now the Spartans are forced to huddle in their city and to try to resist anything that comes at them. They cannot go out to fight these people invading their homeland. Their fucking homeland has never been invaded in anybody's memory. This is out of the question. Nothing like this would have been possible. And here they are just hiding in their city, not even a walled city because it was part of their pride.

Speaker 1:          00:54:05       They don't need walls. They have an army. Nobody can come in there and attack their city. And there they are. And what does a Pam Anon does do? He does not go after them in that city because probably he has a one reason would have been fighting in the city. You know, urban warfare is always difficult and costly and nobody until lately is really good at it. Uh, I mean if, I don't know how much you've paid attention to what's going on in Iraq these days in the so called surge, but when you, if you, if you study it as a military problem and then you see how they dealt with that military problem, it is one of the really most brilliant things I have ever seen because it would be successful in this, in, in the war I'm talking about now, requires not only shrewd use of military forces for military purposes, but it has to be integrated with constant political negotiation and conversation with the natives, which has to be associated also with certain economic conditions being brought about.

Speaker 1:          00:55:14       So that the, uh, the people who are, uh, might be on the other side can be on your side and then you can have them work for you. Uh, and I've only touched on the beginning of all the complexity of that. So, but in any case, which until that, until until that happened, there are very few cases of really successful urban warfare without a tremendous cost. Well, of course, before they figured out what to do in Iraq, they had some tremendous costs of not figuring it out. But what I'm getting at is, yes, I'm sure that if a patent on this and wanted to, he would have, uh, been able to defeat the Spartans in their city, but he would have paid a great price. Now, there's perhaps another consideration, uh, what he, what that, let me, before I come to that, let me just tell you that what the, but apartment houses did his bypass the city ravage what the countryside, where ever he founded, doing as much harm as he possibly could.

Speaker 1:          00:56:18       And even as this was happening and was obviously reported back to the Spartans, the Spartans did not come out to fight. Now here. Here's where I think once again, Victor Hansen's, a splendid imagination, uh, comes into the picture in what I find to be a very persuasive explanation of what's going on. And he'd makes this explanation based on an analogy he draws with the army of General Sherman during the American civil war when Sherman's famous march to the sea or is march through Georgia when there is a confederate army to the north of where he goes, but he doesn't seek them out. He goes marching towards where he wants to get to, doing as much damage as he possibly can, destroying the food, the crops, animals, uh, everything he had burning down houses being as nasty and unpleasant as he can be. Uh, why is the question, will he be nasty, unpleasant fellow?

Speaker 1:          00:57:34       Not really. He, we, we do know a lot about what Sherman thought he was doing cause he wrote about it. Sherman apparently hated this southern slave. Ocracy he wasn't satisfied with defeating the south as many a northerner was and then sort of letting it be what it had been before or perhaps destroying slavery itself and leaving everything else. Pretty much as it had been. He seems to have thought this was a terrible wicked society. And if it wasn't to go back to its old bad ways, it not only had to be defeated, it had to be humiliated. Part of his, his view, part of the success of the south was in building up what he would've thought of as a myth of their aristocratic superiority, which made slave holding appropriate because the people who were superior were ruling over people who were inferior and they deserved it because they were better fighters than anybody else.

Speaker 1:          00:58:39       Everybody a thought at the beginning of the war, certainly that the south had a better military tradition and that they were better soldiers and I think they were, uh, and that they were courageous. Being a great military man means being courageous and all of that justify the system and provided the pride that made it possible to work well. Sherman wanted to show it wasn't so, and here they were burning down houses and Barns and food and the women folk having to stand there and watch it. And where was the confederate army? He didn't come down to challenge them and he felt in the process he was destroying the myth that was more potent. Well, I think he's so handsome. Certainly has that right when he talks about Sherman, and it's very attractive to think that may be Pam Anon. This was after the same thing.

Speaker 1:          00:59:34       Here were the Spartans cowering in their city. It would be said while a Pam and on this was doing as he liked with the Peloponnesus. There would never again be a time where people would accept the story that the Spartans with a great fighter is the great heroes, et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera. In any case, that's what he did. And then it wasn't. I think all of this is assisted by some of the things he did and some of the things that he actually said. He went to Macedonia. And indeed he went to the place where the Mycenaeans had withdrawn for security and in their rebellions up there, uh, and he established or reestablished a city called Mess Sini. It was powerfully fortify. There was up on a mountain. It was a place where you could really defend it. And it became the capital of Miscellanea, which would now be a Freeman seenia in which the former [inaudible], the former slaves of the spartan state, would now rule their own country as they had not done for centuries.

Speaker 1:          01:00:53       And it was a liberation and it was, that was the language that Apam Anon is used of it. It had the marvelous psychological effects that I'm speaking of. And also a very practical one here was a fortress on the flank of the Spartans, which was controlled by people who hated the Spartans bitterly. And that would guarantee that the Spartans would not likely gain control of the western Peloponnesus. Again, if you add to that, that the Arcadians had suffered plenty from the Spartans and we're unwilling to allow the Spartans to rise again, and there was megalopolis a walled powerful city that would see to it that the Spartans would never likely be able to make their way into control of central and northern Peloponnesus again. And so all of this combination of power and the strategic use of power, uh, along with this psychological warfare that was involved, brought about the, uh, permanent check on Sparta, Sparta.

Speaker 1:          01:02:02       Amazingly enough, when emerged from this still an independent city, still somehow taken seriously by others, but never again in the position of threatening the security of a other stakes. Now, some of what was happening, uh, began to create a counter force as it always does. Here was this blatantly democratic force that had been unleashed in the Peloponnesus, most of which had always been oligarchic. So in Arcadia, there began to be a revival of oligarchic activity. People who wanted to overthrow the regime that was being established and to restore oligarchic governments, which would of course naturally be friendly to Sparta. And some of these oligarchs in Arcadia began to assist the Spartans. We know the Spartans were finished, but they didn't know it. The Greeks at the time didn't know it. So that I'm, I'm just touching on the high points here. In three 62 by now, I should report that Palapa Diaz was dead.

Speaker 1:          01:03:19       He had died fighting incessantly against a, uh, uh, an autocrat there by the name of Jason from the city of Fareye. Uh, who about it, and we don't know a lot except to say you've got to be very powerful indeed, and was pretty soon challenging both thieves on the land and also challenging Athens to some degree at sea. Uh, and he, who knows how much trouble he would have made had he not died before he could do so. But apartment, sorry. Palapa does died fighting in a battle against, uh, uh, Jason, I think it was three 64. So in three 62, when the Thebans again put together a forced to invade the Peloponnesus to put down those forces that were working against his settlement, it was only EPAM. Anon does, who was in charge apparently in the battle of [inaudible]. This is the second battle of Maton Nia, the first took place in the Peloponnesian war and four 18 but this one in three 62, apparently, uh, upenn monotonous use some of the very same tactics that had been successful in the, uh, in the battle that look, Trump and the thi bins won the battle of lecture, uh, of, uh, uh, man Tinea, however, at Pamet on vis was killed in the fighting.

Speaker 1:          01:04:45       And it turned out that that was more important than anything else. W with both Palapa das and Epam, Anon does gone. Thebes never again shows that kind of special quality that brought it swiftly to power and will swiftly bring it down. Although we, as we look at the world in three 62, we should realize that Thebes remains a very formidable power. And the Greeks, again, I want to more new, don't know that seems isn't going to come back and with two new leaders or 10 new leaders or one or whatever, and become the same kind of a menace that it had been before. But looking back, we can see that that was the outcome. So, uh, this evening has won the victory, but in effect they really lost the war because that was the end of their special quality. CICERO writing about this year, centuries later called Epam Pamet on desk, the foremost man of Greece, there is an inscription or there wasn't an inscription on it, [inaudible] statue that was erected on his death at Thebes.

Speaker 1:          01:06:01       And it is as though he was speaking, it must have been taken somehow, uh, from something he said or wrote. Here's what he said by my plans was Sparta Shorn of her glory and Holy Miss Seenia had last received back her children by the weapons of Thebes was miss seenia fortified and all Greece became independent and free. Now, of course, the claim that everybody was seeking independence for the Greeks out tonal. Mia is an old stale, uh, one that never really worked. This is the first time that I am aware. No, I should, that's not true. The Spartans entered the Peloponnesian war claiming that they were fighting to free the Greeks, but of course they immediately began in slaving as many of them as they could when they won the war. But a Pam and don says, well, we did this, we accomplish this. And at the end of the day, the Greeks, the, the, uh, all of Greece was free.

Speaker 1:          01:07:14       He claimed sure it wasn't perfectly true, but there was a lot in it. And, uh, that's what he was proud of. That's what he thought he was doing. I think that's the important point about that quotation. It tells us what he would have wanted, has indeed, and has worked out that way to come down as his legacy. What did a Honda did he say he increased the power of Thebes tenfold? He made Thebes name ringing the Valhalla. He never heard of Valhalla, um, in the Valhalla of heroes throughout history. Uh, that's not what he wanted to have said. What he wanted it to have said was, I restored the Mycenaeans to their land. I restored them to safety. I gave them freedom. I left Greece free and independent Xenophon writing. After his description of the battle of Manton, it says the following, and these are the last words in his [inaudible] and his history of Greek affairs.

Speaker 1:          01:08:18       In his time since nearly all the people of Greece have come together or had come together and form themselves in opposing lines, there was no one who did not suppose that if a battle were fought, those who proved victorious would be the rulers. And those who were defeated would be their subjects while each side claimed to be victorious. Neither was found to be any better off than before the battle took place. But there was even more confusion and disorder in Greece after the battle than before. So here's a case for the, um, the unimportance of warfare. You might say for those people that want to make that case, that hair was all this fighting here are all the dead. And at the end of the day, nothing had been settled. That is often the case in war, although it might be said that something pretty serious had been settled by the campaigns that the feed bins had fought before the battle of Manson, Nia.

Speaker 1:          01:09:24       And at before the battle of math and the and that Greece will never be the same again because of the fighting that had taken place before. But as we look forward, not backwards, it's worth noticing that that the years of competition for had Gemini, which go back, you know, at least to the days after the Persian wars had left Greece weakened and divided and therefore open for exploitation and even conquest by a new threat from outside the system, which was not even dreamed of by the Greeks as a menace in three 62 at the bat and Love Man Antonia. And there's something to be learned in, in there too. I mean if you had taken a poll of the Greeks and said, where are the dangers to us now? What problems do we have? What they would have been talking about the traditional conflicts between the Greek city states. No one I think with have used the word Macedonia as part of anything that looked scary. And of course nobody would have uttered the name Phillip Because Phillip wasn't even king of Macedonia yet. And yet within a few years, Phillip would be the king of Macedonia, and within a couple of three decades, it would suddenly be a real menace from the north. That would be very threatening, and we'll take a look at that next time.
