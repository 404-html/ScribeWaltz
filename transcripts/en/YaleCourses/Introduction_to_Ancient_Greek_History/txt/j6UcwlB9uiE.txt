Speaker 1:          00:00:01       I think the last thing I mentioned to you was the attempted coup data on the part of a nobleman by the name of Kahlon who was attempting to establish a tyranny of the sort that were becoming. That was becoming common in the neighborhood and that he was the son in law of a tyrant. Next door mega it the coup failed. But the problems that we imagine produced the coup did not go away. And one sees evidence of continuing pressure for change away from the traditional aristocratic Republic which the early polls was towards something that would challenge the unquestioned traditional rule of the aristocracy in. Again these are all traditional dates and shouldn't be taken too seriously as precise but probably reflect a pretty decent chronology in a general way so that in the traditional year of six twenty one we hear that Athens received its first written law code famous as the code of Draco or in Greek it would be Dirac Kahn and the reports that we have of it indicate that one kind of law that was included in the code was concerning homicide which has a special place in the Greek thinking probably it's true of most primitive societies that homicide involves religious ideas.

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       The Greeks believed that killing of men was accepted more time was a religious pollution that had to be taken care of one way or another. Beyond that there was also the primitive thing that was not particularly religious but reflected primitive thinking of all homicides need to be avenged. And so the blood feud was clearly part of the way to deal with homicide and early Greek history. And as is true of most early societies there comes a time when that no longer will do that there is a sufficient civilization urbanization whatever it is that made the change that people feel this has got to stop. One reason it does is of course it tears a community apart. And as you are in the business of building a community which is what's happening here in the polls you can't have that going on. One reason it is the way to settle things is because there isn't any proper government.

Speaker 1:          00:02:57       There are only these noblemen. There is a council to be sure but it's all a question of going to somebody who has power and has respect and getting a judgment from them. But as time passes that's not good enough. And as the community becomes something that is more I'm more unified. There is a search for a better outcome. And that is what resulted in the code of Draco which just the fact that there is a written code so that it is now available to anybody who can read which is not to say lots of people but even so people who can read can now tell it to other people. That very fact is the sign of the decline of the power of the aristocracy because they alone used to know what the law was or a claim to know it and people would go to them and say what's the law.

Speaker 1:          00:03:52       And they could administer it as they saw fit which gave them extraordinary power not to say prestige. Now when it is possible at least in some realms of the law to know what that law is that has reduced the special place that the Aristocrats have in society stories are told about the code of Draco Like most early law codes and we can't compare the draconian code with famous or less famous ones much older that we find especially in Mesopotamia and the Ancient Near East. The most famous of these because it has been inscribed on a remarkable piece of sculpture which is now in the Louvre in Paris the Code of Hammurabi from the second millennium B.C. is really quite similar in its essence. It says if so and so does such a thing. This is what the punishment is. And from our point of view early codes like Draco are notorious for how harsh they are. The Greeks later on said that the code of Draco was written not in ink but in blood.

Speaker 1:          00:05:17       And but in fact what it does is to codify what had been the ordinary practice. Nobody was inventing laws. They were writing down what had been the customary procedures. And again a characteristic of such developments is that over time when people know how harsh these things are. And as society sort of calms down from the more wild condition that it was in an earlier time it tends to reduce the severity of the penalties and to legislate. However the legislation goes forward in a more gentle way. So that's another development which is obviously the consequence of aristocrats don't give up their power willingly out of the goodness of their hearts. This pressure out there. Scuse me for access to the legal process for the ordinary person and again I think it's easy to believe that a lot of that pressure is coming from that hop like farmer class that is becoming more important and more demanding all the time another change in the old placid life of the early Athenian Republic as we imagined it to be is the conquest by the Athenians of the island of Solomons that lies in this ironic Gulf to the west of Attica between Attica and Negara Athens and mega row will contest the control of Solomon's for some time and fight each other over it.

Speaker 1:          00:06:57       And on this occasion sometime here in the seventh century probably towards the end of the Seventh Century Athens conquers Solomon's and populated with the Athenians. It's it's it's it's not really a a colony in the sense that these outpost Kii I described for you are. It simply becomes part of Attica as do all the subdivisions in Attica. But it's the first occasion that we see of the physical expansion of the Athenian polis which is indicative of the kind of stuff we've been talking about elsewhere as well. And yet another sign takes place about the same time end of the 7th very early in the 6th century the establishment of the first overseas colony by the Athenians at a place called the CGM across the GNC just at the entrance to the Dardanelles to the hellish pond. And that is not an accident I think because that route through the hellish spot through the Sea of Marmara through the Bosphorus and into the Black Sea will as Athens develops economically become the most critical trade route for Athens indeed.

Speaker 1:          00:08:16       After a while when Athens has developed a mixed economy and become and its population grows it becomes dependent on that route for supplying it with the grain that it needs as the staple of life for its people. So this is a first little step towards a very important development for Athens in the future. And I guess the reasons for it late. And less pressing than in the other places. But they must be the same. To some considerable degree hunger for land which means that there is a growing population that needs additional land and also because of the location of it. It's inescapable I think that they are also thinking that early of commercial considerations. And it turns out that there were very great commercial opportunities in that direction. So we've seen a number of signs of change moving Athens in the direction that the other Greek states were moving.

Speaker 1:          00:09:23       Which brings us in the early 6th century to the first. I think it's I think I've said this before but I want to say it again to the first truly living human being that we come across probably in all of Greek history certainly in that of Athens. So on whom we think of as the great law giver for reasons that you've read about. And I'll tell you about in a moment anyway. The reason he is so much we can speak of him as a human being because he wrote those poems from which I read you some expert excerpts the other day. And that poem tells us something about him and about the world in which he lived and will and of course we have many many stories about him because he was very well remembered as a critical individual in the history not only of Athens but in Greece.

Speaker 1:          00:10:18       The Greeks later put together a list of the Seven Sages seven wise men of the archaic period in Greek history and so long is one of the Seven Sages. Indeed one of the problems about knowing the truth about what solong did is that it's pretty clear that lots of stories that had nothing to do with so long were attached to so on in later ages because he was the prominent figure that everybody had heard about and knew something about. And so it isn't easy to know if somebody says so long did this or so long said that whether he really did. We can only try to sort of figure it out as best we can. But that's a special problem we have about him.

Speaker 1:          00:11:06       Now what comes becomes apparent as soon as we examine the things that brought so long to the fore is that Athens is clearly suffering a very serious internal problem as we get to these years by the way the traditional date for so long's appointment as sole Arkan in these years is five ninety four B.C.. Again we don't have to take that literally but it tells you we're really talking about the very beginning of the sixth century. Here's the picture as it is depicted by so long himself in his poems but also in the work of Herodotus and other later writers the crisis in its most acute form takes the shape of Athenians who have been enslaved. Some of them have not only been enslaved and live in Attica as slaves but some of them have been sold abroad and stolen tells us that some of them have been abroad so long they have forgotten the Athenian language so that we have to have a picture in which this this problem is one of some duration.

Speaker 1:          00:12:30       We have to imagine it's at least a couple of generations old. In order for that to make any sense. But it reaches its peak around the time I'm talking about and it's this that how did they get to be slaves. This is not a case where people had always been slaves. These are not people who were brought from somewhere else as slaves. These are not people who were conquered and made slaves by the conquerors. These are Athenian citizens who used to be free and have become slaves and the answer to how they became slaves is through debt. People were borrowing money and obviously failing to pay it back. And at a certain point they couldn't borrow money on the basis of something they could offer as a surety for the loan. If they had land that would have been gone by now if they had movable products or movable possessions that would have been gone all they had left to give was the person and probably I hate to tell you this my friends but the reality is reality.

Speaker 1:          00:13:39       Probably the first thing they did was to give their children as a surety for the loan and when the loan was not met the children became slaves of the person who had lent them money and very at some point probably this even happened to grown ups themselves so that a sufficient number of people had been so enslaved as to create a very general problem. The story is that apart from direct slavery there was another form of farming by very poor people that was led to terrific misery. The term that the Greeks used for this was the heck tame or Roy which means one sixth men and scholars have argued about what does this mean that the. These were people who who had been so far into debt that they were essentially sharecroppers. And the question is did they keep one sixth of it. Did they keep five sixth.

Speaker 1:          00:14:44       I think anybody who knows anything about what's possible on a farm like this realizes it couldn't have been more than one sixth that they gave away because they didn't make enough. They wouldn't been able to stay alive but in any case these one sixth men were fundamentally sharecroppers under the control of the people to whom they owe the debt. And another aspect of this thing was that the lands that were mortgaged in effect were the mortgage was shown by a stone that had the mortgage inscribed on it and placed on the soil. They were called poor Roy and so the seeing the hall rise spares scattered all over the fields were indicative of the pitiful lot of the poor farmers who had fallen into debt during this period. Well scholars also had a fantastic time trying to figure out how this came about and I never found anything that seemed satisfactory to me based on looking at the sources or reading people's interpretations until once again.

Speaker 1:          00:15:53       My hero Victor Hanson came on down the road and he's a man of honor. It's just amazing how much that helps him understand farmers and I like his interpretation of how things got that way. So let me give you a quick rundown of how that work. Remember these these times are the times and fundamentally of a growth of farming skill growth farming return people making living on areas farm farmland that they could never have made a living on before because they've learned how to grow the olive and grow the vine and make olive oil and make wine and have reclaimed land from which had not been useful for farming in the past. And that's how they got into trouble because for one thing farmers don't all succeed in any society. There are farmers who try to be good farmers and fail and they fail sometimes through their own shortcomings and they fail sometimes because nature is not kind to them.

Speaker 1:          00:16:55       Luck is always part of the game in farming. But what happens is that they get into trouble because things don't go well. They start out they have a crop and the crop doesn't do well. So they need money for next year both to make it through the winter and also to have seed for the following year. So what they do is have to borrow that money. And if the next crop is bad too. Well there you go. And you can see the whole process unraveling. I think that's probably the way it came about. According to Hansen the majority of the farmers were not so affected. They were doing OK. It was the losers who were the ones who were suffering these things. But there were enough losers so that this was a very serious problem. Now this rejects other earlier theories that for instance that the soil of Attica had become exhausted through over cropping and so on.

Speaker 1:          00:17:58       If Hansen is right this is less likely to be true than it used to be because there's more diversity. Diversification of farming than there had been in the past. And another another theory is that a cause of the problem was deforestation. Well it's perfectly true that Athens was severely deforested in the course of the centuries so that plateau could comment on how this deforestation had denuded Athens of trees by the fourth century. But there's no reason to think that that was happening especially during the time of so long very probably that deforestation hadn't gone that far and in any case its connection to problems of the farmland are less clear than they might be. Here's what Hansen finally concludes about it. He says the crisis was a natural evolutionary process of success and failure a subtle transformation that occurs when there are fundamental changes in land use and a growing population and that seems to me to be the most satisfactory account of how the Athenians got into that fix.

Speaker 1:          00:19:14       But in that fix they were there's no question about it. So the question was what is to be done. Now the pressure to do something about it I think is twofold. Of course inherently Athenians would have been bothered by all of this. Even those who were not the ones who did the suffering. But it's amazing how we all are able to bear the suffering of our neighbor if we are not suffering too. However the second element I think that put pressure on everybody was next door and Negara when things had gone bad for the poor. There was a revolution and the tyranny was established. And so it was down the road in Corinth. And so it was a little further down the road and so on so that the dominant people the satisfied people the people who like things as they were were worried that if they didn't solve their socio economic problem they would find themselves confronting a tyranny because after all that's what Keelan had in mind back 30 thirty five years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:20:19       And the danger was ever present. And I think that is what you need to have in your mind. The threat of tyranny was the great element that made chances or attempts at reform necessary and allowed the Athenians to give things a try that they would never have thought of before. And so what they finally decided to do was to select from among themselves. One Athenian who would replace all the nine icons of the usual government of Athens and be given the job of soul are Kahn for one year and he would be allowed to legislate for the Athenians as a way out of the trouble they were in. Now think of how how desperate things must be. And one aspect of that desperation I think we have to believe is that there was no way they could have put together a coalition of citizens who would have been sufficiently unified sufficiently public spirited to trust with such an activity that anybody that we have to believe that there were sufficient differences of interest on the part of different elements in the society that would have made that impossible.

Speaker 1:          00:21:49       Otherwise you don't do this kind of thing. It is worth pointing out that something like So London's soul our ship is heard of about the same time in Greek history. In other towns sometimes they appointed somebody they called an ICM they chase somebody who is supposed to be the guy who settle things for them. So it's an idea that came obviously naturally to the Greeks but we ought to recognize what an extraordinary thing it really is. They chose so long. Why did they choose so long. He obviously was reputed to have the kinds of characteristics which would make him a competent intelligent wise fair person to do this kind of thing. He had achieved fame notoriety by his military activity. He had led in the war against McGarry ends and had fought very well. And it was out of that military achievement that he became well known and then his other characteristics obviously were also well-known.

Speaker 1:          00:22:59       If you read his poems you realize he was a man who knew how to express himself and to persuade others of what he had in mind and that his approach was one that was popular. We should keep in mind what's going on here. First of all we are told he was a man. We have contradictory stories. And I think I can understand how the contradiction arose. One story says he was a nobleman coming from extremely famous important ancestors. The other speaks of him as a man of the middle rank which doesn't really work out. With that I think best explanation I can come up with that is that he undoubtedly was a person of noble birth. In that kind of society only such a person was likely to be looked to for a position of leadership. But I think what may have persuaded folks. Well he also couldn't have been fabulously wealthy but certainly he was not a poor man. But what I think convince people that he was of the middle rank was that his message and the propaganda that he sent out in his poems and indeed the character of the reforms that he proposed were very much moderate.

Speaker 1:          00:24:17       That's the word that came to be the one so much admired and favored and sought by the Greek people. Keep in mind this is the period in Greek history when the Delphic Oracle has come to the height of its influence in the Greek world and in the surrounding world as well. And the oracle of Apollo at Delphi was the most famous place that was putting forward the idea of moderation. The Greek word is soft Rawson a self-control and moderation. And you remember the messages at the Delphic oracle. Know thyself meaning don't imagine that you are more than a man but that you are merely a man and don't do anything in excess. Moderation was what should be sought weeks never stopped worshiping at the shrine of moderation for the rest of their history. Cynical men say the Greeks were so in love with moderation because it was so rare among them.

Speaker 1:          00:25:28       But I think it's rare among all of us. So here was someone who was the spokesman of that very powerful mode of thinking that was pervading the Greek world at the time and no doubt he gave it a great step forward with the things that he did and the things that he said. Okay let's look at a few of the things that he did. I'm picking out things that I pretty sure really were so lonely and there were others that attributed to him that are more debatable but the most basic problem is what are we going to do with these people who are losing their property have lost their property have lost their freedom. What's to be done about that agricultural problem we've been talking about. And so. So Len introduced the measure which is called in Greek the cease fire. Fortunately you have it on your computers and you've all copied it down and taken it to class so you can study these things right.

Speaker 1:          00:26:28       Don't answer that. That measure abolished all debts that were based on the body of the person that is that that were the surety given was the body of the borrower. Any debt that was so incurred was abolished cancelled on the other hand there was no general cancellation of debts. In other words any normal debt that didn't have that characteristic continued. Another thing that the poor and the unhappy would have liked. They would have like General cancellation of debt I should point out. Whenever you have lower class discontent in the Greek world there are two things that they typically ask for. One is abolition of debt because they're always in debt. And the second thing is redistribution of the land now redistribution of the land means civil war. Nobody is going to allow his land to be taken away from him and given to somebody else without a fight.

Speaker 1:          00:27:36       And so if you go for that what you're going to have to do is to have armed force to achieve it and you're going to end up with a tyranny because that's the kind of thing tyrants are more likely to do. So he avoided that and he did not permit redistribution of the land. If you just look at that land question for a moment and the debt bondage question you can see that it is indeed the moderate position in between the view of those the poor the enslaved indebted who wanted these radical changes and the old aristocracy who would have preferred to just leave things as they were instead so long came through with this middling program which and by the way apparently there was we don't know how well this was done but apparently they brought back Athenians who had been enslaved abroad also.

Speaker 1:          00:28:34       So there must have been some expenditure of funds somehow they must have collected it from somebody and brought them back. But the most important thing is what's done right there in Attica. And of course to what all of this does is to settle down the situation for the moment but it does not guarantee that these very same problems that produced the difficulty we're talking about would not reappear in the future and I think as we look at this measure it's already a clue to most everything that's characteristic of the slowness in reforms. They are moderate and therefore unsatisfactory. That is they don't solve the problems that are there. But that doesn't mean they are not worth anything. For one thing they ameliorate the problem. And therefore the ameliorate the discontent and the danger to the freedom of the Athenians. But they also sometimes set the stage for the elimination of the problem over time because ways are found obviously for people to manage these things if the possibility of debt slavery is taken away in other forms of managing these things will assert themselves.

Speaker 1:          00:29:57       And indeed what we find. And I must say what I'm going to tell you doesn't solve the mystery. But what we find as you get to the fifth century the classical period in Athens is an extraordinary situation because it's so good and so unusual. And that is that most Athenian farmers in the fifth century seemed to have small but adequate family farms that allow many many many Athenians to live in a very satisfactory way given the expectations that they had it never abolished great big land holding arrangements that some people had. There always were throughout Athenian history no matter how thoroughly Democratic state became. There always were great differences of wealth between very wealthy people and very poor people. But what is extraordinary and what would have been very satisfactory to the Greek political thinkers even the Aristotle for instance in the fourth century is that there was a great middle ground in which the people were pretty much like each other in their economic condition which produces the greatest stability the greatest satisfaction the greatest capacity for self-government.

Speaker 1:          00:31:25       So that was one of the consequences although it didn't happen as any direct action by Solana We are also told by Aristotle and other ancient sources that so changed the coin standard for Athens from one that was used in the West in the Peloponnese US and in the West to one that was used in the east and they changed the way from the the. I don't even measures if I don't even coin standard to the you Bolek standard which as people try to understand why and how that would work it would have made trade with the Aegean and the east better. And of course we know that that's the area that the Athenians are exploiting vigorously now although we must recognize it when the Athenians get rolling in the trade business they do tremendously well in the West as well. But there's a bigger problem with the story about these coins than any other. As you know if what I told you before the almost universal opinion of coin experts is how could he change the coin standards. There weren't any coins yet. Now you're really going to believe them are you going to believe Aristotle. You know where I am. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:49       In other steps that turned out to be very important in the long run. He encouraged the use of the not of the use of the land for the purpose of producing cash crops like olive oil and wine and the Athenians do use more and more of their soil largely because there's more and more of their soil that can grow that and nothing else but as they do the consequence is to make the agricultural output of Athens much more diversified than it had been which saves you know more diverse your crops the less chance you have to be wiped out in any one year by bad results and it is matter of fact over time it became a very satisfactory device and helps explain again the health of Athenian agriculture when we see it in the fifth century and later another thing that he did you know I should I'm gonna talk about citizenship for a moment.

Speaker 1:          00:33:55       The Greek police were very jealous of their citizenship. Their theory of the polls was that all citizens were the descendants of the original founders of the city. In other words everybody in Athens was a relative of some kind. Of course it wasn't true. Certainly in Athens we know there were many immigrants and so on. But the fact remains that that was the normal thinking about it and the notion of the power the sent tragedy of the concept of Polis to them is something we need to understand and that they were jealous of it and selfish with it. This was not something they would simply allow people to acquire if they wanted it this place is us and it's not them. And we don't make people citizens. And that was essentially the thing to be a citizen of Athens in those days you had to have a father who was a citizen of Athens.

Speaker 1:          00:34:56       Nothing else would do the trick. But someone changed that. So long offered citizenship to individuals who came to Athens to settle and had a say could could show that they had a valuable skill a valuable craft and the results were that Athens would become in the decades following so long a great center for the manufacturing of a variety of things. Pottery is what we have and great painting painted pottery is a great part of the Athenian tradition. But sculpture also and all kinds of things that we probably don't have because they would have been destroyed by time. But the idea was if you were a skilled craftsman you could become you come to Athens and you would not have to be what you would otherwise be. Anybody who came to Athens not under these rules would could stay could make up himself a permanent resident but he would always be what the Greeks called a Met oil costs.

Speaker 1:          00:36:07       We say in English a metric meaning a resident alien never to be a citizen. Only citizens were permitted to own land in Attica only citizens had access to the Athenian courts a noncitizen who had to go to court for one reason or another would have to find a citizen to be his spokesman. So you really were cut off from somewhere and of course a noncitizen could not participate in the political life of Athens either but these people were not going to be medics because of the economic skills that they brought so long arranged for them to become Athenian citizens. Very rare thing. We will have a couple of other occasions in this course until then take a look at a moment when foreigners were permitted to come to Athens and become citizens. But they're very rare. And there's always something very special connected with them.

Speaker 1:          00:37:03       And there will always be some Athenians who will raise at least one eyebrow at the idea of making a foreigner a citizen of Athens. But it turned out to be one of those things that have that so on instituted that would have long range consequences helpful to the Athenian state well so much for the economic and social issues. Let's turn to the constitutional questions because of course by when you're talking about an independent republic then the political and constitutional arrangements are obviously critical to everybody. I guess it's true in any society but it's blatant in a republic. So someone changed the Athenian constitution up to this moment the Athenian constitution came to be what it was in the way that these things happen in nature namely through tradition. They just kind of grow. Nobody nobody legislates but so on was appointed to legislate. And he was going to attempt to deal with the problems that he saw.

Speaker 1:          00:38:11       So what he did first of all was to arrange Athenian political society on a new basis. This is a very large matter up to now where you were in the state whether you could serve on the council whether you could be a magistrate dependent upon your birth aristocrats alone could hold these positions. Now that was swept away by Solana's new system he changed it so that the determination of who was eligible to serve in these councils and offices was based on the wealth that they had just to show you. And this is an argument against the coinage being present in that day. He did not fix the rating of Citizens for these jobs in money. He rated them in measures of agricultural produce whether dry produce or liquid produce equally available. These measures of produce were called medium Noi measures. So here's how we worked it out at the top of the scale.

Speaker 1:          00:39:26       There were five. You had to have each year products produced by your land which were worth five hundred Madame Noi at least. So the people who held in that position that condition were described as get ready. This is a job breaker Pentecost CEO Madame Noi which just means five hundred measurement. That is obviously a new term a new concept didn't exist before so it makes no sense. So someone had to invent that to take care of a certain class of people that he wanted. But the next class down was probably almost certainly used for a condition that was already recognized but didn't have a formal place in the Constitution. People with three hundred measures a year but not five hundred were called hip pace meaning cavalryman. I use that term in another place before and then people with two hundred measures but not three hundred were zoo Gotye yoke fellow as you remember yoke men and then those below two hundred were feats and they were the lowest class in the Athenian Society invented by someone again that was an old term the only one that he invented was the Pentecost yo Madam NOI and of course the critical thing about it more whatever else I say about this the important thing it broke the monopoly of aristocrats by birth in the political realm the first two classes Pentecostal home Adam NOI and hip pace could hold the Archon ships and only they.

Speaker 1:          00:41:10       Now the Zuber tie as I think I mentioned to you before were essentially the hop like class that meant they could not hold the top jobs in the state on the other hand he established a council of four hundred the word for council in Greek is bu Lei so this bu lay of 400 Xu Gotye could serve on that and we we never will really know what the powers of that council were because it doesn't seem but as we shall see so once Constitution was never really put into effect in all its respects although this business about the measures was put into effect but I think we can guess by analogy to other councils that it would have had considerable power that it would have decided many things would not have been an empty honor to be on the Council of 400 nor were the seats excluded from political power entirely they of course made up a part of the assembly the Greek word is a clay C up and that there was certainly a net Clay C before so long you always in any state that we know of in the Greek world if you want to go to war you must go to the army now the seats didn't fight as hot lights but they could fight as light on the troops so I'm sure they were consulted although it was pretty much a formality nonetheless that's not no but what is new and extremely important is that so on invents a new kind of court it is cold in.

Speaker 1:          00:42:58       The heli Aya and what it is is a court of appeal all this time before every magistrate as I believe I mentioned had a court of his own that dealt with matters that were appropriate to his court. And that was the end of it. I suppose theoretically and probably in reality sometimes if somebody didn't like what a magistrate decided in the court he could go to the area of us and in very rare occasions I would imagine Gary octopus could do something about it. But I think what we have to assume is that a decision by the magistrate's court was it and the game was over heli Aya. On the other hand was a court of appeals. That's critical. Anybody who didn't like the decision that he got in a magistrates court could take it to a heli IO and then have that decision overturned.

Speaker 1:          00:43:58       If the court so decided and that court was a truly popular court it was open to all adult male Athenian citizens even the seats. That is something very new really quite radical. The most radical elements surely in this very moderate program that that so long puts forward notice. He still gives the aristocracy privileges that nobody else has in the right to hold the I say aristocracy but I mean the richest people in the state in that they alone can hold the arcane ship which would have been troubling to the poor. But then he gives this new founded court of appeals to the poorest Athenian citizens which would certainly have rankled the rich. And that's characteristic of what he is up to this court. Here's the way it. Every year Athenians could volunteer to be enrolled in the panel that would produce the courts of the heli.

Speaker 1:          00:45:11       And the number of Athenians on on this panel was six thousand. And then on any occasion when there had to be an actual court case then the members people on the on the enrolled list there would be some way of picking the numbers you needed for the jury. We know how it worked in the classical period but we can't be sure it work the same way. And so lunch time. But in the classical period it's a very complicated way of choosing jurors which was a. But such a wonderfully complicated allotment device that it guaranteed that nobody would know who was going to sit on a particular jury until they walked into the room and began to hear the case and that was to avoid corruption of a jury. So whether that system was in play or not I don't think it was in the detail.

Speaker 1:          00:46:04       And so on time the idea should be clear. These things are really going to be unfixable and ordinary Athenians are going to be the ones who are making the decisions later theoreticians of politics of democracy would fix on that as the single most important step towards democracy that the Athenians would ultimately reach. But by no means would Solon's constitution if it had been put into effect have amounted to a thoroughgoing democracy. And yet the tradition always was there that so long had done something democratic because as you go into the fourth century people looking back without any real good knowledge of what went on back in those days. Some of them listed so long as the founder of Democracy. But it's also true that the general on understanding was not wrong about this because there was the same tradition at the same time that it wasn't the same kind of democracy we have now in the fifth century.

Speaker 1:          00:47:08       It is it was less democratic and that I think those traditions were correct. But moderation again is the example of what I'm talking about. Well brilliant marvelous someone was so clever he realized that when you're a moderate the wonderful achievement of a moderate person is that everybody is dissatisfied because the guys on that end are unhappy in the guise of our own that they're unhappy. And so he knew that they would immediately be efforts to overthrow what he had done. And so he one of his stipulations was that the Athenians would have to leave his laws unchanged for ten years. And he also knew that his own life would be extremely uncomfortable hanging around Athens while everybody came and said What the hell did you do so long. And so he left town and we're trapped went on his travels for ten years after that.

Speaker 1:          00:48:10       Well it saved him a lot of grief but it didn't save his legislation. Because there was tremendous strife in Athens after the year of Solon's ship. Indeed something resembling chaos. I think they were technically years of anarchy. That is to say there was so much dispute and conflict in Athens that they were unable to elect the nine hour cons just years with no outcomes no name for the year. That was how serious the conflict was and what emerges in our records about what was happening is that localism regionalism was very powerful in Attica and it was regionalism that was a large part of the problem in this period. Important figures in the aristocracy from different parts of Attica each sought to make itself the dominant force in Athenian society and to bring about changes that were satisfactory to them but they ran into the fact that they had competition to make it more complicated wasn't even a nice one against one thing. There were three factions that were identified by the Greeks and by the Athenians and they all struggle one against the other.

Speaker 1:          00:49:39       Let's start with the regional character of these places one such region was called the people in their faction. Let me back up. The region was called Peralta and the people who were in the factional called parolee ie pro rally oi modern scholars identify the parolee with the southern tip of Attica starting some distance up from Sunni him on the West Coast and carrying a little bit around to the east coast. And that was a region that was dominated by that family I've mentioned to you earlier that then family that was held responsible for the killing of the supporters of Kyla. That family was the alchemy on day and their leading figure at the moment we're talking about was a man called Mega Cleaves who was one of the competitors for the leading position in Attica.

Speaker 1:          00:50:47       According to the ancient writers of the fourth century very hard to know how much they really knew about it it's a matter of speculation. But anyway what they say is these people wanted a middling moderate constitution. They were probably very close to trying to retain the slowness in legislation. Another faction were called the PDR coy and they represented the middling part of Attica which is in fact the very best land in Attica where the grain and wheat especially were global and the richest people had their land. Their leader was a man named like Fergus and they represented the old aristocracy more than any other group and would have undoubtedly if they'd had their way just undone the colonial laws and gone back to the old days they favored some kind of oligarchic regime and then the third group lived in the region called D Korea and they were called the cream boy.

Speaker 1:          00:52:07       Sometimes some of our sources say who parent Ackroyd. I'll come back to that in just a moment. Well Miles we'll talk about it now. It is identified with the region on the east coast of Attica and which was called the Democracy. But it's why they might have been called Hooper our Chris why is that there were some mountains between central Attica and the Acharya which meant so that. I mean beyond the mountains. And that would have been a geographical description of the region. It's the leader of this faction was a man called Pi sister Tess who was as matter of fact he was a nobleman an aristocrat. All of them were but he his family had come from the Peloponnese as back in the years of the Great Migration following the fall of the Meissen the world. And that shows you that the Athenians had brought into their bosoms at that time and made full citizens and aristocrats and leading people some people from outside of Attica.

Speaker 1:          00:53:25       Now it was hundreds of years later and persisted as a rose as the leader of that place and of those people. Now he's gonna be very important we need to say a few more words about him. In the quarrel about what shall be done what should be done by Sister this and his group with the most radical. They represented the views of the poorest people in Attica and pressed for solutions of the kinds that they would like himself had risen to power in the usual way. He had been a great soldier and had won great victories for the Athenians and was deeply honored. For that reason and we'll hear more from him. Ancient writers speak of him as de Motta Coke to toast the most demotic the most popular the most democratic if you will. So here are the three factions with their local places with their different policies presumably in their different leaders all struggling for power and sufficiently equal in strength so that nobody could come out on top.

Speaker 1:          00:54:41       Out of this. And by the way when on comes home and the situation is as unsatisfactory as I've described so long as becomes particularly worried about my sister this whom he has spotted as a potential tyrant and he goes out and he warns the people against my sister this but the fact of the matter is he fails and his warnings and his predictions turn out to be accurate as pie sister this does bring about tyranny in Athens for the stretch of time that he and his sons will dominate the place he was engaged in that war against Negara and was the number one hero in that war. He was wounded and when he came back he said that he was in danger from his enemies who were going to try to kill him. And he asked the people to supply him with a bodyguard. They did so and he pretty quickly took the opportunity to use his bodyguard to seize the Acropolis and to make himself the boss of Athens for a five year stretch from about five sixty one to five fifty six.

Speaker 1:          00:56:02       He was able to rule Athens. We know very little about the details of that period. But he was a proper tyrant one way or another. Then his the two factions that were defeated managed to get their heads together to plot and to overthrow the tyranny to drive by system it is out. So he goes for a period of time he goes abroad. He wanders around meets with other important people goes to see other tyrants becomes friendly with other tyrants finds one way or another to make a lot of money and to get very rich. This is important because he is able to use this money for hiring mercenary soldiers which will play a large part in his restoration but not the first restoration that comes about because of the two factions that had gotten together to drive him out had by now come to quarrel with one another and so taking advantage of their dissent.

Speaker 1:          00:57:12       He made a deal with one of the faction leaders. It was our old friend Meghan Cleese the alchemy in it and now united with mega Achilles. The two of them drove out their opponents in the form of like Kirkus and his people and persistence this was restored to the tyranny. Why did Maggie please get out of it. Well he got guarantees that he would be a big shot and one part of the guarantee was that by Sister those who had had a wife and children already. I assume she died the first wife now married the daughter of Megan please in time immemorial. That's the way to produce political associations. Marry the one and one guy marries the other one's daughter. So there we are now the story of how my sister is coming back to power in this second time is charming and I think we have to believe it in its general outlines.

Speaker 1:          00:58:16       Well you can decide whether you want to or not. The story is told in a couple of places but Aristotle and his Athenian Constitution tells it in one way my sister's got a tall beautiful girl. And he dressed her up to look like Athena and he put her on a chariot and had her drive through the attic countryside and people his boys running alongside her shouted Athena is bringing back pies sister us to Athens. Well you're not going to cross your patron Didi are you. And so they all sort of you can imagine them just sort of kowtowing and saying Heil My sister is the favorite of Athena Well the fact that he had a lot of soldiers and that he had the mega clays on his side undoubtedly played a large part in the success. But there he is back and everything would have been all right I guess except that after a while BAE Systems let me back up a step by system.

Speaker 1:          00:59:35       This is wife the daughter of Megan please began going home to her father and mother and telling him the sad stories. She said her husband was not performing his husband's lead duties. Why was this. Was she particularly offensive. No there's no such record as that it's clear enough that what was worrying persist to this was that he did not want to mess up the clarity of the succession of his sons to the tyranny. If he had children with Megan please and they grew up maybe they would contest the succession. And so it was for his I guess you'd have to say it was in his role as a loyal and devoted father that he got himself into all kinds of trouble. Well Meghan please felt a the insult be the fact that his grandchildren would not be in charge. And finally I have to believe even in a Greek father feeling that his daughter had been done wrong and so he joined up with the opposition kicked out by Sister this one more time in this second exile of five sisters.

Speaker 1:          01:00:49       We. He goes to various places to raise all kinds of money gets mercenaries. He is supported by and this will play a role in later events. He gets very friendly with the cavalryman the horsemen the nobility of a red area a town in the northern part of the island of Nubia just off the east coast of Attica. And by the way of course remember persisted as comes from that area the east coast of Attica and regionalism will not disappear from Attica for some time and that is significant. Anyway he gets all kinds of help from overseas and his wealth and all that. And this time he's just going to fight his way back no tricks no goddesses. He lands at Marathon which has the advantage to him of being very close to UBS where he's been operating with his friends in the rhetoric. It also has a nice flat place for cavalry and I'm sure he acquired cavalryman among the mercenaries that he hired.

Speaker 1:          01:01:55       All of that allows him to get his forces together and sure enough when he lands at marathon that's his home territory and all his people come rallying round to him and now he has a good sized army of Athenians and mercenaries and he marches inland and in the middle land of Attica at a place called Bellini. He meets his opponents and defeats them in battle and makes himself the tyrant of Athens once again. And one of the things he does by a trick. Very soon after coming to power is to disarm the Athenian people so that he is now ruling in a truly tyrannical way. In that sense there's not much of a pretense at having achieved this position by the popular will. He's done so by force and trickery and he's prepared to maintain his his power in those ways but in his actual government of Attica and Athens in the remainder of his life tradition is pretty clear that he did not rule harshly.

Speaker 1:          01:03:11       If you think of the word tyrannical as meaning harsh he did not rule too radically. In fact later writers described the way he ruled Athens and it's this last period that they're talking about I think as one that was politic costs meaning moderately and in accordance with the way a polis should be run. Which does not include tyranny. And in fact some later writers picture of the rule of pipe sister cities as a golden age in Athens. We'll come back to that perhaps but there you have it. There are two edges to this thing there's the notion my God establish a charity which later on in Athens would be the worst thing in the world you could do. And yet there's this alongside it this tradition of a decent government under my system. Well let's see what he did. One thing he did was not to repeal the laws of so long they may never have been put into full effect because of the turmoil but no one had ever said that not the law anymore. In fact by system this let them be and in fact he allowed them to function as they should in other words I would think that there was a council of 400 that was elected every year and met there. We know there were magistrates. There are cons elected in the appropriate way each year.

Speaker 1:          01:04:40       Translate the law courts even met in the way that they were supposed to but what persisted as did was not to change the Constitution but to dominate it. I think you have to imagine that there is the rule of a boss. He doesn't change the laws. He just sees to it that all the appropriate bodies are controlled by his people. That for an analogy is the way the mandatory governed in Florence when they made themselves the rulers of that republic. It is true. You can't be just totally gentle. You have to take care of your enemies because they're going to be enemies out there. So my sister is surely exiled some aristocratic families the ones who wouldn't cut a deal with him. The ones who wouldn't play ball out they went and we know that for some part of the time we don't know just when he exiled the alchemy and it's of course he had this quarrel with mega clique so that was not a surprise and they could not readily be made complacent.

Speaker 1:          01:05:52       What was going on. Although we do have this is remarkable we have an actual inscription which is blatantly a list of our cousins who were held office in Athens and after my sister this is death in the period when his sons ruled Athens one of the names as Arkan of the city was Kleist Denise who was in alchemy it which means makes it perfectly clear that at least later in the day the out minutes came back into Attica. We have to imagine that by system this rule this thing with great savvy and there was always time to come home if you will be a good boy and do what my sister told you to do. And I think that happens in many cases.

Speaker 1:          01:06:44       One of the things he did it was very popular was to invent the institution of circuit judges. That is to say it used to be that if you were an Athenian citizen then you wanted to go to law. Originally of course you had no choice but to go to the local big shot and have this local aristocrats settle the matter as had been the case in the days of he said. But under Solon's system at the very least you could go to the magistrate in Athens if you wanted to and you could even appeal to his decision if you wanted to. But here's the problem what if you lived in Sunni and you lived miles and miles and miles away from this. What are the chances that you would in fact or could go to the city to receive the justice that you needed. So by establishing circuit justice brought courts that were objective that were not dominated by the local barons. He was doing a real service to the ordinary Athenian citizen and that was seen to be a good thing. But it was also of course in his interest. He doesn't want local big shots being big shots. There's only room in the tyranny for one big shot. And that is the tyrant. And so he's doing his. He's serving himself breaking down local power unifying the state into a single thing which is good in all kinds of ways but it's also good for the tyrant.

Speaker 1:          01:08:20       Now the next thing I'm going to say is supposition. We don't have any ancient evidence for it and its course is open to doubt. But I would argue that he must have confiscated some of the land of the aristocrats who opposed him and with whom he did not make a deal. And I say that pretty much only for this reason before my sister this we have the great story of great differences in land holding between very very big landowners and very very small lands and those who own no land at all producing the problem nothing so long did directly affected that situation. But when we get into the fifth century the evidence is overwhelming that we have what I see. But I spoke of earlier lots and lots of medium moderate family sized farms some big farms but these are not what are characteristic of the place.

Speaker 1:          01:09:25       Well how did that happen. When did that happen. My guess is probably past history has brought that about. And if so it would have been still another reason why he had broad popularity remarkable popularity. The ancient sources do tell us that among the things that he did was to spend money on farmers. That is he would give money or lend money to farmers who needed it when they needed it which is of course one of the issues constantly before the small farmers of Attica so they could with the money they borrowed they could buy more land make their farm more self-sustaining they could pay off debts that they owe to other people they could do the things that these small farmers have to do to succeed namely buy the equipment they need. Olive presses wine presses mills they should they could get use their loans for planting fruit trees olive trees all of these things could have been part of the story of how a Athenian agriculture came to be so so successful.

Speaker 1:          01:10:41       After the time of the tyrants as they had not been before. Now there's one negative thing that I'm sure nobody liked prices for this instituted the first regular direct tax that we know of in Athenian history a 5 percent tax on all that was produced from the land and that that money went to pay sister this made him wealthy but also provided him with the money he needed to beat his good fellow that I have been describing. So it all assisted his political power and his popularity. But even there that should have been the worst thing he ever did. Tyrants laid down taxes. Taxes are evidence of tyranny and all that. That's a totally the picture we get. Aristotle tells this story. One day my sister this was traveling around the countryside of Attica as a guest he sometimes did and he went up on the slopes of Mount high meadows not too far from the city of Athens.

Speaker 1:          01:11:45       You go up there today the notion of anybody farming on that mountain is totally incredible. Nothing you could possibly grow on Mountain Meadows but it's been deforested. By that time. So anyway it was an still lousy I mean mountains are not great places for farms. You may have noticed. So anyway it goes up to this farmer and he says say farmer what do you grow on your farm. The farmer you might have to imagine a gnarled old mean nasty old guy saying on my farm I grow rocks and my sister this is welcome to his 5 percent. Well that did my sister to stay off with his head or send him on to the moon. He said Well aren't you a cute little fellow. I hereby declare your farm exempt from taxes forever. And it became a famous thing that tax free farm. It shows up in a business teen encyclopedia. That story that is still being told. So that's you've got a very special kind of tie right here. We'll turn to the rest of his reign and that of his sons. Next time.
