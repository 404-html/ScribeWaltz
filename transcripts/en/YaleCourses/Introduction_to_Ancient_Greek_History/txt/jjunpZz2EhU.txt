Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Why aren't you all home like the rest of the class.

Speaker 2:          00:00:14       My subject today is parrot Cleaves as general. I don't expect that it will take up all our time. So if you like when I'm through I'd be glad to respond to any questions or comments that you want to make about the Peloponnesian War.

Speaker 3:          00:00:33       So if you're if you think of any as I'm talking I hope you'll have a shot at it. Near the end of his biography of Pericles Plutarch describes his great Athenian leader on his deathbed.

Speaker 4:          00:00:51       The best men of Athens and his personal friends are gathered in his room and are discussing the greatness of his virtues and the power he held. Thinking he was asleep. They added up his achievements and the number of his trophies.

Speaker 3:          00:01:11       For his general. He had set up nine commemorating a victory on behalf of the city. Now we are inclined to think of Pericles primarily as a great political leader a brilliant orator a patron of the Arts and Sciences the man who whose work in the peaceful arts shaped what is often called the Golden Age of Athens so it's useful for us to remember that the office to which the people elected him almost every year for some 30 years from which he carried on all of these activities was that of strata Goss general and that foremost responsibility of Athenian generals was to lead armies and navies into battle. From his own time until modern times Pericles talents as a general have been criticized and defended in the first year of the Peloponnesian War when his strategy called for the Athenians to huddle behind the walls of their city while the invading Peloponnesian army ravage their lands in Attica. Lucidity says the city was angry with Paris police they abused him because as their general he did not lead them out into battle and they held him responsible for all they were suffering in the next year after another invasion and destruction of their crops and farms.

Speaker 2:          00:02:47       And after a terrible plague had struck the city against acidity says they blame Pericles for persuading them to go to war and they held him responsible for their misfortunes. At a lower level the poet Herr MIPS one of the poets comic poets whose work we don't have but occasionally we have a quotation and here's one. Herr members present to one of his comedies in the spring of 430 the second year of the war that simply charged Paris Cleese with cowardice. He addresses Pericles as follows. King of the SAT here's why don't you ever lift a spear but instead only use dreadful words to wage the war. Assuming the character of the cowardly Teles. But if a little knife is sharpened on a whetstone you roar as though bitten by the fierce click on clean as you know was his major opponent in the last years of his life and Clinton was hawkish and an advocate of aggressive active fighting.

Speaker 2:          00:04:02       Now the title of this talk Pericles is general is also the name of the most vehement modern attack on Pericles. As a general I say modern of course I'm talking about the 19th century when you're an ancient historian. Things take on those proportions. The author Dr. Julius fun fluke Hartung was a veteran of the Franco Prussian war and an appreciative student of what he took to be the lessons taught by the great military historian and theorists theorist Clausewitz. He believed that he had acquired some useful knowledge of the science of war as he put it that led him vigorously and entirely to condemn Pericles as general generalship in Pericles conduct of the Peloponnesian War he says. We see expeditions without inner unity without the possibility of greater results. And I'm quoting Luke Hartung now to avoid danger. Pericles regularly gave away important advantages. Overall we find the effort to lose no battle but nowhere to win one as much as Pericles personal courage operated in battle and in the assembly. So little did he have the courage proper to a general which boldly risks the life of thousands at the decisive moment. As such he belongs to those. One may say a philosophical group which brings everything as neatly as possible into the system and plan. Instead of acting openly and vigorously. It is a fact that cleaves the chief advocate of the anti Spartan policy never offered a single battle against the Spartans at the higher level of strategy. The critique of Pericles is no less severe prickly is was a good minister of war.

Speaker 5:          00:06:09       Who made far sighted preparations but as General he did not know how to make good use of the existing situation. Again I quote He was a great booga Meister. This means mayor said it was not a very friendly thing to call the great general who led Athens. It was a great burger Meister. In the true sense of the word. There is the rich many sidedness of his nature which was then by that which came into play his superiority to corruption everything petty and paltry. Yet he lacked the prophet's vision and the certain luck of the born statesman. Above all he lacked the recklessness which is often needed to lead what has been what has begun to the goal. As the leader of foreign policy he was not comparable to a sin Mr. Cleese as a general not even approximately to Akeem on so that's the harshest of the critics of Pericles.

Speaker 5:          00:07:19       Over the years but Pericles has been very lucky over the years in his defenders in antiquity. His performance was justified and praised by lucidity. It was after all a contemporary general himself and the historian of the period whose interpretations have dominated opinion ever since he wrote for all the objectivity of the acidity style he tells the story very much from Pericles viewpoint. For instance when he describes the revolt against the Athenian leader in the second year of the war and the Athenians unsuccessful effort to make peace. This is how he describes the aftermath being totally at a loss as what as to what to do. They the Athenian people attack Pericles and when he saw that they were exasperated and doing everything as he had anticipated he called an assembly since he was still general. He wanted to put confidence into them and leading them away from their anger to restore their calm and their courage.

Speaker 5:          00:08:32       He reports three of Pericles that is to say Cincinnati's does reports three of Pericles speeches at length without reporting any of the speeches made by his opponents on those occasions with the result that the reader is made to see the situation through Pericles eyes. And finally he makes his own judgment perfectly clear coming down firmly and powerfully on the side of Pericles and against all of his critics here's what's to say that he says as long as he led the state in peacetime he kept to a moderate policy and kept it safe and it was under his leadership that Athens reached her greatest heights.

Speaker 6:          00:09:18       And when the war came and it appears that he also judged its power correctly Pericles lived for two years and six months after the war began and after his death his foresight about the war was acknowledged still more for he had said that if the Athenians stayed on the defensive maintained their navy and did not try to expand their empire in wartime thereby endangering the state. They would win out but they acted opposite to his advice in every way. And when their efforts failed they harm the state's conduct of the war. Now in spite of his success excuses of his successor's departure from his strategy and the disasters that resulted in spite of the entry of the Persian Empire into the enemy ranks the Athenians held out for ten years after the disastrous Sicilian expedition and for twenty seven years with interruption altogether here's what you said at his final word on this subject so more than abundant was parrot Cleaves reasons for his own predictions that Athens would have won in a war against the Peloponnesian along the city's makes it absolutely clear cities.

Speaker 6:          00:10:49       Apparently it was right in the strategy that he had adopted and if the Athenians had stuck to it they would have won the war. Plutarch accepted to sit in his judgment. And added further defense against the charges of cowardice and lack of enterprise that his enemies were launching against Pericles to Plutarch. The actions that provoked such into accusations instead revealed prudence moderation and a desire to protect the safety of Athenian soldiers in 454. We're back now. In the first Peloponnesian War Pericles led a sea borne expedition into the Corinthian Gulf. Facilities merely reports that he defeated the sick he only ends in battle and ravaged the territory and besieged the important city of anybody. Though he failed to take it and then sailed home obviously answering later criticism Plutarch concludes his account of these events by saying that Pericles returned to Athens and now I quote him having showed himself to be formidable to the enemy but a safe and effective commander to his fellow citizens for no misfortune struck the men on the expedition and 437 he sailed into the black sea on a mission of imperial consolidation that amounted to little more than showing the flag.

Speaker 6:          00:12:24       To the local barbarians an action that was too insignificant to be even noticed by its editors. But Plutarch does not miss the chance to meet the criticism that had been directed against his hero. On this campaign according to Plutarch Pericles displayed the magnitude of his forces and the fearlessness and confident courage with which they sailed wherever they liked and place the entire sea under their power and 446 when B OCA was in rebellion the bold and ambitious general told Mahdi's convinced the Assembly to send him at the head of an army to put down the uprising Plutarch reports that Pericles tried to restrain and to persuade him to in the Assembly making his famous remark. That if he would not listen to parents please he would not go wrong in waiting for time. The wisest counselor but told he didn't listen and he went. And the result was a disaster.

Speaker 6:          00:13:33       The Athenians suffered many casualties. Thomas's was kill B OCA was lost Plutarch comment is that this is an incident brought great fame and goodwill to Pericles as a man of prudence and patriotism. Later in the same year rebellion broke out in UBS. And Negara revolted. Opening the road for a Peloponnesian invasion of Attica. Pericles on this occasion had no choice he led an Athenian army out to meet the invading army. But instead of fighting a battle he convinced the Spartans to withdraw and then to negotiate a peace. In retrospect no doubt his critics accused him of missing a chance for victory in the field facilities reports the Peloponnesian withdrawal without comment or explanation. But Plutarch uses this action to respond in almost poetic language to later charges that accompany the Peloponnesian invasion in 431 reporting that his enemies Pericles enemies threatened and denounced him and choruses sang mocking songs to his shame and insulted his generalship for its cowardice and for abandoning everything to the enemy.

Speaker 6:          00:14:55       The Peloponnesian Plutarch tells us expected the Athenians to fight out of anger and pride but apparently as it appeared terrible to fight a battle against sixty thousand Peloponnesian and b ocean hotlines for that was a number of those who made the first invasion. I'm still quoting Plutarch and to state the city itself on the outcome he reports Pericles calming language to the XIV excited Athenians and 431 saying that trees though cut and lopped grew quickly. But if men were destroyed it was not easy to get them back again had he turned off. I'm sorry here he turned to the charges of cowardice and lack of enterprise and he turned them on their heads and did so more fully in a passage that sums up his view of Pericles generalship. And I'll read it to you in his generalship. He was especially famous for his caution.

Speaker 6:          00:16:00       He never will. He never willingly undertook a battle that involved great risk or uncertainty. Nor did he envy or emulate those who took great risks with brilliant success. And were admired as great generals. He always said to his fellow citizens that as far as it was in his power they would live forever and be immortals. Of the many modern scholars who have been persuaded by this view none has argued more forcefully in favor of Pericles generalship than Hunt's Del Brook. Perhaps the most renowned military historian of his day and still a respected figure in that field he he and Hartung were contemporaries. They lived in the well they did their writing on this subject in the last decades of the nineteenth century. Annoyed by by the critics critiques rather lately leveled at Pericles and especially by Flockhart John.

Speaker 6:          00:17:08       He wrote a thorough defense in 1890 under the title The General's ship of Pericles explained through the generalship of Frederick the Great. His main effort in that work is to justify Pericles conduct of the war that began in 431. The subject of the greatest criticism leveled at the Athenian general Pericles strategy did not aim at defeating the Spartans in battle but was meant to convince them that war against Athens was futile. His strategic goals therefore were entirely defensive he told the Athenians that if they would remain quiet take care of their fleet. Refrain from trying to extend their empire in wartime and so putting their city in danger they would prevail the Athenians were to reject battle on land abandon their fields and homes in the country to Spartan devastation and retreat behind their walls. Meanwhile their navy would launch a series of commando raids on the coast of the Peloponnese.

Speaker 6:          00:18:23       This strategy would continue until the frustrated enemy was prepared to make peace. The naval raids and landings were not meant to do serious harm but merely to annoy the enemy and to suggest how much damage the Athenians could do if they chose. The strategy was not to exhaust the Peloponnesian physically or materially but psychologically no such strategy had ever been attempted in Greek history for no state before the coming of the Athenian imperial democracy. Ever had the man the means for trying such a strategy. To do so was not easy for this unprecedented strategy was ran directly across the grain. As you know of Greek tradition willingness to fight. Bravery and steadfastness in battle became the essential characteristics of the free man and the citizen Pericles strategy of passivity. Therefore ran counter to the teachings of the Greek tradition.

Speaker 6:          00:19:34       But most Athenians were farmers whose lands and homes were outside the walls. The prickly and strategy required them to look on idly while their houses crops and vines and olive trees were damaged or entirely destroyed in the face of these facts as well as of the power of tradition and the cultural values of the Greeks. It is hard to understand even in retrospect how Pericles could convince the Athenians to adopt his strategy. Tilbrook keenly aware of Athens numerical inferiority on land. Was Convinced of the soundness of Pericles approach. Here's what Del Brooke wrote. The structure of the Peloponnesian War obliges us to give him a position not simply among the great statesmen but also among the great military leaders of world history. It is not his war plan as such that bestows this right on him for the fame of the commander is gained not by word but by deed but rather the gigantic power of decision that accompanied it not to haul with a half measure but to plunge in whole heartedly and to give up completely what had to be sacrificed the entire attic countryside. And in addition the strength of personal authority that was able to make such a decision understandable to a Democratic National Assembly and to gain their approval the execution of this decision is a strategic deed that can be compared favorably with any victory take that critics Delle Brook was pulling no punches.

Speaker 7:          00:21:31       And if you said he was a bum I say he was the greatest Del Brooke tries to bolster his case by comparing Pericles with Frederick the Great King of Prussia in the 18th century. During the seven years war Frederick applied Waddell Brook calls a strategy of exhaustion instead of the strategy of annihilation in which one army seeks out the other to bring it to decisive battle with the goal of destroying its nation's ability to resist such a strategy is sometimes adopted by or forced upon the weaker side in a conflict because no other choice promises success.

Speaker 2:          00:22:19       In the 20th century the North Vietnamese Communists used it with success against the United States superior firepower brought the Americans victory and set battles but was not so effective in dealing with various forms of guerrilla warfare. The Communists therefore usually avoided battles throughout the war. Continuing warfare over years without a decisive result fed division and discontent in America and ultimately exhausted the American will to fight. In the second Punic War Rome repeatedly suffered crushing defeats in battle at the hands of Hannibal. The Romans therefore chose the tactics of quinces Fabius Maximus avoiding battle harassing the enemy with guerrilla warfare until they grew stronger. And he far from home and cut off from it by sea grew weaker and was compelled to withdraw prickliness.

Speaker 6:          00:23:23       Strategy however was un like these strategies in many ways unlike the Vietnamese Communists and the Romans. He never attempted a set battle on land the Vietnamese war down America's resolve by inflicting casualties on their forces. The Romans avoided battle only sale so long as they had to. Their ultimate aim was to defeat the enemy in standard battles which finally they did. In Italy Spain and Africa Del Brook's comparison with Frederick strategy seems to me no less faulty the Prussian monarch was driven to it by combat losses in set battles fought over two years and by the absence of any alternative he needed to avoid battle to survive. Only good fortune not calculated war plans could save him Britain came to his aid with financial assistance and then the most incalculable of all things happened.

Speaker 2:          00:24:29       The death of the row of the room sorry the Russian empress who was a great fan of the. I mean who was hostile to Frederick broke up the coalition of his enemies allowing him to escape from the war unbeaten she was succeeded by a tsar who loved Frederick the Great and there by saved his neck.

Speaker 7:          00:24:52       The situation confronting Pericles was entirely different from these cases. No helpful allies stood in the wings and no fortunate accident came to divide his opponents since he avoided all fighting on land against the Spartans. He inflicted no casualties as the Vietnamese and the Romans did. They and Frederick moreover aimed finally at fighting and winning battles when the odds were in their favor.

Speaker 2:          00:25:24       The core of Pericles plan however was to avoid all land battles to show that the Palestinians could do Athens no serious harm and to exhaust them psychologically to make them see reason and understand that their efforts were futile and could not bring them victory his plan did not work the element of chance.

Speaker 7:          00:25:50       The unexpected and incalculable intervened against Pyrrhic leaves and against Athens in the form of the terrible plague that ultimately killed a third of the Athenian population. Of course all this encourage the pull up nations who refused to be discouraged and continue to fight. When Pericles died and for twenty nine the Athenian Treasury was running dry. His plan lay in ruins and there was no prospect for victory. Only when his successors turned to a more aggressive strategy did the Athenians level the playing field and achieve a position allow them to hold out for twenty seven years. And indeed on more than one occasion almost brought victory so it's not surprising that Pericles strategy and the prickly and the Peloponnesian War has brought criticism that raises questions about his capacity as a military leader even from sober and friendly scholars Garrow booze old very distinguished German historian. Regarded his strategy as fundamentally right. But even he thought that it was somewhat one sided and doctrinaire and in its execution it was lacking in energetic procedure and in the spirit of enterprise. That's from a very good friend Hermann Bentsen. As you can see the Germans have dominated this entire field of discussion. Defends the plan against its critics but concedes that the carrying out of the offensive part of the plan appears to modern viewers as not very energetic and resolute.

Speaker 6:          00:27:42       I'll say their influence no doubt these critics are by the knowledge that prickly successors took some actions that did not risk significant land battles or numerous casualties and yet produced important successes in the spring of four twenty five. The brilliant and daring general Damascus's conceived and executed a plan to seize and fortify the promontory of pylons at the south western tip of the Peloponnese is from there the Athenians could launch raids at will and encourage the escape or rebellion of the Hilux Spartans enslaved population his success. Panic. The Spartans who allowed several hundred of their troops to be trapped and captured on the island of Spectre readjust off pylons. The immediately proposed a peace which the Athenians then refused later in the same spring the insane Athenians seized and garrison the island of Cicero just off the south eastern tip of the Peloponnese and immediately began to launch raids against the mainland. To today's reports that the Spartans suffered what I think of as pretty much a nervous breakdown.

Speaker 7:          00:29:03       Here's the accounts facilities gift the Spartans sent garrisons here and there throughout the country deciding the number of hot lights by what seemed necessary at each place. In other respects they were very much on guard for fear that there would be a revolution against the established order. And from every direction a war rose up around them which was swift and defied precaution in military of affairs. They now became more timid than ever before since they were involved in a naval contest outside their normal conceptions of preparation for war.

Speaker 8:          00:29:42       And in this unaccustomed area they fought against the Athenians to whom the mission of an enterprise was always a loss in respect to what they had expected to achieve. In other words whatever victories the Athenians won however great they are always disappointed because they had expected more than that. At the same time the misfortunes that had struck them in such numbers unexpectedly and in such a short time caused great terror.

Speaker 6:          00:30:09       And they were afraid they Spartans were that another calamity might again strike them sometime like the one on the islands victory. For this reason they were less daring and going into battle and they thought that whatever they undertook would turn out badly because they had no self-confidence. As a result of having little previous experience with misfortune.

Speaker 8:          00:30:34       Let me just remind you of the enormous confidence with which they entered the war thinking that it would be no problem at all. All they had to do was walk into Attica and either the Athenians would come out to fight them as they had done the last time and be destroyed immediately or they would surrender rather than see their lands destroyed.

Speaker 9:          00:30:52       And look where to what they had been reduced not by apparently a strategy of exhaustion but by the rejection of that strategy and the effort at a more aggressive approach. In the light of results such as these it is natural to ask why did the enterprises that produced the need. I'm sorry that the enterprises that produced these successes why do they need to wait until the fifth year of the war. Why didn't Pericles use them at once. His failure to do so is the most weighty of the charges brought against him and Del Brook uses much effort and ingenuity to defend him. He is forced to concede however that a more aggressive offensive effort would have been helpful. He believes that the attack Pericles led against epic dowries in the second year of the war and 430 was meant to take and hold that city. Quote from Del Brooke if any such conquests had succeeded any success in at car Narnia any campaign of devastation.

Speaker 10:         00:32:02       However intensive any fortification of a coastal spot in Massena would disappear. In comparison taking up the dollars he says would have threatened the neighboring states near the coast. It might bring peace at once or at least cool the ardor for war amongst parties allies. So why did Pericles wait and then do so little Del Brooks answer is we do not know.

Speaker 7:          00:32:33       The failure by so learned clever and determined a scholar and by his many other defenders to explain Pericles behavior in this way I think is a powerful sign that they have taken the wrong path. Pericles did not mean to use any serious offensive measures to wear down the enemy's ability to fight. His goal as I have said before was psychological and intellectual to convince the Spartans and their allies that victory was impossible that the Athenians could easily sustain the only damage the enemy could inflict. The ravishing of Attica and to show that the ally to show to the allies. I'm sorry that the allies at the Athenians. Forgive me to show it to them and realize that the Athenians could do them considerable harm if they chose Athens carefully calculated limited offensive efforts were meant to deliver a message without inciting the enemy to fight and to fight harder. Just as the carefully calculated limited attacks by American forces against North Vietnam aimed at putting pressure on the enemy without causing their Chinese supporters to intervene that kind of strategy calls for very delicate action and very delicate judgment. And of course there's no guarantee that it will work.

Speaker 2:          00:34:07       The offensive part of Pericles plan was deliberately to do little harm for actions that were too aggressive might anger the enemy and harden his determination. The goal was to depress the enemy's spirit by showing that there was no way for them to win to destroy their will to fight just a little footnote here.

Speaker 6:          00:34:36       That's always a critical issue in any strategy that any body adopts in a war. Really a two fundamental goals. And they are not always. They do not always produce the same strategy. One is to make it impossible for the enemy to fight to destroy his capacity to fight. If you do that you have certain victory. The other is to destroy his will to fight. And of course if you do that you win but his will may not be responsive to your approach.

Speaker 7:          00:35:16       If they could destroy the Spartan will they could be expected to make an associated piece that would return to the status quo before the war only made more secure by the demonstration that it could not be overthrown by force. And that was Pericles his aim in the war that strategy failed as had Pericles. Diplomatic maneuvers in the period leading to war from four thirty three to four thirty one when civil war and epidemics. A remote town on the fringes of the Greek world threatened to bring a great war between the Peloponnesian league and the Athenian Empire. Perry clearly Pericles as I have argued to you pursued a policy of restrained limited intervention meant to deter Kahn's Spartans important ally without driving the Spartans and all their Peloponnesian allies into a war against Athens that effort also failed and resulted in a terrible war that Pericles had wanted to have to avoid.

Speaker 7:          00:36:27       Do these great strategic failures fully make the case for Pericles critics were they the result of cowardice lack of enterprise and resolution. I think that a fair examination of his performance throughout his life as general suggests otherwise. The charge of personal cowardice is ludicrous even fluke Hartung concedes that his personal courage operated in battle and in the assembly. No Athenian who led armies and navies in many battles repeatedly setting up trophies of victory could have escaped condemnation. Had he shown any sign of cowardice nor could he have been re-elected Gen. year after year. If that was the picture of him nor did he fail to demonstrate boldness and enterprise in 446 the very survival of Athens and her empire were threatened. The most menacing rebellions broke out close to home. You'll be a mega be OCA prickly swiftly took an army to put down the ruby in rebellion and justice swiftly withdrew on news of the second which opens the door to a Peloponnesian invasion of Attica.

Speaker 7:          00:37:48       He arrived. You remember too it just in time to persuade the Spartans to withdraw. And then he returned at once to UBS to suppress the rebellions there. And again when the island of Samos launched a dangerous rebellion back and forth 40 Pericles took personal charge acting promptly and decisively in catching the same year and rebels unprepared for his swift reaction. Taking them by surprise ultimately forcing them to surrender by means of a naval blockade. These expeditions however show that Pericles frequent caution. Did not derive chiefly from a temperamental tendency or a character flaw but from thought and calculation. The main reason he avoided land battles against their Spartan the Spartan and Peloponnesian allies is because he was certain to lose. The numbers were decisively against him. Yet he was more careful then were bolder generals no poets in the Greek world was prodigal with its citizens in battle. And it behooves the general especially in a democratic state to keep the casualty lists as low as possible. We need to remember that Athenian generals were not only military leaders but also politicians who needed to be re-elected to their posts every year no doubt Pericles sincerely took pride in the prudence and economy of his leadership but it could not have hurt his political popularity when he boasted to the Athenians.

Speaker 10:         00:39:37       What I've quoted before that as far as it was in his power they would live forever and be immortals. Such considerations help explain his cautious performance. And yet there is no evidence to suggest that he was one of those rare military geniuses who belong in the ranks of Hannibal. Caesar Alexander the Great a lesser but still worthy example in our own time George Patton who understand the limits of rational calculation in war and the need boldly to seize opportunity when it offers proclaims was what a term that was used in the second world war. A soldier's general as the PR forces of Omar Bradley attached that title to him.

Speaker 7:          00:40:30       He was no George Patton or perhaps even a Bernard Montgomery who seeks battle only when the odds are very heavily in his favor. He lacked the flair and the boldness of a claim on the daring and ruthlessness that seeks victory at any cost. Another element has been suggested to explain the prickly in strategy Pericles himself says one critic was rather an admiral than a general the Athenian Admiralty it was which framed the strategy at the outset of the war not Pericles the Borg Meister but proclaims the admiral invented the strategy of exhaustion a strategy which came near to ruining Athens in a couple of years and could never have won the victory. Well there was some merit in this analysis. The Athenians under Pericles had built a grand strategy that was based on naval power. That might seem to suit a maritime empire whose homeland was an island such as Great Britain's or a power that dominates a continent and is separated from other great powers by two great oceans like the United States Athens geographical situation was not so fortunate for the city was attached to the mainland offering targets of coercion not available to the enemies of the great Anglo-Saxon countries.

Speaker 7:          00:42:04       Paris please try to cancel that disadvantage by building the long walls connecting the city to its fortified harbour. Thereby in effect turning the city into an island. It was an extraordinary strategy far ahead of its time in its reliance on human reason and technology and its rejection of traditional ways of fighting that cost lives and gave the enemy an advantage. At the same time he abandoned all ideas of further expansion and devised a policy aimed at preserving peace and the status quo. That perfectly suited Athenian interests.

Speaker 4:          00:42:49       Such a policy dependent for success on an extraordinary extraordinary amount of rationality on everyone's part.

Speaker 11:         00:43:00       The Athenians must be content with what they have and abandon hopes for extension of their power.

Speaker 10:         00:43:08       There were always the Athenians who objected to that. But while he lived Pericles had the wisdom and the political strength to restrain and control them. What he could not control were the other states and especially the enemy. Unexpected changes and shifts in power are the normal condition of international history. These changes have always taken place because international relations are guided only partially and spasmodic early by rational calculations of material advantage. Always at work as well are greed ambition jealousy.

Speaker 12:         00:43:56       Resentment anger hatred and facilities famous triad fear honor and interest in the world as it has been.

Speaker 10:         00:44:09       Therefore a state satisfied with its situation and wishing to preserve peace cannot rely on a reasoned export it responds to its reason policies but must anticipate challenges that seem unreasonable. The Spartans and their allies ought to have recognized that they had no realistic strategy to promise victory over Pericles reliance on defense and refusal to fight a major land battle but resentment and anger at Athenian power and the fear that it might ultimately on their mind their own alliance and their security led them to fight. As I find it usual in human history they were more influenced by the memory of the Athenians failure to fight a traditional battle and negotiating a peace in forty forty six then by the recognition that the new technology in the form of the long walls made it unnecessary for Athens to risk such a battle in the future to deter a war in such circumstances which is what Pericles was trying to do requires some offensive threat to the pelican nations whose menace was great and impossible to underestimate that would make the fear of immediate consequences of war stronger than all the emotions leading to war. But Pericles had come to think of Athens as an invulnerable island.

Speaker 7:          00:45:52       Since the acquisition of a fleet of vast treasury to support it and defensible walls for such a state to adopt a defensive strategy is natural. It had developed a unique and enviable way of fighting that use these advantages and avoided much of the danger and unpleasantness of ordinary warfare and allow the Athenians to concentrate their forces quickly and attack islands and coastal enemies before they were prepared. And it permitted them to strike others without danger to their own city and population. Success. And this style of warfare made it seem the only one necessary and defeats with great losses on land made the Athenians reluctant to take risks by fighting on land offensive action in their views should be taken as a last resort only only when it was absolutely unavoidable. Pericles carried this approach to its logical conclusion by refusing to use a land army even in defense of the homeland much less by using it in offensive efforts that might do the enemy serious harm.

Speaker 7:          00:47:12       The enemy's passionate refusal to see reason made what might be called the Athenian way of warfare. Inadequate and Pericles strategy a form of wishful thinking that failed for a state like Athens in 431. Satisfied with the situation capable of keeping the enemy at bay the temptation to avoid the risks of offensive action is great. But as people often don't notice it contains great dangers it tends to create a rigid way of thinking that leads men to apply a previously successful strategy or one supported by a general theory to a situation in which it is not appropriate. But it may have other disadvantages as well its capacity to deter potential enemies from provoking a war is severely limited. Deterrence by standing behind a strong defensive position and thereby depriving the enemy of the chance of victory. A suit assumes a very high degree of rationality and some degree of imagination on the part of the enemy Spartans invaded attic and 430 1 They must have thought they were risking little even if the Athenians refused to fight even if they persisted in that refusal for a long time.

Speaker 7:          00:48:38       Both of which they thought was unlikely and unnatural. The Spartans would still be risking little more than time and effort. In any case their lands and city would be safe had the Athenians possessed the capacity to strike where the enemy was vulnerable and had that capacity been obvious to everybody. Pericles strategy of deterrence might have been effective once the war came. There was no way to win without abandoning the Athenian way of war and the parrot clan strategy as Pericles lay dying in the fall of 429. His strategy was a failure after three campaigning seasons the Peloponnesian showed no signs of exhaustion of any kind. On the contrary they had just lately refused an Athenian offer of peace and fought on with a determination to destroy Athenian power forever. The Athenians on the other hand had seen their lands and homes ravaged repeatedly their crops and trees burnt and destroyed.

Speaker 10:         00:49:49       They were also suffering from the plague which was killing great numbers of them and destroying their moral fiber in the anecdote that I be I quoted at the beginning of this talk. Plutarch speaks of Pericles response to the praise of his military prowess. You'll remember he expressed astonishment. You know they thought he was sleeping it turned out he wasn't he was hearing what they were saying. He expressed astonishment that they should be praising what was the result of good fortune as much as his own talents and what many others had accomplished. Instead he said they should be praising the finest and the most important of his claims to greatness that no Athenian now alive has put on mourning clothes because of me. That assertion. The last words of Pericles reported to us must have astounded his audience. Even his friends would have had to admit that his policy had contributed at least something to the coming of the war and that his strategy had something to do with the intensity of the destruction caused by the play.

Speaker 10:         00:51:08       His final words show deeply how he felt the wounds caused by the widespread accusations hurled against him and his stubborn refusal to admit. That he had been wrong in any way. He had applied his great intelligence to his city's needs and reason told him that he was not responsible for the results which he must have believed to be temporary. He must have thought in time his expectations would be fulfilled if his fellow citizens would have the wisdom and courage. To hold to his strategy they would win out. So he believed and so did his contemporary facilities more than two millennia later. Clausewitz saw war through very different eyes. I quote him. War. Is more than a true chameleon. That slightly shapes its characteristics to the given case as a total phenomenon. Its dominant tendencies always make war a paradoxical trinity composed of primordial violence hatred and enmity which are to be regarded as a blind natural force of the play of chance and probability within which the creative spirit is free to roam and its elements of subordination as an instrument of policy which makes it subject to reason alone these three tendencies are like three different codes of law.

Speaker 10:         00:52:55       Deep rooted in their subject and yet variable in their relationship to one another. A theory that ignores any one of them or seeks to fix an arbitrary relationship between them would conflict with reality to such an extent that for this reason alone it would be totally useless like most generals in history and unlike its few military geniuses Pericles saw war as essentially a linear phenomenon subject as Clausewitz said to reason alone and too little in my judgment.

Speaker 7:          00:53:38       Did he understand its other aspects. For that he and his people paid a very great price. OK. Well we do have some time and I'd be very glad to hear any questions or comments and any of you would like to make. After all we only have a twenty seven year war. We got 20 minutes to talk about it. No problem. Anybody have anything to say.

Speaker 13:         00:54:04       Yes. Why is.

Speaker 14:         00:54:07       This way writers of antiquity works to harness that power. Why was it in the.

Speaker 8:          00:54:13       That's a fairly long story but I think the best answer I can give is the one I gave yesterday last time when I spoke about Cincinnati's reasons for writing the story that he did. He had been a supporter of Pericles and things hadn't worked out well. The state had gone in a direction very different from the one that he favored including a strategy that was the opposite of Pericles. The average guy in the street who was a guy that he didn't approve of very much thought wrongly Heath. He believed that Pericles had been right had been dead wrong was Pericles fault they went to war was powerful his fault they lost the war and facilities associated himself I think with Pericles and his approach to things and so he had to make the case that he believed the case he made. I mean it's very important to realize that and Plutarch coming many centuries later like everybody who has ever spoken about the Peloponnesian War once their cities had written was powerfully influenced by three cities. I think just about everybody who's ever considered the war has come away pretty much with facilities judgment of these things.

Speaker 15:         00:55:26       So I think that's the answer to that somebody will handle. No I imagine the hand yes.

Speaker 9:          00:55:51       The question is can I think of any modern generals who did use Pericles approach as a model. I think the answer is not anybody. Well yeah. General McClellan in the civil war and it was a very analogous situation.

Speaker 8:          00:56:12       McClellan did not want to fight Lee's army. He wasn't all that crazy about the antislavery stuff anyway. But apart from that he didn't want to pay the price which was a tremendous price of fighting the Civil War. And so he wanted to avoid battle and pretty much Lincoln couldn't get him to fight.

Speaker 10:         00:56:32       So that was. That's one example now this the next the next thing I would offer you as something to chew on at least it because it's not identical it's only similar. I think the the strategy undertaken by the secretary of defense and the current administration in launching the attacks on Afghanistan and on Persia Persian Iraq. I got Greeks I got Greeks on my mind. I have to fight Persians. Iraq reflected an aspect of it. They would both for reasons I don't have to explain to you desperately eager to reduce casualties to a minimum. And they were desperately eager to. Choose a an an approach that would limit the time that the war lasted. Because of the political situation in the last decades in American history and they had an advantage technologically that seemed to make that possible.

Speaker 8:          00:57:51       America's fantastic advantage in firepower and the capacity to deliver the firepower at a distance with very little risk to the deliverers with the notion of doing tremendous harm when it got there. But you I don't know if any of you remember any of this. Some of you were too young to even think about it I guess. But originally remember what was that phrase that they had. What was that great strategy we were going to use by bombing the hell out of the Iraqis.

Speaker 9:          00:58:21       Shock and Awe. It was the same thing. Shock and all was meant to say Oh my God this is gonna happen to us we quit.

Speaker 8:          00:58:28       Was what they had in mind and they deliberately chose not to have ground forces that would have been capable of doing the kinds of things that it turns out you need to do to be successful in these wars just like other wars. So the end. And when it happened that it was clear things were not working out according to their plan. They stubbornly clung to that plan even as the evidence was that it wasn't going to work. So that would be a candidate I'd suggest. Yes.

Speaker 13:         00:59:05       Yeah.

Speaker 16:         00:59:11       A little bit louder please. A Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:59:28       The question is do I. Do I think that the recent Athenian history or the structure of the democratic society. Democracy had anything to do with the adoption of this plant. Perhaps. You're absolutely right. There must have been a very clear and painful memory of what happened to Thomas's when he invaded Bosnia. There were very very heavy casualties there for the Athenians. That's the only one in which they did have a. But they did have those and they were unusual so that it may have persuaded Pericles that the Athenian people would find it hard. But on balance I really think not. I don't think that the Athenian democracy was very different from the oligarchies of the other Greek cities in the way they thought about things they would have much preferred to fight it out. It was only Pericles incredible command of the political situation that allowed him to take the strategy that people had what the world is this guy doing.

Speaker 8:          01:00:28       And they turned against it very swiftly. So no I don't think that democracy was especially important now. The enemies of Pericles and the enemies of democracy I should say the enemy of Americans. I mean the ancient enemies of democracy do say that it was the Athenian democracies way of running the war which guaranteed disaster and they fixed on something that comes later down the road. The Sicilian expedition which was a dangerous undertaking as it turned out although these things didn't think so at the time and they think only a democracy could have done anything as stupid as that and they are in that way following precisely what lucidity says. But if you read my account you'll see that is another way of looking at it but that that's what the ancient anti-democratic view was. Democracies are idiots they don't know how to conduct war do anything else right. They will bring disaster. I think you can get disaster a lot of ways.

Speaker 17:         01:01:31       Julieta and yet we know that Turkey was only one of my generals. So my question was Is there any evidence that the yet.

Speaker 8:          01:01:47       No. It's very clear that so long as Pericles was in charge everybody did what Pericles wanted done. Part of the reason was that we know pretty well from the evidence that at least a good number of the 10 generals in any one year were. Close to Pericles so that his political influence spread. Very unusual thing in the ancient world for any body. In ancient Athens for anybody to have that kind of a carry over effect. But we see there's always several generals that we know are friends of Pericles and I think the rest of the story is that you see the generals don't get to decide what they do. In ancient Athens this is the part that blows your mind when you send an army out that Army gets a general or more it gets an assigned amount of money and equipment and stuff and it gets orders. And all of those things are decided by the Assembly after a debate by a majority vote. And what I would suggest to you is that Pericles did not lose any of those arguments except in the one case when they came after him and nail them and then they put him back in office again. So does that take care of your question.

Speaker 18:         01:03:03       That's a good yeah.

Speaker 19:         01:03:05       Heather you probably didn't want to have just gone.

Speaker 8:          01:03:24       Yeah. The question the heart of the question is why was apparently it wise to adopt a strategy no matter how good a strategy it might have been which he knew the Athenians didn't like. And I think the answer. Well in the end the outcome is obvious. No he wasn't wise but that's I think more because the strategy was faulty not so much because the Athenians didn't like it. He had proven over the years and he proved now in the most delicate of times that essentially he could get the Athenians to do what he wanted to do whether in fact they liked it to begin with or not. He persuaded them to do it. So I don't think that was really a flaw. The problem was that things went wrong almost immediately. And then such terrible things were happening as did shake his power for a while. But even then he came back into power and still the strategy wasn't working. I think the problem therefore I think you could say he knew what he was doing. He thought he could get away with it and he could have if the strategy had been correct.

Speaker 20:         01:04:36       You know to start with you. Uh uh uh. People from the different Oh yes.

Speaker 10:         01:04:57       Yes. The question is ancient writers Plutarch is whom you're really talking about.

Speaker 8:          01:05:04       They give Pericles credit for being a great general but they say bad things about Nicholas who was involved in the great defeat in Sicily. And yet Nicholas pursued something like the strategy of Pericles which was avoiding these conflicts. Well I think first thing I want to point out is that subsidies didn't do that. Not only this facilities so thoroughly support the strategy of Pericles he writes and in incoming him on the death of Nicholas that raises him to the level of Pericles or higher in his own estimation. But in the case of Nicholas it was in a way even worse than what Pericles did because Nicholas first of all was against the war against going to Sicily in the first place. Then when he was chosen to be general he went. But before he did that he tried to convince the having lost the vote shall we go.

Speaker 8:          01:06:12       He then decided to trick the Athenians into not going any way by saying to them oh well if you're going to go all right but it'll be perfectly safe if you just sort of take this. The original fleet was going to have 60 ships period. Well it ended up having 130 ships 5000 hop lights raising the risk of that thing to the level that finally made it seem like they could lose the war by losing the Sicilian campaign. And he didn't. The Athenians instead of saying which what he expected. Oh no no. If that's what we have to do let's not go. Instead they said Right on. Yes you can have everything you ask for Nick is what would you like. And off they went. And thereafter his performance on that expedition is one of somebody who doesn't really want to carry out his instructions.

Speaker 8:          01:07:07       He just what he would have liked to do was having lost the argument twice. Now he went out and did everything he could to avoid confronting any battle in Syracuse and was finally driven to fight at Syracuse very much against his will. And then I could you know go back and read it but he screws up the detail of it over and over again. And so I think there are good grounds for condemning him as a general whereas the grounds on which Pericles should be criticized I think is as a strategist rather than as a commander anybody else.

Speaker 21:         01:07:52       Yeah. No.

Speaker 22:         01:08:00       But I think they. Well I'll make one little exception to that but I I think they could have had a very good chance to come out of the war in the way Pericles hoped they would if they had pursued the limited aggressive program that was undertaken by Clinton in Damascus and these after the death of Pericles. So taking pilots building afforded pylons taking Cicero building a fourth there and perhaps even a few other places on the periphery of the Peloponnese and launching attacks from those places but not staying to fight the Spartans at any great battle just causing that to happen if they had been able to do that for a stretch of time then the hope that Clay on had that the headlights might escape to these forts and that then ultimately bring about an internal upheaval which the Spartans panic might happen would have led the Spartans to offer peace and in fact they do the Spartans off peace many many.

Speaker 22:         01:09:06       You could argue that if the Athenians had simply accepted the Spartan peace offer in for twenty five the war would have been over and the Athenian Empire would've been intact just the way Pericles wanted it. So not only could they have done it they would have done it if they'd accepted it. They wouldn't accept victory you could argue as many a scholar does. You have the only other point I want to make is after that didn't happen and finally a peace was drawn up and signed then in effect in 421 which is another evidence that they could achieve what they wanted by the techniques that were put forward. But after that happened that peace broke down and now the Athenians found themselves part of a new alliance of states Peloponnese as Athenians with three Peloponnesian democracies who produce a big land battle in the Peloponnese. And the Athenians come that I mean the enemies of Sparta come that close to defeating the Spartan army in the Peloponnesian War. Had they done that they would have finished Sparta off as a dominant power grid. So the answer is they they actually had it in their hands a couple of times and in another time they missed by about an inch. Yeah. They could've won that way. I think we're out of time. Let me wish you all a very happy holiday. Bye bye.
