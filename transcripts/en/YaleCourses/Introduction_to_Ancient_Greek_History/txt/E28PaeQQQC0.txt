Speaker 1:          00:00:01       My sister just died in 527 with all his power and so far as we know peacefully. And was succeeded in the tyranny over Athens by his sons by his first wife.

Speaker 2:          00:00:20       Hippies. Who was the elder and hip parkas. I think it's it's reasonable to think it's proper to think of hippies as the man in charge but hip Farkas shared a considerable amount of his power and responsibility. At first. It appears that they ruled in the same way that their father had which was to say one that was moderate and didn't cause a great deal of opposition. In Athens. And of course there always was a certain amount of opposition and we should not forget that aristocratic families always vying for their own power and their own position were uncomfortable very often under a price Judas and different ones. Different families got into trouble and were driven out and our old friends the alchemy on it I got into trouble again were banished. In the time of the sons of my sisters and it was necessary to fight to have a battle against them in which they were defeated and driven out.

Speaker 2:          00:01:31       I will play a significant role in the future of Athens quite soon but I think it's in the year 5 14 that a very important event changes the course of things. There is a personal quarrel between the tyrants one of the tyrants actually and one of the noble young men which results in a plot to kill both hippies and hip parkas led by two young men who will become known in feet in law as the tyrannosaur sides because in their plot they succeed in killing the younger brother hip pockets although they don't get hippy as they themselves are killed.

Speaker 3:          00:02:17       The plot fails but its significance I think comes in the fact that it made hippies thereafter very nervous very concerned about his safety and about the future of his regime and the nature of the regime according to tradition changes and it becomes very harsh and there are prosecutions of people who are suspected of perhaps plotting who are hoping to plot against the tyranny and that's significant and that's a characteristic event as I told you early on as I spoke about tyranny in general. Usually in the second and sometimes if they made it to the third there would be opposition. The opposition would make the rulers nervous the nervous rulers would then misbehave and create further opposition. And that's the story as it happens in Athens.

Speaker 4:          00:03:11       One wrinkle in the Athenian story is that the alchemy on a guy who had been expelled from the city always active always thinking became got into a position of especial favor to the Delphic oracle. When there was an earthquake that badly damaged the temple of Apollo at Delphi the alchemy on died bid for the contract to rebuild rebuild the temple and in the doing of that they spent some of their own money to make the temple even more beautiful than the contract required which put them in great favor with the priests of Delphi and they immediately cash this favor in in the form of seeking their own political advantage.

Speaker 3:          00:04:04       The story as Herodotus tells it is that their goal was to drive out happiness from Athens and the way to do it this time. Remember they've tried every trick in the world and it hasn't really work. And the idea now is to turn to the most powerful military state in Greece and use it for their purposes. I'm talking of course about Sparta and the tale is that whenever the Spartans sent a message to the Delphic oracle asking for an opportunity consult the oracle.

Speaker 5:          00:04:36       The answer that came back was first free the Athenians. Well whether that was the reason or he had reasons of his own the very ambitious King of Sparta King Clay hominids was going to undertake the job of removing hippies from power in Athens quite soon. It's in the year five eleven ten that the Spartans under clear nominees will invade Attica gain control of the state and remove hippies and withdraw. But we'll come back to that story in just a moment. Let me conclude our consideration of the Athenian tyranny by looking at what were the achievements and consequences of the years of tyrannical rule. Many positive elements as was so often the case with tyranny from the economic side. This was a period of great expansion of Athenian commerce trade very strong to the east through the hell respond and to the Black Sea but also in this period.

Speaker 5:          00:05:55       Athens trades very strongly with the West. I meant to say chiefly Sicily and Italy and in fact up to that point up to those years roughly speaking currency and pottery fine currency and pottery is dominant in the western areas is no surprise that's always been the case for a currency but by the end of the sixth century Athenian pottery has actually outstripped that in the Western markets which show you how much this combination of trade industry was changing the character of Athens and making it wealthier and bringing along various elements that of change in their way of life.

Speaker 2:          00:06:42       Another consequence of the tyrannical experience in Athens was a diminution in the power of the aristocracy.

Speaker 6:          00:06:51       And this again the general story wherever we see tyranny in the Greek world it never erases aristocracy you never see the disappearance of the distinction between nobles and commoners and claims to the aristocracy of birth and descent from the gods. It's always there. And even in the most democratic of Athenian of Greek states like Athens for instance it did an aristocracy doesn't go away. It's not abolished. It live side by side with a democratic constitution. But the DUP the domination by the aristocracy the monopoly of all the powers and influence that they used to have. It's not there and that is a tremendously important consequence so that when the tyranny goes away and it's necessary to reconstruct a New Athenian constitution the answer will not simply be a return to the old days before the tyrants so long had intervened in an important way. And the tyrants had made their contribution to to changes that turned out to be permanent. It's also true that under the tyrants the local power of the noblemen had been reduced and the power of the government in Athens which was not dominated by the aristocracy but by the tyrants that was a trend and one of the issues that would have to be worked out would be what would be the relationship between the localities outside of Athens and the city itself. Localism has been damaged but not abolished.

Speaker 7:          00:08:34       If there are going to be new forms of government that take place one of the consequences one of the things I should say when the precursors of that will be to further strengthen the centre and weaken the periphery and to continue to strip as best one could the influence and power of the aristocracy which was mainly to be felt in the countryside and to increase the power of some other form of government which centre would be in Athens. On the other hand because of the reforms of so long which I remind you by sisters and his sons allowed to stay in place at least in the formal sense because therefore every year. Think about it. People were elected Aachen people were chosen for a council. Law Courts operated all of these things not dominated by the aristocracy but really in the case of the magistracy as the wealth.

Speaker 8:          00:09:45       Was the criterion Remember ever since so long. So that people who were not aristocrats but were wealthy also participated in those jobs and the council which was open to three out of the four Athenian classes under so long meant that people actually went to the council chamber participated in decisions about what was going on to be sure they weren't going to do anything that the tyrants didn't want but nineteen ninety five percent of the time may be more tyrant didn't care so that they were getting.

Speaker 9:          00:10:17       This is the point I really want to stress. They were getting experience in the business of self-government. And when you do that I think the history of the world shows that once people have risen to that state where they do participate in their own self-government it's very hard to get them back into a state when they don't anymore. That's going to be very difficult to make stick. Athens has been moved down the road to self-government as a consequence. Strangely enough of the tyranny just in passing I might point out that's not a unique phenomenon. It's very interesting to look back at the early post colonial age in the 20th century and to see that there were real differences between colonies that had been ruled in. I would want to say tyrannical way but in an absolute way such as the Congo or other places like that as opposed to places that had achieved some degree of self-government even while they were ruled by a European power. The difference was very great. Once you have the same experience that I'm talking about now that led to the capacity and a determination to govern oneself was more likely in places where there had been some such thing.

Speaker 7:          00:11:44       India of course is a striking example where the Indians had managed to achieve some degree of participation in the government of their own state under the British who in spite of all the troubles they had have actually produced a functioning relatively democratic government in that great subcontinent. Well that's the sort of thing I'm talking about. So. Knowing what we now know looking backward is possible to say it looks like the tyranny played a very important role in the transition from aristocratic government to democracy. That's not what the tyrants intended they intended to rule for as long as they could. But it was one of the consequences as we will see.

Speaker 6:          00:12:31       Well let's turn once again to those me on a day who had as you remember a checkered past in Athens and even under the tyranny because they had been driven out. Remember mega Cleese had had his deal with my sister this had broken that position is that broken that deal so he went into opposition. He and the army and I had driven out but they came back because we find Christ in his name on the list of our cons but then they had been driven out again and in the year five eleven ten Kleist Denise who was leader of the alchemy and had family and political faction was in exile and was working to get the Spartans to do the job that was done so please Minnie's takes his Spartan army in and 510 he drives out the tyrants and then he goes home. Now the question that confronts the Athenians is what form of government should we have.

Speaker 6:          00:13:33       And again there's there's a whole range of possibilities not a whole range or a few possibilities that one would be reactionary. Let's go back to the days before so long when the aristocracy was everything. There certainly as we will see where people who wanted to do something very much like that. On the other hand what are you going to do about all these people of consequence who are wealthy and who have made it to the top of the were not aristocrats and then what are you going to do about all of these family farmers of whom there must be more now than ever because of the. My suggestion that by system this had taken away land from some exiled aristocrats and distributed among families some of whom were successful on farms and became hotplate soldiers and independent farmers they're not going to be enjoy being put back to a position which was worse than they had under the tyranny because under the tyranny they were sitting on councils and participating in these things and sitting in courts and now there's ever gonna be take all this was going to be taken away if the reactionary aristocracy had its way.

Speaker 6:          00:14:44       That was really what the contest was. I think it should. Should we continue with the colonial constitution only without tyrants or should we go back to an aristocracy and the contest for how to decide that was done in the usual old fashioned way. That is to say in the contest for the arcane ship the candidates on of holding one view ran against candidates holding the other view and that's where the matter would be sited be decided. But they went at it in the old way. That is the decisions were being made in the political clubs that belonged to the aristocracy. In other words how we're going to do this was being fought out. In the with among the aristocrats not among the public at large. And in that contest place the names who stood for the more moderate for the colonial let us say approach as his family had always done lost.

Speaker 6:          00:15:52       The winner was a man called ISAC Iris an aristocrat. They were all of us to crash of course and he engages the I should say by the way we're talking now. This court this election takes place after a preliminary pushing back and forth in the year 5 0 8 7 and his victory means a victory for the reactionary program and one of his first actions is to establish still another council not the Council of 400 that so long had established but a new council of 300 and it was to be made up only of aristocrats second. Very interesting and it turns out very important change introduced by ISAC which was to scrutinise the citizens list and then to remove from that list. Lots and lots of people who were deemed to be. I guess to say illegally enrolled in the citizen list. They were now going to impose retroactively the traditional criterion for Athenian citizenship is your father an Athenian citizen.

Speaker 6:          00:17:18       But we know that Solon had already broken through that by permitting people to come to Athens and to acquire citizenship if they had the necessary skills. And there surely had been a fair number of those. And we are told that the PI system heads had done the same thing for pretty much the same reason. So over a couple of generations you had foreigners coming to Athens and acquiring Athenian citizenship and undoubtedly using it who are now going to be disenfranchised and driven from the citizen lists. Now that made for quite a few discontented people in Athens if you if you picked a moment after which I sacrifice has accomplished these two things. That is establishing the Council of 300 which is obviously going to be the governing body in Athens and aristocratic council and driven X number of people from the citizen lists. Then all of those people are going to be very unhappy and very likely they have friends who are also going to be unhappy. So you have a situation which is by no means calm and subtle but it might have settled down as people as they usually do when things are unavoidable when there is no real option. Nobody is making a different case. They would have just gotten used to things I suppose but now Clyde Sinise decides to do things differently. He does not accept his defeat as he would have had to do in the old days having been defeated in the aristocratic contest instead in the words of Herodotus prose that reads it I tongue.

Speaker 7:          00:19:17       Damon He brought the people into his political faction the root of that first word processor reads a tie his head tie Rhea which means a club a political club a collection of companions. That's the name for these aristocratic societies and and Kleist and these broke the rules. He went out there beyond the aristocratic circle and he recruited people you'll become part of my political faction. Well why should they. Because he had a program that was contrary to the one pursued by high salaries. It's one that will result when it is successful in the establishment of what pretty much everybody agrees was the first Athenian democracy.

Speaker 6:          00:20:13       The reforms that he proposed then we have we have to imagine he actually went around an election year that was not done before that and persuaded people to support him in his programs and then he put his programs through. Well where did he put these programs through. He surely couldn't have done that in the Council of 300 it would never have passed any. I'm sure you didn't try. Instead he acted I think as though there was no council of 300. He did what you would have done if you wanted to propose a bill prior to that you would go you would go to the assembly which was the slowness in assembly and which had the right to pass laws no doubt. It only passed laws that the price district is wanted but it was not something new. It was something people were accustomed to. And he went to the Assembly and he proposed his laws and they were passed. Well I Sacker was still had the whip hand and he wasn't going to sit still while that took place. And so using the force at his disposal he drove clear. I'm sorry. It's matter of fact the force that I was at was at his disposal was that of tinkling nominees and the Spartans who came back again when called back. No doubt what Clemens had in mind when he did what he had done originally driving out the price district it was the establishment of an aristocratic republic in Athens with his friends being in charge.

Speaker 10:         00:21:46       That's what the Spartans typically would do if they could. So he was shocked and annoyed. I'm certain when he hears his friends have been somehow pushed out of power and some new fangled kind of a government that lets ordinary people participate has been instituted. So calamities comes back with his forces and drives Kleist and his and we are told this is interesting figure.

Speaker 7:          00:22:11       I can't promise that it's right but it does show up in Athens and Herodotus licenses and seven hundred families who must have been in his faction are driven out of Abbot out of out of Attica. But the people are not ready to take that.

Speaker 10:         00:22:33       They resist and they have numbers on their side and they end up shutting up clay hominids and his forces which are not many.

Speaker 6:          00:22:45       We're talking about probably hundreds of soldiers no more than that. And we must imagine that there are thousands of Athenians out there who are discontent. So they shut Clay nominees up on the Acropolis where he has run for safety with salaries at his side.

Speaker 7:          00:23:01       And finally they cut a deal and they go home and Kleist and his and his supporters who it's fair I think to start calling Democrats have taken over the city by this coup and are ready to go forward now this requires that they establish a new constitution because they're going to have a regime the likes of which no one had ever seen before.

Speaker 6:          00:23:32       But in trying to understand this constitution and it's not easy. The ancient sources tell us a lot about it but it's not perfectly clear what's in everybody's mind as they do what they do. Motives purposes are not clear as you'll see in a moment.

Speaker 9:          00:23:48       But anyway what I want you to a fix on is this. Don't imagine that what's taking place here is even anything like the American Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia where a bunch of delegates have been selected from here and there and they all sit and argue with each other over the hot summer and finally come up with various plans. It's better I think to think we're using historical analogies to help us as of course there is nothing better than that to help us. Think of the French Revolution. Think of the convention where the sort of the mass of the people have gained control of the situation after driving the king from his throne and after really putting aside a more aristocratic council that came before it and they sit down with radical people running around ready to kill people.

Speaker 7:          00:24:46       This is the outfit that's going to end up killing the King and his queen and all the aristocrats they can lay their hands on. In other words we are in a revolutionary situation and their force and terror. Are in the air and everybody is fully aware of the danger of this that and the other thing and of some dangers that probably don't even exist. We are in a situation that resembles civil war that could be on the brink of a serious civil war. And added to that. In other words the Athenians who are who will be sitting in the assembly passing the laws that produce the Constitution that Kleist in these favors are first of all already afraid that the local aristocrats will use force or guile against them. But on top of that there's been two Spartan invasions of Attica in the last couple of years and this is nothing to stop.

Speaker 10:         00:25:53       King Clay nominees from coming back again because he doesn't like the way he's been treated. In fact I'd go further I'd say there's every reason to fear that that's going to happen again. That's where the analogy to the French Revolution works again because nothing that happens in that the most radical period of the French Revolution is understandable if you don't know that the French regularly expect that the kings and emperors of Europe will be marching against them with professional armies very soon and their fear is absolutely justified and so is the Athenian fear that the Spartans will be coming.

Speaker 7:          00:26:30       So it's in that hot environment where fear is all over the place that this new democratic constitution will be shaped and there's no question that I think that the place where it's happening is in the Assembly. The Assembly sits as you I hope you know on a hillside in the middle of Athens on a hill called the panics and there in the open air all adult male citizens are eligible to participate in what takes place. One little point I also suggest to you is what about the people who have been thrown off the citizen lists. Are they there. My No. This is just reasoning I don't we don't have any hard evidence. My my my answer is absolutely they are. Who is going to tell them not to you show up on the Hill. Who's going to kick you off. This Kleist Dems want you kicked out. Hell no. Because as we will see one of his main planks is enrolling those people as citizens.

Speaker 10:         00:27:45       So in fact I will bet a lot of money that in all the electioneering that went on about all these different things they were a group he must have targeted and say you you've been unfairly treated by these aristocrats. If I get in power I will see to it that you are enrolled again as citizens. So all of that is happening and people are very excited about what is going on. That's the background for these rather dry and puzzling details I am about to lay on you to try to describe what this new what these new laws were that amounted to some kind of a democracy. At the center of them apparently were reforms of the tribes and they are in some ways very radical indeed. As you note these tribes go back. Before the birth of history. Think of any primitive society you want to it's likely to be divided up into tribes the tribes typically are alleged to come from some very ancient times when gods or heroes founded them.

Speaker 10:         00:28:51       That's certainly true of the Greek tribes where each tribe is named after some heroic figure or some semi divine figure in the past. So there are for the four traditional Ionian tribes and that's why this what makes it even more radical than anything else is that class in these law. Changes the tribal system in Athens from four tribes to ten tribes absolutely brand new things that have no tradition behind them nothing. No history or anything and then he has to give names to these tribes and according to the Greek practice these tribes have to have some founding hero to be named after so he gets picks out. I think I'm right in thinking 100 names of heroes and he assigns them to the ten tribes by lot and now we suddenly have ten new tribes now. I mean if you trick and try to think yourself back. To tribal society and think What a what a disruptive thing this is all my life I've been a member of the tribe named after iron. And some of my ancestors and so my answer no more. He's not around anymore. There's a new tribe that was just invented that I'm a member of. So that's a very surprising thing but that's not the end of the story.

Speaker 7:          00:30:17       Each tribe now is divided up into three parts. They the word for a third is treatise and the plural is treatise. And here's the point. Each one of each tribe has one of its treaty ace in and around the city of Athens.

Speaker 11:         00:30:44       It has another one in the middle of Athens. And I'm sorry in the middle of Attica and in the third it is the third of its three regions sorry of its of its three divisions will be in the region called the coast that Kerala.

Speaker 7:          00:31:08       So every tribe is geographically distributed across all of Africa in this way. That is something quite new in the old days. We have to believe that the tribes were geographically separated for regions for tribes.

Speaker 6:          00:31:31       Yeah. The Sydney region the Coast region and the Midland Region.

Speaker 7:          00:31:37       Each one of these regions has 10 treaties one for each of the 10 tribes. Now let's take it a step further. The treaties themselves are formed of units that are called deems in English. That's DTM yes the Greek word for it. Very confusing is de MOS now the day MOS is this deemed this political unit. It also means a village. It also means the whole Athenian people. And it also means only the poor Athenian people. So there you are. But in the context that we're dealing with it here we mean these units that are geographical and have a constitutional function. There is however even here there's a certain amount of.

Speaker 5:          00:32:34       Confusion because some of the deems are actually made up of an original village. They don't mess with that. Diem is the equivalent of. In other words a Diem is a dean the two different meanings of the word. The other deems for the constitutional purpose are made up of a number of villages. So there would be a lot of these old deans placed into the new constitutional deal. The idea however is that every treatise must be of the same size in terms of population because they have your whole idea is to get each tribe to be numerically equal and that's one reason for that is because the tribes will be the regiments of the Athenian army. You line up and fight in. When that when you're call to fight in the Army in your accordance with your Diem which is located in a certain tradition which is becomes a regiment of your tribe as a regiment of the army now.

Speaker 7:          00:33:40       They get to straighten out the deems are unequal in population but the trivia Ace has to be equal. So that tells you you have to have multiple teams in some and just one or two or not or a few in another.

Speaker 12:         00:33:56       All right.

Speaker 11:         00:34:06       It is also true that the treaties are assigned to the tribes by lot. And the thing I want you to remember I want to avoid as much complication as I can is that it doesn't really matter to the people who invented the Constitution how the Diems are assigned to the treaties except one scholar has suggested one motive that strikes most of us as very plausible made a careful study of how the themes are distributed to the treaties and compared them with where we know there were important religious sites. You know the Greek religion has these many gods and deities and they have local characteristics because there are legends about their having lit on this earth at a certain place or done a deed at another place. So you have a cave of hand in eastern Attica and you have a place where Athena did this that and the other thing.

Speaker 11:         00:35:16       And the point I'm getting at is these became shrines places where the religion was exercised and in ancient Attica aristocratic Attica the aristocrats owned a piece of land on which the shrine was which meant you had to have their permission to come onto it to worship which meant that they would have predominance power and influence in these areas. Well what does scholar David Lewis was his name. Concluded was that there are times when there are quite a few times when the thing is laid out in such a way as to decide the divide. The religious site on the aristocrats. Land. From his main dwelling on that land. So the aristocrat is separated from the place where he has religious clout as a way of dividing up his political influence and power. He reads this as a one of the ways in which class Sunnis attempted to diminish the power of the aristocracy through its local influence.

Speaker 7:          00:36:30       Now this new deem is very very important. It is the basic unit in the whole system it takes. It was meant I should say to take the place of the frat tree. You remember the Brotherhood that was the kernel of the old tribal system. It was meant that the frat tree that the Dean should be the basic thing for instance one of the most important things was that your citizenship according to the laws of class and these were no longer was no longer to be ascertained by going to your frat tree. But each Dean would keep an official role of the citizens in that deed. So when an Athenian boy is born and when he reaches a certain age you have to take him to the Diem and register him and now he can be an Athenian citizen. Well this was one of several things that we see in Christ in his constitution that.

Speaker 7:          00:37:35       In which the intention could not be carried out. That is the flattery and the notion of the flattery as the core of such things was never abolished would have been out out out of the question to abolish it that too many religious associations and it never really lost its place in the Athenian mind. Yes your official enrollment as a citizen was in the dream but there was still a tremendous allegiance to the flattery. So it didn't have its end and the factory was still run by aristocrats so it didn't have its full effect the Diem elected an official called a D Mark. We could might call a mayor or whatever the local official is called selectmen. We say sometimes still in Connecticut holding to our colonial traditions. And the demon is also given religious functions and religious rights because everybody knows that religion still is potent. Even if you're engaged in a revolution in Athens at the beginning of the fifth century here's another thing that they tried to do.

Speaker 13:         00:38:54       Kaizen is tried with a law to change the way in which an Athenian was officially designated. It used to be before classes came along. You ask a man who are you. He would say I am Kleist and he's the son of mega Cleese period. Just the petro Nemec just like you know you have you bear the name of your father unless you chose to bear the name of your mother which is evidence of how on the theman we really are.

Speaker 7:          00:39:31       So that's the way it was. But under the laws of Christ and His henceforth citizens were to be designated not as Christ in the son of mega Cleaves but as Kleist Denise from Alo picky which is to say his Diem he was to be the citizen's name and his Diem name it was a direct people have argued about what the point of all this was but I think one limited point before we get to the full story is simply another way of cutting down the influence of birth in this society as a way of damaging the aristocratic principle and asserting in its place look what's really happening here that there is something which is the poles that has nothing to do with birth that is the part of the legal structure which is a pole is it's a whole new concept that's really creeping in here replacing the old traditional way of organizing society with one that is the work of citizens coming together and determining how they themselves will be governed.

Speaker 14:         00:40:47       All right let that be the story of the tribes for a moment now. Here we go with another council. You've heard about the Council of 400. You've heard about the Council of 300. We can do better than that. We can have a council of five hundred.

Speaker 7:          00:41:05       It will be the council that is the Democratic Council for the remainder of the history of the Athenian democracy with the exception of short periods of oligarchic rebellion that remove it but it comes back when the democracy does and that council let me simply describe it very briefly. It is open to all Athenian adult male citizens. Membership on the council comes through some combination of allotment and election. The point that the point of it is that an assembly of thousands is not well-equipped to conduct all kinds of business that has to be conducted for the state and even its own business. You need a small group to prepare the agenda for a full assembly meeting and so that was the function of the 500. It is and this is very important one of those very democratic elements in the assembly of course is totally democratic because all adult male citizens participate if they wish. But you can easily get around that in some degree if you have a counselor little group that actually determines what's going to happen from the first. It wasn't so the the members of the council had to be I'm sorry the council itself was as democratic as the assembly and so we'll come back to that council later on but there it is in place.

Speaker 6:          00:42:56       Another thing that happened not in 5 0 8 7 but a few years down the road but still in this same period was that by now the army of Athens which originally had been led simply by the Parliament. The icon who was chosen for the military leadership he had given way to generals who commanded the different tribes.

Speaker 7:          00:43:20       And it used to be that each tribe elected its own general. But in the new system now each tribe sorry back up. The entire people elected the generals for each of the tribes. In other words the ten tribes still had a general apiece but the entire population elected him usually play. He came from the tribe that he was asked to command but not always. And again this you can see what the point of this is. It has the same characteristic as so much of what we are describing it is going to reduce this particular schism localism and make the whole people the whole demos and their representative institutions be the decisive element in the state and that is one of the things as well we'll be getting to right next to ask ourselves what's going on here and why is it happening.

Speaker 7:          00:44:21       And here's where our sources. I'll tell you what our sources say and that's the end of the day we have to make some judgments of course. Generally and I think properly the source get who gets the most credence from scholars today is Herodotus who's closer to it in time than although he's buying. You know I should point out here right if this is writing his history some time or at least he's writing it as late as the four twenties but he himself goes back to an earlier part of the 5th century and therefore he is in a position to hear stories from people who go back even into the 6th century which makes him theoretically a more credible source than people like Aristotle who I'll be quoting at you who lives in the 4th century and has a good hold century later than Herodotus. But Herodotus is not of course himself a witness to any of the facts that he abuses anyway he asks Why did Clay cities of Athens do what he did. And his answer is a pretty stale one. He was trying to copy his ancestor Kleist the knees of sticking on who also changed the tribes. You may remember in second from the old Dorian tribes two new tribes that designated the wrong people like I mean to say the Dorian's as swine men and asked men and so on.

Speaker 7:          00:45:56       And that that's why closely is that any sort of be a nice thing to do because his ancestors namesake did the same thing. Well I don't think we can buy that. We move into a more persuasive territory. I think when we get to Aristotle who writes in his politics as follows perhaps a question rather arises.

Speaker 11:         00:46:17       He's dealing with the whole question of citizenship about those who had been admitted to citizenship after a revolution had taken place for instance such a creation of citizens as that carried out at Athens by Kleist Denise after the expulsion of the tyrants when he enrolled in his tribes many resident aliens medics who had been foreigners and slaves. So here's a new story we have to add to the picture. I mentioned it in passing but it's very important. One of the things class this does and he has to do it through measures passed through the assembly is to enfranchise the people who had been thrown off the citizen lists.

Speaker 11:         00:47:07       And one thing that you want to do. You couldn't have done that given the nature of the old constitution if you hadn't broken up the old system of tribes fruit trees and so on and come up with a new one which would not have the old prejudices against it. So that's part of the story. Again Aristotle or one of his pupils there's some dispute about the document that is called Athenian pull a tail. Constitution of Athens as to whether Aristotle was the composer of that piece or one of his students. Anyway here's what it says. What the aim of mixing up the population so that a great number would share in the citizenship they came up with this phrase may follow Cree name do not judge according to tribe.

Speaker 14:         00:48:07       But it goes beyond tribe it merely means do not judge on the basis of birth. Aristotle says it was directed against those who wanted to check on family backgrounds.

Speaker 7:          00:48:23       He goes on to say this new nomenclature that's what I just mentioned to you before about your name is now no longer the son of you. You are the son of a so and so but rather you are of the Dean. So and so he says so that they would not by addressing one another by their fathers names expose the newly enrolled citizens but would call them by the families of the D. This passage caused a great deal of puzzle and confusion among scholars who couldn't understand what this is all about. And that's I think because the topic was mostly treated by by the British but Americans can see this right away. If you were the best way to put it this way of course you wouldn't know about this. You live in a country with absolutely pure and without prejudice according to race or color or ethnic origins or religion. So you won't know what I'm talking about but let me pass on from an earlier generation a darker time in which I grew up in which.

Speaker 13:         00:49:27       Supposing you were a man who came from the RNC in Italy and your name was Giovanni DiStefano that was fighting in the Abruzzo but in America there were people who didn't have a high opinion of people with such a name and were likely not to be opening their doors or homes to people like that. And so your son instead of calling himself.

Speaker 15:         00:49:59       Giovanni DiStefano changed his name to John Stevens and thereupon everything was OK.

Speaker 16:         00:50:09       That's the way things were meant to be in Athens.

Speaker 6:          00:50:13       That is to say the idea was if you had a foreign sounding name your father would have a foreign sounding name.

Speaker 9:          00:50:20       If he came from a foreign place when he settled in Attica you would be branded in that way. And people who wanted and here it was more specific who people who at some time I want to throw you off the citizenships lists would know who you were. But if you took a good solid Anglo Athenian name why you'd be all right.

Speaker 11:         00:50:39       So I think that is the explanation and it's all part of the same picture taking away the traditional influences that would be an anti-democratic and replacing them with things that shatter that and taking away the local powers. Anything that smacked of the past. You try to a race as best you can.

Speaker 7:          00:51:07       The procedure. We all agree is by the device that the Greeks called Safe is mine. It was a motion passed by the Assembly and it comes to be the standard form of legislation in the Athenian democracy. The plural of safe is my is safest my top. Now the scholar who I was alluding to a few moments ago. LEWIS He's got the general picture right. He says we have to understand all of this was passed on the assembly and a mood of great excitement and fear and anger. A revolutionary situation in which he imagined alluding to the revolution in St. Petersburg in 1917 that they are getting up and shouting all power to the ten tribes. To those of you who are not in St. Petersburg but they were shouting was all power to the Soviets. But I think he's wrong. It wasn't about the ten tribes the ten tribes weren't the issue. I think if they were shouting and I guess they were they were shouting all power to the clay C.R. to the assembly that's where decisions were going to be made in the future. But I do want you to take seriously the notion of the making such a claim and doing so in heated circumstances that are revolutionary because without that it's inconceivable that what happened would have happened. Now let me go back to the bullet.

Speaker 7:          00:52:50       It was elected by lot from proportional representation in the deans all of the unions. Greek word for preparing legislation for an assembly is pro Boone loosest and such a group is called Pro Bowl Lutnick. That is it prepares legislation the chances are that this council was more powerful and had more independence when it was invented than it would later on. That's just a guess. But you know you at the beginning of something there's still you're still living in a society in which class distinctions are very clear and very sharp in which the idea of the ordinary citizen taking things into his own hands is new and scary. I think that would have been a lot of deference paid to the individuals who came from the higher classes and I would guess that they would have been on the list preliminary list that that was elected before allotment selected among them.

Speaker 7:          00:53:57       And that when they proposed something to the assembly it would be given greater sort of greater influence on what happened subsequently than would be true when we get down to the full scale Athenian democracy in the time of Pericles. Forget about it. The bully is the servant of the assembly. Without question the assembly can if if the if the council sends in a proposed law and certain language the assembly can vote it down or they can send it back to the bully and say no we don't like those words change the words into this direction and send it back to us. That's the way it was in the full democracy. My guess is it wasn't that way in the year five or five.

Speaker 15:         00:54:43       I think it probably was meant by Kleist and these to be a bit more conservative without being of course in any way reactionary.

Speaker 7:          00:54:58       Now what is this all about in the largest sense Lewis suggests that there's something here that is personal and political and I think he's right. One of the elements that he suggests is these dreams were not assigned to treaties accidentally as I've suggested already but were carefully laid out not only to deprive noblemen of their undue influence but he thinks probably to help close the knees and his alchemy on the die to have a powerful voice and as much of Attica as he possibly could. Why in the world would anybody doubt that. That strikes me as being so I mean that's what people do when they have the power to help themselves politically they do. I would guess in other words Kleist in was thinking of his own political position in part. We don't have hard evidence for this but just a reasonable suggestion. Now the other thing is we have to we have to I think believe that the this whole program of reform was supported by what we have been referring to all along the hop like class.

Speaker 7:          00:56:18       These independent farmers they are the ones who are most numerous. They are. I mean among those who will be politically active also they are of course the defense of Athens. Now they have to be taken very seriously and they are not about to allow themselves to be cut out. Or to have their own influence diminished by things that are hanging over from the days of aristocracy. And so I think we should think of this most scholars. I think just about everybody does this. They like to designate this place authentic democracy. This first democracy as a hop light democracy and saying that the hot lights are in means that to some considerable degree the poor are out. The chances are very great. I would say pretty certain that. The majority of citizens. I'm sorry. Yeah. Majority of Athenian citizens were not hotlines.

Speaker 13:         00:57:27       They were thieves it probably never was a time when the hot lights were a majority even in Athens so excluding them certainly is a limit on what you want to call democracy. And here's where we get into sort of the debates these days. Many many the scholar now that the. The academy is essentially a branch of the Politburo will want to denigrate ancient Athenian democracy and to suggest it really wasn't democratic. Well 20 million ways you can do that.

Speaker 15:         00:58:08       You can talk about the fact that it excluded women you can talk about the fact that it who else is it excluded slate.

Speaker 17:         00:58:17       That it had slaves excluded slaves it excluded resident aliens. And all those things and then you can finally point to the fact that probably the majority of the adult male citizens were excluded from some important elements in the democracy although as time passes that last disappears and you have pretty much complete participation by the poor. But in Kleist in his case that's not so.

Speaker 13:         00:58:43       But I think that's to be deliberately blind to what's really happening. What you have is a miracle nothing in the world that we know of anywhere. Everything like this has ever been seen before. The reaction of the other Greeks as best we can figure out was horror. This is wild and crazy the stuff that the Athenians are doing. It is radical it is dangerous. We must contain ourselves and avoid being in touch with them. But what we should try to finish those guys off. Certainly that was the attitude the Spartans typically had towards it and undoubtedly the normal Greek government which was in an oligarchy. Certainly took the same point of view. So I think you can look at it from either direction probably should look at him from both. But don't miss the point that what's happening here is of this very special character. What did they call this constitution. Well we don't know yet but the chances are great that they did not call it democracy. The word democracy our democracy comes from the Greek democratic. Which I guess you would want to translate is something like power. For. The masses for the people at large for the people as a whole. But it was a name that was given to the Athenian constitution by people who didn't like it. Why did they think of themselves.

Speaker 7:          01:00:11       Well Robert this refers to this regime as one of these so no media equality of law. Oh and I think the thing that's most important about is equality before the law. That is something that wipes out distinctions among classes of people on the basis that it when it comes to the law. Every man who comes before the law is equal to every other man. Well that's a very big change that no place else in the world had. And I think that's not a bad way to think of it. And one of the principles that belong from the first to this democracy and was maybe as crucial as anything in characterizing it was what they called you say go read equality but equality of speech really meant equality of the opportunity to address the political body meaning the assembly. Every Athenian male from the first adult who was regardless of what his money rating was of his class whether he was feet or higher.

Speaker 7:          01:01:32       Everyone had the right to speak in the assembly. Now this had been a right that was limited of course to aristocrats in many cities or to the wealthy in other cities. But we know from the some of the poems in the fifth and the sixth century it was prized as the evidence that an individual was a free man as opposed to a slave. He could get up in the center. That was the term they use of the town meaning where the meeting place was and then speak his mind and also try to persuade his fellow citizens to do as he thought best. We should not take this lightly in our world where we never imagined ourselves in such a situation. It's hard to grasp but actually to think if I want to I can get out there during the debate that's going to decide what happens and I can say what I have to say.

Speaker 15:         01:02:32       So freedom of speech very very central to to the Athenian idea of self-government.

Speaker 7:          01:02:45       The role of the ballet in place of aristocratic councils enhances the democracy there. On the other hand things did not happen that you might think what happened. Nothing was done in the sphere of the economy.

Speaker 17:         01:03:05       There was no change in slowness in classes or privileges. You still had to have a certain amount of money to be elected to the top things in the state. The area of business was left untouched. Remaining a collection of former magistrates all of whom had been aristocrats the factories the home of aristocracy were left intact you had this hot light democracy which was indeed democracy but we must imagine. I think all the evidence would support this imagination that. It was a deferential democracy in which the lower classes still looked up to the upper classes for leadership and guidance and they themselves did not hold leading positions in the state. I think that's the picture we have. Well let me try it last to one of the most to melt to my mind one of the most interesting features of the Constitution introduced by Kleist and this gives us a picture of how things worked that we wouldn't get any of any other way. I'm talking about the law that was passed.

Speaker 13:         01:04:19       On ostracism. Our word ostracism derives from it but it's something quite different. If you somebody says we're going to ostracize this guy today it means we're not going to invite him for a drink. We're not going to go to his parties things like that. Now this was something far different and was a central part of the political system.

Speaker 15:         01:04:40       Let me begin by simply describing how it worked.

Speaker 17:         01:04:44       Every year let us say in the month of January that's the way the Italian calendar would have made it come out more or less. Typically a vote automatically came up a question came up in the assembly automatically. Nobody had to move it. It was an automatic thing. Question was shall we have an ostracism this year. Now they could debate that question. But what they were not debating was who should we ostracize. That was not an issue. The only prints question was Should we have one this year. And if a majority said yes. Then they would go on. If the majority said no that was it no ostracism that year. But supposing a majority had voted for an ostracism. Now we go to roughly the month of March and let's go down to the centre of town the Agora which is the marketplace which is the political centre which is where people go to talk and all those things. That's where the action is. And for that day in that day alone. The Agora is fenced off and there are 10 gates in the fences one for each tribe.

Speaker 7:          01:05:52       And every citizen who wishes goes with a piece of broken pottery. Someone has described it as the scrap paper of antiquity. And with whatever you could get a piece of glass crayon or whatever you would simply write the name of a man that you would like to see ostracized. That year you would go to the gate. There would be some but people at the gate who would would identify you really as citizen where you come in. You handed in your Astrakhan and you went inside the eagle rock where you stayed until the voting was over so that you couldn't come back and vote again. They were cleverer than the people of Florida are today. So now it's over. The time has come.

Speaker 18:         01:06:51       And what they do is they divide up all the obstacles that have been cast and they don't divide them up. I'm sorry they put them in a big pile and counting. If there are fewer than 6000 ballots nobody gets ostracized if there are six thousand or more. Now they divide them up into piles and the one who gets the most votes not majority.

Speaker 15:         01:07:18       Just the highest number of votes plurality he wins he gets ostracized.

Speaker 13:         01:07:27       What does that mean. It means that he must leave Attica for at a certain distance from Attica to for 10 years. That's all he has been accused of no crime. Therefore he has been convicted of no crime. Nothing is done to his property. Nothing is done to his family. At the end of 10 years he may come back. And it's as though he never left.

Speaker 18:         01:07:58       The next day if he wants to we can run for public office that's all that is ostracism. What's this all about. What are the purposes of this thing. Well I think the best way to come at this is to tell you a couple of stories and some facts. The story I guess comes from Plutarch life of Arab Studies who is one of the leading Athenian figures at the early part of the fifth century and who in fact.

Speaker 13:         01:08:32       Was a man who was ultimately ostracized. The story goes like this. It's ostracism day in Athens and some country bumpkin some rube comes walking up and he spots outside is chatting with some folks and he goes up to reciting says Excuse me sir. I don't know how to write would you please write a name on this shirt for me. I recite is of course a gentleman. He says suddenly Sir what name would you like. He said the Arab state is please oh he says write down every.

Speaker 18:         01:09:07       And by the way said What is it that you have against Arab state. I should have told you that Arab Studies had earned the sobriquet the just Arab state is that just so the guy says Well what have you got against them.

Speaker 19:         01:09:25       I have nothing against the. I've never seen the man don't know I'm just so damn tired of hearing him called the just.

Speaker 13:         01:09:34       The point of that story is to illustrate Plutarch point is that the system of ostracism was just a piece of silly foolishness that you would associate with democracy which just allowed the jealousy of the ordinary man for superior people to determine what's going on. That's the message that Plutarch gets from that tale. Here's another piece of information that's not a tale. I think it's about 1937 38 an American archaeologist was working up on on the north slope of the Acropolis and he came upon a well he dug into the well and out came one hundred and ninety one inscribed punctures Astrakhan but one name written on all of them and that name was Mr. Cleese who we know was a participant in a batch of Astrakhan and the for a ostracism and for a and careful analysis of the handwriting indicated that these one hundred and ninety one Austria were inscribed by 14 hands writing them begins to sound familiar.

Speaker 7:          01:10:49       You guys I suppose is the best guess of everybody who studies these things is that we do not have here the remains of a collection of voters who voted and had their votes counted and then these came but rather that these were votes that never were cast actually so what's going on here.

Speaker 13:         01:11:11       Now I turned from my attempt at a factual account of what happened in the past to fiction. The rest of this is my imagination. And we find ourselves down the middle of Athens the day before the ostracism. We are in the home of John Potter. Who is a charter member of the Arab state his political club and what they are doing is sitting about chatting as they in size or paint the name on to a Astrakhan. The name is to mystically next day down there outside the agora. Various country bumpkins and others wandering into town and you step up to one of them and say perhaps you would like to vote in the ostracism today sir. I can save you the trouble of inscribe in your ballot. Here's one right now. I think this is pretty good evidence that we're talking about organized political activities which in fact I think totally squares with what we know about the purpose of ostracism. I should tell you one other thing that Cincinnati's himself says something very important about this. He says ostracism was brought about because of the fear and the insecurity that the Athenians felt about their democracy that it was in constant danger and that they needed something to help them.

Speaker 17:         01:12:46       That's the context in which he views it Plutarch as I say has a more general story the envy and jealousy natural to democracy. You must have realized that hardly anybody whoever wrote anything in antiquity had a kind word to say for democracy. It is a it's a bad thing from the standpoint of most of the authors of antiquity but the facilities was there while ostracism was a reality as opposed to Plutarch and I'm sure he is right. Let's look.

Speaker 7:          01:13:20       First of all at the moment when ostracism was invented in the time of Kleist Denise. And before we move beyond that what's the situation. Close the knees and company have just brought about this unique amazing end to the rest of the world. Dangerous cold data an invented this new wild crazy kind of government they know. That the Spartans are furious and they expect they're going to come down anytime. They also know that in Athens there are people who don't like this new government. Some of them are the heirs to the old aristocracy. Some of them are aristocrats themselves.

Speaker 16:         01:14:07       Others were very happy in the days of the tyranny. In fact there are still relatives of the tyrants eminent ones who are still in Athens. In other words they have to fear betrayal.

Speaker 13:         01:14:24       They have to fear internal hostility they have to fear people might start a civil war. At the same time as they have to be afraid of the Spartans coming up the road and we know because in a few years this is going to happen. They have enemies of other neighboring states Corinthians directorates. Others will be oceans thieves and within the next five years they will have. Invasions by those people as well. That's their situation. What are they afraid of. They are afraid that there will be treason inside the city which will help invaders or simply turn the city over to them. Well then why don't they just lock these guys up. Well the first place they probably haven't done anything yet. And you couldn't make a case against them.

Speaker 19:         01:15:15       On top of which you really don't if you're clean Sunnis you don't want to treat all of these people as though they are the enemies of the new regime. They are in fact natural opponents. That's the Friends of the tyrants and the old aristocrats. They're on opposite sides of the argument. Why would you want to put them together by assaulting their leaders. A smarter thing would be to try to win over.

Speaker 13:         01:15:43       One faction to support of your side at the expense of the other. And that is my guess as to what is another explanation of what's happening here. So here's another piece of fiction I want to throw at you. I imagine that Kleist in these stops by at the house of his parkas the son of Khamis who is a distant relative of the pious districts and who would be looked to as the leading figure in that faction and. He stopped by the sea. Park and Hyde Park this is a low class and they say What is this routine. What is this crazy new law that you and your boys just put through this ostracism law.

Speaker 20:         01:16:27       I hear in the streets that it's aimed at me as the leader of the old terrorist faction.

Speaker 16:         01:16:35       What is that in these I imagine would say. Now where did you get a crazy idea like that. I mean that's you're a swell fellow. I'm only against these terrible risk those out there in this Spartan lackeys that we're going to take away all the people's rights and I know you wouldn't want that to happen would be good. That's not like you.

Speaker 1:          01:16:53       So of course I can see your point. I can see you are alarmed. I can see that people might say gee those old hype the past history these people might be trying to overthrow this new democracy and bring themselves back in.

Speaker 20:         01:17:10       I know hippie is over there in Persia supported by the king and maybe people would thank you for bringing him back as a tyrant.

Speaker 1:          01:17:18       I know that would never be in your mind. But I tell you what you ought to do. Why don't you come over to my side and I'll see to it.

Speaker 13:         01:17:26       You know I have friends I got a lot of friends I could do you a favor you do me a favor I could do you a favor I could see that I would just kill that rumor and everything would be very happy next day all as well. And I think there's considerable evidence I don't have time for it now.

Speaker 1:          01:17:45       Not not certain but evidence suggesting that Marcus came on board and became part of a coalition that ruled Athens for decades after that time. And so that year there was no ostracism because they didn't have to be in ostracism. I think that is very important. Most years there was no ostracism only once in a while. And every single person that we hear ostracized was a leading political figure ostracism ensure it was meant to be a constitutional device to work in the political realm as a way of deterring a coup de Tau treason or other forms of unrest. You could only use it as a politician if you were the popular favorite if you were confident that the ostracism would go your way if you held in ostracism and that wasn't true. You might find yourself traveling a long way from home pretty soon. And so that's the essence of ostracism. And we'll have a look at it again because it crops up and is used but not for 20 years after it's invented. OK.
