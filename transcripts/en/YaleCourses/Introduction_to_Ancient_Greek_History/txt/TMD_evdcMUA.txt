Speaker 1:          00:00:01       The Persians were busy with other things as well as thinking about returning to Greece because the great king was not willing and understandably in a way to accept his defeat by these few puny Greeks because of the consequences that would have for the reputation of Persia. And just as a matter of personal honor these kings would not have been glad to accept such an outcome. I won't drag you through the details of the invasion by the Persians and for eighty. After all of making you read Herodotus and the whole problem about it. But let me simply talk a bit about the conclusion to the great invasions of the great Persian Wars as we call them and also to say something about what their meaning was the meaning of the defeat of the Persians and 479 was broader than the meaning of their defeat at Marathon in 490.

Speaker 1:          00:01:13       For one thing it involved the entire Greek nation. Of course it wasn't the nation. But you know I'm using the word loosely of course it didn't involve the whole of that nation no matter how loosely I use it because if you imagine that there are over a thousand plays there were only thirty one who signed up to resist the Persian invasion and for eighty however they included the most important and strongest and largest of the Greek poles. So it's not too much of a stretch to speak a bit speak of it as a Greek victory. And again the same issue that had been present at Marathon the question of whether the Greeks would continue to live their lives free in their place developing their own style their unique style of life or become another province of the realm of the Persian Empire just like so many others.

Speaker 2:          00:02:17       And we can see that in one wonderful contemporary reference to the meaning of the war it's in Aeschylus his first oldest surviving play Persians in which the central event is the great sea battle at Salomon house in which the Greeks defeat the Persian fleet which guarantees that the Persians will not win a great victory even though two more decisive battles in the following year 479 are necessary to drive the Persians away. But here's what Aeschylus has described in his play Persians. He he's a he's having the story told by and by I guess it's actually I'm trying to remember it may well have been a Persian who was telling this story but in any case probably not it was one of the Greeks. Anyway here's what he says a mighty shout greeted our ears on you sons of hell us free your homeland free your children your wives the homes of your father's gods and the tombs of your ancestors. In other words does this play was put on something like oh about I think it's about seven years after the Battle of Salem is so it's it's almost a contemporary event and you can see that from the first the Greeks view this war as being about freedom as opposed to many other possible considerations.

Speaker 2:          00:03:59       And in the spring and the following year in 479 there were two great battles that decided the outcome of the war. Finally on the land the battle of Plata in southern B OCA in which a great Greek army which included the major cities including especially Sparta and Athens took on a powerful Persian land army and defeated them on land.

Speaker 1:          00:04:29       Herodotus says on the very same day it would be a wonderful coincidence if it were true but it may be true a fundamentally a sea battle was fought off the coast of Asia Minor at my Cally where again the Greek fleet once more destroyed the Persian fleet and at that point the Persians had no choice but simply to flee and to try to escape the the Greeks who were pursuing them and doing their best to kill as many of them as they could now. After my colleague a very important event took place that cast a long shadow about the future of what was going to happen in that part of the world. There was a conference held on the island of Samos perhaps one of the most important of the Ionian Islands off the coast which brought to the to the to the Greek Council that had been conducting the war.

Speaker 1:          00:05:35       It brought the island states of chaos Lesbos and Samos. These are the three largest most important islands that are located off the coast of Asia Minor. All of them had taken advantage of the presence of the Greek forces in that region to rebel against the Persians. And now they wanted to be admitted to the league that the Greeks had formed in for any one to resist the Persian invasion the Greeks referred to themselves to that league simply as the hellions the Greeks and it's convenient to think about it as the Greek league meant to fight the Persians in that war. Now this might seem like a simple thing to do why not accept these three Greek states all of them potentially powerful and important who want to join the Greek league. One thing I think we need to understand at once that we won't comprehend the situation at all.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       We know that the Persian Wars are over. We know that the Persians just ran away and weren't going to come back and challenge this Greek victory for the longest time. But the Greeks didn't know it. The Persian Empire was still intact it was still an extraordinarily extensive rich and powerful empire. There was no reason why the Greeks should not believe that the Persians would be coming again. And if we don't grasp that then all of what they do now makes no sense. Well chaos Samos and lemon and Lesbos wanted to be sure that they would be protected by this Greek league. If and when the Persians came back and tried to put them back into the Persian Empire and so there was a conference but there was not a unity of intention. When the Greeks have to discuss shall we take these people into our league basically the Spartans said no.

Speaker 1:          00:07:45       And the reasons for that I'm not so very strange. The Spartans certainly could conclude with security that there wasn't very much danger that in the foreseeable future the Persians would come marching into Greece again and and present a threat to the Peloponnese and to the Spartan predominance in that area. And we all know by now that the Spartans were most reluctant to be far from home anyway didn't like to have to cross the sea to get to a battlefield and didn't want their army out there on any permanent basis. Everything in their tradition said bring the army home put an end to this activity and they didn't want to take on the responsibility of bringing these islanders into their league so that they would have to go and fight for their freedom on the other hand the Athenians took the opposite view. They were very much in favor of bringing these states into this thing. Is this thing working. Is this normal. Can you hear me back there.

Speaker 3:          00:08:59       Nothing's happening up here. You want to forward this. I can't tell. No it's not working. A little bit all right.

Speaker 1:          00:09:10       Anyway I'll just continue to talk. While technology takes place. Mm hmm. Anyway the Athenians thought differently and that's not surprising either because their situation was quite different from that of the Spartans. They were. On the sea. They were accustomed to be at sea. Moreover as we've seen and said several times they had very important supply line like.

Speaker 4:          00:09:48       Lines of communication and transportation in order to feed themselves they needed to go out there and have freedom of the seas and that meant that they had to see to it that the Persians were indeed driven from the Aegean Sea and the hellish spot. And yet the straits in general and the access to the Black Sea. So for those reasons alone the Athenians would have had to take seriously this request by the islanders. But it's also true that at least some of the islanders Samos particularly were Ionian. As you remember kinsman of the Athenians the Athenians were recognized as the leader of the Ionian people. So there was that that sentimental attachment as well. But most strikingly I think we have to understand that the Athenians understood the Persians have to be kept away from the Aegean Sea and the Athenians also wanted very much because ever since the rebellion of 499 the Athenians had wanted to liberate.

Speaker 5:          00:11:00       The Greeks of Asia Minor from the Persian rule. You've got. Thanks very much so. And the Athenians won the argument. It was agreed to take these three island states into the Greek league and that meant that the Greeks would be committed to protect them should the Persians attack them again and in accordance with these decisions the commander of the Spartan fleet out there kingly O ticket has sailed home and took his Spartans. And I would imagine this helping nations with him on the other hand the commander of the Athenian fleet sent sippers state and carried on the war against the Persians in the area. Let me just give you a small clue since us. We'll have a son. Sorry.

Speaker 6:          00:11:57       He has a son in the here for 79 whose name is parrot Cleaves and we will be hearing of course a lot about him later on since it is the Persians have fled but there are a few places in Europe that along the road the route of their escape where the Persians left still had control of a town or a city here and there.

Speaker 4:          00:12:23       And one of the most important was the town of systems located on the European side of the the Dardanelles and so sand Cyprus besieged the city with the Athenian and the rest the Navy and the rest of the Greek ships that were still there.

Speaker 7:          00:12:43       And after a while took the city by siege and cleared the Persians out of their the result of the war was of course first of all the vindication a validation of Greek freedom.

Speaker 5:          00:13:00       Greeks would indeed continue to be able to live the lives that they had been accustomed to but another thing had happened which was going to make an enormous impact on Greek life. You perhaps will remember that before the Persian invasion but not long before. I believe it's in the year for 82 to the silver mines in the south of Attica had yielded an unusual strike a vein of silver had been discovered that was much more than normal. And so much so that something had to be decided by the Athenian assembly what shall we do with the silver.

Speaker 6:          00:13:44       And this is a wonderful insight into the way Greeks thought about their place at the first thought. The one that was most popular to begin with was well let's take the silver and divide it up equally among the Athenians that in some sense the the polls was a kind of a joint stock company and when there was a nice dividend you just doled out to the investors. So Mr. Cleese thought otherwise mystically as was it's evident constantly aware of the threat from Persia and of the importance of getting ready to fight the Persians. Then he understood I think before most other Greeks that the Navy was going to be really critical in this operation. And so he made the suggestion that the silver strike be used to build a whole fleet of new ships for the Athenians and they end up with two hundred try rings which is to the tri RIM is the battleship of the ancient Greeks.

Speaker 6:          00:14:55       So that. That is the core of the fleet which is the one that defeats the Persians at salaries and defeats them again at my Kelly the Spartans were given command of the war against Persia both on land and sea. But the Spartans didn't have any great skill or experience in naval matters. And the Athenians had more than they and it was the Athenian portion of the fleet which was the largest and the most effective in fighting those naval battles and of course the battle of Solomon was fought in Athenian waters. And so Mr. Cleaves with his clever devices had come up with a way of winning victory. First of all compelling the Greeks to fight its elements and then winning the victory itself. Now the point of all this is one of the changes that has come upon the Greek world as a result of this Persian invasion is that there is something new in the Greek world a big Athenian Navy and it has proven itself already to be an extraordinarily capable Navy. And that is a new power factor. And the whole idea of naval power being very decisive in Greek affairs is a relatively new idea. That's not to say that there weren't states that had navies before and naval battles and in some cases that these were very important. But we're really at another level. After the Athenians have built this fleet and had the success that they have made they had.

Speaker 7:          00:16:36       And another consequence of the war was of course the tremendous boom that came in Greek self-confidence it really.

Speaker 5:          00:16:50       I can't emphasize enough what an incredible upset this was no one would have imagined that if the great king was got really serious and sent over an army of well you know one hundred thousand two hundred thousand nobody knows exactly how many Herodotus his numbers are. It is widely agreed exaggerated but there's a very big army and a very big Navy certainly outnumbers the Greeks in both cases. And if anybody would have thought that was going to be an easy victory for the Persians to defeat that meant an enormous amount. And the Greeks came away feeling that their general prejudice of their own superiority over everybody else had been justified by their performance in the Persian Wars the Athenians no less. Of course because of the very central role that they had played. So all of these are new things that are in the hearts and minds of the Greeks and by no means trivial.

Speaker 5:          00:17:53       There was a sense that the Greeks had done something remarkably glorious not to be forgotten which made them proud and made them I think also rather ambitious to continue in that course. And finally one other point I would want to make in that is this is the first great pan hellenic activity really. There had been some sense in which the Greeks were increasingly aware that there was something called Helen's Greek people's. Different from people who were not hellions. And this took probably took shape most fully when they competed in the major athletic contests at major religious festivals in which they were fundamentally Greek even though. Well they were entirely Greek really. So that would have fostered this sense of handhelds. But nothing could have given it a tremendous boost that it got like this victory of these 31 states that had banded together to defeat the Persians in that war.

Speaker 5:          00:19:02       So Pan Helen ism is now on the horizon. I don't mean to say that the Greeks are shaped now. Into a single people have retreated from their localism and their love for the Poles. Nothing could be further from the truth. But alongside of their love of autonomy and love of their place there was the idea that pan Helen ism was a good thing. It had a kind of a nice ring to it. It's the sort of thing that I feel some familiarity with. Not that I was around right after the first world war but reading about it you realized that there was some sense after that war. That the victorious peoples had something in common and that in any case they could work together to achieve international peace and in a way that hadn't been thought of much before. But even more strongly I think the idea after the Second World War when this idea took even stronger route to the point where people have this crazy religious feeling or at least some of them do about the desire to avoid having parochial national interests determine what you're going to do in international relations.

Speaker 5:          00:20:28       Everything has to be done somehow as though there were a rule a world government that really existed and really managed things and although everybody knows that's not true it's thought to be bad form to face that fact. Well something like that kind. Not as bad as that but something like that kind of unreality was in the minds of Greeks because you will be hearing over the next century various thinkers and speakers who want to make the case that a thing is good if it's somehow pan hellenic. That's a fine thing. So it's an idea that's there. Not that any state any more than our nations have given up any sovereignty or any independence or any autonomy. It's an idea and that's all that it is.

Speaker 5:          00:21:21       Another consequence of the war was a division in the Greek within the Greek world that was in part based upon the fact that Athens said Come on in that war to become a great power. And by anybody's reckoning had played one of the leading roles in the victory. Now the Spartans had to the Spartans were the official leaders and their Regent had been the commander at the great land battle at Pelletier and their general was in charge of the Navy. But Athens had become so important so big so successful that there was now a question. I mean it was part of really the leader of the Greeks. What was the future. Was the future going to be one in which the Spartans would maintain the unique leadership of the Greeks or would the Athenians challenge them. It soon became clear that the Athenians would indeed challenge them and so a major theme may be the major theme in international relations for the next 50 years will be the conflict between Athens and Sparta.

Speaker 5:          00:22:43       And a lot of it I think could be described really as a Cold War. Because there is no fighting between the two states between for 79 and about 460 or even a little bit late. Actually I don't come into conflict themselves until four fifty seven again. And when that war stops there is a period once again of peace and then we come to the great Peloponnesian War which dominates the last third of the century. That's all in the future. But what's clear now is that there's got to be some new arrangement some new alignment to face up to the change in the power structure.

Speaker 8:          00:23:23       There was only one great power before the war. There clearly are two after the war.

Speaker 5:          00:23:32       Well the Greeks also had to decide certain questions that had been created by the war. One of them who's to be the leader if there is to be a leader of the Greeks. But beyond that there was some Greek states that had gone over to the Persians in the course of the war and the Greeks refer to these people as me or. What should be done with the me dies. I'm sure there were proposals from one extreme that would have said just wipe those cities out to the other extreme which would have said well let bygones be bygones. But there were opinions all along the middle of the way. And so that remained an issue that had to be settled somehow. And then behind it all was the question What shall we look for in the future. Was Persia going to be a threat once again which would imply one whole set of policies or can we consider the threat from Persia finished so that we can go back to our normal way without adjusting to that policy.

Speaker 5:          00:24:44       And in for the reasons I've already indicated the Spartans and the the nations who have a lot more likely to take the view that the threat was over the Athenians the islanders and the Ionian and the I should say the Asiatic Greeks would take the view that no there is a very imminent danger from the Persians. The war isn't over. We need to continue to fight it. Now let me then try to describe the way in which a new way of dealing with the Persians would come onto the scene and for that I need to take you back to for any one year when Xerxes started his march from the Persian empire against the Greeks. The Greeks knew this was happening and they met. You will remember at Corinth in 481 when those 31 cities came together and swore that they would fight together to defeat the Persians. They appointed Sparta. Officially as the head Jarmon the leader of that league which meant that the Spartans would be in command on land and sea and once the battles commenced that they would be in charge. But of course the decisions as to what to do what where to go to fight went to fight and so on were made by the Council of Greeks who were participating in the Spartans did not attempt to impose their wishes.

Speaker 6:          00:26:23       At that point so that the league really functions like a league of equals but of course the states are not equal in their power. So that is much more influenced by the Spartans. But there's also a lot of influence by the Athenians because of the size of their fleet. That's the way things were working in the Greek league against Persia. Even though the Spartans are the hedge German Do not confuse this league with the Peloponnesian league. It is something quite different. I've already described the league to you and so you know that the relationships are different and the membership is different. The Greek league has states that are not in the Peloponnese and have not previously been allied to Sparta. It also includes Spartans traditional Peloponnesian allies they swear this common oath the Greeks are to fight for the common freedom to free the Greeks and the islands and Asia Minor and it is to be a perpetual League as we know because as late as four sixty one. I guess the when there was a conflict between Athens and Sparta the Athenians in fact withdraw from their alliance with the Greeks under Spartan rules.

Speaker 5:          00:27:46       So that tells us that until then they fell for themselves still to be part of that Greek league they agreed and for anyone to put aside the quarrels that they may have had at the time and to have the same friends and enemies the famous clause that means a common foreign policy. But it doesn't mean again it just because the Spartans ahead us doesn't mean the Spartans will determine that policy the policy will be determined by the league in its own meetings it is to be a typical Greek alliance. The Greek word for that is simple. Here it means an offensive and defensive alliance. I will fight along your side not only if you are attacked. But if you go to war against somebody else at your own discretion. I still am bound to be your ally. That's what I say mafia is so far as we know that's the only kind of international alliance that the Greeks knew.

Speaker 5:          00:28:45       Up to that time offensive and defensive nothing is said about money. There is no provision for providing funds for the league. I think that implies very clearly each state would pay for its own forces when they were engaged in the common cause. There was no provision for regular meetings. Meetings would be held when they were thought to be necessary. And of course everything would have to be done by the common consent. I don't mean that there was a need for unanimity but there certainly would have to be a general agreement of things. For the game to go forward. This is a new thing. It's an innovation and of course it fits in nicely with what I said a moment ago about the concept of Pan Helen ism coming forward. This is the first pan hellenic expedition I suppose since the Trojan War now.

Speaker 5:          00:29:55       Sparta. As as you've seen when the decision had to be made as to whether they should commit themselves to defending the islands with a kind of a permanent force out there to do that the Spartans withdrew. Nothing is formal there's no change in the arrangements but they just decided to go home. And now we see that the Athenians will be pursuing a different policy. The one that was ultimately adopted by most of the Greeks but which allowed the Athenians to come forward and make the kinds of claims for their influence that they would one of the first things the Athenians wanted to do. I should remind you that the Persians had marched into Attica and done fearful damage to the police of Athens the palace of Athens and had done great harm to the city of Athens had gone up to the Acropolis destroyed the temples that existed there a terrible sacrilege from the point of view of the Athenians and they wanted to do what they could to see this would never happen again.

Speaker 5:          00:31:05       And so they undertook to build the walls around the. I hope it's going to come to me in a minute the Acropolis stronger than they had been. And also to make the city walls stronger than they had been. Now it's interesting it's an interesting sign of the way some of the other Greek states felt that when the Athenians set about building their walls there were complaints from some of the Greek allies to the Spartans that the Athenians were doing this and saying this was a bad idea. My guess is that the complainants would have included such cities as thieves Majora probably currents thieves and mega of being both neighbors a budding on Attica and old enemies of the Athenians and the Corinthians being just next door so to speak. Not quite on their border but also a state that was undoubted will undoubtedly challenge by the emergence of Athens as a great naval power and a great commercial power.

Speaker 5:          00:32:22       Currents had happened that had one of the biggest navies and cards for the longest time had been a great commercial power. The archeological evidence is that it was being challenged in the latter respect by the Athenians as early as in the 6th century. So these are the kind of states that would have been complaining and thinking that if the Athenians had a walled city that they could defend that would make them more confident and possibly more aggressive and more trouble for their neighbors and in the war the Athenians should had shown an astonishing daring especially at sea which obviously was making some of their old enemies and neighbors nervous Well the Spartans heard about it and they heeded their friend's complaints enough.

Speaker 9:          00:33:24       So that's the mistake please. Who was I need to point out to you though I'm sure you know it emerged from the war as the great hero. He had done so many wonderful things. He was responsible for the Athenian Navy. He was responsible for the decision to fight at Salomon. He was responsible people believe for the victory it's Alan as we hear. Butcher tells wonderful stories about in the Olympic Games right after the war. People will watching the games when the mystically is arrive. They stop watching the games and they watch domestically. Because so great was the admiration and wonder that he created. I always I try to figure out some analogy now but I can't if you imagine if you could wrap up Roosevelt Churchill and Stalin and make him one person after a second world war. You might have something like what mystically is dead. So so mystically goes to Sparta. And he of course is the main champion in Athens of Athens rebuilding its walls as fast as possible and Athens taking the most forward position possible in the Navy at sea and in international relations in general.

Speaker 5:          00:34:41       And he does this little trick that the facilities described. He says he will go to to Sparta but the Spartans either send some people to Athens too. And then he tells the Athenians to hold those Spartans there until he gets home. The next thing he says is let me know when the walls have been built high enough to defend so he goes to talk to the Spartans as fights as we hear you guys are building walls around there. You know I know it's your own business but we don't think that's a good idea because if the Persians come again they could use your walled city as a base against us if you can follow that kind of reasoning. Your sharper than I am. But anyway that's the story they told isn't it.

Speaker 10:         00:35:29       Where did you hear that nonsense. We're building walls up. A lot of baloney. Forget about it. I'm sorry I haven't told the story quite right. He says Look don't take my word for it. You send an embassy to Athens and take a look. That's when he told his friends. Keep those guys there until I get home. So one day the message I'm a messenger from Athens comes to the mystic leaves and tells him OK. The walls can now be defended whereupon mystically says to the Spartans you know those walls you were complaining about. You were right.

Speaker 5:          00:35:59       We do have them and they're now big enough that we can defend ourselves against them. And what are you going to do about and then he delivers a speech which is a kind of a declaration not so much of independence as of equivalence to the Spartans. His message was we don't take orders from you keep your advice to yourselves. We'll take care of ourselves. You take care of yourselves. You are not our superiors. We are your equals was the essence of what he said. Thereafter Mr. it was not so popular in Sparta as it used to be. Indeed for the rest of his life the Spartans will be trying to do him harm and remove him from the scene. But he certainly achieves what he wants. The Athenians are a walled city and they have declared that whatever their formal technical relationship with Sparta might be under the Hellenic League.

Speaker 5:          00:36:58       The fact is they are independent players and they're going to do things as they see fit. Consider this says the Spartans accepted this but secretly they were embittered. I think that's the first clue we have to what will become a continuing situation in Sparta for the rest of the time we pay attention to them that there will be a factional division among Spartans. At least this much is true. I'm sure it's much more complicated than we know but in the simplest way there was some Spartans who were content to withdraw back to the Peloponnese is to have nothing to do with the world outside the Peloponnese is much less with the world of the Aegean Sea and beyond and try to return to their traditional ways. A peace faction if you will a conservative faction perhaps but that there is also starting now as a result of the victory in the war.

Speaker 5:          00:38:05       A faction of Spartans that would like to exert Spartan power and influence more broadly. At least to incur include the rest of the Greek states of the mainland but also a number of them surely felt that they wanted to exert power everywhere including overseas as well. But that that faction that second faction doesn't win the argument they have to be secretly embittered because the official policy of Sparta is to accept this. The Athenian situation and we'll see in a moment that events move them in the same direction. The commander of the Spartan forces at play here who emerges as the leading figure immediately after the war he is POW seniors who was there a region but effectively one of the two kings of. Sparta. He goes out to the Aegean Sea. Member of the previous king in commander had retired but now pass any it takes a fleet and he goes out there and he proceeds to make the Greeks first he perceives to be very effective against the Persians.

Speaker 5:          00:39:21       He does some fighting particularly in the hellish spot and the Straits in general Byzantium is a very important city there. What later becomes Constantinople and then Istanbul and the and the little town across the way so they control the Straits. He defeats the Persians and so on but in the process he makes enemies among the Greeks part of the reason is because he treats the Greeks as inferiors as if they were underlings of the Spartans. In general it appears to have been a common Spartan problem that when they went out of Sparta and had commanding positions over other Greeks they regularly treated them in that way different degrees of course poor seniors must have been particularly annoying. But there were main complaints about how they were treated by his Greek allies. In addition he became very much caught up in the great wealth and luxury that the Persians demonstrated.

Speaker 8:          00:40:38       Greeks were most Greeks were at least theoretically very appalled at the morals or the lack of morals of the Persians from their perspective but their Persians were first of all very rich and Greeks were not.

Speaker 5:          00:40:53       And they use their wealth for various purposes all of which were seen to be on Greek and unattractive parsimonious fell for it. And he began behaving as though he were a Persian sat track at the very least. All of these things as I say irritated their fellow Greeks who began to bring charges against him. He was charged in Sparta with first of all tyranny and then second of all treason. He was alleged to have been cut out to have cut some kind of a deal with the Persian ruler and his set traps against the common cause. The this was effective enough to have him recall and put on trial. He was acquitted on the other hand. He was not sent out again to be the commander. He was put on the side. Later on further charges would be brought against him and he would indeed be put to death.

Speaker 5:          00:41:54       OK. But the main point is that the Spartans have withdrawn their commander pretty much in disgrace with the rest of the Greeks. They send out a replacement. A man called Dorcas. The allies don't accept him and they say no we're not taking any Spartan commanders these days and send him back home. That is an extremely important step. The allies. And that means now the people in the Aegean Sea and on its borders the people who are in what will be first the Athenian sphere of influence and then the Athenian Empire. These are the states that they that don't want Spartan rule. And I think the main reason is well there's a couple of reasons one is a the behavior of past enemies has discredited the Spartans but the other I think is this look how much evidence do you need that the Spartans really don't like this kind of thing.

Speaker 5:          00:42:54       You remember they had voted against taking those three islands into the league even back there in 479. So. And the other thing is that here are the Athenians the guys who really won the war at sea which is the one you're concerned about and who are apparently ready and waiting to continue to do that. And it was I think that choice that was in the minds of the allies when they sent Dorcas home and said please no more. And the Spartans did not send a replacement for Dorcas. They in other words accepted that they would not participate in the future campaigns against Persia which would be obviously aggressive campaigns in Asia since the Persians had been driven out of Europe and out of the Aegean Sea. Facility says this about the Spartan decision. They also wanted to be rid of the Persian War and believed that the Athenians were competent to lead and were at the present time well-disposed to the Spartans. Why not. They said we don't want to fight this war. We don't really care about those things and everything will be OK because the Athenians can do it and they're all friends but surely that was not what all the Spartans saw.

Speaker 5:          00:44:23       That was the opinion of the faction that won the argument which was the conservative faction the one that was the peace party. And let's stay in the Peloponnese party was still the predominant force and I suspect their position had been strengthened by the disgrace brought upon Sparta by the behavior of seniors and no doubt by the rejection of the Spartan replacement by the other Greeks. Why should we force ourselves. We are making ourselves unpopular. It used to be the Greeks came to us and begged us to fight and protect them when they were in trouble. And now they're rejecting our leadership. That's because we shouldn't be out there. This is not our kind of a campaign. This is. Well what can go on and imagine the arguments that we use did this mean that there would be no continuing campaign against Persia. Certainly not. That is not what the allies meant. They turned to Athens and asked the Athenians to take the lead in the war that was going to cost Herodotus has a line in which he says the Athenians offered the hubris of power seniors as a pretext for taking over the leadership of the Greeks out there that suggests that the Athenians were planning to do just that that they very much wanted to and that they were engaged in maneuvers to bring it about. That it was their idea that they took the initiative.

Speaker 5:          00:46:12       But I think that's not right. I let me back up a step. It's only partly right. What is certainly clear is that the Athenians were ready and willing to do what they were asked but the idea that they either use their power and influence or their wiles to bring the allies to take that decision when they would not have otherwise done so. I think that is wrong. I'm gonna start doing something that you may get tired of after a. I want to use an analogy that I find very illuminating anyway. The analogy of the formation of NATO after the Second World War and the formation of the deeply in League which is ultimately turned into the Athenian Empire after the Persian Wars in the case of the dealing league I think the Norwegian or Swedish scholar has described the process whereby NATO was invented as the establishment of head Germany by invitation.

Speaker 5:          00:47:20       That is if you look at the situation nineteen forty five six seven eight nine the European states that ultimately became part of NATO desperately wanted the Americans to join with them not to repeat what they had done after the first world war which was to retreat back into North America to have no connections of a political military kind with Europe which terrified the European states that were sort of knocked down so hard by the Second World War and who were afraid that the Soviet Union was going to take them over and they desperately wanted the Americans to take the lead. Now the Americans were glad to do it. I don't mean all the Americans. As always there were factions and the differences of opinions and the the American president and his government had to fight hard to convince Americans to do it. But by and large they did and those who won the argument were of the opinion that American interests first of all in reaching restoring Europe to its previous condition and secondly to resisting communist takeover Soviet takeover of Europe meant that it was in America's interests to see that such a situation develop both sides I would argue were equally glad to see what happened because it was in the interest of both sides.

Speaker 5:          00:48:48       So I think it was in for seven to eight seven when the formation of the Dalian League took place. Obviously the states that were bordering on the Persian Empire and in the seas next to Asia Minor were absolutely at risk if the Persians came back. Supposing the Athenians said they weren't interested and had gone home just as the Persians said there was no Greek force except for the poor Asiatic Greeks themselves to resist a Persian return and they couldn't possibly resist that. So for them it was a life and death matter at least it was a matter of freedom versus slavery that they should persuade the Athenians to take the lead. But for the Athenians who won the argument it was obvious they felt our needs for instance access to the Black Sea. However our feelings. Friendship for the Greeks of Asia Minor and our fear fear of what the Persians might do if they got rolling.

Speaker 5:          00:49:51       All point to the same outcome. And so I think both sides were equally glad to undertake this new path. I think we will be deeply mistaken if we imagine that anybody imposed his will on anybody else in this matter and in fact the Athenians according to Plutarch story needed persuasion. Plutarch tells the tale of Aristophanes who was in command of the Athenian fleet there off Asia Minor at the time when the same eons particularly took the lead and came to the Athenians into Aristophanes and said Won't you please be our leaders. Aristotle said before we do that you show us that you are really committed to us and that you will not simply use us. I mean I'm putting in stuff that's not a complete task. Now don't use us as a kind of a way of convincing the Spartans to stay and then leave us in the lurch.

Speaker 5:          00:50:56       So you ladies the commander of the samy and Navy turned took his ship sailed it against the flagship of poor seniors. This is at the time and past seniors is still around and rams that ship. Well that ought to take care of any possibility of playing footsie with the Spartans. At which point the Athenians accept the leadership and then move forward with the plan for doing so in the winter of 478 seven. There was a meeting of the Greeks who are interested at the island of deep loss. The losses right smack in the middle of the Aegean Sea and as I've told you it is the birthplace of Apollo and Artemus and Apollo of course is got a special fondness for the irony. And so it's the natural place for this to happen and they come up with what amount is essentially a constitutional convention. They come up with a constitution that will describe how the league is to work. The aims of the league are. That the members of the league will fight against the Persians first of all to avenge what the Persians did to the Greeks and secondly to collect booty from the Persians to pay for the damage that the Persians did. So that is a part of the story I think of course.

Speaker 5:          00:52:30       Implicit. It didn't have to be said that the primary motive must be to maintain or establish I would guess and maintain the freedom of the Greeks from Persian rule. The city doesn't mention that and some scholars have been misled into thinking that somehow that wasn't part of the story. Well how could they do the rest of it if they didn't do that. These states were obviously in danger of being taken by the Persians so their freedom had to be the maintenance of their freedom had to be step number one and surely that was clear in their minds. They agreed as it was typical in the Greek alliances to have the same friends and enemies common foreign policy and to carry this forward. They all swore oaths that's their form of signing treaties they don't sign treaties they swear oaths then they dropped. Iron chunks of iron into the sea as a symbol that this treaty was to be perpetual.

Speaker 5:          00:53:38       That is to say it would last until the iron came up and floated on the surface. They knew that wasn't going to happen. So they are us a standard kind of an alliance with a perpetual I need to make the point that most Greek alliances that we hear of in this period are not the the unions and the Spartans in four forty five make a thirty years piece in four twenty one they make fifty years peace on another occasion they make a five year peace that's that's the way they do things normally this is different. This is like. The Greek Lee. This is a perpetual alliance. The membership of the league as best we can figure it out. This is not 100 percent accurate but it's not bad. It includes a first of all informally at this point it divides the league up into zones one is the islands of the GNC and we have knowledge of 20 towns that are members from the islands Ionia that is on the coast of Asia Minor itself 36 towns along the Hellas Pantene route into the Black Sea 35 carrier which is the southern coast of Asia Minor has 24 3s which is the northern shore of the Aegean Sea in Greek territory is thirty is thirty three comes to a total of one hundred and forty eight.

Speaker 5:          00:55:17       You imagine you're talking about one hundred and fifty towns you've got the general idea right. So that's quite an amazing thing. Peloponnesian league certainly didn't have anything like that in terms of numbers of states. But don't be too carried away because lots of these places are just tiny little spots especially when you're talking about islands. Some of the islands states in the Aegean and they apparently were just about all members are very small indeed. Still it includes some very important states like those big islands I mentioned already Samos chaos and Lesbos and others that were not quite as big and some states on the Asian side that were old and big and important cities. My leaders being one example of it. So there it is. Notice what I have not including no Taliban nations. This is not in any shape manner or form connected with the Peloponnesian Lee and I like.

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       I think I'm going to play my analogy game in a moment too. But what I want to say is you need to be easiest I think for you to grasp what's going on. If you think of three separate organizations first there's the Greek league against Persia that was formed in for eighty one which includes Peloponnesian states and non Peloponnesian states. Then keep in mind the oldest of these. I should have mentioned first the Peloponnesian League which is older than the Greek League which includes four. For our purposes essentially only Peloponnesian states. There are a couple of exceptions but none are are across the sea in any way. And then there's this newly which we should call the Dalian league. Although the Greeks referred to it as the Greeks just as they had the earlier lead. But this that it's easier to think of it as the deal in league to separate it from that league.

Speaker 5:          00:57:18       OK here's the analogy that I suggest that the Greek league against Persia we might think of as being like the United Nations organization because it includes states from both sides from all of these places. And I think if we think of the Peloponnesian Lee as one of the subordinate leagues and the dealing league as the other. In other words like NATO on the one hand and the Warsaw Pact on the other. That will be a helpful analogy because first of all both of them are members of the Greek league too. And but as the United Nations Organization charter permits regional associations. So NATO and the Warsaw Pact where regional associations so too without there being any formality about it. It clearly didn't mean to abolish the Peloponnesian league and therefore there was no reason why they shouldn't be a different regional alliance like that of the dealing only that I think is the structure of the international system in Greece as we move past the Persian Wars now let's say a little bit more about that deal league.

Speaker 5:          00:58:38       There are more things you need to know about it. It is a germinal league. Just like the Peloponnesian league that is there is a designated leader. Athens is the designated regiment of the league and there is also something that's something quite different something new since this is a naval league. It costs money in a way that a military league made of hotlines citizens doesn't. So it was clear there had to be some league money a league Treasury for this purpose. They declared the collection of something they called a force Ross P H O R O S it just simply means in the most neutral sense contribution. As time passed this contribution was seen to be something imposed upon unwilling payers and in English. We we use the word to describe it as tribute. But let's think now for the moment only about the beginning of the league and what was intended at first.

Speaker 5:          00:59:54       So there is this contribution which becomes the league Treasury the assessor was an Athenian general Aristotle's REIT is the just as he was known. He told each state how much it would be required to contribute. This took the form in the beginning. In some cases of ships and crews to Rosen and in other states from the very beginning. Money. Now I think we should imagine that the earlier you are in the league the more there are. Allied ships and crews. And as you get later and later until finally you're into the Peloponnesian War just about every state doesn't have a fleet of its own doesn't supply cruise but just pays money. Again I urge you to think about the beginning and not worry about the end just now. So the Athenian assesses that there is also an Athenian citizen who will be chosen for the job of treasurer of this new league Hellenic Tommy us as the Greek.

Speaker 5:          01:01:01       The Greek word and he will see to the collection and the security of that money and Athenian does that also. Any military or naval campaigns conduct conducted on behalf of the Dalian league will have an Athenian general in charge. Now you know looking at it backwards you can say well this is Athenian imperialism and the Athenians are imposing their power on no. The Allies would have been the first to want to do this because what they were afraid of. Just because the Europeans were afraid in the 40s was not that the ally that the Athenians would lorded over them. They were afraid that the Athenians would run away and leave them to their fate. They wanted to tie the Athenians into this new organization. Now this deal in league is unsurpassed among the few international organizations there are in the Greek world. It was enormously efficient because you had a leader who was designated and interested and deeply involved.

Speaker 5:          01:02:08       You had. An organ for making decisions. I haven't mentioned it but there was what they called the synod of the league gets the Council of the league in which there are representatives from every state and it can make all the decisions that have to be made in that one place. Unlike these other places it has its own money and its own forces which are assigned to it by the Constitution. All of these things make that a much more effectively able to do what it has to do without any great difficulty in the decision making process and to make that a little clearer I need to tell you another thing.

Speaker 5:          01:02:54       In the Synod the arrangement was one state one vote so Athens was a one member of that Synod Athens which had the lion's share of the power. Had only one vote. So how could the Athenians have their way. You may ask but the way it really worked was because Athens had all of this prestige and all of this power it meant all of the very small powerless states huddled under the wings of the Athenians and could be counted on to deliver the right sort of vote to do what the Athenians told him. Whereas supposing they had used something like proportional representation given the Athenians X number of votes a lot of votes but they would have had to give safe source and I don't mean face to face all still but Samos chaos Lesbos all these big towns and islands numerous votes as well and they would certainly have been more votes than the Athenians had. They could have voted then the Athenians if they got together under this one man one one state one vote rule. That's impossible.

Speaker 8:          01:04:12       We never never hear of any trouble passing whatever the Athenians want in the assembly. There's just no check on their doing what they want in a constitutional way now.

Speaker 5:          01:04:32       So long as everybody's playing by the original rules this doesn't really present any serious problem. But as time passes and there are differences of opinion. And as for various reasons I will explain. The Athenians begin to assert their power and begin to change the situation. It's at that point that the question of autonomy will arise and the Athenians will in fact interfere with the autonomy of the other states and turn the league ultimately into what the Greeks called an ah Hey which we rightly translate as an empire. But once again I don't want you to think about that when you're thinking about the situation in 477 that's in the future and that's not what people are expecting or wanting.

Speaker 8:          01:05:23       There is a common interest and it's very strong and 477 to deal with the threat of the Persia. And to get revenge and payment from the Persians for what has happened the problem only emerges or problems emerge when the challenge from Persia recedes and as we shall see that's of course was the same problem that NATO suffered from and suffers from today which is to the degree that they don't feel threatened by anything the states that are allied to the United States don't feel they have to do what the Americans want. And that's the way it was when the situation developed in Greece. OK so that's the original situation of the dealing only.

Speaker 5:          01:06:12       And I want to turn next to the story of how that turns into the Athenian Empire. And the first thing I want to indicate to you is that the success of the deal only from the outset was extraordinary. Well one little town that was still in Persian hands in 477 was the town of E.ON located at the mouth of the stream on river up in Thrace the Athenian commander took of league fleet to E.ON and drove the Persians out soon thereafter. By the way the dates that we have for this are very insecure. They are mostly derived from the story that two cities tells us it's a very the details are very few and he doesn't give us very many good dates if any. So there's a certain amount of estimation. It doesn't really matter from your point of view but I don't want I will give you dates that are those that are commonly accepted but you mustn't imagine that they're firmly fixed.

Speaker 5:          01:07:18       Anyway some years not too many after the establishment of the league the league under the great Athenian commander who will play a larger and larger role in league affairs and then and also in Athenian political affairs came on takes this force against the island of scare us in the Aegean. Scare us was attacked because it was not inhabited by Greeks. It was inhabited by non Greek peoples who made their living out of piracy. Well clearly all the states of the league had a lot to lose from allowing pirates to roam freely in their waters and so came on crushed. The Syrians pirates and to make sure he drove them from the island and he made sure that the island would be secure by putting an Athenian cleric. Remember that cleric. The Athenians put in a near Karl kiss. This is the same kind of arrangement Athenians of military age who permanently settle in scare us but retain their Athenian citizenship.

Speaker 5:          01:08:29       They are a garrison in effect to protect the island of scare us from falling into bad hands. In the future it was widely believed and justifiably that came on in that force had liberated the Aegean Sea. We never hear about piracy anymore. Piracy was a problem that the states in the Mediterranean in general suffered from a lot and at different times very very seriously. One thing that this new league even and when it's the daily league one becomes 18 an empire. There is no piracy in the region where that lead exists. Then they turn to the city of Christos which is at the southern end of the island WBA ends you remember had under the greatest military pressure actually surrendered to the Persians given earth and water and so technically they were mi visors and there was no mercy shown to them. They were compelled they didn't wish to do this but they were compelled to join the deal only and to pay a cash contribution not to be allowed to provide their own ships. Thus almost from the very beginning there is one instance of a state which doesn't fit the general picture I've been painting a state that is a subject state and is compelled to be a member but it's just this one case of a meat izing state.

Speaker 9:          01:10:06       Then possibly in the year 470 another development we hear that the island of Naxos seems to be an island full of trouble. Every time we hear of next us getting into difficulties or some kind or another but they decided that there wasn't any great threat from Persia that the Persians weren't coming back. And so they said we're quitting the league well I'm sure somebody said don't you remember you swore this oath you threw some higher lumps into the sea. Do you see any iron floating around here in the Aegean Sea. You're not quitting.

Speaker 5:          01:10:40       They rebelled the league sent the fleet. They put down the next rebellion and Nexus was now reduced from the category of a free ally. Making the kinds of contributions the other allied state did to another subject state which paid money didn't. The walls were taken down their fleet was taken away.

Speaker 9:          01:11:05       And that's the pattern that we shall see states who don't carry out their responsibilities states that particularly try to rebuild will be treated this way and their number will increase as time passes. Now so far by the way we do not hear of anybody in the league objecting to these decisions and these actions nor should we expect that there would be the allies still believed they needed this league and they weren't about to let people get a free ride such as Christmas would whether they paid or not. The Persians weren't going to attack them so they ought to pay for states like Naxos who decided well we feel safe enough so we quit. That wasn't gonna be permitted.

Speaker 5:          01:11:51       Well in a sense what you can really see from this is that the league was working as it was supposed to to be able to do the job that it had to and then if the dates are right in the next year 469 comes a very important turning point in the history of the league. The Persians have a fleet in the well I guess. You can't really call it the Aegean it's around the corner on the southern coast of Asia Minor. You remote on river flows out there and they had a fleet and an army inland. The league forces went there to that year Ramadan under the command of came on defeated and crushed the Persian fleet at sea landed and defeated the Persian army on the land. And that was a terrible blow to the Persian position in the eastern Mediterranean. The evidence is apparently that the Persians had a pull back.

Speaker 5:          01:12:55       From that entire area and it would not have been at all unreasonable for people to think well the Persian threat really is over. This is beyond what happened in 479. It's not just that we've driven them out of Europe. We've driven them away from the Mediterranean Sea. You could imagine that that's just the end of the Persian threat that was not the view taken by the Athenians or I guess by most of the allies. But we can imagine that there were some of the allies who were restless in their need to continue to make contributions to the league when they didn't feel that there was any purpose for the league anymore here. I gave a hint to this earlier. I don't remember what the general GRUNTS There was. The second commander of NATO. But he was anyway. He was an earlier commander of NATO. He's obviously a West Point man educated.

Speaker 5:          01:14:03       He knew all about facilities in the Peloponnesian War. And so he made the analogy between the first time I'm aware that anybody did between NATO and the Dalian league and he was doing so as commander of NATO at a period when he felt that the American allies in Europe were more and more reluctant to make the kinds of contributions that he thought they should make and was being wailing his situation which was every time the Russians looked like they were going to behave then the allies decided they didn't want to make any contributions. And then when the Russians look scary everybody came running and said sure sure we'll continue. And he suggested that's the way it was in the deal and league to. So keeping the back of your mind that there are real questions out there in the league as to whether it should persist and we'll carry this story forward next time.
