1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.030
So this morning we're going to start talking about Edmund Burke and the anti

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.320
enlightenment.
Um,

3
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.720
and one prefatory note is that,
um,

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.260
when thinking about political theory as opposed to every day political argument,

5
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.440
I think it's very important not to get hung up on labels such as left wing or

6
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:28.470
right wing or liberal or conservative.
Uh,

7
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.510
and I think the occasion of beginning to speak about Burke is a good moment to

8
00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:37.710
make this point.
After all,

9
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.510
I think be fair to say that before you walked into this course,

10
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.260
you would have,
if you had looked down in the syllabus and somebody had said,

11
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.940
who is the most radical thinker on this syllabus?
Most of the,

12
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.590
most of you would've picked out marks.
Um,
but as we've seen,

13
00:00:55.591 --> 00:01:00.540
Mark's is actually a footnote to the enlightenment marks is not,

14
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.930
he's not somebody who engages in a radical departure from the ideas that would

15
00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:08.520
develop by,
um,
lock.

16
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.780
And the other thing is that shaped the main ideas of the enlightenment.

17
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.850
Burke on the other hand is generally thought of as a conservative politically

18
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:20.880
and indeed he was a conservative politically,

19
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.560
but philosophically he's a much more radical thinker then marks was,

20
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.860
he is somebody who a re really goes to the root of accepted assumptions in his

21
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:37.870
critical questioning.
Um,

22
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.150
Burke completely rejects the enlightenment project as I have described it to you

23
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.260
today.
Um,
let me say a little bit about who he was.

24
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.330
He was born in 18,
29.
Uh,

25
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.770
so that makes him,
I mean 1729,
sorry,

26
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.830
gave him a hundred years there.
He was born in 17,

27
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:06.210
29 a quarter of a century after locked died.
Um,

28
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.360
and the main work for which he's most known there,

29
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.380
his reflections on the revolution in France was published in 1790 almost to

30
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.720
almost exactly a century after.

31
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I'm actually more like 110 years after Locke's second treaties.

32
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:28.230
Why should say it was published a hundred years after,

33
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:33.231
but it was written 110 years after because we now know that Locke wrote the

34
00:02:33.721 --> 00:02:37.770
second treaties in the,
in the early 1680s.

35
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.993
Um,

36
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.060
but what motivated Burke to write his reflections on the French revolution was

37
00:02:45.271 --> 00:02:45.720
the,

38
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.720
the s appalling carnage that eventually resulted from the French revolution.

39
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.310
Uh,
the,
you know,
the,

40
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.660
the French Revolution was not planned,
uh,
as a revolution.

41
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:05.830
It was really street riots that escalated in,
in,
in Paris,

42
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.000
but escalated to the point of the complete destruction of the whole society.
Uh,

43
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.460
the inauguration of a massive Chera,
uh,
which,
uh,

44
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.860
um,
uh,
Paul Burke.
And,
um,
so he wrote this,

45
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:24.490
this,
uh,
what started out as a pamphlet but,

46
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.520
but became this very famous book on the reflections on the revolution in France.

47
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.190
And that becomes a basis of Berks outlook.
Um,

48
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.200
he wasn't a professional scholar or academic.
He was actually a,
uh,
public,

49
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.340
uh,
person.
He was,
he would eventually become a member of parliament,

50
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:46.623
um,

51
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.220
and has some things to say about democratic representation that I will come back

52
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:54.880
to,
uh,
when we get to the theory of democracy.

53
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.560
But at the time he wrote the reflections on the revolution in France,

54
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:04.390
which is what I had you read excerpts from today.
Um,

55
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.840
he was mainly preoccupied with what had happened.

56
00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:11.550
What had transpired across the channel,
uh,

57
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.480
in 1789 and he was in particular,
um,

58
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.860
concerned to establish against people like Richard Price is one of the people

59
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:25.060
who engages there.

60
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.360
That's that 1789 was in any sense a logical follow on of 1688 in England,

61
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:34.540
1688,
of course,

62
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.500
when we had the revolution in England,

63
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.820
the Glorious Revolution of 1688,
um,
when,

64
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:47.380
when William was put on the throne,
which,
which locked offended,
um,

65
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.720
uh,
but from Burke's point of view,
that was a minor palace affair,

66
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.850
not a fundamental or radical revolution.
And in this sense,

67
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.020
uh,
Locke's view,
uh,
I'm sorry,
um,

68
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.790
Burke's view of the English revolution.
For those of you who are historians here,

69
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.840
you might be interested in now is very much at odds with the big new book called

70
00:05:12.461 --> 00:05:17.461
1688 just recently published by Professor Pincus in the history department here.

71
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.950
A very interesting book,
um,

72
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.090
which argues that 1688 was a much more radical break with the past.

73
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.010
Then,
uh,
people thought at the time and suddenly then Burke thought,

74
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:38.011
because Burke thought that 1688 was not a radical break with the past where 1789

75
00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:44.110
in France was a radical break with the past.

76
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.150
And I think that,
um,

77
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.540
another thing to say before we get into the particulars of Berks view is that

78
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.280
unlike everybody else you've read in this course,

79
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.340
Burke Renae does not have a theory of politics.

80
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.990
He does not have,
um,

81
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.670
a set of premises that you can lay out,
um,

82
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.070
conclusions to which he wants to get.

83
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.290
And then chains of reasoning that get him from a to B from the premises to the

84
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:19.550
conclusion.
There is no theory of politics in Berg.

85
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.800
There's no this,
you know,

86
00:06:21.801 --> 00:06:26.540
we think it would con we thought got universalize it rd.
Um,

87
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.741
lock,

88
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:32.741
we talk about this commitment to unit two principles of scientific certainty.

89
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.290
Um,
Burke has,
rather than a theory,

90
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.640
he has an attitude or a disposition and outlook.

91
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.800
Um,
and that outlook is,

92
00:06:43.801 --> 00:06:48.801
it is informed at first and foremost by extreme distrust,

93
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.560
not only off science,
but if anybody who claims to have,

94
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.110
um,
scientific knowledge,

95
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.560
he thinks that human society is way too complicated

96
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.280
for us ever to get completely to the bottom off

97
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.090
that we're kind of,
uh,

98
00:07:13.091 --> 00:07:18.091
carried along on a wave of very complicated history that we understand only

99
00:07:20.621 --> 00:07:22.540
dimly if at all.

100
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.780
And that that's not going to change.

101
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.590
The human condition is a condition first and foremost of fumbling in the dark.

102
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.290
<v 1>Okay.</v>

103
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.350
<v 0>He says,
uh,
just to give you a flavor of this,</v>

104
00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:44.351
the science of constituting a Commonwealth or renovating it or reforming it is

105
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:50.050
like every other Eric experimental science not to be taught a priore.

106
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.950
So here you can see a complete resistance to the,

107
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.800
the logic or reasoning,
uh,

108
00:07:58.801 --> 00:08:03.440
that drove Hobbes and Locke and thinking about the structure of mathematics.

109
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:07.560
Uh,
and a system of axioms of the sword.
Bentham,
uh,

110
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.300
tried to come up with no says burn noise,

111
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:18.080
a short experience that can instruct us in that practical science because the

112
00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:21.860
real effects of moral causes are not always immediate,

113
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:27.280
but that which in the first instance is prejudicial may be excellent in its

114
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.160
remoter operation.
So when we think we see something bad,

115
00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:36.161
it might be having a good effect and it's excellence may arise even from the ill

116
00:08:36.791 --> 00:08:38.840
effects of producers at the beginning.

117
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:44.050
The reverse also happens and very plausible schemes with very pleasing

118
00:08:44.721 --> 00:08:49.721
commencements of often have often shameful and lamentable conclusions in states

119
00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:52.544
that are often,

120
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:57.580
there are often some obscure and almost late and causes things which appear at

121
00:08:57.691 --> 00:09:02.691
first view of little moment on which a very great part of its prosperity or

122
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:07.770
adversity may essentially depend.
So,

123
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:08.693
um,

124
00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:10.710
<v 1>okay,</v>

125
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:15.710
<v 0>the world is fundamentally mysterious and murky and things that look good might</v>

126
00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:26.010
have bad consequences.
Things that look bad might have good consequences.

127
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:31.250
The effects of our actions are going to be a realized in the distant future in

128
00:09:32.641 --> 00:09:37.380
ways that we can't possibly imagine.
Um,

129
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:42.000
and so that being the case,

130
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.840
the most important

131
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:53.540
characteristic of thinking about politics is caution.

132
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.490
We should be cautious.

133
00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:00.880
The science of government being they're so practical and itself and intended for

134
00:10:01.491 --> 00:10:03.050
such practical purposes,

135
00:10:03.051 --> 00:10:08.051
a matter which requires experience and even more experienced than any person can

136
00:10:08.241 --> 00:10:09.950
gain in his whole life.

137
00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

138
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.970
<v 0>However,
sagacious and observing he may be.</v>

139
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:20.400
It is with infinite caution that any man or to venture upon pulling down an

140
00:10:20.401 --> 00:10:25.401
edifice which has answered in any tolerable bulled degree for ages,

141
00:10:26.611 --> 00:10:31.611
the common purposes of society or on building it up again without having models

142
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and patterns of approved utility before his eyes.

143
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:45.710
So what they did in the French Revolution was the antithesis of what Burke

144
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.760
recommends because they swept everything away and decided to build again.

145
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:54.780
Tabula Rasa.

146
00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.180
Burke is deeply suspicious of all attempts to do that,

147
00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:04.110
and he thinks they'll end in disaster.
Um,

148
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.850
because the people who undertake them will not know what they're doing and even

149
00:11:08.851 --> 00:11:12.660
more dangerous.
They're not smart enough to know how dumb they are.

150
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:17.870
They're not smart enough to realize that they really do not know what they're

151
00:11:17.911 --> 00:11:18.361
doing.

152
00:11:18.361 --> 00:11:22.950
They're not smart enough to understand that they will unleash forces which they

153
00:11:22.951 --> 00:11:25.500
will not be able to control.

154
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:28.680
So Burke is in that sense,

155
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:33.710
a conservative who thinks about social change in a very cautious and incremental

156
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.133
way.

157
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:42.210
He's not a reactionary in the sense of being someone who's opposed to all

158
00:11:42.211 --> 00:11:47.070
change.
He's a conservative,
right?
One of the,

159
00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:52.071
I think one of the nice definitions of conservatism in Berks sense was actually

160
00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:57.111
put forward by Sir Robert Peel in the 19th century when he said he defined

161
00:11:58.901 --> 00:12:03.901
conservatism as changing what you have to in order to conserve what you can,

162
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.310
changing what you have to in order to conserve what you can as distinct from a

163
00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:10.720
reactionary view,

164
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.980
which could be just flat resistance to all change.

165
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.220
Um,
now,
uh,

166
00:12:18.221 --> 00:12:23.221
of course this idea of conservatism as valuing tradition is very different from

167
00:12:26.291 --> 00:12:30.980
the libertarian conservatism of Robert Nozick that we looked at,
uh,

168
00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:34.420
uh,
Olia in the course.
Um,
the,

169
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:39.600
the libertarian conservatism of Robert Nozick is anti-statist antigovernment and

170
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.620
resistance to authority being imposed on you.

171
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.160
And it's the notion of libertarian conservatism.

172
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.160
Burke is a traditionalist conservative.

173
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:57.270
He thinks that tradition is the core of human experience.

174
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:05.070
And he thinks whatever wisdom we have about politics is embedded in the

175
00:13:05.981 --> 00:13:10.900
traditions that we have inherited.
They have served us over centuries.

176
00:13:10.901 --> 00:13:14.230
This is his view,
writing at the end of the 18th century.

177
00:13:14.231 --> 00:13:18.790
They have served us for centuries.
They have evolved in a glazed steel way.

178
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.860
As I said,
people make accommodations to,
uh,
change,

179
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.510
but only in order to conserve the inherited system of norms,

180
00:13:28.511 --> 00:13:29.171
practices,

181
00:13:29.171 --> 00:13:33.610
and beliefs and institutions that we reproduce going forward.

182
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:38.910
So that's the sense in which it's a conservative tradition to conserve the basic

183
00:13:39.311 --> 00:13:43.000
meaning of the word conserv conservative.
Okay.

184
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:48.270
And so science is a really bad idea when applied to political and social

185
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:55.860
arrangements because there isn't scientific knowledge and anybody who claims to

186
00:13:57.191 --> 00:14:00.970
have it is either a Charlotte chain or a fool

187
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:07.330
habs both.
Um,
and so that's his,
as I said,

188
00:14:07.331 --> 00:14:11.830
he doesn't have a theory because he's skeptical of the very possibility of

189
00:14:11.831 --> 00:14:16.330
having a theory.
He thinks,
um,
we should,

190
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:19.700
we should,
as Clint Eastwood says,
Ah,

191
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:23.170
I've forgotten in which movie it is.
I think a fistful of dollars,

192
00:14:23.171 --> 00:14:27.040
maybe a man's got to know his limitations,

193
00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:32.380
right?
Are you feeling lucky?
A man's got to know his limitations.

194
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.790
Um,
Burke thinks that in spades.

195
00:14:36.791 --> 00:14:40.770
He thinks we have to understand that our,

196
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:45.830
our grasp of the human condition is very limited and it's gonna stay that way.

197
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:53.970
So on the first about two prongs of the enlightenment and Devaa,

198
00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:00.020
he's completely out of sympathy.
Now what about the second,

199
00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:05.021
what about the commitment to this idea of the importance of individual rights?

200
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.700
We saw how this developed in initially in locks formulation,

201
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:11.893
um,

202
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:16.930
in a theological way when lock argued that God created us with the capacity

203
00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:23.600
behave in a godlike fashion in the world.
Each individual,

204
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:23.961
uh,

205
00:15:23.961 --> 00:15:28.961
is the bearer of the capacity to create things and therefore have rights over

206
00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:34.610
his or her own creation.
In Locke's view,

207
00:15:34.611 --> 00:15:37.580
we're all equal.
We're equal in God's sight.

208
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:42.380
He creates us all equally and,
um,
we're all,
uh,

209
00:15:42.381 --> 00:15:44.360
also equal in a sense,

210
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:49.390
very important for lock that no earthly power has the authority to tell us what

211
00:15:50.571 --> 00:15:51.590
the scripture says.

212
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:56.680
Each person must do it for themselves and when they disagree and they have to

213
00:15:57.651 --> 00:16:01.820
either find a mechanism to manage their disagreement,
um,

214
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:07.030
or if they can't look for their reward in the next life,

215
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:12.170
but basically each individual is sovereign over themself.

216
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:16.790
And,
uh,
that's where modern doctrines of individual rights come from.

217
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.380
We saw how that played out with the workmanship ideal.
Uh,

218
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.980
the mill's harm principle,
um,

219
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.220
all the way down through Nozick and Rawls.

220
00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:33.830
Bentham has,
I'm sorry,
Burke has a very,

221
00:16:33.831 --> 00:16:38.390
very different view of the idea of rights.
They are,

222
00:16:38.391 --> 00:16:40.820
first of all,
they are inherited.

223
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.630
They're not the product of reason or,
um,

224
00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:48.320
any contrived theoretical formulations.

225
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:53.170
They're inherited.
You want to observe that from revolutions,

226
00:16:53.171 --> 00:16:57.500
society,
from that,
from revolution society to the Magna Carta.

227
00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:02.720
It has been the uniform policy of our constitution to claim and assert our

228
00:17:02.721 --> 00:17:07.721
liberties as an entailed inheritance do derive to us from our forefathers and to

229
00:17:09.711 --> 00:17:14.711
be true can submit it to posterity as an estate specially belonging to the

230
00:17:15.291 --> 00:17:20.291
people of this kingdom without any reference whatsoever to any other more

231
00:17:20.811 --> 00:17:22.220
general or prior.

232
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:27.310
Right by this means our constitution preserves a unity in so great at diversity

233
00:17:28.311 --> 00:17:29.270
of its parts.

234
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:34.400
We have an inheritable crown and inheritable peerage and a House of Commons and

235
00:17:34.401 --> 00:17:36.590
a people inheriting privileges,

236
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:41.740
franchise and liberties from a long line of ancestors.

237
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.580
So what we think of,
uh,

238
00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.160
when we talk about rights for Burke,
first of all,

239
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.160
they're not human rights or natural rights for him.

240
00:17:53.161 --> 00:17:55.560
They are the rights of Englishman.

241
00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.850
They're the rights of Englishmen.

242
00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:04.740
They are particular rights that the result of a particular tradition,

243
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.360
the idea that that could be universal rights doesn't make any sense.

244
00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.920
It's not an intelligible,

245
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:16.070
it's not an intelligible question as far as Burke is concerned to us,

246
00:18:16.561 --> 00:18:21.390
say what roles would say,
what rights would we create for all people,

247
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:26.340
um,
uh,
in some abstract,
uh,
setting,

248
00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.290
it doesn't make any sense to him.

249
00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:33.291
So it's the rights of Englishman and indeed when Burke Burke was sympathetic to

250
00:18:34.111 --> 00:18:36.870
the American revolution,
not the French revolution,

251
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:42.080
it was because he thought that the rights of the American colonists as an

252
00:18:43.511 --> 00:18:46.950
Englishman were being violated by the English crown.

253
00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:52.250
And he was also a sympathetic to a home claims for home rule for Ireland.

254
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:57.030
Again,
on the same sort of basis,
but it's,

255
00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:01.260
it's this entailed inheritance,
what we have,
um,

256
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:06.350
being born into as a system of rights and obligations that we reproduce into the

257
00:19:10.281 --> 00:19:15.110
future.
And they,
those rights above all are limited

258
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.710
again,
just as how knowledge of the world is limited.

259
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:24.390
So our rights in a normative sense are limited.

260
00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:29.840
Governments is a contrivance of human wisdom to provide for human wants.

261
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.960
Men have a right that these ones should be provided for by this wisdom among

262
00:19:37.171 --> 00:19:42.171
these once is to be reckoned the want out of civil society have a sufficient

263
00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:43.140
restraint.

264
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:44.830
<v 1>Okay.</v>

265
00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:48.220
<v 0>It's sufficient restraint upon their passions.</v>

266
00:19:48.221 --> 00:19:50.620
We have a right to be restrained,

267
00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:52.600
<v 1>okay.</v>

268
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:57.370
<v 0>Right.
And very different notion than a right to create things of a which we have</v>

269
00:19:57.371 --> 00:19:59.470
authority or right to be restrained.

270
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:05.140
Society requires not only that the passions of individuals should be subjected,

271
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.700
but that even in the mass and body as well as the individuals,

272
00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.420
the inclinations of man should frequently be thwarted.

273
00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:17.950
They're well controlled and their passions brought into subjection.

274
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.823
This can be,

275
00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:25.860
can only be done by a power out of themselves and not in the exercise of its

276
00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:30.160
function subject to that will and to those passions.

277
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:31.940
<v 1>Okay.</v>

278
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:32.773
<v 0>Which it is,</v>

279
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:37.870
it's office to bridle and subdue it is this sense of the restraints on men as

280
00:20:38.841 --> 00:20:40.280
well as their liberties.

281
00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:41.290
<v 1>Okay.</v>

282
00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:42.041
<v 0>In this sense,</v>

283
00:20:42.041 --> 00:20:46.660
the restraints on men as well as their liberties are to be reckoned among their,

284
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:52.630
the restraints on man as well as their liberties are to be reckoned among their

285
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.553
rights.

286
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

287
00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:00.790
<v 0>But as the liberties and the restrictions vary with time and circumstance and</v>

288
00:21:00.791 --> 00:21:03.190
admit to infinite modifications,

289
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:07.090
they cannot be settled upon any abstract rule.

290
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:12.120
Take that John Rawls and nothing is so foolish as to discuss them upon that

291
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.570
principle.
Okay.

292
00:21:16.571 --> 00:21:21.170
So we have a right to be restrained.
We have a right,

293
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:26.770
most importantly that others are going to be restrained.
Um,

294
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:31.830
and,
and that our passion should be controlled,
uh,

295
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.000
is something that

296
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:36.463
<v 1>yeah,</v>

297
00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:40.590
<v 0>he insists is an important part of what we should think of under the general</v>

298
00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.470
heading of what it is that people have rights to.

299
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:48.240
One of the first motives to civil society in which becomes one of its

300
00:21:48.241 --> 00:21:52.830
fundamental rules is that no man should it be the judge in his own cores.

301
00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:54.293
By this,

302
00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:59.420
each person has at once divested himself of the first fundamental right of

303
00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.130
uncovering rented man.

304
00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:06.720
That is to judge for himself and to assert his own cores.

305
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.940
That's not that different from lock.
That first part,
after all,

306
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:15.950
lock talks about the state of nature as being exactly a state in which we get to

307
00:22:16.231 --> 00:22:20.700
judge in our own cores,
but for lock,
we give it up in a conditional way,

308
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.640
right?
We never lose the right to revolution.

309
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:27.210
If society doesn't protect us then,

310
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.080
and that's what he thought was triggered in 1698 books has no,

311
00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:36.720
he abdicates all right to be his own governor.
He inclusively in a great measure,

312
00:22:36.721 --> 00:22:40.170
abandons the right of self defense.
The first law of nature.

313
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:45.560
Men cannot enjoy the rights of an uncivil and a civil state together

314
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:49.420
that he may obtain justice.

315
00:22:49.421 --> 00:22:54.421
He gives up his right of determining what it is in what it is in points the most

316
00:22:56.651 --> 00:22:59.920
essential to him that he may secure some liberty.

317
00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.580
He makes a surrender and trust of the whole event.

318
00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:05.890
So he's saying,

319
00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:07.670
<v 1>yeah,</v>

320
00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:08.960
<v 0>you could do,
you know,
this,</v>

321
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:13.990
this to some extent has a hobby z and flavor that that Hobbes says,

322
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:19.130
um,
if we don't have law,
we'll have civil war.

323
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:23.300
And so we have to give up freedom to authority.

324
00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:28.110
The differences even in Hobbs this formulation,
there's ultimately the,

325
00:23:28.111 --> 00:23:32.840
the recognition that if society does not provide you with protection,

326
00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.093
uh,

327
00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:39.250
you have a reasonable basis for resistance and for overthrowing it.

328
00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:44.690
But,
uh,
in Locke's case,
I mean in,
in,
in Berks case,

329
00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:49.550
uh,
he doesn't want to concede even that because we cannot,

330
00:23:49.551 --> 00:23:54.230
once we've made the transition into civil society,

331
00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:58.910
we cannot go bad back.
There's no turning back.
We're,

332
00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.470
we are,
uh,

333
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:04.580
part and parcel of this system of entailed inheritances.

334
00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:08.840
And that is the human condition all the way to the bottom.

335
00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:10.310
Um,

336
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:15.310
he doesn't reject completely the metaphor of the social contract,

337
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:19.670
but he makes it indissoluble.
He says,

338
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.630
society is indeed a contract.

339
00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.520
Subordinate contracts for or objects of mirror,

340
00:24:28.521 --> 00:24:32.210
occasional interest may be dissolved at pleasure.

341
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.300
If I make an agreement with you have to do something,

342
00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.210
we can agree to dissolve our agreement,

343
00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:44.210
but the state ought not to be considered as nothing better than a partnership

344
00:24:44.211 --> 00:24:46.970
agreement in a trade of pepper and coffee,

345
00:24:46.971 --> 00:24:51.971
Calico or tobacco or some other such law concern to be taken up for a little

346
00:24:53.361 --> 00:24:58.160
temporary interest and to be dissolved by the fancy of the parties.

347
00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.760
It is to be looked on with other reverence.

348
00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.680
It here's the state is to be looked on with other reverence because,

349
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:11.710
because it is a not a partnership in things subservient only to the gross animal

350
00:25:13.191 --> 00:25:17.090
existence of a temporary and perishable nature.

351
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:21.920
It is a partnership in all science,
a partnership in know art,

352
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:26.120
a partnership in every virtue and in all perfection.

353
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:32.590
As the ends of such a partnership cannot be entertained in many generations.

354
00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.870
It becomes a partnership.
Now,

355
00:25:35.871 --> 00:25:38.630
this is the most famous sentence Burke ever wrote.

356
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:42.200
It becomes a partnership not only between those who are living,

357
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:47.830
but between those who are living those who are dead and those who are yet to be

358
00:25:48.831 --> 00:25:52.550
born very different idea of the social contract,
right?

359
00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.920
Partnership between those who are living,

360
00:25:54.921 --> 00:25:58.340
those who are dead and those who are yet to be born.

361
00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:03.530
Each contract of each particular state is button a clause in the general

362
00:26:03.531 --> 00:26:06.950
primeval contract.
I'll be Turnell society.

363
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:10.940
So the law is not subject to the will of those.

364
00:26:10.941 --> 00:26:13.880
This is the flat rejection of workmanship,
right?

365
00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:17.500
The law is not subject to will have those who,

366
00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:22.430
who by an obligation above them and infinitely superior bound to submit their

367
00:26:22.431 --> 00:26:23.730
well to that lore.

368
00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:29.410
The munitions municipal corporations of that universal kingdom are not morally

369
00:26:30.231 --> 00:26:31.220
at liberty,

370
00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:36.340
at their pleasure and on the speculations have a contingent improvement holy to

371
00:26:37.041 --> 00:26:42.041
separate and set a under the bonds of their subordinate community and to

372
00:26:42.291 --> 00:26:45.870
dissolve it into an unsocial uncivil,

373
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:50.460
unconnected chaos of elementary principals.

374
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:52.710
So

375
00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:58.490
one way of just driving home the,

376
00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:03.550
the radical break here between his thought and the social contract theorists is,

377
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:05.813
um,

378
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:10.790
to mention that one of the standard criticisms that often gets made if social

379
00:27:10.791 --> 00:27:15.290
contract theory is,
well,
even if there was a social contract,

380
00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:16.813
you know,

381
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:21.470
some people think of the adoption of the American constitution as a kind of

382
00:27:21.471 --> 00:27:26.420
social contract after all,
it was ratified by the states.
Actually,

383
00:27:26.421 --> 00:27:30.110
the articles of confederation had said it had to be unanimous,

384
00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.350
unanimously ratified and they,
they couldn't get that.

385
00:27:33.351 --> 00:27:38.210
So they changed it to three quarters of the confederacy states.

386
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:43.070
Still there was an agreement of some sort and it was ratified and so on.

387
00:27:43.071 --> 00:27:47.060
But people often said,
have often said,
well,
so what?

388
00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:52.520
So those people and the an 18th century made an agreement.
I didn't,

389
00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:54.620
what does that got to do with me?

390
00:27:54.621 --> 00:27:58.550
Why should it be binding on subsequent generations?

391
00:27:58.551 --> 00:28:02.900
And that's often been a critique of the idea of the social contract.

392
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:08.480
Berk turns that reasoning on its head,
right?
He's,
he says,

393
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:13.870
once we see that this social contract is multigenerational between the,

394
00:28:14.751 --> 00:28:17.600
the,
the dead,
the living and those who are yet to be born,

395
00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:22.940
who are you any given individual?

396
00:28:22.941 --> 00:28:26.660
Who are you to think that you cannot spend it?

397
00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.270
What gives you the right

398
00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:34.910
to pull the rug out from under this,

399
00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:39.410
this century's old evolving social contract?

400
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:40.580
Um,

401
00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:44.750
what gives you the right to take it away from those who haven't even been born

402
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:47.880
who are part of this?
It turned off,
uh,

403
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:51.870
eternally even uses the word eternal.
Um,

404
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.930
this a terminally reproducing a social contract.
So it's,

405
00:28:55.970 --> 00:29:00.170
it's a sort of mirror image of the critique which says,
well,

406
00:29:00.171 --> 00:29:05.080
we never made it,
so why should we buy be bound by it?
He says,
ah,
it pre,

407
00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:10.090
it preexisted you and you're going to pre decease it and you don't have the

408
00:29:10.131 --> 00:29:10.760
right,

409
00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:15.760
you don't have the authority to undermine it because any rights you thank you

410
00:29:17.301 --> 00:29:22.301
have are the product of this evolving contract that contained within it.

411
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:28.010
So society is not subordinate to the individual,

412
00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:33.140
which is the most rock bottom commitment of the workmanship idea.

413
00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:38.330
On the contrary,
the individual is subordinate to society,

414
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:43.060
right?
Obligations come before rights.

415
00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:48.840
We only get a rights as a consequence of the social arrangements.

416
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:51.543
<v 2>MMM.</v>

417
00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:57.010
<v 0>That gave us our duties as well.
So,
um,</v>

418
00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:02.220
whereas the enlightenment tradition makes the individual agent sort of moral

419
00:30:03.131 --> 00:30:08.060
center of the universe,
this,
um,

420
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:13.150
God like,
uh,
individual,
uh,
creating things over which,

421
00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:18.490
uh,
she,
oh,
he has absolute sovereign control,

422
00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.120
uh,

423
00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:24.120
is replaced by the exact mirror image of the idea of an individual subordinate

424
00:30:25.871 --> 00:30:29.860
to inherited community's traditions,
social arrangements,

425
00:30:29.861 --> 00:30:31.270
political institutions,

426
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.220
<v 2>um,
uh,</v>

427
00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:38.010
<v 0>to which he or she is ultimately beholden.</v>

428
00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.450
If there was a pre collective condition.

429
00:30:42.451 --> 00:30:46.890
It's of no relevance to us now because we can't go back to it.

430
00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:52.460
And any attempt to try look across the English Channel and see what you're going

431
00:30:53.001 --> 00:30:57.360
to get.
That is the Birkin our blog.

432
00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.830
Uh,
in a nutshell.
And it is,
as I said,
uh,

433
00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:07.970
the most fundamental critique of the enlightenment it's possible to make.

434
00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:14.100
And this,
even though the enlightenment tradition,
as we've discussed,

435
00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:19.230
the we have,
um,
studied at here was

436
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.033
<v 2>mmm.</v>

437
00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:25.840
<v 0>Unfolding in the 17th,
18th,
19th,
and 20th centuries.</v>

438
00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:29.920
This anti enlightenment undertow has always been there as well.

439
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:31.763
<v 2>MMM.</v>

440
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:36.640
<v 0>And,
uh,
you know,
you could,
not to make the metaphor do too much work,</v>

441
00:31:36.641 --> 00:31:41.641
but you can really think of every wave of advancement in enlightenment thinking

442
00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.190
I'm washing down the beach,
uh,

443
00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:50.220
and producing an undertow of resistant resistance and resentment against it.

444
00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:54.490
Uh,
both philosophically and we're going to,

445
00:31:54.491 --> 00:31:59.230
I'm going to start talking in a minute about 20th century Burkey and figures,

446
00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:03.730
uh,
but also politically,
um,
you know,

447
00:32:03.731 --> 00:32:08.680
one story about the rise of fundamentalism and jihadism and,

448
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:11.740
um,
ethnic separatism,
um,

449
00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.480
is this is all part of the,
and the political undertoe

450
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.280
<v 2>yeah.</v>

451
00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:22.280
<v 0>Against the current form that the enlightenment a political project is taking,</v>

452
00:32:23.581 --> 00:32:26.580
which is globalization,
a homogenization,

453
00:32:26.581 --> 00:32:31.581
the sort of Mcdonald's effect on the world produces this backlash against

454
00:32:32.371 --> 00:32:35.220
globalization where people affirm,
um,

455
00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:40.250
primordial lucking attachments even though they probably no such thing as a

456
00:32:40.311 --> 00:32:45.290
genuinely primordial one.
Um,
uh,
separatist,

457
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:48.530
a partial affiliations and allegiances,

458
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:53.800
connections to doctrines which deny the scientific and rational project of the

459
00:32:55.671 --> 00:32:59.450
enlightenment.
And so just as globalization has been advancing,

460
00:32:59.451 --> 00:33:03.320
we've seen a resurgence of separatist religious,

461
00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:08.270
fundamentalist,
a nationalist and other kinds of identities.

462
00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:11.660
Quite the opposite.
For example,
of what Mark's predicted,

463
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:16.700
Mark's predicted that things like nationalism,

464
00:33:16.701 --> 00:33:20.720
sectarian identifications would go away.

465
00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:25.760
Uh,
so he,
he and Lenin to,
um,

466
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.820
they thought that as,

467
00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:34.030
as the principles of capitalism diffuse themselves throughout the world,

468
00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:39.410
um,
things like national attachments would go away.
And indeed on the,

469
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.540
on the eve of the first world war,

470
00:33:41.541 --> 00:33:46.130
there was the second communist international where they basically came out and

471
00:33:46.131 --> 00:33:49.580
said to the workers of Europe,

472
00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:54.050
don't get involved in this national awards,
not in your interest.

473
00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:58.220
You have a common class interest across nations,
against

474
00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.930
the interests of employers across nations.
And of course,

475
00:34:02.931 --> 00:34:07.931
this fell on completely deaf ears in 1916 the second international pretty much

476
00:34:09.291 --> 00:34:12.950
disintegrated.
And,
and in fact,
you know,

477
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:17.980
one of the big paradoxes of the 20th century has been the,

478
00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:23.780
the persistence of things like nationalism through the first two world wars.

479
00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:30.170
And then in the,
in the last part of the 20th century,

480
00:34:30.171 --> 00:34:33.200
this resurgence of religious,
uh,

481
00:34:33.201 --> 00:34:37.850
and other forms of traditionalist attachment a that are fundamentally

482
00:34:37.851 --> 00:34:40.760
antithetical to the enlightenment project.

483
00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:46.060
So the enlightenment has always produced reaction and ditto rejection often from

484
00:34:47.061 --> 00:34:50.920
the people who don't benefit from it.
Um,

485
00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:55.460
and it's one of the ways in which I think the proponents of the enlightenment

486
00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:58.100
have always been politically naive.

487
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:03.260
They've always thought that as modernization and enlightenment diffuses itself

488
00:35:03.261 --> 00:35:05.330
throughout the world,
um,

489
00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:09.110
these kinds of primitive thinking will go away.

490
00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.140
Well,
it turns out that they don't.

491
00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:16.730
And so one of the big tasks of political science,

492
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:21.980
uh,
at the present time is to try and understand why to try and understand,

493
00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.810
uh,
what the dynamics of,
um,

494
00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:30.140
political affiliation and identity attachment really are.

495
00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:34.670
And so,
um,
that's a Berkey and agenda.

496
00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:36.471
Now,

497
00:35:36.471 --> 00:35:41.471
if you fast forward from Burke to the middle of the 20th century,

498
00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:44.250
I had you read a short piece,

499
00:35:44.251 --> 00:35:48.360
very famous and important piece by Lord Devlin,

500
00:35:48.361 --> 00:35:51.360
who was an English judge like Burke,

501
00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:55.040
someone with Irish origins.
Um,

502
00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:58.280
those some,
a certain amount of,
um,

503
00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:03.470
ethnic ambiguity in both cases that by just how much Irish and that's just how

504
00:36:03.941 --> 00:36:08.590
much English,
but we needed to attain ourselves with that in this course.
Um,

505
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:13.950
and he was commenting upon something called the Wolfenden report,

506
00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:15.570
um,

507
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:20.570
which was published in 1959 and by a commission that had been

508
00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.053
<v 2>mmm</v>

509
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:28.310
<v 0>yes,
to,</v>

510
00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:33.640
to tell the British parliament what it should do about homosexuality and

511
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:42.250
prostitution and the welfare and report had said the laws against them should be

512
00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:49.430
repealed.
They should both be legalized on the grounds.

513
00:36:49.431 --> 00:36:51.020
They didn't use these terms,
but,

514
00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:55.590
<v 2>um,
uh,</v>

515
00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:59.790
<v 0>this is the basic thought or the term we would use today on the grounds at both</v>

516
00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:03.660
homosexuality and prostitution are victimless crimes.

517
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.160
Um,

518
00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:09.930
they are to use the jargon of a owl owl course,

519
00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.780
Paredo superior exchanges.

520
00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:18.090
They have voluntary transactions among consenting adults that don't harm anybody

521
00:37:18.091 --> 00:37:19.870
else.
And,
uh,

522
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:23.590
of course this was put in a different idiom because it was the 1950s,

523
00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:27.660
but that was essentially the point.
They don't harm anybody.

524
00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:32.100
So it's just traditional prejudice,

525
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:36.660
bigotry that leads us to outlaw these things.

526
00:37:36.661 --> 00:37:37.710
And we shouldn't do it.

527
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:43.160
That was what the wolf and didn't report had said and Burkey and the core Lord

528
00:37:45.451 --> 00:37:48.180
Devlin Says No.

529
00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:53.573
<v 2>Okay.</v>

530
00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:58.520
<v 0>Anyone,
I don't know how caught up you are in the reading.
Any,
anyone who has read</v>

531
00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:03.440
Burke,
I'm sorry.
Devlin.

532
00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:07.460
Tell us why he thinks,

533
00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:14.180
yeah,
you get,
we need to get you the mind why he thinks,

534
00:38:14.181 --> 00:38:17.690
why is it that Lord Devlin thinks of it,
the back there,

535
00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:23.560
that the mere fact that there's no harm is not enough of a basis for legalizing

536
00:38:28.371 --> 00:38:30.140
homosexual prostitution.
Yeah.

537
00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:33.990
<v 3>He claims that it's not,
uh,
an an attack against the individual,</v>

538
00:38:33.991 --> 00:38:36.030
but a harm against society.
Okay.
So

539
00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:40.990
<v 0>what does that mean though?
What you say it's a harm against society.
I mean,
how,</v>

540
00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:44.580
what do you take it?
How do you unpack that in your mind?
Um,

541
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:46.080
I guess it's a,

542
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:52.690
<v 4>maybe an attack against the morals that society tends to agree to.</v>

543
00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:57.620
<v 0>Yeah.
Well,
agreed.
Let's put brackets around.
Agreed.</v>

544
00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:01.920
It's not clear what we mean by,
but certainly the morals that are there.

545
00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:07.470
Okay.
And where do they come from?
Where did those morals,
I mean,

546
00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:12.740
so we have a moral code that says homosexuality and prostitution are wrong,

547
00:39:12.781 --> 00:39:17.190
but so where does that come?
You know anyone?

548
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:19.103
Yeah.

549
00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:25.060
<v 4>Well he put a lot of weight on the basis of religion for driving ones morals.</v>

550
00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.490
Correct.
Religion.
An interesting look what he says about it.

551
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:31.000
<v 0>Religion,
he says,
uh,</v>

552
00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:34.330
moral San religions are inextricably joined.

553
00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:38.710
The moral standards generally accepted in western civilization being those

554
00:39:38.711 --> 00:39:43.390
belonging to Christianity outside Christendom.

555
00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.990
That's a 1950s words.
We don't say Kirsten dim anymore.

556
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Dewey outside Chris and them are the standards derive from other religions

557
00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:58.860
outside Christendom,
other standards derived from other religions.
In England,

558
00:39:58.861 --> 00:40:03.861
we believe in the Christian idea of marriage and therefore adopt monogamy as a

559
00:40:03.931 --> 00:40:06.030
moral principle.
Consequently,

560
00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:10.950
the Christian institution of marriage has to become the basis of family life.

561
00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:14.460
And so part of the structure of our society,

562
00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:17.700
it is there not because it is Christian.

563
00:40:17.701 --> 00:40:21.960
This comes to the point about whether we've agreed it is there not because it is

564
00:40:21.961 --> 00:40:26.280
a Christian.
It got there because it is Christian.

565
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:32.160
But it remains there because it is built into the house in which we live and

566
00:40:32.161 --> 00:40:36.120
could not be removed without bringing it down.

567
00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.060
It's there.
Not because it's Christian.

568
00:40:41.061 --> 00:40:44.510
It got there because Christian as a matter of history,

569
00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:46.730
it was a Christian civilization.

570
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.210
So we have a Christian conception of morality.

571
00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.100
But he's not saying

572
00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:56.720
it's true.

573
00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:02.140
He's not saying that Christian set of beliefs about religion is true.

574
00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:08.540
Here's no interest in,
in the question of whether or not it's true.

575
00:41:08.541 --> 00:41:13.541
He's saying here a different society might be glued together by a different

576
00:41:13.791 --> 00:41:14.624
religion,

577
00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:19.630
which would create monogamy.
Um,

578
00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:20.960
it might create polygamy

579
00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:26.870
and that would have its own history and its own system of rights and

580
00:41:26.871 --> 00:41:28.430
institutions,
uh,

581
00:41:28.431 --> 00:41:32.360
and everything that goes with that.
Right?

582
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:38.260
So
it's,

583
00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:42.730
it's conservative in a sense of affirming tradition,

584
00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:47.580
but not conservative in the sense of saying there are absolute moral values.
Um,

585
00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:52.280
neither Burke nor Devlin ventures any opinion on that subject.
And he's,

586
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:54.700
they say it's not even really important.

587
00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:58.510
Right.

588
00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:03.510
What's important is that the people and the society believe in these values.

589
00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:10.410
And if the people answer the society don't believe in some system of values as

590
00:42:11.651 --> 00:42:15.940
authoritative,
the society will fall apart.

591
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:23.050
You can't put together a society just on the basis of interest.

592
00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:32.060
It needs more.
It needs moral glue.
So,
so these,

593
00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.900
these folks,
you could say,
when I say they,

594
00:42:34.901 --> 00:42:39.901
they don't really have a theory in a sense that we've looked at theories apple

595
00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:43.460
till now in this course,
it's because you could say,
well,

596
00:42:43.461 --> 00:42:48.050
they're not political theorists.
They're really sort of sociologists,
right?

597
00:42:48.051 --> 00:42:53.051
They're really sociologists of stability is they're saying that it's necessary

598
00:42:55.521 --> 00:42:57.890
for a society to be stable,

599
00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:03.880
that it's held together by this kind of moral glue of authoritative opinion.

600
00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:10.370
Okay.
So when you say to Lord Devlin,
when he's,

601
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:15.170
when he's defending,
um,

602
00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:20.520
the outlawing of homosexual prostitution,
well,

603
00:43:20.521 --> 00:43:22.210
that's just your bigotry.

604
00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:30.160
His answer wouldn't be to deny that it's in some absolute sense,

605
00:43:31.351 --> 00:43:34.020
an irrational position.

606
00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:36.930
But he would say every society needs it's bigotry.

607
00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:40.230
Every society needs its prejudices.

608
00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:44.570
<v 1>Okay.</v>

609
00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:48.170
<v 0>And so he doesn't appeal to rationality.</v>

610
00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:49.610
<v 1>Okay.</v>

611
00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:54.340
<v 0>Buddy does appeal to what he calls reasonableness.
And what is reasonable?</v>

612
00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:55.213
This,

613
00:43:55.490 --> 00:44:00.490
it's basically the system of beliefs as he puts it of the man on the clap.

614
00:44:00.741 --> 00:44:04.550
I'm omnibus.
We might today say the woman on the a train.

615
00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:06.720
<v 1>Okay.</v>

616
00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.310
<v 0>Reading The New York Post,</v>

617
00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:16.530
right.
The,
the,
the prejudices of the average person.

618
00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:22.660
That is the basic yardstick.

619
00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:27.640
And if the average person
is appalled by

620
00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:33.060
some practices,
then they should be illegal.

621
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:35.220
And that's the beginning of the end of it.

622
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:45.890
So what about that?

623
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:51.301
You know,
and you could,

624
00:44:51.301 --> 00:44:54.990
you could fast forward with it since he talks about homosexuality and what we

625
00:44:54.991 --> 00:44:59.430
call gay rights today,
if you look at the American trajectory,

626
00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.740
1986 this came up

627
00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:03.390
<v 1>okay.</v>

628
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:07.830
<v 0>Before the Supreme Court in a case called Bowers versus Hardwick,
and,</v>

629
00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:09.390
and they essentially took,

630
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:15.920
took the Burke Devlin position that assists a state should be allowed to outlaw

631
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:22.910
homosexuality because most people find it deplorable.

632
00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:25.890
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

633
00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:29.730
<v 0>Couple of years ago,
it came back to the court and they said,
well,</v>

634
00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:35.660
mores have evolved enough since 1986 that we're going to overturn Bowers versus

635
00:45:37.291 --> 00:45:38.820
Hardwick.
Very Birkin,

636
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:43.740
very right that they're following the man on the clap,

637
00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:47.850
him omnibus.
They're following the woman on the trains,
prejudices,
beliefs,

638
00:45:47.851 --> 00:45:49.920
and values.
And that's

639
00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:51.500
<v 1>okay</v>

640
00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:52.580
<v 0>as it should be.</v>

641
00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:04.990
What about that,
how many people find this appealing?

642
00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:10.390
Only to how many people find it an appealing.

643
00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:17.960
Okay.
So we,
we,
we still have at least half fine decided,
right.

644
00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:23.030
What's unappealing about it?
Yeah.
Take,

645
00:46:23.031 --> 00:46:23.960
take the microphone.

646
00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:31.950
<v 5>According to his perspective,</v>

647
00:46:31.951 --> 00:46:34.140
we might still have a system of slavery in this country.

648
00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:39.750
<v 0>According to this perspective.
We would still have slavery in this country.
Well,</v>

649
00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:43.320
uh,
I think he wouldn't concede the point that quickly.

650
00:46:43.321 --> 00:46:47.490
He would say what I just said about Bowers versus Hardwick,
that,

651
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:49.080
uh,
if,

652
00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:53.850
if the views of the man on the clap and omnibus evolve enough,

653
00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:59.580
then we can recognize change.
Um,

654
00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:04.680
now you might want to not accept that because,
um,
what if they haven't,

655
00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:09.120
you know,
before?
Um,
yeah.
Okay.

656
00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:12.310
<v 5>You refute that.
I,
I would just say that,
uh,</v>

657
00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:17.440
our morals and our ideas of what is right and wrong are shaped by,
uh,
the,

658
00:47:17.441 --> 00:47:20.050
the systems that we were born into.
And consequently,

659
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:25.430
I feel like Burke and Devlin system ascribes like a great deal of value to the

660
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:29.980
moral conceptions at,
at the beginning of society.
And that's like almost leads us

661
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.810
<v 0>to like a system of status in terms of our morality.</v>

662
00:47:32.811 --> 00:47:37.811
Like there seems to be too much status and no ability to reevaluate given how

663
00:47:38.051 --> 00:47:41.080
our moral systems are shaped.
I think that's right.

664
00:47:41.081 --> 00:47:44.650
And we will pick up with this on,
uh,
on Monday.

665
00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:47.980
But if you think,
if,

666
00:47:47.981 --> 00:47:51.850
if you think that the basic society's structure

667
00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:57.970
is okay,
you're likely to find this doctrine appealing.

668
00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:03.070
But if you think the basic structure of the society is deeply on Jast,

669
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:07.240
then you're likely to be a fronted by this outlaw,
right?

670
00:48:07.241 --> 00:48:12.241
Because one person's reasonable morality is another person's head,

671
00:48:13.841 --> 00:48:17.590
Germany.
And we'll start with that idea next time.
