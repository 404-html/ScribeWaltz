1
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.240
Okay.
Good morning.

2
00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:07.350
We're going to make the transition today to talking about Marxism,

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.480
the second of the three enlightenment traditions that we're going to consider in

4
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:14.100
the first part of this course.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And I should warn you at the outset that I have something of a heterodox view of

6
00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:26.240
marks.
Um,
hang on.

7
00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:27.890
This seems like it's a little loud.

8
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.260
<v 0>I have something of a heterodox view of marks in that if you went and read for</v>

10
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:35.094
instance,

11
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.380
is a book by a man called Graham Dunkin called marks and male.

12
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.800
Um,
he basically,

13
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.960
his storyline is that marks and mill operate with fundamentally opposed

14
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:49.860
paradigms.

15
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.890
They have paradigms meaning foundational assumptions so that marks and mail make

16
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.370
completely,
uh,

17
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.400
incommensurable an incompatible assumptions about how the world works and the

18
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.850
political theory that can flow from those assumptions.

19
00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:11.630
And so to some extent they are,
uh,

20
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.390
he thinks on all the big questions speaking past one another that,

21
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:17.310
that basically,
um,

22
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.610
<v 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.010
<v 0>you can adjudicate if you like,
um,</v>

24
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.990
the disagreements between them in part because he thinks they speaking from

25
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.950
fundamentally opposed paradigms,
I think that you couldn't be more wrong headed.

26
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.930
Marks and mail are creatures of the enlightenment both.

27
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.440
And therefore we will find in a,

28
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.470
we in examining marks that just like all of the Utilitarians we've already

29
00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:47.630
considered so far,
um,

30
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.290
that both committed to basing politics on a scientific theory of Human

31
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.110
Association and two,

32
00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.140
in committing themselves to individual freedom as the basic and most important

33
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.920
principle of politics.
If,

34
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.190
if you guys want to talk you can you do it somewhere else cause it's really

35
00:02:10.191 --> 00:02:11.024
distracting.

36
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.410
<v 1>Okay.
Thanks.
Um,</v>

37
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.400
<v 0>now,
so let's,</v>

38
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.320
before we get into the details of Marx's own argument,

39
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.730
um,

40
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.890
let's say a few general things about marks as an enlightenment thinker.

41
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.510
And if we think about the enlightenment think is,
first of all,

42
00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:35.520
as committed to science,

43
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.910
there's no question that Marx was committed to a scientific theory of politics.

44
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.280
If you read his,

45
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.050
his attack on prude horn and the Utopian socialists for example,

46
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.430
it was all about attacking them for,
um,

47
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.500
being unscientific in there thinking it was all about a rejecting sentimentalism

48
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.670
or wishful thinking,
uh,

49
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.150
and trying to understand what was feasible and what was not feasible in

50
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.810
politics.
So Mark's has a scientific conception.
Of course it is.

51
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.150
It's,
it's not,

52
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:17.310
doesn't come within a country mile of the scientific conceptions.

53
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.320
We saw both among early enlightenment theorists like bent them or mature

54
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:26.740
enlightenment theorists like male,
uh,
rather,

55
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.790
Mark's is committed to something called the materialist conception of history.

56
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.190
And the materialist conception of history is the idea that,

57
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.270
um,
I,
to use another one of his,
his,
uh,

58
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.900
rear,
the impenetrable raises,

59
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.520
he's considered committed to the idea of dialectical materialism.

60
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.780
And you might say,
well,
what is dialectical materialism?

61
00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.440
This comes from the idea first articulated by a German philosopher called Hagle

62
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.080
that history moves into kind of zigzag,
fits and starts,
um,

63
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:11.000
the dialectical ideas that um,

64
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.480
some change gets made,
some innovation gets made.

65
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.360
This though breeds a kind of undertow,

66
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.420
a resistance against the change,
the first change.

67
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.150
And then you get,
uh,

68
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.130
as a result of the initial change,
the undertow,
the kind of pushback,

69
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.270
but which isn't the same as a push back to where you started from.

70
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.680
You get a new starting point.
So Hey,
goes famous terms with thesis,

71
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.840
antithesis and synthesis.

72
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.780
The thesis is a a change.

73
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.190
So you get say the transition from um,

74
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.060
serfdom to a market based society,

75
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.570
then you get resistance to that market space.
Society,

76
00:04:58.571 --> 00:05:02.170
you would get a new working class comes into being let's say,

77
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.560
and then that working class becomes the agent of a new change that will produce

78
00:05:09.401 --> 00:05:12.070
its own antithesis in new sentences.

79
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.770
So history goes like this if you like,

80
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.340
it doesn't go in a straight line but it goes in a direction,

81
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.950
it goes forward in some sense.

82
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.880
And Hegel's idea had been that the,

83
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.590
that history eventually reaches an ending point and he thought the ending point

84
00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:32.260
was the Prussian state of his day.

85
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.950
He thought all of history was the evolving toward this,

86
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.420
this supreme highest point of the Prussian state of his day.

87
00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:44.440
And it was guided by the working out of ideas in history.

88
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.520
Mark's turns this on his head,
on it's head,
I should say,

89
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:53.470
not on his hand marks,
turns it on its head saying,
well,

90
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.390
um,
yes,

91
00:05:55.391 --> 00:06:00.140
history goes in this kind of zigzag direction of thesis,
antithesis,

92
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:04.820
synthesis,
thesis,
and then the synthesis becomes the new thesis.
And so on.

93
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.770
And yes,
it has an end point,

94
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:10.160
which is he thinks as a communist utopia,

95
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.650
but it's not driven by ideas.

96
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.430
It's not driven by ideas at all.
Instead,

97
00:06:16.431 --> 00:06:18.950
it's driven by material interests.

98
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.210
So that's why mark has view is sometimes called,
as I said,

99
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.370
dialectical materialism.

100
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.660
It's driven by material interests.

101
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.790
Or as Bill Clinton would have put it in the end,

102
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.190
it is the Bill Clinton did put it in the 1992 campaign.

103
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.290
It's the economy stupid.
It's the economy stupid.

104
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:45.080
That's the basic idea behind materialism,

105
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.200
that ideas,
um,
culture,

106
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.890
beliefs,

107
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.510
all of that stuff is what Mark's referred to as super structure.

108
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.820
It's not really important.

109
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.970
What is important is the economic base.

110
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.220
So that economic interests drive everything over time.

111
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.630
And if you want to understand how a political system works,

112
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.070
you better understand the economic system.
So in this sense,

113
00:07:16.071 --> 00:07:20.750
it's a very different view than Bentham or mail or any of these folks because

114
00:07:20.751 --> 00:07:24.080
they really working in the realm of ideas,
right?
They're not,

115
00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:25.700
Hey k aliens to be sure.

116
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.530
But they think that this idea of shaping society and in terms of their

117
00:07:30.531 --> 00:07:35.531
utilitarian calculus can be used in order to reorganize things for marks.

118
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:41.540
That would be an absurd,
completely absurd agenda.

119
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.080
You have to start with the economy.
It's the economy stupid.

120
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:50.320
You have to understand what the power forces are in the economy and what the

121
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:56.951
tensions and possibilities are within the economy before you can understand

122
00:07:57.231 --> 00:08:01.160
anything else about politics.
And in that respect,

123
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.590
I think one thing you should really get stripe right away is,

124
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:10.460
um,
just what Marx thought about capitalism.

125
00:08:10.461 --> 00:08:13.490
How many people here thought marches against capitalism?

126
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.520
March was against capitalism.

127
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.360
Almost nobody march wasn't against capitalism.

128
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.190
How many think he was fighting against capitalism?

129
00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:25.270
<v 2>Okay,</v>

130
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.350
<v 0>why,
why,
why do you think he wasn't against capitalism?</v>

131
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.130
It did just let's get the mic.

132
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:33.951
<v 3>I mean,</v>

133
00:08:33.951 --> 00:08:38.951
he wasn't against capitalism because capitalism was a necessary step in,

134
00:08:39.671 --> 00:08:41.570
uh,
in getting to socialism.
So

135
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:47.530
<v 0>you're exactly right.
So what Marx thought about capitalism wise,</v>

136
00:08:47.531 --> 00:08:51.670
and we're going to understand the reasons for this in detail in the next couple

137
00:08:51.671 --> 00:08:56.580
of lectures that for a certain phase of history,
it essential.

138
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:01.850
It was the most,
he thought capitalism was the most innovative dynamic,
um,

139
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.030
productive mode of production that had ever been dreamed up.

140
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:11.360
And there was no way you could even think about as socialist or communist

141
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:17.001
society developing unless you had capitalism first and in this and smarts would

142
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:20.940
have had absolutely no sympathy for the Russian revolution,

143
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:23.880
which was done in a peasant society,
um,

144
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:28.750
or Ma or the Chinese Communist system.
Uh,
either,
um,

145
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.030
he would have said that they were completely premature because in the end it's

146
00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:37.890
going to be capitalism which is necessary to generate the wherewithal to make

147
00:09:37.891 --> 00:09:39.840
socialism possible.

148
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:44.670
So he wouldn't have had any sympathy with the Leninist or stolen as projects,

149
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:49.290
which we'll talk about later so that he is not against capitalism.

150
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:54.210
What he thinks about capitalism is that it's sawing off the branch.

151
00:09:54.211 --> 00:09:56.040
It's sitting on over time.

152
00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:01.370
That is to say there are basic contradictions within the way capitalism works

153
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.980
and indeed the very things that make capitalism the most productive mode of

154
00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:12.960
production ever to existed in human history at one point,

155
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:13.973
those very,

156
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.680
very same dynamics ultimately will undermine it.
Um,

157
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:20.640
so he,

158
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.080
so in that sense don't think of a medicine as simply against capitalism.

159
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:30.350
He rather wants to understand the dynamics process that brings capitalism into

160
00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:31.350
being,

161
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:36.350
leads it to maturity and eventually leads it to self destruct and that that is

162
00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:40.830
the story that he's going to tell us.
So he has a scientific theory.

163
00:10:40.831 --> 00:10:44.610
It's a materialist theory.
Um,
and it's,

164
00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:48.790
it's based on this metaphor of the base and super structure.

165
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.970
Um,
people have come up with other metaphors,
skeleton and flash and so on,

166
00:10:53.971 --> 00:10:56.820
but the,
that you can play with them.
But the,
the,

167
00:10:56.821 --> 00:10:59.300
the core idea is that it's,

168
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:03.660
it's the material relations that shape everything else.

169
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:10.280
More controversially though from people might say is to say,

170
00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:15.270
well,
Marxists really a believer in individual rights and freedoms.

171
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:20.640
Most people say what marks a believer in individual rights.

172
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.790
And Mark's thinking that freedom is important.

173
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.150
Most people say no marks is an egalitarian.

174
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.880
Mark's is all about equality.

175
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:35.550
And one of the things I'm going to suggest to you in my exposition of marks is

176
00:11:35.551 --> 00:11:37.500
that that is,
um,

177
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:42.560
basically wrongheaded you'll see that when we come to talk about his idea of a

178
00:11:42.991 --> 00:11:44.490
communist utopia,

179
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:50.090
one of his bumper stickers for that is the notion that the claim that the free

180
00:11:50.551 --> 00:11:55.551
development of each is a condition for the free development of wall.

181
00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.080
The free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.

182
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.810
So he's an egalitarian in the sense that yes,

183
00:12:04.811 --> 00:12:09.811
he wants everybody to have freedom and he thinks that that is denied to many

184
00:12:10.211 --> 00:12:13.870
people in,
in most forms of social organization.

185
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:18.100
But freedom is the most important value nonetheless.

186
00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:22.750
And he wants to assured for everybody.
Um,

187
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:27.850
and related to that,
you'll see when we come to talk about,
uh,

188
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.780
nay on Wednesday or next Monday,
the labor theory of value,

189
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.320
that the basic thing that drives marks is a theory of alienation from our true

190
00:12:40.031 --> 00:12:40.541
selves.

191
00:12:40.541 --> 00:12:45.541
We can't be free unless we're at one without true selves.

192
00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:51.420
And every system of social organization before communism in his view,

193
00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:56.410
makes it impossible for us to be at one without true selves.

194
00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:01.610
We are alienated from our true natures as productive creatures by the way in

195
00:13:03.401 --> 00:13:07.570
which society is organized.
And that's the basic problem.

196
00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:12.780
So we had denied our capacity for free action according to Marx,

197
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.120
and he thinks we can never realize it until we reach this communist utopia.

198
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.240
So the,
the,

199
00:13:21.241 --> 00:13:26.241
the takeaway point is going to be that Marx is an enlightenment theorist.

200
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:31.300
Par exsalonce passe.
People like Duncan.
Um,

201
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:36.330
it's simply not correct to see him as doing something fundamentally different

202
00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.450
than the real enlightenment thinkers such as mill and Bentham.

203
00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.500
Mark's isn't enlightenment thinker.

204
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.680
And when you want to see radical critiques of the enlightenment,

205
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.120
you have to go to people like Burke and other,
uh,

206
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:57.150
anti enlightenment thinkers who were going to be getting two after spring break.

207
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:05.360
The second point related to Mark's and individual rights and freedoms is,

208
00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:10.650
is you're going to see that we're going to go back to our discussion of lock and

209
00:14:12.191 --> 00:14:16.900
you're going to discover that marks is a true Lockian believer and the

210
00:14:16.901 --> 00:14:20.920
workmanship ideal,
not in his theory of science,

211
00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.310
but in his theory of rights and entitlements,

212
00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:29.200
Marxists going to embrace a kind of doctrine of self ownership.

213
00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.510
And the idea that we make,

214
00:14:31.511 --> 00:14:36.511
we own what we make as the basis for his theory of exploitation because his

215
00:14:37.811 --> 00:14:42.811
theory of exploitation is gonna turn on the claim that people are in fact denied

216
00:14:44.621 --> 00:14:49.621
the fruits of their own labor because of the way that the system is set up.

217
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:53.420
Well,
you could say,
so why,

218
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:56.840
why should we care that people are designed,

219
00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:01.280
did deny the fruits of their own labor unless they're entitled to the fruits of

220
00:15:01.281 --> 00:15:04.910
their own neighbor.
And indeed that is Marx's view.

221
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:09.480
So you will see that in it may be I was once accused of,

222
00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.580
uh,
belittling marks by calling him a,
a minor posts.

223
00:15:13.581 --> 00:15:15.380
Lockian um,

224
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.730
but with respect to the labor theory of value and you will see that the main

225
00:15:19.731 --> 00:15:24.731
conceptual ideas that that go into it are straight out of lock second treaties

226
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.690
and it's straight out of the workmanship ideal.

227
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:34.940
What Marx is going to try and do when we get to the labor theory of value is

228
00:15:34.941 --> 00:15:38.480
give a secular version of the workmanship ideal.

229
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:43.900
And indeed developing a viable secular version of the workmanship ideal is,

230
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:49.600
is a project with as at least as long a history as the history of utilitarianism

231
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:55.810
and at least as fraught with difficulties as the history of utilitarianism.

232
00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:01.330
And we will see when we get to roles even more radical attempts than Mark's,

233
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:01.941
uh,

234
00:16:01.941 --> 00:16:06.941
to develop secular version of the labor theory of value in the workmanship model

235
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.920
and the difficulties it runs into.

236
00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:15.470
But so Mark's we'll see is the first in a long line of people who try to

237
00:16:15.471 --> 00:16:20.471
secularize the workmanship ideal by creating this labor theory of value,

238
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:25.820
um,
that's going to have,
are a rather checkered future,
um,

239
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:30.740
as we explore it into the 20th century.
And so that's where we had ink.

240
00:16:30.741 --> 00:16:34.640
We're going to explore marks as an enlightenment thinker with,

241
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.580
uh,
by means of three lectures.

242
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And the first one is going to deal with the marks and the challenge of classical

243
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:49.430
political economy.
Now,
why do I say that?

244
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:53.390
Because really there are two Marx's,
if you,

245
00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:58.310
if you were taking a course in the history of ideas that had more than three

246
00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.780
lectures on marks,

247
00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:05.140
what you would discover is a lot of attention to his German roots.

248
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:10.610
I've already mentioned that he was a disciple and critic of Hagle,

249
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:14.270
the German idealist,
philosopher,
um,

250
00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:19.420
but much of his writing until the mid 19th century was inspired by his critique

251
00:17:21.051 --> 00:17:21.351
of,
Hey,

252
00:17:21.351 --> 00:17:25.850
goes other followers and disciples and we're pretty much not going to deal with

253
00:17:25.851 --> 00:17:26.684
that.

254
00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:31.430
We're not going to deal with the German marks when not by and large going to

255
00:17:31.431 --> 00:17:34.280
deal with the young Marx Rather.
What,

256
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:39.310
what happened to him was he Marx thought you may or may not know this,

257
00:17:39.621 --> 00:17:43.190
but in 1830s,
there were revolutions across Europe.

258
00:17:43.191 --> 00:17:45.590
Kings and Queens were,
uh,

259
00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:50.650
kicked out of office and democracy came to power and what marks and many of

260
00:17:50.971 --> 00:17:54.510
those around him thought this is the beginning of the end of capitalism.

261
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:59.100
By 1830 to 1833,

262
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:03.540
all of those democratic revolutions had failed and the Monica is,

263
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:06.690
had been restored across Europe.
But then

264
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.530
in 1848,

265
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.370
there was another whole series of revolutions across Europe.

266
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:15.570
And once again,

267
00:18:15.571 --> 00:18:20.571
Marx thought maybe this is the beginning of the end and had great faith and

268
00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:25.890
optimism that that was going to be the case.
But by 1851,
uh,

269
00:18:25.891 --> 00:18:30.891
those revolutions had all again failed and the mechanics were back in power and

270
00:18:32.191 --> 00:18:37.191
marks after that became steadily more dejected and steadily more skeptical over

271
00:18:39.631 --> 00:18:44.580
his remaining years that in fact he was going to see a communist revolution in

272
00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:49.560
his lifetime and rather he invested in,

273
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:50.563
um,

274
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.130
the project of trying to understand capitalism in a much more systematic way

275
00:18:56.131 --> 00:19:00.810
than he had done in his youth.
He was also,
he was kicked out of Germany.

276
00:19:00.811 --> 00:19:05.100
He couldn't go to France and he wound up in London and he lived the second,

277
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.670
the last decades of his life in London.
Um,

278
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:13.500
and in fact died and was buried there.
If you,
if you ever in London,

279
00:19:13.501 --> 00:19:15.600
you can go up to um,

280
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:20.130
Highgate cemetery on the northern line.
It's a very interesting cemetery.

281
00:19:20.131 --> 00:19:24.270
They all kinds of interesting people.
They had George Elliot is there.
Anyway,

282
00:19:24.271 --> 00:19:27.750
there is Karl Marx in Highgate cemetery.

283
00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:30.480
It's all overgrown and very.
Anyway,

284
00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:35.780
he spent his last decades working in the basement of the British Museum and

285
00:19:36.271 --> 00:19:40.670
that's where he composed his magnum opus is three volume work,

286
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.970
Dusk Kapa Tolle.

287
00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:47.450
It was actually envisaged as a 12 volume work and the only volume that was

288
00:19:49.831 --> 00:19:53.770
published in his lifetime was actually volume one.
Uh,

289
00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:58.140
the second and third volumes were put together by his friend and collaborator,

290
00:19:58.141 --> 00:20:00.570
Frederick Engels.
Um,

291
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:05.640
and unfortunately for us the volumes about politics,

292
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.360
uh,
whenever written.

293
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:12.740
So you have to some extent to put together his views of his mature views about

294
00:20:12.931 --> 00:20:17.931
politics from a scrap see road here and there and some of the,

295
00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:23.430
um,
short pieces about politics that do appear in the,

296
00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:26.370
in the Oli volumes.
Um,

297
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.100
so we're going to mostly focus on the mature marks.

298
00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:37.250
We're mostly gonna focus on Mark's as he set himself the task of understanding

299
00:20:38.971 --> 00:20:43.971
the dynamics of capitalism after he had pretty much given up on his useful

300
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.470
youthful enthusiasm for the,

301
00:20:46.471 --> 00:20:51.471
for the quick transformation the world and to socialist and communist societies,

302
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:57.600
which he basically started to shed a after 1848 with a brief revival of interest

303
00:20:59.321 --> 00:21:04.030
in 18,
17.
Jay Given events in France.
Uh,

304
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:09.060
but basically it was a trajectory and from opt youthful optimism into,

305
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:14.560
um,
mature pessimism,
at least from his point of view.

306
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:21.100
Okay.
So what he did was he said,
Tim South,
well,

307
00:21:21.101 --> 00:21:26.101
what is it that people are involved in who engage in the Syria systematic

308
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.740
analysis of capitalism.

309
00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.640
And here Mark's is,
we,
we,

310
00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:38.470
we tend to present marks as an unorthodox or radical thinker,

311
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:42.550
but in fact,
he was a very conventional thank for his day.

312
00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:48.060
That is to say Marx was a follower of Adam Smith and David Ricardo.

313
00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.100
Um,
and,

314
00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:56.101
and he saw the himself largely as tackling and refining the theorists,

315
00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:01.630
the theories that they developed.
And what I want to do with,

316
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:02.290
uh,

317
00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:06.790
the rest of our time this morning is say something about the project of

318
00:22:06.791 --> 00:22:11.791
classical political economy that Mark's inherited and contributed to and why he

319
00:22:13.091 --> 00:22:15.490
thought getting the,

320
00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:20.690
the basic problems that the classical political economists we're trying to solve

321
00:22:20.981 --> 00:22:25.981
solved would enable us to understand what the real conditions were that would

322
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.800
eventually lead to the collapse of capitalism.

323
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:37.350
The most important feature of capitalism as far as Adam Smith was concerned and

324
00:22:38.651 --> 00:22:43.030
the wealth of nations and his followers after him

325
00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:48.270
was the division of Labor.

326
00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.053
<v 2>Okay.</v>

327
00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:55.290
<v 0>The division of Labor is really important because it has two features.</v>

328
00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.280
One,
as far as marks will be concerned,

329
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:04.510
it begins the process of alienating us from ourselves.

330
00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:06.790
Why does it do that?

331
00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:11.940
It does that because we start instead of producing things that we then consume,

332
00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:15.410
<v 2>okay.</v>

333
00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.050
<v 0>We start producing things in a,</v>

334
00:23:18.051 --> 00:23:22.520
in a situation where we divide up tasks,
um,

335
00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:24.220
<v 2>okay.</v>

336
00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:28.090
<v 0>And that makes it impossible for us to live rounded lives.</v>

337
00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.090
That's ultimately where it's going to go.
But second and much,

338
00:23:31.091 --> 00:23:35.920
much more important from the point of view of economics is that the division of

339
00:23:35.921 --> 00:23:39.160
Labor is the engine of productivity.

340
00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:43.390
The more you,
you're more,
you engage in the division of labor,

341
00:23:43.391 --> 00:23:47.990
the more productive you make people.
And Smith has this wonderful,
this,

342
00:23:47.991 --> 00:23:52.820
this wonderful example right near the beginning of the wealth of nations where

343
00:23:52.821 --> 00:23:57.560
he talks about a pin factory.
Smith has been going around England,

344
00:23:57.561 --> 00:23:59.030
China understand where,

345
00:23:59.031 --> 00:24:03.340
where the dynamism and the English economy is and he says he's,

346
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:07.610
he gives us description of a pin factory.
He says,
one man draws out the wire,

347
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:12.880
another straight said a third cuts it a fourth points it at fifth grinds at the

348
00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:18.050
top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct

349
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.680
operations.
To put it on it's on is a big,

350
00:24:21.681 --> 00:24:25.700
to put it on is a peculiar business.
To widen the pins is another,

351
00:24:25.701 --> 00:24:29.360
it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper.

352
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:33.200
And the important business of making a pin is in this man,

353
00:24:33.201 --> 00:24:37.310
a divided into about 18 distinct operations.

354
00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:39.830
As a result of that division of labor,

355
00:24:39.831 --> 00:24:44.831
though a Smith calculated that 10 workers could make 48,000 pins a day.

356
00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.570
But if they had all worked separately and independently,

357
00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.440
all they could have produced was a few dozen.
So that,

358
00:24:54.441 --> 00:24:57.200
that basic insight of smiths,

359
00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:02.000
that it's the division of Labor that is the engine of capitalists productivity

360
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.730
set,
set terms for his own,

361
00:25:04.731 --> 00:25:09.440
for Adam Smith's analysis of markets and the wealth of nations for Ricardo's

362
00:25:09.441 --> 00:25:14.190
refined my,
uh,
and for locks ref for hop.
I'm sorry,
mark.

363
00:25:14.191 --> 00:25:18.680
So should be fine,
man.
Of both of their arguments,
uh,
in das capital.

364
00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.020
So what were,

365
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:22.390
<v 2>okay,</v>

366
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:26.560
<v 0>what was the project of classical political economy?</v>

367
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:31.990
What was it that marks was stepping into and trying to contribute to?

368
00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:35.920
Well,
one way of describing it

369
00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:42.780
as I have it here is it was the search for theories of natural and market.

370
00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:46.680
Got Theories that twice,
sorry search.

371
00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:50.500
But there is a natural and market wages,
prices,

372
00:25:50.501 --> 00:25:51.940
rents and profits.

373
00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.590
They want it to understand what determines wages,
prices,

374
00:25:56.591 --> 00:25:57.790
rents and profits.

375
00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:02.890
But they thought you had to have a theory of natural wages,
prices,

376
00:26:02.891 --> 00:26:06.610
rents and profits and market wages,
prices,

377
00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:08.560
rents and profits.

378
00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:13.200
Now let's focus on prices because the,
the,

379
00:26:13.201 --> 00:26:18.201
the way the other three are treated is basically an by an allergy to the

380
00:26:18.251 --> 00:26:20.050
analysis of prices.

381
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:26.990
A modern neoclassical economist would say there is no natural price of anything.

382
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.750
Ahmad neoclassical economists would say,

383
00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:40.650
what determines prices is supply and demand in the market.

384
00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:44.790
There is nothing else to say about prices.

385
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:49.620
And they gave up the notion that this,

386
00:26:49.621 --> 00:26:52.590
any natural theory of wages,
prices,

387
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.690
rents and profits to be found.

388
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:59.310
So the big difference between the classical theorists and the modern theorists

389
00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.940
is this idea that there's a theory of natural prices.

390
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.860
Now why would they think there's a theory of natural prices?

391
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:13.530
The reason they thought there was a theory of natural prices was they weren't

392
00:27:13.531 --> 00:27:18.531
arguing with people like the physio Kratz and the trade theorists about where

393
00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.740
value comes from.
What is the source of value?

394
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:27.870
The physiocrats and France said the source of value is the land.

395
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:30.300
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

396
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:34.590
<v 0>That somehow it gets transferred to the products.
Where's the,</v>

397
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:39.690
the trade theorist who had been impressed that countries like Holland heads,

398
00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.130
which had so little land,

399
00:27:41.131 --> 00:27:45.270
but it comes a Rick said no value comes from trade.

400
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:48.150
So they were all sort of saying,
you know,

401
00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:49.320
<v 2>yeah.</v>

402
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.680
<v 0>Where is the [inaudible]?
What is the source of value?</v>

403
00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:56.540
And the English theorist following,
um,

404
00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.000
lock petty.
So William Petty,

405
00:28:00.001 --> 00:28:05.001
John Locke Hobbes all believed that the way you find value is to go into labor.

406
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:12.030
That work.
Workmanship is the source of value.

407
00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:15.630
So all let it class.
A couple medical economist,
Smith,

408
00:28:15.631 --> 00:28:20.631
Ricardo and Marx believed in the Labor theory of value and they count to pose

409
00:28:22.451 --> 00:28:26.670
that to theories based on trade or the physiocrats theories,

410
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:31.410
uh,
that were popular in France.
Um,
as I've said,

411
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:35.760
so that's one reason,
but another is that they didn't,

412
00:28:35.761 --> 00:28:40.761
it's not the case that they were ignorant of the laws of supply and demand.

413
00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:42.430
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

414
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:46.410
<v 0>So,
um,
and we'll see how Mark's handles them.
Uh,</v>

415
00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:47.620
on Wednesday.

416
00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:51.550
It's not the case that they're ignorant of the laws of supply and demand,

417
00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:56.560
but they thought it couldn't possibly tell you the whole story.
So,

418
00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:57.500
<v 2>okay.</v>

419
00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.410
<v 0>If you can think about it this way,</v>

420
00:28:59.411 --> 00:29:02.590
suppose there is a,

421
00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:07.470
a dearth in the supply off coffee marks,

422
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:10.400
the price will go up.

423
00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:11.630
<v 2>Okay.</v>

424
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:16.230
<v 0>They didn't disagree with that.
Right.
And if they're too many coffee mugs,</v>

425
00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:20.580
coffee mugs and anybody who wants the price will go down and I may,

426
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:25.100
maybe somebody will realize you can drill holes in the bottom there and then use

427
00:29:25.101 --> 00:29:29.800
them to grow plants in a and then maybe their price would go up a bit because

428
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:34.040
they'll be more,
but they thought that supply and demand fluctuate.

429
00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:38.120
Um,
with what it is that people actually want.

430
00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.910
They didn't have any problem with that notion,

431
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:45.930
but still in all they thought there must be something that will tell you what

432
00:29:46.421 --> 00:29:51.421
the price is when supply and demand are in equilibrium in other,

433
00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:55.720
in other way you can think about it is supply and demand go up and down,

434
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:58.540
but they go up and down around some point.

435
00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.570
I wonder what tells you what that point is.

436
00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:04.100
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

437
00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:08.060
<v 0>fit.
That's why the Labor theory about he was supposed to do,</v>

438
00:30:08.061 --> 00:30:10.100
that's the natural price.

439
00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:15.700
I think a modern economist might call it the long run equilibrium price.

440
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:18.740
That's one way in which,

441
00:30:18.741 --> 00:30:23.741
if you wanted to find an analogy in modern economic thinking to this classical

442
00:30:25.151 --> 00:30:28.820
idea of a natural price,
it's the long run equilibrium price.

443
00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:34.210
It's the price of a commodity when supply and demand rns equilibrium.

444
00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:42.310
So the Labor theory of value was the theory of that.

445
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.020
It was going to chatty you walk the long run equilibrium price of a commodity

446
00:30:47.021 --> 00:30:48.850
would be okay.

447
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:53.110
And all of the classical political economists with trying to have a theory off

448
00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:58.060
that.
Uh,
so when you read natural prices,
um,

449
00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:01.120
that's what you should think.
You know,
what,
what is,

450
00:31:01.121 --> 00:31:04.680
they're trying to understand what not marginal changes as,

451
00:31:04.681 --> 00:31:07.870
as in the sense of a parade.
Oh,
diagram.
Um,

452
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:12.900
but the long run changes given the marginal fluctuations around some point.

453
00:31:13.331 --> 00:31:16.120
The question is what is that point?
Uh,

454
00:31:16.121 --> 00:31:20.530
and that's what the Labor theory of value was designed to give you.

455
00:31:20.531 --> 00:31:23.290
It was a theory and that sense of natural prices,

456
00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:26.230
not a theory of market prices.

457
00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:30.280
They thought you have to have both supply and demand gave you the market price.

458
00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:34.480
The Labor theory of value gave you an actual price.

459
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:40.990
The second big problem that frame the project of classical political economy was

460
00:31:43.841 --> 00:31:47.140
that they all believed as they looked around them,

461
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:52.290
that there was a declining tendency in the rate of profit.

462
00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:56.280
This was taken as an as,
as a given.

463
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:58.560
<v 2>Okay.</v>

464
00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:02.850
<v 0>It's a given widely accepted empirical fact.</v>

465
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:09.110
And so if it was the case that there's the right of profit,

466
00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.450
tends to decline over time,

467
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.710
can be offset by virus things and so on,
which we will talk about.

468
00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:21.570
But if it's the case that the rate of profit in capitalist economies declines

469
00:32:21.571 --> 00:32:22.410
over time,

470
00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:26.640
your theory isn't going to be worth a damn unless you can explain why.

471
00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:31.070
So one of the tests,
if you'd like,

472
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:35.920
have a good theory as far as Smith was concerned,
is smart,

473
00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:41.020
far as Ricardo was concerned and as far as was concerned was it had to explain

474
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:47.270
the declining tendency in the rate of profit.
And Ms. Smith had an account,

475
00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:52.340
uh,
Ricardo had an account and Mark's had an account.
They all different somewhat.

476
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:55.700
They will all have overlapped in some ways.
We'll see.

477
00:32:56.090 --> 00:33:00.380
Part of the reason they think all three of them thought you would have to have

478
00:33:00.381 --> 00:33:02.680
imperialism was you,
you,

479
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:07.310
you needed new markets to offset this problem of the declining tendency and the

480
00:33:07.311 --> 00:33:12.200
rate of profit at home.
But that was only going to be a temporary stop gap,

481
00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.560
uh,
or solution.
But in any event,

482
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:18.980
your theory wasn't going to be worth anything unless it pet.

483
00:33:18.981 --> 00:33:23.720
Explain why pri prices are what they are.

484
00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:28.520
Theory of long run equilibrium prices and second,
unless

485
00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:31.880
it gave

486
00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:39.600
have a credible account of why profits fall in capitalist systems over time.

487
00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:47.100
Now a third conceptual point to make that you need in order to understand the

488
00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:53.910
project of classical political economy as Marx understood it is actually related

489
00:33:56.301 --> 00:33:57.860
to the first point,

490
00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:02.420
but I'm just singling it out because people sometimes get confused about it.

491
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:07.990
It's a distinction that Marx makes between use value and exchange value.

492
00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:14.590
Sometimes you will see Marx uses the word value with a big V.

493
00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:18.770
Okay?
You should just read that as exchange value.

494
00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:20.470
<v 2>Okay,</v>

495
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:24.880
<v 0>so value with a big V is value is exchanged value.</v>

496
00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:31.320
So what is the difference between use value and exchange value?

497
00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:36.190
Well,
from Mark's use value is you tell him

498
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:39.350
that's all it is.

499
00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.790
Use value is simply usefulness

500
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:49.460
and he has a kind of binary theory of use value.

501
00:34:49.461 --> 00:34:51.920
Either things have used value or they don't.

502
00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:55.700
So coffee cops have a use value can drink out of them.

503
00:34:55.701 --> 00:34:59.720
If somebody drilled holes in the bottom of them,
they would have no use value.

504
00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.770
Um,
tell somebody came along and said,
well,
we could use them to grow plants,

505
00:35:03.771 --> 00:35:08.450
then they would have use value.
So thanks.
Either have use value or they don't.

506
00:35:08.451 --> 00:35:11.270
And I'll come back to that in a minute.
Um,

507
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:15.470
and that's going to affect the supply and demand,

508
00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:18.890
but it's not going to explain the price.

509
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:23.270
It's not going to explain the long run equilibrium price.

510
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:25.940
That is the exchange of value.

511
00:35:25.941 --> 00:35:30.941
And that is what we learn about from the labor theory of value as far as Marx

512
00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:32.180
was concerned.

513
00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:38.110
So it's the labor theory of value explains the price and is not to be confused

514
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:45.210
with the use value or utility of an object.
Again,

515
00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:49.530
one important difference and maybe the most important difference between

516
00:35:49.531 --> 00:35:54.531
classical political economy and neoclassical political economy is we will see

517
00:35:55.891 --> 00:36:00.300
later the neoclassical people shed the labor theory of value.

518
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:05.220
And so there is no exchange value independent of utility.
Uh,

519
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.630
but we'll get to that.

520
00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:10.350
That's getting ahead of ourselves as far as you're concerned with.

521
00:36:10.351 --> 00:36:14.490
Then when you concerned with the classical formulations and in the 19th century

522
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:19.760
exchange value or price or value with the big V is determined by the Labor

523
00:36:20.941 --> 00:36:25.941
theory of value and use value is usefulness.

524
00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:31.800
And that brings me to Marxists.

525
00:36:31.801 --> 00:36:34.830
Definition of a commodity.

526
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:44.160
A commodity has a very special meaningful marks.

527
00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:49.470
It's something that is produced or exchange.

528
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.890
So if you produce,

529
00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:58.950
if you grow,
if you grow and you grow,

530
00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:02.370
you plant an apple tree in your grow apples in order to eat them,

531
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.570
you producing for consumption,
those apples are not commodities.

532
00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:11.040
But if you plant an apple tree and grow apples and sell them,

533
00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:16.730
then those apples are commodities like you put something is a commodity if it's

534
00:37:17.791 --> 00:37:20.400
produced for exchange.

535
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.570
And that's very important because once you have a division of labor,

536
00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.630
you have more and more commodity production.

537
00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:33.890
And you might recall in my very first lecture I said that one of the things mark

538
00:37:34.321 --> 00:37:39.321
shares in common with Bentham is he somebody who pushes the idea he has to the

539
00:37:40.831 --> 00:37:44.400
absolute extreme.
And then even beyond that,

540
00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:49.980
so what,
what are we going to see happen with marks?

541
00:37:49.981 --> 00:37:54.981
And commodification is exactly analogous to bent them and utility that Bentham

542
00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:57.600
says,

543
00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:02.600
how would the world look if utility maximization was the only game in town,

544
00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:07.080
if there was nothing else at all?

545
00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:10.110
And so he's theory runs with marks.

546
00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:15.650
It's how would the world look if commodification was the only game in town?

547
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:20.610
Everything in a capitalist system becomes a commodity.

548
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.300
Even the worker himself,

549
00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:26.760
even the worker himself.

550
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:31.200
And when we start to understand the dynamics of capitalist production,

551
00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:36.980
we'll see that the analysis of the value of a worker is no different than the

552
00:38:37.991 --> 00:38:42.991
analysis of the value of the pen that the workup producers in Adam Smith's

553
00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:44.493
factory.

554
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:49.710
So he takes this idea of commodification and pushes that to the health.

555
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:56.790
So I think if you think about those four features of the project,

556
00:38:57.011 --> 00:38:58.930
of classical political economy,

557
00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:04.290
it gives you a sense of what was Mark's in marks his head as he set off to try

558
00:39:05.051 --> 00:39:09.100
and understand the dynamics of capitalist systems.

559
00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:17.870
And what he did was he said,

560
00:39:17.871 --> 00:39:18.710
well,

561
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:25.620
we have to understand first of all how capitalist systems look to the

562
00:39:26.891 --> 00:39:28.060
participants

563
00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:34.740
because the way in which they look to the participants is not the same as the

564
00:39:34.871 --> 00:39:37.420
way in which they really work.

565
00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:43.330
So there's a basic distinction if you like,
between parents and reality.

566
00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:48.900
The way in which people think market systems work isn't the way in which they

567
00:39:50.471 --> 00:39:55.150
actually work.
So it's a little like Bentham saying,
you might,
you know,

568
00:39:55.151 --> 00:39:59.980
you might think you're not motivated by utility and all the rest of it,

569
00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:03.070
but in fact you are in the rack case.
We get it right.

570
00:40:03.071 --> 00:40:05.440
Not The rat case is that we get it wrong.

571
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:08.890
And this sense marks like Bentham is an objectivist.

572
00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:14.220
He thinks he's describing scientifically the laws of motion of capitalist

573
00:40:14.801 --> 00:40:16.610
systems.
Um,

574
00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:21.660
regardless of whether the participants in those systems understand these laws of

575
00:40:21.671 --> 00:40:26.590
motion.
And for the most part,
they don't.
Indeed,
he will.

576
00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:31.650
He's gonna claim ultimately that a socialist revolution differs from all others

577
00:40:32.591 --> 00:40:34.690
because for the first time in history,

578
00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:39.860
people understand the social relations that they're part of and soak

579
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:42.770
unselfconsciously transform them.
Um,

580
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.350
and create a n I'm alienated social order,

581
00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:53.250
but so he,
so he eats at the beginning of volume one of capital.

582
00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:55.090
He's basically saying,

583
00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.220
how does it look to the participants?
Well,

584
00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:05.140
if you have a division of labor,
you look around,
what do you actually see?

585
00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:08.860
You see people producing commodities.

586
00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.060
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

587
00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:16.060
<v 0>They change those commodities for money and then they use that money to buy</v>

588
00:41:16.811 --> 00:41:19.630
other commodities which they consume.

589
00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:24.700
So you have these cycles of exchange,
commodity money,
commodity.

590
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:26.350
<v 2>Okay.</v>

591
00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:30.620
<v 0>Right.
So the person working,
you know,
producing apple,</v>

592
00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.850
growing apples,

593
00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:37.060
sells the from money and then uses the money to buy milk and eggs and so on.

594
00:41:37.341 --> 00:41:41.680
And the simplest case,
right?
So that if you know,

595
00:41:41.681 --> 00:41:46.681
if someone landed from Mars in the middle of a capitalist economy,

596
00:41:47.181 --> 00:41:50.480
that's what they would see all of these people producing things,

597
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:54.590
exchanging those things from money and buying other things which they then

598
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:58.190
consume.
Right?
That was the idea.

599
00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:03.980
But then
if you look a little bit more carefully,

600
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:09.020
you'll see that actually some people are doing something entirely different.

601
00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:12.290
Most people are producing commodities,

602
00:42:12.291 --> 00:42:16.880
exchange in the commodities for money and then using the money to buy other

603
00:42:16.881 --> 00:42:18.650
commodities that they consume.

604
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:24.010
But mark says some people are doing something different that taking some money,

605
00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:31.920
buy a commodity in this case that the labor of the worker for a certain time and

606
00:42:37.661 --> 00:42:42.640
then selling what gets produced for more money so then are interested in

607
00:42:42.641 --> 00:42:47.290
consumption.
It doesn't seem at least at first sight.

608
00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:52.300
And indeed if you look even more closely,

609
00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:54.790
you'll see that when they do that

610
00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:00.970
the money they end up with is more than the money they started with.

611
00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:07.970
M prime is bigger than m

612
00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:10.950
and the question,

613
00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:16.220
the organizing question of Das copic tall and that was the question that

614
00:43:16.711 --> 00:43:21.711
preoccupied Adam Smith and David Ricardo before marks and as I said in this

615
00:43:22.081 --> 00:43:27.081
sense he was a completely orthodox classical theorists is radicalism comes in

616
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:31.380
later.
The question is where does prime come from?

617
00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:35.370
What makes profit possible?

618
00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:40.230
You're not going to explain why profits decline after all.

619
00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:43.260
If you can't understand where profits come from,

620
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.260
what is the origin of

621
00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:49.763
profit?

622
00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.730
That's the basic problem.

623
00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:01.740
The transformation of money into capital has to be developed on the basis of the

624
00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:07.420
eminent laws of the exchange of commodities in such a way that the starting

625
00:44:07.421 --> 00:44:09.790
point is the exchange of equivalence,

626
00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:15.210
the money [inaudible] who is as yet only the capitalist in larval form must by

627
00:44:16.091 --> 00:44:18.160
his commodities at that value,

628
00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:23.460
sell them at their value and yet at the end of the process withdraw more value

629
00:44:24.551 --> 00:44:28.210
from circulation.
Then he threw into it at the beginning.

630
00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:33.960
It's emergence as a butterfly mass and yet must not take place in the cert fear

631
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:39.900
of circulation.
These are the conditions of the problem.

632
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:46.190
Very famous passage at the beginning of capital telling us that if you want to

633
00:44:48.541 --> 00:44:52.650
understand why the capitalist winds up with more,

634
00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:58.750
you have to understand the source of value because it's not about,
it's not,

635
00:44:58.751 --> 00:45:03.751
there's no cheating equivalence exchange for equivalence in every one of those

636
00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:05.433
cycles.

637
00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:10.270
It's not that somehow the worker is tricked into selling his labor power for

638
00:45:10.271 --> 00:45:13.060
less than it's worth.
On the contrary,

639
00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:15.610
he's paid exactly what it's worth.

640
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:19.520
So once you can understand that puzzle,

641
00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:20.940
<v 2>okay,</v>

642
00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:24.030
<v 0>of how when equivalents exchange for equivalence,</v>

643
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:27.810
new value is still nonetheless created,

644
00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:31.800
then you understand the secret to where profit comes from.

645
00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:34.050
You know the source of value,

646
00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:39.110
and you can begin the process of understanding that dynamic productiveness of

647
00:45:39.991 --> 00:45:44.400
capitalism and why it will eventually start to fall apart.

648
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:48.030
And we will dig into those subjects on Wednesday.
