1
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.900
Okay.
Good morning.
Um,

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.100
one prefatory point before we get into today's lecture,

3
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.290
uh,
that's occasion by having you read Macintyre,

4
00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:17.850
but I ought really to have mentioned it before.
Um,

5
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.090
Mcintyre's book after virtue is in part a conversation with major figures in the

6
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:26.040
tradition,
uh,

7
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.190
who you have not read or at least not in the scores a Aquinas Niche,

8
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.370
uh,
um,
Hagle and many others.

9
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.560
And of course this came up with John Roles in that,
uh,

10
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.020
and indeed Robert Nozick,
uh,

11
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.350
both of whom depended on arguments from Emmanuel Kant that we haven't studied in

12
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:49.920
this course either.

13
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.090
And so one question that arises as well,

14
00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:57.660
to what extent are you responsible for,
uh,

15
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.690
there for understanding the people on whom they are commenting and of course

16
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:07.260
you're entering in a car into a canvas and ongoing conversation among these

17
00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:12.261
thinkers that's been going on for centuries and to some degree you just have to

18
00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:15.600
jump in somewhere.
Nonetheless,

19
00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:17.850
for the purposes of our course here,

20
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.350
you're certainly not responsible for understanding cons,
ethics,

21
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.940
and indeed we could,
I could give several lectures on why it,

22
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.520
why it is the case that con would not have agreed either with rolls,

23
00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:36.420
his interpretation of his own work or with the roles in enterprise,

24
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.120
but,
but,
um,

25
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.630
we're not really interested in con in this course,

26
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.970
but in roles in that instance.

27
00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:49.740
So to the extent he depends upon a faulty reading of cons,

28
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.720
um,
groundwork of the metaphysics of morals.

29
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.460
That's not a question with which we are engaged in this course.
Uh,

30
00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:03.240
it's not that we're taking a position about it,
we're just agnostic.

31
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.270
Likewise with the various,
uh,

32
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:10.250
think is that McEntire engages,
um,

33
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.530
you are not expected to know a saint benedict or neat show or at Aquinas or

34
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:18.180
anybody else or indeed,

35
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.770
Aristotle about whom I have quite a bit to say today.
Um,

36
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.440
except in so far as they are,
they are building blocks for Macintyre's argument.

37
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.860
So Mcintyre's work in some ways is a commentary on the history of ideas,

38
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.200
but really it's first and foremost and argument and we're interested in it as an

39
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.400
argument and that's how we're going to evaluate it.
So,
um,

40
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.430
of course it's an invitation to you later on to go into some of these thinkers

41
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.890
in depth with whom he is engaged and see where the ultimately you agree or

42
00:02:55.111 --> 00:02:59.220
disagree with the way in which he had engages those thinkers.

43
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.570
But that's not our agenda here.

44
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.930
Our agenda here is to think of Allister Mcintyre as somebody who's making an

45
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:12.091
argument in his own right and that's how we're going to engage with his work.

46
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.140
He is a political theorist who,
um,

47
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.770
currently teaches at Notre Dame.
Um,

48
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.060
interestingly,
um,

49
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.100
they say that the hand that rocks the cradle controls the person forever.

50
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.230
I,
after he started out,
uh,

51
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.910
I think he was raised in a Catholic.
Uh,

52
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.780
he had a catholic upbringing,
but early on in his career,

53
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.090
he must be well into his eighties.
Now,
early on in his Korea,

54
00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:47.290
he wrote a book called Marxism and Christianity.

55
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.520
And he was clearly wrestling with,
you know,
who wins out of out of,
uh,

56
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.190
Mark's and Christianity.

57
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.240
And in that book he concluded that Marxism One,

58
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.300
and in his early incarnations he was a fairly conventional Marxist,

59
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.620
but then gradually he came full circle,
um,

60
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.680
and ended up rejecting not only Marxism but the larger enlightenment project of

61
00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:19.171
which Marxism as you all know is only one part a and ended up affirming a kind

62
00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:24.760
of,
um,
traditional,
um,

63
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.440
mix of Aristotelian ism and the Catholic tradition.

64
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.820
Um,
that informs his argument both in after virtue.

65
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.490
And then a subsequent book,
which I'm not having you read,
uh,

66
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.100
I called who's tradition,
which rationality.

67
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.500
So he is somebody who in in an important sense has come full circle.

68
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:48.270
Um,

69
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.270
and I think that it's war that's an important piece of background to know in

70
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:57.850
understanding his work off the virtue he's written on.

71
00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.380
He's written many other books too,

72
00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:03.310
but this is the book for which he will be remembered.

73
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.540
You might think it odd that a book with a title like that could have become a

74
00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:12.280
best seller,
but it really was a philosophical bestseller when it was published,

75
00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:16.840
I believe in 1984 a and the addition you have,

76
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.993
um,

77
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.150
includes an off the word where he responds to critics of the original book.

78
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.960
So
how,

79
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:33.760
who is Alister Mcintyre and how does he relate to the,

80
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.790
the historical Auntie enlightenment?

81
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:43.720
Think as we've already discussed,
namely,
um,
Burke and Devlin.

82
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.150
Well,
uh,

83
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.280
he is very much in the spirit of the tradition in which they both wrote.

84
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.310
Although as you could probably guess from his historical trajectory,

85
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.830
one thing that differentiates Sam is that at least for much of his life,

86
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:03.860
he thought of himself as somebody on the political left,

87
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:06.980
whereas they were people on the political right.

88
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.730
And we'll come back to the significance of that later.

89
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.620
He is part of a general,
uh,

90
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.750
I'm toe or reaction against the Rawlsian enterprise in political theory.

91
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.550
Uh,
other thinkers,
uh,
uh,
which you are not waiting,

92
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:30.551
but with whom he would naturally have some elective affinities are the

93
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:35.000
philosopher Richard Rorty,
who died recently,

94
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.480
who wrote a fabulously good book called philosophy and the Mirror of nature,

95
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.380
which was a critique of the enlightenment project in philosophy.

96
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.903
Um,

97
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.210
arguing roadies argument was basically that the,

98
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.730
the enlightenment quest for certainty was a fool's errand.

99
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.540
That there is no such thing as certainty to be had.

100
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.960
We've discussed this quite extensively,
of course,

101
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.520
in connection with the early versus late enlightenment,

102
00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:12.260
which is not a distinction Richard Rorty made,
but India,
in any event,
he,

103
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:14.270
he made the argument that the,

104
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.630
the enlightenment quest for certainty was a fool's errand,

105
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:20.810
begun basically by Descartes and,
uh,

106
00:07:20.811 --> 00:07:25.700
taken to its apotheosis in cons critique of pure reason,

107
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:26.810
and that,

108
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:31.810
that the desc philosophers from Descartes to Kant got engaged in this hopeless

109
00:07:33.441 --> 00:07:37.280
endeavor of justifying philosophy from the ground up,

110
00:07:37.281 --> 00:07:42.140
from into biteable premises.
And when they failed to do that,

111
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.760
they thought that,
uh,
some important philosophical,
uh,

112
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.570
failure had occurred.
Whereas Rorty,

113
00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:53.870
his point was they should never be an engaged in that enterprise.
To begin with.

114
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:59.230
And he connects importantly to the modern pragmatists tradition of Dewey and

115
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:01.640
purse and James,
uh,

116
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:06.770
and to the postmodernist thinkers like,
uh,
[inaudible],

117
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:07.893
um,

118
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.680
to stomach sent Michel Foucault and others that we don't have time to read in

119
00:08:13.851 --> 00:08:17.060
this course.
So roared ea is an Auntie Maude and us,

120
00:08:17.061 --> 00:08:21.890
but he's a postmodernist anti modernist.
If you want lots of jargon,

121
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:26.750
he's thinks we should get beyond the enlightenment project.

122
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.920
He has also written some about politics.
Um,

123
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:35.750
and indeed he has a political analog of his philosophical argument,
which is,

124
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:36.620
is,
uh,

125
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:41.690
the bumper sticker version of it is that I'm thinking we have to justify our

126
00:08:43.161 --> 00:08:48.161
political institutions from the ground up is also a Mug's game and indeed a

127
00:08:48.291 --> 00:08:52.580
dangerous mug's game.
Because when we fail to do that,

128
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.910
we start to think that there's something with our political institutions that

129
00:08:56.911 --> 00:09:01.800
they're illegitimate because we couldn't justify them from the ground up

130
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.360
successfully by the terms of the enlightenment project.
Therefore,

131
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:07.920
they're not justifiable.

132
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:13.140
And this Rorty thanks puts us at a competitive disadvantage,

133
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:17.760
but he was writing during the Cold War.
So with,
uh,
our antagonists,

134
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.400
uh,
behind the iron curtain,

135
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.370
but I think he would make the same argument were he alive today about a

136
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.920
fundamentalist antagonists who,
uh,

137
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:33.660
we would buy roadies way of thinking it'd be putting ourselves at a competitive

138
00:09:33.661 --> 00:09:34.770
disadvantage with,

139
00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:39.771
by holding ourselves and our institutions to a standard which cannot be met.

140
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.150
And then when we fail to meet it,

141
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.540
losing confidence in our institutions.

142
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.160
So we could have read Richard Rorty in this course,
but he's,
the truth is,

143
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:50.461
and you know,

144
00:09:50.461 --> 00:09:54.930
this is a dogmatic statement and maybe some of you will second guessed me on it

145
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:56.190
later.
The truth is,

146
00:09:56.191 --> 00:10:01.020
Rorty is a much better philosophy then he is a political theorist.
And so we've,

147
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.560
I've chosen to have you read,
uh,
Mcintyre,

148
00:10:04.561 --> 00:10:09.060
who I think it's a better political theorist than he is a philosopher.

149
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.010
There are others.
Uh,
perhaps one of the most famous is Michael Walzer,

150
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.610
the who wrote a book called Spears of justice,

151
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:22.850
who also rejects the idea that the values guiding politics can be justified in a

152
00:10:24.841 --> 00:10:29.841
logical sense from intubate or for India biteable first premises and generate,

153
00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:35.990
um,
guides for action in politics that,
uh,

154
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:40.710
must be compelling to any right thinking,
rational person.

155
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.570
All of these thinkers,
Rorty walls,
a McIntyre,
um,

156
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:52.010
sometimes get grouped under this idea of communitarianism communitarianism and

157
00:10:53.701 --> 00:10:58.701
communitarianism is linked to the anti enlightenment endeavor in that it is the,

158
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:08.090
the a historical version of tradition that is instead of with Burke and um,

159
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:17.330
Devlin appealing to tradition as the basis for our values.

160
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:22.850
Communitarians Purdue appeal to the community accepted values as the basis for

161
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.640
what should guide us.
Now,

162
00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:31.320
obviously the two things are connected and we'll see they're deeply connected
in,

163
00:11:31.321 --> 00:11:36.321
in Mcintyre's a historical account because communities are shaped by traditions.

164
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.010
Um,
but at the end of the day,

165
00:11:41.011 --> 00:11:46.011
what's going to be important for us is that the individual is subservient to the

166
00:11:46.531 --> 00:11:51.531
community rather than the community being that creek creature or the creation of

167
00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:55.930
the individual.
So the community comes first,

168
00:11:55.931 --> 00:12:00.931
the individuals born into the community rather than the community being that the

169
00:12:01.031 --> 00:12:06.031
product of some contract or creation or construction of the individual.

170
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.890
Okay.
So that's what all of these thinkers share in common.

171
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.110
Now,

172
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.800
one of the things that makes Macintyre's book a little bit difficult to read is

173
00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:25.000
it's a work in the history of ideas that's written backwards.

174
00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:27.760
Um,
that is,

175
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:32.440
he starts with the present and works back to the ancients.
Uh,

176
00:12:32.441 --> 00:12:36.820
it's a very
interesting thing to do.

177
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.700
I expect,
I once taught the,
uh,

178
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.720
the political science one 14 course,

179
00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:46.660
the intro to the history of ideas.
And I,

180
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:50.920
it partly inspired by Macintyre effort.
I did it backwards.

181
00:12:50.921 --> 00:12:55.690
I went from roles to Plato and that there are interesting pedagogical,

182
00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:59.260
uh,
challenges there.

183
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:03.130
And I'm not sure whether it's worth doing just for its own sake,

184
00:13:03.131 --> 00:13:07.570
but macintyre does it for a reason.
I'm not just to be cute,

185
00:13:07.571 --> 00:13:10.340
which I think maybe I was trying to do.
Um,

186
00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:15.660
Mcintyre's does it for a reason and his reason is that he thinks that at

187
00:13:18.101 --> 00:13:21.010
sometime around the beginning of the enlightenment,

188
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:26.650
the western intellectual project went badly off the rails.

189
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:28.660
And,
um,

190
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:34.020
in some way his argument is an analog of the argument I made to you about lock,

191
00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.870
uh,
and workmanship.
Because off row,
think about the,

192
00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:41.830
what I said about lock and workmanship.
I said there was a,

193
00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:44.680
basically a coherent story.
You know,

194
00:13:44.681 --> 00:13:48.290
God created the world.
He has workman,

195
00:13:48.291 --> 00:13:51.730
shipped a knowledge and writes over it.

196
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.140
He creates humans with the capacity to act in a godlike fashion,

197
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.220
miniature gods,

198
00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:02.460
although that constrained by God's swell and it all fits together as a kind of

199
00:14:05.141 --> 00:14:10.141
coherent hole once you buy into the premises in all fits together.

200
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:15.010
But then what happens in,
in the history of,
uh,

201
00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:19.840
the workmanship model is people start to secularize it.

202
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:24.900
And so start taking on bits and pieces of the original workmanship idea without

203
00:14:26.351 --> 00:14:30.940
the unifying a assumptions that gave that model.
It's coherence.

204
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:35.200
And we saw the various difficulties everybody ran into,
uh,

205
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:40.030
in doing that marks and Nozick and roles and many others.
Uh,

206
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:45.400
so Macintyre's does something analogous in his book.

207
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:50.730
What he wants to say is that the task of coming up with compelling moral values

208
00:14:55.431 --> 00:15:00.431
to guide politics made sense in a frame of framework of assumptions that we

209
00:15:03.831 --> 00:15:08.520
inherited.
But we inherited in a kind of,
um,

210
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:13.600
degraded way that the unifying assumptions that used to give political morality,

211
00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:21.791
it's coherence have been jettisoned as a byproduct of the enlightenment project.

212
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:25.280
And for that reason,

213
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:30.580
we need to go back in time and see where the project went off the rails,

214
00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:38.140
see what it was that happened that caused modern thinkers to get involved in

215
00:15:40.131 --> 00:15:45.131
this fool's errand of justifying morality from the ground up.

216
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.490
Uh,
justifying from morality,
from the ground up,

217
00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:54.491
cannot be done because of the expectations about justification that we have

218
00:15:56.991 --> 00:15:58.960
developed.
But,

219
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
but Macintyre's claim is you can't see that unless you go backwards in time to

220
00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:09.440
understand how and where the project went off the rails.

221
00:16:09.441 --> 00:16:14.441
So that's the big enterprise of his book and will mostly get into that big

222
00:16:15.711 --> 00:16:18.140
enterprise on Wednesday.

223
00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.710
But I want to focus at the,
at,

224
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:26.720
at the start on the beginning of his book and it's the beginning of his book

225
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:30.200
deals with the symptoms of our problem.

226
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.710
And once one,

227
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.760
perhaps the most important symptom of our problem,

228
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:42.260
you've already confronted in this course when we talked about the transition

229
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:47.530
from classical to neoclassical utilitarianism and the rise of emotive as call

230
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:52.010
Stevenson and all that.
Anyone remember,

231
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.160
maybe have already forgotten all of this was so long ago.

232
00:16:55.161 --> 00:16:58.010
Now remember Stevenson said,

233
00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:03.320
this is the guy who didn't get tenure in the Yale philosophy department because

234
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:08.500
he seemed to have this extreme relativistic and subjectivist view of ethics

235
00:17:09.501 --> 00:17:13.430
where moral choices were just differences in taste,

236
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:18.490
differences in flavors of ice cream use.

237
00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.760
You say,
you know,
um,
the welfare state is good.

238
00:17:22.761 --> 00:17:26.810
I say the welfare state is bad.
It's just like saying,
uh,

239
00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:32.320
uh,
chocolate ice cream is good.
Uh,
or you know,

240
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:37.250
strawberry ice cream is good.
That differences about morality,

241
00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:42.440
uh,
adjust merely subjective differences.
So it's uh,

242
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.790
you know,
we go from this,
um,
certainty,

243
00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:47.630
uh,

244
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:52.630
subjective certainty and the early enlightenment is being making politics like

245
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.620
mathematical Gr,

246
00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:59.650
gr geometric proofs for Hobbes and Locke to the mere subjectivism of the mature

247
00:18:01.711 --> 00:18:02.341
enlightenment,

248
00:18:02.341 --> 00:18:07.140
which produces this kind of relativistic morality where everything is just

249
00:18:07.141 --> 00:18:09.150
subjective opinion,

250
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:13.380
that morality is nothing more than emotion.

251
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.760
And,
um,

252
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:21.060
there's no particular reason even to think we have the same emotions.

253
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.110
Remember that as I think I said to you at the time,

254
00:18:25.111 --> 00:18:28.800
Stevenson was criticizing,
uh,

255
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.730
David Hume,
who was another important,

256
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:37.830
a utilitarian thinker who we didn't have time to read in the scores either,

257
00:18:37.831 --> 00:18:40.720
but you should all read at some point,
uh,

258
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:44.940
in your lives and human said,
well,
yes,
you can't get,

259
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:49.970
you can't get any important statements about what ought to be the case from

260
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:55.860
empirical statements about the world.
There's no way to get from is two ort,

261
00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:00.930
as Jim said.
But you know what?
Most people are pretty much alike.

262
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:05.220
Most people are pretty much the same.
So we can,

263
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.630
to use the jargon of a utilitarianism,

264
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:13.640
we can make it pretty confident interpersonal judgments about people.

265
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.960
People are pretty similar.

266
00:19:15.961 --> 00:19:20.580
And so what's good for one person is likely to be good for another.

267
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.780
And that's why,
uh,
Hume has this rare,

268
00:19:24.781 --> 00:19:29.781
the cryptic one liner that scholars have debated to the effect that if all

269
00:19:30.421 --> 00:19:34.710
factual questions were resolved,
no moral questions would remain.

270
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:38.460
It's this notion what people are pretty much the same.
Uh,

271
00:19:38.461 --> 00:19:43.461
and so even though a morality is rooted in people's emotional reactions to

272
00:19:44.911 --> 00:19:47.190
situations,
um,

273
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:52.530
it's not a big problem to having a morality that can form the basis of a
society.

274
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.020
Stevenson said,
how do you know,

275
00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:00.690
how do you know how to you David Hume?
Now maybe,
um,

276
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:02.730
you know,
add off.

277
00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:07.380
Eichmann has one set of emotional reactions to the prospect of shipping people

278
00:20:07.381 --> 00:20:09.120
off to concentration camps.

279
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:14.330
And you and I have a different set of emotional reactions to shipping people off

280
00:20:14.431 --> 00:20:15.930
to concentration camps.

281
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:21.150
And if you're saying there are no principles by which we can adjudicate among

282
00:20:21.151 --> 00:20:23.910
those reactions,
those emotional reactions,

283
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:29.100
you throwing us into a sea of relativism.
And so,

284
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:33.630
um,
when you get too emotive ism,

285
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:38.990
you're getting to this world in which we are completely without instruments,

286
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:45.000
for making moral judgments.
When people disagree,

287
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.460
that is the emotive just culture.

288
00:20:48.461 --> 00:20:53.461
It's a culture of tastes and not interpersonal judgments.

289
00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:01.470
And one of the things Mcintyre wants to say is that all of this becomes

290
00:21:02.411 --> 00:21:05.680
inevitable in the 17th century.

291
00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:10.060
It's just a question of time.
It's just a question of time.

292
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:11.170
Uh,

293
00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:16.170
once you look at what was really going on in the beginning of the enlightenment,

294
00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:22.320
you're going to wind up with a motive isn't just a question of time.

295
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:27.580
And the politics that comes out of it is pretty ugly,
right?

296
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.700
The politics that comes out of it,
uh,

297
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:35.760
basically leaves you without standards of moral judgment and indeed without

298
00:21:36.791 --> 00:21:39.820
questioning the raw assertion of power.

299
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:42.850
So it's not only that philosophy,

300
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:47.080
we wind up with emotive as him,
but in politics,

301
00:21:47.081 --> 00:21:49.480
we're ultimately going to wind up with nature.

302
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:54.540
We're going to wind up with kind of knee her list assertion of the

303
00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:02.470
inevitability of the triumph of the will,
the triumph of power.

304
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:05.450
So,
um,
again,
nature.

305
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:09.250
Somebody else I wish we had time to talk about in this course,

306
00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:11.020
but you'll have to read him for,

307
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.130
for our purposes through the eyes of Mcintyre.

308
00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:20.700
So it all goes bad around the late 16th,

309
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:25.830
early 17th century and then we're just rolling down this hill into um,

310
00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:32.350
the best of modern subjectivism in philosophy and uh,

311
00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:36.000
neolistic politics.
Um,

312
00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.790
pretty depressing story.
You might think.

313
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.300
So that's one symptom that we live in.

314
00:22:43.301 --> 00:22:48.301
This what Macintyre wants to describe as an emotive vest culture.

315
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:57.970
Another symptom of it which you might not find as um,

316
00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:00.980
this spirit

317
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:07.180
as what I've just said is what we,

318
00:23:07.181 --> 00:23:09.370
this isn't mackintosh terminology,

319
00:23:09.371 --> 00:23:14.371
but I think it makes the point it's a world in which instrumentalism has

320
00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:21.240
triumphed a world in which there has been a total separation between means and

321
00:23:25.001 --> 00:23:25.834
ends.

322
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.560
One symptom of this,
again,

323
00:23:31.561 --> 00:23:33.840
not one he mentions in his book,

324
00:23:33.841 --> 00:23:38.640
but I think a captures neatly what he's talking about is

325
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.440
the proliferation of business schools.

326
00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:50.710
A hundred years ago there was no such thing as a business goal in a university.

327
00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:56.340
Nobody had ever thought of the idea of even having a business school.

328
00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:02.400
And what's I think note about,

329
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:07.430
about business schools is that they're teaching skills that are unrelated to

330
00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.680
purposes.
So

331
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:17.970
business schools after all

332
00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:24.420
are trying to teach people how to become good managers.

333
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:31.710
Where are they going to manage the Coca Cola Corporation or whether you're going

334
00:24:32.151 --> 00:24:33.670
to manage,
um,

335
00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:38.680
Goldman Sachs or where you're going to manage a university.

336
00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:44.530
The assumption is there a certain kinds of skills that managers have that it's

337
00:24:44.861 --> 00:24:46.000
important to know,

338
00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:53.170
but business goals will not teach you whether it's a good idea.

339
00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:58.540
Tim Managed Coca Cola or Goldman Sachs or Yale University.

340
00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:02.710
That is not what business schools are about,
right?

341
00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.590
So business goals,
if you like,

342
00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:10.620
are predicated on the divorcing of means from an they turned teaching certain

343
00:25:12.041 --> 00:25:14.320
kinds of instrumental skills

344
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:24.230
that you can find helpful regardless

345
00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:31.130
of what your,
what the enterprise is,
you're gonna end up managing

346
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:40.700
being a good manager is being somebody who is inherently an instrumental person.

347
00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:45.270
Right.
And,
um,

348
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:51.180
of course that leaves on answered the question well,

349
00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:55.770
but shouldn't we attend to what it is we are managing after all?

350
00:25:55.950 --> 00:26:00.900
That was a question that came up in our very first lecture in this course when

351
00:26:00.901 --> 00:26:03.090
we talked about the Eifman problem,
right?

352
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:08.310
That he didn't care he wanted to do while he wanted to impress a superior as he

353
00:26:08.311 --> 00:26:09.480
wanted to get an a,

354
00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:14.720
he was happy shipping Jews around the Third Reich to concentration camps as well

355
00:26:15.991 --> 00:26:16.824
as he could,

356
00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:21.300
but he would have been equally happy shipping munitions parts or,

357
00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.490
or for that matter,
you know,
office supplies.

358
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:28.950
It wasn't important as far as he was concerned.

359
00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:31.620
He wanted to be a good manager.

360
00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:37.100
So this is a very 20th century kind of preoccupation that we put the goal,

361
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:40.830
the purpose,

362
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:45.570
the ultimate endeavor aside.
And we say,

363
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:50.040
what are the characteristics of being an effective manager?
Right?

364
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:54.120
It's to use the philosophical jargon.

365
00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:56.103
Um,

366
00:26:56.670 --> 00:27:01.120
it is an a radically Auntie teleological.

367
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.640
You right?
Teleology,
teleological.

368
00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:09.060
We talked and I told you why Taylor,
what is teleological mean?
Somebody,

369
00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:15.980
right?
Tell us.
Comes from the Greek word.
Tell also purpose.
Goal director.

370
00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:18.003
<v 1>Right?</v>

371
00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:28.740
<v 0>Mcentire thinks that the rejection of teleology is a huge problematic,</v>

372
00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.920
enduring mistake.
Okay.

373
00:27:35.921 --> 00:27:40.660
And I'm going to come back to why in a,
in a few minutes,

374
00:27:40.661 --> 00:27:45.661
but first I want to return to the first symptom I mentioned about time.

375
00:27:45.921 --> 00:27:47.470
So these two symptoms,

376
00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:52.750
the rise of subjectivism and emotive as and the knee,

377
00:27:52.751 --> 00:27:57.100
holistic kinds of politics that brings with it on the one hand.
And secondly,

378
00:27:57.310 --> 00:28:00.280
this rejection of teleology on the other hand.

379
00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.320
And then say a little bit more about each of them.

380
00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.390
Neither of them is what it's seen,

381
00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.240
says Mcintyre.

382
00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:18.270
Who knows what the TV program that used to be on CNN for a long time called

383
00:28:19.901 --> 00:28:22.480
crossfire.
Was Anybody?

384
00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:25.600
Anyone have a seat crossfire on CNN?
Yeah.

385
00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.560
Tell us how it works like that.
Take the microphone and tell us how it works.

386
00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:34.630
How did it work?
Anyone?
You might be too young.

387
00:28:34.631 --> 00:28:39.400
It's kind of sad.
Yeah.
Some of you might not be quite too young.
How did it work?

388
00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:43.500
<v 2>I think it was like a point.
Counterpoint.
Yeah.
So how to change.
What's that?
Yeah.</v>

389
00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:47.880
So I'm not sure going into it whether you knew,
what should I do?

390
00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.670
You've definitely had to known which side you were debating or no,

391
00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:51.870
do they just kind of give it to you?

392
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:55.620
And then you either debated for or against a certain thing and then there was a

393
00:28:55.621 --> 00:28:58.260
judge at the end to decide who the winner was

394
00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:02.660
<v 0>basically.
Uh,
except for your last point,</v>

395
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:06.950
there was no winner.
I'll come back to that.
But basically you've got it right.

396
00:29:06.951 --> 00:29:11.951
The idea was they have a left wing host and a right wing house.

397
00:29:12.051 --> 00:29:16.510
So they would have,
you know,
Robert Novak as the right wing host.

398
00:29:16.511 --> 00:29:20.930
Then Michael Kinsley say somebody like that as the left wing host.

399
00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:26.180
Um,
and there would be some topic,
do juror,
you know,

400
00:29:26.181 --> 00:29:30.680
whether it was partial birth abortion or whatever,
the,
whatever it was,

401
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:35.090
the ta affirmative action.
Um,
uh,

402
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.350
and what would happen was,
uh,

403
00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:43.720
they would then usually have two guests and the guests were chosen also to be

404
00:29:45.371 --> 00:29:49.930
sort of ideologically different.
Right.
And the,

405
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:55.290
the Novak type person would fire questions at the left wing guests and the

406
00:29:56.690 --> 00:30:00.550
Kinsey LivePerson would fire questions to the right wing guests and they would

407
00:30:00.551 --> 00:30:05.400
argue back and forth and it would get more and more valuable,
uh,
and,

408
00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:09.700
and impassioned,
you know,
the,
and then at two minutes to eight,

409
00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:13.720
that commercial would come on and they would add.
Okay.

410
00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:18.990
And,
um,
why do I bring this up?

411
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:21.390
I bring this up because of,

412
00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:23.340
<v 1>okay.</v>

413
00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:28.340
<v 0>Mcintyre's observation right at the beginning of the book where he says,</v>

414
00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.300
this is certain odd feature tomorrow argument in this emotive it's world,

415
00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.950
there's a strange feature.
On the one hand,
it's subjectivist.

416
00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:40.560
<v 1>Okay.</v>

417
00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:45.560
<v 0>In all the ways we've talked about everybody's views equal to everybody else's,</v>

418
00:30:47.461 --> 00:30:51.690
we can't,
was no authoritative figure,
right?

419
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:55.650
There's no authoritative figure to settle our disagreements,

420
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.240
at least not an earthly one.

421
00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:03.030
And everybody is what they are and who they are.
And that's that.

422
00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:06.090
On the other hand,
McEntire says,

423
00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:11.330
if you look at things like abortion or affirmative action or nuclear weapons,

424
00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:17.790
people argue about these questions as though they were a right answer.

425
00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:20.963
<v 1>Okay?</v>

426
00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:23.400
<v 0>They give reasons for their views.</v>

427
00:31:23.401 --> 00:31:26.280
They tried to shut the other side's being hypocritical.

428
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:27.960
They say they want to say,

429
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.380
my premises are more plausible than your premises.

430
00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:36.480
They argue with each other as though there were an answer to this question,

431
00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:41.400
should we opt la law abortion,
we should we add more partial birth abortion.

432
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.190
The arguments they get into suggests they,

433
00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:47.640
that everybody's assuming there is an answer to that question.

434
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:50.813
<v 1>Right,</v>

435
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:54.660
<v 0>but actually nobody expects the question to be resolved.</v>

436
00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:57.570
And I thought that's why I mentioned the crossfire,

437
00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:02.870
because you know what could never have happened on that TV show is sort of

438
00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:06.550
<v 1>okay,</v>

439
00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:06.881
<v 0>you know,</v>

440
00:32:06.881 --> 00:32:11.881
at seven 46 Michael Kinsley turning to Novak and saying,

441
00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:14.533
<v 1>hmm,</v>

442
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.280
<v 0>no,
I never thought of that.
Actually.
Maybe you're right.</v>

443
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.330
That was the,
the the,
if they did that,
first of all,
the sponsors would pull,

444
00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:29.090
pull their commercials,
Kinsley would be fired.

445
00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:33.910
But that's not what it's about.
That's not what's some,

446
00:32:33.911 --> 00:32:36.200
but then,
but then it's bizarre isn't it?

447
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:41.230
Because if everybody agrees that we're all subjectivists right and that all our

448
00:32:44.721 --> 00:32:48.140
views are equally a tenable or untenable,

449
00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:52.370
which they seem to right,

450
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.840
then why is everybody going through the motions of arguing like this?

451
00:32:56.841 --> 00:32:59.180
Why is everybody saying,
you know what?

452
00:32:59.181 --> 00:33:03.050
I make any sense and this is misuse of evidence in your blah,
blah,
blah,

453
00:33:03.051 --> 00:33:05.450
and look my arguments much stronger and blah.

454
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:10.810
Why would anybody bother if we really believed the suggests this objectivism,

455
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.260
which we seem to take for granted.

456
00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:19.530
<v 1>Okay.</v>

457
00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:22.560
<v 0>That for Mcintyre is the real symptom</v>

458
00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.300
of what's wrong without circumstances.

459
00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:32.570
The fact that we engage in interminable moral arguments that we do not expect to

460
00:33:34.231 --> 00:33:39.231
be able to resolve is the symptom of the malady of our time in his view.

461
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:43.230
Because it suggests a kind of thirst

462
00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:47.850
and a set of expectations from the past.

463
00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:53.390
He wants to say that we need to be able to recover because,

464
00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:55.930
<v 1>okay.</v>

465
00:33:55.930 --> 00:34:00.930
<v 0>The fact that we carry on arguing suggests we don't want to accept this emotive</v>

466
00:34:01.931 --> 00:34:06.220
as culture.
We're not comfortable with it.
It's not emotionally,

467
00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:10.780
morally,
psychologically,
philosophically satisfying to us.

468
00:34:10.781 --> 00:34:11.950
Not even acceptable.

469
00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:15.340
<v 1>MMM.</v>

470
00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:19.960
<v 0>But,
so he thinks one of the things we need to be able to do</v>

471
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:27.650
is account for this puzzle,
this puzzle that we engage in.

472
00:34:27.651 --> 00:34:28.880
Moral argument,

473
00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:30.500
<v 1>okay?</v>

474
00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:35.500
<v 0>Using the forms of persuasive reasoning that we don't actually expect to</v>

475
00:34:37.221 --> 00:34:41.810
resolve.
So that po moral argument has this quality of,

476
00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.980
of crossfire,
right?
So that's,

477
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:51.560
that's the one thing that we need

478
00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:58.100
to get some kind of grip on if we're going to understand what's wrong with a

479
00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.180
motive as culture.

480
00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:07.050
The second is this problem with teleology.

481
00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.530
It they turn out to be related.

482
00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:15.240
But here's the problem with rejecting teleology,

483
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:17.820
<v 1>okay?</v>

484
00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:19.380
<v 0>If I walked in here,</v>

485
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:27.800
if I walked in here one morning and got up on this stage and I said to you,

486
00:35:28.351 --> 00:35:32.400
well,
this morning I got up,

487
00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.810
got dressed,
went for a run,
came back,

488
00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:41.620
took a shower,
I got dressed again,

489
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:46.540
started walking down to the office and I cross down to Orange Street.

490
00:35:46.541 --> 00:35:51.460
And then I cross Scana street.
I,
uh,
got down to Whitney at some point,

491
00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:54.220
pretty soon you'd say,
what is the point of this?

492
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:57.990
Why is he telling us this?

493
00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:10.100
Human beings always wanna know the purpose.
What is the point?

494
00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.080
So

495
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:22.380
we will never be satisfied with any activity that is point less,

496
00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.910
that doesn't have a point.

497
00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:29.000
And the enlightenment and Devaa off.

498
00:36:29.001 --> 00:36:32.360
Trying to be agnostic about purposes

499
00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:39.170
and scientific about means is never going to be satisfying to us for that

500
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.740
reason.
People want to know the point.

501
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:49.110
They want to believe their existence has have a point.
And um,

502
00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.300
if they don't,

503
00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:56.200
they become disaffected board agitated,

504
00:36:56.201 --> 00:36:59.080
I'm happy or worse.

505
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.333
<v 1>MMM.</v>

506
00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:12.140
<v 0>One he McEntire ash has a brilliant little essay called epistemological crises</v>

507
00:37:13.351 --> 00:37:17.790
and dramatic narratives where he,
he points out that,
um,

508
00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:20.881
if a little,

509
00:37:20.881 --> 00:37:25.290
if a young child asks you why the Earth doesn't fall down,

510
00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:30.690
you tell them,
say a story that it's being held up by a giant.

511
00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:34.260
That's why giants holding the earth in his hands.

512
00:37:34.261 --> 00:37:35.970
That's why it doesn't fall down.

513
00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:40.200
That's adequate for awhile.
Right.

514
00:37:40.201 --> 00:37:44.880
And then they asked for another story when they stop believing in giants,

515
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:45.570
but he's,

516
00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:50.570
he's claim is it something about the structure of human psychology that even,

517
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.140
you know,

518
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:56.700
explanations rooted in physics ultimately take the form of narratives.

519
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
People want to be able to tell a story that we fit into that has some point or

520
00:38:03.541 --> 00:38:05.310
purpose that we,

521
00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:10.400
our basic understanding of the world as is as teleological purpose of creatures

522
00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:16.730
who tell narratives to give point to their existence and we're going to become

523
00:38:19.561 --> 00:38:20.550
uncomfortable

524
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:27.800
if we don't have a way of understanding politics that has a point.

525
00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:32.190
So that is the,

526
00:38:32.191 --> 00:38:36.400
that is the symptom of how about

527
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:41.470
plight that we live in this emotive as well that we can accept and we have this

528
00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.870
bizarre love hate relationship with it.

529
00:38:44.871 --> 00:38:48.170
When you look at the kinds of moral arguments we actually engage in.

530
00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:49.460
And secondly,

531
00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:54.640
we live in this world in which we've tried to cope with the deep pluralism.

532
00:38:54.651 --> 00:38:59.651
Rawls writes about by taking goals off the table purposes off the table,

533
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.510
right?
And seeing can we just be a instrumental.

534
00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:09.050
So if you want another political theorists,

535
00:39:09.051 --> 00:39:14.051
we don't have time to read but has a good one liner to capture what Macintyre

536
00:39:14.811 --> 00:39:16.250
thinks is the problem.

537
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:21.550
It's Russo's line in the first paragraph of the social contract where he says

538
00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:27.730
he's going to come up with a design of institutions for society taking men as

539
00:39:29.451 --> 00:39:34.451
they are and laws as they might be taking men as they are and laws as they might

540
00:39:36.831 --> 00:39:37.580
be.

541
00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:42.580
And the reason Macintyre would think that problematic is taking men as they are

542
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:48.620
men and women,
we might say today as they are

543
00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:50.670
<v 1>okay.</v>

544
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:55.670
<v 0>Ignores important questions about how they have come to be as they are and what</v>

545
00:39:59.271 --> 00:40:04.271
the role of morality is in shaping and reshaping human nature.

546
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:11.810
So the title of the book is after Virtue

547
00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:14.990
and virtue,

548
00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:21.980
so-called what modern political model in philosophers call virtue ethics come

549
00:40:23.041 --> 00:40:27.060
out of a different tradition than anything we've considered thus far in this

550
00:40:27.061 --> 00:40:31.350
course.
Namely the Aristotelian tradition.
Right?

551
00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:36.210
Aristotle was the person who talked about the virtues.
Right.

552
00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.220
And,
um,

553
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:42.600
what Macintyre wants to say is we are,

554
00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:44.110
<v 1>yeah.</v>

555
00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:49.110
<v 0>At some important level that we don't fully appreciate or understand products or</v>

556
00:40:51.161 --> 00:40:52.860
the inheritors of

557
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:54.040
<v 1>okay.</v>

558
00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:57.640
<v 0>Uh,
kind of degraded Aristotelian tradition.</v>

559
00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:02.920
We have taken over concepts and categories with thinking about ethics from the

560
00:41:02.921 --> 00:41:05.050
Aristotelian tradition.

561
00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:06.390
<v 1>Okay.</v>

562
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:11.390
<v 0>But in a way that has become degraded in a way that abandoned the most important</v>

563
00:41:13.081 --> 00:41:18.081
assumptions behind the Aristotelian tradition that make it all hang together.

564
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:26.860
And the two key notions,

565
00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:29.553
<v 1>okay,</v>

566
00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:34.860
<v 0>the two analytical devices that make this argument work are what he calls a</v>

567
00:41:35.121 --> 00:41:39.440
practice and a virtue practice comes first.

568
00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:44.390
And I'll say a little bit about that and then I'll say a little bit about

569
00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:49.780
virtues and then we'll go into his argument in more detail on Wednesday a

570
00:41:51.531 --> 00:41:52.790
practice.
He says,
yeah,

571
00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:58.060
any coherent and complex form of socially established cooperative human activity

572
00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:03.500
through which goods internal to that activity are realized,

573
00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.570
not an engaging sentence.

574
00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:12.260
Let me try and give it content for you.
So first of all,

575
00:42:12.261 --> 00:42:16.850
the idea of a practice,
this is the intuition

576
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:24.070
when you walk into a class at Yale where the first time,

577
00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:26.230
say as a freshman,

578
00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:28.403
<v 1>okay,</v>

579
00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:30.100
<v 0>think about what you don't do.</v>

580
00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:36.280
You don't say to yourself,
how should this class be run?

581
00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:42.010
Let's see if we shall we.
You don't immediately interrupt other people and say,

582
00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:45.340
let's all decide how to run this class.

583
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:49.660
Let's shall we vote on it?
It was,
shall we talk about it?

584
00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:52.120
That's not what you do,
right?

585
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:57.610
When you walk into your first yell class as a freshman,
you sit down,

586
00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.600
you look around,
you say,
what's going on here?

587
00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.750
What are the norms?
What's expected of me?

588
00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:10.740
What am I suppose to do?
That's what you say to yourself.

589
00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:13.800
So right there,

590
00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:18.830
McEntire wants to say that the social contract metaphor is really bad.

591
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:24.200
The misleading of the human experience because people don't create Tabula Rasa.

592
00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:31.940
Rare that people are born into practices that they inherit from the past and

593
00:43:33.151 --> 00:43:37.320
reproduce into the future.
A practice is,
it's,

594
00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:42.210
it's complicated.
It's already socially established,

595
00:43:42.211 --> 00:43:43.290
it's ongoing.

596
00:43:43.291 --> 00:43:48.291
When you discovered people have been teaching courses at Yale for centuries and

597
00:43:49.801 --> 00:43:53.040
they've been freshmen who have walked into them and saying,
what do I do now?

598
00:43:53.041 --> 00:43:56.910
What's expected of me?
Right?
So the,
the,

599
00:43:57.070 --> 00:44:01.080
the point is that the practice precedes the participants,

600
00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:03.840
not the other way around.
Right?

601
00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:10.940
So that's the first idea at coherent and,
and complex.
It's,

602
00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:15.770
it's coherent in that it has some goal,
purpose,
right?

603
00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:22.400
Um,
enlightenment.
Let's say it's the purpose in this course,

604
00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:27.140
not in the sense of they enlightenment but enlightening you,
right?

605
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:30.440
Um,
socially established.

606
00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:35.230
It's cooperative that everybody,
uh,

607
00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:39.630
he wants to say practices are not coercive.
We'll come back to that later.

608
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.570
Let's go APP operative.
Um,

609
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:47.670
human activity through which goods internal to that activity are realized.

610
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:51.210
So that's an important term.
Internal.

611
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.640
And here he has in mind,
let's suppose,

612
00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:01.990
let's suppose you're playing chess.
Okay,

613
00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:04.610
you're paying chess with me and I,

614
00:45:04.611 --> 00:45:08.380
I have to go and answer the phone in the middle of the game.

615
00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:12.310
And while I'm,
while I'm not in the room,

616
00:45:12.311 --> 00:45:17.170
you take one of my points off the board,
come back and you win.

617
00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:21.400
That's not playing by the rules.

618
00:45:21.401 --> 00:45:24.880
That's not an internal realization of a good,
that's,

619
00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:30.220
that's what we would call an in his terminology,
external.
Right?

620
00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:35.820
So the idea of a practice is there are rules constituting the practice by which

621
00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:38.410
you have to excel.

622
00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:40.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

623
00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:45.840
<v 0>Right?
So you have to learn the rules,
right?
Cheating doesn't count,</v>

624
00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:49.200
right?
So that's the notion of a practice.

625
00:45:49.201 --> 00:45:52.110
I'll go into it in more detail.

626
00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:53.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

627
00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:58.840
<v 0>Virtues are what gift practices their point virtues have to do with the goals</v>

628
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:06.020
imminent in practices.
He says a virtue is an acquired human quality,

629
00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:11.290
the possession and exercise of which tends to enable us to achieve those goods,

630
00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:16.900
which are internal to practices and the lack of which effectively prevents us

631
00:46:17.481 --> 00:46:22.190
from achieving any such goods.
So

632
00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:28.870
what human beings want,

633
00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:31.810
I'll leave you with this thought and we'll pick up from it on Wednesday.

634
00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:37.080
What human beings want is to excel internally in practices.

635
00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:42.730
Says Macintyre,
you've all heard the phrase,
he's a pitcher's Pitcher,

636
00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:47.450
right?
When we say he's a pitcher's pitcher,
what are,

637
00:46:47.451 --> 00:46:51.800
what we have in mind is the notion that uh,
he's,

638
00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:53.970
he is so skilled

639
00:46:55.620 --> 00:47:00.270
that only a true pro can appreciate how skilled he really is.
Right?

640
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.930
So if I write books and I also build sheds,

641
00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:05.600
<v 1>okay,</v>

642
00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:09.680
<v 0>right.
If I show my books to people who know how to build sheds and they say,</v>

643
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:11.090
oh yeah,
really good book,

644
00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:16.190
and I show my carpentry to a bunch of nerdy academics and they say,
oh,

645
00:47:16.191 --> 00:47:17.180
that's really good.

646
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:22.070
That's not going to be satisfying to me because what I really want,

647
00:47:22.071 --> 00:47:23.600
I want to be a pitcher's pitcher.

648
00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:28.580
I want people who know about books to be impressed with my books and I want

649
00:47:28.581 --> 00:47:32.980
people know about carpentry to being pressed by my shed.

650
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:34.030
So that's the notion of,

651
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:39.150
of internal goods that every practice has goods by reference to which you excel

652
00:47:43.001 --> 00:47:44.140
within that practice.

653
00:47:44.141 --> 00:47:48.040
You don't want to win a chess by stealing the porn when a person's not looking,

654
00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:50.440
you want to beat them.
Uh,

655
00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:54.580
in terms of the norms and rules of playing good chess.

656
00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:59.110
So the,
the notion is,
uh,
you know,

657
00:47:59.111 --> 00:48:01.510
you walk into the classroom,
you want to get an Aa,

658
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.520
but not by downloading a paper off the internet.
You want to get the a,

659
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:07.480
uh,

660
00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:12.480
by reference to the norms and practices governing what goes on in the classroom.

661
00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:18.120
So that's the basic idea of virtues being internal to practices and giving them

662
00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:23.210
their point and anti wants to say that this,

663
00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:24.820
these two terms,

664
00:48:24.821 --> 00:48:29.821
these practices and virtue capture a lot more that is relevant about human

665
00:48:31.451 --> 00:48:32.530
psychology.

666
00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:36.490
Then the assumptions that drove the enlightenment,

667
00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:38.200
and we'll start with that on Wednesday.
