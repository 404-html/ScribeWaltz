WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.310
So last Wednesday I asked to you to suspend disbelief and bear with me as we

2
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:12.561
worked our way through the parade oh system as a way of backing into the

3
00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:15.390
political theory of John Stuart Mill,

4
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.050
which is going to be our subject today.
Um,

5
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:22.440
and I also promised you that as side benefit of,

6
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.180
of Wednesday's lecture,

7
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.230
which you would get to learn everything you ever needed to know about

8
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:32.770
neoclassical economics.
That in fact is true.
Um,

9
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.060
everything you ever do in economics is basically derived from our belt from

10
00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:43.530
those simple ideas that Paredo and Edgeworth put together.

11
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.360
So,
um,

12
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.390
it is indeed I think a side benefit of working through it.
But now I'm,

13
00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:56.391
what I want to do today is integrate what we saw in the parade oh system and the

14
00:00:58.531 --> 00:01:03.531
remarks I made about Stevenson's emotive ism and philosophy and come,

15
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:04.950
uh,

16
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.950
into the central arguments in political theory that are informed by these mature

17
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:13.680
enlightenment ideas.

18
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.850
And you're going to see why I talk about the mature enlightenment with respect

19
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:22.220
to male further on in today's lecture.
Um,

20
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.360
as you can see here,

21
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.390
I talk about male as attempting to synthesize rights and utility and you might

22
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:36.900
think,
well,
okay,
how's he going to do that?

23
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.340
Some of you who know a little bit more about mill may also think it's,

24
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.430
it's odd that I've chosen his little essay called on liberty for you to read,

25
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.310
uh,
in,

26
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.340
in explaining his utilitarianism when in fact mail wrote an essay on

27
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:58.050
Utilitarianism,
which I'm not having you read,
although I'm certainly,
uh,
I'm,

28
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.220
I'm not prohibiting you from reading it,
but I think that um,

29
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.400
once you can see is that the synthesis of rights and utility can be approached

30
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:12.390
from either end.
And,
um,

31
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.350
I'm going to MPR approach it from the rights end,
uh,

32
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:21.330
at least initially and then we'll worry about the utilitarian end of things

33
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.300
later.
Um,
but I think males,

34
00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:29.301
basic view is where they use start to develop a fully satisfying conception of

35
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:34.791
individual rights or whether you start to develop a fully sa satisfying

36
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:37.020
conception of utilitarianism,

37
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.940
you're going to end up incorporating the other one and those two into your

38
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.833
account.

39
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.690
Let me tell you a little bit about how John Stuart Mill was.
Um,

40
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.480
he was the son of James Male,

41
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.810
who had been a contemporary of Jeremy Bentham's.

42
00:02:54.811 --> 00:02:56.730
Indeed not only a contemporary,

43
00:02:56.731 --> 00:03:01.731
but actually a disciple of Bentham's and a true believer in Bentham's

44
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.090
utilitarianism,

45
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.180
including in the matter of the education of his son.
Um,

46
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.130
he was very,
uh,

47
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.230
concerned to give his son the most efficient possible education in order to get

48
00:03:17.371 --> 00:03:19.660
them to achieve at the highest level.

49
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.250
And so he was what we would today call homeschooled.
I'm there.

50
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:27.430
We'll governesses and school teachers brought to his home.

51
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:30.250
He never went to school.
And in the aid,

52
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:34.750
he turned out to be an a brilliant child.
Uh,
he was doing it,

53
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.550
um,
a differential calculus at a very young age.

54
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:43.160
He was speaking Latin and Greek in his teens.
Uh,

55
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.830
he was just as an astonishingly smart child.
And so they,

56
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.783
um,

57
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.820
ramped up his education at an incredible clip with the result that by the age of

58
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:58.330
21,
he actually had a nervous breakdown.
He had no friends.

59
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.320
He had no life.
It was a measurable,
brilliant nerd.

60
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.560
And he never entirely recovered from that experience.

61
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.730
And nor did he ever quite absolve Bentham.

62
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:16.540
And his father's a single mindedness,

63
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.160
um,
from responsibility for doing that to him.

64
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:22.450
Uh,

65
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.920
and he was a somewhat pained and tortured person in late,

66
00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:31.420
later in life.
I think he never quite shed the scars,
but his,
uh,

67
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.160
his wife Harriet,
who was a very interesting intellectual in her own right,

68
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.851
uh,

69
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:41.680
and wrote much of mill's famous essay that appeared over his name,

70
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.080
uh,
on the subjugation of women.

71
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.120
And indeed some mill scholars think that Harriet also had a big role in the

72
00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:53.770
writing of,
on liberty,
but that's more a speculative.

73
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.740
Um,
so he never quite got over that early,

74
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.460
uh,
shotgun oil utilitarian education.
Um,

75
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.510
but he also never entirely shed the commitment to the idea that utilitarianism

76
00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:15.130
is the best system for thinking about politics.
Uh,

77
00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:20.050
at one point he says,
I do endorse utilitarianism,

78
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.670
but only in the largest sense of man as a progressive being.

79
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.260
And we'll come back to what that might mean,
uh,
as we proceed.

80
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.450
So mail does have one,
um,

81
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.190
useful characteristic in,
in common with Bentham.
I think it's the only one,

82
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.230
as I said that Ben Thumb was one of these monomaniacal people.
Um,

83
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.760
and what makes him a useful to us as he takes an idea and runs with it to the

84
00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:53.570
absolute extreme.
And that's useful because you can see,
uh,

85
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.880
it's assumptions in a,

86
00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:59.881
in a very sharp and stark light mill is somebody who's aware of the infinitely

87
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:05.501
complex nature of human existence and is not as a Johnny one note in the sense

88
00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:10.100
that,
uh,
Bentham was,

89
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.600
and you'll see this very quickly as we get into his argument.

90
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.160
Nonetheless,
he shares in common with Bentham.
Um,

91
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.190
the feature that he reduces his doctrine to a single paragraph just as Bentham

92
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:29.960
data was the opening paragraph of his introduction to the principles of morals.

93
00:06:29.961 --> 00:06:32.240
And I just lation with mill,

94
00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:35.240
it comes about 12 pages in on the,

95
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.600
on the hack in addition that you're reading,

96
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.440
he says categorically,

97
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.120
the object of this essay is to serve a cert one very simple,

98
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:52.150
simple principle as entitled to govern absolutely sounds quite unequivocal.

99
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.130
The dealings of society with the Individual in the way of compulsion and

100
00:06:58.131 --> 00:06:58.964
control,

101
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.520
whether the means be used be the physical force in the form of legal penalties

102
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.970
or the moral coercion of public opinion.

103
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:13.300
That principle is that these soul and for which band kind of warranted

104
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:20.120
individually or collectively in interfering with the liberty of action of any of

105
00:07:20.121 --> 00:07:22.370
that number is self protection.

106
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.950
That the only purpose for which power can rightfully be exercised over any

107
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:32.951
member of a civilized community against his well is to prevent harm to others.

108
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.630
His own God,

109
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.590
either physical or moral is not a sufficient warrant.

110
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.830
He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or to forebear because it will be better

111
00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:49.841
for him because it will make him happier because in the opinions of others to do

112
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:51.950
so would be wise or even right.

113
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:56.240
These are good reasons for Ramond straighting with a more reasoning with him or

114
00:07:56.241 --> 00:07:58.190
persuading him [inaudible] treating him,

115
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:03.910
but not for compelling him or visiting him with any evil in Casey do otherwise

116
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.720
to justify that did that is to justify compelling him to conduct from which it's

117
00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:13.340
desired to deter him.

118
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.060
Must be calculated to produce evil

119
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.340
must be calculated to produce evil to someone else.

120
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:27.070
The only part of the conduct of anyone for which he is amenable to society is

121
00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:32.071
that which concerns others in the part which merely concerns himself.

122
00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:36.700
These independence is a bright absolute over himself,

123
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:41.440
over his own body and mind.
The individual is sovereign.

124
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.980
Anyone think they have any doubt about what he's saying?
I mean,

125
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.440
setting aside whether you agree with it seems,

126
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.880
Hey,
one thing you feel pretty clear about what he's saying is put up there about

127
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:02.500
what he is saying.
Never mind whether we agree with that.

128
00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.290
Understood.
Okay.
Well,
only one person feels clear,
I hope.
Feels unclear.

129
00:09:08.291 --> 00:09:12.650
Bodies what he's saying.
So we have one person is clear.

130
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.630
Nobody who signed for a year and 136 undecided.

131
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:19.693
<v 1>Wow.</v>

132
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.250
<v 0>I mean,
hey,
isn't it,
isn't it clear?
He's,
as I said,</v>

133
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.280
I'm not asking you whether you agree,
it's just saying,

134
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:32.330
unless you harm somebody else,
you've got to be left alone

135
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.940
and the state must a leave you alone and be stop.

136
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.110
Anyone else who wants to interfere with you,

137
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.650
hearkening back to Bentham's point that uh,

138
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.740
the Lord should stay the hand of a third party,
right?

139
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:48.030
That's what he's saying here.

140
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:50.263
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

141
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:52.800
<v 0>It's not rocket science.</v>

142
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

143
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:56.400
<v 0>It'd be,
it's very direct.</v>

144
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:58.110
<v 1>Okay.</v>

145
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.670
<v 0>Okay.
So that's what he's saying.
You might say.
Well,
okay.</v>

146
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.540
<v 1>Okay.</v>

147
00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:08.320
<v 0>I mean it,
just to give you an example,
he's saying,
you know,
um,</v>

148
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:14.130
if one of you comes to me at the end of this course and says,

149
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.990
I w professorship here,

150
00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:19.950
or what do you write me a letter because I want to go to law school.

151
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.620
And I say,
well,
you know,
I've come,
come to know you and,
uh,

152
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:30.360
you've got a lot of good qualities and skills,
but you're just not,

153
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:35.190
you're not a lawyer.
Trust me,
I've been around a long time.

154
00:10:35.191 --> 00:10:40.080
You should not go to law school.
The appropriate answer mail would say,

155
00:10:40.081 --> 00:10:44.220
yes.
Well thank you for your opinion.
I'm not asking you to tell me what to do.

156
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.970
I,
you know,
I can play it with you.
I can remind straight with you,

157
00:10:47.971 --> 00:10:52.110
I can try and persuade you.
But at the end of the day,
if you,
if you say,

158
00:10:52.111 --> 00:10:56.400
well thank you very much,
but I,
I'm going to law school,
uh,

159
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.940
I run up at the end of I shouldn't try to coerce you.

160
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:05.280
And not only that,
I,
I shouldn't try and get others to put pressure on you.

161
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:09.090
Right?
It's not,
not only should you not be compelled,

162
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.780
but we shouldn't try and coerce shoe with the,
you know,

163
00:11:12.781 --> 00:11:17.400
the moral force of public opinion.
We shouldn't start telling lawyer jokes,

164
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.730
uh,
to make you feel bad.
Right?

165
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:22.003
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

166
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:28.510
<v 0>So we have to respect the autonomy of the individual complete opposite,</v>

167
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.060
at least going in from where Bantham starch.
Right?

168
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.190
And one of the things you should see from this and you should,

169
00:11:37.191 --> 00:11:40.850
should be starting to go through your mind,
um,

170
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:46.480
is that there is a deep structural identity between males harm principle and the

171
00:11:48.831 --> 00:11:53.210
parade oh principle that we discussed last time.
I'll come back to that later.

172
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:58.780
But there's a basic structural identity between those two things.

173
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.320
Now you could say,
okay,
so male is saying,

174
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:04.280
<v 1>yeah,</v>

175
00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:08.720
<v 0>respect everybody's rights.
This is a strong theory of individual rights.</v>

176
00:12:08.721 --> 00:12:11.270
Unless somebody is harming somebody else,

177
00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.230
they have to be left alone and the state has to make sure that they're going to

178
00:12:15.231 --> 00:12:18.530
be left alone.
Fine.
That's just they,
we have rights.

179
00:12:18.531 --> 00:12:22.100
But what does this have to do with utilitarianism?
Right?

180
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:27.020
How does mail get from protecting freedom of the individual,

181
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.280
this robust doctrine of individual rights to the notion that we're going to

182
00:12:33.021 --> 00:12:36.260
maximize the utility in society.

183
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.233
<v 1>Okay.</v>

184
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.040
<v 0>Anyone have any idea?</v>

185
00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.460
Anyone?
Yeah.
Yes sir.
Wait for the microphone.

186
00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.490
<v 2>Does he argue that freedom leads to the highest level of pleasure that,
uh,</v>

187
00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:59.900
an individual pursuing?

188
00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.560
I guess given that type of freedom would gain utility from that and thus

189
00:13:03.561 --> 00:13:08.410
maximizing that type of freedom to level.
Why do we gain utility come freedom.

190
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:12.010
<v 0>Yeah.
Why?
Why,
why does,
why does,
in males mind,</v>

191
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:16.060
why does maximizing freedom also maximize utility?

192
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:21.610
I mean,
you're right,
you're dead right?
But this,
there's an intermediate step.

193
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:26.720
What's the,
yeah.
Okay.
Over here,

194
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.270
<v 2>according to mill,</v>

195
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.230
only individual people can decide for themselves what makes them happy

196
00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:35.990
<v 0>according to Male.</v>

197
00:13:35.991 --> 00:13:40.340
Only individuals can decide for themselves what makes them happy.

198
00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.730
That is also correct.
Um,

199
00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.700
but there's still another step in this that I want us to focus on that neither

200
00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:48.080
of you has mentioned yet.

201
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:52.873
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

202
00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:00.120
<v 2>Is that individuals knowing their own desires will bargain with one another.
Um,</v>

203
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:04.800
using their freedom to,
to gain the mutual maximum youtube.
Very

204
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.431
<v 0>good point.</v>

205
00:14:05.431 --> 00:14:09.540
And that that is where the identity with the predo principal comes in.

206
00:14:09.541 --> 00:14:12.210
If you leave people alone,
right,

207
00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.260
they will do what they want with themselves or not.
We'll all with others.

208
00:14:16.261 --> 00:14:21.261
And so what males harm principle allows in politics is the sort of analog of

209
00:14:23.251 --> 00:14:24.820
what the Predo Prince,

210
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:29.610
what's we were calling Paredo superior in economics.
That's also true,

211
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:34.860
but it's not what I was looking for a right now though,

212
00:14:34.861 --> 00:14:39.360
there's no reason you should know that because you can't read my mind.

213
00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:44.190
But this another step.
Thank thank back to the big picture.

214
00:14:44.191 --> 00:14:49.191
The big picture is all these enlightenment theories are committed both to the

215
00:14:49.621 --> 00:14:54.470
freedom of individual and to scientific truth.
Right?

216
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.850
Male is an enlightenment thinker of the first order.

217
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.120
If you flip,
throw your whole copy of on liberty,

218
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.760
you will see what is the longest chapter about?

219
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.450
What is the longest chapter about?
It's probably half of the book.

220
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.440
Freedom of thought and discussion,
right?
Freedom of speech.

221
00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:38.000
So why is freedom of speech so important?

222
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:41.840
Because mail thanks.
That is the path to the truth.

223
00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.070
Freedom of speech is the path to the truth.
Now,

224
00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.130
I want to spend a little bit of time on this because it's really important.

225
00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:56.140
It's really important
for two reasons.

226
00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:02.100
The first is you're going to see a very different conception of science

227
00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:05.080
informing mills work.

228
00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:10.990
Remember back to our discussion of the early enlightenment of Hobbes and Locke

229
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.210
of Ben Bentham.

230
00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:16.920
That truth was equated with certainty.
Remember,

231
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:17.820
they got the,
Oh,

232
00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:22.570
the 17th century people had this weird route to this because it wasn't what we

233
00:16:22.571 --> 00:16:24.430
think of as a priority truths,

234
00:16:24.431 --> 00:16:29.230
but things that were a product of wells and all that,
right?
But,

235
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:34.360
Oh,
you enlightenment.
Idea of science is to find certainty,

236
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.700
right?
Cart DAZN doubt.
Remember,

237
00:16:37.701 --> 00:16:40.210
he's looking for propositions that cannot be doubted.

238
00:16:40.211 --> 00:16:42.430
Things that can be known with certainty.

239
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.820
Male is a fallible last male,

240
00:16:45.821 --> 00:16:48.970
has a much more modern conception of science.

241
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:51.580
The one that you intuitively have,

242
00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.880
which says first of all that um,

243
00:16:55.870 --> 00:17:00.790
all knowledge is cartridge,
a ball,
all propositions,
uh,

244
00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:05.590
have to be evaluated by reference to evidence and the scientific method.

245
00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:10.300
And we could always be wrong in doing that,
uh,

246
00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.160
in our attempts to do that.

247
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:17.640
So a very important move in the history of the philosophy of science in this

248
00:17:18.791 --> 00:17:23.791
regard was to move away from talking about what philosophers used to use the

249
00:17:24.581 --> 00:17:26.260
word verification ism,

250
00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:31.770
proving that a scientific theory is correct and instead starting to talk about

251
00:17:32.591 --> 00:17:33.700
falsification,

252
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:38.650
ism proving that it hasn't yet been falsified.

253
00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:43.600
And so any of you who takes a statistic scores,
uh,

254
00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:44.561
in,

255
00:17:44.561 --> 00:17:49.560
in the social sciences will know what you have is a hypothesis and empirical

256
00:17:49.561 --> 00:17:53.220
hypothesis saying,
you know,
a

257
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:59.700
high tax rates,
cores,
um,
hike tracks,
rights lead to,

258
00:17:59.701 --> 00:18:02.880
to inflation and you go and you will,

259
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.700
you'll test it against the evidence and it,

260
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:10.200
you'll have some other hypothesis that that will be called the competing

261
00:18:10.201 --> 00:18:10.920
hypothesis.

262
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:15.870
So the now hypothesis and all you'll ever be able to say is that your,

263
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:20.010
your hypothesis hasn't been shown to be false.

264
00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:21.620
You don't never know you,

265
00:18:21.621 --> 00:18:26.130
you'll never know for certain that some other hypothesis couldn't do better.

266
00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:30.120
Okay,
so false.
This is falsification.

267
00:18:30.121 --> 00:18:33.660
Sm is the idea that would eventually become,
uh,

268
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.020
associated with the f the philosopher called popper,

269
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:41.310
who we don't read in this course,
but it's this idea that um,

270
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.510
knowledge claims are carriage,

271
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.560
all our knowledge claims might be wrong,

272
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:51.770
and the scientific attitude involves recognizing that and acting accordingly.

273
00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.680
So it's the mature enlightenment.

274
00:18:55.681 --> 00:19:00.681
Conception of science means you have to be committed to an s finding the truth

275
00:19:02.071 --> 00:19:03.660
as an ongoing quest.

276
00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:09.030
And this is really important for male,
okay?

277
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.960
So freedom of speech is really important for male as a path to the truth,

278
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.520
as the path to the truth,

279
00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.020
<v 1>okay?</v>

280
00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.540
<v 0>Now that's one reason it's important.</v>

281
00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.920
The second is that male injects into

282
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.580
a desirable political system.

283
00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:38.290
The importance of argument arguing,

284
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:40.480
<v 1>okay,</v>

285
00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.350
<v 0>this is going to come up again and again in the course,</v>

286
00:19:43.351 --> 00:19:47.820
particularly in the last section when we get to democratic theory,

287
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:52.560
when I say mill talks about the importance of argument,

288
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:55.620
this is very different from deliberation.

289
00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:01.260
It's not the idea that we should all get together and hold hands and sing

290
00:20:01.261 --> 00:20:03.690
Kumbaya and see what we can agree about.

291
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.450
That's the sort of deliberative ideal,
right?

292
00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.750
The liberation arguing my days.

293
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.550
How many here have seen prime minister's questions on TV?
Right?

294
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:19.740
That's argument.
Okay,
well cross fire,
uh,
the TV program,

295
00:20:19.741 --> 00:20:24.741
that's argument where people whole the best criticisms they can come up with

296
00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.510
against the other side.
It's,

297
00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:32.520
it's not surprising they were male is often how to be responsible for the

298
00:20:32.521 --> 00:20:34.980
metaphor of the competition of ideas.

299
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:41.690
These are two very different models of the role of speech in politics.

300
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.960
Just to give you an example of what's at stake here,

301
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:55.510
there's a lot of experimental work that's been done on it by social

302
00:20:55.761 --> 00:20:58.340
psychologists.
Um,

303
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:00.180
<v 1>okay.</v>

304
00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.640
<v 0>On this question.
So suppose,</v>

305
00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:08.100
suppose as a field and in the middle of the field there is a cow.

306
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:10.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

307
00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.820
<v 0>And we're all standing around the field.</v>

308
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:14.720
<v 1>Okay.</v>

309
00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:19.720
<v 0>Looking at the cow and the question is what does the cow way,</v>

310
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:25.840
I'm think about two ways of tackling this question.

311
00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:31.570
One would be that we all discuss what,
what do you think the cow ways,

312
00:21:31.571 --> 00:21:36.250
what do you think of ways and we eventually reached some agreement upon what we

313
00:21:36.251 --> 00:21:39.070
think the cow ways and we go with that number.

314
00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:40.640
<v 1>Okay.</v>

315
00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:44.510
<v 0>The second approach would be to say we don't talk to each other at all.</v>

316
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:51.350
Each of us looks at the cow and makes our own best judgment about what the cow

317
00:21:53.731 --> 00:21:57.600
ways we add them all up and divide it by the number of people.

318
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:06.370
Which which method you think is more likely to get the white of the cow

319
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:07.263
accurate?

320
00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:12.490
How many people think the deliberative method hands up for the liberal of the

321
00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.333
method?

322
00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:14.520
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

323
00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.690
<v 0>Okay.
It looks like about a third of you.
How many for the,</v>

324
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:22.430
the non deliberative additive method.
Okay,
so you went to to one.

325
00:22:22.431 --> 00:22:26.810
Well it turns out you're right,
it turns out,
um,

326
00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:28.430
<v 1>okay.</v>

327
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:33.230
<v 0>That the,
the non deliberative additive method is raw,
gets to the,</v>

328
00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:36.230
gets the answer right?
Almost.
Exactly.

329
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:39.110
Whereas the deliberative method goes all over the place.

330
00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.200
Now there's lots of speculation about why

331
00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:48.140
now,
why one,
one reason could be,

332
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.870
while the trouble with the deliberative method he has,
you know,
it,

333
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:59.350
it's going to lead people to listen to strong personalities or people who think

334
00:23:00.771 --> 00:23:04.940
they know more than they do.
You know,
lay on need.
They're over there.
Says,
look,

335
00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:08.990
you know,
I grew up on a farm.
I don't tell me about cows.

336
00:23:08.991 --> 00:23:12.620
I know everything there is to know God cows.
Why don't you people know?

337
00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:17.120
And I say that a cow is where it weighs 1500 pounds,

338
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.440
you know,
and then a lot of other people say,
well,
he did,
he grew up on a farm.

339
00:23:21.441 --> 00:23:26.000
Where do I know?
And so maybe opinion gets swayed in that way.

340
00:23:26.001 --> 00:23:30.350
That's that.
That's one possible reason.
Um,

341
00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:35.040
people make copy what other people say just because they,
they,

342
00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.600
they don't know it Cetera.
But for whatever reason,

343
00:23:38.601 --> 00:23:42.350
and we could speculate and when we come to talk about deliberative democracy

344
00:23:42.351 --> 00:23:44.980
later,
we'll go into it more.
Um,

345
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:49.550
I just wanted to flag this distinction.
That argument is not deliberation.

346
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.820
Okay?
And so,
um,

347
00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.940
when Michelle talks about argument,
it's,

348
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.210
it's rare that this idea that um,

349
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:04.370
everybody makes their own independent judgment.
Uh,
he wants our,

350
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:08.630
our capacity to make that judgment to be strengthened,

351
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:13.140
but that's not the same thing as deliberation.

352
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:17.600
He wants us to have our own individual robust judgments and trust them.

353
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:21.830
Okay?
That is,
that is his ideal

354
00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:27.340
and we should never ever kowtow to the opinions of others.

355
00:24:27.341 --> 00:24:29.350
This is not a deliberative model.

356
00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:34.770
And indeed male gives us four reasons for thinking that freedom of speech is

357
00:24:35.441 --> 00:24:40.300
important.
For one thing,
he says,
yeah,
this,

358
00:24:40.301 --> 00:24:44.650
this is the
point about Falabella awesome.

359
00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:45.611
He says,

360
00:24:45.611 --> 00:24:50.611
if any opinion is compelled to silence that opinion for all we might know might

361
00:24:51.371 --> 00:24:55.870
be true,
to deny that is to assume our infallibility.

362
00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:01.240
So science is not about certainty.
It's not about faith,
right?

363
00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:06.280
It's recognizing that whatever we say might be wrong.

364
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:11.020
Secondly though is silenced opinion be in error.

365
00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:16.080
It may and very commonly does contain a portion of the truth and since the

366
00:25:17.021 --> 00:25:21.790
general prevailing opinion on any subject is rarely or never the whole truth,

367
00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.540
it is only by the collision of adverse opinions.

368
00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:28.670
That's prime minister's questions.
That is crossfire,

369
00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:30.910
the collision of adverse opinions

370
00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:37.960
that the remainder of the truth has any chance of being supplied.

371
00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:43.690
Third,
even if the received opinion be not only true,

372
00:25:43.691 --> 00:25:45.010
but the whole truth,

373
00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:49.990
unless it has suffered to be an actually is vigorously and turn and earnestly

374
00:25:49.991 --> 00:25:54.991
contested it well by most of those who receive it be held in the manner of a

375
00:25:55.241 --> 00:26:00.241
prejudice with little comprehension or feeling of it's rational grounds.

376
00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:04.120
That is you don't want to only get the right answer,

377
00:26:04.121 --> 00:26:07.120
you want to get the right answer for the right reason.

378
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:11.590
If you copy somebody math assignment when you can't do the problem,

379
00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.420
you have the right answer,

380
00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.140
but you haven't got the right answer for the right reason.

381
00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.570
And not only this,
but fourthly,

382
00:26:19.571 --> 00:26:24.130
the meaning of the doctrine itself will be in danger of being lost or in feeble

383
00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:29.200
and deprived of its vital effect on the character and conduct the dogma of

384
00:26:29.201 --> 00:26:33.250
becoming a mere formal profession in effect,
Keisha's for good,

385
00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:38.230
but cumbering the ground and preventing the growth of any real and heartfelt

386
00:26:38.231 --> 00:26:42.190
conviction from reason or personal experience.

387
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:48.950
So you can say that male is in some ways what we would think of today as a

388
00:26:50.431 --> 00:26:53.430
libertarian.
He's got this idea of freedom of speech.

389
00:26:53.431 --> 00:26:58.110
We should all be left alone to do is we like without interference from the
state,

390
00:26:58.111 --> 00:27:02.490
except when the state stops others from interfering with us,
right?

391
00:27:02.491 --> 00:27:06.660
What Nozick will later call the night watchman,
state of liberal theory,

392
00:27:06.661 --> 00:27:11.520
this negative freedom standard libertarian view.
On the other hand,

393
00:27:11.521 --> 00:27:15.000
he's also a kind of romantic individualist,
right?

394
00:27:15.001 --> 00:27:19.650
He sees individual human flourishing.
Somebody said he had the path,

395
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:24.000
the path to happiness.
Everybody knows they're the in our own sources of utility.

396
00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:27.180
Nobody can tell you what makes you happy.

397
00:27:27.181 --> 00:27:30.960
This is the link just Stevenson we were talking about last time.

398
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:35.280
I can't tell you what should be in your utility function.
I don't know.

399
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:37.920
No interpersonal comparisons of utility.

400
00:27:37.921 --> 00:27:42.690
That's the link to parade [inaudible] so you can see in all of these fields this

401
00:27:42.691 --> 00:27:46.020
move to,
it's not miss objectivism,

402
00:27:46.021 --> 00:27:50.760
it's the romantic celebration of subjectivism,

403
00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:51.870
right?
The,

404
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:56.870
the full flourishing of your potential can only happen if you

405
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.910
are allowed
total freedom of speech,

406
00:28:04.911 --> 00:28:07.700
of,
of,
of anything you want to do.

407
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:09.420
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

408
00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.520
<v 0>So long as you don't harm others.</v>

409
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:16.760
And this is important not just for your own individual utility function,

410
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:23.660
but also because that's how society learns the Truth and truth is going to be

411
00:28:25.291 --> 00:28:29.550
important for the pursuit of utility.

412
00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:34.310
You need these tough minded credit.
We should all be in,
you know.

413
00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.250
Whereas for Locke,

414
00:28:35.251 --> 00:28:39.840
we were all miniature gods who have maker's knowledge of our creation for Loc

415
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:44.310
were all minute four,
four mil.
We're all managers,
scientists.

416
00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:48.450
We should,
we've got to have the critical attitude and we,
you can't learn,

417
00:28:48.451 --> 00:28:52.470
get a critical attitude if you're,
if you're copying other people's math,

418
00:28:52.471 --> 00:28:57.471
you have to be able to defend your reasoning to all commas.

419
00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.820
You have to stand there.

420
00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:04.940
Like Gordon Brown at Question Time and have people hurl counter examples at you,

421
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.510
not people who are trying to get your agreement.
Okay.

422
00:29:09.511 --> 00:29:13.140
It's the combat of ideas that the clash of ideas,

423
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:17.250
that's the truth comes out as a byproduct of that.

424
00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:20.730
Just as in the invisible hand theory of markets,

425
00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:22.950
that truth is a byproduct.

426
00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:28.200
It efficiency is a byproduct of lots of individual transactions.

427
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:30.773
Right?

428
00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:32.350
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

429
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:35.230
<v 0>So that,
that is uh,
that is the,</v>

430
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:38.020
the connection if you like,

431
00:29:38.021 --> 00:29:43.021
between males idea of the importance of each individual getting the truth for

432
00:29:43.331 --> 00:29:46.660
themselves and the parade.
Oh,
principle.

433
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:50.110
In both cases it's an invisible hand explanation,

434
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:55.440
which says as a byproduct of this utilitarian efficiency is maximized.

435
00:29:58.930 --> 00:29:59.520
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

436
00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:04.520
<v 0>That's why the chapter on freedom of speech is central to this doctrine.</v>

437
00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:12.680
Okay.
So all well and good you might say,
but

438
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:20.230
how many read the,
to the end,
the chapter on applications

439
00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:23.760
all starts to unravel,

440
00:30:23.761 --> 00:30:28.290
it seems once we get to the chapter on applications.
Yeah.

441
00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:33.320
Mel says in many cases an individual but suing a little legitimate object

442
00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:39.050
necessarily and therefore legitimate causes pain or loss to others.

443
00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:40.673
Oh,
NSF.

444
00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:45.770
A good which they had a reasonable hope of attaining such opposition of interest

445
00:30:46.501 --> 00:30:50.820
between individuals often arise from bad social institutions,

446
00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:56.180
but a unavoidable while those institutions last and some would be unavoidable

447
00:30:56.191 --> 00:30:57.720
under any institutions.

448
00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:02.280
Whoever succeeds in an overcrowded profession

449
00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.630
or in a competitive examination,

450
00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:12.660
whoever is preferred to a Nada in any contest for an object which both isyeah

451
00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:17.800
rapes benefit from the loss of others from their wasted exertion and

452
00:31:17.801 --> 00:31:18.634
disappointment,

453
00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:24.310
but it is by common admission better for the general interest of mankind.

454
00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:30.570
That person should pursue their objects undeterred by this sort of consequences.

455
00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:31.721
In other words,

456
00:31:31.721 --> 00:31:36.721
society admits no right either legal or moral in the disappointed competitors to

457
00:31:38.111 --> 00:31:43.111
impunity from this kind of suffering and feels called on to interfere only when

458
00:31:46.511 --> 00:31:49.030
means of success of employed being employed,

459
00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:54.240
which is contrary to the general interest to permit namely fraud or treachery

460
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.670
and force.
What's the problem with all of that?

461
00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:03.010
It's not exactly eloquent,
but what?
What?
What is the,
what's the problem?

462
00:32:03.011 --> 00:32:07.900
There is an isn't their problem?
Maybe there's no problem.

463
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:25.150
That's called a clue.
What's the problem?

464
00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:26.973
Yeah.

465
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:29.740
<v 3>According to this,</v>

466
00:32:29.741 --> 00:32:33.760
couldn't you reason that something like the Holocaust was okay if it's in the

467
00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:37.270
general interest of mankind or any kind of

468
00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:42.500
<v 0>yeah,
Mitch is a big problem,
right?
I mean,
did he say earlier Ron,</v>

469
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:44.960
that um,

470
00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:51.740
people can't be coerced into accepting results just because the majority

471
00:32:53.521 --> 00:32:56.160
believes that under any wind out of his way,

472
00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:58.740
he went out of his way to say,

473
00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:00.490
<v 1>yeah.</v>

474
00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:05.490
<v 0>Whether it's the actions of the majority or the moral coercion of public</v>

475
00:33:06.481 --> 00:33:07.890
opinion,
but he's saying,

476
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.970
but it is by common admission better that we have competitive exams.

477
00:33:11.971 --> 00:33:16.500
Of course the people who don't get the job or harmed but still bad.

478
00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.710
Seems like a contradiction.
No.

479
00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:22.883
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

480
00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.670
<v 0>Give another example again,</v>

481
00:33:25.671 --> 00:33:30.671
trade as a social act whereby undertake stock to sell any description of goods

482
00:33:31.281 --> 00:33:36.140
to the public does what affects the interest of other persons and society in

483
00:33:36.141 --> 00:33:36.974
general.

484
00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:41.720
And that's his conduct in principle comes within the jurisdiction of society.

485
00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:46.310
Accordingly,
it was once Hal to be the duty of governments in all cases,

486
00:33:46.311 --> 00:33:50.900
which were considered of importance to fix prices and regulate the process of

487
00:33:50.901 --> 00:33:55.790
manufacturer.
But it is now recognized now,
not this love,

488
00:33:55.791 --> 00:33:59.090
this passive voice.
It is now recognized though,

489
00:33:59.091 --> 00:34:01.130
not til after a long struggle,

490
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:05.240
that both the cheapness and the quality of commodities are more effectively

491
00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:10.270
provided for by leaving the producers and sellers perfectly free under the sole

492
00:34:11.331 --> 00:34:16.160
check of equal freedom to the bias of supplanting themselves elsewhere.

493
00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:19.040
This is so called doctrine of free trade.

494
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:24.270
Would dress on grounds different from though equally solid with the principle of

495
00:34:24.951 --> 00:34:28.010
liberty asserted in this essay?

496
00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:32.633
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

497
00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:37.590
<v 0>same problem,
right?
It is not recognized by home.</v>

498
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:41.260
Why should we believe that?
And more importantly,

499
00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:46.000
aren't we supposed to be protected from the dominant view?

500
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:49.980
Right?
So free trade,
we,
you know,

501
00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:53.190
we think about the arguments we have today.

502
00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:58.020
This is a century later with the arguments we have about outsourcing.
Yes.

503
00:34:58.620 --> 00:34:59.190
Uh,

504
00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:04.190
they harm the interest of American workers when they move factories to Mexico.

505
00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:09.240
But males saying,
yeah,
it's true,
but you know,
free trades better.

506
00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:14.220
It's better from the standpoint of utilitarianism.

507
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:19.820
Big a problem.
It seems.

508
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:26.460
You think Mel was just actually not that smart.

509
00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:30.540
He didn't see this huge contradiction sort of.
Right.

510
00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:31.920
<v 1>Okay.</v>

511
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.460
<v 0>The minute you start to apply this doctrine,
it all just</v>

512
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:38.070
turns to sand.

513
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.940
Anyone think there's a way out of this from male?

514
00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:52.560
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

515
00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.890
<v 0>Well people have been struggling with us ever since he wrote it</v>

516
00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:01.950
because it does seem to be a big problem.
But on the other hand,

517
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:07.910
the Alere of this rights utility synthesis is so great that people want to find

518
00:36:09.661 --> 00:36:13.590
a white to solve it.
And I think this is how Mel thought about this.

519
00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.020
There's no contradiction at all.

520
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:21.720
I think that male thanks in terms of a two step test,

521
00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.830
step one is you say

522
00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:30.690
of any proposed action,

523
00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:35.790
is there going to be harm to somebody else?

524
00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.420
So,

525
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:44.120
<v 1>uh,</v>

526
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:52.670
<v 0>smoking marijuana
or in more,</v>

527
00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:57.230
I guess contextually appropriate at the time prohibition.

528
00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:02.420
This is a case that Mel considered,
uh,
in,
in what you read.

529
00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:04.641
If you go,

530
00:37:04.641 --> 00:37:09.641
if you go to your room and you get paralytic drunk or you get stoned and you

531
00:37:10.611 --> 00:37:13.970
sleep it off,
you're not harming anybody.

532
00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:15.973
<v 1>Okay.</v>

533
00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:20.870
<v 0>So it's protected.
Oh,
Mel was a libertarian in that sense.</v>

534
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:26.270
And you post prohibition,
which was a very live issue,
uh,
when he was writing.

535
00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

536
00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:32.650
<v 0>But there are a lot of activities where it's inevitable that there's going to be</v>

537
00:37:32.651 --> 00:37:36.670
hard.
You know?

538
00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:41.200
Yes,
it's true that protectionism harm some people,

539
00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:46.690
but any trade regimes going to harm some people,
right?
So,

540
00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:51.310
uh,
I'm sorry,
free trade arms,
American workers,

541
00:37:51.311 --> 00:37:56.050
but protectionism harms African workers or Indonesian workers,
right?

542
00:37:56.290 --> 00:37:59.660
Whatever you do for a trade policy,
they're going to,

543
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:03.790
there's going to be somebody who's going to be harmed or whatever system you

544
00:38:03.791 --> 00:38:06.430
have for giving away jobs in the civil service.

545
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:10.750
Whoever doesn't get the job's going to be harmed.
If you have pure competition,

546
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:15.670
uh,
the people who don't get the highest scores are going to be harmed.

547
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:18.760
Uh,
if you,
if you have,
you know,

548
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:23.920
a job reservation for whites as they had in South Africa,
then,
um,

549
00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:25.960
blacks are not going to get the jobs.

550
00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:30.500
If you have affirmative action to remedy past injustices,

551
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:35.250
um,
in the Connecticut Fire Department,
then,
um,

552
00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:40.000
the paper who would otherwise have have gotten the jobs are going to be harmed

553
00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:44.230
as the court supreme court said.
And,
and,
uh,
last year.

554
00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:50.110
So males point is you first make an inquiry.

555
00:38:50.111 --> 00:38:54.310
Is there a harm?
If the answer's no,
the action south regarding,
again,

556
00:38:54.311 --> 00:38:58.830
it's protected.
Free speech doesn't hurt anybody.

557
00:38:59.340 --> 00:38:59.680
<v 1>Okay?</v>

558
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.100
<v 0>That's why it's so important to protect it.
Indeed,</v>

559
00:39:03.101 --> 00:39:05.740
he wants to say the externalities of free speech,

560
00:39:05.741 --> 00:39:08.290
a positive we speech doesn't hurt anybody.

561
00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:11.200
Drinking doesn't hurt anybody.

562
00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:17.430
Now somebody,
some of you might question that.
You might say,
well

563
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:21.280
if you,
if you,

564
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:23.300
<v 1>okay,</v>

565
00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:26.340
<v 0>you go to a bar and you get paralytic drunk and you are,</v>

566
00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:30.710
and you then get behind the wheel of a car and you go home and you kill
somebody,

567
00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:35.180
drinking dies harm.
Why do you think mail would say to that?

568
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.280
I think Mel would say,
well,
that's a reason to,

569
00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:47.410
to penalize drunk driving but not drinking.
Right?

570
00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:50.500
So I think,
I think that's what he'd say to that.

571
00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:55.360
But so the first step is you,
you ask,

572
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:57.790
is there a harm to others?
If the answer's no,

573
00:39:57.791 --> 00:40:02.260
it's protected by the harm principle.
If the answer is yes,

574
00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.670
there's a harm to others,

575
00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:09.420
then you make a utilitarian calculation as to what's best for society.

576
00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:14.980
So if there's a harm to others,
then you make the utilitarian calculation.

577
00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:20.200
And that's why it's important to have good science.

578
00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:25.990
Because when you make the utilitarian calculation,

579
00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:31.660
you want to bring the best scientific knowledge to bear on making that

580
00:40:31.661 --> 00:40:36.130
calculation.
He doesn't trust majority opinion,
right?

581
00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:41.340
He wants to say free trade is better than protectionism.

582
00:40:41.381 --> 00:40:44.830
We now know that as a matter of economic science,

583
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:46.900
when he was riding,

584
00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:53.120
if somebody could come along and show that there's something other than free

585
00:40:53.121 --> 00:40:57.470
trade,
that would be even better,
then we would pick that.

586
00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:02.960
Okay.
So,
um,
it's not the case that he wants to say this is,

587
00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:07.580
you know,
infallible knowledge are known for all time.
But for the moment,

588
00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:12.730
the best scientific judgment when I'm writing this book on Liberty Male says,

589
00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:17.510
is that free tried,
maximizes utility.
So step one,
is there a harm?

590
00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:22.240
If no,
it's protected.
If yes,

591
00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:27.570
then you make the utilitarian calculation and then it's important to have good

592
00:41:28.181 --> 00:41:32.110
science behind you,
not majority opinion.
Right?

593
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:36.380
And that's freedom of speech is the pathway

594
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:42.440
from liberty too.
Utilitarian efficiency.

595
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:46.490
And that's why all good things go together in Mel's account.

596
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:51.970
And we can have this hunky dory synthesis of rights and utility.

597
00:41:57.350 --> 00:41:58.183
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

598
00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:59.870
<v 0>Right.
Right.</v>

599
00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:06.790
Now we're going to go more deeply into

600
00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:12.360
this question
on Wednesday,

601
00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:17.190
whether it is all Hunky Dory.
Um,
because you know,

602
00:42:17.191 --> 00:42:18.090
I've said now,
well,

603
00:42:18.091 --> 00:42:23.091
there's a two step test for determining harm and that makes sense and it makes

604
00:42:24.601 --> 00:42:26.520
the apparent contradiction go away.

605
00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:30.240
And I think it is the best reconstruction of what mill wanted to say,

606
00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:34.920
even though he could have said it more clearly if he had come out and done that.

607
00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:37.110
Um,
nonetheless,

608
00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:42.290
there's still the question of who gets to decide what counts as a relevant harm.

609
00:42:43.051 --> 00:42:45.750
I said,
you do the first,
the first stage is there harm,

610
00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:51.420
but just from the little example I gave of drunk and driving and drinking,

611
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:55.710
you can see that this might be problematic.

612
00:42:56.970 --> 00:43:01.080
One of the things I want to thank you to think about between non Wednesdays,

613
00:43:01.081 --> 00:43:04.710
some other examples such as prostitution.

614
00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:06.993
<v 1>MMM.</v>

615
00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.660
<v 0>Does that involve harm to others or not?</v>

616
00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:11.913
<v 1>MMM.</v>

617
00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:15.050
<v 0>Okay.
I don't want to answer that now.
Just think about it.</v>

618
00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.790
I want to ask you that on Wednesday.
