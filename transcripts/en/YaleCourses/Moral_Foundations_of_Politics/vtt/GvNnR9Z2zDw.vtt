1
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.280
We ended last time by talking about the sense in which champagnes page has

2
00:00:06.771 --> 00:00:09.440
competitive democracy is minimalist.

3
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.190
And I said that it is an important sense minimalist.

4
00:00:13.191 --> 00:00:17.750
It's linked to this idea of the competitive struggle for power and the eye.

5
00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:22.340
The notion that,
um,
turfing the rascals out is,

6
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.360
is um,
the sing quando on of democratic politics.

7
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.613
Um,

8
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.960
there's one respect in which even if this is a middle minimal requirement,

9
00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:37.520
it's nonetheless a very substantial minimal requirement.

10
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.130
So the,
the basic issue wise,
um,

11
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.930
is this conception of democracy to minimalist.
Um,

12
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.490
it is minimalist in,

13
00:00:48.491 --> 00:00:53.491
in an important sense in that it reduces democracy to this competitive struggle

14
00:00:54.161 --> 00:00:55.330
for the people's vote.

15
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.530
I said it's this one restrict in which is clearly is not minimalist,

16
00:00:59.531 --> 00:01:01.150
which is that if,

17
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.180
if one's expectation is as Huntington and others would come to argue later that

18
00:01:07.541 --> 00:01:10.870
we can call a democracy,
a country,
a democracy,

19
00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:14.440
until there've been two turnovers of overs of power.

20
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.270
That means the U S was not a democracy until 1840.

21
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.320
Um,
Japan has only recently become a democracy.

22
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.090
Countries like South Africa and not yet democracies or we can at least we can't

23
00:01:28.091 --> 00:01:29.770
say they are a,

24
00:01:29.771 --> 00:01:34.150
because we don't know what would happen if the ANC lost an election.

25
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.170
So minimalist,
not negligible.
And I think that,
uh,

26
00:01:38.171 --> 00:01:43.171
for those who complain that Shit Schumpeterian democracy is to minimalist shoe.

27
00:01:44.231 --> 00:01:48.610
I living in a country that doesn't have it.
Uh,
and you will find that,

28
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.050
uh,
that,
uh,
that minimal is indeed not negligible.

29
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.740
Still you might say that raises the question of what it is that we can

30
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.520
reasonably expect from democracy because most people typically expect more from

31
00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:11.920
democracy then just the turnover of government.

32
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.690
And if we,
if we go back to the large themes of this course,

33
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.710
um,

34
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.180
remember that when I introduced the subject of democracy and we looked at Plato

35
00:02:22.181 --> 00:02:25.790
and Tocqueville's critiques of it,
um,
we,

36
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.580
we really were left wondering,
well,
why,
why would anyone think that if,

37
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
if protecting individual rights and basing politics on scientific principles of

38
00:02:38.051 --> 00:02:42.940
truth is the,
is the answer,
why would we want it?

39
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.460
Why would we want to,
uh,

40
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.630
pursue democracy as the goal to achieving that answer?

41
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.950
Um,

42
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.390
but if you now take a step back and ask,

43
00:02:55.391 --> 00:02:56.224
well,

44
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.350
compared to what democracy starts look pretty good because what we have seen in

45
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:07.540
the literature on democracy is that,
um,

46
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.950
no other political system does a better job of protecting individual rights.

47
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:19.951
We saw that Madison was greatly concerned with the separation of power and the

48
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:21.550
creation of,

49
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.540
we might call Republican constraints on democracy,

50
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.880
but the literature from the 20th century has established principally by Bob
Doll,

51
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:35.210
but also from many others that if you look at,
if,

52
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.240
if you look at the addition of con judicial review is just not something that

53
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:41.650
lawyers like to hear.

54
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.510
But if you look at the addition of judicial review to democratic politics,

55
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.520
it doesn't really add anything.

56
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:53.521
That is to say the way in which empirically rights are best protected is by

57
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:56.920
creating Schumpeterian democracy.

58
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.400
Adding judicial review on top of that doesn't seem to make any difference as far

59
00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:07.120
as preserving individual rights is concerned.
Uh,

60
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:12.121
the big thing is to get and keep democracy not to get and keep judicial review.

61
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.111
And a,

62
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:19.111
I think that is reflected in the fact that a separation of powers at the end of

63
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.880
the day,
his words upon a parchment,
where's the,

64
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.850
the pluralism that guarantees competitive politics is embedded in the society.

65
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.210
And that is ultimately the guarantor of freedom under democratic conditions.

66
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.010
If we think about the truth coming out in politics basing Po,

67
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.420
finding a political system that as male would have,

68
00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:47.500
it could bash track the truth.
Um,
again,
what we've,

69
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.810
what we find when we ask the question compared to what democracy does better

70
00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:56.710
than the going alternatives.
Uh,

71
00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.720
you can think of Schumpeterian competition as institutionalizing mills demand

72
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.200
that,
um,
we have to have competition of ideas.

73
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.410
Remember how Mel got from freedom to a utility through his idea of the truth

74
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:19.150
coming out of competitive argument,
not deliberation,

75
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:22.990
not sitting around and contemplating things together,

76
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.190
but people having to argue for their views and defend them,
uh,

77
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:32.130
on the grounds that a,
they can meet the objections of their,
uh,

78
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.973
critics.

79
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.520
And so Schumpeterian ism is a kind of institutionalization of the,

80
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.170
the competitive argumentative ideal.
Uh,

81
00:05:44.171 --> 00:05:49.171
that mill talks about in the long chapter on freedom of speech in on liberty.

82
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.620
And so again,
when we say compared to what,
um,

83
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.800
democracy does better than the going alternatives in preserving the freedom of

84
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:04.571
speech and the competition of ideas that is likely to make the truth come out in

85
00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:07.160
the long run.
Uh,

86
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:10.910
so despite the fears of Plato and Tocqueville,

87
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.300
when we pose the question compared to what democracy does better than the going

88
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:21.851
alternatives in vindicating these enlightenment ideals,

89
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.470
as Churchill said,

90
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:29.030
democracy is the worst system of government except for the others that have been

91
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:33.560
tried from time to time.
Now you could,

92
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.700
you could,
uh,
by everything I've just said now,

93
00:06:37.701 --> 00:06:42.701
but still feel that this is too minimalistic conception of democracy to meet the

94
00:06:45.661 --> 00:06:50.661
sort of expectations that people have when they make demands for the creation of

95
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:53.930
democracy in the real world.

96
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.020
And I think there's merit to that objection.

97
00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:02.050
And these last two lectures are designed to address it to the extent that I

98
00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:04.430
think it's possible to address it.

99
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.240
If we think about the condition on conditions under which people demand

100
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.480
democracy,

101
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:17.050
they usually conditions under which people have a strong experience of

102
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:18.560
injustice.

103
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:24.220
So those of us who were around in the 1980s would hear objections from behind

104
00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:29.840
the iron curtain to communism.

105
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.790
People didn't like communism and what they demanded was democracy.

106
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:40.220
Or if you go to apartheid South Africa,
what you find is,

107
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.280
um,
again,
people find,

108
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:48.610
find themselves appalled by and rejecting of apartheid.

109
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:53.390
But what do they demand?
They demand democracy.
Now,

110
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.360
if in either of those interests instances,

111
00:07:56.361 --> 00:08:00.080
you went to those people who would dim,
who does anticommunist,

112
00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:03.860
who were demanding democracy in the former Soviet Union,

113
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:09.190
or the anti apartheid activists who were demanding democracy in South Africa.

114
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.340
Um,
and you said to them,
well,

115
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:18.400
tell us what a perfect democracy would look like in Russia or in South Africa.

116
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.400
They wouldn't have been able to tell you.

117
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.940
And I think that that's an important observation.

118
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:31.270
It's an important observation because it captures a feature of human nature that

119
00:08:32.331 --> 00:08:35.270
we haven't commented on very much.
Um,

120
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:40.280
although it came to the surface in our discussion of Mcintyre,
namely,

121
00:08:40.281 --> 00:08:43.250
that human beings are reactive creatures.

122
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:46.850
They shy away from what does not work.
Uh,

123
00:08:46.851 --> 00:08:51.680
and then fumble in the darkness in search of something that works better or at

124
00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:55.380
least something that fails less badly.

125
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:56.913
<v 1>Okay.</v>

126
00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:01.380
<v 0>The famous economist and Marty Sen,
uh,
how I mentioned to you briefly,</v>

127
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:06.030
I think made this point brilliantly in a new book of his called the idea of

128
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:11.031
justice and express some of his frustration with the academic literature on

129
00:09:11.581 --> 00:09:12.211
justice,

130
00:09:12.211 --> 00:09:17.211
which seems to get caught up in debating questions that are three points to the

131
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:19.730
right of the decimal,
uh,

132
00:09:19.731 --> 00:09:24.240
without moving on the big questions of justice.
And send said,

133
00:09:24.241 --> 00:09:27.930
imagine,
imagine that you were sitting in a sauna,

134
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:32.550
a and the controls for the sauna were outside so you couldn't reach them.

135
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:38.100
Um,
and it got hotter and hotter and hotter and you were really,
really hot.

136
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.550
And you said to the person,
uh,

137
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.570
who had their hand on the controls outside this one,
turn it down.

138
00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:49.680
It's way too hot.
And his reply was,
well,

139
00:09:49.681 --> 00:09:51.450
I'm not going to turn it down and tell you,

140
00:09:51.451 --> 00:09:56.130
tell me what the optimal tangent temperature is.
And of course,

141
00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:00.600
what sends point is you don't know what the optimal tenture temperature is.

142
00:10:00.601 --> 00:10:03.840
What you know is this is much too hot.
Um,

143
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.870
and so I think sends,

144
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:11.370
sends a little story in a more imaginative way then than anything I have come up

145
00:10:11.431 --> 00:10:11.880
with,

146
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.880
captures this idea that human beings are reactive creatures and we,

147
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:21.480
we,
we say,
this doesn't work.
This doesn't work.
This doesn't work.

148
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.920
And we constantly looking for something that does better.

149
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:31.490
And so the fact that anticommunist in the 1980s couldn't describe what a well

150
00:10:33.291 --> 00:10:37.320
functioning a post Soviet democracy would look like,

151
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:39.130
or the fact that,
uh,

152
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:44.170
anti apartheid activists in the 1970s and eighties couldn't characterize a

153
00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:48.090
democratic South Africa for you in any detail,

154
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:53.510
doesn't detract from the fact that their demands for democracy captured,

155
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:54.570
uh,

156
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:59.570
something about what they thought was fundamentally unacceptable about the

157
00:10:59.971 --> 00:11:03.060
existing state of affairs.
And so,
um,

158
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:08.090
people demand democracy because they experience injustice and they want justice

159
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.700
and they hope that democracy will deliver it.

160
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:15.973
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

161
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:19.000
<v 0>Now some shown per Tarion's Huntington,</v>

162
00:11:19.001 --> 00:11:23.070
a foremost among them have said,
this is really bad.

163
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:28.820
This is really a bad thing because what's going to happen when people experience

164
00:11:30.331 --> 00:11:35.331
injustice and demand democracy is there inevitably they are inevitably going to

165
00:11:37.411 --> 00:11:42.050
be disappointed.
Indeed.

166
00:11:42.051 --> 00:11:44.900
There was a very interesting poll I thought,
uh,

167
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.960
out of South Africa on this very point last year where they found a majority of

168
00:11:50.421 --> 00:11:55.421
South African blacks saying things were better under apartheid then now,

169
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.640
but then when asked would they rather go back to apartheid?

170
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.250
And majority said no,
uh,
captures,

171
00:12:06.251 --> 00:12:08.800
I think this tension in this paradoxical,

172
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.330
a expectation that people have of democracy,

173
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.560
but the hunting Tony and point was well,
uh,

174
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:18.730
that you wouldn't,

175
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:24.060
you would jeopardize democracy if you get people to load too many expectations

176
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.980
onto it.
The,

177
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:31.870
this to some extent is defined in the second half of that pole.
I just meant to,

178
00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:36.930
I just mentioned to you because even though people say things were better in,

179
00:12:37.471 --> 00:12:42.460
in the apartheid is they still don't want to go back there.
Um,
but,

180
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.010
but I think Huntington might say,
well,

181
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.530
eventually things are going to change.

182
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:52.710
Eventually when South African democracy fails to deliver on people's

183
00:12:53.351 --> 00:12:55.810
expectations about justice,

184
00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:00.370
the regime itself is going to become into jeopardy.

185
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:04.960
If you look at South Africa,
just to pursue this example,

186
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:09.850
we've now had four elections since apartheid.
Uh,

187
00:13:09.851 --> 00:13:13.810
South Africa's one of the most unequal countries in the world has one of the

188
00:13:13.811 --> 00:13:15.550
highest Jenny coefficients.

189
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:20.910
Yet the top marginal tax rate today is lower than it was at the end of

190
00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.250
apartheid.
There hasn't been land reform.

191
00:13:24.251 --> 00:13:29.251
There hasn't been significant redistribution of income or wealth because a being

192
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.040
the creation of a small black millionaire class,

193
00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:38.041
but for the vast majority of blacks there are still as badly off as they were

194
00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.660
before.

195
00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:46.020
And so the hunting Tonia and thought is that if people load expectations onto

196
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.570
democracy that can't be met,

197
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.320
then when those demar expectations are frustrated,

198
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.780
eventually the,
the,

199
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:59.950
the problem is going to be that people are going to blame democracy rather than

200
00:13:59.951 --> 00:14:04.510
the government of the day and turn on democracy when some,

201
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:08.590
a populous dictated comes along and promises,

202
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.440
say as we've seen in Zimbabwe,

203
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.890
a promises massive land redistribution,
uh,

204
00:14:14.891 --> 00:14:16.750
at the expense of democracy.

205
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:22.350
And so the modern Shump Ontarians have tended to say we should try and disabuse

206
00:14:24.491 --> 00:14:28.630
people of their unrealistic expectations of democracy,

207
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:29.770
um,

208
00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:34.770
so that we don't lose at least the minimal benefits of competitive democracy,

209
00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:38.650
which we've already agreed on,
not negligible.

210
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:42.550
And so that this was presented as a kind of realist,

211
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:47.910
a real politic take on a democracy that people shouldn't expect it to do to

212
00:14:49.841 --> 00:14:51.490
diminish injustice.

213
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:58.480
The problem with the Hunting Tony and view is that people are not going to

214
00:14:59.061 --> 00:15:03.590
change their expectations because some professor of political science tells them

215
00:15:03.591 --> 00:15:04.400
to,

216
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:09.400
there are deep seated reasons why people turn to democracy when they experience

217
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:13.050
injustice and,
uh,

218
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:18.070
and not going to give up on the appeal to democracy in order to remedy yet.

219
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.670
Um,
and those reasons have to do with,

220
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:26.630
I think with the,
the topic we ended at,

221
00:15:26.631 --> 00:15:30.020
at the very tail end of,
of,
uh,

222
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.940
last Wednesday's lecture is that democracy is motivated.

223
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.980
The impulse for democracy is,

224
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:41.570
comes from the impulse to resist domination.

225
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.960
And there's a connection between democracy and fighting injustice because both

226
00:15:47.331 --> 00:15:52.331
of those things are connected with resistance to domination.

227
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:58.070
So if we think that the,
um,

228
00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:03.210
shown per Tarion's up our right to say that democracy is often going to fail to

229
00:16:03.441 --> 00:16:07.190
deliver on the project of diminishing injustice,

230
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.210
but naive to think that people are therefore going to stop,

231
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:15.530
uh,
creating expectations of democracy,

232
00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:20.240
that creates a different kind of agenda that creates the agenda that I want to

233
00:16:20.241 --> 00:16:24.950
talk to you about for the rest of today's lecture and,
uh,

234
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.150
Wednesday's lecture.

235
00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:31.510
And that is how can we think about promoting justice by democratic means,

236
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:37.130
given that people are going to have expectations from democracy,

237
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:42.430
the better course is to try and find institutions that can deliver on those

238
00:16:43.191 --> 00:16:46.790
expectations.
And I think it's an important reason,

239
00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:49.400
not only when we reasoned about democracy,

240
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.820
but also when we reason about justice.

241
00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:58.580
Uh,
many years ago when I was teaching this course,
uh,

242
00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:02.090
before I had written democratic justice and indeed one of the,

243
00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:07.450
the events that caused me to ride it was a question from a student in the class.

244
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.790
Um,
I had gone,

245
00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:14.300
I had been teaching roles and I had gone through the principles,

246
00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:16.910
the difference principle and all of that.
And,

247
00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:21.911
and I had explained that rolls was the most influential political philosopher of

248
00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:26.540
his generation and that this theory of justice had completely revolution,

249
00:17:26.541 --> 00:17:31.160
arised a modern political philosophy.
And the student put up their hand and said,

250
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:36.440
Professor Shapiro,
now that rolls has theory has been established.

251
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:41.840
Why hasn't the constitution being changed to include it?

252
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:47.840
And many of the students in the class laughed and they laughed.

253
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:51.660
Why?
Why does have a guess?
Why do you think people laughed?

254
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.790
<v 2>Okay.</v>

255
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:58.620
<v 0>It seemed like a naive question.
Why though?
Why,
you know,
he said,
look,</v>

256
00:17:58.621 --> 00:18:01.350
you got the ride and John Ross got the answer.

257
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.310
So our Constitution doesn't reflect that answer.
Why haven't they changed it?

258
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.910
Why do you think students would have laughed?

259
00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.393
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

260
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:19.220
<v 3>people think there's a disconnect sometimes between political philosophy in</v>

261
00:18:19.221 --> 00:18:20.054
actual politics.

262
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:24.010
<v 0>Awesome.
They think there's a disconnect between political philosophy and actual</v>

263
00:18:24.011 --> 00:18:28.450
politics.
But why,
why is there a disconnect?
Um,

264
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:32.710
I mean,
these political philosophers are trying to get the right answer.

265
00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:37.570
So let's suppose it's true that role's got the right answer.

266
00:18:37.571 --> 00:18:41.680
And Nozick did intend to walk in,
didn't and,
and Shapiro data didn't,
you know,

267
00:18:41.681 --> 00:18:44.260
roles got the right answer.
He solved the problem.

268
00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.560
Why don't we just implemented this was after all what Bentham thought,

269
00:18:50.351 --> 00:18:51.340
you know,
when Bentham,

270
00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:55.630
Ben Fam thought he'd figured it all out and he went running around the world

271
00:18:55.631 --> 00:18:59.620
with his constitutions and was deeply disappointed when current countries

272
00:18:59.621 --> 00:19:03.670
wouldn't adopt them.
Why do we resist this idea?

273
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:09.790
Yeah.
At the back.
Can we get the microphone to the back?

274
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:13.793
<v 2>Okay.</v>

275
00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.980
<v 3>Because generally we don't think that claims are absolutely true and we</v>

276
00:19:17.981 --> 00:19:21.730
maintained that they can be,
um,
proved false in the future.

277
00:19:21.731 --> 00:19:23.290
Like claims are fallible.

278
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:24.440
<v 0>Okay.</v>

279
00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:29.220
So part of it is the Falabella some of the mature enlightenment that people,

280
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:34.640
people somehow resist the idea that anybody's got it perfectly right in the

281
00:19:35.011 --> 00:19:39.150
sense of getting a geometric proof.
Anything else?
Yeah.
Over here.

282
00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:46.790
Just,
just hold us.
Okay.
We want to record what you say for posterity.

283
00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:48.420
<v 2>Okay.</v>

284
00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.930
<v 3>Democratic system doesn't change that fast.
I mean,</v>

285
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:54.590
part of the nature of the system that we have is that it's slow moving and,
uh,

286
00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:59.180
<v 0>it's slow moving.
Yeah.
But still,
why shouldn't it move?
You know,</v>

287
00:19:59.181 --> 00:20:03.860
they had these,
the student might say,
uh,
well,
yeah,
okay.

288
00:20:03.861 --> 00:20:07.100
But you know,
so they had these ideas in the 18th century.

289
00:20:07.101 --> 00:20:10.790
Now Rawls has better ideas.
Why should we move to Ross has ideas.

290
00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:17.770
I think there's some thing that will make people resist.

291
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:24.420
There are many people who might concede that Rawls has a better argument than

292
00:20:24.421 --> 00:20:26.330
nosy d'ivoire.
Dworkin was Shapiro.

293
00:20:26.331 --> 00:20:30.630
Why will any of the other people mail that you've been reading and still want to

294
00:20:30.631 --> 00:20:35.631
say it shouldn't be imposed on the society that somehow principles of justice

295
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:43.250
have to be democratically legitimated in order for us to be forced to live by

296
00:20:44.791 --> 00:20:45.540
them.

297
00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:50.230
And so I think whether you start from the justice and uh,

298
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:55.470
we and your f you confronted by this reality that people demand democracy when

299
00:20:56.261 --> 00:21:01.210
they experience injustice or when you start from the democracy end,

300
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:04.740
you realize that,
um,
people,
ugh,

301
00:21:04.741 --> 00:21:09.130
not going to embrace principles of justice unless they can try them through

302
00:21:09.131 --> 00:21:12.340
democratic institutions.
Um,

303
00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:17.490
you realize that pursuing democracy and justice together is important.

304
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:22.720
After all,
as I said to you when I talked to you about Madison,

305
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:27.220
even though they thought they had designed the best constitution that they could

306
00:21:27.221 --> 00:21:32.090
agree to at the time,
uh,
nobody had any illusions that,

307
00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:37.100
that this would be acceptable if it had not been adopted by the people of the

308
00:21:37.601 --> 00:21:42.460
state of New York.
Um,
so having the right answer is not enough.

309
00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.560
You've got to have the right answer,

310
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:49.590
but convince people through democratic mechanisms that you've got the right

311
00:21:49.601 --> 00:21:50.434
answer.

312
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:54.850
So democracy and justice have to be pursued together.

313
00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:02.200
I said that the animating idea behind,
um,

314
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:07.000
democracy is the,
the appeal of resisting domination.

315
00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:11.480
But I think it,
the,
the procedural,
um,

316
00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:16.360
ground rule is what I'm going to call the principle of affected interests.

317
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:17.140
And,

318
00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:22.140
and this was no where better articulated than by Nelson Mandela in 1962 in his,

319
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:29.710
um,
statement to the court before sentencing.
Uh,
some,

320
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:33.160
a little piece of relevant background that you may not know.

321
00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:38.170
You have to write this down.
I will put it up.
I'll put it up on the,
uh,
server,

322
00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:43.520
uh,
piece of background is that they had been convicted of treason.
Um,

323
00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:47.380
the ANC had finally suspended,
uh,
had,
had,

324
00:22:47.381 --> 00:22:50.830
had finally suspended.
They're peaceful,
uh,

325
00:22:50.831 --> 00:22:55.120
opposition about five years earlier and turn to armed struggle.

326
00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:00.420
And then a number of ANC leaders had been arrested and tried and convicted of

327
00:23:00.611 --> 00:23:03.640
treason and their attorneys,
uh,

328
00:23:03.641 --> 00:23:07.180
told them that they were going to get the death sentence and the only way they

329
00:23:07.181 --> 00:23:12.181
could possibly avoid the death sentence was to get up and be contrite and beg to

330
00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:17.560
be led off.
And,
and the young Nelson Mandela said,
no,

331
00:23:17.561 --> 00:23:18.670
I'm not going to do that.

332
00:23:18.671 --> 00:23:23.440
And he stood up and he made this famous speech in which he said,

333
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:24.190
I'm,

334
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:29.190
I'm charged with inciting people to commit an offense by way of protest against

335
00:23:29.321 --> 00:23:30.154
the law.

336
00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:35.250
A law for which neither I or any of my people had any say in preparing.

337
00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:41.080
But in weighing up the decision as to the sentence which should be imposed for

338
00:23:41.081 --> 00:23:42.130
such an offense,

339
00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.310
the court must take into account the question of responsibility.

340
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:51.820
Whether it is I who is responsible or whether in fact a large measure of the

341
00:23:52.941 --> 00:23:57.170
responsibility does not lie on the shoulders of the government,

342
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.180
which promulgated that law.

343
00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:03.770
Knowing that my people who constitute the majority of the population of this

344
00:24:03.771 --> 00:24:06.500
country,
we're opposed to that law.

345
00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:11.530
And knowing further that every legal means of demonstrating that opposition had

346
00:24:12.471 --> 00:24:17.471
been closed to them by prior legislation and government administrative action.

347
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:24.490
We played no role in making the laws that affect us and we have no means of

348
00:24:25.851 --> 00:24:29.300
opposing the laws that affect us is what he was saying.

349
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:34.750
And that's why we turned to the arms struggle and it's not our,

350
00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:38.480
uh,
our failing.
They of course,
uh,

351
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:42.800
the government was calling them terrorists of course.
Uh,
why,

352
00:24:42.801 --> 00:24:46.390
what did they call them?
Terrorists.
But man,

353
00:24:46.391 --> 00:24:51.391
Dallas position was that the principle of affected anxious had been violated.

354
00:24:51.651 --> 00:24:56.651
This notion that I think is very close to the most fundamental prince procedural

355
00:24:58.491 --> 00:25:03.491
idea in democratic theory that people whose interests are affected by a decision

356
00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:09.470
presumptively should have some say in making that decision.

357
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:12.380
If you think about the Boston tea party,

358
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:16.550
which the current tea partiers are trying to piggyback piggyback on the

359
00:25:16.551 --> 00:25:21.170
legitimacy of it was the same notion.
No,

360
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.330
right?
No.

361
00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:30.580
What without representation?
No.
What?
Yes.

362
00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:34.590
Okay.
So it's the same idea that,

363
00:25:34.591 --> 00:25:39.130
that people who are affected by decisions,
if you're going to attack SAS,

364
00:25:39.131 --> 00:25:41.710
we want to be involved in,

365
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:46.090
we want to have representation in the decisions about taxation.

366
00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:51.610
And so,
uh,
it's,
it's trying to capture that idea,

367
00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.450
uh,

368
00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:57.450
that I'm talking about when I talk about democratic justice and I want to

369
00:25:57.941 --> 00:26:02.941
describe first a general argument and then some particulars.

370
00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:10.490
The first is that this rests on a broad conception of politics.

371
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.890
<v 2>Okay?</v>

372
00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:16.510
<v 0>Uh,
what do I mean by a broad conception of politics?
Well,</v>

373
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:21.100
consider this fact when we talk about,
uh,

374
00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:26.020
those of you who have read political philosophy in the history of the tradition

375
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:27.870
will know,
uh,

376
00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:33.310
that for most of the great theorists of the past,
um,

377
00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:39.480
the organization of the political system was only one piece of a theory of

378
00:26:39.731 --> 00:26:43.830
politics.
Plato,
Aristotle,
Locke Male,
uh,

379
00:26:43.831 --> 00:26:48.831
all of these thinkers thought that it was important to have a theory of family

380
00:26:49.771 --> 00:26:51.810
life,
a theory of education,

381
00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:56.310
a theory of how the whole society operated.
Um,

382
00:26:56.670 --> 00:27:01.410
politics is not just about what goes on in buildings in Washington and in

383
00:27:01.411 --> 00:27:05.820
Hartford.
Uh,
it was a broad conception of politics.

384
00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:07.103
Um,

385
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:12.890
and one of the criticisms of much contemporary political theory has been that it

386
00:27:13.081 --> 00:27:17.070
ignores
the broad,

387
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:21.060
the broad society.
So for example,
it was a,

388
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:26.460
it was a criticism made of roles as theory of justice by feminists that it

389
00:27:26.461 --> 00:27:30.180
ignored the structure of the family.
Um,

390
00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:35.400
roles talked about heads of households as the basic,
um,

391
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:41.520
uh,
representative individuals behind the veil of ignorance.

392
00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:45.580
And when he was saying that this was part of the basic,
the,

393
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.860
his theory was a theory of the basic structure of society.

394
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:53.070
Feminists,
theorists,
hutches,
Susan Okin,

395
00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.850
a now deceased and others made the argument,

396
00:27:56.851 --> 00:28:01.170
how can you say you're talking about the basic structure of society while

397
00:28:01.171 --> 00:28:06.171
ignoring the family and a roles eventually conceded the validity,

398
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:08.760
the validity of that criticism.

399
00:28:08.761 --> 00:28:13.500
And s came to say toward the end of his life that had he to do it over,

400
00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:15.060
he would have,

401
00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:20.240
he would have included the family as part of the basic structure of society.

402
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.040
So if politics is about power relations,

403
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:31.430
then presumably you should think about power relations wherever they occur in

404
00:28:31.441 --> 00:28:36.441
social life and not simply power relations as they occur in the political system

405
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.450
narrowly defined.

406
00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:44.450
And so the spirit of my argument for a democratic justice is to base to base it

407
00:28:45.601 --> 00:28:50.070
on a broad conception of politics rather than a narrow one.

408
00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:51.031
Of course,

409
00:28:51.031 --> 00:28:56.031
that doesn't mean that every political relationship is politicized relationship.

410
00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:02.750
We might say that the family is an intensely political institution and indeed,

411
00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:04.010
uh,

412
00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:09.010
debates about education and debates about abortion and the bay debates about

413
00:29:09.421 --> 00:29:14.421
many other subjects have politicized the family in recent times.

414
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.330
But in the 1950s,
it was not a politicized institution.

415
00:29:18.331 --> 00:29:21.600
It was seen as something beyond politics,
um,

416
00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:24.390
of no of no relevance to politic.

417
00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:28.080
So what institutions are politicized in that sense,

418
00:29:28.081 --> 00:29:33.081
subconscious us consciously conceived of as political is a separate question

419
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:37.320
from what institutions are in fact,
political.

420
00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:41.620
If we define political as involved in the,
um,

421
00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:43.460
<v 1>okay,</v>

422
00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:47.240
<v 0>in the reproduction of power,
relationships in the society.</v>

423
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:52.370
So we have a broad conception of politics.
And then secondly,

424
00:29:52.371 --> 00:29:56.090
we have a semi contextual argument.
And this is,

425
00:29:56.091 --> 00:30:01.091
this is to try and take account of what people like Mcintyre have argued that,

426
00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:03.223
um,

427
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:09.990
what people are willing to accept is largely conditioned by the,

428
00:30:09.991 --> 00:30:13.600
the social circumstances into which they are born,

429
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:17.530
the traditions that they find structuring their lives,

430
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:19.150
that uh,

431
00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:24.420
we have to take into account the context in which people find themselves,

432
00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:30.450
but there's more to life than just the context that is to say,

433
00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:36.000
um,
there are inherited traditions and practices,

434
00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.850
but as we reproduce them into the future,

435
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000
we have choices to make and we need principles to guide those choices.

436
00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.340
And so,
um,

437
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.870
the argument of democratic justice is that we do develop general principles of a

438
00:30:51.871 --> 00:30:55.230
sort,
but that semi contextual that is,

439
00:30:55.231 --> 00:31:00.231
they play themselves out differently in different historical circumstances and

440
00:31:00.601 --> 00:31:04.230
in different parts of the world.
Uh,

441
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.240
so you may for example,

442
00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:10.020
have an affirmation of the idea of um,

443
00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:11.650
<v 1>okay,</v>

444
00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:14.140
<v 0>non domination in family life,</v>

445
00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:18.640
but that's going to have to be worked out very differently in,

446
00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:23.790
in America in 2010 then it might've been in America in 1950.

447
00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:29.760
Not to mention in countries that have inherited polygamous systems of

448
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.390
traditional marriage,

449
00:31:31.391 --> 00:31:36.391
we're going to have to think in context sensitive ways about how to realize

450
00:31:36.641 --> 00:31:41.140
those general principles in the different circumstances.

451
00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.150
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

452
00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:48.090
<v 0>A third point,
and I apologize here,
I did,</v>

453
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:49.140
uh,

454
00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:54.140
swear off a impenetrable jargon at the beginning of this course and you might

455
00:31:54.211 --> 00:31:59.150
think,
uh,
talking about super ordinate and subordinate goods is,

456
00:31:59.151 --> 00:32:00.750
is the use of,
uh,

457
00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:04.380
not very user friendly terminology.

458
00:32:04.381 --> 00:32:07.590
But let me explain what I mean by this.

459
00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:11.310
If we take a broad conception of politics,

460
00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:16.170
one of the things that follows from it is that power relations are everywhere.

461
00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:20.520
Power infuses everything we do.

462
00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:22.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

463
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.910
<v 0>There's PR,
there are power relations in the family,</v>

464
00:32:24.911 --> 00:32:26.920
there are power relations in the workplace.

465
00:32:26.921 --> 00:32:29.140
There are power relations in sports teams.

466
00:32:29.141 --> 00:32:32.110
There are power relations in classrooms.

467
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.450
Power infuses everything.

468
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:40.080
This is of course an idea for which the French political commentator now

469
00:32:40.971 --> 00:32:45.971
deceased by the name of Fuko is famous for pointing out that power is

470
00:32:46.521 --> 00:32:50.120
everywhere.
But of course it's as old as the hills.

471
00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:54.740
Plato was of have the same view that power relations are everywhere.

472
00:32:54.741 --> 00:32:55.574
And indeed,

473
00:32:55.700 --> 00:33:00.260
the reason Plato affirmed a broad conception of politics was too,

474
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:05.290
he was because he recognized that power is exercised everywhere in the society.

475
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:09.470
And so,
uh,
if you,
if you,

476
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.680
the theory of politics is really a theory of power relations,

477
00:33:12.681 --> 00:33:16.910
it's going to have to track a pout wherever it goes.

478
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:22.010
So if power relations are ubiquitous and politics as ubiquitous,

479
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:25.370
then it seems like while everything is politics,

480
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:30.970
and it's that last phrase that I want to dissent from that last phrase in Fuko

481
00:33:32.601 --> 00:33:37.190
or in Plato that I want to descend from,
because in fact,

482
00:33:37.191 --> 00:33:41.060
what we really see is not that everything is power,

483
00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:45.560
but that power infuses everything and there's an important difference.

484
00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.400
Yes,
there are power relations in the classroom.

485
00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:53.270
Teaching fellow has certain kind of power over you.

486
00:33:53.271 --> 00:33:56.370
I have a certain kind of power over you.
Um,

487
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:59.900
but that's not the only thing that goes on in the classroom.

488
00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:03.980
Presumably also what goes on in the classroom is enlightenment.

489
00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:07.940
Uh,
not in the Big East sense of that enlightenment,

490
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:12.970
but enlightenment in the sense of communicating knowledge to you in the firm.

491
00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.330
Yes,
there are power relations in the firm.

492
00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:20.670
Managers have power over workers.
Um,

493
00:34:21.410 --> 00:34:25.850
shareholders have power of a manager's,
at least in certain circumstances.

494
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.760
Of course there are power relations in firms,

495
00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:34.880
but the exercise of power is not the only thing that goes on in firms.

496
00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:39.380
Uh,
there's the production of goods and services that goes on in,

497
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:42.290
in firms,
right?
Yes,

498
00:34:42.291 --> 00:34:46.430
there are power relations in sports teams manage.
Again,

499
00:34:46.431 --> 00:34:51.290
coaches have power over.
Players don't,
as you might say,

500
00:34:51.291 --> 00:34:56.150
have power over coaches,
even university presidents.

501
00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:57.920
Um,
sometimes,

502
00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:02.420
so of course there are power relations associated with sports teams,

503
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:06.290
but again,
sports teams are not just about power relations.

504
00:35:06.291 --> 00:35:10.700
There are also about playing sports.
Well,
so you can,

505
00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:15.050
as you can,
you can get the point from these examples.
We could go,
uh,

506
00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:20.030
everywhere,
uh,
through society and see,
yes,
uh,

507
00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:23.810
social relations,
uh,
often involve power,

508
00:35:23.811 --> 00:35:28.400
but that's not all they involve.
So to my way of thinking,

509
00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:33.610
the superordinate good is the playing excellent sport or communicate or

510
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:38.370
producing goods and services or communicating,
uh,

511
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.500
enlightenment to students.
Those are,

512
00:35:40.501 --> 00:35:45.330
there were super ordinate goods or what macintyre called the internal goods.

513
00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:48.150
Um,
when he was talking about his practices.

514
00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:51.990
Those are the superordinate goods that guide,
uh,

515
00:35:51.991 --> 00:35:56.130
our activities in different walks of life.
Um,

516
00:35:56.310 --> 00:36:00.420
the subordinate goods have to do with the power relations.

517
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:05.630
And what I want to say is that the goal of a democratic conception of justice

518
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:11.120
should be to democratize the subordinate relations as much as possible while

519
00:36:11.761 --> 00:36:15.960
interfering with the super ordinate goods as little as possible.

520
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:20.580
You at you at the end of the day want that sports team to be able to play the

521
00:36:20.581 --> 00:36:25.350
best football it can play or you want the students to learn as much as they can

522
00:36:25.351 --> 00:36:29.550
possibly learn well,
you want the firm to produce efficiently,

523
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:34.470
as efficiently as possible,
the goods and services that it produces,
right?

524
00:36:34.471 --> 00:36:38.970
So that those are the super on the ordinate goods.
However,
there are,

525
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:42.420
there is this fact about power being mixed up in the,

526
00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:47.640
in the pursuit of superordinate goods and democratic justice is about

527
00:36:47.641 --> 00:36:52.641
democratizing the power dimensions of human interaction while interfering with

528
00:36:53.551 --> 00:36:57.600
the non power dimensions as little as possible.

529
00:36:57.601 --> 00:37:02.070
And the creative challenge is to find ways to do that.

530
00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:08.090
And I think that when we're thinking about conditioning the subordinate

531
00:37:08.311 --> 00:37:11.070
dimensions democratically,

532
00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:16.220
they're really two dimensions of democratic justice that have both present in

533
00:37:16.831 --> 00:37:21.831
that famous quote from Nelson Mandela that I read to you a few moments ago,

534
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:27.930
what is the idea of collective self government?

535
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:33.320
It's the idea that as the principle of affected interests intimate,

536
00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:42.260
anyone who is affected by a decision should have a presumptive say in the making

537
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:48.270
of that decision doesn't necessarily mean everybody has an equal say.

538
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.280
We'll get to those issues later.

539
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:55.520
But everybody is presumed to have a say in the making of decisions that affect

540
00:37:56.491 --> 00:37:59.970
them.
No taxation without representation.

541
00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:03.120
It's the idea of collective self,
government.

542
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:05.760
If we're going to be affected by decisions,

543
00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.640
we should have a say in making them.

544
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:10.950
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

545
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:15.300
<v 0>But then separate from that and independent of it,</v>

546
00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:19.320
it's the idea of the legitimacy of opposition,

547
00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:24.660
the legitimacy of resisting decisions that you don't like.

548
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.960
And I think there are two reasons for this.

549
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.390
Forget about the presumption against hierarchy for a minute.

550
00:38:33.391 --> 00:38:34.650
I'll get to that shortly.

551
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:38.950
Just focus on the idea of institutionalizing opposition.

552
00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:44.830
There are two reasons for that.
One I've already alluded to today,

553
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:48.940
which is that we're always fumbling in the dark.

554
00:38:48.941 --> 00:38:53.770
We're always resisting things that haven't worked well in the past.

555
00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:55.720
We're trying to change things.

556
00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:59.500
We might be rebuilding the ship at sea as um,

557
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:04.720
as uh,
Devlin says,
but we are trying to rebuild the ship.

558
00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:09.960
We are trying to make things better as we reproduce them into the future.

559
00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:15.070
Um,
and unless we have the freedom to oppose the existing order,

560
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:16.800
then uh,

561
00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:20.500
the possibility of change becomes elusive.

562
00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:26.220
But a second and more fundamental reason that we should institutionalize rights

563
00:39:26.561 --> 00:39:31.561
of opposition is that you now know from taking this course that there are no

564
00:39:31.811 --> 00:39:36.460
perfect decision rules.
We saw that if we look,

565
00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:41.490
if we just focus on the arm's length types of transactions that characterize um,

566
00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:46.720
national level politics,
politics in buildings in Washington,

567
00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:51.640
we did end up with a presumption in favor of majority rule when we,

568
00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:55.430
when we worked our way through,
um,
the,

569
00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:59.000
the difficulties with Buchanan and telic and Brian Barry and,

570
00:39:59.001 --> 00:40:03.850
and ray and all of that,
um,
that,
that other things being equal,

571
00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.670
you protect yourself best with majority rule,

572
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:10.360
but it's not a perfect decision rule,
you know,

573
00:40:10.361 --> 00:40:15.361
from condo say and Kenneth Arrow that there is no perfect way to aggregate

574
00:40:16.331 --> 00:40:19.540
preferences into a social welfare function.

575
00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.960
So if there's no perfect decision rule,

576
00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:28.290
one of the things that follows from that is that whatever the decision rule,

577
00:40:29.411 --> 00:40:30.610
whatever the result,

578
00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:36.010
there are going to be people who object to it and who object to it legitimately

579
00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:41.590
people who are going to feel that their interests have not been taken adequate

580
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:43.360
[inaudible] into account.

581
00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:49.080
And so opposition is important for that reason to give people the possibility of

582
00:40:50.351 --> 00:40:53.110
trying to get things changed.

583
00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:58.450
Very important for the stability of democracy as well.

584
00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:03.250
Because if you don't create avenues for loyal opposition over time,

585
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:06.490
you're more likely to get this loyal opposition.

586
00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:10.330
If people feel there's no possibility of change,

587
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:14.890
they might as well reach for their guns.
So,

588
00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:15.973
um,

589
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:20.740
there are two dimensions of d of democratic justice for that reason.

590
00:41:20.741 --> 00:41:21.790
There's collective self,

591
00:41:21.791 --> 00:41:26.791
government and then this idea of institutionalizing opposition in practice.

592
00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:34.530
I suggest that one of the most important ways in which we institutionalize

593
00:41:34.881 --> 00:41:39.140
opposition is with a presumption against hierarchy.

594
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.700
If you think of the examples I just gave you,

595
00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:51.360
sports teams,
classes,
um,
firms,

596
00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:56.580
um,
you could think of many others,
armies,
um,
uh,

597
00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:01.110
families,
they're all hierarchical to a very considerable extent.

598
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:05.970
All those social forms are hierarchical and um,

599
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.970
often the hierarchy is,

600
00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:12.390
is essential to the realization of the superordinate.

601
00:42:12.391 --> 00:42:13.560
Good in question.

602
00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:19.350
So it's not the case that hierarchies unnecessarily bad,

603
00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:25.770
but it's when hierarchies atrophy into systems of domination that they become

604
00:42:26.741 --> 00:42:29.080
bad power corrupts.
And the,

605
00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:34.290
the problem is to prevent those who are higher up in hierarchies from,

606
00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:36.550
um,

607
00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:41.550
taking advantage of their hierarchical hierarchical authority in order to

608
00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:46.840
dominate others.

609
00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:51.960
And so when we confront hierarchical social arrangements,
there were a lot,

610
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.510
there are a number of questions that we can ask.
What I'm calling here,

611
00:42:55.690 --> 00:43:00.460
we can interrogate hierarchies.
We can ask is a hierarchy inevitable?

612
00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:01.893
Well,

613
00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:07.180
the hierarchy of a parent over a child is inevitable,

614
00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:12.660
but the hierarchy in say in the 1950s of a hundred husband over a wife was not

615
00:43:13.721 --> 00:43:17.290
inevitable.
If the hierarchy is inevitable,

616
00:43:17.291 --> 00:43:21.070
we're going to have to think about it in one way.
If it's not inevitable,

617
00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:23.500
we're going to think about it in a different way.

618
00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:30.210
Is the higher the degree of hierarchy appropriate children must be subordinated

619
00:43:31.361 --> 00:43:32.440
to their parents,

620
00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:36.940
but maybe they don't have to be subordinated for 18 years.

621
00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:42.580
We have the arguments of the children's rights movement that wanted to treat

622
00:43:42.581 --> 00:43:47.500
children as,
as miniature adults,
almost from infant hood.

623
00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:52.120
So we,
we have to think about is the hierarchy appropriate?

624
00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:57.010
Whose interest as the hierarchy serve?

625
00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:01.900
Is it really in the interests of the production of this super superordinate
good.

626
00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:07.290
Think of a boss who has hierarchical authority of our secretary and says to the

627
00:44:08.411 --> 00:44:11.200
secretary at some point,
uh,

628
00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:15.120
unless you are willing to go to bed with me,
you're gone.

629
00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:16.960
You're not going to get a promotion.

630
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.910
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

631
00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:23.910
<v 0>Then the hierarchical authority has atrophied into a system of domination</v>

632
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:25.750
because the,

633
00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:30.010
the efficiencies that would be gained from the boss having authority over his

634
00:44:30.011 --> 00:44:33.750
secretary of being perverted into,
uh,

635
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:38.370
something that operates in the interest of the boss perhaps.
Um,
but not,

636
00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:39.560
uh,
it,

637
00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:44.650
it doesn't serve the hierarchy as it was created.

638
00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:49.140
How fluid is a hierarchy is itself liquidating.

639
00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:54.180
If,
if you think of the situation where a child becomes a parent,

640
00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:58.440
my child becomes an adult,
that's a self liquidating hierarchy.

641
00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:03.680
Whereas if we go back to the 19th century and the father turned his daughter

642
00:45:04.531 --> 00:45:06.960
over to her husband,
uh,

643
00:45:06.961 --> 00:45:10.620
that would be a non south liquidating hierarchy.

644
00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:14.610
Is there vertical mobility within the hierarchy?

645
00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:20.160
Think of the debates in the Catholic Church about whether a woman can become a

646
00:45:20.161 --> 00:45:22.260
priest.
Um,

647
00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:28.070
there does seem there's not a lot of vertical mobility within that hierarchy.

648
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:32.040
Is the hierarchy symmetrical?

649
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:35.880
We think of the defense of polygamy,

650
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:40.910
but most societies that have polygamy allow a man to have many,

651
00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:44.790
a husband to have many wives but not a wife,

652
00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:46.410
to have many husband

653
00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:53.480
asymmetrical hierarchies are more suspect than symmetrical ones.

654
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:56.430
What are the opportunities for exit?

655
00:45:56.970 --> 00:46:01.020
Can people leave hierarchical social situations?

656
00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:06.240
You think about polygamy in uh,
South Africa.

657
00:46:06.241 --> 00:46:07.920
It's essentially elective.

658
00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:12.060
People can choose polygamous arrangements but they don't have to.

659
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:15.760
Whereas in some societies and fundamentalist cultures,

660
00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:19.470
polygamous marriage is enshrined in the legal system.

661
00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:23.010
Other things being equal.
Um,

662
00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:28.400
hierarchical systems are more suspect when the costs of exit or high for the

663
00:46:29.221 --> 00:46:33.810
people at the bottom.
How Angela is the hierarchy.

664
00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:38.570
For instance,
we look at the Amish.
It's a withdrawing sect.
Uh,

665
00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:41.910
they don't want to restructure the rest of the social order.

666
00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:47.330
So that is presumptively less suspect than a fundamentalist group that does want

667
00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:53.070
to restructure the social order.
So there,

668
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:54.630
there are all of these questions.

669
00:46:54.631 --> 00:46:58.620
One can ask about hierarchical social relationships.

670
00:46:58.621 --> 00:47:02.220
You have to ask them in a context sensitive fashion,

671
00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:07.460
and then you can get some answers that tell you what we should be trying to

672
00:47:08.131 --> 00:47:10.800
pursue in the name of democratic justice.

673
00:47:10.801 --> 00:47:14.550
And I will pick up with some of those answers on Wednesday.
