1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.820
An important transition.

2
00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:06.900
Today we're going to start talking about the social contract tradition.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.440
We've come a long way,
it's still only February,

4
00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:15.441
but you've really worked through two of the major enlightenment traditions of

5
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:18.850
thinking about political theory.
Two.

6
00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:21.960
To get into the social contract tradition,

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.820
we have to go back again to lock it.

8
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.860
We said kind of hovering presence throughout the whole course and locks idea of

9
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:31.530
workmanship,

10
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.560
which we thought about mainly in relation to creation of objects of value,

11
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:39.690
the theory of property in lock,
uh,

12
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.810
and how that plays itself out in,

13
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.790
in the labor theory of value developed by marks that we've been talking about

14
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.410
for some time,
uh,
over the past couple of weeks.
Well,

15
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:56.300
alongside the,
the uh,

16
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.950
economic of workmanship,
if you like,
that goes back to lock.

17
00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:06.840
There's a politics of workmanship because just as we own what we make in the

18
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:09.360
material sense in lock story,

19
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.080
we also own the political institutions that we create.

20
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.970
And if you cast your minds back to the early lectures I gave on the

21
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:22.920
enlightenment project,
um,
a big part of,
of,
um,

22
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.430
that claim was that we can have maker's knowledge of the political institutions

23
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:34.101
we create just as we have maker's knowledge of the economic social relations

24
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.360
that we create,
economic and social relations that we create.

25
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.900
And not only do we have maker's knowledge so we can have this kind of certainty

26
00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:47.520
the early enlightenment theorists were looking for,

27
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.770
but we also have makers authority over what we create.

28
00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:56.650
Remember I told you that Loc was engaged in this,
um,

29
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.900
debate with other natural law theorist in the 1660s,

30
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.420
where the big question was whether or not God is omnipotent.

31
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.100
Um,
and the question was then if you said God is omnipotent,

32
00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:18.360
it seemed to threaten the timelessness of natural law because he'd been a

33
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:23.040
position to change it.
Uh,
on the other hand,
if you said that,
uh,

34
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.070
God does not have the power to change natural law that seem to undermine his

35
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:31.390
omnipotence.
So either omniscient,
if,

36
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.330
I mean either the timelessness of natural law or the omnipotence of God.

37
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:38.370
But you seem like you couldn't have both.

38
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.030
And locks wrestled with this question his whole life.

39
00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:46.900
But in the end came down on what's sometimes called the voluntourist side that

40
00:02:46.901 --> 00:02:51.901
will dependent side decide which got them into the whole workmanship ideal.

41
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.160
So we know what we make and we own what we make because God gave us to be a able

42
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:05.611
to op the capacity to be able to operate as miniature gods and to operate,

43
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.470
uh,
in a godlike fashion,

44
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:13.471
creating a institutions and economic relationships and social relationships over

45
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:20.581
which we have the same kind of control with the caveat that we as God's

46
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:24.860
property,
we're bound by,
uh,
God's,
uh,

47
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.270
wishes,
which appeared to us as natural law.

48
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.400
Whereas in the things we create,

49
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.670
so long as we don't violate those constraints as assets,

50
00:03:34.671 --> 00:03:37.740
God's creatures,
um,
we,
we're not,
we,

51
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.120
we can do what we like and that,

52
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:45.121
that is the idea that informs Locke's argument in the second treaties where he

53
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:46.204
says,

54
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.153
<v 1>mmm,</v>

55
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.060
<v 0>to remind you,</v>

56
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.190
there's no earthly authority that can settle disputes about natural law.

57
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:58.000
And so it's,
it's every person for themself.
Uh,
if,

58
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.730
if there really isn't disagreement,
and I'll,

59
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.500
I'll come back to the implications of that more fully later when we talk about

60
00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:09.150
majority rule.
Um,
but the,

61
00:04:09.151 --> 00:04:13.990
the most important point to take away for right now is that we are constrained

62
00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:18.190
by natural law in the natural law tradition,
um,

63
00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:22.300
because with God's property and he has make us knowledge over his creation,

64
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:25.870
which we are,
but with the constraint,

65
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.520
well with the caveat that he rejects the traditional idea

66
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.340
<v 1>that,
uh,</v>

67
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.990
<v 0>he was arguing against filmer and others about that there's anybody,</v>

68
00:04:36.991 --> 00:04:41.490
whether it's the Pope or the king or anybody else who has the right to say what

69
00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:44.670
natural law means in the case of a dispute.

70
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.360
And that's the beginning of modern individualism for Loc

71
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:49.730
<v 1>that,
uh,</v>

72
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.520
<v 0>we are,
we're miniature.
God's on the one hand.
And yes,</v>

73
00:04:53.521 --> 00:04:55.320
we constrained by natural law,

74
00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.590
but it's not much of a constraint really because we're the ones who get to say,

75
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.263
<v 1>uh,</v>

76
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.410
<v 0>what natural law means in a disputed circumstance.</v>

77
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.060
Um,
so,
uh,

78
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.080
the individual comes into the center of thinking about politics now.

79
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.980
<v 1>Okay.</v>

80
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.060
<v 0>Um,
Nozick Robert Nozick is as a person,</v>

81
00:05:21.061 --> 00:05:26.061
we're going to use to ease our way into modern social contract theory.

82
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.970
In a way it's an odd choice because Nozick is actually a critic of John Rawls

83
00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:37.470
who are going to read next and probably wouldn't have even written the book that

84
00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:39.070
he wrote.
Um,

85
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.750
but for the existence of roles as book to which he was reacting.

86
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.120
But I'm choosing Nozick to do Nozick first,
but for pedagogical reasons,

87
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.330
one is because Nozick explicitly built off a lockin set of intuitions.

88
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.650
Uh,
and secondly,

89
00:05:55.651 --> 00:06:00.651
because his of the social contract is another variation of the reits utilities

90
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:07.070
synthesis that we looked at in connection with Mel.
But it's,

91
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:12.190
it's one that purports to solve the main problem that we were left within male,

92
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.270
which is the Marxian Critique of marks it market.
You know,
we,

93
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.670
we,
uh,
if you recall from the end of our discussion of marks,

94
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:27.671
we said that one of the things that is left untouched by all the problems with

95
00:06:27.981 --> 00:06:32.981
marks is Marxists critique of markets from the standpoint of the status quo,

96
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.280
the starting points problem,
the garbage in,

97
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:40.970
garbage out problem that that if you have,
uh,

98
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.900
an unjust status quo and then a lot of market transactions,

99
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:50.140
all those transactions are going to be infected by the injustice that goes into

100
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:51.500
this status quo.

101
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.610
If the corn dealer really is as starver of the poor,

102
00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.320
uh,
to use a male's example in the chapter on free speech,

103
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.280
Nozick thinks he has an answer to that.

104
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.640
Nozick thinks that he has a reformulation of the reits utilities synthesis that

105
00:07:12.351 --> 00:07:17.351
answers that problem and you will only get to how he thinks he had,

106
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.800
how he thinks.
He answers that problem next Monday.

107
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.100
But he thinks that he has an answer and in fact,

108
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:29.770
it's a brilliant answer and even those of you who don't like that answer are

109
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.780
going to find it very difficult to respond to nozicks point.

110
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:37.483
Um,

111
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.860
but before getting into the details of nozicks argument,

112
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.030
uh,
I think it's,

113
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:50.140
it's worth just pausing for a minute to notice two problems that any social

114
00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:55.970
contract theory has and has long been known to have,

115
00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:01.330
which anybody who tries to come up with a social contract theory has to deal

116
00:08:02.211 --> 00:08:03.680
with.
Um,

117
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:08.681
it's long been known first of all that because there never was an actual social

118
00:08:10.011 --> 00:08:10.844
contract,

119
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:16.480
that assumptions you make about natural men tend to be loaded with assumptions

120
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:23.480
about human beings from your own society.
This,

121
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.660
this critique is maybe not as old as the hills,

122
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.840
but it certainly as old as as Russo's critique of Hobbes writing in the 18th

123
00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:36.200
century Russo said,
the problem with Hobbes is Leviathan,

124
00:08:36.201 --> 00:08:39.980
which is another version of the social contract that we're not reading in this

125
00:08:39.981 --> 00:08:41.450
course.
Russo said,

126
00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:46.451
the problem with Leviathan is that Hobbes takes assumptions from the people of

127
00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:52.151
his own day and attributes them to natural man projects them on to the idea of

128
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.390
natural man.
And you can't do that.
And so we're,

129
00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:00.870
so his own version of the social contract is much more historical.

130
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:01.980
Um,
it,

131
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:07.010
it attempts to take account of the evolution of people from some kind of a pre,

132
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:14.900
almost pre human condition where to a condition in which social and political

133
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:19.830
relationships evolve.
Um,
but this,

134
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:24.720
this claim is made time and again,
when people talk about the social contract,

135
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:29.570
uh,
as,
as moving from a condition of,
um,

136
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:31.980
pre natural,

137
00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:36.450
pre political man to a social and political condition,

138
00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:37.890
people say,
well,

139
00:09:37.891 --> 00:09:41.850
the problem with it is Russo's problem with Hobbs.

140
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:47.120
That what people in fact do is take a set of assumptions about human beings that

141
00:09:47.941 --> 00:09:52.941
are the product of the society that's been created and attribute them to natural

142
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:58.710
man.
And so you get this problem that,
uh,

143
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.220
what you put into it is,
it's a,
it's a,

144
00:10:02.221 --> 00:10:05.970
it's a different but related kind of garbage in,
garbage out problem.

145
00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:10.680
The assumptions you make about human nature,
uh,

146
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.070
are,
are taken from,
uh,
the society.

147
00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:17.960
You want to justify a when in fact,
um,

148
00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.510
that and then you present them as,

149
00:10:21.511 --> 00:10:25.920
as though they weren't features of natural,
uh,
human nature,
uh,
of,

150
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:30.300
of pretty social,
if you like,
human nature.
And,

151
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.070
and so the argument goes,

152
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:37.280
what we now know from 200 years of anthropology's that actually Aristotle was

153
00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:41.790
right.
There never was a pre social condition.

154
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:46.791
Human beings are naturally social creatures and you can analyze them apart from

155
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:52.200
their social and cultural environment.
You just can't do it.
Uh,

156
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:57.201
anything you try to do in that general direction will be,

157
00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.433
um,

158
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.000
it will obscure more than it reveals.

159
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:08.420
You'll end up with a 10 dentures assumptions about human nature that will allow

160
00:11:09.601 --> 00:11:13.680
you to derive the conclusions that you want.
But at the end of the day,

161
00:11:13.681 --> 00:11:18.390
this is only going to persuade the people who agreed with you before you began.

162
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:22.500
And it's not going to convince the skeptics.
So what's the point?

163
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:28.830
So this is one problem that has long been known to attend social contract

164
00:11:28.831 --> 00:11:31.200
theory.
And,
um,

165
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:35.880
anybody who's gonna roll one out has to deal with it.

166
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:41.700
And what you find with the modern social contract theorists like Nozick and

167
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:46.440
roles is they say,
granted,

168
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:51.960
we don't disagree that there never was a social contract.
And indeed,

169
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:56.320
even if you look at the,
those of you who are students of American history,

170
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:57.490
well now,

171
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:02.610
even if you look at the social contract that came the closest to being an actual

172
00:12:02.951 --> 00:12:05.260
social contract equate as society,

173
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:10.570
namely the creation of the American republic,
even there,
um,

174
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.160
if you look up,
it didn't come about as the result of an agreement.

175
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:16.150
The,

176
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:21.040
the federal constitution was put in place in violation of the articles of

177
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:26.041
confederation and was largely imposed by the federalist horses who was stronger

178
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:33.550
than the anti federalist than the,
than the confederation forces.
So,

179
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:37.300
um,
even the American example,

180
00:12:37.301 --> 00:12:38.890
which is the one that inspires,

181
00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:42.880
knows book is not a case of a creation of a,

182
00:12:42.881 --> 00:12:46.060
of a society from whole cloth by agreement.

183
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.690
It's neither out of whole cloth because they were ready social and political

184
00:12:49.691 --> 00:12:54.691
arrangements before and it's not ready by agreement because it was imposed on

185
00:12:56.681 --> 00:13:01.270
those who didn't want it.
Pretty much by force.
Um,

186
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.960
we'll come back to the extent at which to which it was imposed later,

187
00:13:04.961 --> 00:13:08.470
but the basic fact remains.
Nozick knows all of that.

188
00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:12.820
He's not a fool and he's not ignorant.
But he says,

189
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:18.060
let's suppose society could be created by unanimous agreement,

190
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:22.330
could be created by consent.

191
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:29.510
What would it look like?
And we're not saying pre,
pre political,

192
00:13:29.511 --> 00:13:32.540
pre social beings,
people like you and me.

193
00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.610
If we were in a situation where there was no state,

194
00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:41.420
what kind of state,
if any,
would we create?

195
00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:45.470
And we'll see when we come to do John Rawls,
uh,

196
00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:50.970
after the break,
he has the same approach.
It's not an,

197
00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.980
it's not the people often get roles and Nozick wrong.

198
00:13:54.981 --> 00:13:57.590
They're not saying,
oh,
the,

199
00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:02.910
we can imagine what people would be like if a state didn't exist.
Uh,

200
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:07.670
in the sense that Hobbs data and locked it and resell criticized them,

201
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.600
uh,
for doing rather he's saying

202
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:18.220
you and me considering ourselves as we are.
If the state didn't exist,

203
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:22.180
what kind of state would we create?
We know it's a thought experiment.

204
00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:26.040
We know it's a hypothetical exercise.
Nonetheless,

205
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.780
if we can answer that question,

206
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.160
it gives us a standard by which we can compare existing institutions that didn't

207
00:14:36.131 --> 00:14:38.260
come about in that way.
Right.

208
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:41.860
From the standpoint of this normative ideal of consent,

209
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:46.450
what would people have chosen,
even though they never did choose?
It tells us,

210
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:50.620
uh,
something about existing institutions,

211
00:14:50.621 --> 00:14:54.770
namely those that are closest to what people would have chosen are better.

212
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:59.020
And those are further from what people would have chosen are worse.
So it's,

213
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:04.060
it's this search for a normative ideal based on an hypothetical contract.

214
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:08.180
Whereas Hobbes and Locke thought the state of nature,

215
00:15:08.181 --> 00:15:13.181
was it a condition that has had actually existed in the world and to which

216
00:15:13.251 --> 00:15:16.590
people could return?
Hobbes thought,
uh,

217
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:21.380
England during the civil war actually went into a state of nature lock thought

218
00:15:21.381 --> 00:15:22.270
much of numeric.

219
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:27.200
North America in the 17th century was in a state of nature.

220
00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.260
So it's a very different exercise in that sense.

221
00:15:30.261 --> 00:15:32.900
It's a hypothetical social contract,

222
00:15:32.901 --> 00:15:37.310
not an actual one designed to generate a normative standard,

223
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:42.580
a standard for evaluating institutions as they exist in the real world.

224
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.220
That's all.
So that's the first thing.

225
00:15:46.221 --> 00:15:51.110
You have to have an answer to this.
There never was a social contract critique.

226
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:56.270
And the answer of the modern social contracts theorists is,
yes,

227
00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.800
we know,
but it's still a useful hypothetical exercise.

228
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:07.600
The other problem than anyone rolling out a social contract theory has to

229
00:16:07.611 --> 00:16:12.611
address is that nobody really buys natural law arguments in the way that was

230
00:16:16.521 --> 00:16:18.050
often hoped that they would.

231
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:23.560
Now it's important to get clear about this because what we don't want to do is

232
00:16:23.871 --> 00:16:26.990
buy into a rather simplistic,

233
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:32.590
a comic strip version of the history of ideas that is sometimes shows up in

234
00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:37.700
textbooks.
The comic Strip version goes something like this,

235
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:43.240
while they used to be natural law theory and that solved the problem of where,

236
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:50.590
of how we get higher values for judging existing institutions.

237
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:55.930
But then along came the decline of Natural Law and secularism and we lost belief

238
00:16:57.081 --> 00:17:00.860
in natural law.
And so now,
um,
we,
we,

239
00:17:00.861 --> 00:17:05.030
everything's a sea of relativism.
You know,
once you start down that path,

240
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.370
you wind up with Stevenson,

241
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:12.140
you wind up with remember emotive ism and all that talked about it in relation

242
00:17:12.141 --> 00:17:16.550
to male.
Once you start down the path of rejecting natural law,

243
00:17:16.551 --> 00:17:20.810
you're going to wind up with extreme relativism.
And subjectivism,

244
00:17:20.811 --> 00:17:25.811
you're going to wind up with the idea that everybody's moral judgment is just as

245
00:17:28.191 --> 00:17:29.660
good as everybody else's.

246
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:34.820
And the problem with natural law theory is it's a throwback to this era when

247
00:17:34.821 --> 00:17:39.320
people believed in natural law.
And so,
uh,

248
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.190
you know,
now people don't and that's the problem.

249
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:47.420
And so how can you generate a natural law theory,
um,

250
00:17:47.421 --> 00:17:50.790
when most people don't.
The idea of natural law,

251
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:55.970
that's the cartoon strip story and the cartoon strip story has one very big

252
00:17:57.271 --> 00:17:58.170
problem with it,

253
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:03.030
which you are in a position to know about because of what we've read with

254
00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:04.590
respect to lock,

255
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:10.370
namely that there never was agreement on what natural law are required.

256
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:16.200
I talked to you about the d the disagreement between those who favored the

257
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:21.230
timeless universal conception of natural law and those who favored the so-called

258
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:26.400
voluntourist or workmanship theory that lock embraced.

259
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.220
But actually that's only the tip of the iceberg.

260
00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:34.610
You go and read a book like Richard Tux Book on many evil natural law theory.

261
00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:41.210
And what you'll discover is that in in the 16th and 15th,

262
00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:43.200
16th,
17th centuries,

263
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:48.450
the disagreements that they had within the national law tradition about
politics,

264
00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:52.800
we're just as extensive as the disagreements we have today.

265
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:58.070
That is to say you could find people defend a everything from what we think of

266
00:18:58.621 --> 00:19:02.700
today as the far left to everything that we think of today as the far right

267
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.040
within the ADM of a natural law.

268
00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.213
<v 1>MMM.</v>

269
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:12.870
<v 0>A natural law of vocabulary.
But there wasn't less disagreement,</v>

270
00:19:12.871 --> 00:19:14.910
there wasn't less political disagreement.

271
00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:20.010
There were huge political disagreements that led to enormous two civil wars to

272
00:19:20.011 --> 00:19:22.950
religious wars,
um,
in the,

273
00:19:22.951 --> 00:19:25.530
in the 16th and 17th centuries.

274
00:19:25.531 --> 00:19:30.210
So then notion that appealing to an actual law is some sort of

275
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:31.303
<v 1>mmm</v>

276
00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:36.710
<v 0>panacea and that the problem is that the world we've lost is a world in which</v>

277
00:19:36.711 --> 00:19:40.970
there was natural law doesn't get us anywhere because we know,

278
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:45.140
we know that natural law,
um,
whatever,
it's,

279
00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:50.320
its virtues and deficiencies is not something that can solve political

280
00:19:50.871 --> 00:19:52.850
disagreements.
As I said,

281
00:19:52.851 --> 00:19:57.851
there was a natural law theory that was compatible with every political position

282
00:19:58.641 --> 00:20:03.320
you could even imagine and many that you couldn't imagine,
uh,

283
00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:07.460
which existed if,
uh,
if you want.
Uh,
and he's,
uh,

284
00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:12.050
examples of that going read Christopher hills book called the world turned

285
00:20:12.051 --> 00:20:13.010
upside down,

286
00:20:13.011 --> 00:20:18.011
which is a book about ideas and political movements that got nowhere in the 17th

287
00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:20.540
century.
Um,
and you'll,

288
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:25.520
you'll see that a natural law,
uh,
could,
could be lined up with,

289
00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:29.420
with any,
any politics you could possibly imagine.

290
00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.020
Okay.
So that we don't want to,

291
00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:37.060
we don't want to say that the problem is that natural law used to constrain and

292
00:20:37.791 --> 00:20:41.630
now it doesn't because people agreed.
We know that they didn't.

293
00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:43.100
Nonetheless.

294
00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.250
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

295
00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:49.990
<v 0>That's still leaves the analytical that if they're going to be any constraints</v>

296
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.500
on what it is that people are,

297
00:20:53.501 --> 00:20:56.520
can agree to that and not simply the result.

298
00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:57.983
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

299
00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:04.170
<v 0>Of what we have.
We have found in the world,
they must come from somewhere.</v>

300
00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:10.340
And if you're going to roll out a natural law theory that doesn't depend upon,

301
00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.620
um,
natural law,

302
00:21:13.621 --> 00:21:18.570
you've got to find some other basis for doing it,
right?
I mean,

303
00:21:18.571 --> 00:21:23.190
just,
just to give you,
you one more example to underscore this,

304
00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.290
we saw that,
um,

305
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:31.400
that that inequalities among people.
You know,

306
00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:32.970
we talked about this Simon,

307
00:21:32.971 --> 00:21:36.120
we're going to talk about it more in connection with John Roles.

308
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.430
There are a big problem for us,
um,

309
00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:43.710
because why should some people get more than others just because they are

310
00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:47.760
smarter or more hardworking than others?
Right?

311
00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:49.340
If you're a lock in,

312
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:54.350
there's no problem with that proposition because if some people are more able to

313
00:21:56.011 --> 00:22:00.120
create things wealth than others,
it must've been part of God's plan,

314
00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:02.730
right?
Um,

315
00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:07.470
but why don't you secularize workmanship and chop off the idea of natural law

316
00:22:07.471 --> 00:22:09.090
and God's plan and all that.

317
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.140
Then you get into the sorts of problems we got into when we were dealing with

318
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.920
Marx's theory of exploitation.
Remember when we introduced the,

319
00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.840
these stay at home spouse and the,
and the,
uh,

320
00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:26.720
contributions of Sunday school teachers or anybody else to the creation of

321
00:22:27.301 --> 00:22:27.751
value.

322
00:22:27.751 --> 00:22:32.751
We got this over determined set of entitlements that didn't lead us anywhere.

323
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.820
So why don't you second arise,

324
00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:43.810
um,
workmanship it seems,
it seems to lead everywhere.
If you,

325
00:22:43.811 --> 00:22:46.380
you no longer have the constraint that lock had.

326
00:22:46.381 --> 00:22:51.381
Well this what we see here must be God's plan because this is how he created it.

327
00:22:51.391 --> 00:22:54.210
So what are you going to use instead?
That's the question.

328
00:22:54.211 --> 00:22:59.211
Why are you going to use instead of natural law and the modern social contract

329
00:23:00.931 --> 00:23:01.764
theorists,

330
00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:06.980
a pl two and 19th century German philosopher called Emmanuel Kant.

331
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:11.340
<v 2>Okay.</v>

332
00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:15.960
<v 0>18th and 19th century.
Thank her.
Who um,</v>

333
00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:22.250
came up with an idea that stands in for natural law

334
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:29.540
and that is the idea of

335
00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.630
white for it.
I,

336
00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:37.810
I told you people don't like to say in words of one syllable what can be setting

337
00:23:39.561 --> 00:23:44.561
what words of five universalize ability yearn a versa lies at bail at t nine

338
00:23:45.531 --> 00:23:50.450
syllable word.
And the,
the basic intuition here is the following.

339
00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:53.420
The basic intuition is

340
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.910
if you could choose something from every conceivable standpoint,

341
00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:04.150
then it has the force of a moral law.

342
00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:11.490
Anyone know what the philosophical term for this was?
That comment came up with,

343
00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:12.990
<v 2>yeah.</v>

344
00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:17.970
<v 0>Anyone who took a philosophy course.
Categorical imperative.</v>

345
00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:20.310
Okay,
so the idea was,

346
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.660
well,
why was it,
why was the categorical imperative contrasted with

347
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:34.160
<v 2>somebody?
Anyone know?</v>

348
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.510
<v 0>No,
no reason that you should,</v>

349
00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:44.900
the categorical imperative was contrasted with the hypothetical imperative and

350
00:24:44.941 --> 00:24:49.680
the idea of a hypothetical imperative was if then,
so you know,

351
00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.730
if you want your society to thrive,
don't create big government.

352
00:24:53.731 --> 00:24:55.290
That's a hypothetical imperative.

353
00:24:56.070 --> 00:25:01.070
Categorical imperative is don't create big government ever under any

354
00:25:01.231 --> 00:25:04.950
circumstance.
Okay.

355
00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:10.220
So the idea of a categorical imperative is that it's not dependent on an if then

356
00:25:10.951 --> 00:25:11.784
statement,

357
00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.333
<v 2>right?</v>

358
00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:20.980
<v 0>So that's the notion behind [inaudible] ethics that we should look for</v>

359
00:25:23.841 --> 00:25:28.400
propositions that we would affirm regardless of the consequences.

360
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:32.540
That's the notion of a categorical imperative.
Now,

361
00:25:32.541 --> 00:25:36.500
rolls goes into this in some detail and what its implications are for

362
00:25:36.501 --> 00:25:40.400
contemporary political theory,
and we'll talk about that after the break.

363
00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.800
Nozick just takes it for granted.

364
00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:47.270
And one of the reasons I'm starting with Nozick is I don't really want to dig

365
00:25:47.271 --> 00:25:51.170
into the question yet of whether and to what extent cons,

366
00:25:51.171 --> 00:25:55.940
ideas are applicable to contemporary politics.
Nozick says,
let's just take it,

367
00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:00.170
just try him out and see.
It's basically,
so you know,

368
00:26:00.171 --> 00:26:03.440
one of his slogans is Kantianism for people,

369
00:26:03.441 --> 00:26:06.850
utilitarianism for animals,
right?
That the,

370
00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.620
and the notion here is for human beings,

371
00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:14.750
this idea of respecting,
uh,
principles that can be a,

372
00:26:14.751 --> 00:26:19.580
from from every point of view that's kind of replace natural law.

373
00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:21.290
Okay.

374
00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:26.290
That's nozicks that's the move that Nozick makes since the move that roles makes

375
00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:27.500
as well.

376
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:33.800
Did anyone happen to know what the famous categorical imperative was?

377
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.350
The example that con gave

378
00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.073
<v 2>okay.</v>

379
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:43.770
<v 0>Of something that rises to this level of a categorical imperative is just merely</v>

380
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.700
hypothetical.
Well,

381
00:26:48.701 --> 00:26:53.701
the example he gave was always treat others as ends in themselves,

382
00:26:54.251 --> 00:26:58.220
not merely as means to your own ends.
Sometimes this,

383
00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:00.940
the bumper sticker for this is autonomy.

384
00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.780
Treat people as respect people's autonomy.

385
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:09.580
This is our rights piece of the rights.
Utility tends to synthesis,
right?

386
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:14.830
We s and he and cons view wise that is a proposition everybody would affirm

387
00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:20.200
regardless of the empirical consequences,

388
00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.140
regardless of what effects it has,

389
00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:28.410
you'll always say that no matter who you are that we should respect the autonomy

390
00:27:28.841 --> 00:27:33.230
about this,
uh,
understood in this way.
Uh,
yes,
we,

391
00:27:33.231 --> 00:27:35.890
we all have to use one another to some extent.

392
00:27:35.891 --> 00:27:39.440
He doesn't say never use people as means.

393
00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:44.310
Your Nancy says never use people exclusively as mainstay around ends.

394
00:27:44.311 --> 00:27:49.311
So that's his example and that's what Nozick takes over in his conception of

395
00:27:51.761 --> 00:27:56.000
individual liberty,
which he puts out there,
uh,

396
00:27:56.050 --> 00:28:00.520
right at the beginning of anarchy state and Utopia when he says there is no

397
00:28:00.521 --> 00:28:05.200
social entity where the good that undergo some sacrifice for its own good.

398
00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:07.780
They're are only individual people,

399
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:12.990
different individual people with their own individual lives using one of these

400
00:28:13.811 --> 00:28:18.130
people for the benefit of others uses him and benefits others.

401
00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:19.930
Nothing more.

402
00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:26.130
So is a strong libertarian stance identified with this Kantian or notion of

403
00:28:27.191 --> 00:28:29.830
respecting the autonomy of others?

404
00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:35.250
We can't use people for some greater God because then we're using them.

405
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:39.850
We are violating their rights.
And this is where Nozick is,

406
00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:41.080
is headed.

407
00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.940
And what he does is disarmingly simple

408
00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.850
and,
and easily dismissed.

409
00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.880
Then you make a mistake if you dismiss him because you'll your not say,

410
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:56.301
uh,

411
00:28:56.301 --> 00:29:01.301
what turns on some of his claims that turns out to be a very interesting and

412
00:29:02.961 --> 00:29:03.794
important.

413
00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:09.340
So what he does is he says,

414
00:29:09.341 --> 00:29:13.210
let's imagine there was no government.

415
00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.560
We're not talking about primitive people were talking about people like you and

416
00:29:17.561 --> 00:29:20.440
me.
Let's imagine there's no,
there was no government.

417
00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:23.800
What would happen?

418
00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:28.480
What would people do if there was no government?

419
00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:33.623
<v 2>Okay.</v>

420
00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:35.680
<v 0>And Nozick is aware,</v>

421
00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:42.130
he is aware that you could make different about that.

422
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:47.580
Like Hobbes makes the assumption and Leviathan that people will be so afraid of

423
00:29:48.911 --> 00:29:52.120
one another,
that they will try and kill it,
kill everybody around them.

424
00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:54.940
Then you'll get civil war.
That the,

425
00:29:55.540 --> 00:30:00.340
the fear that others are going to do something to you will be so great that,

426
00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:02.050
um,
unless you,

427
00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:05.410
unless you impose an authoritarian state on people,

428
00:30:05.411 --> 00:30:08.830
they're going to have a civil war and there's no,
there's no other possibility.

429
00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:13.390
And so by making the state of nature very benevolent,

430
00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:19.260
Locke thinks he's going a different way because by,
by making it malign,

431
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:22.690
it's easy for Hobbs to justify authoritarianism.
You know,

432
00:30:22.691 --> 00:30:26.980
the state of nature is so terrible that anyone would put up with

433
00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:33.910
and authoritarian system rather than the civil war in which life is solitary,

434
00:30:33.911 --> 00:30:38.500
poor,
nasty,
brutish,
and short as Hobbes put it in Leviathan.

435
00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.600
So Nozick says,
let's not do that.

436
00:30:40.601 --> 00:30:45.601
Let's go with Locke and let's make the state of nature relatively benign because

437
00:30:45.911 --> 00:30:48.250
it will make our argument more convincing.

438
00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:53.790
It'll make our argument more convincing because if you make the state of nature

439
00:30:54.071 --> 00:30:57.610
relatively benign,
it's harder to justify

440
00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:00.640
the creation of a state.

441
00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:05.670
And we want to make it hard for ourselves to justify the creation of a state

442
00:31:05.711 --> 00:31:10.540
because then it'll make our argument more convincing to skeptics,
right?

443
00:31:10.541 --> 00:31:14.560
So we want to make this intellectual problem is hard for ourselves as we

444
00:31:14.561 --> 00:31:15.580
possibly can.

445
00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:20.910
Now there's something of an intellectual slide of hand going on in this that I'm

446
00:31:20.911 --> 00:31:22.030
going to come back to,

447
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:27.250
but I'll just flag for right now that in the way he sets it up,
uh,

448
00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:32.080
he,
he says,
let's make it hard to derive a,
the idea of a state.

449
00:31:32.081 --> 00:31:34.000
So he says,
imagine,

450
00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.260
imagine a world in which there's no government.

451
00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.840
It's a hard thing for us to do.

452
00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:44.813
<v 2>Okay.</v>

453
00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.690
<v 0>Just,
just to make this real,</v>

454
00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:51.980
do you know when police were created,

455
00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:56.930
the first police force was created in Britain was before he,

456
00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:01.230
before here,
no reason.
You should.

457
00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.340
1830

458
00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.690
prime minister peel created the,

459
00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:10.620
the first police were called PLRs name for the prime minister.

460
00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.140
But imagine just you think about it.

461
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:18.430
Think about living in a world where there were no police.
I mean,

462
00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:23.150
it'd be a very,
very different world.
All right,
cool.
Uh,

463
00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:27.900
think about the w the ways in which,
just just in a day in new haven,

464
00:32:27.901 --> 00:32:32.820
the number of things that go on that is somehow affected by the hovering

465
00:32:32.821 --> 00:32:36.390
presence of police.
So that,
that's the kind of,

466
00:32:36.391 --> 00:32:40.150
and so Nozick wants you to do that in a more radical way.
Think that,

467
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:44.390
imagine what would,
what would happen if there was no government?
Uh,

468
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:47.063
well,

469
00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:56.720
it wouldn't be a very efficient circumstance

470
00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:00.123
even if

471
00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.900
we don't think that everyone would be out shopping one another,

472
00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.400
two pieces with machetes.

473
00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:11.640
It still wouldn't be a very efficient situation because everybody would be the

474
00:33:13.541 --> 00:33:18.310
enforcer of natural law themselves since the Lockian story,
as you know.

475
00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:23.680
Um,
so if I were in here lecturing to you,

476
00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.660
I'd have to worry,
you know,
maybe somebody,

477
00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:33.600
maybe somebody grabbing my car and making off with that.

478
00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:40.030
So I would have to,
you know,

479
00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:45.420
find some way to protect my car while I was sitting here doing this and problem.

480
00:33:46.061 --> 00:33:50.290
Maybe I could do it,
but it's kind of a very inefficient thing for me to do.

481
00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:55.510
Um,
and so how am I going to do that?
How,
how is,

482
00:33:55.570 --> 00:34:00.570
how is life going to go on if people can even know that their property is going

483
00:34:03.181 --> 00:34:06.370
to be protected?
Well,

484
00:34:06.371 --> 00:34:11.371
they're gonna form protective associations that Garneau say,

485
00:34:12.281 --> 00:34:15.760
okay,
I'm,
I'm gonna,
you know,
I'm going to say there was some colleague,

486
00:34:15.761 --> 00:34:16.594
I'll tell you what,

487
00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:21.370
you'll watch my car on Mondays and Wednesdays while I'm lecturing and I'll watch

488
00:34:21.371 --> 00:34:25.570
your car,
you know,
sort of block watch kind of idea.
Right?

489
00:34:25.571 --> 00:34:30.370
People are going to form associations to protect themselves and to protect their

490
00:34:30.371 --> 00:34:35.200
property because in the absence of that,
it's very inefficient.

491
00:34:35.201 --> 00:34:36.790
Highly inefficient system.

492
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:40.363
<v 2>Okay.</v>

493
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:45.220
<v 0>So you would imagine
they would,</v>

494
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:47.300
they would sort of be a,

495
00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:55.580
they would,
they would,
they would basically be like block watch,
but even that,

496
00:34:55.581 --> 00:34:56.031
you know,

497
00:34:56.031 --> 00:35:00.630
would be not particularly efficient because the truth is not only do I not want

498
00:35:00.631 --> 00:35:03.830
to watch my car on Mondays and Wednesdays,

499
00:35:03.831 --> 00:35:07.400
I don't really want to watch somebody else's car and Tuesdays and Thursdays

500
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:08.480
either.
Right?

501
00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:14.020
So what would happen is we would start to have a division of labor.

502
00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:20.860
We would start to have a situation in which we paid somebody to watch cars,

503
00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:26.150
right?
And that they would be sort of like little malicious.

504
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.460
They would,
um,

505
00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.310
the businesses that salt protection.

506
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:42.280
And so we,
you know,
you could imagine,
uh,

507
00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:47.830
a group of us joining wine association that promises to protect cars,

508
00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:53.740
but others would join a different association that promise to protect cars.

509
00:35:53.961 --> 00:35:54.201
You know,

510
00:35:54.201 --> 00:35:59.201
so we'd have the new haven business that sells carp protection,

511
00:36:00.761 --> 00:36:05.140
but we'd have the ham didn't one and we'd have the orange one and there would be

512
00:36:05.141 --> 00:36:08.650
these different businesses selling protection for people's cars.

513
00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:13.813
<v 2>Bye.</v>

514
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:16.743
<v 0>And this is</v>

515
00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:17.780
<v 2>okay.</v>

516
00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:22.730
<v 0>One of nozicks most important analytical claims with application to politics.</v>

517
00:36:22.731 --> 00:36:27.731
He says the thing about coercive force protection

518
00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:30.230
<v 2>yeah.</v>

519
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:32.450
<v 0>Is that it's a natural monopoly.</v>

520
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.300
What is he,
what do you think he might mean by that?

521
00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:42.220
<v 2>Anyone?
Okay.</v>

522
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:45.170
<v 0>Kind of an AI.
It's bringing an economist category.</v>

523
00:36:45.171 --> 00:36:48.920
Do you think about a noneconomic topic,

524
00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:52.250
but what do you think he might mean?
Anyone want to try?

525
00:36:52.251 --> 00:36:55.470
This might seem puzzling.

526
00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.850
Think about a country in which there are many malicious,

527
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:10.390
like Lebanon in the 1980s or Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union where

528
00:37:11.241 --> 00:37:15.290
you've got these organized crime syndicates more or less,

529
00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:19.880
or Chicago for that matter during the Hay Day of organized crime.

530
00:37:19.881 --> 00:37:24.881
What happens when you have multiple entities selling protection?

531
00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.720
Yeah.
I can take the microphone and say,
say,
yeah,

532
00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:42.060
<v 3>they start fighting with each other.
It's like,
okay,</v>

533
00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:44.990
<v 0>they start fighting with each other.
Why you're dead.
Right?</v>

534
00:37:44.991 --> 00:37:46.490
But why do they fight with each other?

535
00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:50.530
<v 3>It's like fighting over territory.
You know,
why territory,
what else?</v>

536
00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:53.620
If one member gets in a fight within member from someone now that from a

537
00:37:53.621 --> 00:37:56.680
different group,
they have to protect that member and sort of is the other group.

538
00:37:56.681 --> 00:37:58.690
So they have no other choice but to fight each other.

539
00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:02.070
<v 0>Exactly.
Right.
So,
uh,
I mean,</v>

540
00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:06.780
you just go and watch a movie like the Godfather,
Goodfellas or any of those.

541
00:38:06.781 --> 00:38:10.380
And you know what the dynamic is?
I say to you,
you know,

542
00:38:10.381 --> 00:38:15.270
you pay me protection money and I'll make sure you're taken care of.
But then,

543
00:38:15.271 --> 00:38:20.010
you know,
some bigger thug comes around the next day and says,
you know,

544
00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:24.180
you might think Shapiro can protect you,
but you know,
what do you think,
you know,

545
00:38:24.181 --> 00:38:28.770
that that went on?
The Yale Faculty can do for you?
Uh,
forget about it.

546
00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:32.340
Uh,
you're going to pay me.
And what's more,
you going to pay me much more.

547
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:35.070
And so that's kind of go on.
And how will it end

548
00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:43.210
generally?
What happens?
Yeah,
exactly.

549
00:38:43.211 --> 00:38:46.690
In civil wars,
somebody wins usually,

550
00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:51.610
or I'll say they drag on,
but eventually somebody wins.
Right?

551
00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:57.000
That's the claim about a natural monopoly of force.
That coercive,

552
00:38:57.590 --> 00:38:59.740
full coerce,
a forced to be a good,

553
00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:05.560
it has to be exercised as a monopoly for coercive force to be a good,

554
00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:10.860
it has to be exercised as a monopoly and that's one claim Nozick wants to make.

555
00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:14.290
<v 2>Okay.</v>

556
00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:16.750
<v 0>And the other one,
which is just as important</v>

557
00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:21.710
is it is the only natural monopoly.

558
00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:27.080
Coercive force is a natural monopoly where we unpack that to say,

559
00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:29.420
in order for it to be a good,

560
00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:34.820
it has to be exercised as a monopoly and there's no other

561
00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:39.630
natural monopoly.

562
00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:50.150
This morning I,
when I was coming in,
Glenn back was complaining.

563
00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:52.010
How many of you know who Glen back yet?

564
00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:52.913
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

565
00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:59.280
<v 0>Who's,
who does it?
Who wants it?
Who's clammed back?
How many you want to tell us?</v>

566
00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:00.123
It was Glenn Beck.

567
00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:07.550
<v 2>Okay.
Anybody?
Yeah,</v>

568
00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:13.380
<v 0>he's a conservative talk show hosts.
And it just a social commentator in general.</v>

569
00:40:13.381 --> 00:40:18.381
He's a conservative talk show host and social commentator who sees himself as

570
00:40:19.201 --> 00:40:24.201
kind of disciplining the Republican party to keep it close to what he sees as

571
00:40:24.961 --> 00:40:29.961
conservative principles that are defined in a strongly libertarian way.

572
00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.540
And so what was his complaint this morning?

573
00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.780
His complaint was that Mike Huckabee,

574
00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:38.250
<v 2>okay.</v>

575
00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:42.780
<v 0>Had Michelle Obama on his show or oil or data,</v>

576
00:40:42.781 --> 00:40:47.781
some event with Michelle Obama agreeing with Michelle Obama that obesity is a

577
00:40:48.961 --> 00:40:51.570
big problem in America.
And he said,

578
00:40:51.571 --> 00:40:55.080
how damn Mike Huckabee do that?
Of course,

579
00:40:55.081 --> 00:40:58.200
obesity is a big problem in America,
but

580
00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:00.200
<v 2>okay,</v>

581
00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.860
<v 0>that doesn't mean it's an invitation for the government to get involved in</v>

582
00:41:03.861 --> 00:41:08.390
stopping obesity.
The government should only do one thing,

583
00:41:08.391 --> 00:41:13.150
protect us from the bad guys.
Okay.

584
00:41:13.151 --> 00:41:17.980
In that sense,
he was,
he's probably never heard of Nozick and,
and,

585
00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:19.930
and all of nozicks argument,

586
00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:25.170
but he was embracing this idea that coercive force is the only natural monopoly.

587
00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:30.820
Okay.
So,

588
00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:33.793
<v 2>okay.
Yeah.</v>

589
00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:39.690
<v 0>Nozick wants to say,
if we'd go back into a thought experiment,
he was,</v>

590
00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:44.310
he wants to say,
because coercive force is a natural monopoly,

591
00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:48.420
somebody going to win.
They're going to eat a,
you know,

592
00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:53.480
buy up the other protective associations or defeat them,

593
00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:56.310
wipe them out.

594
00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:58.500
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

595
00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:03.420
<v 0>Right.
Or marginalize them,
make them irrelevant.</v>

596
00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:06.720
Um,
by being so,

597
00:42:06.721 --> 00:42:11.190
so much more powerful that nobody pays attention to them.
So in effect,

598
00:42:11.191 --> 00:42:15.960
you're then going to have one dominant protective association,
right.

599
00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:25.033
<v 2>Okay.</v>

600
00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:32.790
<v 0>Once you have one dominant protective association,
it's something pretty,</v>

601
00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:34.650
pretty much like a government,

602
00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:46.630
but still they're going to be some people who don't recognize it.

603
00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:52.150
And these are the people that Nozick calls independence

604
00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:02.230
and the nos expends a lot of time discussing these people.

605
00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:07.320
And you might think why there's this very long and difficult to understand

606
00:43:07.871 --> 00:43:12.100
chapter on the incorporation of independence into his system.

607
00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.280
And you will,

608
00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:19.480
you will find it confusing to read and you'll think there's something wrong with

609
00:43:19.481 --> 00:43:24.460
you that you can't follow it.
Actually,
the conf,
even though most of what knows,

610
00:43:24.461 --> 00:43:28.540
his rights is extremely clear.
That confusion is nozicks.
Um,

611
00:43:28.541 --> 00:43:31.150
so you shouldn't beat yourself up too much.
And I'm going to,

612
00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:34.290
I'm going to unpack it in more detail on Wednesday,
what he,

613
00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.650
what he's saying and why it matters.
Um,

614
00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:39.490
but this is the basic intuition.

615
00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:45.640
He has to worry about independence for two reasons.
One is,

616
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:48.910
um,
just to complete his account of the,

617
00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:51.010
how the government would form,

618
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:56.670
but the other one is normative because remember that the social contract

619
00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.780
argument depends on the idea of consent.

620
00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:07.410
Remember we said you'd utilitarian tradition is maximizing happiness.

621
00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:11.170
The Marxian tradition is about ending exploitation.

622
00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:16.240
The social contract tradition is about consent as the basis for political

623
00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:17.193
legitimacy.

624
00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:22.890
So even if the holes story about the force being a natural monopoly is correct,

625
00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:29.770
there's still going to be sort of,
you know,

626
00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:34.860
looney principled south there who don't recognize the legitimacy of the state.

627
00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:42.080
You have to worry about Nozick writing in 1974 isn't thinking about the sorts of

628
00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:48.810
people were thinking about today,
um,
in this connection.

629
00:44:48.811 --> 00:44:51.930
And so he talks about,
um,
you know,

630
00:44:51.931 --> 00:44:54.630
some anarchist wandering around,
uh,

631
00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:58.660
who wants to protect their own rights.
Um,

632
00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:03.330
and it,
it has something of a contrived quality to it in his discussion.

633
00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:08.660
But think about when you read independent think Osama bin Ladin or the,

634
00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:11.880
or the,
uh,

635
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:17.400
Mr Stack who flew his plane into the IRS building the other day.

636
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:21.690
These are nozicks independence.
These people,
they say,

637
00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:26.370
we don't recognize the legitimacy of your state.

638
00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:30.960
We don't recognize what you were,
you,

639
00:45:30.961 --> 00:45:34.320
your protective association,
we're not going to accept it.

640
00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:42.550
These people are a big problem for Nozick.
And he says,
as I said,

641
00:45:42.551 --> 00:45:47.320
both as a,
as a sort of empirical theoretical matter.

642
00:45:47.321 --> 00:45:49.030
He's saying what,
you know,

643
00:45:49.031 --> 00:45:52.960
what would happen with these people but then as a normative matter as well.

644
00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:56.140
So He's,
so what is he,

645
00:45:56.170 --> 00:46:00.280
what is his point about compensation and all of that?

646
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:04.150
Um,
I'm going to dig into that on Wednesday.

647
00:46:04.151 --> 00:46:08.290
I'm just going to tell you now briefly,
cause we're out of time.
What happens?

648
00:46:08.291 --> 00:46:08.630
He's,

649
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:13.030
he's getting basically say these people are going to be forcibly incorporated

650
00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:14.440
into the social order.

651
00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:16.490
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

652
00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:21.490
<v 0>And the theory of compensation is an account of what makes that enforceable</v>

653
00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:26.420
incorporation legitimate.
And I'll dig into that on Wednesday.

654
00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:33.200
Okay.
We're out of time now,
so we'll pick up with that.
Uh,
right at the beginning.

655
00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:34.160
Cheers.
