1
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.730
So today we're going to finish up talking about Nozick.
Um,

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.320
and that will give you time to just spend your spring break reading roles,

3
00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:14.820
which is,
I know,
which is,
I know what you will all do.
Um,

4
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.780
but I want to come back to something I mentioned briefly about Nozick and just

5
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.370
reiterate that he thinks that in order to have a convincing account of justice,

6
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.450
it really has to have three components.
One,

7
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.050
when he calls justice in acquisition to what he calls justice in transfer and

8
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:46.251
three what he refers to as the rectification of past injustices.

9
00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:49.110
You need accounts of all of those things,

10
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.860
how people got to have what they have.

11
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.750
<v 1>Okay,</v>

12
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.570
<v 0>what should govern transactions among them.</v>

13
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.470
And then what should you do about past injustices?

14
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.860
And actually in what we've done already,
you,

15
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.780
you've got the main components of his account in front of you or in your notes

16
00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:14.010
from last week because,
um,

17
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.170
his theory of justice in acquisition is a theory that's intended to respond to

18
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:29.031
the left critique of markets that I'm going to talk about shortly is theory of

19
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.850
justice in transfer is the parade.
Oh system.

20
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.810
And his theory of the rectification of past injustices is a discussion of

21
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:43.890
compensation that we had last time.
So

22
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.340
let's think first about this idea of justice in acquisition.

23
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.320
What he has in mind here is the left critique of markets.

24
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.590
What he has in mind is the garbage in garbage out phenomenon that the parade,

25
00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:05.921
oh principle is a purely procedural principle that takes for granted some status

26
00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:11.691
quo or we worked through this with the bag lady and Trump and all of that when

27
00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:14.460
we did the parade [inaudible] system.

28
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.450
And he has actually an ingenious answer to this critique and he uses as its way

29
00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:26.550
into it that well,
Chamberlain example,

30
00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:31.040
anybody remember what Nozick says about wealth?

31
00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:33.870
Chamberlain who was well Chamberlain,

32
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.600
it was well chamber.
Yeah,

33
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.160
he was the best basketball player in the world until Michael Jordan came along

34
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.520
right?
Until Larry Byrd came along.
Okay.

35
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.710
Well,
fortunately Nozick didn't have to adjudicate that one.
Okay.

36
00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.070
Um,
and so Nozick says,
you know,

37
00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.540
um,
chamber is making a contract with,

38
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.070
with the owner of a team just like professional players do,

39
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.990
but this,
this contract has a side agreement to it.

40
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.920
Um,
anyone to remember what the side agreement was.
What was the

41
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.780
<v 2>agreement?
Anybody.
Yeah.
Over there</v>

42
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.180
<v 3>wasn't it?
That um,</v>

43
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.530
will Chamberlain gets a quarter of every dollar that the team gets in ticket

44
00:03:33.531 --> 00:03:34.364
sales.

45
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.950
<v 0>Exactly right.
So,</v>

46
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.680
so on nights when wealth Chamberlain is playing in a home game that the ticket

47
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:47.191
price goes up by a quarter and that quarter literally gets dropped into a box

48
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:51.940
and gets given to welt.
Okay.
And

49
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.980
apart from that,
his,
his um,
agreement,
it's like any other contract.

50
00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:03.390
So obviously his agreement with the team owner is a typical,
um,

51
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.470
play his agreement and it's a Pareto superior transaction and there's no

52
00:04:07.471 --> 00:04:12.240
question about that.
But the reason well

53
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.710
Chamberlain gets this quarter is because he's a charismatic figure and everybody

54
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.360
wants to see him.
What do you,
why do you think,
what is,

55
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.960
where does Nozick doing here?
What is the point of this?

56
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.550
What's he trying to show us?

57
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.773
<v 2>Anyone want to,</v>

58
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.800
<v 0>it's not immediately obvious,</v>

59
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.920
<v 2>but it's,
it's quite brilliant.</v>

60
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.420
<v 0>So here's the point.
The point is over time,</v>

61
00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.740
well it's going to get a lot of money from these corridors cause he's the best

62
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.490
basketball player,
basketball player in the world.
And people want to see him,

63
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.740
there's going to get richer and richer and richer.

64
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.693
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

65
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.360
<v 0>And so maybe let's say after five seasons of this,</v>

66
00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.530
he has millions of dollars and these corridors that have accumulated,

67
00:05:18.531 --> 00:05:23.090
the people have been put in this quarter in the little box that goes to,
well

68
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:25.543
millions.

69
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.140
Why is this a good example?

70
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.440
<v 2>Well knows what's what.
Yeah,
yeah.
But</v>

71
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.800
yeah,
over that.
Yeah.

72
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.380
<v 3>Well perhaps he's showing that even though this isn't an egalitarian</v>

73
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.510
distribution of wealth,

74
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.770
it's a mutually agreed upon by all parties involved.
So it's okay.

75
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.030
<v 0>Okay.
So paredo superior transactions,</v>

76
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.680
just every time you put that quarter in that slot,

77
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.330
you make it voluntary choice and he makes a voluntary choice to come out and

78
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:11.760
play and maybe smile at you or something.
Uh,

79
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.710
and you both both kill you tell,
and he goes up.
So it's,
it's in that sense,

80
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:19.610
just like any other Paredo superior transaction.
So,

81
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:23.150
so why the whole rigamarole?
What,
what else?

82
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.320
What else follows from this example.

83
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.450
Think back.
Think back to the,
what is his real target here?

84
00:06:38.451 --> 00:06:42.110
His real target is the left critique of markets,

85
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:46.460
which says if you start out with unjust initial conditions,

86
00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.780
right?
If your system of justice in acquisition isn't Matt,

87
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.980
then it doesn't matter whether your transfers are voluntary.

88
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.910
So what what's he doing here?
What's the point of this example?

89
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:07.773
Thank you.

90
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.410
Anyone want to have a,
have a go at it?
Yeah.

91
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.950
<v 4>That what we consider an unjust,
um,</v>

92
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:20.500
<v 1>yeah,</v>

93
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.120
<v 4>system.
Uh,
or,
and,</v>

94
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.560
and just distribution of goods.

95
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.040
Therewell may actually result from what was originally adjust distribution.

96
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.133
<v 0>Correct.</v>

97
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:36.480
His bumper sticker is liberty upset patterns,

98
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:41.830
liberty upsets patterns.
This is his point.
He's saying,
look,
you know,

99
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:46.630
everybody gets so excited about the unjust initial conditions problem.

100
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.190
I'll tell you why.

101
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:54.150
I don't know what just initial conditions are,
have no idea.
I Robert Nozick,

102
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.260
you pick your an egalitarian fine.

103
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.300
Start with pure equality.

104
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.530
You believe in meritocracy,
fine.

105
00:08:04.531 --> 00:08:09.480
Start with a meritocratic distribution.
You pick,
we,
I really don't care.

106
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:14.040
Okay,
let,
so let's,
for the sake of argument,
just say you're an egalitarian.

107
00:08:14.041 --> 00:08:17.790
So you pick it,
gala equality,

108
00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:21.390
strict equality,
everybody starts off with the same amount.

109
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:26.880
Now we're going to allow voluntary transactions.
You know what's going to happen.

110
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:31.530
You're going to get any quality because some people are going to put a quarter

111
00:08:31.531 --> 00:08:33.240
in the slot to see,
well Chamberlain,

112
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:37.500
so this,

113
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.920
this staff about the big problem with markets is that the problem of starting

114
00:08:44.101 --> 00:08:48.600
points,
the problem of initial condition,
it's just a red herring.
It's a sideshow.

115
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:53.100
It's bunk because in fact,
even if you,

116
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.860
you pick so your,

117
00:08:56.861 --> 00:09:00.480
you're the egalitarian just for the sake of argument and you pick

118
00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.900
this starting point that you are convinced is just,

119
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:09.800
and we allow markets to run.
It's going to be undone,

120
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.810
Josh,
by the voluntary choices of individuals.

121
00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:19.400
And so I'm raw.
I Robert Nozick say to you,

122
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:21.950
we'll have a little sip syllogism.

123
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:27.170
If we have just initial conditions and voluntary transfers,

124
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.170
then the outcome must be considered just

125
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:36.380
that's nozicks little syllogism you have just initial conditions and voluntary

126
00:09:36.381 --> 00:09:39.650
transfers.
Then the outcome must be just,

127
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.920
it's just a shell game to get all hung up on the initial conditions.

128
00:09:45.921 --> 00:09:47.330
However,
because

129
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:53.180
you can pick them and we're still going to undo what you like.
So you,

130
00:09:53.181 --> 00:09:55.550
the Egalitarian,
pick them people,

131
00:09:55.551 --> 00:09:57.680
go to the basketball games and what do you know?

132
00:09:57.681 --> 00:10:00.650
Five years later you have a lot of inequality.

133
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And then the only way you can co you can fix it is coercion.

134
00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:13.970
The only way you can fix it is taking some of that away from Chamberlain in the

135
00:10:13.971 --> 00:10:18.971
form of taxes and giving it back to those people in the form of some sort of

136
00:10:20.361 --> 00:10:24.350
transfer payment.
And that violates his freedom,

137
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.590
uses him to benefit them.
Nothing else.

138
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:34.010
So liberty upsets pattern.
What when he talks about a pattern,

139
00:10:34.011 --> 00:10:38.750
conception of justice,
it's one way you specify some distribution,

140
00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:43.750
whether it's strict equality,
whether it's,
you know,

141
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.400
Bentham's practical equality,
uh,
whether it's um,

142
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:50.420
some other distributed system,

143
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:55.810
whether you specify in advance what the outcome is he saying that's a pattern

144
00:10:57.231 --> 00:10:59.720
conception.
And the problem with it,

145
00:10:59.721 --> 00:11:02.630
if you could only maintain it over time with coercion,

146
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:08.860
whereas if you value freedom of the individual liberty,

147
00:11:08.871 --> 00:11:13.100
remember Nozick is another one of our enlightenment theorists.

148
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.870
So let individual freedom individual rights is the highest good,

149
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:23.710
then you have to accept whatever voluntary transactions generate.

150
00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:27.663
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

151
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.660
<v 0>Starting from a system,
uh,
which you,</v>

152
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:35.770
you have conceded is just so in a,
in a way he,

153
00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:40.510
he turns the table on the left critic of markets by calling their bluff.

154
00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:45.070
Right.
And it's a brilliant argument.
Now you could say,
wow,

155
00:11:45.071 --> 00:11:48.940
this is a philosophy as example after all,
uh,

156
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:52.690
we never start from a system that is

157
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:57.440
why is universally accepted tippy just,

158
00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.860
but I think he would make two points in response to that.

159
00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.070
One is I'm showing you that even if you did,

160
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.330
you would still have this problem that over time it would get undone by the

161
00:12:08.331 --> 00:12:12.320
voluntary transactions of individuals.
And secondly,

162
00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:17.770
Nozick wrote this in 1974 but I think if he had lived while he did live long

163
00:12:21.231 --> 00:12:26.030
enough,
he died about three years ago.
But if he had been writing this book,
um,

164
00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:30.350
after the 19,
early 1990s,

165
00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:34.730
it have had some very good real world examples of what he was talking about

166
00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.040
following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

167
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:42.410
Because in a lot of East Europe and countries slot such as Czechoslovakia and

168
00:12:42.411 --> 00:12:44.120
East Germany,
you know,

169
00:12:44.121 --> 00:12:47.900
they had these huge state enterprises that they had decided to prioritize.

170
00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.090
And what did they do?

171
00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:54.110
Well they basically privatized them on an egalitarian basis.

172
00:12:54.111 --> 00:12:57.080
They sat seemed fair.
So you know,

173
00:12:57.081 --> 00:13:00.860
there would be these giant factories that had been previously stayed down and

174
00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:02.510
everybody would get that little chit,

175
00:13:02.511 --> 00:13:06.980
everybody would get their share of that factory.

176
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:13.350
It was very widespread in Czechoslovakia and Poland in particular,

177
00:13:13.351 --> 00:13:16.920
but also in some of the other x communist countries.

178
00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.580
And what happened?
Well,
you know,

179
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:24.510
some people they don't know what they were probably rolled cigarettes with them.

180
00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.980
Some people put them onto the bed,
some people throw them away,

181
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:34.110
some people put them in shoe boxes,
some people started buying them up,

182
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.200
going around and buying up,
you know,

183
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:44.460
Pete pieces slip this factory that that'd be given out as a result of the

184
00:13:44.931 --> 00:13:48.530
privatization and water,
you know,
you know,

185
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:51.110
five years later,
10 years later,

186
00:13:51.111 --> 00:13:55.280
some of the people who had figured out this might be a good thing to do.

187
00:13:55.281 --> 00:13:56.400
We're making an ass.

188
00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:00.800
And you know at that people basically they didn't have anything.

189
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:05.750
So it's not a completely fanciful example.
Right.

190
00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.850
And Nozick would say,
there you go,

191
00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:13.510
you know what was decided as a fair distribution of these state assets at the

192
00:14:13.821 --> 00:14:17.180
moment of privatization was accomplished,

193
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:22.070
but then markets were allowed to run and some people took risks and some people

194
00:14:22.071 --> 00:14:22.940
are creative,
you know,

195
00:14:22.941 --> 00:14:27.140
maybe some people spend all of their savings buying these things up so they

196
00:14:27.141 --> 00:14:32.000
internalize some risks that might have turned out not to have any value and they

197
00:14:32.001 --> 00:14:34.940
got the benefit.
And so there you go.

198
00:14:34.941 --> 00:14:39.680
Five years later you have inequality,
liberty upsets,

199
00:14:39.681 --> 00:14:40.514
patterns.

200
00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:46.060
Now are we going to go and take the Megan's from the people who bought up those

201
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:50.420
chits and give it back to the people who wrote them,

202
00:14:50.421 --> 00:14:55.421
smoke them and say as cigarettes or gave them away or lost them in order to

203
00:14:55.491 --> 00:14:56.530
recreate

204
00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:57.933
<v 1>the pattern?</v>

205
00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:01.660
<v 0>Nozick Says No.</v>

206
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.360
Right?

207
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:10.360
And this is what he means by comparing what he calls historical principles or

208
00:15:10.641 --> 00:15:15.641
procedural principles on the one hand with pat and principles or end state

209
00:15:15.921 --> 00:15:20.190
principles on yeah,
the hand an end state principal.

210
00:15:20.191 --> 00:15:24.310
Specify some results.
So I'm an state,

211
00:15:24.311 --> 00:15:25.240
some condition,

212
00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:30.420
some teleological outcome to use the jargon from last time.

213
00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:37.050
Whereas a historical or a procedural principle specifies no pattern at all and

214
00:15:38.621 --> 00:15:43.621
says whatever is generated by market transactions is Jost and this long,

215
00:15:46.751 --> 00:15:50.650
you know,
200 year old critique of them based on the status quo.

216
00:15:50.651 --> 00:15:55.330
We now see from the well Chamberlain example is just smoke.

217
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:05.550
What about that?
So powerful argument.

218
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:14.800
Anyone not like it?

219
00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.060
<v 1>We were all like it.</v>

220
00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.030
<v 0>What's wrong with it?
That's what makes you uncomfortable.</v>

221
00:16:22.031 --> 00:16:23.610
Where can you give her the mic?
Huh?

222
00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:28.520
<v 1>Yeah.
Can you ride next?
Can you just give a yeah.
Okay.</v>

223
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.480
<v 5>Um,
I'd say that,
um,
the thing that's being distributed,</v>

224
00:16:35.481 --> 00:16:36.860
does it necessarily have to be money?

225
00:16:36.861 --> 00:16:40.460
Like if you change the thing being distributed to,
I don't know,

226
00:16:40.461 --> 00:16:44.270
education for example,
that like having equality,

227
00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:49.271
there might be something that would affect outcomes more than kind of starting

228
00:16:49.371 --> 00:16:51.230
from like a concrete equality.

229
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:55.560
<v 0>Okay.
And why should we care about that?
Um,</v>

230
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:58.650
<v 5>well I guess it's,</v>

231
00:16:58.651 --> 00:17:03.280
it's kind of a way of changing the process as opposed to,

232
00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.210
<v 0>okay.
So that's,
that's fair enough.</v>

233
00:17:06.211 --> 00:17:08.970
So that's one thing somebody might not like about it.

234
00:17:08.971 --> 00:17:11.430
Anything else anyone doesn't like about it?

235
00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:18.160
<v 6>Um,
well we'll achieve one's kind of like a self made.
Got It.</v>

236
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.280
<v 0>Talk Louder.</v>

237
00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:19.840
<v 6>Um,</v>

238
00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:24.100
we'll try is kind of like a self made person B gets there because his basketball

239
00:17:24.101 --> 00:17:27.610
towns,
but it kind of nor ignores the problem of like people who were born into

240
00:17:27.611 --> 00:17:30.490
incredible wealth are important to incredible opportunity.

241
00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:32.790
<v 0>How does it ignore it?</v>

242
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:38.530
<v 6>Well I feel like they're in this situation with voting where you guys is that he</v>

243
00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.330
deserves what he gets and you shouldn't take it away from him.

244
00:17:41.331 --> 00:17:45.710
But I don't know if you can argue that having someone be having been born into a

245
00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:49.620
family that has a lot of money or being born somewhere where you can barely put

246
00:17:49.621 --> 00:17:54.621
food on the table is necessarily someone's more deserving of having one or the

247
00:17:56.131 --> 00:17:56.590
other.

248
00:17:56.590 --> 00:18:01.510
<v 0>So,
but,
but that's what he thinks she's answering,
right?
Cause he's say,
okay,</v>

249
00:18:01.511 --> 00:18:03.880
so you're worried that you know people,

250
00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.870
some people are born with a lot of resources in,
some are born with nothing.

251
00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:11.950
He's saying fix it just however you want.

252
00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:14.440
So we'll,
you know,

253
00:18:14.441 --> 00:18:18.430
start off by redistributing and we'll start off with pure equality.

254
00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:22.630
If you're a allow markets to run,
it's still going to become an equal.

255
00:18:22.631 --> 00:18:25.930
I would kind,
right.
That's his point.

256
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:28.960
So what don't you like about that?

257
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:35.190
<v 6>Well,
I feel like there's a problem in the way that maybe the May,</v>

258
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:39.320
it's that he leaves at the markets or to like truly free in some way and that

259
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.390
there's like really free transactions.

260
00:18:41.391 --> 00:18:46.391
But I feel like there's not necessarily going to be ever,

261
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:50.510
<v 0>but that's,
isn't that why he uses the,
well Chamberlain and it's only a quarter,</v>

262
00:18:50.511 --> 00:18:53.210
you know,
it's only a quarter for crying out loud,
you know,

263
00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:58.040
and you didn't have to give it,
uh,
you know,
it's,
it's a trivial amount,

264
00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:02.300
but there it is,
you know,
five years later he's the millionaire and you,
you know,

265
00:19:02.301 --> 00:19:04.190
you're still working in a factory.

266
00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:10.820
You're not comfortable with it.
No.
But you're not sure why.

267
00:19:10.821 --> 00:19:13.040
Anybody else want to say what,

268
00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.930
it's a very clever example.
It's,

269
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.560
it's an example of where the philosophers example really cuts to something

270
00:19:24.841 --> 00:19:28.740
important.
Yeah.
What's wrong with it?

271
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:29.301
<v 7>Well,</v>

272
00:19:29.301 --> 00:19:33.830
it seems like will Chamberlain is an exception because the bell Chamberlain's

273
00:19:33.831 --> 00:19:35.000
and exception.
Why?

274
00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:38.780
Because the poor will tend to stay poor and the ritual tend to stay rich.

275
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:42.590
And just because there's occasional disruption of the pattern doesn't mean the

276
00:19:42.591 --> 00:19:44.930
pattern will be fluctuating like all over the place.

277
00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:49.450
<v 0>Okay.
So he's unusual,</v>

278
00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.200
but what about the,
okay,
let's grant your point.

279
00:19:53.201 --> 00:19:57.020
But what about the example I just gave of the Poland,

280
00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.650
the after 1989 you know,

281
00:19:59.651 --> 00:20:04.480
everybody starts out equal and it just had some people see an opportunity here

282
00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.950
and they get rich and other people down and they lose out.

283
00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:13.480
<v 7>Well,
Nozick is relegating like the principals to the very beginning.</v>

284
00:20:13.481 --> 00:20:14.530
He's saying you have to own,

285
00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.830
you can only apply your principles at the beginning and he doesn't let you do

286
00:20:17.831 --> 00:20:19.090
that.
Like it's a continuous thing.

287
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:23.280
<v 0>I don't think he'd back down that quickly.
He'd say,
look,</v>

288
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:26.820
the point of this example is I'm writing you define the beginning.

289
00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:28.501
So you know,

290
00:20:28.501 --> 00:20:33.450
after 1999 the Polish government defines the new beginning.

291
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.320
Everybody gets an equal share of state assets.
We did it,
you know,

292
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:40.260
we're creating private property for the first time.

293
00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.420
Everybody's getting an equal share.

294
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.660
But five years later we have inequality.

295
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.113
Yes ma'am.

296
00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:55.860
<v 3>Do you use in particular the example with the shares of factories in the Soviet</v>

297
00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:55.861
Union?

298
00:20:55.861 --> 00:21:00.300
I think that Nozick is perhaps making the false assumption that everyone is

299
00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:05.301
going to have equal ability to make use of that fair distribution at the

300
00:21:05.851 --> 00:21:10.710
beginning when in fact people who are poor are not going to be able to buy up

301
00:21:10.711 --> 00:21:14.910
the other shares of the factories and it's going to exacerbate any inequality

302
00:21:14.911 --> 00:21:15.960
that was already there.

303
00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:20.050
<v 0>Well,
I notice your point is well taken,</v>

304
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:24.310
but notice I say Czechoslovakia and Poland because in Soviet Union what tended

305
00:21:24.311 --> 00:21:26.220
to happen was,
um,

306
00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:30.080
bureaucrats from the old system use this.

307
00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:35.570
They're a special position in the bureaucracy and the intimate knowledge of what

308
00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:40.360
was going on to,
to enrich themselves and grab a lot of these assets.
So,

309
00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.240
uh,
I didn't want to go with that example,
but in,

310
00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:46.810
in the east European country says there's a lot less of that.

311
00:21:46.811 --> 00:21:51.580
And it was more of a sort of genuine new beginning.
But you still,

312
00:21:51.581 --> 00:21:56.090
you look at a country like Poland,
then it rapidly became massively on equal.

313
00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:57.331
<v 3>Well,
that makes sense.</v>

314
00:21:57.331 --> 00:22:01.200
But I would assume that those small inequalities that existed in Poland at the

315
00:22:01.201 --> 00:22:06.201
beginning of that redistribution ended up creating those massive inequality.

316
00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:10.900
<v 0>That's right.
It's just like one quarter at a time.
Right.
Okay.
But that,</v>

317
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.990
that's knows point.
You don't need,
you know,

318
00:22:13.991 --> 00:22:18.991
some massive injustice to be done at the beginning in order to get eugenic

319
00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:23.440
qualities over time.
Um,
so,

320
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:25.600
you know,
that's his,
let's,

321
00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:29.380
let's modify the wealth Chamberlain example a little bit.

322
00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:33.100
Let's suppose what before I do that,

323
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.360
how many people think that the,
that the outcome and the,
well,

324
00:22:37.361 --> 00:22:38.860
Chamberlain is just fine,

325
00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:47.540
so he gets rich.
But you know,
people want him to get rich,
so,
okay.

326
00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:51.290
How many think it's not fine?
Okay.
A few.

327
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.860
So let's now let's play with it a better and see if your opinion changes.

328
00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.353
What else

329
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:04.790
he takes that?
What if,
let,
let's just imagine it's a,
it's a,

330
00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.880
a single company town.
Okay.
It's a single company town.

331
00:23:08.881 --> 00:23:13.881
All these people who go to these games basically work in the only factory in

332
00:23:14.431 --> 00:23:15.264
town.

333
00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:19.810
And let's just imagine that after five or eight years of this,

334
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:24.470
when he's getting close to retirement and he's not playing such good basketball

335
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:28.560
anymore,
anyway,
wealth says to himself,

336
00:23:28.561 --> 00:23:29.670
you know what I'm gonna do,

337
00:23:29.671 --> 00:23:34.671
I'm gonna buy the only factory in town and he buys the factory in which they

338
00:23:35.401 --> 00:23:36.234
will work.

339
00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:42.760
And so he now owns the factory Brido superior transaction,

340
00:23:42.761 --> 00:23:45.380
voluntary transaction.
He uses these,
Megan's,

341
00:23:45.381 --> 00:23:48.920
he's accumulated from all of their quarters to buy the factory.

342
00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:53.270
But you know,
uh,
Time's a tough,
the,

343
00:23:53.271 --> 00:23:57.430
this globalization Kyle on the factory is losing money and his,

344
00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:02.570
his manager says to him,
you've got to massively cut your wages here.

345
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:06.860
And so he gets into it,
you know,

346
00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:11.060
confrontation with the workers and uh,
uh,

347
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:13.880
they won't back down.
And He,
his company,

348
00:24:13.881 --> 00:24:18.440
he thinks is not making as much money as it should.
And so he says,
well,

349
00:24:18.441 --> 00:24:21.200
unless you take a 70% pay cut,

350
00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:23.450
I'm moving this company to Mexico.

351
00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:29.830
So they are in effect,

352
00:24:29.831 --> 00:24:34.831
forced to take a 70% pay cut as a result of this transaction.

353
00:24:35.441 --> 00:24:38.620
Now what about that?
What would Nozick say?

354
00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:45.020
Well,
it knows it.
Say about that.

355
00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.880
Wouldn't know Zach would be fine with it.
You any,

356
00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:55.613
<v 1>yeah,</v>

357
00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.050
<v 0>that's,
that's the way the cookie crumbles,</v>

358
00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:59.423
<v 1>right?</v>

359
00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:08.070
<v 0>Losses.
Ms Lie where they fall.
It's a famous line from,
uh,</v>

360
00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:13.260
American judge called learn at hand there to,
you know,
that's what happened.

361
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:16.680
They chose to give him all of this money.

362
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:22.140
Maybe they didn't anticipate what he was going to do with it,
but you know,

363
00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:25.050
that was then,
and this is now and uh,

364
00:25:25.051 --> 00:25:27.990
he's entitled to do whatever he wants with his money.

365
00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:31.043
<v 1>Okay.</v>

366
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.590
<v 0>How many people think that changes this?</v>

367
00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:36.953
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

368
00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:40.960
<v 0>If,
if we,
if we doctor nozicks example in this way,</v>

369
00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.680
how many people think so sandy,
buddy think it changes anything.

370
00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:50.500
Somebody who previously thought it was okay,
but now it's less.
Sure.

371
00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:54.790
There's nobody.
Yeah.
Why?
Let's get there,

372
00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.710
<v 1>Mike.
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh yeah,</v>

373
00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.340
yeah,
yeah.
So

374
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.380
<v 8>real explanation.
I just think it's morally wrong,
um,</v>

375
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:14.230
because it's kind of course some of the people,
um,

376
00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:15.610
to go by his money and everything.

377
00:26:15.611 --> 00:26:20.110
So while before you just kind of earning money for his own happiness in his own

378
00:26:20.111 --> 00:26:24.370
like utility,
I guess in this case he's using his money.
Um,

379
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.740
and team has had bad moral implications.

380
00:26:26.741 --> 00:26:29.560
So that's why I'm slightly more uneasy with this outcome.

381
00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.140
<v 0>So it's,
it's why do you say he's doing what?</v>

382
00:26:33.141 --> 00:26:37.170
That he's taking advantage of the situation in some way?

383
00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.160
I guess so.
Yeah.
Now notice,

384
00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:46.600
well,
any anyone want to disagree with that?

385
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:48.893
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

386
00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:54.060
<v 3>well I think it changes the situation in a different way and that now we're</v>

387
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:56.660
having coercion of a group of people to,
uh,

388
00:26:56.770 --> 00:27:00.840
keep the pattern of wilt Chamberlain being in charge,
um,

389
00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:06.160
intact.
So even though it does seem like at first glance,

390
00:27:06.161 --> 00:27:10.050
like a,
you know,
mutually beneficial arrangement,
um,

391
00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:13.540
it seems as though people are being coerced into doing something in order to

392
00:27:13.541 --> 00:27:16.600
maintain a,
but where's the coercion?
Well,

393
00:27:16.601 --> 00:27:19.450
they're being coerced into taking this pay cut,

394
00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.080
even though it seems as though a really bad move for them.

395
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:26.500
So,
I mean,
they have no,
they have no choices.

396
00:27:26.501 --> 00:27:29.170
So I guess they've been backed into this corner,

397
00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.750
<v 0>but while they have the choice of not being employed by well,</v>

398
00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:34.573
<v 1>right.</v>

399
00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.890
<v 0>I guess that's just,
you know,
we have this,
uh,</v>

400
00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:43.150
this essay question,
which some of you are probably working on,
you know,

401
00:27:43.151 --> 00:27:44.560
Joan Robinson's line,

402
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:49.130
the worn thing worse than being exploited as not being exploited.
But,
um,

403
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:52.030
he's saying,
you know,
I,

404
00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:56.140
I'm choosing to close down my factory and moving to Mexico.

405
00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.000
<v 1>Oh,
um,</v>

406
00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:04.040
<v 0>I'm not coercing you.
I just don't want to run a factory.
We had a loss.</v>

407
00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:12.650
Most people wouldn't,

408
00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:17.770
wouldn't allow the market to run indefinitely.

409
00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:21.520
So for instance,
we have laws if you have,

410
00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:27.840
if you have a hurricane and there's no water in as part of the country where

411
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:36.510
that's been hit by the hurricane and the local hardware store with bottled water

412
00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.690
suddenly ramps up the price 1000%,

413
00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:46.600
we call it price gouging.
It's an evil thing.

414
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:52.510
But you know,
he would say,
look,
did demand for water just went way up.

415
00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:54.910
I have water.

416
00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.130
Why should it be price gouging?

417
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:04.070
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

418
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:06.290
<v 0>So that's the point of the,</v>

419
00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:11.010
of the outsourcing example,
right?
The,

420
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:14.720
the,
the point is at,
at some point,

421
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:19.130
most people are going to say,
no,
we can't just allow the market,

422
00:29:19.131 --> 00:29:19.980
we have to pay,

423
00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:25.020
pay attention to the context in which people are buying water right after

424
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:30.140
hurricane through no fault of their own and the price of water has skyrocketed.

425
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:33.410
And so we were going to have laws to punish people.

426
00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.970
<v 1>Paul who,
who um,</v>

427
00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:41.520
<v 0>engage in price gouging.
Anyone</v>

428
00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:48.470
who,
thanks.
So we should have laws against price gouging.
Yeah.
Okay.

429
00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:53.120
Now if we should have laws against price gouging and we have laws against the

430
00:29:53.121 --> 00:29:54.230
sort of thing that,

431
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:59.830
well Chamberlain is in my modification of nozicks example

432
00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:02.570
is proposing to do

433
00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:08.060
anyone think we should have laws against price gouging but we shouldn't have

434
00:30:08.061 --> 00:30:10.310
laws limiting what?

435
00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:14.990
<v 1>No.
Is that right?</v>

436
00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:24.990
<v 0>That what he's threatening to do is like price gouging or,</v>

437
00:30:24.991 --> 00:30:27.300
so anybody think it's not like price gouging?

438
00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:31.560
<v 3>Why?
So what's the difference?
Yeah,
no,</v>

439
00:30:31.561 --> 00:30:35.640
I think I was thinking it's like mill's harm principle a little bit.

440
00:30:35.641 --> 00:30:40.641
So maybe you could actually find before the price gouging and for wilt

441
00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:45.890
Chamberlain a reason to allow a government to say that you're not allowed to do

442
00:30:47.131 --> 00:30:50.790
it,
even though it seems perfectly fine as a market transaction.

443
00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:54.250
<v 0>So it's a w,
but what is the difference?</v>

444
00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:59.120
<v 3>I'm saying they're similar because they both involve harming people.</v>

445
00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.270
<v 0>They both involve harming people.</v>

446
00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:06.670
But the price gouging is worse somehow than what wealth is proposing to do.

447
00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.090
<v 3>Well,
I am not saying that it's necessarily worse.
I could be,</v>

448
00:31:12.091 --> 00:31:14.730
but I don't have a definite reason to say so.

449
00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:15.923
<v 1>Okay.</v>

450
00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:20.920
<v 0>So I think nozicks point is going to be,
well,
you know,</v>

451
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:22.900
anytime you're going to step in,

452
00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:27.380
anytime the government is going to step in and say this cross some line,

453
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:32.480
uh,
for,
even though it's voluntary transactions,

454
00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:37.810
they're not voluntary in any meaningful sense because people are in such

455
00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.110
extremists.

456
00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:40.240
<v 1>Okay.</v>

457
00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.270
<v 0>Um,
the,
the,
um,</v>

458
00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:44.500
<v 1>okay.</v>

459
00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:49.120
<v 0>Price gouging situation is,
um,
an example,</v>

460
00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.960
but you're still gonna have to say,
well,
how do we know where to draw that line?

461
00:31:52.961 --> 00:31:57.750
When,
when is it,
um,
when is it going to be the case that

462
00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:06.160
the position we are putting people in and saying choose is so bad that uh,

463
00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:13.580
the government steps in,
is it when they're about to die?
Uh,
or is it,

464
00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:16.770
you know,
not quite that far,
but how,
where,

465
00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:21.470
where are we going to decide what is the point at which we step in and start

466
00:32:21.471 --> 00:32:25.580
making interpersonal judgments of utility?
That's why we really saying,
right.

467
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:29.750
We were saying,
um,
at some point we're going to step in,

468
00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:33.230
the state's going to step in,
but um,

469
00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:36.980
we don't have a very good account of at what point this,

470
00:32:36.981 --> 00:32:40.220
if you say at no point is the going to step in,

471
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:44.510
then you're really back to saying,
you know,
in the,

472
00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:50.170
in the example we talked about way back with the Edgeworth box that the bag lady

473
00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:54.630
should die because she has nothing that Trump wants.
And so that's supper,
righto,

474
00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:59.150
efficient result.
But if you,
if you want to say,
well,

475
00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.720
at some point before that point,
the state should step in.

476
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:04.880
You need some account of what it is.

477
00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:08.130
<v 2>And,
um,</v>

478
00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:13.740
<v 0>given that things happen and circumstances change,</v>

479
00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:19.480
just saying if the initial conditions with Justin,

480
00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.720
the transactions were voluntary,

481
00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:26.960
the outcome must be just isn't going to be satisfying in every instance because

482
00:33:27.871 --> 00:33:32.871
the status quo changes changes that can be drift if you like utility drift in

483
00:33:34.171 --> 00:33:39.171
the status quo that you might and different people will,

484
00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:44.460
well thank the state should get involved at different points.

485
00:33:44.461 --> 00:33:48.030
But there are very few people I think who are going to go all the way and say,

486
00:33:48.031 --> 00:33:51.150
well the bag lady should just die.

487
00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.050
Or all these people should lose their jobs.

488
00:33:55.320 --> 00:34:00.210
Maybe that'll be a more difficult case for some of you then for others.

489
00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:01.343
But

490
00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:07.340
it doesn't seem very credible to say you're not gonna have any point at which we

491
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:10.500
are going to say the state should step in.

492
00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:15.690
But now Nozick was one is say,
well even if I can see that,
that

493
00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:20.040
we really want to keep it to a minimum

494
00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:26.280
because the problem is we don't agree.

495
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.520
The problem about having any,

496
00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:34.640
any patent or end state conception of what's allowable in society is we don't

497
00:34:34.681 --> 00:34:39.120
agree.
We have deep pluralism of values in this society.

498
00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:43.680
What some people think is right,
other people don't think it's right.

499
00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:49.460
And why should the people who are in the majority get to impose their view on

500
00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:55.500
everybody else?
Or indeed,

501
00:34:55.530 --> 00:35:00.480
why should people are in a minority get to impose their view on anybody else?

502
00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:04.680
Why should anybody get to impose their view on anybody else?

503
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:06.930
That's his plan.

504
00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:12.920
And we saw in the last lecture that he made a distinction between redistribution

505
00:35:13.831 --> 00:35:15.000
and compensation.

506
00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:20.480
Remember he said that we would only get the minimal state as a result of

507
00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:25.890
forcible inclusion of independence,

508
00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:30.510
but if they could in principle be compensated,
making it legitimate,

509
00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:33.930
we wouldn't get anything more because people don't agree.

510
00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:36.780
So some people would say it's terrible for people to lose.

511
00:35:36.781 --> 00:35:38.850
Their others would say,
oh,

512
00:35:38.851 --> 00:35:41.730
well I should have thought about that when they were putting all those corridors

513
00:35:41.731 --> 00:35:45.930
in the box that they giving him power.
So

514
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:51.250
if you cast your mind back to last week's,
uh,

515
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:55.590
last week's lecture on Wednesday,
we ended up saying,

516
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:56.510
well,

517
00:35:56.510 --> 00:36:01.510
no zincs argument isn't as powerful as it looks because we could do more in the

518
00:36:01.891 --> 00:36:05.760
name of compensation that he wants to do,
right?
We could,

519
00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:08.640
we could allow,
um,

520
00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:13.680
the creation of an employment insurance.
Um,
remember this,

521
00:36:13.681 --> 00:36:16.080
the fear of odd being unemployed and all of that.

522
00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:21.390
So he might agree about that,
but say,
you know,

523
00:36:21.391 --> 00:36:22.800
it's still better.

524
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:29.340
It's still better to think in a compensatory idiom for one thing.
Yes,

525
00:36:29.341 --> 00:36:31.860
you might get unemployment insurance that way,

526
00:36:31.861 --> 00:36:34.620
but thank you for all the things a welfare state does.

527
00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:39.770
It gives protection to the disabled.
It gives,
um,

528
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:46.180
you know,
civil rights guarantees.
These are all sorts of things that,
um,

529
00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:48.800
what did it come about?
Um,

530
00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:53.180
because not enough people would want them.
I know,
you know,

531
00:36:53.181 --> 00:36:54.800
the disabled are minority.

532
00:36:54.801 --> 00:36:58.580
The African Americans before the Civil Rights Act were a minority,

533
00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:03.820
so they wouldn't be able to force everybody takes sect what they wanted.

534
00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:07.020
So it wouldn't get done as,

535
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:10.770
as a result of the kind of mechanism that creates the minimal state.

536
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:15.000
There'd be a lot of things government currently does that wouldn't happen

537
00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:21.930
and it's better to have compensation rather than redistribution because

538
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.920
compensation doesn't require us to agree about

539
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:28.021
a pattern.

540
00:37:28.021 --> 00:37:33.021
It doesn't require us to agree on what kind of outcome is actually just the

541
00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:36.630
whole idea of compensation is

542
00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.630
making somebody whole,
you know,

543
00:37:40.631 --> 00:37:44.260
if one of you walks up to the street and punches me in the face,

544
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:45.703
<v 1>okay,</v>

545
00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:50.910
<v 0>and I go to court and sue you.
The question is how,
what damage,</v>

546
00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:56.180
what damage did that angry student duty and Shapiro and how much should Shapiro

547
00:37:56.881 --> 00:37:58.740
be compensated to port?

548
00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:02.610
I'm on at least as high an indifference curve as he was before that.

549
00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:07.690
Right?
That's the only question we don't have to ask.
The question,

550
00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:11.620
should he have been where he was before?

551
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:17.790
Is the distribution of wealth in society that existed before Shapiro was punched

552
00:38:19.301 --> 00:38:23.080
by the angry student?
Was that Josh,
we don't have to ask that question.

553
00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:26.020
If we're going to do compensation,
we just say,

554
00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:28.870
how do we make Shapiro Hall?
How does,

555
00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:31.780
how does the person who harmed them make him whole,

556
00:38:31.781 --> 00:38:34.750
how much money does he have to give him to make him whole?

557
00:38:34.751 --> 00:38:39.751
That's only question we have to answer and Nozick wants to say

558
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.233
that it's,

559
00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:48.520
it's a much easier thing to deal with precisely because in a society where

560
00:38:48.521 --> 00:38:52.900
there's deep pluralism of values where we don't agree on watch,

561
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:54.910
just um,

562
00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:00.780
it's a much more limited in inquiry into how do we compensate some particular

563
00:39:01.631 --> 00:39:03.880
individual to undo

564
00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:09.390
the particular harm that was done to them and make them whole.

565
00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:13.620
We don't have to agree on what the just distribution of wealth and income in

566
00:39:13.621 --> 00:39:16.220
this society is in order to answer that

567
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.850
<v 2>question.
Right.</v>

568
00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.590
<v 0>Is that a good argument?</v>

569
00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:26.460
That compensation is much less demanding metaphysically then redistribution

570
00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:35.040
because compensation doesn't require us to agree on what is just,

571
00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:40.730
it just requires us to figure out what,

572
00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:43.241
you know,
what,

573
00:39:43.241 --> 00:39:48.070
how much is owed to Shapiro to make him whole after this harm has,

574
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:51.350
<v 2>yeah.
Is that right?
Is it a good argument?</v>

575
00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:56.560
<v 7>Just because it's easy doesn't mean it's the right argument.
Just cause it's easy</v>

576
00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.350
<v 0>doesn't mean it's the right argument.</v>

577
00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:02.960
<v 7>But is it easy?
Will you said it was just metaphysically,
well,
let,</v>

578
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:05.960
let's suppose we,
we could,
it's easy.

579
00:40:05.961 --> 00:40:08.000
In one sense it's easy in a sense.

580
00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:12.470
<v 0>I mean it might be hard because I'm an say pain and suffering and you know,</v>

581
00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:17.320
I was humiliated and I got to get extra money for that,
you know,

582
00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:22.420
and you know,
my,
my uh,
my girlfriend one look at me cause I got a black guy,

583
00:40:22.421 --> 00:40:26.710
I should get extra money for that.
You know,
we argue about this in court.

584
00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:28.900
So it might be hard in that sense,

585
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:34.200
but it's easier in the sense that we don't need to agree on,

586
00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:36.480
you know,
what,

587
00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:41.200
what my salary should be versus a banker salary versus,
you know,

588
00:40:41.201 --> 00:40:45.520
we don't have to answer questions like that.
We just want to know the number.

589
00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:50.980
We have to arrive at the number to undo the harm to make me whole.
Is that,

590
00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:52.270
is that a bad argument?

591
00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:54.323
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

592
00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:58.490
<v 7>well it completely forgets like the enlightenment idea that there might be a</v>

593
00:40:58.491 --> 00:40:59.660
right answer to anything.

594
00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:05.300
And just by saying that it just dealing in compensation and not like actually,

595
00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:06.143
um,

596
00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:06.950
<v 2>okay.</v>

597
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:08.960
<v 7>Redistribution and figuring out,</v>

598
00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:12.540
<v 0>yeah,
that's a good point.
And I,
but I think now it's like what?
Say I'm not,</v>

599
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:16.590
I'm not saying there should,
there's isn't a right answer.

600
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:19.680
I'm saying we don't agree on what the right answer is,

601
00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:24.840
but I knows it comes saying one writing answers not to coerce people.

602
00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:29.160
So given,
given that we have different values,

603
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:31.290
the answer is liberty.

604
00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:36.920
Let everybody have their own value and not impose one person's value on others.

605
00:41:37.281 --> 00:41:39.320
So I don't think he'd back down that quickly.

606
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:43.160
Say any other reason anyone might think this is

607
00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:44.740
<v 1>okay.</v>

608
00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:48.430
<v 0>I think you're in the right direction,
but you haven't quite nailed it.
Yeah.</v>

609
00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:53.010
<v 3>So I mean,
in terms of money,
maybe it's easier to think about compensation,</v>

610
00:41:53.011 --> 00:41:56.070
but when you're compensating people with goods or services,

611
00:41:56.071 --> 00:41:59.130
you're really having to take those from somewhere else.
They don't,

612
00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.750
they don't disappear out of nowhere.

613
00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:05.520
So on some level you're already redistributing things when you're compensating.

614
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:10.330
So it is really just another form of redistribution.
But in another

615
00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:13.880
<v 0>another word,
I think that's a good argument.</v>

616
00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:17.720
But I think that's another one that I just want to leave you with.

617
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:19.243
I think,

618
00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:24.140
and this this partly reflects with when Nozick was writing,

619
00:42:24.141 --> 00:42:24.470
it was right.

620
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:29.470
He wrote this in 1974 and in 1974 the the,

621
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:34.370
there was a lot more political stability in the world in some ways.

622
00:42:34.371 --> 00:42:39.020
Then there came to be subsequently of course it was unstable in the sense that

623
00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:41.450
we were in the middle of the Cold War,
but,

624
00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:46.710
but the Cold War provided a lot of stability within countries that would

625
00:42:46.971 --> 00:42:51.410
subsequently become very unstable after the end of the Cold War.

626
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:52.820
And so you know,

627
00:42:52.821 --> 00:42:57.821
this idea that while fixing one injustice is how many we can get our minds

628
00:43:01.401 --> 00:43:06.380
around,
particularly if it means making people as well off as they were before.

629
00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:11.210
Where is deciding what's Josh for the society as a whole isn't,
it's much,

630
00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:16.420
much bigger problem and it is potentially much more politically explosive

631
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:19.850
because you know,

632
00:43:19.851 --> 00:43:23.870
we're going to be s and Nozick says liberty upsets patterns.

633
00:43:23.871 --> 00:43:27.350
We're going to be taking wealth from some people and giving it to other people

634
00:43:27.351 --> 00:43:30.150
and that people were taking it from on aren't gonna like it.

635
00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:34.880
Whereas this compensatory ADM is,
is backward looking.

636
00:43:34.881 --> 00:43:39.800
It's focus and it's specific,
but I think when he didn't,

637
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:46.150
what he did and take account off is that the backward looking idiom runs into

638
00:43:49.071 --> 00:43:52.460
the problem of where do we stop,

639
00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:57.050
where do we stop?
After 1991,

640
00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:02.230
there were people in Russia who has said all that property should be given back

641
00:44:02.451 --> 00:44:03.830
to the czar's children.

642
00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:09.680
After the transition in South Africa,

643
00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:15.140
king Goodwill's whaling teeny,
the Zulu King,
he said,

644
00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.260
wow,
all that land that was seized first,

645
00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:22.790
first by the British from my ancestors and then under apartheid was,

646
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:26.600
was seized a,
again for the,
the,
uh,

647
00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:30.320
forced removals and all that,
it should be given to me.

648
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:32.340
I'm the descendant.

649
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.430
And you already have to think about the Middle East

650
00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:45.430
to say that this idea that a backward looking compensatory ADM is less

651
00:44:45.431 --> 00:44:46.960
politically explosive,

652
00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:51.940
then I redistributive ADM as a political matter isn't true because it all

653
00:44:51.941 --> 00:44:55.480
depends how far you go back.
You know,
um,

654
00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:57.480
the Palestinian side,

655
00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:02.500
we'd go back to 1967 or then there's a debate about going back to 1948 and there

656
00:45:02.651 --> 00:45:07.060
are many people who are there say we should go back to the old testament as to

657
00:45:07.061 --> 00:45:07.690
what this,

658
00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:12.690
where we should undo all the injustices that have piled up upon one another over

659
00:45:13.601 --> 00:45:14.434
time.

660
00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:20.350
So this idea that the compensatory idiom is less demanding,

661
00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:25.980
then the redistributive idiom I think is politically naive and ultimately

662
00:45:28.061 --> 00:45:33.061
philosophically not tenable because you're going to have to make a decision

663
00:45:34.001 --> 00:45:36.460
about how far back to go.

664
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.720
<v 1>Okay.</v>

665
00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:43.720
<v 0>Before you decide that you have the benchmark for compensation,</v>

666
00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:48.560
you only have to look at the vaccine history of affirmative action,

667
00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:53.840
which was,
you know,
read Randall Robinson's book that,
that deck,

668
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:58.940
the VEX history of affirmative action to see how difficult a backward looking

669
00:45:58.941 --> 00:46:01.730
compensatory ADM turns out to be.

670
00:46:01.731 --> 00:46:06.260
In practice and joy the midterm,
and we'll see you,
um,

671
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:07.850
three weeks from today.
