1
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.410
So you all recall from our discussion on Monday,
we were,

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.470
we were working our way through nozicks hypothetic call a social contract story.

3
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.970
The thought experiment he asks us to engage in as a way of thinking about the

4
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:22.423
um,

5
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.660
social contract idea as a basis for political legitimacy.

6
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.230
And he asks us in effect to suspend disbelief and work through this story with

7
00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:39.620
him holding out the promise that he's going to show how,
um,

8
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.800
the state can be legitimate.
And so he said,

9
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.610
imagine a hypothetical state of nature,

10
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.070
not consisting of pre political people,

11
00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:55.071
but of people like you and me in a condition where there was no god ferment.

12
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.740
And we would find that to be very inconvenient and inefficient because as locked

13
00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:06.150
said,
every single person would have to be an enforcer of the law of nature.

14
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:09.480
Everybody would have to look after their own property.
Um,

15
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:11.070
it'd be highly inefficient.

16
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.520
That in turn would lead to the creation of kind of block watch associations,

17
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:19.170
mutual protective associations.

18
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.530
They would also though not be particularly efficient because we all know from

19
00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:30.111
reading Adam Smith that the thing that I'm really increases efficiency as

20
00:01:31.051 --> 00:01:32.220
division of labor.

21
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.350
And so some people would go into the protection business in south protection,

22
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.110
um,
full time.
Um,

23
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.320
but because coercive force is a natural monopoly and we know from the discussion

24
00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:52.881
last time Nozick agrees with Glenn back that it's the only natural monopoly.

25
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:54.563
Um,

26
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.530
eventually one of these groups would become dominant.
Um,

27
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.280
and that he calls the,
he,

28
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.270
one of his slogans is that's the ultra minimal state.

29
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.290
Now I did,
I will just pause here.
You might say,

30
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.710
well,
if that was true,

31
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.000
if coercive force is a natural monopoly,

32
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.360
why don't we have a world government?

33
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.680
I mean if we went from,
you know,
malicious to nations,

34
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.320
why aren't nations just malicious in the world

35
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.330
stands to reason,
right?
It's the same.
It just the same thing on a bigger scale.

36
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.400
Anyone wonder what Nozick might say?

37
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.470
Anyone got any idea what Nozick might say in response to that?

38
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.413
<v 1>Okay.</v>

39
00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.080
<v 0>Otherwise,
it doesn't seem very,</v>

40
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.940
that you either either either coerce or force is a natural monopoly or it isn't.

41
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.093
<v 2>No.</v>

42
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.970
<v 0>My missing something here.
What would,
what might Nozick say?</v>

43
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.170
He doesn't confront this.
It's not anywhere in the book,

44
00:03:15.171 --> 00:03:17.600
but it seems like a natural question to ask you now.

45
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.423
<v 2>No.</v>

46
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.090
Anyone want to try this?
Yeah.

47
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.170
<v 3>Uh,</v>

48
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.060
he might argue that because of kind of natural boundaries or even artificial

49
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:34.894
boundaries,

50
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.810
they have been created that the two societies or protection agencies are sort of

51
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.653
separated.

52
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.410
<v 0>Yeah.
Brilliant.
I think you hit the nail on the head.</v>

53
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.680
I think he would say it's conditioned by available technologies of force.

54
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.160
So,

55
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.153
<v 2>mmm.</v>

56
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.230
<v 0>You know,
uh,
if it becomes possible</v>

57
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.250
to project force all over the world,
um,

58
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.430
then we might get to the situation where we will have a world government that

59
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:13.210
indeed countries are just like bigger,
malicious within a country.
Um,

60
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.180
and if there were the available coercive force to create a world government,
uh,

61
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.170
it would be done.
Um,
the famous pacifist philosopher,

62
00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:27.640
Bertrand Russell had a kind of no Ziki and view of this in,
uh,

63
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.550
he had opposed,
uh,
world war two.

64
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.630
He had opposed to creation of Nutria,
uh,
weapons.

65
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:39.631
But as soon as we dropped the bomb on Hiroshima in 1947,

66
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.350
Russell came out and said America should immediately declare a world government.

67
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.270
So he was no Ziki and in his thinking,
um,

68
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.330
but what he lacked was the knowledge of a social scientist.

69
00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:55.270
He brought the clearheaded mess of a philosopher,

70
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.090
but that it wasn't constrained by the,

71
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.310
the knowledge of a social scientist.
Um,
because the mirror,

72
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.180
the mere fact that you have the capacity to destroy the world doesn't mean you

73
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:10.390
have the capacity to enforce obedience on the ground.

74
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.100
This is the lesson we learned in Iraq after 2003,
yes,

75
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:17.380
we could obliterate the Iraqi army,

76
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.730
but that's something quite different from actually being able to enforce the

77
00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:26.530
rule of law within Iraq on the ground.
Right.
And it turns out,

78
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.830
uh,
we'll go into this in more detail a bit later,
but there are,

79
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.300
although there is one respect in which coercive force is a natural monopoly in

80
00:05:37.691 --> 00:05:38.524
that it's

81
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.810
<v 2>mmm hmm.</v>

82
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.040
<v 0>It for it to be a good,
it has to be,</v>

83
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.000
<v 2>um,
uh,</v>

84
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.530
<v 0>it has to be enforced over,
over a given territory.</v>

85
00:05:51.531 --> 00:05:56.531
Otherwise you just have this sorta situations we were talking about on Monday.

86
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.280
Uh,
nonetheless,

87
00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:02.360
there are a various economies of smallness in enforcement.

88
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.703
Um,

89
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.480
and see the community policing literature discovered this in urban contexts.

90
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.150
Um,
so it's not as simple as it looks,

91
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:15.360
but I think just from the point of view of what we need to,
uh,

92
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.620
complete the thought experiment here is that Nozick would indeed say that the

93
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.860
reason we don't have a world government is simply that the available available

94
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:29.270
technologies of coercion have not yet evolved.
And so,
you know,
when it,

95
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.720
when it takes Hannibal's elephants to get over the Alps there they are a natural

96
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:39.410
boundary in a way that they are not when you can lob missiles over the Alps.

97
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.710
And so we shouldn't think of,
um,
we should,

98
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.070
we should always think when he says a natural monopoly over a given territory to

99
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:49.491
some extent,

100
00:06:49.491 --> 00:06:54.491
what counts as a given territory is going to be affected by available technology

101
00:06:54.961 --> 00:06:57.440
as a force.
And we could play this out.
You know,

102
00:06:57.441 --> 00:07:02.360
if you think about the transition from the Italian city states to modern Italy,

103
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.010
there was a version of that.

104
00:07:04.011 --> 00:07:08.900
The changing technology is a force leads to the creation of larger units.

105
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.800
But you know,
as,
as the points I've just made suggest,

106
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.730
this isn't entirely straightforward and uniform,

107
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.540
but it is one basic dynamics.
So that's,

108
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:24.440
I think what he would have said if somebody had raised that question.

109
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.440
Um,
and so you get a single dominant protective association within a given

110
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:31.221
territory,

111
00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:36.221
although we agreeing that the notion of what counts as a territory is somewhat

112
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.590
in flux and conditioned by technology is a force.
That's the,
um,

113
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.150
the dominant protective association is,

114
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:49.070
has cooperated or marginalized all the others.

115
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.730
And then you have a dominant protective association.

116
00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:56.060
Each she calls the ultra minimal state.
Um,

117
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.190
but then there are these people,
these independence.

118
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:05.720
And he gives various colorful examples of them.
But as I said,

119
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:11.060
this was 1974.
Uh,
if we think about it in today's world,

120
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:16.090
you can think about these as people who don't recognize the legitimacy of the

121
00:08:17.691 --> 00:08:22.610
regime.
So they could be people like,
um,

122
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:28.570
the gen tooth flew his plane into a federal building in wherever it was,

123
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.510
um,
Texas,
I think a couple of weeks ago,

124
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.060
I could be,
um,

125
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:39.260
Timothy Mcveigh who blew up the Oklahoma federal bed building,

126
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:44.270
or it could be Osama bin Ladin.
These people are out there and they say,
well,

127
00:08:44.271 --> 00:08:46.880
you might have your dominant protective association,

128
00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:50.630
but we don't care because we don't like it.

129
00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:54.050
We don't recognize it and we are not part of it.
Okay.

130
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.710
And Nozick wants to say,
well,

131
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.630
just because coerce or force is a natural monopoly,

132
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:09.740
these protective associations can't give members protection if they allow the

133
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:14.340
Osama bin Ladin send the Timothy Mcveigh's to run around out there.

134
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:16.800
So what did they gonna do?

135
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.660
They're gonna force them to accept the authority of the state.

136
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.380
They're going to force them to participate.
They're going to say,

137
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:30.740
this is the Dale take it and you can be part of the association or leave it and

138
00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:34.200
you're going to be dealt with accordingly.
We're going to lock you up.

139
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.500
We're going to kill you.
We're going to do something to you.
Right.

140
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.920
That's what's going to happen because of the night that,

141
00:09:40.921 --> 00:09:45.921
because it's the case that these associations cannot protect their members it if

142
00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:50.280
they don't do anything else.
I'm going to come back to that in a minute.

143
00:09:50.281 --> 00:09:54.450
So it's just at this level,
it's just a claim about what would happen,

144
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.480
coercive force being what it is,

145
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.620
and then you have what he calls the minimal state,

146
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.220
Aka the classical nightwatchman state of liberal theory.

147
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.860
The thing that Glenn back has in mind when he says,

148
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:16.160
the government should protect us from the bad guys and nothing else.

149
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.700
The government should protect us from the bad guys and nothing else.

150
00:10:20.701 --> 00:10:25.020
The night watchman state doesn't do anything else in particular.

151
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:29.370
It does not redistribute wealth.

152
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.520
There's not redistribute income and wealth.

153
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:37.020
It does not go into those parades.
Undecidable zones.

154
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.480
Think back to the parade oh diagram.

155
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:44.990
And the reason it doesn't go back to those Paredo undecidable zones is that we

156
00:10:45.631 --> 00:10:50.631
have a very strobus doctrine of individual rights right now.

157
00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:57.050
You might say,
well,
why should we buy that?

158
00:10:57.051 --> 00:10:59.720
And I think what Nozick would say is

159
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.780
he would come back with the doctrine of deep pluralism.
Our values,

160
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:11.300
there's deep pluralism of values.
We don't agree.
You know,

161
00:11:11.301 --> 00:11:14.930
some of us think we should have a welfare state.
Some of us think we shut him,

162
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.680
some of us think we should have universal healthcare.
Some of us don't.

163
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.990
We don't agree about these things.

164
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.500
And because we don't agree about these things,

165
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.120
this dark kind of be the pressure to produce a redistributive state.

166
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.830
We're gonna,
we're going to look at it.
You know,

167
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.130
one of his slogans is rights as side constraints on our actions.

168
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:45.860
We think of rights as site constraints on what we can do to are the people we

169
00:11:45.861 --> 00:11:47.000
can't,
you know,

170
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:52.030
elbow them as we go on our way to maximize our own utility rights aside

171
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:57.190
constraints then not,
um,
and,

172
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.570
and states they're not goals.
So,

173
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.183
um,

174
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.553
<v 1>hm.</v>

175
00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:09.920
<v 0>I don't want to
give you on unnecessary jargon,</v>

176
00:12:09.921 --> 00:12:14.390
but I guess I'll give it to you anyway.
I should have put it on a slide.
So,
um,

177
00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.591
th the,

178
00:12:15.591 --> 00:12:20.591
the philosophical lingo for the difference between Nozick and Rawls,

179
00:12:20.931 --> 00:12:22.790
as we'll see later on the one hand

180
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:27.290
and utilitarianism,

181
00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:32.320
at least in Benson experience on the other hand is day ontological versus t

182
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:38.960
teleological,
d e o n t.
O logical.

183
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.700
They on tautological versus teleological,

184
00:12:43.701 --> 00:12:47.960
t e l e O.
Logical.
And what,

185
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.540
what he's trying,
what is captured day?

186
00:12:50.541 --> 00:12:55.160
Ontological is a word that comes from the philosopher Emmanuel Kant.

187
00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:00.140
We'll talk more about him in connection with roles I mentioned to you on Monday

188
00:13:00.141 --> 00:13:00.531
the eye.

189
00:13:00.531 --> 00:13:05.390
The basic notion here is affirm principles that you can,

190
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.100
if you,
that you would be happy with no matter how they affected you.

191
00:13:10.101 --> 00:13:14.180
Then not hypothetical imperatives.
They're not,

192
00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:18.890
you know,
I'll support private profit.
If it makes me rich,
they'll,
they're rare.

193
00:13:18.891 --> 00:13:21.080
The,
if,
if I support private property Algebra,

194
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:25.610
support it regardless of whether it makes me rich or poor.
Right?

195
00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:26.893
Uh,

196
00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.790
it's not dependent on any particular empirical conditions.

197
00:13:31.791 --> 00:13:34.010
You would affirm it no matter what.

198
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:39.430
And Can'ts famous example of a categorical imperative is the thing Nozick a PLC

199
00:13:41.651 --> 00:13:44.030
to respect people's autonomy.

200
00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:49.160
Don't treat them simply as means to round bought as ends in themselves.

201
00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:53.900
Okay?
And he's saying,
well,
if we want to respect people's autonomy,

202
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.200
this is just a very strong version of mill's harm principle.

203
00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:59.930
We want to respect people's autonomy.

204
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:05.470
We can't impose conditions on them that they don't agree with.

205
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.830
Okay?
And given that people,

206
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:13.690
given this empirical fact of deep pluralism,
a values,

207
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:18.870
you're not going to get a redistributive state out of my Robert Nozick little

208
00:14:20.111 --> 00:14:23.770
story.
So that's where it's going to stop.

209
00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:31.900
No,
you could say,
okay,

210
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.810
what have we really,
what is really being established here?

211
00:14:37.811 --> 00:14:42.070
Why is Nozick walking us through this zigzag?
You know,
I mean,

212
00:14:42.071 --> 00:14:46.010
it's okay.
It's one way to spend,
uh,
a Monday,

213
00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.800
Wednesday morning between 10 30 and 1130.
But what is the,
what is the point?

214
00:14:50.801 --> 00:14:54.240
What really comes out of this?
You know,
what is,
what is going,

215
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.960
why is he doing this?
Okay?

216
00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.480
And I think that we should,

217
00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:02.960
we need to go back through it a little bit more carefully now and see,

218
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.200
one of the things that he says is he's,

219
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.350
he's telling us both

220
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.550
an explanatory story and a normative story.

221
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.110
What I said here is basically the explanatory story you saying.

222
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:23.470
If you took people like us and you said what would happen if there was in a

223
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.840
state,
they would create a minimal state and they wouldn't create anything more.

224
00:15:27.841 --> 00:15:32.430
That's just an,
it's a,
there's not nothing normative in that yet.

225
00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:38.010
At least not obviously.
So they would create,
um,

226
00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.173
you know,

227
00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:43.650
Glenn backs Utopia and that's all that they would do.

228
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.940
We could argue about whether or not he's right about that.

229
00:15:52.941 --> 00:15:56.330
And I'll come back to that in,
in,
in a minute,
but,

230
00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:00.710
but that's not really nozicks whole agenda.
His real agenda is normative.

231
00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:06.580
What he wants to say is they would do this and this is the only legitimate

232
00:16:07.581 --> 00:16:08.414
state.

233
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.600
That's what he really,
when he wants to convince you that this,

234
00:16:15.601 --> 00:16:20.280
this kind of a state than the classical nightwatchman state of liberal theory,

235
00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.840
liberal in the 19th century were sense of the term,
right?
Libertarian,

236
00:16:24.841 --> 00:16:25.830
we might think of it,

237
00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:31.230
I think today is the only legitimate stake.
Now,

238
00:16:31.231 --> 00:16:35.280
if you said,
well,
why,
why,
what makes it legitimate?

239
00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:45.620
The answer is that long and rather difficult to decipher a chapter on

240
00:16:46.441 --> 00:16:51.000
compensation.
And let me,

241
00:16:51.001 --> 00:16:51.630
I'll just,

242
00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:55.500
I'll give you the bumper sticker version first and then I'll go back and walk

243
00:16:55.501 --> 00:16:59.220
through it.
And you might think it's tendentious,

244
00:16:59.221 --> 00:17:00.840
but um,

245
00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:03.653
<v 1>okay.</v>

246
00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:08.000
<v 0>You know,
philosophers,
examples often give philosophy a bad name.</v>

247
00:17:08.001 --> 00:17:11.900
They create highly artificial examples,
um,

248
00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:16.140
that abstract massively from the real world.
And people,
um,

249
00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:21.920
generally are not impressed when,
uh,
they try to connect it to real problems.

250
00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:23.540
I,
I'm,
you know,

251
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:27.740
my priors to be suspicious of philosophy as examples,

252
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.750
but Nozick is an exception.

253
00:17:29.751 --> 00:17:34.130
He really was a brilliant guy and he doesn't do these things gratuitously.

254
00:17:34.131 --> 00:17:36.500
There's some interesting,
uh,

255
00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.230
and consequential points that come out of this.

256
00:17:39.231 --> 00:17:42.020
So here's what he wants to say.

257
00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.073
<v 1>Okay.</v>

258
00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:51.690
<v 0>This is the,
the,
the shawl set of moves.
This one and this one.</v>

259
00:17:51.691 --> 00:17:55.020
How,
how,
how is it crucial?
What he wants to say is this,

260
00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:00.780
we know that this is going to happen.
What could make it legitimate?

261
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:06.090
We know it's going to happen because coerce or force is a natural monopoly.

262
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:11.640
In fact,
being hardheaded realists about power,

263
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:17.300
no minimals or ultra minimal state is going to permit the bin Laden's and then

264
00:18:18.751 --> 00:18:20.970
make veys to run around threatening them.

265
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:24.000
So they got to force them to join.

266
00:18:24.001 --> 00:18:26.790
What could make it legitimate for them to do that?

267
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.460
Since these independents haven't agreed to join,
right?

268
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.830
And Nozick does one is say agreement.

269
00:18:34.831 --> 00:18:39.810
Consent is the basis of all legitimacy.
Seems like a contradiction.

270
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.420
So he says,
what if

271
00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:51.260
we'd say we,
we put it in the following terms.
What if we say

272
00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:56.810
to the independent out there,
you know what,

273
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:03.530
you don't recognize the legitimacy about operation,

274
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:08.180
but it's too bad because there's a lot more of us than there are of you and

275
00:19:08.181 --> 00:19:11.780
we're going to force you to,
we're going to force you to participate.

276
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.750
But here's the thing,
we,

277
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.410
we understand that violates your rights.

278
00:19:18.411 --> 00:19:21.860
You as an independent or having your rights violated.

279
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:30.630
But we as members are having our rights violated by our fear that you

280
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:41.250
may blow us up.
Maybe one,

281
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:43.490
maybe you're just a philosophical Attica said,

282
00:19:43.491 --> 00:19:48.491
one is around the fields talking to horses and wants to be left alone.

283
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:53.000
But we now know that for sure.
You know,

284
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.190
we don't really know that.
And you know,

285
00:19:55.191 --> 00:19:58.460
there are some people who want to blow us up out there.
We know that.

286
00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:03.260
So everybody in our society,

287
00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.830
in our ultra minimal state is,

288
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:12.490
is experiencing a decline of utility because you're out there and you might blow

289
00:20:13.551 --> 00:20:17.240
us up.
We are experiencing fear.

290
00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.810
Now we understand that you,

291
00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:29.610
if you're forced to join,
are going to lose.

292
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:33.030
You're going to experience a rights violation.
That's true.

293
00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:37.050
But what if we could compensate you for it?

294
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:42.440
We're going to force you to join.

295
00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:47.441
What if we could compensate you for it and still be better off then we were

296
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:54.160
not having compensated you and experiencing the fear.

297
00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.420
So everybody gets,

298
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:04.130
it's somewhat muddled discussion in the chapter when people start reading,

299
00:21:04.131 --> 00:21:05.840
he already says about compensation.

300
00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.170
They think he's talking about um,

301
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:13.820
the members being compensated rather than the independence.

302
00:21:13.821 --> 00:21:18.821
But the idea is the members could compensate the independence and still be

303
00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:20.683
better off.

304
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.250
Now it doesn't mean the members actually compensate the independence,

305
00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.780
then there would be an obvious moral hazard problem,
right?
If,

306
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:37.080
if my choice was to be a member and pay taxes or to be an independent and get

307
00:21:37.571 --> 00:21:41.440
compensated for being forced to join and nobody's going to be a member,

308
00:21:41.441 --> 00:21:43.770
we might as well be independence and get caught.

309
00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:48.070
So he's not talking about actual compensation.
Okay.

310
00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.840
Rather he's saying

311
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.840
if in principle,
so I'm going to violate your rights.

312
00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:00.900
If in principle I could pay you enough to make you whole and still be better off

313
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:05.980
than before I violated your rights,
then everything's Hunky Dory.

314
00:22:05.981 --> 00:22:09.520
We're both better off in a parade.
Oh cents.
Okay.

315
00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:15.610
So what he does in that chapter,
as he works his way through various ways,

316
00:22:15.611 --> 00:22:17.530
this might happen and they all all

317
00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:25.070
fail,
they'll run into problems.
How would you figure the price,
et Cetera,

318
00:22:25.071 --> 00:22:29.960
et cetera.
Right?
And then he says,
well,
it doesn't really matter.

319
00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:36.410
It doesn't really matter that I haven't given an a watertight account of

320
00:22:36.411 --> 00:22:40.730
compensation,
but just let's assume that some such account could be given,

321
00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:44.870
then we'd have solved the problem.
And he,

322
00:22:44.871 --> 00:22:49.871
and he's alluding here to about 40 years of welfare economics that,

323
00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:54.553
um,

324
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:59.510
revolve around this idea of Co hypothetical compensation tests.

325
00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:04.140
Those of you who are interested,
the famous people were caldor Hicks,

326
00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:08.410
Guitar Ski Samuelsson and many others.
Um,

327
00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:13.780
all we're trying to figure out a compensation test that was compatible with the

328
00:23:14.331 --> 00:23:16.550
parade.
Oh system as you know it.

329
00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:22.090
So why of thinking about it is we go back to a parade oh diagram.

330
00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:27.890
And what we were doing when we are talking about neoclassical utilitarianism,

331
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:30.490
remember we said,
um,

332
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:36.500
let's suppose x is the status quo.
We know this is Pareto superior.

333
00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.840
We know this is parade.
Oh,
inferior.

334
00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:42.530
And we can't say anything about the parade are undecidable.
Right.

335
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:47.940
So the question is,
yeah,
is why better than x for society?

336
00:23:47.941 --> 00:23:52.890
There's no answer to that question and nozicks endorsing that,
right?
He's saying,

337
00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:56.580
you know,
be will think why it's better.
A,

338
00:23:56.581 --> 00:23:58.830
we'll think x is better.

339
00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:04.530
Who are we to adjudicate between them?
There's no way to do it.
But the,

340
00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:08.550
the people who are worrying about compensation with thinking about a different

341
00:24:08.551 --> 00:24:12.630
question,
they were saying,
well,
okay,

342
00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.350
we can't say we know.
We can't say that.

343
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:19.980
Why is better than x for society?

344
00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:24.690
But couldn't we say thatZ is better than x?

345
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:29.470
Because althoughZ is,
oh,

346
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.000
those z is Paredo undecidable

347
00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:39.460
it's on the possibility frontier remmber the possibility frontier was the,

348
00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:48.370
the locus of points where it's not possible to improve.
Right.

349
00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:53.880
So the compensation period theorists were actually interested in these two

350
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:59.320
parts of the parade.
Oh,
diagram.
There were saying,
isn't there?

351
00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:04.180
Can't we come up with some way to say thatZ is,

352
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:06.790
is a social improvement on x,

353
00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:13.050
even though it's per undecidable because it's on the possibility frontier.

354
00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:18.930
Isn't there some way to say if you move from off the possibility frontier to on

355
00:25:19.061 --> 00:25:23.200
the possibility frontier,
you can say it's a social improvement.

356
00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.680
So in the Lingo of welfare economics,

357
00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.130
that was the project from caldor and Hicks,

358
00:25:30.131 --> 00:25:32.620
Kotowski Samuelson and all of the others.

359
00:25:32.621 --> 00:25:37.621
They were looking for a way to do that that did not involve into personal

360
00:25:37.931 --> 00:25:39.370
comparisons of utility.

361
00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:44.950
Really important that it not involve interpersonal comparisons of utility.

362
00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:50.223
<v 1>Okay.</v>

363
00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:55.770
<v 0>Because if you make into personal comparisons of utility,
you've,</v>

364
00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:00.480
you're violating consent,
right?
If you,
if you say,

365
00:26:00.481 --> 00:26:03.600
wow,
Z is better than x,

366
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:09.320
but beat us and agree,
I mean a doesn't agree,

367
00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:14.660
you're violating A's.
Right?
So is there some way to do that?
You know,

368
00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:18.870
and we see this all the time in eminent domain cases,
you know,

369
00:26:18.871 --> 00:26:23.660
when the city buys a property forcibly against somebody as well,

370
00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:28.110
uh,
to build a road,
this,
this,
you know,

371
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:32.060
endless toing and froing about what is the value of the house.

372
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:37.490
Um,
and,
and the question is,

373
00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:42.640
can you figure that out without doing interpersonal comparisons of you tell him.

374
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:44.783
And

375
00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:52.560
the problem with what Nozick is doing is that the answer is no.

376
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
The answer is every compensation test that's ever been devised involves coming

377
00:27:01.861 --> 00:27:03.660
up with a common metric,

378
00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:07.200
namely money in terms of which you do the compensation.

379
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:09.150
And because of that,

380
00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:13.680
you're implicitly making interpersonal comparisons of utility.

381
00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.010
So the,
the project of

382
00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:23.650
finding a compensation test that didn't violate the interpersonal comparisons

383
00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.930
criterion failed.

384
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:32.300
And you can't actually do what Nozick wanted us to do.

385
00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.480
Now you could say,
okay,

386
00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:40.960
so here's again an example of the kind of whole architect tonic theory doesn't

387
00:27:42.231 --> 00:27:47.000
work,
but there still might be important insights that survive.

388
00:27:47.001 --> 00:27:47.834
It's

389
00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:49.660
<v 2>fail.
Yeah.</v>

390
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.110
<v 0>So you could say,
for instance,
okay,
once we,</v>

391
00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:56.650
<v 2>okay,</v>

392
00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:58.180
<v 0>once we're aware of that,</v>

393
00:27:58.740 --> 00:27:59.573
<v 2>mmm.</v>

394
00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.610
<v 0>We,
we can say that there,
that even in the creation of a minimal state,</v>

395
00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:10.510
there are some interpersonal comparisons of utility,

396
00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:15.840
namely those involved in judging whether or not it's legitimate to incorporate

397
00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:20.620
the independence

398
00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:31.550
and Nozick might make the following defense of what he's done.
He's,
he might say,

399
00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:32.413
wow,

400
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.333
<v 2>okay.</v>

401
00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:37.000
<v 0>You know,
it was a nice try,</v>

402
00:28:37.001 --> 00:28:39.940
but still what's left of my argument is the following.

403
00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.553
<v 2>MMM.</v>

404
00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:54.180
<v 0>And now the Kantian dictum is ord and tails.
Can</v>

405
00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:01.100
anyone want to tell us about that mean or what and what does it mean to say what

406
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:02.100
entail scamp

407
00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:06.413
<v 2>anyone know</v>

408
00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.920
<v 0>and we say what entails,
can anyone,
anyone want to guess?</v>

409
00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:23.923
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

410
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.920
<v 4>The normative statements that we may make me create bright lines by which we can</v>

411
00:29:31.921 --> 00:29:36.150
determine whether an action is or is not acceptable.

412
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.780
And that's like by saying that we should or should not do something.

413
00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:41.710
We create this bright line where

414
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:46.690
<v 0>on one side we should and side we uh,
yeah,</v>

415
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:47.860
you're in the right direction.

416
00:29:47.861 --> 00:29:51.040
You're making it more complicated than it needs to be.
I mean,

417
00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:54.760
the basic idea is we can't have a moral obligation to do something that's

418
00:29:54.761 --> 00:29:55.594
impossible.

419
00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.280
We can't have a moral obligation to do something that's impossible.

420
00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:07.230
That's the,
that's the way in which ord entails.
Can,
is usually interpreted.

421
00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:12.440
Now some people say we should an interpret that way we should interpret comment

422
00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:18.510
to mean when he says what entails can that if we ought to do something,

423
00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:19.890
we should find a way.

424
00:30:19.891 --> 00:30:24.300
I once had a graduate student wrote a dissertation in which he said or entails,

425
00:30:24.301 --> 00:30:28.560
can means that ord entails,
must try as hard as possible.

426
00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:33.870
Well,
you know that,
that that's that's uh,
that's one way you could go with this,

427
00:30:33.871 --> 00:30:35.670
but it's not what I have in mind here.

428
00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.070
What I have in mind here that that knows it.

429
00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:43.130
I think would say when confronted with the failure of the compensation tests to

430
00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:47.190
work without interpersonal comparisons,

431
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.440
I think Nozick would say,
well

432
00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.500
or didn't entails,
can in the conventional sense,

433
00:30:54.501 --> 00:30:59.501
we can't expect people to do something that's impossible and for that reason.

434
00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:02.700
<v 2>Okay.</v>

435
00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.910
<v 0>What drives this really is the natural monopoly of force argument.</v>

436
00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:09.000
Another way you could see this,
you could say,
well,
so

437
00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:10.230
<v 2>yeah,</v>

438
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:14.790
<v 0>the problem with the compensation argument compensating the independence is we</v>

439
00:31:14.791 --> 00:31:16.440
could equally say if the company,

440
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:21.500
if the independence could compensate the members for their fear and still be

441
00:31:22.081 --> 00:31:24.420
better off,
that would be just as good.

442
00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:26.140
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

443
00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:30.430
<v 0>Right.
Nozick saying the members experience the fear,</v>

444
00:31:30.431 --> 00:31:34.090
they forced the con the,
the independence to join.

445
00:31:34.091 --> 00:31:37.240
And if they could compensate them and still be as well off,

446
00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:41.560
then it's legitimate.
But you could do the exact opposite.

447
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:43.660
You could say if the,

448
00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.890
if the independence could compensate everybody,

449
00:31:47.891 --> 00:31:52.891
pay everybody aside an amount so that they stop experiencing fear,

450
00:31:55.910 --> 00:32:00.320
um,
and still be better off,
you know,
in,
in effect,

451
00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.930
Osama bin Laden did this when they made it,

452
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:07.760
when he alcaide he made a deal in the 1980s,

453
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:12.080
uh,
they promised the Saudis they wouldn't,
they would,

454
00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.150
they promised the Saudis that they wouldn't,

455
00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:15.383
<v 2>mmm,</v>

456
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:22.100
<v 0>do I need terrorism in Saudi Arabia?
And then the Saudis left them.</v>

457
00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:26.040
The Saudi government left them alone.
I mean,
that,
that eventually unravel.

458
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:30.480
But so essentially you could say that was a version of compensating the Saudi

459
00:32:30.481 --> 00:32:34.500
population for the fear and still being better off.

460
00:32:34.501 --> 00:32:39.340
So Nozick would have to be indifferent between those two things,
right.

461
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:42.260
If,
if it's all that striving at is the compensation.

462
00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:44.930
I think what he would say is while in principle,
yes,

463
00:32:44.931 --> 00:32:48.290
but in practice because of the natural monopoly of force,

464
00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:50.293
um,

465
00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:55.730
it's the independence who are going to lose the independence,

466
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:57.920
we're going to lose.
There's fewer of them.

467
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.433
<v 1>Right.</v>

468
00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:01.291
<v 0>And in the end,</v>

469
00:33:01.291 --> 00:33:06.291
the event just pursuing this example in the event since both the Saudis and

470
00:33:07.261 --> 00:33:10.440
everybody else knew that Alcaide,

471
00:33:10.441 --> 00:33:14.370
his ultimate objective is regime change in Saudi Arabia.

472
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:19.700
I wasn't a very credible promise and indeed,
uh,
eventually,
uh,

473
00:33:19.701 --> 00:33:24.701
and indeed there were Al Alcaide operations in Saudi Arabia in the late 1990s.

474
00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:31.800
So it wasn't a very credible promise.
And,
uh,
eventually after nine 11,

475
00:33:31.801 --> 00:33:33.530
the Saudis,
um,

476
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:38.600
smelled the coffee and got on board with the operation to try and stomp out al

477
00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:42.450
Qaeda.
Okay.
So yes,
in principle,

478
00:33:42.451 --> 00:33:46.080
if the independence could compensate blahbity Blah and just be as well off,

479
00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:51.210
we would be indifferent in practice because of the natural monopoly of force,

480
00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:53.610
the independence are going to lose.

481
00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:58.050
So ordered tails can,
it's not possible.

482
00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:03.290
It's not possible to imagine a state of affairs in which the independence of

483
00:34:03.321 --> 00:34:07.570
tolerated.
So we'll accept that.
That is legitimate.
It.

484
00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.200
In other words,
the,
the,

485
00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:16.680
the violation of rights is unavoidable.
Uh,

486
00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:21.150
and therefore it's not a legitimate,
um,
that would be the claim.

487
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.823
Now,

488
00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:35.800
Nozick would then say,
so my arguments of vibes,

489
00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:41.220
my argument survives because of we've now supplemented the natural monopoly of

490
00:34:42.341 --> 00:34:45.220
force with ord entails scan.
Um,

491
00:34:45.221 --> 00:34:50.080
there's no way not to have the ultra minimal state become the minimal state.

492
00:34:50.410 --> 00:34:51.243
So I can't,

493
00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:56.340
it's legitimacy can't be criticized for that particular,

494
00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:00.280
for the violation of the rights of the Independent.
In a way,

495
00:35:00.281 --> 00:35:05.281
it's a bit reminiscent of Locke's argument about majority rule that we're going

496
00:35:05.321 --> 00:35:10.000
to talk about when we get to the last part of the course in more detail.

497
00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:14.920
What you know already about lock from what I've told you in the past,

498
00:35:14.921 --> 00:35:17.230
is that Locke says,

499
00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:21.880
when there are disagreements about what natural law in tails,

500
00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.900
there's no earthly authority who's allowed to settle them.
Remember,

501
00:35:25.901 --> 00:35:27.040
we went through this,
right?

502
00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:32.400
So each person in effect has the right to enforce the law of nature and indeed

503
00:35:33.191 --> 00:35:36.490
the responsibility to enforce the law of nature.

504
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.380
God speaks to us all individually when we read the scriptures.

505
00:35:40.381 --> 00:35:43.890
And if you're worried him one way,
and I read him the other way,
there's no pope,

506
00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:48.810
there's no king,
there's no magistrate who can tell us who is right.
Okay.

507
00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:51.720
It's one of the sources of locks.
Egalitarianism.

508
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:59.160
What another thing that Locke says that I haven't talked about yet by we'll get

509
00:35:59.161 --> 00:36:00.570
into in more detail,

510
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:05.810
is so what actually happens in practice when people disagree.

511
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:12.060
He says,
if you think,
if you think

512
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.320
the state is violating natural law,

513
00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:22.380
not only do you have a right,
you actually have an obligation to resist,

514
00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:29.180
but if nobody else agrees with you,
what's going to happen?

515
00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:37.820
You're going to be out of luck,
right?
As lockbox.
You,

516
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:41.480
you,
you should look for your,
he,
he,
no,
he says you'll,

517
00:36:41.481 --> 00:36:46.470
you should look for your reward in heaven,
I.
E you'll be,

518
00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:48.090
you know,
if,
if I,

519
00:36:48.091 --> 00:36:51.630
if you take the view that the government is not legitimate and you're going to

520
00:36:51.631 --> 00:36:54.120
resist it and nobody else agrees with you,

521
00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:57.720
you're going to wind up being tried for treason and executed.

522
00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:02.190
That's what's going to happen.
But this life is short.
Have an x,
y,
and Z.
Turnell.

523
00:37:02.191 --> 00:37:07.050
So why worry,
right?
Uh,
is essentially Locke's view of the matter,

524
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:09.300
right?
Um,

525
00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:16.070
so the no Ziki and independent is in the same position as a lock.

526
00:37:16.671 --> 00:37:18.330
He in person who,

527
00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:23.810
who reads the scripture to say that they must resist the state and,

528
00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:27.600
and very few others agree with them.
They just,
you know,

529
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:31.620
gonna get their reward in the next life,
so be it.
Um,

530
00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:36.060
but if lots of people agree with you,
then you're going to have 60,

531
00:37:36.061 --> 00:37:38.310
98,
then you're going to have a revolution.

532
00:37:38.311 --> 00:37:41.010
You're going to get rid of the monarch,
right?

533
00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:45.450
So you can't know for sure that people don't agree with you,

534
00:37:45.451 --> 00:37:47.010
but that's what's going to happen.

535
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:52.670
And in a way that that is exactly the same point Nozick is making.

536
00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:57.090
He's saying,
you know,

537
00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:00.410
there are a lot more people in the ultimate animal state then there are in the

538
00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:05.090
independent.
So it's gonna go that way.
There it is.

539
00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:06.500
It's a nature of power.

540
00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:11.510
The nature of coerce or force an ort entails can mango,

541
00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:20.753
what about that?

542
00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:25.840
How many people find that convincing?

543
00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:33.850
Nobody.
Nobody's came is how many people find it on campus.

544
00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:37.443
<v 2>How about it?</v>

545
00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:39.370
<v 0>This t two,</v>

546
00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:44.390
two zero convinced to I'm convinced and are 136 on decided like Massachusetts

547
00:38:46.181 --> 00:38:46.900
voters here.

548
00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:47.733
<v 2>Paul,</v>

549
00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.580
<v 0>what's,
what's wrong with it?</v>

550
00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:55.493
<v 2>Anyone want to,</v>

551
00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:13.780
<v 5>well,
it seems that forcing the independence to,
you know,</v>

552
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:19.200
submit to the minimalist state directly contradicts the pluralistic,

553
00:39:19.571 --> 00:39:22.270
um,
Dan theological values that it's espousing.

554
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:25.850
So it like undermines the State Ed.
It's very

555
00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:31.070
<v 0>okay.
And um,
what does it contradict which the value of consent,</v>

556
00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:33.883
excuse me,

557
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:37.940
you say it directly contradicts the intellectual values he's espousing,

558
00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:39.710
which value?
The value of consent.
Yeah,

559
00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:41.420
<v 5>the value of,
um,</v>

560
00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.710
consent and how you said,
uh,

561
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:50.400
it should be minimalist because he believes in pluralism and because um,

562
00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:54.630
you can't like force someone and you don't,
you like the Predo thing,

563
00:39:54.631 --> 00:39:55.464
you don't know.

564
00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:58.830
<v 0>Right.
But,
but his answer is Orin pals can,
you know,</v>

565
00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:01.950
it would be lovely if we could get everybody's consent,

566
00:40:01.951 --> 00:40:05.040
but there's no way to get everybody's consent.

567
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:08.480
<v 5>Well.
Then from that follows that they should be,</v>

568
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:12.650
the government should be able to enact like other kinds of policies where our

569
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:15.380
main tail can and they can force people to do things.

570
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:20.370
<v 0>So what would,
what would be an example?</v>

571
00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.280
They would have to just tolerate these independents out there?

572
00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:26.320
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

573
00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.740
<v 0>All right.
I think there's a,
there's a,
I use,</v>

574
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:32.720
there's a little book I used to teach in this course sometimes by a philosopher

575
00:40:32.721 --> 00:40:37.721
called Robert Paul Wolf called in defense of Antica some and he basically goes

576
00:40:37.761 --> 00:40:38.780
the way you were going.

577
00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:41.850
<v 2>He says,
he says,</v>

578
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:47.190
<v 0>consent is,
is a wellspring of legitimacy.</v>

579
00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:53.660
You can't get unanimous consent for any steak,
so no status,

580
00:40:53.661 --> 00:40:54.494
legitimate

581
00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.400
<v 2>Lacy's consistent.
Right.</v>

582
00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:01.520
You can't yet

583
00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.980
<v 0>legitimacy for any states or no status.</v>

584
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.300
Legitimate while states I on at genomic finished end of story.

585
00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:12.673
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

586
00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:17.050
<v 0>Yes.
I think what Nozick would say,
he would make two points.</v>

587
00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:24.840
He would say Robert Paul Wolff is an airhead because

588
00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:31.730
he's forgetting about the difference between

589
00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.990
the philosophical game.

590
00:41:36.991 --> 00:41:41.520
We're playing the the thought experiment and the real world because in the real

591
00:41:41.521 --> 00:41:44.250
world there are two things that are different.

592
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:48.650
One is the natural monopoly of force argument we've already talked about and uh,

593
00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:54.270
ordered entails,
can limitation that puts on what's possible.

594
00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:59.850
But the other,
and you might not buy that cause you,
you might,

595
00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:03.450
you might say if we had time to go back and forth,
you might,
you might just say,

596
00:42:03.451 --> 00:42:08.080
I just know him by that states could protect themselves from um,

597
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:12.990
independence without wiping out the independence.
They could,

598
00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:16.500
you know,
have policies of containment.

599
00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:19.340
I even wrote a book about that so you could,

600
00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:24.240
we could go back and forth about that.
Um,
but I think the other thing that,

601
00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:27.750
that Nozick might say two to Robert Paul Wolff is this,

602
00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:34.610
it,
they involve buying the critique of the social contract metaphor.

603
00:42:34.611 --> 00:42:37.100
He would say,
well,

604
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:43.630
we're behaving as though not having collective action is really an option.

605
00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.270
But it isn't because

606
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:53.770
it's always the case that we have some collective action regime.

607
00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:57.710
Just question is just which one.
So

608
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:05.870
in any given situation,
if you require unanimity,

609
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:09.740
you privilege the status quo.
We know that,
right?

610
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:16.020
The garbage in,
garbage out problem.
And

611
00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:21.630
if some people want to have a state and some people don't want to have a state.

612
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:23.520
If you start with a state,

613
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:27.780
then requiring unanimity to change,

614
00:43:27.781 --> 00:43:31.800
it harms the people who don't want to state.

615
00:43:31.801 --> 00:43:35.700
But if you start without a state and requiring unanimity to change it,

616
00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:37.260
it harms the people where the state.

617
00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:42.530
So in either case you're going to be harming somebody writes a violating

618
00:43:44.071 --> 00:43:46.680
somebody's rights.
So

619
00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:54.180
the bottom line is that anarchy,

620
00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:57.610
even if it existed,
if we,
if we had Anna chasm,

621
00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.840
what didn't meet Wolf's criterion

622
00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:06.330
of respecting everybody's
autonomy,

623
00:44:06.331 --> 00:44:08.700
because there would be some people who didn't want that.

624
00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:15.930
Okay,
I'm going to,
we got two minutes left,
so I'm going to leave you

625
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:20.420
with it.
What's the beginning of a deep,

626
00:44:20.421 --> 00:44:23.850
a puzzle about Nozick that will,
uh,

627
00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:25.740
pick up on Monday with

628
00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:30.520
you could say,
okay,

629
00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:35.900
we'll grant it will grant everything you're saying.
No,
Zack.

630
00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:39.203
But then

631
00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:46.070
what if

632
00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:53.420
people start to say,
okay,
we're not minimal state,
you know,

633
00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:59.440
but a lot of us are afraid of unemployment.

634
00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:02.590
We see recessions come and go.

635
00:45:02.591 --> 00:45:06.610
Or employment can suddenly shoot up to 10% I could lose every,

636
00:45:06.611 --> 00:45:11.170
I could lose my job,
not be able to pay my mortgage.
That fair.

637
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:16.380
That fear reduces a lot about utility.

638
00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:22.500
So

639
00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:28.370
we're going to create unemployment insurance

640
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:36.500
and some people don't like it.
Some people would rather take the risk,

641
00:45:36.501 --> 00:45:40.640
internalize their risk,
but you know what they were going to treat them.

642
00:45:40.641 --> 00:45:44.630
And just the way you treat independence.
So we're going to say,

643
00:45:44.631 --> 00:45:48.320
well we know you don't like funding on employment insurance.

644
00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:52.490
You'd rather internalize the risk,
but you know what,
there are a lot more of us.

645
00:45:52.491 --> 00:45:55.660
And then there are you and we,

646
00:45:55.661 --> 00:46:00.170
we believe we could compensate you for the cost.

647
00:46:00.171 --> 00:46:03.410
And in principle,
of course we don't compensate in practice.

648
00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:08.680
We believe we could compensate you in principle for the rights violation of

649
00:46:08.841 --> 00:46:09.680
forcing you.

650
00:46:09.681 --> 00:46:13.040
Who doesn't want to pay for unemployment insurance to pay for an employment

651
00:46:13.041 --> 00:46:16.190
insurance and still be better off.

652
00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:19.100
So tough luck.

653
00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:23.330
You're going to pay for unemployment insurance and then all of us will be

654
00:46:23.331 --> 00:46:27.650
happier because we'll be back on us a higher indifference curve then when we

655
00:46:27.651 --> 00:46:29.180
were,
uh,

656
00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:33.110
worrying about what might happen if we lose our job.

657
00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:36.120
And so the trouble with you nosy,

658
00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:41.140
cause you're too clever for your own God because either your argument doesn't

659
00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.470
establish enough where it's establishes too much.

660
00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:50.420
Because if we give you this type of reasoning to get to the minimum state,

661
00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:54.740
we can hijack exactly the same reasoning to get to the welfare state.

662
00:46:55.130 --> 00:47:00.130
We can just put it in this idiom of compensation for fear

663
00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:06.710
and we can justify a more extensive state then you want.

664
00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:12.310
And so either your argument doesn't get you the minimum state or gets you too

665
00:47:12.981 --> 00:47:17.570
much of a state.
Okay,
we'll start with that next time.
