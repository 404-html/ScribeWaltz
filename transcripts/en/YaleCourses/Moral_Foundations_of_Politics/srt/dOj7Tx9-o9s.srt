1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,750
So in Monday's lecture,

2
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:08,751
we let something slip by all of us without
a comment that we probably should not

3
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:13,350
have let slip by. And it's
something I want to focus on today.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,930
That is when we spelled out mill's harm
principle. I said, does everybody, sure.

5
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:23,040
They know what it means. Nevermind
whether you agree with it or not,

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,280
but whether you sure that you
understand what he's saying.

7
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:29,400
And we all agreed that
at least it was clear.

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,290
In fact though,

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,520
it's ambiguous and this is the highlighted
phrase here is the ambiguity I want

10
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,530
to focus on.
Um,

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:46,200
at the end of that long paragraph, I
read you when we, when Miller saying,

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,553
um,

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,530
if you think something's bad for
somebody or that they shouldn't do it,

14
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:56,160
remember I give you the x gave you the
example of going to law school when I

15
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:58,760
don't think it's good for you.
Um,

16
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,940
mill says those may be good reasons
for romance straighting with them or

17
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:05,340
reasoning with him or
persuading him or treating him,

18
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:10,470
but not for compelling him or visiting
him with any evil in case he decided to

19
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:13,710
do otherwise.
To justify that,

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,690
I need to justify forcing somebody to do
something or prohibiting somebody from

21
00:01:18,691 --> 00:01:23,160
doing something. The conduct from
Wishard is desired to deter him,

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,370
must be calculated to produce evil,

23
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:31,371
to someone else must be calculated
to produce evil from someone else.

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,960
And there are two issues raised by that
phrase that I really want us to focus on

25
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:42,690
with laser like intensity.
In today's lecture,

26
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,760
the one is signaled by the passive
voice in it must be calculated with that

27
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:52,530
obviously puts on the table who
does the calculating, right?

28
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,320
And secondly,
what does it mean calculated?

29
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:03,090
It could be, it could mean
calculated as he an intended.

30
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,520
I didn't intend to harm you.

31
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:09,160
There was no calculation to
harm you when I got parallel,

32
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:12,150
literally drunk behind the wheel of a car.

33
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,450
And then I don't even remember putting
the keys in the wheel and driving out.

34
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,260
I didn't intend to harm you,
right?

35
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,350
Or is it a third party calculation,
um,

36
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,450
by again,
then we get to the question by whom?

37
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,410
Who's going to decide who's
going to do the calculating?

38
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,680
So what is calculated actually mean
and who is it that's going to do the

39
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:40,830
calculating? Those are the things
we're going to zero in on today.

40
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:45,570
And I thought the best way into
it was to consider some examples.

41
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,550
And when I left you with on Monday
was what about prostitution?

42
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,520
This is what is sometimes referred
to as a so called victimless crime.

43
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,960
After all,
um,

44
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,440
the chance action between the tropic
prostitute and a client is a parade.

45
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:07,330
Oh, superior transaction. Right?

46
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,760
It's a voluntary market transaction.

47
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,920
They wouldn't do it if it didn't
make both people better off.

48
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,170
Um, so should we just say
from male's point of view,

49
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,210
there's no harm here.

50
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,210
Truly is a victimless crime and we
shouldn't make things at all if they are

51
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,950
victimized.
How many people think that makes sense?

52
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,920
I about half the thanks. That doesn't
make sense. Nobody. Yeah. Okay.

53
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:41,200
So what, why, why doesn't it makes sense?

54
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:43,870
Somebody who thinks it doesn't make sense,

55
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,940
why is it not the over here?
You,

56
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,930
why were you thinking
it didn't make sense?

57
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,453
Okay.

58
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,140
Um,
even though it's victimless,

59
00:03:58,141 --> 00:04:03,141
I think there's harming yourself
has some sort of implications.

60
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:04,440
I think there's this, oh, it's that

61
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,570
prostitute harming herself

62
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,740
sort of. I think I just like some moral
implications in there. Let's be going.

63
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,970
What kinds of implications?
Um,

64
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,023
yeah,

65
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,350
besides just like harming, I don't think
I said, okay, let me take that back.

66
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,050
Harming herself.

67
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:25,690
It might harm society in the sense
that it brings down society's a moral

68
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,540
standard.

69
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,980
Okay. It might harm society. Um,

70
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:36,050
males very clear that he wants to reject
the idea that there were social rights.

71
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,370
So, so he wouldn't accept that. But I
don't think you should give up so quickly.

72
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,890
Um,
is,

73
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,540
is there some other way of articulating
what you have in mind there?

74
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:50,510
When you say harm society,
what do you mean?

75
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,870
What if you unpack?
What does it mean when you really,

76
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,130
when you say harm society,
it's tricky.

77
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,560
Anyone else want to have a go?
Yeah, right behind you. Um,

78
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,280
I guess it poses a negative
externality on society. Okay.

79
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,710
What is the negative externality?
We'll,

80
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:12,080
I guess in the case of
prostitution and could be, um,

81
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,700
the objectification of women in this case,
objectification of women.

82
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,070
Okay. And that, that,

83
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,253
yep.

84
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,620
How would we say that's a harm to society?

85
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,680
Maybe it would be,
again,

86
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:31,090
a male's cannot reject the idea that
society has a right not to be harmed so

87
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:31,600
high.

88
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,250
How can it play out in a way that
doesn't involve making that plan?

89
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,510
It's society.

90
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,913
Okay.

91
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,000
Well,
I guess it,

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,990
you could say it poses a
negative externality on the
individuals and the society

93
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,500
by him August on women on women play
and it poses a negative externality on

94
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:55,190
women at reinforces a set of
stereotypes and so on. Okay.

95
00:05:55,191 --> 00:06:00,191
So that might be one way in
which prostitution causes harm.

96
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,090
Any other ways?
Yes sir.

97
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:03,801
Um,

98
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:07,910
it could also be said that
it is a negative extra
nowaday because it undermines

99
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:08,900
family values.

100
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,980
It undermines fat family value,

101
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,390
which would then in turn like
hurt children and like the future

102
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,610
that would in turn her children.

103
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:19,883
Yeah.

104
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:25,710
Um, well I think it's difficult also
to just connect prostitution from the,

105
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,830
like this sort of theoretical model
from the actual model of prostitution.

106
00:06:28,831 --> 00:06:30,710
I think when we put sort of,
you know,

107
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,360
pimps in sexual slavery and that
sort of thing into the picture,

108
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:38,361
then the harm becomes far more real and
it's questionable whether people are,

109
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:43,140
um, voluntarily participating in
these transactions to begin with.

110
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,270
Okay. So if you are really hard
boiled million libertarian,

111
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,500
I think why slavery is not an issue,
slaves or taken by force,

112
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,780
but, um, selling yourself
into indentured servitude,

113
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,640
not obviously something would Melsa
you should be allowed to do that.

114
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:10,700
Your choice
Trekkie was,

115
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:14,480
you're really giving up your, you're,
you're really giving up your Tonomy.

116
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:18,890
It's sort of, you'll see in politics,
we can front later in the course,

117
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,250
what do you do with an election where a
party runs as in Algeria in 1991 sang if

118
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:28,820
elected, we are going to abolish
democracy and they get elected,

119
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,270
uh,
should that,

120
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,870
you know, in the, in that
case, the Algerian military
stepped in. But, so should,

121
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:40,550
if somebody says, I'm going to sell myself
into servitude, it's a voluntary act,

122
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,790
should we save them from this themself?

123
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:45,360
Okay.

124
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,190
That,
that's a very tricky one.

125
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,380
But let's set those ones aside and I
think there would be similar issues with

126
00:07:52,381 --> 00:07:53,730
suicide for mail.

127
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,570
Should you allow it be allowed to
stop people committing suicide?

128
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,690
Those are very hard. I think. Um,

129
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,310
there's separate though from these issues
about what we're calling externalities.

130
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,720
People are saying, of course there are
harmful effects of prostitution. It,

131
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,030
it harms women.
Um,

132
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:16,690
it may undermine certain
kinds of moral codes. Um,

133
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,750
what would males say in response to that?

134
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:20,803
Yeah.

135
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,060
Well, I think for me it really
depends on the context of an act.

136
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:30,870
So you can be drunk at home, but you
can't be a policemen drunk on the job.

137
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,730
So if we look at prostitution, if you're,
you know, working as a free agent,

138
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:39,870
sure you can engage in prostitution,
but if you're a father and you're married,

139
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,170
then he would probably view
that as something not okay.

140
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:48,450
So it really matters for him what the
context is of a certain transaction.

141
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,430
Okay. I think that's, that's right.

142
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:56,431
And you could imagine a more refined
version of the harm that tried to

143
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,180
incorporate that.
I gave the example last time,

144
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:05,181
I think I said male would presumably be
completely comfortable with outgrowing

145
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:07,040
drunk driving,
uh,

146
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:11,990
and punishing that activity but not
punishing drinking. So presumably, uh,

147
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,800
you know, the principal would be,
be some version of interfere with,

148
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,840
with human conduct as, as little as
possible to prevent harm. Right. So you,

149
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,710
it's,
it's,

150
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,810
it's killing a Gnat with a sledgehammer
to outlawed drinking just because some

151
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:30,170
people drive drunk. I think
that's fair enough. But,

152
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,540
but I think some of the people who are
saying allowing prostitution has big a

153
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:41,360
negative externalities wouldn't
give up that quickly. Anyone.

154
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:46,200
We think we shouldn't give up that
quickly. That there's something else here.

155
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,720
Nobody,
maybe they would give up that quick.

156
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,673
Yeah.

157
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,770
Okay. Well we'll, we'll just, we'll leave
that aside for a minute, but, uh, and,

158
00:09:59,771 --> 00:10:02,310
and come back to it.
So

159
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,210
if you, if you, if you now bearing
this in mind, go back and reread,

160
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,310
um, on liberty. I think what
you'll come away with is,

161
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:16,080
it's actually quite confusing.

162
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,590
Just what mail means by harm,

163
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,700
because that some harms he
wants to say are trivial harms.

164
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:29,150
So the harm you Safa through
not getting a place in college,

165
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,860
in a competitive exam, right?
He's knocking out loud.

166
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,170
That harm ultimately to be dispositive,

167
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:42,171
it's going to allow that to be
outweighed by the benefits to society of

168
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:45,770
competitive meritocracy.
Uh,

169
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:49,770
and remember our three
straight discussion last time.

170
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:54,720
So some harms are more significant
than other harms and some harms are

171
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,570
outweighed by utilitarian benefits.

172
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,550
It seems like some of the time if he's,
you know,

173
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:04,770
mail saying,
um,

174
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:12,050
prohibition shouldn't be allowed.
He's saying essentially, you know,

175
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,560
unless I intend to do you some harm,

176
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,480
you might find it offensive that
I sit around drinking all day.

177
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,270
But you know,
it's not know your business.

178
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,980
You might have family values which say,
um,

179
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,980
uh,
that,

180
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:35,270
that if there are people out
there who are prostitutes,

181
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,810
it undermines the family. That's your
family value. Thank you very much.

182
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:43,400
It's not my family value, right? So you
could take that view. And after all,

183
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:44,390
if you think about the,

184
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:49,391
the debate we've had in this country
about gay marriage over the past decade or

185
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:54,370
so, that's exactly what the, the claim and
the counterclaim, right? Some people say,

186
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,510
um,

187
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,020
there's no reason in the world that gay
people should be prevented from getting

188
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:03,700
married. They're not hurting anybody else.
Uh, and then, you know, people say, well,

189
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:08,370
that undermines traditional family
values, right? And the, the,

190
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,650
the people who support gay
marriage say, well, so what,

191
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,960
those are your traditional family values,

192
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:18,130
but they're not out traditional
family values. And why should yours?

193
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:23,050
This is awful. The what mill says the
tyranny of majority opinions. So what,

194
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,470
right. This is supposed to protect
individual freedom against,

195
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:29,870
okay?

196
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,990
So one person's traditional family
values is another person's tyranny of a

197
00:12:33,991 --> 00:12:36,830
majority opinion.
How are you going to resolve that?

198
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:41,000
What mechanisms does smell
have to resolve that?

199
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:46,870
And I think you could read on liberty
with a fine tooth comb and not come up

200
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,374
with one.

201
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:49,780
Okay?

202
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,000
And so you could say,
well,

203
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,210
so much the worst for male.

204
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,970
We thought we had this wonderful reits,
utilities synthesis,

205
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,490
you know,
we're all good things would go together.

206
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,970
We could respect individual
freedoms and promotes social,

207
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:11,920
a utilitarian efficiency based
on science all at the same time.

208
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,580
But actually it turns out to all be,
uh,

209
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,550
resting on a hail of sand.

210
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:23,410
And the minute you walk on
it, you start sinking. Um,

211
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,420
and I think this is a,

212
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:30,450
this is a good time to go back to the
point I made to you right at the beginning

213
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:34,720
of the course when I said,
um,

214
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,890
you shouldn't be expecting the
sell silver bullet in this course.

215
00:13:38,891 --> 00:13:43,891
You shouldn't be expecting to find the
theory that answers all your questions.

216
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:49,830
What instead you're going to find this
particular insights that you can pick up

217
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:53,200
and put into your bag of
tricks and move on with,

218
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:58,650
because I think it is at the end of the
day a good critique of mill to say there

219
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:04,381
is no single definition of harm and
there's no good account of who makes the

220
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:09,200
decisions about harm. Uh,
and so to that extent, um,

221
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,470
his claim at the beginning of on liberty,

222
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:15,430
that there's one simple principle
and this is what it is, fails.

223
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,870
Nonetheless,

224
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:22,930
there's some important and
enduring insights here that
I think we're not getting

225
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,540
one to let go off.
One is

226
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,710
okay.

227
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:33,600
When you think about all of the ways human
beings interact and all of the things

228
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:38,601
we do that cause us to have the
possibility of bumping into one another,

229
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:44,450
maybe it shouldn't be the case that there
is a single definition of harm because

230
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:48,130
different definitions of harm

231
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,130
are relevant to different

232
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,360
types of situation.

233
00:14:53,361 --> 00:14:57,590
This is a little like the point somebody
here made that Mel would be interested

234
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,450
in the context.
If you think about,

235
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,313
um,

236
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:06,980
physicians,

237
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:12,340
we allow physicians to buy malpractice
insurance in case they kill you by

238
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:15,230
mistake when they're doing surgery.

239
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:21,490
But we don't allow bank robbers to buy
malpractice insurance so that if they

240
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:27,920
kill you by mistake when they're
robbing a bank, they can, they can, uh,

241
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,650
get off.
That tells you right there,

242
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:35,950
there must be different conceptions
of harm that operate in different

243
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:37,880
circumstances.
And indeed,

244
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:41,780
if you want to start thinking
about it a little bit more, uh,

245
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:46,810
systematically harm is treated very
differently in different situations.

246
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:54,070
Think about this continuum I've
put up here some kinds of harm.

247
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,380
Arec, completely excluded. You're not,

248
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:02,330
you're not held responsible for them at
all. If, if you have a death penalty,

249
00:16:02,331 --> 00:16:05,390
a Neagle execution of people,
of course you harm the person,

250
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:09,800
you execute certain kinds of,
of wartime killing.

251
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:13,730
Of course you harm the person
that you kill. But we allow it.

252
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,390
We don't count it as a relevant harm.

253
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,690
Then here I'm going down this continuum.

254
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:33,300
We say that the intention to kill is
very important in the criminal law.

255
00:16:34,151 --> 00:16:36,550
We have this idea,
anyone know what this term,

256
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,870
mens rea is and the criminal law,
no reason you should,

257
00:16:40,871 --> 00:16:41,770
but somebody might.

258
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,410
Yeah.

259
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:44,860
If,

260
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:49,860
if you're charging somebody
with a criminal offense
that the government has to

261
00:16:50,471 --> 00:16:52,210
prove beyond a reasonable doubt,

262
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:56,770
various elements of the crime
that the person did it, um,

263
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,503
that,

264
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:03,910
that there was in fact that the crime
occurred and that there was something

265
00:17:03,911 --> 00:17:08,710
called the mens rea or criminal
intent, guilty mind. That's,

266
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,700
that's what it means.

267
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:14,920
I'm in the criminal law when we make
that one of the elements of the crime.

268
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,540
That's why

269
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:23,060
things like the insanity defense becomes
so contentious because the person

270
00:17:23,231 --> 00:17:28,180
claims, while I didn't have, because
I didn't know what I was doing,

271
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:31,600
I didn't have mens rea.
My client didn't have man's dre.

272
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,220
He didn't know what he was doing,

273
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,300
so he's not guilty by reason
of insanity is not guilty.

274
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:43,120
Okay. Or if you think
about, you might say,

275
00:17:43,121 --> 00:17:44,560
well we do,

276
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,740
we do imprison people for Valet vehicular
homicide when they get drunk and the

277
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:54,150
person says,
but I didn't intend to kill them.

278
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,260
I didn't know that I, I didn't know I
was driving. How can you say intended?

279
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:03,240
Interestingly, there we come up with
a doctrine of in the legal system,

280
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,100
which we call constructive intent and
what is the doctrine of a construct of

281
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:10,640
intent. It's basically we say, well,

282
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,380
any reasonable person would know that if
you drive down to a bar and you have no

283
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:20,190
way to get home and you
then drink 10 beers,

284
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,990
you would be,

285
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,870
you would be putting yourself in
position where you could harm someone.

286
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,780
So construct,
we're going to impute the intent to you,

287
00:18:28,781 --> 00:18:30,130
even though you didn't have it.

288
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:34,990
That's the doctrine of constructive
intent that's using exactly that kind of

289
00:18:34,991 --> 00:18:35,824
situation.

290
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,710
So in the criminal law to go back to mail,

291
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:46,030
we'd say calculated to produce evil in
someone else has got to be calculated by

292
00:18:46,211 --> 00:18:49,960
the person committing the harm.
Okay.

293
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,690
So why is that? You might say, well,

294
00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:00,870
criminal actions are actions
which bring moral disapproval,

295
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,810
a program on people.
We lock them up.

296
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,690
They're really thinks we
don't want people to do.

297
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,960
And we want people to internalize
the incentive not to do them.

298
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:18,220
So it's about their intentional actions
and then we punish them for those

299
00:19:18,221 --> 00:19:22,750
actions. And therefore,
um, we want, when we,

300
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:27,490
when we put sanctions on them,
we want them to know,

301
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:32,410
uh,
that they could have behaved otherwise.

302
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,500
And so we want the intent to be pricing.

303
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,790
So construct them in Canada
is sort of like intent,

304
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,530
but not exactly

305
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,360
what about negligence.

306
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,800
Negligence is even less
like constructive intent.

307
00:19:50,801 --> 00:19:55,801
So negligence is the doctrine that let's
suppose you're living in a neighborhood

308
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:58,330
where there are lots of children,

309
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,660
well children and you put
in a swimming pool. Um, and,

310
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:09,690
and let's say the law requires that there
be your fence and your swimming pool,

311
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,210
but you leave the,
you leave the fence,

312
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,110
open the gate open and
at child goes hand in,

313
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,000
falls into your pool and drowns.

314
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,810
The doctrine of negligence would say,
well yeah,

315
00:20:23,811 --> 00:20:27,610
she of course you're dating in 10 the
that the child would drown but you were

316
00:20:27,611 --> 00:20:31,900
negligent and leaving your door open or
you're, you're leaving the gate open.

317
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,470
So we're going to hold you responsible.
So it's,

318
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,030
it's a little less than constructive
intent. It's negligent. You were,

319
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,580
any reasonable person would know that

320
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,490
you shouldn't leave the
gate open. So you were, um,

321
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,020
it's still a state of mind, but it's
obviously not the same thing. Um,

322
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,213
as

323
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,440
intending to kill the child.

324
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,450
And then we could go even further
down the continuum and say, you know,

325
00:21:03,451 --> 00:21:05,820
there's some situations where we say,

326
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,240
we don't care about your
state of mind at all.

327
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:14,760
So if an adult has sex with a 14 year old

328
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,983
yeah.

329
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,410
And walks in and says,
well your honor,

330
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,500
she said she was 20 and
I thought she was 20,

331
00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:26,550
she looked 20 and,
and perhaps that's true.

332
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,400
Perhaps all of those things were true.
She said she was 20.

333
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:33,420
I thought she was 20 and she looked 20.
We don't care.

334
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,850
We say as a society,
we don't care.

335
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:38,710
Okay.

336
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,020
That's the notion of statutory rape.

337
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:44,050
It's or sometimes called strict liability.

338
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,000
We're going to hold you liable anyway.
And why do we do that?

339
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:54,270
Presumably to give people the incentive
to make sure to as defined out.

340
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,410
Um,

341
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:01,410
so when we say if she was 14 it statutory
rape or if he was 14 and she was 20,

342
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:06,310
it's statutory right?
There it is. Uh, too bad.

343
00:22:06,311 --> 00:22:11,160
We don't care what she said. And, um,

344
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,890
we don't care what you, you believed
at the time because we want to,

345
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:20,980
to ensure that people have the
incentive to find that out correctly.

346
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,850
Or we could think of Good Samaritan laws.

347
00:22:28,851 --> 00:22:33,851
This is the situation where you're walking
along a and you see somebody drowning

348
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:39,500
in a lake and had very little cost
to yourself. You could pull them out,

349
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,790
but you say, you know, I'm
late for class and my mind,

350
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,700
your, you know, I didn't
push you in the lake.

351
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,220
In many states we have good
Samaritan laws, which if it,

352
00:22:52,221 --> 00:22:56,270
if it really wasn't no trivial cost
to yourself, you could have done that.

353
00:22:56,271 --> 00:22:59,840
You can be prosecuted for failing to

354
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,480
assist somebody in need of your help.
Okay.

355
00:23:05,481 --> 00:23:10,481
So that's obviously a very
capacious definition of harm.

356
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,640
I mean,
after all,

357
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,720
the fact that we're all sitting here
rather than doing relief work in Haiti

358
00:23:20,721 --> 00:23:25,721
right now means presumably
that some people are suffering,

359
00:23:27,201 --> 00:23:32,120
perhaps even dying as a result of
our failure to go to Haiti right now.

360
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,500
So it,

361
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:39,530
once you go over this line
into set treating omissions
to help as a form of harm

362
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,870
as we do with good Samaritan laws,
where will it end?

363
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,933
Right?

364
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:52,090
So you can see from this that if you
wanted one definition of harm to cover all

365
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:58,160
situations, that obviously isn't
gonna make any sense. Nonetheless,

366
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,380
if you, it, you think
about this continuum, um,

367
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,190
where you fall on,

368
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,520
it has huge implications for how
you're gonna run your society.

369
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,870
And more interestingly than that,
these things,

370
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,960
this, I've given you a
kind of static picture now,

371
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,300
but these things actually change.

372
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,350
Think about the drug thalidomide.

373
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,630
Who knows what happened
with the letter mine. Yeah.

374
00:24:30,631 --> 00:24:31,830
What happened with the later mine.

375
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,683
Okay.

376
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,560
Um,
it came out in the late fifties.

377
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:40,740
It was used to treat morning
sickness and it turns out that, uh,

378
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,850
the re-estimate of the drug,
uh,

379
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,740
causes teratoma and children
born to women taking the drug.

380
00:24:46,741 --> 00:24:51,300
And so it was basically a failure of the
drug industry to look into the effects

381
00:24:51,301 --> 00:24:55,020
of, um, the different
structures of drugs in humans.

382
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:58,630
Correct. Okay. And what's,
that's a very good summary.

383
00:24:58,631 --> 00:25:03,280
And what's interesting about thalidomide
from our point of view is that the,

384
00:25:03,281 --> 00:25:08,140
in developing this drug which was
given for morning sickness, um,

385
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,850
the comp, the drug, the pharmaceutical
companies didn't cut any corners.

386
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:18,100
They did all that,
the clinical trials correctly,

387
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:22,840
they got the FDA approvals, everything
was done by the book. There was not,

388
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,930
there was no, uh,
nothing illicit was done.

389
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:31,520
And at that time,
the general stand it

390
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,580
in tort liability.
That is tort tort does,

391
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:41,290
who knows what tort means?
T O r t not T. O. R. T. A.

392
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:44,020
We're not talking about chocolate cake.
What's a tort?

393
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:51,110
Nobody knows what a tort is
toward. Just means harm, right?

394
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,160
So the general standard for Tort
liability was negligence and

395
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,790
they weren't negligent. They did
it by the book. They got all,

396
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:09,530
they got all of the approvals,
they got the clinical trials,

397
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:11,510
the FDA approved the drug.

398
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:17,350
And it's a famous case because it was an
instrument by which the courts decided

399
00:26:20,091 --> 00:26:23,960
to say, you know what? We don't care.

400
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:29,340
We don't care. They moved
from negligence, negligence,

401
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,890
strict liability. We don't care
that you did it. All right.

402
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,880
The fact is there are all of
these children who are born with

403
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,940
missing limbs and you're going to pay you,

404
00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:49,140
the drug companies are going to pay.
We're going to hold you strictly liable.

405
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:53,760
We're going to treat it like the
example I gave before statutory.

406
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,500
Right now you might say, well
why, why would you do that?

407
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,870
And interestingly,

408
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,900
the the move in American tort law
from negligence to strict liability,

409
00:27:09,141 --> 00:27:12,490
those of you who go to go on
from here to the yell loss go,

410
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,340
we'll learn all about it
because the intellectual,

411
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:21,420
a giant of the move from the negligence
to strict liability was Guido Kalibrasi,

412
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,590
longtime dean of the Yale Law School
and now a federal judge on the second

413
00:27:27,591 --> 00:27:29,420
circuit.
Um,

414
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:34,540
he wrote a book called the
costs of accidents and the
main argument of the costs

415
00:27:34,671 --> 00:27:38,450
of accidents, it was, this was
actually about auto accidents.

416
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,960
It was essentially utilitarian in that
caliber breezy looked at free for,

417
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:46,843
um,

418
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:48,920
okay,

419
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,390
what had already started in,
in New Jersey at that time.

420
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,620
If people rear end one another in,
in cars,

421
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,090
you can say, well, what,
who was negligent care?

422
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,820
Was it the driver in front or
why is it the dryer in the back?

423
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:07,220
If it was the driver
in the front, why? Oh,

424
00:28:07,221 --> 00:28:11,690
well he stopped too quickly or
something like that. Will, you know, uh,

425
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,510
something like that. Or the
driver at the back says, well,

426
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:15,890
my brakes weren't working.

427
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:20,180
Or the driver at the front light brake
lights weren't working or something like,

428
00:28:20,181 --> 00:28:20,421
you know,

429
00:28:20,421 --> 00:28:24,260
you have an argument and they have their
lawyer and you have your lawyer and you

430
00:28:24,261 --> 00:28:28,730
Duke it out and somebody wins and
somebody loses is how many New Jersey said

431
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,640
it's not worth it.
It's a waste of court time.

432
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,810
It's a waste of everybody's time.
So we're going to make the law,

433
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:40,740
which says in an in rear ending situation,
the car,

434
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:45,770
the driver at the back pays
always kind of rough justice.

435
00:28:47,071 --> 00:28:50,640
Sometimes. Maybe the brake lights on
the front car really weren't working.

436
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:51,780
We don't care.

437
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:56,700
It's just not worth the state of New
Jersey's time to invest in institutional

438
00:28:56,701 --> 00:29:01,701
resources and all the rest of it to allow
people to litigate these things just

439
00:29:01,831 --> 00:29:03,600
just cost too much.
It's not worth it.

440
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,080
So Guido Calabresi came up with a
little algorithm in which he said the

441
00:29:09,451 --> 00:29:14,451
standards should be to minimize the costs
of accidents plus the costs of their

442
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:18,660
avoidance.
So you figure out the costs of,

443
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:23,550
of all the rear ending, right? And then
you say to yours and then you figure out,

444
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:28,140
well, if we allow people to, so what's
the cost of avoiding accidents that way?

445
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,980
Whereas if we allow, if we don't
allow them to sue for negligence,

446
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:36,580
what's the cost? That way it's cheaper.
It's more efficient and anyway,

447
00:29:36,581 --> 00:29:38,460
way probably property.
Some good side benefits.

448
00:29:38,461 --> 00:29:42,070
It gives the person at the back the
right incentive to keep a distance.

449
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:45,310
They can stop, right? Uh,

450
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,550
so we make a utilitarian judge chess not,
you know,

451
00:29:48,551 --> 00:29:51,280
the game's not worth the
candle for negligence.

452
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:53,720
Hmm.

453
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,370
That's one defense. Hobbit. Um,
coming back to the thalidomide,

454
00:29:58,371 --> 00:30:02,000
minimize the costs of accidents
and the costs of their avoidance.

455
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,280
What do we want as a society?

456
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,640
We want the drug companies to have the
incentive to go the extra mile to do even

457
00:30:09,861 --> 00:30:10,850
more research.

458
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:15,650
Then they didn't have to do restaurant
Clyde by the FDA to buy the insurance

459
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,800
because perhaps they're
the deepest pocket.

460
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:24,380
They have the resources to do the
research and to buy the insurance.

461
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,200
If you're thinking about
if you're a pregnant woman,

462
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:30,770
thinking about taking a morning
sickness pill or not taking it,

463
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,510
you don't have the resources
to do extra research. Um,

464
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:36,580
okay.

465
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,480
So we put,

466
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:42,990
we put the burden on the party
who can most cheaply avoid it.

467
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,950
Now the drug companies, that's
outrageous. It's totally outrageous.

468
00:30:47,951 --> 00:30:52,420
We didn't do anything wrong. And
you're punishing us. Strict liability.

469
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,410
So we moved and,

470
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,230
and the example of thalidomide is just
a tip of an iceberg and the hall of Tort

471
00:30:59,231 --> 00:30:59,501
Law,

472
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:04,501
there's been this 30 or 40 year move
from a negligence standard to a strict

473
00:31:06,911 --> 00:31:08,440
liability standard NF.

474
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,480
Fascinating intellectual debate between
Kalibrasi who is the champion of strict

475
00:31:13,631 --> 00:31:18,160
liability and Richard Posner, who you
will probably have read some of his books,

476
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:23,530
a judge and the Chicago circuit who
defends negligence as more efficient.

477
00:31:24,761 --> 00:31:28,810
So it's an, it's a debate between
utilitarians in that sense. And if,

478
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:33,100
if we had more time,
I would have you read some of that debate.

479
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:37,200
Um,
but as a matter of the,

480
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,800
you might say,

481
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,670
you might be convinced at the end of
it that Posner winds intellectually,

482
00:31:42,671 --> 00:31:46,450
but as a matter of the politics of it,
Kalibrasi wins.

483
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,840
That is to say American tort law has
moved since the 1950s away from strict

484
00:31:55,401 --> 00:31:59,660
liability, uh, away from
negligence, strict liability.

485
00:31:59,661 --> 00:32:01,310
Let's think of another example.

486
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:07,910
In the 1950s in America,

487
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,950
a high spend could not be
prosecuted for raping his wife.

488
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:18,720
There was no such crime.
It was, in other words,

489
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:23,040
a conclusive common law presumption
that there was no such crime.

490
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:27,630
Now, you might say, why? While
there's a historical answer,

491
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:32,660
a went back to then the suspension of
the legal identity of the woman during

492
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:35,754
marriage,

493
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:40,070
essentially all it goes back
to the old patriarchal laws.

494
00:32:40,071 --> 00:32:42,890
The daughter was more or
less the father's property,

495
00:32:42,891 --> 00:32:47,210
and then he gave his property
to the son in law as,

496
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:52,280
as the husband's property.
So the woman didn't,

497
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:57,050
didn't have a legal identity as a
person during marriage. And this is why,

498
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:01,010
uh, she lost control
of her property. Right.

499
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:05,090
And that was restored ultimately by
the myriad woman's property acts,

500
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,283
um,

501
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:11,380
that re recreated a women's property
rights of a say inherited wealth or

502
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:16,310
whatever it was. It didn't automatically
become her husband's property,

503
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,840
but there was this hang of a
from the 19th century that,

504
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,733
um,

505
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,060
okay,

506
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:27,230
a woman, a woman couldn't
be right by her husband, uh,

507
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:32,200
and not only write but other things
like assault. So in other words, uh,

508
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:37,220
a woman you could walk up to a woman
you are not married to on the street and

509
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:42,941
punch her in the face and get arrested
for that and convicted of assault.

510
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,190
But if you did it to your wife,
there was no crime.

511
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,280
So then we have,

512
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,490
yeah,

513
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,690
the women's movement,

514
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:57,100
we have a lot of feminists
pressure an organization.

515
00:33:57,101 --> 00:34:02,020
And so we now have gone
to a world in which, um,

516
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:07,050
marital rape is a felony in about 45
of the states and the federal system.

517
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:13,750
So it's gone from being,
having a conclusive common
law presumption against it,

518
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:18,460
to making it a felony. And all the
other things have gone as well.

519
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:22,090
So into spousal tort,
immunity is gone. Uh,

520
00:34:22,091 --> 00:34:25,510
you can be prosecuted for assaulting.
In other words,

521
00:34:25,511 --> 00:34:27,550
marriage is no longer a bar.

522
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,870
Two things that would be
criminal actions outside. So we,

523
00:34:31,871 --> 00:34:36,871
we've had a huge change in the law there
from one definition of what counts as

524
00:34:38,311 --> 00:34:43,311
are relevant harm to a
different definition of what
counts as irrelevant harm.

525
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,900
In the first case,
it was an argument about efficiency.

526
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:49,630
And the second is a political movement.
Uh,

527
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:54,631
the women's movement had this enormous
impact on the redefinition of what sorts

528
00:34:56,651 --> 00:35:00,700
of harms the state should
take seriously in marriage.

529
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,850
Let me give you a third example.

530
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,543
Okay.

531
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:14,780
If you go into employment
law, housing law, um,

532
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,540
or education,

533
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,103
mmm.

534
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:23,810
The American courts have for many decades,

535
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,840
at least since Brown vs board of
education was a handed down by a unanimous

536
00:35:29,691 --> 00:35:32,120
supreme court in 1954.

537
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:36,080
They've been concerned with trying
to get rid of discrimination.

538
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:41,760
Discrimination is a kind of harm,
right?

539
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:47,400
So the question is,
what do you have to show?

540
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,580
What do you have to show to convince
the court that you been harmed?

541
00:35:53,581 --> 00:35:56,640
Initially there should be a remedy.
What do you have to shout?

542
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,050
And during the Warren Court,

543
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,100
it was somewhat like strict liability.
The Warren Court,

544
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:13,180
all Warren was appointed by
President Eisenhower in 1953.

545
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,890
Eisenhower authority was
appointing a conservative justice,

546
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,140
but he turned out to be wrong.
Oh,

547
00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:22,820
Warren was perhaps the most liberal,
uh,

548
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,560
chief justice of the 20th century.

549
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,630
And He, the, the court under his,

550
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,920
under his leadership,
uh,

551
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,200
develop the idea that all you had to
do was show there was a pattern of

552
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:42,000
discriminatory effects.

553
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:47,540
You didn't have to show that any buddy
intended to discriminate against anyone.

554
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:52,620
So in the education area,
separate but equal,

555
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,460
the court said is inherently unequal.
It doesn't,

556
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:01,550
we're not saying that
that white southerners are
necessarily prejudice against

557
00:37:02,881 --> 00:37:07,080
blacks. Many of them were, but we don't,
we're not getting get to that question.

558
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:10,410
We just sang separate,
but equal is inherently

559
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,660
impossible. It's an oxymoron.
You can't have it. Uh,

560
00:37:15,661 --> 00:37:19,170
and we were saying that without
reference to the intentions of school

561
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:23,170
administrators or anybody else, um, in,

562
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,440
in housing patterns,

563
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,960
if you see, um, you know,

564
00:37:29,961 --> 00:37:34,250
you do these kinds of studies
like ens and the Yale law school,

565
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:38,390
he has a well known for having done,
um,

566
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:43,900
when people with exactly the
same objective characteristics,

567
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:45,950
same income,

568
00:37:45,951 --> 00:37:49,820
same employment history and
saw and going for a mortgage.

569
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:55,360
It turns out that African Americans are
denied mortgages at a higher rate than

570
00:37:55,521 --> 00:37:56,870
non African Americans.

571
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,810
You don't have to show that that mortgage
officer was a racist doors in Kandin

572
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:07,190
you just, you, you produced this
to test x. You show, you know,

573
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,900
people at these objective characteristics
who are African American get denied.

574
00:38:11,901 --> 00:38:13,330
And these are those the same act,

575
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,300
the same characteristics who are not
African Americans don't get denied.

576
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,300
It's a pattern of discriminatory effects.

577
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,690
We don't have to get into
something like man's rail,

578
00:38:23,691 --> 00:38:28,220
whatever's going on in the the
bank mortgage offices head.

579
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:33,910
So that was the standard also
in employment discrimination
and many other areas

580
00:38:34,191 --> 00:38:37,690
of the law of under the Warren Court.

581
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,720
All you had to show was a pattern of
discriminatory effects by the Warren court

582
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:49,840
was gradually replaced. First buy the
Burger court, then the rank was cord,

583
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:54,310
and now the Roberts court.
And in that conservative evolution,

584
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:59,590
discrimination law has gone
this way on the continuum.

585
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:06,700
Now you can't get a remedy unless you
can show the part the intention to

586
00:39:07,701 --> 00:39:10,610
discriminate on the part
of some public official.

587
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:16,570
So let's say in zoning ordinances,

588
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,880
you've got to show that some
public official actually
tried to do the zoning in

589
00:39:24,231 --> 00:39:28,250
such a way as to exclude blacks from
a certain neighborhood, let's say,

590
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,520
um,
before you couldn't get a remedy.

591
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,350
So an employment we've been and,

592
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:40,040
and housing and education and all
of these areas of discrimination,

593
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:45,140
we've gone the other way as a
society, right? We've gone from a,

594
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:50,060
a very capacious standed,
which would allow us,

595
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:54,140
allow our remedy just from
the objective indicators,

596
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:58,480
the patterns of discriminatory effects.
Now we treat it more like the,

597
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:03,290
the criminal law we say,
unless you can show the,

598
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,380
you can establish in
court that there was some

599
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:13,970
particular person in that bank denying
mortgages who intended to discriminate,

600
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,293
no remedy.

601
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,500
So it's much harder of
course to get remedies.

602
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,860
So those are three examples.

603
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,350
Those are three examples.
The thalidomide,

604
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:39,351
the marital rape and the discrimination
where you can see that this enormous

605
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:45,290
flux in our society as to what
counts as are relevant harm.

606
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:46,830
Yeah.

607
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:48,480
You know,
and if we had time,

608
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:54,770
I strongly suspect if we had time to
have a debate in this room on those three

609
00:40:55,351 --> 00:40:59,160
topics, it's not like we
would, we would all agree

610
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:05,640
as to, you know, whether in
discrimination law it should be

611
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:06,970
okay.

612
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:09,940
Patent has no discriminatory
effects or intent.

613
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,400
We'd have a differences
of opinion about that.

614
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:17,110
That would stem from our assumptions
about the appropriate role of government,

615
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:20,620
um,
how intrusive it should be and so on.

616
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,260
Or probably there would be less,

617
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:27,160
there would be less disagreement
today about the marital rape.

618
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:32,190
Then there would have been in the 1950s
and I suspect intuitions would go all

619
00:41:32,861 --> 00:41:36,020
over the place, uh, about

620
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,673
okay,

621
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,930
tort liability and that's the later mine.

622
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,050
So what does that tell us?

623
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,340
This is the second reason I think it's
really instructive to work through

624
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,300
somebody like Mel.
Even if in the end,

625
00:41:55,301 --> 00:41:59,130
Mel doesn't have the answer.
I think one of the,

626
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,180
the lessons of this course, and this is,
you can see it here very dramatically,

627
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,380
is that it's,
it is impossible

628
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:13,460
to get rid of political disagreement.

629
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:20,870
It is impossible to
reduce political choices,

630
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:23,630
to sign Catholic choices all the way down.

631
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:29,620
Science can play important roles
in making political choices,

632
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:32,780
but they can't,
it can't make them for us.

633
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:37,100
So that one of the big
goals of the enlightenment

634
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:44,820
to come up with scientific principles of
politics is never going to be perfectly

635
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,490
realized. That doesn't mean it
can't be partially realized,

636
00:42:48,491 --> 00:42:51,700
but it's never going to
be perfectly realize.

637
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,910
You can't ring the
politics out of politics.

638
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:01,570
There's no way to do it.
And so you know if you will,

639
00:43:01,571 --> 00:43:06,571
you will see when we come to read Marx
and he talks about his utopian communist

640
00:43:07,601 --> 00:43:10,810
society. One of his is great guys. Great.

641
00:43:10,811 --> 00:43:15,050
One Line is one of his one
liners is that politics at the,

642
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,820
at the end of the day when we finally
have the true communist Utopia,

643
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:23,920
politics will be replaced
by administration, right?

644
00:43:23,921 --> 00:43:26,920
That's a bumper sticker for saying
we're going to ring the politics out of

645
00:43:26,921 --> 00:43:28,570
politics.
Bentham,

646
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,530
okay.

647
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:34,790
Looking for the right objective,
utilitarian calculus, right?

648
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:40,400
Mel wants to say while
once the harm is triggered,

649
00:43:40,401 --> 00:43:41,660
we can bring,
we can,

650
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,670
we can do the cost benefit
analysis on scientific principles.

651
00:43:46,671 --> 00:43:50,090
We talked about that last time.
Never works.

652
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:55,370
It never works all the way
down. It doesn't mean to say
that scientific thinking,

653
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:58,340
current condition,
our normative choices,

654
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:02,600
but you'll go back and think through
these three examples that I've just given

655
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:06,770
you. These are basically
normative choices, right?

656
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,090
In the 1950s when this issue
about marital rape came up,

657
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:19,040
a lot of things were sad that a seminar
to what is said now about gay marriage,

658
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:22,910
people said,
if the state starts prosecuting husbands,

659
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,060
we're going to destroy
the traditional family.

660
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,710
You know, and people in the
women's movement said, great,

661
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,880
we're going to destroy this traditional
family because at g man shouldn't be

662
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:39,770
allowed to write women, at least in
this respect. We want to write that.

663
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:44,780
So traditional values only takes you
so far because the harm principle is,

664
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,420
you know,
by definition,

665
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,020
a critical principle for looking
at traditional values and saying,

666
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:56,490
how much should we cater to them?
How much not right?

667
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:01,000
So
these are political choices.

668
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:06,900
The choice about the letter might
has huge distributed consequences,

669
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:11,940
right? You Do, you normous
you're going to say to,

670
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:16,660
to pharmaceutical companies, you're going
to be liable from now on for the harm,

671
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:18,340
harmful effects of your drugs,

672
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:23,550
regardless of whether you got the
FDA approval that that has put,

673
00:45:23,601 --> 00:45:24,820
it's a huge,

674
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:30,640
it's a huge burden to put on them.
You notice what we could say,

675
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:34,860
we could say no.
You know,

676
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:39,870
as a famous libertarian judge
learned hand said in society losses,

677
00:45:40,421 --> 00:45:43,420
Miss Lie, where they
fall. What does that mean?

678
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,340
It basically means the women who had the
thalidomide children and the children

679
00:45:48,341 --> 00:45:52,750
themselves must internalize the loss.
Or we could say,

680
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,710
we'll socialize,
we will socialize the risk,

681
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:59,950
we'll say in in these kinds of situations

682
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:06,140
when there was no wrong doing
in the sense of cutting corners,

683
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,610
the government will bail them out.
You know,

684
00:46:10,611 --> 00:46:15,611
just like we did after nine 11 we
created this huge fund and paid paid

685
00:46:15,741 --> 00:46:18,050
compensation to people,

686
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,970
to the relatives of people who died at
nine and 11 many people die all the time

687
00:46:22,971 --> 00:46:27,200
and in disasters where we don't do that,
but we could,

688
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:32,260
we could have massive social
insurance for unexpected harms,

689
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:34,483
right?

690
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:39,010
So the choice to say losses,

691
00:46:39,011 --> 00:46:42,530
Ms lie where they fall with learning hand,
right?

692
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:47,180
Or that we should socialize it
by saying, well, if, if you,

693
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:51,710
if you are born with a physical deformity,

694
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,020
obviously it's through
no fault of your own,

695
00:46:54,021 --> 00:46:57,500
but really you can't blame the
manufacturer of thalidomide either.

696
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,650
So the state will pick it up.
We as a society will do it.

697
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:03,380
That's a different
choice. Or if you say, no,

698
00:47:03,381 --> 00:47:08,381
we're going to make the letter MyEd
the manufacturer internalize this.

699
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:11,920
That's a different choice.
My point he has, it's,

700
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:16,310
it's always a choice.
It's always a choice.

701
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:23,530
We'll come to read a, a libertarian
called Robert Nozick later in the course.

702
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:27,640
And one of his one line is,

703
00:47:27,641 --> 00:47:32,641
is that the question of political theory
is whether or not they should be a

704
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:34,923
state.

705
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:40,240
But we'll see that that's a bit like
saying the fundamental question of dental

706
00:47:40,241 --> 00:47:42,490
theory is whether or not
they should be teeth.

707
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:43,833
Okay?

708
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:45,480
Because in fact,

709
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:50,420
everything involves collective choices.

710
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,350
Even the collective choice to let
the loss. Why lie, where it falls,

711
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:56,300
that is itself a collective choice.

712
00:47:56,870 --> 00:48:00,860
So you can't ring the politics
out of politics and the,

713
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,490
at least one goal of the enlightenment.
We're going to see this,

714
00:48:04,491 --> 00:48:09,491
this idea of re replacing politics
with science or in this formulation of

715
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
politics being displaced by administration
can never be perfectly realized.

716
00:48:16,221 --> 00:48:20,840
And that's an important insight
we get from thinking about, uh,

717
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:25,880
trying to apply mill's harm
principle. Okay. See you on Monday.
