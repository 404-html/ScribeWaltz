1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:02,521
Okay.

2
00:00:02,521 --> 00:00:07,521
So let's pick up where we left off on
Monday and we were starting to talk in

3
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:11,280
more detail about Macintyre's argument.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,620
And um,

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:19,010
one of the things I want to reserve pro
in centrally on today is his account of

6
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:24,960
human psychology or what used
to be called human nature. Um,

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,590
and that differs importantly from every
account of human psychology we've looked

8
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:34,770
at thus far, um, for a number of reasons.

9
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:39,690
And I'm going to spell them
out in a little bit more
detail then we talked about

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,930
on Monday.
Um,

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,900
basically it is an error,

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,960
the telian conception of the structure
of human psychology and that has a number

13
00:00:51,421 --> 00:00:52,590
of features to it.

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:58,220
One is that I mentioned to you that we
think of human beings as teleological

15
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,940
creatures.
We are purpose of creatures.

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,470
We always want to know what
the point of an activity is.

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,113
Um,

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,920
now if you go back to Aristotle,

19
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,490
Aristotle held the view that
while we are purpose of creatures,

20
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,930
we only reason about the
means to achieve our goals,

21
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,070
not the goals themselves.
For Aristotle,

22
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,830
Aristotles conception of virtue,
the virtues,

23
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,420
the virtues were given for all time.
And he had his list of the virtues,

24
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:37,380
which you can find if you go back
and read the Nica McKeon ethics.

25
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:42,150
They're things like a courage,
honesty and various other,

26
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,870
uh, perhaps debatable, perhaps not.

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,490
But in any event, in, in
Aristotle scheme of things, um,

28
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,140
what we reasoned about is the
means to achieve the virtues,

29
00:01:55,141 --> 00:02:00,141
not the virtues themselves and are going
to come back to that because one of the

30
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,330
respects in which macintyre differs
from Aristotle is that he wants to say,

31
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,670
um,
the virtues.

32
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:13,210
He wants to at least go this far with the,

33
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,540
the enlightenment thinkers.

34
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,640
He wants to say that what counts
as a virtue is to some extent,

35
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,310
uh,

36
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,170
up for debate just to what extent
and how we debated are things,

37
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,930
things that I'll come back to.
But,

38
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,050
but the more important point is that this,
as,

39
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:38,460
as an account of the
structure of human psychology,

40
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,660
we need to know what the point is we have,
we have goals,

41
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:46,410
we have purposes.
When those purposes are met,

42
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,520
we're happy and fulfilled
when they're not met.

43
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,470
We're frustrated and
unsatisfied and discontented.

44
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,113
Um,

45
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,860
just to give you a somewhat
different perspective on this,

46
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,980
this approach to thinking
about human psychology.

47
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,850
I would say that the
other influential Eris,

48
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:14,851
the Tyrian about time besides Alister
Mcintyre is the Nobel prize winning

49
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:18,230
economist Amartya Sen,
um,

50
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,640
who develops the idea of
human potentiality as the
core notion that we are,

51
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,270
we are people who have potential.

52
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,750
And unless we realize our potential,

53
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,560
we're going to be in some
basic sense in complete.

54
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,530
I'm not fulfilled,

55
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,170
not happy human beings.

56
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:45,800
And so in incense account
of justice, which, uh,

57
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,450
I wish we had time to talk about
in this course. Uh, but we don't,

58
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,440
it's an analogous that he's an economist,
not a philosopher.

59
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:58,000
So he's brings the considerations
of an economist to this question.

60
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,770
But it's the same question of human beings
who have a certain kind of potential

61
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,980
that has to be realized in
order for them to be fulfilled.

62
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,943
Uh,

63
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:09,840
okay.

64
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,040
In the, in the teleological, uh, capacity,

65
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,420
it ha that has to occur. And so, um,

66
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,250
with Mcintyre too,

67
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:25,110
it's this idea of the structure of
human psychology being goal directed.

68
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,340
Um, and we'll get, we'll get
into the content later. But,

69
00:04:29,341 --> 00:04:30,930
so that's the first thing.

70
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:35,070
And then the second was that are um,

71
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,323
yeah,

72
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,020
behavior is in a very
fundamental way other directed.

73
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,880
So just again by way of a comparison,

74
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,980
think back to the

75
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:50,920
okay.

76
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Assumptions about other directedness in
previous thinkers who we have considered

77
00:04:56,531 --> 00:05:01,210
in the scores when we focused
on the utilitarian tradition,

78
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,190
um, we saw a paypal as
essentially self referential.

79
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,580
Remember Ronald Reagan's famous question
in 1984 are you better off than you

80
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:16,300
were four years ago?
Was a self referential question.

81
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,150
Are you better off than
you were four years ago?

82
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:24,151
All you have to look at is how you were
fairing four years ago and how you're

83
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:26,980
fairing now.
And Ask yourself that question.

84
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,980
Other people don't enter into it at all.

85
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,860
Then when we considered Marxism,

86
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:38,130
we came to think about other directed
conceptions of human psychology in that

87
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:43,711
Mark's made our welfare critically
reliant on what others get.

88
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,710
Um, and so, um,

89
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,040
he said that your perception of whether
you're exploited turns upon what your

90
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,490
employer gets.
I mean,

91
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,550
we talked about this in some depth and
concluded that Mark's was half right in

92
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:07,550
that people are often other
directed in that that sense of,

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,350
of what they get,

94
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:15,320
their sense of whether what they get is
legitimate is dependent on what others

95
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:15,680
get.

96
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,680
But what he was wrong about
was that people tend to
compare themselves to people

97
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:25,490
who are similarly situated
in the socioeconomic order.

98
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:30,330
So auto workers compared
themselves maybe to um,

99
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,170
uh,

100
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:36,170
steel workers but not to auto executives
and they don't make those kinds of

101
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:39,500
global comparisons.
Nonetheless,

102
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:44,710
there is something to this idea that
people's conception of their welfare is

103
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:47,840
connected to what others get.

104
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:52,841
And so relative inequalities matter simply
from the perspective of your feeling

105
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,770
of uh,
how well off you are.

106
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:02,690
And you can tell yourself any number
of stories to make this point. You the,

107
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,880
the, the telling why not quite
often I think is, you know,

108
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:12,881
you give a child a glass of orange juice
that's half full and he's very happy

109
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,390
and then you get his sister one that's
completely fall and he immediately

110
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:22,391
becomes unhappy because what matters to
him is the relative difference and not

111
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,980
what he has in his glass.

112
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,740
So that's a notion of other directed.

113
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:33,190
And of course you can take this notion
of other directed further still by

114
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:37,320
linking your utility not to just one,

115
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,190
just to what other people get,

116
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,510
but to actually what
other people experience.

117
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,180
And this is the concept of other direct,
uh,

118
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:52,540
this is the concept of
interdependent utility, uh, as it,

119
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,610
as it gets referred to in the literature.

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,460
And the examples here are things like,
uh,

121
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,650
a parent,
um,

122
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,920
taking pleasure in their child's success
and feeling pain at their child's lack

123
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,210
of success.

124
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,290
One of the famous a one
line has that parents, uh,

125
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:21,530
will resonate with is you can only be
as happy as your least happy child.

126
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,040
So if your kids are unhappy,
then you're miserable.

127
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,590
That's the notion of
interdependent utility.

128
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,700
Your happiness is conditioned on what,
on what others get.

129
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:36,910
But Not Justin in making us a relative
judgment with the orange juice,

130
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,650
Chi kind of a case.

131
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,750
But your happiness becomes
dependent on what people are,

132
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:48,620
the actually themselves experience tense,
interdependent utility.

133
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:51,860
And those are the example
of the child's happiness.

134
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:54,350
Making the parent or the child success,

135
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,770
making the parent happy is an
interdependent, positive utility.

136
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:03,771
But of course there are interdependent
negative utilities as well as when a or a

137
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,400
sadist or rapist utility goes up as a
byproduct of their victims utility going

138
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:18,730
down. Again, that's interdependent,
negative utility. And it's,

139
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,130
it's the mirror image of interdependent,
positive utility.

140
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,100
The Aristotelian conception,

141
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:31,101
that error that Macintyre embraces takes
into dependent utilities a step further

142
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:38,001
even than that though in that it's not
just that your happiness or success

143
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,010
satisfaction or fulfillment
is conditioned upon,

144
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,790
um,
the experience of others,

145
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,560
but it's the experience of
others as it relates to you.

146
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,910
It's the others' experience of you,
if you like.

147
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,300
And so a good example of this actually
comes from Hegel's phenomenology where he

148
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:06,990
talks about, um, the,

149
00:10:06,991 --> 00:10:11,991
this dialectic between the master and
the slave as being inherently unstable.

150
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:13,980
Um,

151
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,980
but it's not just unstable because the
slave is going to find it unsatisfactory.

152
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,170
Um, it's, it's,

153
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,110
it's unstable because the master
will find it unsatisfactory.

154
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,120
Hagle says in the phenomenology that
what we want most fundamentally is

155
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,850
recognition from others,

156
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:41,210
but it can't be recognition from
others that we don't respect.

157
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:44,310
So it's the recognition of a slave saying,
yes,

158
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:49,311
Monster Know Mazda is not going to be
satisfactory or fail failing to you.

159
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:54,950
What you want is recognition from
an equal or perhaps a superior,

160
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:01,130
but you want recognition from somebody
who's recognition can be valuable to you

161
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:07,260
to source of feeling valued
by somebody you value.

162
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:12,210
So it's, it takes this idea, as I
said, an interdependent utility,

163
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,280
even a step further because it,
it's now goes to the,

164
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:22,330
the reciprocal relationship
between you and the other person.

165
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,820
And that is the idea of practices.

166
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,780
That is the,
it's a sort of neo regalian idea in,

167
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:34,530
in this particular sense
that informs Makin dies.

168
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:39,450
I notion of a practice. When I gave you
the example on Monday, I said, you know,

169
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:44,370
if I build sheds and write books,
it's not any,

170
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,720
it's not enough for me to
have the carpenters say, oh,

171
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:53,070
you wrote a good book. And uh, and
the academic side, that's an I shed.

172
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,380
I want the carpenter does
say that's a good shit.

173
00:11:56,381 --> 00:12:00,400
And the people who know about writing
books to us to say this is a good book,

174
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,510
right? That's the ocean, not the
notion of he's a pitcher's pitcher.

175
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,620
You want recognition from people for home.

176
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:12,490
You have is steam at
the relevant activity.

177
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,830
So this is a different,

178
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:18,970
again view of the structure
of human psychology.

179
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:23,971
All of these different
theories are predicated on
some account of the structure

180
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:27,970
of human psychology.
And indeed,

181
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:32,971
I think that one thing you
should be seeing as we move
through and examine these

182
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:39,931
different arguments is that every
political theory has an account of human

183
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:45,850
psychology and an account of
how the world operates causally.

184
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,550
And you need to sometimes
dig to get them out. Um, but,

185
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,930
but one of the ways in which you should
evaluate them is you should ask yourself,

186
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,710
what is the theory of
human psychology driving?

187
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:01,180
This doesn't make sense.

188
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:05,860
Is it true to my own experience or not?
And if not,

189
00:13:05,861 --> 00:13:07,870
why not though?
That's one question.

190
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:12,400
And then the second is what are the
assumptions about how the world works

191
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:17,080
causally? And I'll come back to
those in relation to Mcintyre again,

192
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:22,630
but you could go through all the thinkers
we've considered and find assumptions

193
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:25,120
or arguments about those two things.

194
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:29,860
And they provide a very good comparative
reference point for thinking about how

195
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:31,810
they stack up against one another.

196
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:36,640
As we've just seen as we went from
the utilitarian to the Marxian,

197
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:41,890
uh, to the, uh, different
variants of, of other referential,

198
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,420
um, human, uh, assumptions
about human psychology.

199
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,441
So this is,

200
00:13:47,441 --> 00:13:52,441
this is the Mcintyre approach that
what we really want out of life is,

201
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:58,260
is steam from people who we esteem
and that operates through these,

202
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,950
these con, this, these
practices as he describes them.

203
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,660
And,
um,

204
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:12,280
this is just a summary Statement
of what I've already told you.

205
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:17,281
He where he says virtues as he describes
them are embedded in pro practices.

206
00:14:19,331 --> 00:14:23,770
It belongs to the concept of a practice.
As I've, as I have outlined it,

207
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,310
and as we all familiar with
it in our actual lives,

208
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,900
whether we are painters or physicists or
quarterbacks were indeed just lovers of

209
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:36,040
good painting or first rate
experiments or a wealth thrown pass,

210
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,260
that it's goods can only be achieved
by subordinating ourselves within the

211
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:45,370
practice in our relationships
to other practitioners,

212
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,780
we have to learn to recognize
what is due to whom.

213
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,950
We have to be prepared to take whatever
self endangering risks or demanded along

214
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:55,784
the way.

215
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:00,830
And we have to listen carefully to what
we are told about our own inadequacies

216
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,040
and to reply with the same
carefulness for the facts.

217
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,860
So this is the notion that I translated
into the proposition that when you walk

218
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:17,090
into your first Yell College course,
you don't say,

219
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:20,720
look around and say to the people next
to you, how should we run this courts?

220
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,100
What should we agree to? On the
contrary, what you do is say,

221
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:29,090
what is the practice? What are
the norms? What are the rules?

222
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:32,690
How do I do well here and
what's expected of me?

223
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,090
How will I know if I'm doing well?

224
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:39,290
It might occur to you much
later on to say, you know,

225
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:43,520
that Washington a very well run a course.
It could have been run better if that,

226
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:44,810
if this,
that and the other.

227
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,270
So you can criticize and Makin
I'll come back to that point later.

228
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,560
Um,

229
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,560
but you can only criticize on the basis
of first having internalized the norms

230
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,110
governing the practice,
right?

231
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:05,140
You don't criticize somebody's pitching
style in major league baseball until

232
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:11,060
you've learned a lot about
pitching or maybe you do,

233
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:15,920
you sit there and throw your beer can
at the screener or terrible, but, uh,

234
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:20,480
it's not the form of criticism he
is going to care about. Right? Uh,

235
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,470
and that's the point.

236
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:26,471
And it's not likely to be the
criticism that makes any difference.

237
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,910
So rather than the,

238
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,500
the voluntary agent being
at the center of things,

239
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:35,990
which is the,
the workmanship story,

240
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,010
this anti enlightenment
[inaudible] enlightenment story,

241
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:45,020
subordinates the
individual to the practice,

242
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:49,400
to the group, to the inherited
system of norms and values.

243
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:52,940
And if you want a contemporary
reference point, just,

244
00:16:52,941 --> 00:16:57,941
just again to sharpen the comparison
here compared the car Tz idea,

245
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:04,601
which puts the willing agent at the
center of the universe with the um,

246
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,860
[inaudible],
which is a kind of African religion,

247
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:15,200
which does the contrarian thing
instead of I think therefore I am,

248
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:15,650
it's,

249
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,510
I am because we are and
since we are therefore I am.

250
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,900
So it's this idea of
subordinating yourself two and
a half and inherited system

251
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:31,181
of norms of prion and practices
in which you find yourself not,

252
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:35,510
which you created in he will
hypothetically might have created,

253
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,770
but where the in which you find
yourself. So this is, this is,

254
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,630
this is a fundamental difference.

255
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,290
It doesn't get more
fundamental than this I think.

256
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:53,291
Because as you've seen in every variant
of enlightenment thinking it's the will,

257
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,600
the willing creative agent that is
that the ultimate bottom of the heap.

258
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:06,120
And here it's not. It's the
subordinated individual, uh,

259
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:11,150
and the community to which the community
or the practice or the tradition to

260
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,520
which the person is subordinated.

261
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:18,510
That is at the very bottom of the heap.
So these are,

262
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,800
this is really a fundamental difference.

263
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:24,661
Okay,

264
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:29,661
so features of Eris alien or we might
call it [inaudible] alien psychology.

265
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,400
One is we are teleological in
the sense of being purposive.

266
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,940
We have potential to realize and realizing
that potential is essential to our

267
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:46,650
happiness. It's not just getting
more of what gives you utility.

268
00:18:46,651 --> 00:18:51,210
There's some developmental
dimension to this. Second,

269
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,403
the

270
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:53,720
okay,

271
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,720
the individual is subordinated
to a practice and that
translates into this idea

272
00:19:00,301 --> 00:19:05,010
of the community becoming before
the individual in politics.

273
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:11,420
But third and in some ways for Mcintyre
story most important of all is that on

274
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:16,650
the Aristotelian scheme,

275
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,070
human nature is malleable,

276
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:26,010
it's plastic,
it can be shaped in different ways.

277
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:32,810
And what is so deeply misguided about
the enlightenment project from Mac and

278
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:40,530
pious point of view is that it
does not take account of this fact.

279
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:46,110
It does not take account of the fact that
human beings are malleable creatures.

280
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:51,111
Human psychology is shaped
by circumstances and

281
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:55,890
okay,

282
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:00,090
so when Russo says at the
start of the social contract,

283
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:03,240
I'm in a reason about
politics taking manners,

284
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:05,670
they are and laws as they might be.

285
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:11,420
That underscores the fact that we're so
is missing the developmental features of

286
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:19,320
human psychology in
reasoning about politics.

287
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,870
And it's in missing that,

288
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,710
that the enlightenment
project went off the rails.

289
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,650
So let's talk about Aristotle's
scheme and then I let,

290
00:20:30,651 --> 00:20:31,760
let me just read this too,

291
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:35,580
and then I will explain it
if you haven't understood it.

292
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,550
He says it in his description.

293
00:20:38,551 --> 00:20:42,630
We have a threefold scheme
in which human nature,

294
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:47,690
as it happens to be human nature
in its untutored or raw state,

295
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,760
is initially discrepant and discordant
with the precepts of ethics and needs to

296
00:20:56,051 --> 00:21:01,051
be transformed by the instruction of
practical reason and experience into human

297
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:05,900
nature as it could be if it real the eyes.

298
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,300
It's tell us each of the
three elements of the scheme,

299
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,390
the conception of untutored human nature,

300
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:18,660
the conception of the precepts
of irrational ethics and
the conception of human

301
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:23,791
nature as it could be if it realizes it's
t loss requires reference to the other

302
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:29,581
two if its status and
function or to be in town.

303
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,523
Digable.

304
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,840
So his point here is if you
go back and read Aristotle,

305
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,990
he had a view of raw or
untutored or brute human nature,

306
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:47,600
how we are
when we are born.

307
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:54,750
Then he had an account of human beings
as they could be if they realize they're

308
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,760
tell us their purposes.

309
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:04,510
And then he had an account of the rules
that get you from the one to the other,

310
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,890
the rules, the norms that get
you from the one to the other.

311
00:22:08,891 --> 00:22:10,870
And those are the rules of ethics.

312
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,950
So what are the rules of ethics?

313
00:22:14,951 --> 00:22:19,360
The rules of ethics are those things
that get you from untutored or raw human

314
00:22:19,361 --> 00:22:20,830
nature too.

315
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,130
The kinds of beings who realized
that tell us or purposes.

316
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:31,420
And that's why if you look at ancient
philosophers like Aristotle or Plato,

317
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,850
the two central features
of their political theory
that are completely absent.

318
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,690
When you read,
say John Rawls,

319
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:44,590
a theory of family life
and a theory of education,

320
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:50,190
it would have been bizarre
beyond imagining for Aristotle
or Plato to think you

321
00:22:54,401 --> 00:22:59,401
could have a theory of politics that
didn't put a huge amount of intention to

322
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:02,110
those two things.

323
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:05,530
Think of how many people in this
room have read Plato's Republic,

324
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,690
at least a good number of you think,
how much of that's a book about politics.

325
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:15,190
Think how much of that is about how
to rear children and the system of

326
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:20,080
education, uh, that has to prevail,
right? Enormous amount of it.

327
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,340
Probably half the book.

328
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:27,640
It's nothing of that enrolls
his theory of justice, right?

329
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,160
On males account in on liberty.

330
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:35,800
So it's a big difference.
And the reason is,

331
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:39,970
and the same is true of Aristotle's
ethics and these other writings about

332
00:23:39,971 --> 00:23:44,440
politics. Lots of attention
to education, to the family,

333
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,810
um,
to these things that are,

334
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:51,830
that involves shaping
this malleable plastic,

335
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:56,831
human nature so that we have a good
outcome rather than a bad outcome.

336
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,003
Right?

337
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:04,650
And so what,
what bugs Macintyre,

338
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:09,900
is he saying we want to
derive the rules of ethics

339
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,080
from human nature as it is,
as we find it.

340
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:24,470
But that's never gonna work because
the rules of ethics I design to improve

341
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,380
behavior,
not to simply aggregate

342
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,493
behavior.

343
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,540
And so anything we design,

344
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,700
anything we design that's just derived
from people as they happen to be.

345
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:47,360
It's gonna. It's gonna seem unsatisfying,
satisfying to us and satisfactory to us.

346
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:52,820
So you know, to go back to
the examples we discussed, um,

347
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,680
affirmative action, the ones he mentioned
at the beginning of the book, abortion,

348
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:59,540
affirmative action and so on.
Yes,

349
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:03,530
we're going to see people have different
values and therefore different.

350
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:04,930
Yeah,

351
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:07,060
uh,
views about those questions,

352
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,090
but they're not going to be,

353
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:14,740
they're not going to ultimately be
satisfied with just recognizing their

354
00:25:14,741 --> 00:25:19,741
differences because they have inherited
a whole language of talking about ethics

355
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,500
that presumes these things
can be resolved. That there,

356
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,120
that there is it,

357
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:33,150
there is more to ethical disagreement
then just accepting the differences among

358
00:25:34,421 --> 00:25:39,421
us and that at the end of the
day is why the enlightenment

359
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,590
project was a fool's errand.

360
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:50,310
Since this is just mere Mcintyre's more
eloquent and lucid statement of what

361
00:25:51,461 --> 00:25:55,000
I've been saying to you for the last five
minutes, minutes that I'm capable of.

362
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,360
He says since the moral injunctions were
originally at home in a scheme in which

363
00:26:00,731 --> 00:26:02,440
their purpose was to correct,

364
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,040
improve and educate human nature,

365
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:11,430
they are clearly not going to be such
as could be deduced from true statements

366
00:26:11,681 --> 00:26:15,010
about human nature. Just
think of Bentham, he says,

367
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:19,270
we are driven by pleasure
seeking and pain avoiding.

368
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:25,050
I'm going to derive a whole system from
that right mackintosh saying that's

369
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:30,510
crazy because these moral injunctions
were designed to be at odds with human

370
00:26:32,771 --> 00:26:36,930
nature. The injunctions of
morality that's understood,

371
00:26:36,931 --> 00:26:41,530
they're likely to be the ones that
human nature has strong tendencies to

372
00:26:41,531 --> 00:26:42,400
disobey.

373
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:48,050
Hence the 18th century moral philosophers
engaged in what was inevitably an

374
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:51,150
unsuccessful project for.

375
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:55,920
They did indeed attempt to find a rational
basis for their moral beliefs in a

376
00:26:55,921 --> 00:27:00,720
particular understanding of human
nature while inheriting a set of moral

377
00:27:00,721 --> 00:27:05,640
injunctions on the one hand
and a conception of human
nature. On the other hand,

378
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:10,320
which had been expressly designed
to be discrepant with each other.

379
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:16,100
They inherited incoherent fragments of
a once coherence scheme of thought and

380
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:19,170
action.

381
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:24,170
And since they did not recognize their
own peculiar historical and cultural

382
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:25,530
situation,

383
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:30,860
they could not recognize the impossible
and quixotic character of their self

384
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:34,380
appointed task.

385
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,450
Whether it's Ben,

386
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:44,030
I'm trying to derive maxims
of conduct from the posture,

387
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:49,050
them pleasure seeking pain
avoidance or Rousseau trying to,

388
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:51,923
um,

389
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,780
come up with a system of government
taking manners. They are,

390
00:27:57,781 --> 00:28:00,480
and they laws his name might be or can't,

391
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:05,130
trying to see what principles
human beings as they currently are,

392
00:28:05,131 --> 00:28:10,131
would affirm from every conceivable
standpoint it's Naveh gonna work.

393
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:16,910
The morality that comes out of this
kind of reasoning is going to same.

394
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,050
And actually we'll be unsatisfying to us.

395
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,060
And so we,
if you,

396
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:29,330
if you now go back and look at some of
the puzzles and conundrums we came up

397
00:28:30,601 --> 00:28:35,340
with when we were considering those
different theories, Macintyre would say,

398
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:39,540
well, you shouldn't be surprised.
You shouldn't be surprised.

399
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:44,580
Um,
that object of utilitarianism puts,

400
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,853
uh,

401
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:52,950
allows people to take advantage
of one another in appalling ways.

402
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,990
And you shouldn't be surprised that
subject of utilitarianism allows people to

403
00:28:57,991 --> 00:29:02,800
ignore one another in a Po
Marley appalling ways, um,

404
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:07,610
because what makes things seem
morally appalling to you? Um,

405
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:11,670
treat people with dignity. Um,
don't lie, cheat and steal.

406
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,160
These are maxims that,
um,

407
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,500
we know people have a tendency to disobey,

408
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:24,900
right? And so that's the point of them,

409
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:30,100
that to make us behave better and you're
not going to be able to derive them in

410
00:29:30,331 --> 00:29:32,400
this sense from

411
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:41,570
a completely empirically
accurate description of human
beings as we find them in

412
00:29:42,311 --> 00:29:46,690
the wall. So it's a, it's a kind of
secular doctrine of the fall, right?

413
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:51,430
And in Christian, in
Christian thinking, you know,

414
00:29:51,431 --> 00:29:56,431
we have the fall and then
we have inadequate human
beings and the possibility of

415
00:29:58,061 --> 00:29:58,781
redemption,

416
00:29:58,781 --> 00:30:03,520
the possibility of redemption
through internalizing and accepting,

417
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,460
um, Christ as your savior. The Sec,

418
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,390
this is a secular version
of the fall that we have.

419
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:14,040
MMM
MMM.

420
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:19,250
Fallen the secular version of fallen
man untutored ill formed human nature.

421
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,320
And then we have what, what we could
be if we, we are properly formed.

422
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:31,340
And then the system of the rules of ethics
that are going to get us from the one

423
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,290
to the other.
And it's,

424
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:38,970
it's the virtues in within practices that,
uh,

425
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:44,030
achieving them w achieving lives lived
in accordance with them that enable us

426
00:30:44,971 --> 00:30:46,730
to,
um,

427
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:51,450
realize our purposes in a good way.

428
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,080
And it's,

429
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,080
it's there the rules and norms governing
those practices that get us from a to

430
00:30:57,631 --> 00:30:58,464
B.

431
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,543
And

432
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:06,510
the big problem with the enlightenment
philosophically is what I've just said to

433
00:31:06,511 --> 00:31:06,990
you,

434
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:11,880
that they try and engage
in this quixotic task,

435
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,280
but in politics itself,

436
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,250
okay,

437
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:20,870
it's the creation of an emotive as world.
It's a creation of a world

438
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:27,150
that's separates, means from ends that
values the instrumental reasoning,

439
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:31,590
the world. You know, the business
school world written large,

440
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,281
the,

441
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:37,281
the world in which we make ourselves
agnostic about people's purposes and just

442
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,600
try to set ourselves up as the most
efficient executer of any purpose have

443
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:48,240
skills. Well travel, right?

444
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:53,010
I'm a consultant for what?
Well, whatever you need,

445
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,203
right?
That's,

446
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,040
that's what he finds politically
shocking and appalling,

447
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:03,870
but he thinks it's underpinned by
this whole philosophical scheme.

448
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:09,960
Now, Mcintyre wrote this during
the, this book came out in 1984,

449
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:13,220
which was at the height of the Cold War.
You know,

450
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:17,570
one of the points he was making
was everybody thinks the,

451
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,413
the,

452
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,330
the great battle of our time is the
confrontation between capitalism and

453
00:32:24,331 --> 00:32:28,470
communism.
But for Macintyre,

454
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:34,080
you know, these are two sides of the
same coin because there they are both.

455
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:37,960
They are both

456
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,600
ways in which this enlightenment project
has been played out and politics and

457
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,680
they're both for him.
Appalling.

458
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,690
So when we,
you know,

459
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,610
I started out saying to Mcintyre,

460
00:32:56,570 --> 00:33:01,520
thought of himself as a
person on the political left,
at least when he was young,

461
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,230
when he wrote Marxism and Christianity
and against the self images of the age

462
00:33:06,231 --> 00:33:10,820
and those holy books.
But it's in a different sense.

463
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:12,620
It's not like, you know, uh,

464
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:18,850
Robert Bork said at one point in
his confirmation hearings, you,

465
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,640
you're already too young to
remember this, but he, uh,

466
00:33:22,641 --> 00:33:26,270
they questioned him about his
changing ideological beliefs.

467
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:28,550
And at one point he said,
well,

468
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:32,900
I've always thought if you're not
a socialist before the age of 30,

469
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:36,590
you have no heart. And if you are
a socialist after the age of 30,

470
00:33:36,591 --> 00:33:41,150
you have no head. Um, this
isn't macintyre, right.

471
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,230
He wants to say the whole
enlightenment venture,

472
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:51,100
whether it's in its capitalist or it's
socialist form is a variant of this.

473
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:52,963
Um,

474
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,913
yeah,

475
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:58,270
deeply muddled,
hopeless quest,

476
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,233
mmm.

477
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:05,490
To develop a science of politics
based on a human nature as we find it.

478
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:13,060
And so his prescriptions are
rather different. He says,

479
00:34:13,061 --> 00:34:18,061
what matters at this stage
is the construction of local
forms of community with

480
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:22,570
within which civility and intellectual
and moral life can be sustained through

481
00:34:22,571 --> 00:34:25,960
the new dark ages which
are already upon us.

482
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,560
He's not a utopian,
he's a dystopian almost.

483
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:34,280
And if the tradition of the virtues was
able to survive the horrors of the loss

484
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:39,250
dark ages, we're not entirely
without grounds for hope this time.

485
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:42,850
However, the barbarians are not
waiting beyond the frontiers.

486
00:34:42,851 --> 00:34:45,850
They've already been governing
and us for quite some time.

487
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:50,650
And it is our lack of consciousness
of deaths that constitutes part of our

488
00:34:50,651 --> 00:34:54,220
predicament. We're not, we
are waiting not for Godot,

489
00:34:54,221 --> 00:34:58,510
but for another doubtless
very different saint benedict.

490
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,063
Now

491
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:06,570
people criticized McEntire
for a variety of things.

492
00:35:07,511 --> 00:35:11,350
But one of the things they criticized
him for was this seems to be sort of

493
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:15,610
throwing up your hands,
uh, and saying, you know,

494
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,980
the whole world is terrible.

495
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:22,120
We're about to enter the new dark ages
and there's not much we can do about it

496
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:24,160
except hunkered down and hope.

497
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,813
MMM.

498
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:31,630
And he wrote several books that probably
the most important of which is a book

499
00:35:32,871 --> 00:35:34,340
called whose justice,

500
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:39,210
which rationality in an attempt
to respond to these criticisms.

501
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:43,260
But actually on the, on the on,
I'll talk about some of that in,

502
00:35:43,261 --> 00:35:48,060
in a minute on the actual
politics that flow from this.

503
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:53,370
He never had anything more to
say than this. So it's really,

504
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:57,930
it is,
it is a diagnosis without a cure.

505
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,820
And if you, you know, I said this was
written at the height of the Cold War.

506
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,670
If you look at the post
Cold War and you say,

507
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,470
what would macintyre say today?
Um,

508
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,900
it's not at all clear because he certainly
would not be a fan of militant Islam,

509
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,850
but it's not clear what he
would, you know, he would,

510
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:30,851
he would probably find the
spread of globalization as
just one more step in this

511
00:36:33,051 --> 00:36:33,884
appalling,

512
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:38,750
a triumph of instrumental
reasoning and values.

513
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:43,990
So, uh, I think he would, he
would, uh, he would be Joe,

514
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:48,350
no less despondent. Um, and I think he's,

515
00:36:48,351 --> 00:36:51,170
he's diagnosis,
this is pure speculation.

516
00:36:51,171 --> 00:36:52,880
I haven't had this conversation with them,

517
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:58,180
but my guess is that his diagnosis of
militant Islam and jihadism and all of

518
00:36:58,251 --> 00:37:02,350
that would be, he would just say, well,
it's, it's an inevitable undertow.

519
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:07,390
It's an inevitable reaction by the
losers from globalization against,

520
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,450
uh, against the, the,

521
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:16,530
the endless spread, um, of, um,

522
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,810
enlightenment ideas.
Uh,

523
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:25,050
I think in some ways that could be a more
interesting makin and Tyrion analysis

524
00:37:26,501 --> 00:37:30,310
of China in that, in China, you know,

525
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:35,610
we see now the fusion of comment as
politics and capitalist economics,

526
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:41,020
neither of which I was any signs
of going anywhere. And so the, the,

527
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,710
you know, when in 1984
somebody had said, well,

528
00:37:44,711 --> 00:37:48,670
capitalism and communism are
two sides of the same coin.

529
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:53,910
People would have been quite dismissive
when you think about China today.

530
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,130
Um, you know, it's, it's
quite thought provoking.

531
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:05,420
Okay.
So that's Macintyre in a nutshell.

532
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,283
Okay.

533
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:14,430
Lots of, it's quite appealing. You
know, this account of human beings,

534
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,870
how many people that, never mind the on
realism of the pilot. How many find the,

535
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:23,310
this account of human nature plausible,
true to your own experience.

536
00:38:23,311 --> 00:38:27,930
At least some, not that
money. We do, you know,

537
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:30,090
we want, we're, we're,

538
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,070
we're sort of lots of unrequited love,
right? We, we want to be liked. We want,

539
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:39,940
we want to be wanted and we want to be
wanted by cool people or people we think

540
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:41,110
are cool.
All right?

541
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:47,130
So that whole side of it seems right
and the notion that political morality

542
00:38:51,221 --> 00:38:55,810
should somehow be an
improving thing seems right.

543
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:00,700
That it can't, you can't
just derive it from the, um,

544
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,290
as Russo said it,

545
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:06,910
if you take all of our
individual preferences and
add them up and get rid of the

546
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:10,870
pluses and minuses that
cancel one another out, uh,

547
00:39:10,871 --> 00:39:14,080
that's maybe the general,
well, but you know,

548
00:39:14,081 --> 00:39:18,850
Macintyre would say it's going to be
the lowest common denominator, right?

549
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:24,050
It's going to cater to our base instincts
and we are malleable shapeable a

550
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:30,510
improvable creatures and we're not
happy unless that actually happening.

551
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,630
So all of that seems right.
But on the other hand,

552
00:39:34,631 --> 00:39:36,070
as I mentioned to you,

553
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:37,630
yeah,

554
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:41,120
Mcintyre makes one huge concession.

555
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,173
Okay.

556
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,600
To the way of thinking that at
least motivated the enlightenment,

557
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:53,200
which was that Aristotle was wrong
to say we don't reason about ends now

558
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,190
Aristotle took ends is given and said,

559
00:40:00,191 --> 00:40:01,930
we only reason about means.

560
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,960
So the big pile,

561
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,770
the big challenge for Mac and
tie is to say, well, how do you,

562
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,440
how do you say,
okay,

563
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:20,730
and this can be put in
question as subject for debate,

564
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,590
but not then wind up with emotive ism.

565
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:31,650
How do you, how do you
structure, how do you put limits?

566
00:40:31,651 --> 00:40:36,420
If you like on debates about ends,
which recognizes that people do in fact,

567
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,900
you know,
a difference between human beings and uh,

568
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,890
and dogs let's say,
or lions,

569
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:48,510
is that dogs in lions can't think
critically about their own ends.

570
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,920
They just think instrumentally about
how their ends. So really are given,

571
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:57,900
you know, dog wants to sit on a warm
couch, Elian wants to kill a buck.

572
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,400
And there's not no question
about that for a dog or alliance,

573
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:07,170
how you get on a warm couch without
being kicked off at by some nasty human,

574
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:11,850
uh, that's a question for a dog, but
not whether you want to be on right.

575
00:41:11,851 --> 00:41:13,530
Human beings aren't like that.

576
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:18,800
Human beings are capable of thinking
critically about purposes and goals.

577
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:23,580
So we have the, we, you know,

578
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:28,581
what Macintyre wants to say is we have
the structure of an Aristotelian psyche,

579
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:34,400
but not the content we do.
We are not men. And, uh,

580
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:39,290
lions in, in that sense, we can
critically appraise how goals,

581
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:42,710
but then we can argue about them and then
we can disagree about them and we can

582
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:47,660
even have civil wars about them. Uh,
when it really gets down to it. Right?

583
00:41:47,661 --> 00:41:51,410
So what do you do with the fact
that we reasoned about goals?

584
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,543
Okay.

585
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:57,690
That's why introduces the concept of
a practice. He says, well, it's true.

586
00:41:57,691 --> 00:42:01,830
We reasoned about goals,
but we don't pluck them from nowhere.

587
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:03,680
Okay.

588
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,300
We're born into practices where the
goals are defined, where, you know,

589
00:42:08,301 --> 00:42:12,800
the goal of chess is to get the person
checkmate with as many of their pieces on

590
00:42:12,801 --> 00:42:16,490
the board as possible.
You don't say,

591
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,510
let's invent a board game. You say,
what are the goals of chess? Okay.

592
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,390
And so,

593
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,460
okay,

594
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,890
they're given by practices or communities.

595
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,970
And if we think about what is a
practice or a community over time,

596
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,820
it's a tradition,
right?

597
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:38,830
And so what he wants to say is

598
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:45,190
we are born into practices and communities
and we reproduce them into the future,

599
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,230
uh,
simply by living in them.

600
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:53,400
We inherit,
we live and we reproduce into the future.

601
00:42:53,401 --> 00:42:58,401
So it's a little reminiscent or perhaps
even more than a little reminiscent of

602
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:03,600
Berks line about, yes, we are
a part of a social contract,

603
00:43:03,601 --> 00:43:06,750
but it's a contract
among those who are dead.

604
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:10,050
Those who are living in those
who are yet to be born. Right.

605
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:15,140
And so yes, we do question, you know,

606
00:43:15,141 --> 00:43:18,320
you might play chess for
law on and say, well, is it,

607
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:23,090
should it really be the goal of chess
to beat the person with as many of their

608
00:43:23,091 --> 00:43:25,280
pieces on the board as possible?

609
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:30,140
Why maybe you may be getting,

610
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:33,600
getting their pieces on the way they are,

611
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,650
the subordinate subordinated pieces
on the way to before the check made.

612
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:41,270
It should be a goal of chess, you know,
and you could have a debate, is it,

613
00:43:41,271 --> 00:43:46,271
does it take more skill to knock off
the knights and the bishops and so on in

614
00:43:46,281 --> 00:43:48,080
order and then get the checkmate?

615
00:43:48,081 --> 00:43:52,280
Or does it take more scale to get the
Person Checkmate with their knights and

616
00:43:52,281 --> 00:43:56,660
Bishops on the board? And that could be
a debate you could have, but it's a very,

617
00:43:56,661 --> 00:44:00,440
it's a contained debate. It's
a structured debate, right?

618
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:05,000
And he wants to say, our debates
about ends are always like that,

619
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:12,650
you know, think about debates
getting closer to home for Mcintyre.

620
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:17,540
I think about debates within
the Catholic church, you know,

621
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:22,130
the next generation of Catholics
doesn't say, should we have a church?

622
00:44:22,131 --> 00:44:26,030
Should it be organized? Should the
bishop of Rome have a special status?

623
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:29,540
Should there be a papal infallibility?
No.

624
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:33,490
You're born into a structure
that's already there. And
then maybe you say, Whoa,

625
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:37,620
Whoa,
why is there papal infallibility?

626
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,300
It only, it's only relatively recent
creation. Does it make, you know?

627
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:47,510
So your questioning of vans is always
from the vantage point of somebody who's

628
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,110
born into an inherited tradition.

629
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,730
And it doesn't make sense to criticize
it from the perspective about a space.

630
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:01,080
It doesn't make sense to any of the
participants and it won't ultimately give

631
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:04,950
you any answers that will
be of any in any sense,

632
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,980
meaningful to you.
Right.

633
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:14,100
And so he sees traditions as the,

634
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:15,980
as the,
um,

635
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,710
okay.

636
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:22,240
Mechanisms through which practices
are reproduced over time. And He,

637
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:26,860
and he wants to say, yes, there is
argument about ends. We then traditions.

638
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:32,250
But it's always this kind of structured
argument that is shaped by the way in

639
00:45:32,321 --> 00:45:34,930
which questions come up within traditions.

640
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:38,950
He says somewhere of course. Um, part of,

641
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:44,610
part of what it means to be a Jew is to
argue about what it means to be a Jew.

642
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:48,700
That within the Jewish tradition that
that is one of the things that people

643
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:51,550
argue about and disagree about.

644
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:56,790
But it's always going to be this bounded
structured disagreement that brings to

645
00:45:58,031 --> 00:46:02,050
bear other,
other ideas within the tradition,

646
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:07,360
within the tradition on some
particular traditional plain,

647
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,800
if you, if for those of you who
are like philosophical jargon,

648
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:14,550
Michael Walzer wrote a book,
uh,

649
00:46:14,551 --> 00:46:18,760
along comparable lines where he
talked about the idea that the,

650
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:22,990
the only effective criticism
is imminent criticism,

651
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:28,800
which is a bit like imminent for walls
is a bit like internal for Mcintyre.

652
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,030
If you want,

653
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:35,350
if you want to influence Catholics
to change their behavior,

654
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:41,800
you're not going to influence
them unless you appeal to values.

655
00:46:41,801 --> 00:46:43,450
They embrace to norms,

656
00:46:43,451 --> 00:46:48,451
they embrace to elements of the tradition
they accept and showed them how they,

657
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:50,283
um,

658
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:56,050
are undermined by the particular
thing that you are criticizing. So,

659
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,600
internal criticism,
imminent criticism,

660
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:03,710
not ex Cathedra criticism made,
uh,

661
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:08,440
from outside a whole system of norms
and values, practices, institutions.

662
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,290
Uh, you might think you're
right, but you'll know it'll,

663
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:13,180
it'll never have an effect.

664
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:15,613
Okay.

665
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,630
On the people you're trying to influence.

666
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:24,570
So is very much in that spirit.
We can argue and reason about ends,

667
00:47:24,571 --> 00:47:29,571
but only from inside
traditions and practices.

668
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,930
Um, okay, we're out of time and we,

669
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:38,790
I will finish up with this and then
start talking about democracy on Monday.
