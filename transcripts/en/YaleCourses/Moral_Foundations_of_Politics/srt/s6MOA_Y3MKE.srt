1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:06,250
This course presumes no prior
knowledge of its Sabic Jack Matter.

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,660
That is to say,

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,080
you can take this course without having
done any political philosophy before.

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:18,040
The materials we're going to look at
in this course can be approached that a

5
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,960
number of levels of sophistication,

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,710
a indeed you could teach
an entire course on,

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,520
on just John Stewart mill or John Roles.

8
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:30,790
We'll call marks what Jeremy Bentham.
Um,

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,770
and that this means that some of you who
may have had or some prior acquaintance

10
00:00:35,771 --> 00:00:40,450
with some of these tax will be able to
explore them in a different way from

11
00:00:40,451 --> 00:00:44,410
newcomers. But the course
is designed, uh, as I said,

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,520
to be user friendly to people who
are doing this for the first time.

13
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,990
There are a few parts of the course
in which I make use of technical,

14
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,850
uh, notations or
diagrams. Now, it is true,

15
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:05,851
it's just a fact about human beings
that if you put a graph or a chart or a,

16
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,640
a curve up on a diagram,

17
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,570
there's certain paypal,
some subset of the population.

18
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,430
They get a knot in their stomach.

19
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,390
They start to feel nauseas and
their brain stops functioning.

20
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,610
I can totally relate to it because I'm
actually one of those people by this

21
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:29,580
position.
Uh,

22
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:34,360
and what I can tell you about our use
of charts and diagrams and notations in

23
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:39,361
this course is this simply shorthand
for people who find it useful.

24
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,230
But I will do nothing with,
um,

25
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,980
diagrams and charts that
I don't also do verbally.

26
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,840
So if you don't get it the one way
you'll be able to get it the other way.

27
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:53,771
Um,

28
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:57,550
there are plenty of seats down here and
they're also seats upstairs if you want.

29
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,870
Um, so you should never feel
intimidated, you know, as a,

30
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,450
as I said, for people who
find graphs and charts useful,

31
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:12,250
they're a form of shorthand. But obviously
if they intimidate somebody and they,

32
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,750
they make what's being said opaque,

33
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,880
then they're being south defeating a.
And as I said,

34
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:23,881
I will always walk verbally through
anything that I also do with charts and

35
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:29,620
diagrams. Secondly, related to that point,

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,233
um,

37
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,590
it's my commitment to you that this
is a course that's done from first

38
00:02:35,591 --> 00:02:38,500
principles and everything's
explained from the ground up.

39
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,040
I might forget that contract some time
and use a term that you don't understand.

40
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,570
I might use a word like day ontological.

41
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,190
Okay.

42
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,490
And you'll sit down, you'll be
thinking, what does that mean?

43
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,780
And the high probabilities is
that if you don't know what it,

44
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,790
they're probably 70 other people in the
room who don't know what it means either.

45
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,420
And so if you put up your
hand and ask what it means

46
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,330
every you'll be doing that
was 69 people a favor, um,

47
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,620
because they wanted to know what it
means as well. So we shouldn't have any,

48
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,800
any situation in this course in which I'm
using some term that you don't and you

49
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:27,220
can't follow what I'm talking
about because you don't
understand what it means.

50
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,383
Um,

51
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,630
it is a rather embarrassing fact about
political philosophers that they don't

52
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:38,500
say in words of one syllable what can
be setting where words a five syllables.

53
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,230
But part of my job here is to reduce
them to words of one syllable, uh,

54
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:46,420
that is, um, to,

55
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,480
to take complex theoretical ideas and
make them loose it an intelligible to you.

56
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:56,960
And I say that as,
as a big part of what we're doing here.

57
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,280
So that your takeaway from this score,
it's three months ago,

58
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,920
three months from now.
Um,

59
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,970
we'll include feeling very comfortable
with the language of political philosophy

60
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:14,050
and the central, uh, terminology
in which it's conducted. So,

61
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,153
um,

62
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,380
hold my feet to the fire
on that if you need to,

63
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,670
if I use words you don't understand,
put up your hand and stop me.

64
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,460
I will from time to time throw out
questions and we'll have a microphone,

65
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,140
uh, that we can pass around so that, uh,

66
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,090
people can answer the questions. It's
one of the ways in which I gage, um,

67
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,600
how, how well the communication
between us is going.

68
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,810
Um,
so you should expect that

69
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,580
any other housekeeping matters before
I get into the substance of the course.

70
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,203
Good.

71
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,060
So this is a course about the
moral foundations of politics,

72
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,960
that moral foundations of
political argument and the
way in which we organize it

73
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:21,350
is to explore a number of
traditions of political theorizing.

74
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,690
And these are broadly grouped into

75
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:34,170
a bigger distinction that I make between
enlightenment and anti enlightenment

76
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,553
thinking.

77
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,300
That is to say we're going to start
off by looking at the enlightenment.

78
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,820
Now you might say, well,
what is the enlightenment?

79
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,770
How do you know when you trip over it?

80
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,900
And that is a subject I'm
going to get to uh, next,

81
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,410
uh, on Wednesday and Friday
because Friday, as you all know,

82
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:56,830
is going to be Mondays pluses
because of Martin Luther King.

83
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,933
Um,

84
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:04,270
but for right now I'll say
just dogmatically and I'll
elaborate for you later

85
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,840
that the enlightenment
revolved around two ideas.

86
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,890
The first is the idea of basing,

87
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,680
oh,
there is a politics on science,

88
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,810
not on religion, not on
tradition, not on superstition,

89
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,750
not on natural law,
but on science.

90
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,990
The enlightenment was born of an enormous
optimism about the possibilities of

91
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:34,724
science.

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And in this course we
will look at enlightenment
theories that puts science at

93
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:44,030
the core of political argument.

94
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,290
The second main enlightenment idea is
the idea that individual freedom is the

95
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:56,270
most important political guard.
And so if you,

96
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,680
if you wanted to get the bumper
sticker version of the enlightenment,

97
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,640
a account of politics in it is how do
you scientifically design a society to

98
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:10,340
maximize individual freedom?

99
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,230
Now we're well within that,

100
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,290
we will look at three
enlightenment traditions.

101
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,140
We'll look at the utilitarian tradition,

102
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,370
the Marxist tradition and the
social contract tradition.

103
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,910
And, uh, again,

104
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:33,320
I'll just give you the one line version
now and then we're going to come back to

105
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,980
all of these, of course, in
much greater detail later.

106
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:42,310
The utilitarian tradition says that the
way in which you create a scientifically

107
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:48,491
organize society is you maximize the
greatest happiness of the greatest number.

108
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,590
This is the, the, uh,
slogan of utilitarianism.

109
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,100
Maximize the greatest happiness
of the greatest number.

110
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:03,350
You will find that huge disagreements
among utilitarians about how you measure

111
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:08,510
your happiness and how you maximize it
and how you know when you've maximized it

112
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,583
and so on.

113
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,710
But the utilitarians all agree that that's
the goal and that if you can do that,

114
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:20,290
you will do more to maximize
human freedom than anything else.

115
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,350
The Marxist tradition has a very
different theory of science.

116
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,090
What Marx called the science
of historical materialism.

117
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,360
But it too was based on this idea
that we can have impersonal scientific

118
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:44,511
principles that give us the right
answer for the Organization of society.

119
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,990
One of Mark's is famous wine liners.
Why's that?

120
00:08:48,991 --> 00:08:53,850
We will eventually get to a world
in which politics is replaced by

121
00:08:53,851 --> 00:08:54,750
administration,

122
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,400
implying that all forms of
moral disagreement we'll
have gone away because we

123
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:05,490
will have gotten the
technically the right answers.

124
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:10,970
And now the formulation of that same
idea actually comes from a different

125
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:15,780
enlightenment thinker who are
not going to read in this course,

126
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,020
David Hume who said if,
if all moral,

127
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:24,340
if all moral disagreements
were resolved, no, no,

128
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,750
uh,
political disagreements would remain.

129
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,380
So that's the idea of a scientific,

130
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,900
a solution to um,

131
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,990
what appear to be the moral
dilemmas that divide us.

132
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,390
So for marks, we'll see a very different
theory of science, but for him to,

133
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,060
he thinks that freedom is the most
important. Good. That might surprise you.

134
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:54,000
Most people think, well, march was
about equality. He was egalitarian.

135
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,140
You'll see that that's only true in a,

136
00:09:58,141 --> 00:10:03,141
in a somewhat the rivet of sense because
in the end what it was important for

137
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,860
Marx was that people are equally free,
um,

138
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,630
that they are in a situation
of not being exploited. Uh,

139
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,780
and he too,
therefore it's an enlightenment thinker.

140
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:21,890
Then the social contract tradition says
that the way we get some scientific

141
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,860
theory of society is to think about
what agreement people would make if they

142
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,920
were designing society for the first time.

143
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:36,120
If society was going to be based on
a contract, what would it look like?

144
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:41,190
And this is what gives us
the right hands, uh, uh,

145
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:46,191
as to what is rational scientific
principles tell us how we should organize

146
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:49,110
society.
And it's a society,

147
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,550
a world in which people's freedom is
preserved because it's what they choose to

148
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:55,410
do.
Again,

149
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,620
as in these other
enlightened many traditions,

150
00:10:58,621 --> 00:11:03,450
there's massive disagreement about who
makes the contract, how they make it,

151
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,650
um, what the content of
it would be. But it's,

152
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,740
it's the metaphor of a social contract
that shapes all reasoning about the way

153
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:18,681
in which you can organize
society scientifically in
order to preserve freedom.

154
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,710
So in the first two thirds of the course,

155
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:27,830
we're gonna work our way through
those three enlightenment traditions.

156
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,660
But every current has its undertow.

157
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,000
And even though the enlightenment
was this enormous Lee, uh,

158
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:39,570
energetic,
um,

159
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,680
and captivating tradition that really
starts in the 17th century and,

160
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,410
uh, get steam and gather
steam in the 18th century,

161
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,550
there was always resistance
to the enlightenment.

162
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:57,810
Both its preoccupation with science and
its view that individual freedom is the

163
00:11:58,661 --> 00:11:59,910
most important guard.

164
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,060
And so after we've done
looking at the enlightenment,

165
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,990
we're gonna look at anti
enlightenment thinking, um,

166
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:13,140
and the tradition that resists the idea
that there are scientific principles

167
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:19,290
around which society can be organized
and resist the idea that the freedom of

168
00:12:20,651 --> 00:12:23,440
the individual is the most important.
Good.

169
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:28,360
And we'll explore that tradition.
And then in the last part of the course,

170
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:33,220
we will turn to the democratic tradition,
which tries,

171
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,010
at least in the way I
will present this to you,

172
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,690
to reconcile the anti enlightened
men critique of the enlightenment,

173
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,740
uh,

174
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,740
with those elements of the enlightenment
that survive the Anti Enlightenment

175
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,880
Critique, if you see what I'm saying.
So democracy becomes the resolution,

176
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,610
uh, at least in the way I'll
describe democracy in this course,

177
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,240
thereby hangs. And now the tail light
I want to tell you about this course.

178
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,800
The course is a introductory and
presented in a user friendly way to to no

179
00:13:12,651 --> 00:13:17,560
commas, but it also is an argument
that is, I'm presenting an argument,

180
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:21,220
a point of view, which some of
you will be, I'm persuaded by,

181
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,410
and that is totally fine.

182
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,040
The idea is not to make you think what
I think or what your teaching assistant.

183
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,493
Thanks.

184
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,500
It's rare that to make you understand the
logic underlying your own views better

185
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:42,580
than you have before and
perhaps see the appeal of used,

186
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,990
you have hit it two rejected more
clearly than you have before.

187
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:51,820
So it's the idea is to
enhance the sophistication
of your own understanding of

188
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:54,520
politics,
not to have your parrot,

189
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:59,320
my views or teaching follows
views or anybody else's views. Um,

190
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:00,300
it's rare that too,

191
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:05,410
to understand the nature of your own
views and how they might connect a or live

192
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:10,960
intention with the views of others.

193
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,700
One thing you're going to find,
I should also say just as a,

194
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,910
as a matter of truth in advertising,

195
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,790
we're going to look at a number of what
I would call architectonic theories of

196
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:28,630
politics. That theories that
try to give the whole answer.

197
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,430
This is, you know, Jeremy Bentham,
this is his scientific theory.

198
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:35,440
These are all the pieces.
These are how they,

199
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:39,400
this is how they fit together and this
is what it means for the organization of

200
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:42,490
schools and prisons and all
amounts and all the rest of it.

201
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:47,860
He's got an architect on a theory of
the whole thing, John Roles as well.

202
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:52,370
You'll see an architectonic theory of the
whole thing. One of the things you're,

203
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:57,430
one of the takeaway points of this course
is going to be that architect tonic

204
00:14:57,681 --> 00:15:02,540
theories fail that there no,
there is no silver bullet.

205
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,590
You're not gonna find a takeaway,
um,

206
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:11,830
set of propositions that you can
plaster on to future political dilemmas.

207
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,090
What you're going to find instead,

208
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,330
I think what's going to
help you in this course,

209
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:20,360
what's going to be the useful takeaway,
uh,

210
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,900
is rather small and medium sized insights.

211
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:31,270
You're going to find things to put in
your conceptual bag of tricks and take and

212
00:15:31,941 --> 00:15:36,941
use elsewhere and they're going to be
very helpful to you in analyzing a whole

213
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:39,650
variety of problems.

214
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,730
I think if you talk to other
students have taken this course,

215
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,660
that tends to be the most useful,
uh,

216
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,100
the most useful takeaway,
uh,

217
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:56,150
that you get that you'll find when
somebody brings up an argument,

218
00:15:56,151 --> 00:15:59,390
say about what people are entitled to.

219
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,580
You'll have a whole series of questions
you would ask about that argument that

220
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:07,580
you wouldn't have asked if
you hadn't taken the scores.

221
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,250
So you'll find a lot of,
um,

222
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,130
small and medium sized bits and pieces
that you can take and use in other

223
00:16:16,131 --> 00:16:16,964
contexts,

224
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:21,970
but you're not gonna find it a one size
fits all answer to the basic dilemmas of

225
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:26,090
politics.
Um,

226
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:31,240
let me say one other thing about
this course is being an argument. Um,

227
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,750
uh, that, uh,

228
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:37,010
the arguments presented from
a particular point of view.

229
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,320
You might say, well, you know,
looking through the syllabus,

230
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:43,963
hmm,

231
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,480
this guy is pretty arrogant.
I mean, here we have,

232
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:54,350
you know, John Locke, John
stood male, Jeremy Bentham,

233
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,580
and he's got his own,
some of his own work here on the syllabus.

234
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,540
Who does he think he is? You know, I mean,

235
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:07,541
these are the greats of the tradition
and he's putting his own work here.

236
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,600
It takes a lot of Chutzpah to do that.

237
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:19,070
And let me tell you a little vignette
that I think will give you the spirit in

238
00:17:19,891 --> 00:17:24,150
which my work is on the syllabus.
When I was an undergraduate,

239
00:17:24,151 --> 00:17:28,590
there was a great con scholar
called Stefan Karna, uh,

240
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,920
who was here in the Yale philosophy
department for many years.

241
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,330
And also taught at the
University of Bristol in England.

242
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:41,870
And I attended his lectures on can't and
he stood up and the very first lecture,

243
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:48,210
and he said,
con was a great philosopher.

244
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,940
What?
I am a minor philosopher,

245
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,980
but with me,
you have the advantage that I am alive

246
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,810
now. This is the spirit in which, uh,

247
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:08,940
my work is that it's not remotely
intended to be a suggestion that 200 years

248
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:14,880
from now or 300 years from now, people
will be reading it or that it stands, uh,

249
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:17,830
on a par with the work that,
um,

250
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,040
the classic works of the tradition.

251
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:26,610
But one of our agendas in the scores is
not just to get you up to speed in the

252
00:18:29,051 --> 00:18:31,180
great texts of these different traditions,

253
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:35,260
but to give you some sense of
how people who currently do this,

254
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:38,590
we're living argue about these ideas.
Um,

255
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,610
so in each one of the five
traditions that we look at,

256
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,580
we're going to begin with
a classic formulation.

257
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:52,380
So Jeremy Bentham is the locus
classicus of classical utilitarianism.

258
00:18:53,531 --> 00:18:56,860
He's a major formative
statement of that view.

259
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,960
So we'll start with Bentham,

260
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:03,100
but then we will bring
utilitarianism up to the present day.

261
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,500
We will explore how diff,

262
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,670
how the utilitarian traditional
evolved since the 18th century.

263
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,120
And we will bring you up to contemporary
considerations about utilitarianism,

264
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:20,170
what people argue about in the journals
today and the book literature and so on.

265
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,350
Um,
likewise with Marxism,

266
00:19:23,351 --> 00:19:27,070
we'll start with Marx and Engels
themselves and then bring you up to

267
00:19:27,071 --> 00:19:32,071
contemporary debates about
Marxism social contract tradition.

268
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,790
We'll start with John Locke,

269
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:39,170
a WHO's famously formulated the social
contract idea in the 17th century,

270
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:44,920
but we'll bring it up to modern contract.
There were a slight Robic Nozick and,

271
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,030
and John Rawls,
the Anti Enlightenment tradition.

272
00:19:49,031 --> 00:19:52,270
We go back to Edmund Burke, the great, uh,

273
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:56,530
anti enlightenment thinker of the,
an opponent of the French revolution.

274
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:01,860
But we'll bring anti
enlightenment thinking up to
contemporary thinkers like a

275
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,050
Alisdair Macintyre.

276
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,450
And finally with the democratic tradition,
we'll go back to the,

277
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,530
the, uh, federalist papers,
which is what, uh, in,

278
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,570
in Wa in many ways,

279
00:20:16,571 --> 00:20:21,571
one of the most important statements
of what's at issue with democratic

280
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:24,760
principles,
if not a defense of democracy.

281
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:29,110
Will see later and bring that up to the
contemporary literature on democracy,

282
00:20:29,111 --> 00:20:33,970
which is where my own, uh,
thinking comes in. But, uh,

283
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,230
as I say,
you should,

284
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:40,320
you should remember Stefan
Carnez admonition that
you're getting the benefit of

285
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:45,610
the fact that I happened to be around
in the first decade of the 21st century.

286
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:46,600
Not that I'm

287
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:52,440
attempting to put myself
on that kind of a pedestal.

288
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:54,723
Now

289
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,230
I want to say a few more
general things about the course,

290
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:05,300
just to give you a sense of the flavor
of what we do here. You might say, well,

291
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:10,850
what is distinctive about this course
as compared with other introductory

292
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,240
political theory and political philosophy
courses that you could take around

293
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:16,970
here?

294
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:21,500
And I think there are four senses
in which this course is distinctive,

295
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,280
not necessarily better, but just
different. Uh, and so the, the, the,

296
00:21:26,281 --> 00:21:29,070
you can give you some sense of,
uh,

297
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,090
what it is that you would be
letting yourself in for here.

298
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:37,220
The first is what I've just mentioned,
that with each of these five traditions,

299
00:21:37,221 --> 00:21:41,780
we really are going to take,
take them from a classical formulation,

300
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:45,640
um,
up to contemporary discussions.

301
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:50,680
So you'll have a at least working sense
of how these traditions have evolved

302
00:21:51,681 --> 00:21:56,681
over the course of two or 300 years
and what form debates about them today.

303
00:21:58,701 --> 00:21:59,534
Take

304
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:06,830
the second is that this course has really
garn and mix the theoretical with the

305
00:22:07,681 --> 00:22:11,970
applied.
We're going to look at first principles.

306
00:22:11,971 --> 00:22:16,290
I use the term foundations advisedly
in the title of the course there.

307
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,220
Uh,

308
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:22,220
it's something of a loaded term in
that there are some people who think,

309
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,433
uh,

310
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:29,490
we should do political philosophy without
foundations and I'll have something to

311
00:22:29,491 --> 00:22:33,210
say about those arguments
later in the course. But we,

312
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,400
I do want to signal with that term,

313
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:38,400
we will be interested in
foundational questions.

314
00:22:38,401 --> 00:22:42,540
The most basic questions
you can ask about politic.

315
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,910
But we will never limit our intention
to those questions. We will,

316
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:53,150
we will work these doctrines through
a huge array of contemporary problems

317
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,310
ranging

318
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,860
from,
um,

319
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:03,160
abortion to affirmative action
to the death penalty to,

320
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,813
um,

321
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,840
all kinds of other things that are
of concern to you as we go through.

322
00:23:11,211 --> 00:23:16,211
So it's very much a part of what we do
in this course is to look at how these

323
00:23:17,571 --> 00:23:21,410
doctrines actually play out on the ground.
Um,

324
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:26,620
so we'd go back and forth from particular
examples to general arguments and

325
00:23:27,351 --> 00:23:31,850
backed in particular examples
a lot in this course. Um,

326
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,260
and in that sense it's,

327
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:38,350
it's more of a course I'd say in applied
political philosophy than many courses

328
00:23:39,771 --> 00:23:43,700
one might take, um, here or elsewhere.

329
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:46,990
A third,

330
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:52,460
the distinctive feature of the course is
that I'm going to organize it centrally

331
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:58,030
around one question,
which seems to me at the end of the day,

332
00:23:58,031 --> 00:24:00,970
to be the most important
question of politics.

333
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:06,750
And that is a question that I put in the
first sentence of the syllabus there.

334
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,890
When do governments deserve our allegiance
and when should they be denied it?

335
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,140
Okay.

336
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:18,520
When and under what conditions
should we obey the government?

337
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:23,620
When are we free to disobey
the government and when my,

338
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,770
we even have an obligation
to oppose the government.

339
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,650
Another way, if you want to translate
this into the jargon of political theory,

340
00:24:32,651 --> 00:24:36,700
it is what is it that makes
governments legitimate?

341
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:42,300
What is the basis for legitimate
government that is going to be the core

342
00:24:42,521 --> 00:24:47,521
organizing idea or question with
which we're going to interrogate these

343
00:24:47,891 --> 00:24:51,340
different traditions that we
examine utilitarian Marxists,

344
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,340
social contract, anti enlightenment
and democratic traditions.

345
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:00,730
We we're going to look at how does each
one of those traditions and said the

346
00:25:00,731 --> 00:25:04,900
most basic questions about
the legitimacy of the state.

347
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,950
Um, it's, as I say,

348
00:25:08,951 --> 00:25:13,090
I think it's ultimately the most
important question in politics.

349
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,430
It's not the only question in politics.

350
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:20,230
It's not the only way to organize
a course in political philosophy,

351
00:25:20,231 --> 00:25:22,660
but it is the way in which
we'll organize this course.

352
00:25:22,661 --> 00:25:27,661
We will focus our question on
legitimacy and that'll be the,

353
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:34,800
it'll provide the template for
comparing across these traditions,

354
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,730
right?
We will,

355
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:41,050
we will be looking at how utilitarians
or social contract theorist or democratic

356
00:25:41,051 --> 00:25:45,760
theorists look at this basic question
of what it is that makes governments

357
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,740
legitimate,
um,

358
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:52,270
how we know that when we fall over
it and what we should do about it.

359
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:54,770
Okay,

360
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:58,370
so that's the third sense in
which the course is distinctive.

361
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,170
And the fourth one I
want to mention is that

362
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:09,410
we're going to go back and forward
between two modes of analysis,

363
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:13,160
which for want of better terms,
I call internal and external,

364
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:17,180
and I may explain what
I mean by those terms.

365
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:23,590
When you look at an argument that somebody
puts forward and you look at it in a

366
00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:28,730
way that I'm describing as internal,
what you're basically saying is,

367
00:26:28,731 --> 00:26:31,100
does it make sense?
Is it persuasive?

368
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,970
Are the premises plausible?

369
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,430
Do the conclusions
follow from the premises?

370
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,840
Are there contradictions
in what the person's saying
this at all? Hang together?

371
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:45,090
Should I believe it?
That is it a good argument?

372
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,540
That's what internal analysis is about.
Okay.

373
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:54,770
External analysis is looking at the
argument as a causal force in the world.

374
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:58,883
What

375
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:05,220
social and political arrangements is
this argument used to justify or what

376
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,590
social and political arrangement
is it used to attack?

377
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:14,140
How does this operate as a political
ideology in the world out there?

378
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,120
What effects does it have
if I embraced this argument?

379
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:22,780
So it's not a question about whether or
not it's a good argument or you should

380
00:27:22,781 --> 00:27:23,614
believe it,

381
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:28,600
but a question about how this argument
is efficacious in the world because there

382
00:27:28,601 --> 00:27:32,890
could be terrible arguments that are
nonetheless very efficacious in the world,

383
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,623
right?

384
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:39,550
And there might be very good arguments
that nobody takes seriously and in day to

385
00:27:39,551 --> 00:27:40,540
day politics.

386
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:47,010
And one of the great aspirations of the
enlightenment is to produce arguments

387
00:27:48,581 --> 00:27:53,581
that both make good analytical
and philosophical sense
on the one hand and can

388
00:27:55,871 --> 00:27:57,760
be influential in the world on the other.

389
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:01,480
But those things don't
necessarily go together.

390
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:07,380
And we're going to ask
a question why in all,

391
00:28:08,651 --> 00:28:12,370
in the context of exploring all
of these traditions, why is that?

392
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,630
If there are good arguments that
are not efficacious, why that is?

393
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:20,560
Why is it if they're a bad
arguments that are efficacious,

394
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:24,850
why that is? Um, but in
any case, we're going to,

395
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,520
even if we can't answer that why question,

396
00:28:27,521 --> 00:28:32,110
which is a very hard question to answer,
we're going to look at these, these,

397
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:36,640
these arguments and these traditions
both internally and externally.

398
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,790
You're going to look at them as arguments
and you're going to look at them as

399
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:41,990
ideologies, as, um,

400
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,160
systems of thought that,

401
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:50,200
that get traffic then in
the political world. And,

402
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,063
um,

403
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:56,340
I think that that is another feature of
this course that differentiates it from

404
00:28:57,671 --> 00:29:01,600
other introductory
political theory courses.

405
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:07,050
So I think that gives you something of
a flavor of what is distinctive in what

406
00:29:09,401 --> 00:29:10,234
we do here.

407
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,550
Any questions about any of that?

408
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:20,980
If any of it's puzzling to you,
it's probably puzzling to somebody else.

409
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,370
So, in the spirit of, um,

410
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,950
getting us going,
we're going to start with a,

411
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,810
a real world problem.
We're going to start with

412
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:47,460
the problem of ad off Eichmann who
was a lieutenant colonel in the,

413
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,670
in Nazi Germany,

414
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:57,990
who was responsible for organizing the
shipment of Jews to Nazi death camps.

415
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,663
And

416
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,810
at the end of the war,
um,

417
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:12,570
he was captured along with a lot
of other former Nazis and he was

418
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,330
inadvertently released.

419
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:22,050
They didn't realize that
he was a significant player
in the organization of the

420
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:27,370
so called final solution of the Jews.
And they,

421
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,830
they released him and he escaped.

422
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:33,820
And like many other
former Nazis who escape,

423
00:30:33,821 --> 00:30:38,310
he went to Argentina and he
lived under an assumed name, uh,

424
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:43,470
for many years until the late 1950s
when the Israeli secret service,

425
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:50,041
the Mossad figured out that he was
there and figured out who he was.

426
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,800
And they sent a group of people who,
uh,

427
00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:00,460
essentially commandos who captured him,

428
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,940
spirited him out of Argentina,

429
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:08,620
took him to Israel where they
brought back the death penalty,

430
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:12,700
which had not existed at
that time in Israeli law.

431
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,420
Tried him for crimes against humanity,

432
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:21,250
which is the same concept that had been
employed at the Nuremberg trials, uh,

433
00:31:21,251 --> 00:31:24,070
off his cohort,
um,

434
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:29,710
after world war two in the late 1940
is crimes against humanity and crimes

435
00:31:29,711 --> 00:31:32,920
against the Jewish people.
And they executed him.

436
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:39,070
And at that time, young political
theorists, not particularly well known,

437
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:43,180
um,
called Hannah aren't covered.

438
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:48,181
The trial for the New Yorker magazine
in a series of articles which was

439
00:31:49,331 --> 00:31:53,500
subsequently published as a book
called Eichmann in Jerusalem,

440
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,700
which is what I'm having you
read full Wednesday's class

441
00:31:58,810 --> 00:31:59,643
and

442
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,080
we're going to use this Eichmann problem
as a way into the central conundrum of

443
00:32:09,571 --> 00:32:12,030
the course,
which I said is what,

444
00:32:12,031 --> 00:32:15,540
what is it that gives state's
legitimate legitimacy?

445
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,520
When should we obey the government?

446
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:21,890
Why don't we free not to and
when should we have perhaps, uh,

447
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:25,800
even be obliged to oppose the government?

448
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:30,830
Cause this problem was thrown into
sharp relief by the conduct of Eichmann

449
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,370
during World War Two.

450
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,190
And I want you think about

451
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,720
two questions

452
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,320
while you'd read this,
this,

453
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:51,270
which is essentially this book is
essentially a compilation of [inaudible],

454
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,950
a New Yorker articles.

455
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:59,590
The first is IPI.
What I want you to do is to think

456
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,320
about what the two things are that make
you most uncomfortable about this man

457
00:33:07,691 --> 00:33:11,050
who you'll get to know quite
well for reading this book.

458
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,380
What is it about him that is unnerving?

459
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:18,430
What is it that makes your
flesh crawl about this guy?

460
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:23,680
What are the two things that are
the most appalling about him?

461
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:30,490
And then the other question I want
you to address is the second one.

462
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:37,500
What two things make you
most uncomfortable about

463
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,980
the events surrounding his apprehension
and his child and his execution in

464
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:44,814
Israel.

465
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,730
Those are your reading
questions for [inaudible]

466
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:59,830
and write them down and bring him
with you to class on Wednesday.

467
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,880
Let me just say one other thing.
I see we,

468
00:34:02,881 --> 00:34:07,810
we were actually got five extra
minutes here. Generally speaking,

469
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,220
we have a lot to cover. We
will stick to the syllabus. Uh,

470
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,440
this course runs exactly as
described in the syllabus,

471
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,710
but we don't have a lot of,
uh,

472
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,800
there's not a lot of dead time and it's
really important to me that we be able

473
00:34:26,351 --> 00:34:29,670
to start right on the button.
Um,

474
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,350
yeah.

475
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:36,180
And I will, I will not run over. I
will always finish at 10 20 at 1120.

476
00:34:36,181 --> 00:34:38,670
I know we pay by by the places to get to,

477
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,570
but it's really important that you're
trying to get here ready to go,

478
00:34:42,571 --> 00:34:47,430
because you know, if it's, if it's
20 of 11 before we really get going,

479
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:51,810
um, it doesn't leave a lot of time
to cover what I want to cover.

480
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:56,460
And, um, so my, I, I promise to you,

481
00:34:56,461 --> 00:35:00,540
I will not run over, but
please, uh, do everybody,

482
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:04,050
including yourselves a favor
by trying to get here, uh,

483
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:09,330
as promptly as you can so
that we can start. Okay.

484
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,370
Uh, we'll look forward to
seeing you on Wednesday.
