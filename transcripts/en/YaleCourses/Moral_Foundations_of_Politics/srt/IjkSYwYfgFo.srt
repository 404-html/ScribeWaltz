1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,380
Where we ended with last Wednesday was
the tail end of our discussion of the

2
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:11,790
Anti enlightenment.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,360
And I think some of you discussed in
section the difficulties that arise when

4
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:23,700
you think about the complete rejection
of the enlightenment project.

5
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,140
For instance,

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,360
I think a very dramatic example that
fixes our intuition's very quickly,

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,900
um, is the, is the example that
I know some of you discussed,

8
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:40,860
which is that in the 1950s
in the United States,

9
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,010
there was no such thing as marital rape.

10
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:47,310
We can remember this from
our discussion of male. Um,

11
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,610
the wife was the channel of the husband
and her legal identity was suspended,

12
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,010
uh,
for the course of the marriage.

13
00:00:56,011 --> 00:01:00,990
And she was not only could a husband
not be prosecuted for raping his wife,

14
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:03,180
he could not be prosecuted for assault.

15
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:08,190
You could not be prosecuted for doing
all kinds of things to her that if he did

16
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:12,530
it to some on unrelated
person on the street, uh,

17
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,870
would land him in jail or worse.
Um,

18
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:21,230
now if you think about Macintyre's
discussion of practices in the 1950s,

19
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,310
this was an accepted norm
of the prevailing practice.

20
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:31,311
And the argument that this should be seen
as unjust or unacceptable wouldn't get

21
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:36,921
any purchase from an ethic that
was based on the idea that,

22
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:38,790
um,

23
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,350
we missed except inherited
conditions and norms and practices.

24
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,080
And so, um, the,

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,120
the one important takeaway point
from that is however difficult the

26
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:57,820
enlightenment ideas of individual
rights and trying to make, um,

27
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:02,830
objective statements about what goes on
within systems of Human Association is

28
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,010
however difficult that enlightenment
project is giving up on a completely

29
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,250
presents even more in Superbowl problems
because very few people are really

30
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:21,471
going to want to go all the way with
abandoning the idea that the individual

31
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:26,811
should be subordinated to community
norms and practices and abandoning the

32
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:32,280
notion that we can appeal
only to tradition in, um,

33
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,310
thinking about,
um,

34
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,320
whether or not conditions as we've
inherited them are acceptable and so

35
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,830
entered democracy.

36
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,830
The last section of the course in which
we're going to talk about a tradition

37
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,630
which I think does a better job than
any that we have considered here.

38
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:55,464
The two,

39
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,400
in delivering on the promise
of the mature enlightenment,

40
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,460
the promise to recognize individual
rights as the most important normative,

41
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:11,671
ideal and to base politics on
some commitment to objective
knowledge about human

42
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:21,400
society. Um, that goes beyond the,

43
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,650
um,
beliefs,

44
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:29,070
commitments and practices of whoever
happens to be around and whatever values

45
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:33,430
they happen to have.
Now,

46
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:38,260
one thing about democracy
that distinguishes it from
all of the traditions we've

47
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:43,261
considered thus far is that it's a
tradition that was made famous by it's

48
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:48,370
critics. If you think about the
ones we've considered thus far,

49
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:49,204
you know,

50
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,850
the social contract was made
famous by Hobbes and Locke.

51
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,720
A utilitarianism was
made famous by Bentham.

52
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,070
Marxism obviously made famous by marks.
These will all,

53
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,080
um,
the,

54
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,490
these were all ways of looking at the
world that had their champions and it was

55
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:14,491
the champions that made the case for
why we should behave in accordance with

56
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:19,570
their dictates. And with the
inland anti enlightenment as well,

57
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:23,890
it was Burke as the big champion
of the Anti Enlightenment.

58
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:28,120
And then we looked at some modern
anti enlightenment thinkers.

59
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:33,330
Democracy was made famous by it's critics.

60
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,050
Who Do you think this is? Any
guesses? Who is that on the left?

61
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:42,370
That Jen on the left.

62
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,510
Nobody now nobody wanted get who's that?
Yeah.

63
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,900
Close. Huh? Okay.

64
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:57,360
Who is the [inaudible] the right.

65
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,590
Anyone the first one to get it
gets a free book. Yeah, you got it.

66
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,930
Come and see me later. You'll
get your free book. Um,

67
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,953
okay.

68
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,090
These are both people who were
not champions of democracy.

69
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,003
MMM.

70
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,890
They were worried about

71
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,380
the potential that
democracy has four tyranny.

72
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:30,740
Let's listen to Plato.
I don't know if you can read that,

73
00:05:30,741 --> 00:05:33,350
but I'll read it to you and
don't try and write it down.

74
00:05:33,351 --> 00:05:37,150
I will put it up on the uh,
server.

75
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,200
Plato has two very famous
analogies in the, in the republic,

76
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,270
which sum up his appalling
disdain for democracy.

77
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,291
He says,

78
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:53,291
imagine then a fleet or a ship in which
there is a captain who is taller and

79
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,180
stronger than any of the crew,

80
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,960
but he is a little deaf and has a similar
infirmity insight and his knowledge of

81
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,560
navigation is not much better.
Kind of dopey old captain.

82
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,250
The sailors are quarreling with
one another about the steering.

83
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,680
Everyone is of the opinion
that he has the right to steer.

84
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,860
Though he has never learned the art of
navigation and cannot tell who taught him

85
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,330
or when he learned and will further
assert that a cat that it cannot be toward

86
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,670
and that they are all ready to cut to
pieces. Anyone who says the contrary,

87
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,890
they throng about the captain begging and
praying him to commit the helm to them.

88
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,060
And if at any time they do not prevail
but others are preferred to them,

89
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:40,970
they kill the others with
throw them overboard.

90
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:45,320
And having first chained up the Nobels
captain senses with drink or some

91
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,460
narcotic drug,

92
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,650
they mutiny and take possession of the
ship and make free with the stores.

93
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,240
Thus eating and drinking.

94
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:57,620
They proceed on their voyage in such
a manner as might be expected of them.

95
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,880
Him who is their partisan and cleverly
aids them in their plot for getting the

96
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:08,000
ship out of the captain's
hands and into their own, uh,

97
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:09,830
whether by force or persuasion,

98
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:13,220
they compliment with
the name of Salem pilot,

99
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:18,221
able seaman and abused the other sort
of man with whom they call a good,

100
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,900
whom they call a good for nothing,

101
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,960
but that the true pilot must pay attention
to the year and the seasons and the

102
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:31,550
sky and the stars and the wind and
whatever else belongs to his art.

103
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,490
If he intends to be really
qualified to command a shit.

104
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:41,230
Now in vessels which are in a state of
now in vessels which are in a state of

105
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:44,690
mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers,

106
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,700
how will a true pilot be regarded Willie
and not be called by them a pray to a

107
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:52,910
star gazer or a good for nothing.

108
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:59,290
And then Plato's other famous analogy
which looks at the masses rather than uh,

109
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,790
how they will manipulate the government.
He says,

110
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:10,150
suppose a man was in charge of a large
and powerful animal and made a study of

111
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:11,511
its moods.

112
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:16,511
And once he would learn when to approach
it and handle it when and Wyatt was

113
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,860
especially savage or gentle,

114
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,390
what the different noises it made
meant and what the tone of voice,

115
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:27,740
what tone of voice to to use
to sue that or to annoy it.

116
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:33,370
All those he might learn
by long experience and
familiarity and then call it a

117
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:38,471
science and reduce it to a
system and set up to teach it.

118
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,700
But he would not really know what the,

119
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:45,770
which of the chicest tastes and
desires was admirable or shameful,

120
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,200
good or bad,
right or wrong.

121
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,100
He would simply use the terms
on the basis of its reactions,

122
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:57,360
calling what it pleased good and what
place did go ahead and what annoyed it

123
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,520
bad. So Plato didn't have
much regard for democracy.

124
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,780
Not surprisingly because in three 99 BC,

125
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,890
it,

126
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:12,890
the democracy in Athens at executed
his hero and teach us Socrates,

127
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,400
um,

128
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,400
precisely for pointing out the sorts of
lack of knowledge that he is alluding to

129
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:22,231
here,

130
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:27,231
both in the ship's captain analogy
and I'm playing to the mob sentiments,

131
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,320
um, that he's alluding
to with the, um, this,

132
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:39,460
this analogy of the power of the people
in a democratic system as being a

133
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:42,030
powerful animal.

134
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,240
And so Plato was very unimpressed with
democracy as a potential system of rural.

135
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,770
He thought it would quickly
collapse into charity.

136
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:59,270
The phrase that tyranny of the majority
though was made popular by Alexis de

137
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,160
Tocqueville.
You've already run into this.

138
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:06,160
When we talked about
mill's harm principle. Um,

139
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:10,290
Tocqueville was a 19th
century French aristocrat who,

140
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,320
who went to America to try and understand
how American democracy work because it

141
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:21,741
seemed to him less destructive of
freedom and individual liberties.

142
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,800
Then what was coming
down the pike in Europe,

143
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,440
he thought the French aristocracy and,

144
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,670
and the French monarchy was way too short
sighted in not seeing that they have

145
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:40,341
to understand the egalitarian trends
of modern history and to create

146
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:46,620
institutions that could lose sue them
and control them and domesticate them.

147
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,040
So people think of Tocqueville often is
a great defender of democracy and in a

148
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:56,940
certain sense he was.
But he was also a critic of democracy.

149
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,620
And I'll go into that a little
bit more detail shortly. Um, but,

150
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,680
but his main reason for thinking that
American democracy was a relatively good

151
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:13,221
system was its propensity to
limit egalitarian impulses,

152
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,510
uh, that he thought were
breaking out all over Europe.

153
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:24,110
And so Tocqueville's summation of his
fear of the tyranny of the majority comes,

154
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,610
um, in, in a democracy
in America. He says,

155
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,820
when I see that the right and the means
of absolute control are conferred on any

156
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:39,330
power, whatever, be it
called a people or a king,

157
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,010
an aristocracy or democracy,
a monarchy or a republic.

158
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,730
I say there is the germ of tyranny
and I s and I seek to live elsewhere.

159
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,350
And to other lawyers.
In my opinion,

160
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:57,730
the main eval of the present
democratic institutions.

161
00:11:57,731 --> 00:12:02,731
The United States does not arise as
it's often asserted in Europe from their

162
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:06,770
weakness,
but from the irresistible strength.

163
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,490
I am not so much alarmed at the excessive
liberty which rains in that country as

164
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:15,640
as in the inadequate securities,

165
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:20,641
which one finds their against tyranny
and individual or a party is wronged in

166
00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:23,080
the United States.

167
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,890
If an individual or a party has
wronged in the United States,

168
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,270
to whom can he apply for redress?
If to public opinion,

169
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:36,400
public opinion constitutes the
majority if to the legislature.

170
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,360
It represents the majority
and implicitly obeys it.

171
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,810
If the executive power it is appointed
by the majority and serves as a passive

172
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:47,860
tool in its hands.

173
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,520
The public force consists
of the majority on the arms.

174
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:56,440
The jury is the majority invested with
the right of hearing judicial cases and

175
00:12:56,441 --> 00:13:00,880
in certain states, even the judges
are elected by the majority.

176
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,430
However, iniquitous or absurd,
the measure of which you complain,

177
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,240
you must submit to it as well as you can.

178
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,960
So democracy brings with it this
problem of the tyranny of the majority.

179
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:21,510
And it was after all we saw earlier in
this course against that that John Stuart

180
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:24,340
mill erected his harm principle.

181
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:29,230
He too had this great fear
of tyranny of the majority.

182
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,230
And so as I said,

183
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,030
democracy was made famous
first by it's critics.

184
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:42,450
And they point out that it
has this propensity to panda
to mass opinion without

185
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:48,481
regard to whether it's true or false and
to ride roughshod over the individual

186
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:50,620
rights,
uh,

187
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:55,621
again without regard to whether
this produces a domination or worse.

188
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,540
Um,
so that being the case,

189
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:06,930
it seems like prime of facie and not
very encouraging to think that democracy

190
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:14,161
can deliver on the enlightenment where
we talking about politics that's based on

191
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:16,450
science and politics

192
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,460
that respect individual rights.

193
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,820
And so you might given reading
mail as you have given what I,

194
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:33,361
the little bit of Plato and Russo that
I've just shown to you and your own

195
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:38,770
thinking about, um, politics.

196
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,990
As you confront it day today,

197
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,320
you might well be skeptical of the
proposition that democracy is going to

198
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:51,250
deliver very well on the
mature enlightenment.

199
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:56,710
And so just how that might be the case
is what's going to concern us for this.

200
00:14:57,261 --> 00:15:00,170
And then the next three lectures,

201
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:09,130
and we're going to start out consideration
of democracy with the federalist

202
00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:10,904
papers.

203
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,720
The federalist papers are
probably along with roles,

204
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,900
the two most important pieces of political
theory ever to come out of America.

205
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:26,803
Um,

206
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:32,080
they were a series of articles published
in the newspapers of New York state,

207
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:37,070
as I'm sure most of you know,
uh,

208
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,160
in order to try and help get
the constitution ratified.

209
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,970
They were,
although Orthod by these three gentlemen,

210
00:15:47,971 --> 00:15:52,620
James Madison Alexandre Habel Ah,
how Hamilton and John Jay,

211
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,140
they were signed by the night
with the pseudonym Publius,

212
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:03,330
which was short for poor bliss,
hilarious public Carla,

213
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:08,331
who was reputed to be the console who had
restored the Roman Republic in five Oh

214
00:16:10,141 --> 00:16:11,250
nine BC,

215
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:16,380
whether in fact it is a at
that's debated by historians.

216
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,730
Um,
the constitution,

217
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:23,220
by the time they wrote these,

218
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,810
the vast majority of these papers,

219
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,840
these letters to the people of New
York had already been approved by the

220
00:16:33,841 --> 00:16:38,530
majority of the 13 states if bought.

221
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,423
Um,

222
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:46,170
few people believe that it
would survive if it wasn't, uh,

223
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,350
um, adopted in New York. Uh, the,

224
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:53,550
the confederate
constitution it provide had,

225
00:16:53,551 --> 00:16:57,780
had required unanimity for the
adoption of the constitution.

226
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,250
But in the, the actual constitution
itself, they had said, well,

227
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:05,130
nine out of the 13 states will be enough,

228
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:10,131
but nobody really thought it could
survive if it was not adopted in New York.

229
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,350
And so the federalists

230
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,690
took upon themselves
the task, um, Hamilton,

231
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,720
Madison and Jay up persuading the p
the people of New York to support the

232
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:29,000
adoption of the constitution.

233
00:17:29,001 --> 00:17:33,320
And indeed they were
successful in that endeavor.

234
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,373
Yeah.

235
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:41,670
But they had the fear of this problem
of majority tyranny that I've already

236
00:17:42,251 --> 00:17:45,720
alluded to with respect to Plato and,
um,

237
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,480
male and Tocqueville front
and in their considerations.

238
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,650
And [inaudible]

239
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,320
two shouldn't be surprised that they
would worry about that because if you

240
00:18:02,321 --> 00:18:06,190
imagine yourself back
into the 18th century,

241
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,590
thinking about democracy.

242
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:10,130
Okay.

243
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,320
The ancient ideal of democracy,

244
00:18:12,321 --> 00:18:17,321
the ancient Athenian ideal of democracy
had basically been the notion of ruling

245
00:18:17,361 --> 00:18:21,200
and being ruled in term.
So,

246
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,760
you know, if you have an
academic department, let's say,

247
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,580
let's set aside the problem, the
issue of, of untenured faculty.

248
00:18:31,581 --> 00:18:34,730
Just imagine a a department
of tenured faculty,

249
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:40,460
we have a circulating chair, right?
Somebody chair for three years,

250
00:18:40,461 --> 00:18:42,050
then somebody else,
then somebody else.

251
00:18:42,051 --> 00:18:45,350
That's the notion of ruling
and being ruled in turn.

252
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,920
And the reason you can do that is
that everybody basically has the same

253
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,004
interest.

254
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,440
Okay?

255
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,440
You don't have to worry about monitoring
or controlling the current ruler

256
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,880
because basically they have the
same interest as you do. Um,

257
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,720
and they're not therefore going to do
anything with the collective that you

258
00:19:07,721 --> 00:19:08,920
wouldn't do yourself.

259
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,120
So that's the ancient ideal of
democracy is ruling and being ruled.

260
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,380
In turn it, it obviously in
the case of ancient Greece,

261
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:22,150
it excluded women at
excluded slaves. So, um,

262
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,520
it was, uh, a certain, uh,

263
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:29,580
truncated conception of a democratic
community about which people of discourse

264
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:31,244
that great length.

265
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:36,930
But given that the model was the idea
that you could have a ruling and being

266
00:19:37,781 --> 00:19:42,781
ruled in turn without loss because
everyone was assumed basically to have the

267
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:46,720
same interests.
Now,

268
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,470
as soon as you get a
diversity of interests,

269
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,713
that

270
00:19:55,070 --> 00:20:00,070
mechanism of government goes off
the table as a way of doing things.

271
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,920
Because then you might have subgroups
who see that let's suppose you introduce

272
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,860
nontenured faculty,

273
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,550
they're going to have a very different
interest than the tenured faculty.

274
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,590
And so the idea of ruling
and being ruled in turn, uh,

275
00:20:18,591 --> 00:20:23,480
wouldn't work anymore. Once you have
a serious division of interest within,

276
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,880
within the polity,
you have this problem.

277
00:20:27,881 --> 00:20:32,881
And this is the problem Madison
articulates in federalist
number 10 when he says

278
00:20:33,491 --> 00:20:37,120
by a faction,
I understand a number of citizens,

279
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:42,390
whether amounting to a majority or a
minority of the hall who are United and

280
00:20:43,091 --> 00:20:48,091
actuated by some common impulse of passion
or interest adverse to the rights of

281
00:20:49,841 --> 00:20:54,841
other citizens or to the permanent and
aggregate interests of the community.

282
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,260
So once you have factions,
you have this problem,

283
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,263
right?

284
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,960
If you're the majority faction,
it doesn't matter to you,

285
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,320
but it does if you're the minority
faction because things are gonna happen

286
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,380
you don't like.

287
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:26,710
So the first thing Madison says to himself
is, what could we get rid of factions?

288
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,790
And, and if you read
federalist number 10 carefully,

289
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,430
you will see that he thinks that the,

290
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:39,630
the costs of doing that would be so great
in terms of lost human freedom and the

291
00:21:40,721 --> 00:21:45,670
kind of repression you would
have to engage in. Uh, you know,

292
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:49,930
it would look like the French
revolution or the Russian revolution,

293
00:21:49,931 --> 00:21:53,270
which of course he didn't
know about, but which, uh,

294
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,330
he didn't know about
either of those things,

295
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:57,820
but he wouldn't have
been surprised by them.

296
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,850
Uh, when, uh,

297
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,280
he wrote this,
so you can't get rid of factions.

298
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:11,910
The causes of factions can't be removed
and therefore you have to look at their

299
00:22:12,671 --> 00:22:13,630
effects.

300
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,830
He says the Leighton causes of
faction or sewn in the nature of man,

301
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,660
and we see them everywhere brought into
different degrees of activity according

302
00:22:22,661 --> 00:22:25,870
to the different circumstances
of civil society.

303
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,320
So strong is this propensity of mankind
to fall into mutual animosities that

304
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,800
were no substantial
occasion presents itself.

305
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:40,801
The most frivolous and
fanciful distinctions have
been sufficient to kindle the

306
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:46,441
unfriendly passions and excite the most
violent conflicts by the most common and

307
00:22:47,381 --> 00:22:48,520
durable source of.

308
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:52,780
But the most common and durable sorts
of factions has been the various unequal

309
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:55,000
distribution of property.

310
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:00,420
Those who hold and those who are without
property have formed distinct interests

311
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:04,450
in society.
Those who are credit is,

312
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:08,560
and those who are dead is fall
under like discrimination, uh,

313
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:09,520
landed interest,

314
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:14,020
a manufacturing interest and merch until
interest and moneyed interest with many

315
00:23:14,021 --> 00:23:14,500
lessons,

316
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,500
interest grow up off necessity in
civilized nations and divide them into

317
00:23:20,141 --> 00:23:24,520
different classes,
actuated by different sentiments in views.

318
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:30,180
The regulation of these various and
interfering interests forms the principal

319
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:35,431
task of modern legislation and involves
the spirit of party and faction in the

320
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:40,921
necessary an ordinary operations of
government managing factions so that they

321
00:23:44,351 --> 00:23:49,351
don't destroy the common interest
is the basic business of politics.

322
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,713
Now,

323
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,890
how do you do that?
Well,

324
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,820
how do you manage

325
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:11,140
the effects of faction?
He goes on and he says,

326
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,730
the smaller the society,

327
00:24:12,731 --> 00:24:16,570
the fewer probably will be the distinct
parties and interest composing it.

328
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,100
The fewer the distinct parties
and interest. The more frequently,

329
00:24:21,101 --> 00:24:26,050
well a majority be found of the same
party and the smaller the number of

330
00:24:26,051 --> 00:24:30,790
individuals composing a majority and the
smaller the compass within which they

331
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:35,791
are placed the more easily we'll they
concert and execute their plans of

332
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,430
oppression.
Oops,

333
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:45,230
extend the sphere and you take in a
greater variety of parties and interests.

334
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,440
You make it less probable that a majority
of the hall we'll have a common motive

335
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,180
to invade the rights of other citizens.

336
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,210
Or if such a common motive exists,

337
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,050
it will be more difficult
for all who feel of it.

338
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:05,140
Feel it to discover their own strength
and to act in unison with each other.

339
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,940
Besides other impediments,

340
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:12,710
it may be remarked that where there is a
consciousness of unjust or dishonorable

341
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:13,544
purposes,

342
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,700
communication is always checked
by distrust in proportion
of the number who's a

343
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:21,050
concurrence is necessary.

344
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,300
Hence it clearly appears that the same
advantage which a republic has over a

345
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:31,301
democracy and controlling the effects
of faction is enjoyed by a large over a

346
00:25:32,121 --> 00:25:33,140
small republic.

347
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:39,800
Isn't is enjoyed by the Union
of the States Union over
the states comprising it.

348
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:45,850
I will talk in a little while about what
advantages Madison thinks a republic

349
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:47,360
has over a democracy.

350
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,720
But right now I want to focus on his
this other point which is that a large

351
00:25:53,121 --> 00:25:57,170
republic has an advantage
over a small republic.

352
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,680
It's society had that has no factions
at all presents no problems for four

353
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:08,111
democratic theory as we've already talked
about in connection with the stylized

354
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:13,391
idea of ancient Greece as one in which
everybody has the same interests and you

355
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:19,841
can have rules and being ruled in turn
ruling and being ruled in turn what

356
00:26:22,161 --> 00:26:27,161
Madison is most afraid off is a single
faction I majority faction because if you

357
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:33,530
have a society in which um,

358
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:39,010
there's a majority that agrees all the
time or most of the time the problem is

359
00:26:41,451 --> 00:26:44,820
what about these people
that are going to be

360
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,560
okay

361
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,580
on the losing end.

362
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:52,581
So if you have a society in which race
and class and religion all tend to fall

363
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:56,640
along the same division,

364
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,050
okay,

365
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,850
these people are either going to be

366
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,390
okay,

367
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:04,300
have to knuckle down to tyranny,
right?

368
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,110
Or they're going to reach
where they had guns.

369
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:14,080
They'll overthrow the system if they can.
And if they cannot,

370
00:27:14,081 --> 00:27:16,870
they might as well become criminals,
right?

371
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:22,170
They're not going to have an incentive
to participate in the democratic order.

372
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:28,120
And so from Madison's point of view,

373
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:32,870
this is the ideal society.
You know, we think, you know,

374
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,930
modern Polen 99% Catholic
or something like that. Um,

375
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:42,280
but even there that there are other
divisions. So even there it doesn't work.

376
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,520
But if you're going to have factions,

377
00:27:45,521 --> 00:27:48,640
the worst thing to have
is one or a small number.

378
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,970
What you really want is lots of factions,

379
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:57,290
cross cutting cleavages as we talk
about them in modern political science.

380
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:04,000
The notion here is if you're
in a majority on one question,

381
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,310
but you know,

382
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:12,311
you might be on in a different majority
or in the minority on the next question,

383
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,150
okay?

384
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:19,920
Then you have both the reason to temper
your own behavior when you're in the

385
00:28:19,921 --> 00:28:23,160
majority and not tyrannized
over the minority.

386
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,080
And if you're in the minority,

387
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,700
you have reasons to accept
your loss this time around.

388
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:35,370
You know, as, as people always say,
when the team loses the weld series,

389
00:28:35,371 --> 00:28:39,270
there's always next year,
right? There's always next time.

390
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:44,990
So next time you might be part of some
different coalition and you might be able

391
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,600
to prevail.
So

392
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:56,850
the best, the best we could have would
be a world with no factions at all.

393
00:28:56,851 --> 00:28:59,670
But that's unrealistic in modern times,

394
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:04,671
particularly once you have an economic
division of Labor class divisions,

395
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,820
um,
uh,

396
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,980
as Tocqueville would, would, uh,

397
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,900
point out 40 years later.

398
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,183
MMM.

399
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,640
And so then what you need is lots of
factions and that's why Madison argued you

400
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:25,550
need a big republic,
right?

401
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,790
Because the larger the republic,

402
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:33,910
the more likely it is that you're going
to have multiple cross cutting cleavages

403
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,290
and then the system,

404
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:41,530
we sometimes defined democracy
as institutionalized of outcomes.

405
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,020
You don't know,

406
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,730
you don't know what the
majority is going to decide.

407
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,180
Yeah.

408
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,790
We don't know when, uh, if,

409
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:57,420
let's suppose President Obama nominates,

410
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,713
mmm,

411
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,190
justice would for the court,

412
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,790
we don't know what the outcome will be.

413
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:14,590
So everybody will participate and lobby
and so on to try and affect the result.

414
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,890
Um, people will talk about
coalitions and, or you know,

415
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,220
a more dramatic case.

416
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:26,221
I think when George Bush Sr nominated
Clarence Thomas to the supreme court,

417
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,170
it split the African American
community right down the middle, right?

418
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:37,171
Because there were people who were largely
Democrats who also wanted an African

419
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,330
American justice on the court.
The,

420
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:45,340
a good example of cross cutting
bases of political affiliation,

421
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,200
right?
And so the,

422
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,400
the Madisonian idea is that
that's actually a good thing.

423
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,880
It's institutionalized uncertainty of
outcomes prevents the terrorizing of some

424
00:30:57,821 --> 00:30:58,660
groups.
Have A,

425
00:30:58,661 --> 00:31:03,640
this at gives everybody an incentive
to remain committed to the process.

426
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And that is what would subsequently
become call the pluralist theory of

427
00:31:09,071 --> 00:31:14,071
democracy associated most famously
in the 20th century with Robert Dahl,

428
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:20,470
who was on the Yale Faculty for
decades and decades and is still,

429
00:31:20,471 --> 00:31:25,210
it's about to turn actually
95 years old this year. Uh,

430
00:31:25,211 --> 00:31:27,580
and he lives in new haven.
Um,

431
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,640
probably the most famous
democratic theorist, um,

432
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,900
of the second half of the 20th century.

433
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:40,140
The pluralist theory of democracy belts
on this Madisonian idea that what you

434
00:31:41,681 --> 00:31:45,310
want is institutionalized
uncertainty of outcomes.

435
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,750
That is a byproduct of crosscutting.

436
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:53,830
Cleavage is multiple cross cutting
cleavages so that witness have reason.

437
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,340
President winters have reason to,
uh,

438
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:02,370
limit the amount in which they tear
an over losers and present losers have

439
00:32:04,031 --> 00:32:08,080
incentives to remain committed
to the process for the future.

440
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,430
There's always next year you
want people to believe that, uh,

441
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,460
in order to keep them committed.

442
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:21,530
But that wasn't enough for Madison.

443
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:29,540
No, that was the basis of his
argument for an extended a union.

444
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:33,110
Um,
but it wasn't enough for Madison.

445
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,250
He was worried that the
institutional structure,

446
00:32:37,251 --> 00:32:40,730
just as Tocqueville articulated it,
um,

447
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,040
in the 19th century,

448
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,180
that the institutional structure
could facilitate tyranny.

449
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,260
Okay.

450
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:53,520
He says the greatest security against
the gradual concentration of the several

451
00:32:53,521 --> 00:32:58,470
powers in the same department consists
in giving to those who administer each of

452
00:32:58,471 --> 00:33:00,780
the departments,
each department,

453
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,200
the necessary constitutional means and
personal motives to resist encroachments

454
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,210
of others.

455
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,970
The provision for defense must in this,
as in all other cases,

456
00:33:14,971 --> 00:33:17,940
be commensurate to the danger of the task.

457
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,740
Ambition must be made
to counteract ambition.

458
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:25,930
Maybe the most famous
line Madison ever wrote,

459
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,180
ambition must be made
to counteract ambition.

460
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,340
The interest of the man must be connected
with the constitutional rights of the

461
00:33:35,341 --> 00:33:36,174
place.

462
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:41,360
It may be a reflection of human nature
that such devices should be necessary to

463
00:33:41,971 --> 00:33:46,950
control the abuses of
government. Now, the famous line,

464
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,620
if men were angels,
whoops,

465
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,820
if men were angels,
no government would be necessary.

466
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,070
If angels were to govern men,

467
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:03,280
neither external nor internal controls
on government would be necessary in

468
00:34:03,531 --> 00:34:08,480
framing a government, which is to
be administered by men over men.

469
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,180
The great different the lies in this,

470
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:16,390
you must first enable the government to
control the governed and next oblige it

471
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:18,500
to control itself.

472
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:24,130
A dependence on the people is no doubt
the primary control of the government,

473
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,560
but experience has taught mankind the
next set and the necessity of auxiliary

474
00:34:31,131 --> 00:34:33,680
precautions.
So

475
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:40,290
your basic
guarantor is the,

476
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,383
the,

477
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,493
mmm

478
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:48,560
crosscutting cleavages among the
people and extended republic.

479
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,960
But that's not enough because,
and this is really a,

480
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:59,390
a view that most famously associated
with the 19th century liberal British

481
00:35:01,701 --> 00:35:02,970
thing.
Lord Acton,

482
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:07,990
when he said power corrupts and
absolute power corrupts absolutely.

483
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:13,490
The notion is that you really
have to divide up power.

484
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,690
You have to have an institutional scheme.

485
00:35:16,691 --> 00:35:19,040
That's is an auxiliary precautions,

486
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,400
an institutional scheme which causes
people in the different branches of

487
00:35:26,671 --> 00:35:29,310
government to check one another.

488
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:36,080
And so we'd get what Madison called a
nonorganic or republic rather than a

489
00:35:38,131 --> 00:35:40,770
democracy. Uh, and in that sense,

490
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:45,720
Madison is a critic of democracy,
just like Tocqueville, uh,

491
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,390
beef, uh, and just like Plato,

492
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:53,810
they wanted to say that pure democracy
leads to tyranny and we have to check it

493
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,520
with an institutional scheme
that limits what can be done.

494
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,350
And so,
uh,

495
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,130
the American system so
called checks and balances,

496
00:36:05,131 --> 00:36:08,850
which you also learned about
in high school civics courses,

497
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:14,220
structures, the constitutional
system that they created.

498
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,593
And it is,

499
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,030
this is something that you can tell
from the passage from Tocqueville that I

500
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:21,864
read you,

501
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:26,930
that Tocqueville didn't fully understand
or appreciate because he thought that

502
00:36:27,031 --> 00:36:32,031
every branch of the government
was ultimately controlled
by the majority and the

503
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:37,920
designers of the constitution
intended rather, um,

504
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:43,190
to have them at least controlled in
different ways by majority opinion.

505
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:49,040
But more importantly to set up a scheme
in which they would control one another.

506
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,500
Ambition would be made
to counteract ambition.

507
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:01,200
And so you would you, we've all
been reading in the newspapers, uh,

508
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:04,170
this weekend at the moment
of their retirement of,

509
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,490
of Justice John Paul
Stevens, uh, that he was,

510
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,860
he was one of the people,
for instance,

511
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:15,720
who checked the expansion of
executive power I after nine 11.

512
00:37:15,721 --> 00:37:20,721
And the harm done case by saying it
was unconstitutional to use military

513
00:37:21,301 --> 00:37:24,810
tribunals to try,
uh,

514
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,430
the Guantanamo Bay

515
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:33,810
detainees
from the point of view of Madison.

516
00:37:33,811 --> 00:37:37,320
This specific issue is
not what's important here,

517
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:41,010
but rather that what we saw after nine 11,

518
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:44,640
which is a big expansion
of executive power.

519
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,620
Okay.

520
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,453
Right.

521
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:52,730
And then you see an assertion of power
by different branch to say to the

522
00:37:53,281 --> 00:37:55,650
executive, no, you can't do that.

523
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:01,280
And so our limiting of executive power
in this case by the judicial branch,

524
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,630
and so what you have
in the American scheme,

525
00:38:06,631 --> 00:38:11,631
the American constitutional scheme
is a large number of Vito points.

526
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,300
First of all,
we have the bill of rights.

527
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:20,640
The bill of rights was enacted
after the constitution,

528
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,290
but only when undertakings had been made,
uh,

529
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:27,990
than it would be enacted in most of the

530
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:35,100
state legislatures. So it was
basically, even though it came,

531
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:41,130
there was an informal agreement by the
time the constitution was adopted that

532
00:38:41,381 --> 00:38:42,940
they would be a bill of rights.

533
00:38:42,941 --> 00:38:47,941
That what became the first 10 amendments
that would limit the power of the

534
00:38:49,451 --> 00:38:50,440
central government.

535
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:56,370
And so we have a bill of rights and then
we have super majority requirements,

536
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,430
most obviously to change the constitution.
Huge,

537
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:07,180
super majority requirements,
right? To amend the constitution.

538
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:09,160
It's very difficult.

539
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:14,050
You need two thirds in both houses of
Congress and then three quarters of the

540
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:14,884
states.

541
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:19,900
Some of your parents were around at
the last serious effort to amend the

542
00:39:19,901 --> 00:39:23,710
constitution, namely the era,
the equal rights amendment,

543
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,410
which failed to get that,

544
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,260
to pass that threshold very hard.

545
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:33,680
But then we have other super
majority requirements, uh,

546
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,680
the filibuster rule in the Senate,

547
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:40,810
which we may see come into play and
Supreme Court confirmation hearings.

548
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:45,550
That's not in the constitution, but
it's, it's a super majority requirement.

549
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:50,320
Uh, nonetheless that we've embedded
in our institutional scheme.

550
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:55,240
Anytime you add super
majority requirements,

551
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:57,743
okay.

552
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,360
Anytime you add super
majority requirement,

553
00:40:00,361 --> 00:40:05,100
you make it harder for the
current majority to work.

554
00:40:05,101 --> 00:40:10,101
It's well separation of
powers already alluded to,

555
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:14,400
uh,
the court versus the executive,

556
00:40:14,401 --> 00:40:17,460
the legislature versus the executive.

557
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:22,790
The notion that ambition of players in
one branch will counteract the ambition

558
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,720
of plas in a different branch.

559
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,320
Greatly debated subject.
Uh,

560
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:36,410
how effective can the branches really
be to check one another after all,

561
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:43,770
the court does not have
an army at its disposal.

562
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,410
You know,
if the court had,

563
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,863
mmm,

564
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:55,270
you guys are young enough to remember the
2000 election when we had a knife edge

565
00:40:56,211 --> 00:41:01,211
result and partisans on both side was
saying that candidate won and it was being

566
00:41:02,271 --> 00:41:07,271
litigated in various ways through the
state courts in Florida and we didn't have

567
00:41:07,401 --> 00:41:09,350
a clear result.
Um,

568
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:16,030
and finally the Supreme Court in Bush
v Gore ruled in a very controversial

569
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:19,123
decision.

570
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,070
Okay.

571
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,780
That President Bush was the winner.

572
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:28,350
Well then candidate Bush was the winner
and Vice President Gore was the loser

573
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,070
and Gore stood on national

574
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,340
television and he said,
I accept the result.

575
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,650
I don't agree with the result,
but I accept the result.

576
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:44,910
He didn't have to.

577
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:50,860
You could imagine in many
countries at that point,

578
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,300
the Clinton administration would have
sent the tanks down Pennsylvania Avenue.

579
00:41:55,301 --> 00:41:56,920
What would the court have been able to do?

580
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,860
Nothing.
Right?

581
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:06,510
It's far from obvious in
Iraq, right? That the,

582
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:10,430
the loser of the erection is going
to accept the result. So there's,

583
00:42:10,431 --> 00:42:13,190
there's great debate cause the,
the

584
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:20,220
Madison Madison makes heavy weather in
the federalist papers of the proposition

585
00:42:21,941 --> 00:42:26,941
that just writing something on a parchment
doesn't guarantee that people are

586
00:42:27,251 --> 00:42:29,110
gone except what you,
right.

587
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:32,240
Okay.

588
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,890
So what does it really mean to say
that there's separation of powers?

589
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:46,750
Was the court ultimately is dependent
upon people just going along with what it

590
00:42:48,741 --> 00:42:53,360
says? Right. And likewise
with the legislature. Um,

591
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:58,280
yes. You know, they just, there's
this attempt to separate congress.

592
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:04,120
Congress votes in theory only Congress
can declare war and Congress has to fund

593
00:43:06,681 --> 00:43:08,450
the military.
Um,

594
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:13,660
but in practice it's very difficult for
Congress to resist what the executive

595
00:43:15,231 --> 00:43:17,930
branch wants to do on
the all of those things.

596
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:22,940
And when we look at cases
where the court faces down,

597
00:43:22,941 --> 00:43:26,180
even either the legislature
or the executive branch,

598
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:31,810
it's usually only in cases where what
they're doing is very popular when they're

599
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:38,150
doing, you know, when they telling
Nixon to turn over the tapes,

600
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:43,640
1974, 1973 74, uh,

601
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:47,540
it's unanimous cord and
it's a popular action.

602
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:49,250
Um,

603
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:53,630
if Nixon had been at 95% in
the opinion polls at that time,

604
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:59,260
it's less clear that the court would have
faced down the executive branch or at

605
00:43:59,391 --> 00:44:01,400
least so some scholars claim.

606
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:06,980
So how much you really get
separation of powers is,

607
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,040
is a subject that's greatly debated by
political scientists because at the end

608
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,950
of the day,
despite what Madison says,

609
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:22,360
separation of powers is just something
written on a parchment as Dall puts it in

610
00:44:23,931 --> 00:44:28,931
his critique of Madison in the preface
to democratic theory is most important

611
00:44:29,061 --> 00:44:32,220
book,
which was published in 1956

612
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,830
and it's still in print.

613
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,600
Very few of us can say we wrote a book,
uh,

614
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:43,980
50 years ago that's still in print,
but there it is, it is still in print.

615
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:48,630
Um, the all says, the
problem with this famous,

616
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:54,410
this famous one liner of Madison's is
that there's actually no real mechanism to

617
00:44:57,601 --> 00:45:01,890
ensure that ambition will
counteract ambition. And it's rare.

618
00:45:01,891 --> 00:45:06,891
That is simply that
people accept this scheme.

619
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:11,280
But what if they didn't?
What if in 1800,

620
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:14,610
that had not been a turnover of power?

621
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:17,070
We had a knife Angela section in 1800.

622
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,553
MMM

623
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:22,940
maybe that would have made America

624
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:24,703
mmm.

625
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:29,910
Much more prone to the, the
seizure of power by, um,

626
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:34,710
those who currently controlled the levers
of power, the military on. So we didn't,

627
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,553
we had it,

628
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:40,860
the loser gave up in 1800 and we began
to create this culture of democratic

629
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,120
trends,
turnovers where the,

630
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:47,170
the government loses an
election and gives up power.

631
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,580
Very unusual thing,
but it happens.

632
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:54,940
So separation of powers,

633
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:59,860
much debated, and I'm going
to come back to this, um,

634
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:04,960
much debated as to how effective
and important it really is.

635
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,920
More veto points.
We have bicameralism as you know,

636
00:46:10,921 --> 00:46:12,720
from reading the federalist papers,

637
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:18,080
the founders were mostly worried about
the power of Congress because it seemed

638
00:46:18,181 --> 00:46:23,181
like it was going to be the most powerful
branch if the executive was weak and

639
00:46:23,611 --> 00:46:26,370
designed to be weaker,
much weaker than it is today.

640
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:29,460
And so they thought the
thing to do is to divide.

641
00:46:29,461 --> 00:46:34,461
Congress have a by camera
system and legislation has
to be passed in both houses

642
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,080
and have them elected by different rules.
So we have,

643
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:45,810
um, Senate seats elected
at large in the states,

644
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:50,520
whereas we have small congressional
districts and therefore we have very

645
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:55,521
different incentives that the politicians
are going to react to very different

646
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,880
factions overlapping with one another,
uh,

647
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:04,830
in different ways to get back
to the basic pluralist ideal.

648
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:11,600
And then finally of course last but by
no means least in terms of veto points,

649
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,573
federalism,

650
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:19,440
federalism is in another source of

651
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:21,913
yeah.

652
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,950
Vito points in what can actually happen.

653
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,970
Thank in your,
in the last few years of

654
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:37,370
debates about gay marriage,
you know,

655
00:47:37,371 --> 00:47:39,740
we have marital law is State Law.

656
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,340
MMM.

657
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,740
And for a long time there has been,

658
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:44,560
okay.

659
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,100
A federal law which says if
you get married in one state,

660
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:51,520
the marriage will be recognized
and in every other state.

661
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:56,650
So if people move and then later
on they get divorced to one dies.

662
00:47:56,651 --> 00:48:01,651
It doesn't matter what state you were in
for the purposes of the divorce or full

663
00:48:01,811 --> 00:48:05,560
probate law,
you are still going to be governed by it.

664
00:48:05,561 --> 00:48:09,910
Just a sort of utilitarian
efficiency thing. Yeah.

665
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:13,630
Every state can have
differences in it's marital law.

666
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:18,930
But California has got a recognized
Connecticut's marriages as valid.

667
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:24,900
Then along comes a socially
divisive issue like gay marriage.

668
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:26,910
Okay.

669
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:29,550
And unsurprisingly,
some states,

670
00:48:29,551 --> 00:48:32,160
one to enact gay marriage and some don't.

671
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,720
But then this federal requirement that
all states recognize one another's

672
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:44,250
marriages suddenly becomes
ideologically charged, right?

673
00:48:44,251 --> 00:48:48,870
Whereas it was presented as just
a utilitarian, efficient thing.

674
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:54,080
Now it becomes ideologically charged
because if the state of Massachusetts

675
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:57,120
recognizes gay marriage,

676
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:02,450
then in implicitly means that the state
of Georgia has to recognize it as well.

677
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:07,380
So you'd get an upsurge
of political activism.

678
00:49:07,381 --> 00:49:12,381
And finally the defense of Marriage Act
in Congress to preserve the rights of

679
00:49:13,861 --> 00:49:18,370
the states
to reject or accept,

680
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,083
mmm.

681
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,400
Gay Marriage.

682
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:26,960
And so that's an example of the
veto power of states in play,

683
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,050
uh, that, that, uh,

684
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:32,900
rears its head in a setting like that.

685
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:38,620
And so what you have in
the U S is not a democracy,

686
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,570
certainly not a pure democracy.

687
00:49:41,571 --> 00:49:46,571
You rather have what they design was
what they referred to as a non tyrannical

688
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:52,040
republic. They thought that
that was the best they could do.

689
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,400
They had misgivings about a lot of it,

690
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,160
but they thought that
this was the only way.

691
00:49:59,030 --> 00:49:59,540
Okay.

692
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:04,160
They could create the Union
and head off civil war.

693
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:07,910
Of course, they did set off
set. We had civil war. Anyway,

694
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,030
a subject I'll come back to on Wednesday,

695
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:16,450
but we created this hybrid between a
what and and non tyrannical republic,

696
00:50:17,841 --> 00:50:18,560
if you like,

697
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:23,560
and democratic system and many of our
arguments about contemporary democracy are

698
00:50:26,961 --> 00:50:31,961
really arguments about how much we should
preserve this hybrid and how much we

699
00:50:32,301 --> 00:50:35,090
should have a thoroughgoing
democratic system.

700
00:50:35,091 --> 00:50:37,730
And I'll take that up on Wednesday.
