1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:07,750
So a one way you can think
about comparisons between
Marxism and the utilitarian

2
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:14,451
tradition is that both have a
micro story and a macro story.

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,480
So when you think about
the utilitarian tradition,

4
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:23,070
we have the micro story of the
parade Oh principle and how in one,

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,960
each individual transaction,
uh,

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,980
we'll go and then we have a macro story
that if you allow people to transact

7
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:36,090
freely, you get the most efficient
utilitarian result of a time.

8
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:40,980
And so you get the rights utility
synthesis at least in the aspiration.

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,380
And other way of putting that is what
Adam Smith famously referred to as an

10
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:52,011
invisible hand theory that while no
individual participant is interested in

11
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:56,160
generating an efficient aggregate outcome,

12
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,290
indeed each individual participant
is just trying to get on his hind

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,180
indifference curve as possible.

14
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:08,450
The biproduct of their collective
individually selfish actions is this

15
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:12,360
beneficent, um, overall results.

16
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,560
And so that's the invisible hand of the
market that Smith talks about in the

17
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:18,180
wealth of nations.

18
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,810
Marks two has a micro story and macro
story and an invisible hand theory.

19
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:29,310
And that's why we're going
to spend today's lecture.
And next Monday's lecture.

20
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,560
Talking about today, principally, we're
going to focus on his micro story, uh,

21
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:35,010
his,

22
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:40,010
his story of how wealth gets created
at the micro level under capitalism.

23
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,960
And then we will link it,
um,

24
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,740
on Monday to his macro story.

25
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,320
And he to you will see,

26
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,350
has an invisible hand theory that is to
say the particular players at the micro

27
00:01:55,231 --> 00:02:00,180
level confront incentives to
behave in certain ways. Um,

28
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,560
and the byproduct of their actions is,
is a macro result,

29
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,060
which nobody understands
or intense the differences.

30
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,890
We'll see that for Marx,

31
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,550
the invisible hand isn't
entirely benevolent.

32
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,430
It's Bella benevolent for a while,

33
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,650
but then it starts to become malevolent
over time because of the way that the

34
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:25,770
dynamics of capitalism
play themselves out.

35
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,370
So that's the sort of where
we're headed in the medium term.

36
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,610
In the next couple of lectures I want
though before heading into the micro story

37
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,990
to make a couple of conceptual points.
Um,

38
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,270
remember that when we
look at enlightenment,

39
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:47,271
thinkers were concerned first and
foremost with the fact that they are all

40
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:52,401
motivated by the idea of individual
freedom as the highest good and basing

41
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:57,570
politics on scientific principles.
Um,

42
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,720
rather than appeals to or natural law or
religion or tradition or anything else.

43
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,930
And I just want to highlight what Marx is,

44
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,540
assumptions about those two things are,

45
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,400
I've actually mentioned these in
one way or another in, in, uh,

46
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,370
last Monday's lecture.
But just to emphasize,

47
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,540
first of all,

48
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,780
the idea of freedom in Marx is captured
beautifully in this very famous passage,

49
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,670
um, that he wrote Ashley to
relatively young marks his,

50
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,700
his critique of The Hague aliens,
um,

51
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:39,430
in the and their followers Feuerbach
in a work called the German ideology.

52
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,980
He has this,
um,

53
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,370
very vivid description of what he means
by unfreedom the antithesis of he's his

54
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:52,660
ideal. He says the division of Labor,
which we talked about last time,

55
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,150
offers us the first example.

56
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,660
As long as man remains in natural society,

57
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,130
that is as long as a cleavage exists
between the particular and the common

58
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:07,390
interests as long. Therefore,
as activity is not voluntary,

59
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:11,560
not naturally divided.
Man's own deed becomes an alien.

60
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:16,390
Nepal are opposed to him which enslaves
him instead of being controlled by him.

61
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,990
For as soon as the division
of labor comes into being,

62
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:25,290
each man has a particular exclusive
sphere of activity which is forced,

63
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:28,610
done. Write this down. I'll put the slides
up. You can get them on the Internet.

64
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,840
So as soon as the division
of labor comes into being,

65
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:37,170
each ma ma man has a particular exclusive
sphere of activity which is forced

66
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:41,920
upon him and which he cannot
escape. He is a hunter, a fisherman,

67
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:45,760
a shepherd,
or a critical critic and he must remain.

68
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:50,761
So if he does not want to lose his
means of livelihood while in a communist

69
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:51,671
society,

70
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:56,671
this is his utopian ideal when nobody
has one exclusive sphere of activity,

71
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,480
but each can become a comp
accomplished in any branch.

72
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:06,481
He wishes society regulates the general
production and makes it possible for me

73
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:10,960
to do one thing today and
another tomorrow. This is baby,

74
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:14,590
the most famous line in all of
marks to hunt in the morning,

75
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,270
fish in the afternoon,

76
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,360
rear cattle in the evening and criticize
the after Dina just as I have a mind

77
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,810
without ever becoming a hunter,
a fisherman, a shepherd,

78
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,100
or a critic.

79
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,210
So this is a utopian marks,

80
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,470
this idea that as soon as
you have a division of labor,

81
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,910
we are no longer free.

82
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:41,770
We're in slave to our particular
place in the division of Labor.

83
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,050
Remember what I read to you from Adam
Smith's description of the pin factory.

84
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,180
You know, somebody spends their whole
life stretching that wire for the pin.

85
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,680
Somebody spends their whole life putting
the heads on the pin that that's a

86
00:05:56,681 --> 00:06:01,681
sense which marks wants to say we're
alienated from our true selves once the

87
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:03,680
division of Labor sets in.

88
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:09,370
And we can only return to being a
fully rounded human beings at one with,

89
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,590
with ourselves when the,

90
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,130
when the division of Labor
ultimately is abolished.

91
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,610
And a precondition for that is the super
abundance of wealth that capitalism is

92
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,080
cat capitalism is historically
destined to create.

93
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,120
Um, and how we will finally
get there is the story.

94
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:37,150
Marx believed of how his macro
theory would play out over time.

95
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,740
And we will only reach a communist
society where people can be genuinely free

96
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:48,010
once the need for a division of Labor
has been obviated by the existence of a

97
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:53,480
superabundance of wealth.
So all of that's coming.

98
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:58,481
But this is just to underscore that is
basic ideal is freedom and not equality.

99
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:05,450
And his argument is going to be,
as I said to you last time,

100
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,780
that the condition for the
free development of each
is the free development of

101
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,370
all second,

102
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:18,610
just to come back to his and
underscore his theory of science.

103
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,560
Mark's is an objectivist.

104
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,320
He believes that there are um,

105
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,840
forces operating in history,

106
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,110
which he calls the materialist
conception of history,

107
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,070
which shape the way history on faults.

108
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:38,810
History has a direction.

109
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,740
It's moving through a variety of phases.

110
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,490
Each of which has internal contradictions.

111
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:52,090
And the way they play themselves out
is going to determine what happens.

112
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,050
So that tension in a feudal
society between the feudal,

113
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,500
between the peasants and the Lords is
gonna determine the way in which conflict

114
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:06,740
in that society, um, occurs.

115
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,220
Then you'll get the emergence of a
bourgeois class and they will create

116
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:11,120
capitalism.

117
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,960
But that will bring in bringing forth
a working class who will get into

118
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:18,380
conflicts with them.
And as those conflicts play out,

119
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:21,530
you'll eventually get
communism and socialism.

120
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,820
It's a reductionist theory.
As I said to you before,

121
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:29,810
think of Bill Clinton's line.
It's the economy stupid.

122
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,090
Most of what happens if not all of what
happens that's of any importance in

123
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:39,260
politics is determined
by economic interests.

124
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,660
Whether people understand this or not
or agree with it or not is beside the

125
00:08:44,661 --> 00:08:45,494
point.

126
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,860
And that brings us to a third element
of this Marxian science that I just want

127
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:57,330
to underscore which will be
relevant for today's lecture,

128
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,660
is that Marx makes a distinction between
a class in itself and a class for

129
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:07,320
itself. And I want to spend
a couple of minutes on.

130
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,920
First is definition of class and then
this in itself for itself distinction.

131
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:19,650
A lot of people say that
Mark's is auntie individual.

132
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,850
He's not individualist because he thinks
about things in terms of classes and

133
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:25,320
clos conflict.

134
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,190
That is a very superficial
reading of Marx as um,

135
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,320
a very eminent scholar called Yawn.

136
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,880
Alster has pointed out in many books
that he's written on the subject.

137
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:44,150
Actually marks is an individualist
because if you look at how he defines

138
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:45,300
classes,

139
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,220
he defines them by reference to
the way in which the, the, the,

140
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,020
the way in which individuals
relate to the means of production.

141
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,550
So what is it that makes you work in
class as opposed to a member of the

142
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,690
capitalist laws?

143
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:06,230
What makes you working cause is if you
have to sell your labor power to somebody

144
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:07,530
else in order to live.

145
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,730
So if you want to know where the
somebody is working class, you say,

146
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,850
does he have to sell his labor power to
somebody else in order to live or not?

147
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,680
If the answer is yes, he's
working class, the answer is no,

148
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,600
he's not working class.
So you might say,

149
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,130
hmm, well I have, you know,

150
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:35,131
I ha I have to come in here and work
every day to get paid my salary.

151
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:39,930
I have to sell my labor to
the university in that sense,

152
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,150
but I don't, I'm not working class
you. You might think, you know,

153
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:48,780
somebody else might tell me I'm working
plus, but they can speak for themselves.

154
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:52,440
You know, I, I drive a nice
car. I live in the suburbs,

155
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,910
I'm not working class. Um, Mark's,

156
00:10:56,911 --> 00:11:01,911
his answer is to appeal
to this distinction being
between a class in itself and

157
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:06,390
a class for itself.
The answer is Shapiro.

158
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:10,090
You had just diluted,
you might think you are not working class.

159
00:11:10,091 --> 00:11:15,091
But that's because you don't understand
your objective position in the division

160
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,193
of Labor.

161
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,640
You are working class whether
you understand it or not.

162
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,720
And that's a class I'm working class in
a class in itself since I'm not working

163
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:32,571
class in the class for itself if I
don't believe that I'm working class.

164
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,620
So the in itself

165
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,120
represents the objective division
definition of plus the four itself is the

166
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:43,320
subjective okay.

167
00:11:43,321 --> 00:11:48,150
Where the people actually believe that
working class and perceive themselves to

168
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:52,200
be working class. But what
matters for the, for the uh,

169
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,350
movement of history is the
in itself what's ultimately
going to drive everything

170
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,290
is the logic, the object of
logic, of class conflict,

171
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:07,470
not the subjective logic of what people
think is their position in the social

172
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,210
division of Labor. So, um,

173
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:18,160
it's important to keep those two things
separate. Now marks, as I've already said,

174
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:23,161
was a utopian thinker and
he does ultimately want to
say for reasons that that

175
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:28,510
I'll get into later today and
more and more depth on Monday.

176
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,720
He does ultimately want to say that what
differentiates a communist revolution

177
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:39,510
from all previous revolutions is that
these two things will become synonymous.

178
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,090
That for the first time in history,

179
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,310
the working class in four itself,

180
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,150
we'll come to see it self as
the working class in itself.

181
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,180
We will understand our objective position
in the division of labor and self

182
00:12:58,091 --> 00:13:00,700
consciously create the new order.

183
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,460
Whereas in all previous
modes of production,

184
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,610
people don't really understand
their position and the
object of scheme of things

185
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,520
and so they create orders
as invisible hands.

186
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:14,410
To go back to Adam Smith's term,

187
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,640
they create orders as byproducts
of their intended activities,

188
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:23,800
not as products of their
intentional design.

189
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:29,020
And so that's, that's that distinction
between in itself and for itself.

190
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,860
Now you might listen to all of
this and you could say, wow,

191
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,240
yeah,

192
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,390
it's a kind of quaint 19th century idea,

193
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:43,630
but it doesn't have much to do with the
white people live in the world today.

194
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,500
After all,

195
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:50,501
as we have all noticed with
great intensity and the
past year and a half of the

196
00:13:51,381 --> 00:13:52,550
financial crisis.

197
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:57,050
Many people who work for wages

198
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,310
yeah

199
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,220
also have money in the stock market.
Well,

200
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:06,630
but then they're capitalists aren't they?
Because stock is capital.

201
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,770
So you know,

202
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:13,770
I have my retirement money and my Tia
Cref has college professors get it in the

203
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:18,880
stock market. So I'm an owner
of capital as well as a worker.

204
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,840
And this sort of,
um,

205
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,450
binary distinction between the working
class and the capitalist class. Just it,

206
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:31,450
it just too simple minded.
What do you think Marx would say to that?

207
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,920
Anybody?
Any takers?

208
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:43,640
I'm not really working class because you
know, I've got, I've got money and I,

209
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:48,440
you know, I have stocks and
vested in all kinds of things.

210
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,110
Mutual funds,
no.

211
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,820
So I'm not really working for us any,

212
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,620
anyone think what marks might
say to that? Not, not easy.

213
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,180
I think that what he would
say is this, he'd say, well,

214
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,720
the definition of working class is that
you have to work for somebody else in

215
00:15:09,971 --> 00:15:14,830
order to live. Not that you choose to
work for somebody else in order to lab.

216
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,160
So if I have enough money in my Tia craf
invested in the stock market that I can

217
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:25,600
quit tomorrow and do just fine,
then I'm not working class.

218
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,010
So it's, it's this element of
compulsion that makes you working five.

219
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,810
So it doesn't,

220
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:36,930
it's not important from Marxists point
of view that some of us might own stocks,

221
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,870
but if we really owned
enough stock that we would,

222
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:46,060
if we were not in this position of having
to work for somebody else in order to

223
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:48,970
live,
we wouldn't be working class.

224
00:15:48,971 --> 00:15:53,200
And so people could move in and
out of the working class. Indeed.

225
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:58,201
I know people on the Yale Faculty who
two years ago we're about to retire and

226
00:15:58,961 --> 00:16:03,961
live off their accumulated Tia craf
and then it went up in smoke when,

227
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:07,810
uh, when the wheels came off the
economy and now they're not retiring.

228
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,430
So what Marx would say,

229
00:16:09,431 --> 00:16:13,600
where's while they managed to get
out of the working class in theory in

230
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:18,160
principle, but then they fell back
down into the working class. So it's,

231
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,260
it's this element of compulsion.

232
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:24,640
They're not retiring because they don't
have enough and therefore they have to

233
00:16:24,641 --> 00:16:27,610
work for somebody else in order to live.

234
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:32,611
So that's the distinction between a
class in itself and a class for itself

235
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:38,800
that drives his theory.
Okay. So what is the theory?

236
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:43,883
Okay,

237
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,960
we're back to lock those of you who
read chapter five of the second treaties

238
00:16:51,591 --> 00:16:52,250
carefully.

239
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:57,250
When we looked at Locke and his
theory of property saw how for Locke,

240
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:03,340
the workmanship ideal plays out in the
economic realm with the proposition that

241
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,930
most of the value of our
product comes from work.

242
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,950
Very crude in lock. At one
point he says, you know,

243
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:17,420
90% of it comes from work.
The rest is natural resources.

244
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,230
At another point he says
99% of it comes from work.

245
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,740
The rest is natural resources.
Um,

246
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,980
but he locked doesn't really have any
mechanism by which labor supposedly

247
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:33,620
creates value.
And in the 17th and 18th century,

248
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:37,370
there were really three theories
floating around. There were,

249
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:42,170
as I think I mentioned to you on
Monday, there were in, in Europe,

250
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,250
particularly France, the physiocrats
who said value comes from the land,

251
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,100
but there were English theorist
who looked at them and said, no,

252
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:54,660
that can't be right because look how rich
hollandaise and they don't have a lot

253
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:57,930
of land.
And so they thought value came from trade.

254
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:02,780
But then the third group starting
in the 17th century with Hobbes,

255
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,370
so William Petty Locke and others said,

256
00:18:05,371 --> 00:18:08,070
no value comes from work.

257
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,160
That source of value is work.

258
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And that's what Mark's picks up on in
trying to develop a theory of value.

259
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,420
And his theory is more refined than locks,

260
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:29,350
more fine than smiths and
more refined than Ricardo's.

261
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:34,710
It starts with this idea of socially
necessary labor time or smelled,

262
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:42,210
and he'd defines smelt as the labor
time required to produce any use value.

263
00:18:43,091 --> 00:18:46,600
Remember what anyone remind us,
what is a use value?

264
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,120
Monday's lecture. What's a yes? Yes.

265
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,760
Is it useful? Right? So anything
with utility is a use value,

266
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:02,803
right?

267
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,840
So it's the amount of labor time required
to produce any use value under the

268
00:19:08,331 --> 00:19:09,860
conditions of production.

269
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:15,310
Normal for a given society and with the
average degree of skill and intensity of

270
00:19:15,861 --> 00:19:18,230
the labor prevalent in the society.

271
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,070
So let's suppose

272
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,190
lay on it and I are making typewriters.

273
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:29,950
Yeah.

274
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,210
One of the big sort of conundrums
of labor theories of value had been,

275
00:19:34,211 --> 00:19:35,044
well what if,

276
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:40,410
what if Lillian is a perfectionist
and he spends twice as long making his

277
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:43,780
typewriter as I spend
making my typewriter.

278
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,540
But

279
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:46,871
you know,

280
00:19:46,871 --> 00:19:50,470
most of the perfectionisms action his
own head because at the end of the day

281
00:19:50,471 --> 00:19:51,304
they're the same.

282
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:53,923
MMM.

283
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,970
Marx would say he wouldn't,

284
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
he would not say lay on his typewriter
was worth twice Shapiro's type by it

285
00:20:02,571 --> 00:20:05,700
because he put twice as
much labor into it. No,

286
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:11,190
because half of his Labor
would be socially unnecessary.

287
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,270
So it's,

288
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:17,270
it's socially necessary labor time or
if a new labor saving device was created

289
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,040
so that the keys could be
made much more quickly,

290
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,500
then we are laborious doing it with
file and I use the new machine,

291
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,800
the labor saving device
and lay on it doesn't.

292
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,650
So my type artists get
produced more quickly.

293
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:40,430
His type art not going to sell for
more than my typewriter because again,

294
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:44,370
he's using socially unnecessary labor.

295
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,130
So that's the notion of the
average degree of skill,

296
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:52,030
intensity of labor prevalent
in the society at the time. So,

297
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,893
um,

298
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:59,290
that's what's going to determine the
value of commodities. The long term,

299
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,010
remember we talked about the,
the natural value,

300
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:08,011
the long term equilibrium price of a
commodity is going to be determined by the

301
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:14,110
amount of labor power that is
socially necessary to produce it.

302
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,440
And this idea of socially
necessary includes everybody
working at the same or an

303
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:22,030
average intensity.

304
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:27,031
And it includes using available
technologies because if
some use them and others

305
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:31,060
don't,
those who don't are going to be um,

306
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,770
deploying unnecessary labor time.

307
00:21:34,771 --> 00:21:39,420
And that's not going to be reflected in
the value of the product because in a

308
00:21:39,421 --> 00:21:40,740
competitive market,

309
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,900
the most cheaply priced
commodity is going to beat.

310
00:21:45,901 --> 00:21:48,180
The other sound important to remember,

311
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:51,810
Mark's works for the model of a
perfectly competitive economy,

312
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,170
okay?

313
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,710
Right? In which equivalence exchange
for equivalent, no cheating.

314
00:21:56,711 --> 00:22:00,160
I mentioned that on
Monday, okay. A perfectly,

315
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:04,060
his model is a perfectly competitive
economy. At least at the beginning.

316
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:09,090
He's got a view about how economies evolve
over time to become uncompetitive and

317
00:22:10,181 --> 00:22:12,460
we'll get to that.
But initially,

318
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:16,060
and then his analytic story
in a competitive economy,

319
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:20,290
the most cheaply produced products are
going to drive out the last cheaply

320
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:24,430
produced.
And so it's socially necessary labor time,

321
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:29,350
not average, not actual.
Doesn't matter how much blood,

322
00:22:29,351 --> 00:22:33,030
sweat and tears Leon aid actually uses.
Um,

323
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,790
what counts is how much he knew
he, she needs to use. Okay?

324
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,730
So that you could say, okay, but,

325
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:44,440
but that's not the beginning
of the whole story.

326
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,890
And to get into that,

327
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:53,010
we have to go a step further with marks
and look not just at the labor theory of

328
00:22:53,591 --> 00:22:58,090
value,
but the labor theory of surplus value.

329
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,000
This is where the rubber
meets the road for marks.

330
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,090
What he wants to say is

331
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,190
living human labor power

332
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:14,340
is the only source of fresh value.
I've exchanged value.

333
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:19,620
So this is the workmanship,
IDL on crack. Okay.

334
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:24,000
Living Human Labor power is
the only source of fresh value.

335
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:32,360
So when Locke said, you
know, work is 90%, uh,

336
00:23:32,361 --> 00:23:36,950
or maybe it's 99% of the value of
commodities and the rest commerce from the

337
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:38,830
common locks,
um,

338
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:44,010
Mark's just going to say it's
100% all exchange value comes work

339
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,860
and why he's thinking of here,

340
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:02,170
it's two things.
One is he wants to say,

341
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,670
if you, if you look at all the
commodities that are produced in an,

342
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,080
in a market economy,

343
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,910
the one thing they all have in common
is that that products of human work.

344
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:16,863
Yeah.

345
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:21,860
It's the,
it's the single common denominator,

346
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,353
right?

347
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,813
Yeah.

348
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:33,210
It is. The capacity to work
is a commodity like any other,

349
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:41,380
so that we'll, we'll get into
this in more detail in a minute.

350
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,730
But when you think about what
it is that people are paid,

351
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,270
what is it that a worker is paid?

352
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:55,050
It's determined like the
value of any other commodity.

353
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:59,160
So when we say what is
the value of a buck,

354
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:04,410
it's determined by the amount of labor
power necessary to produce that book.

355
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,280
And when we say what is
the value of a steelworker,

356
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:12,150
it's determined by the amount of
labor power necessary to produce that

357
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:15,150
steelworker.
The workers are commodity and justice.

358
00:25:15,151 --> 00:25:17,490
Same sense as the book is a commodity.

359
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,890
So wages are determined by the
costs of producing the worker.

360
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,350
And

361
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,650
the reason a physicist gets paid more
than a manual labor, then it's simple.

362
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,140
It costs more to produce the physicist,

363
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,900
then it could cost to
produce the manual labor.

364
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,760
All the training and education and so
on that goes into their physicists costs

365
00:25:43,761 --> 00:25:48,650
more than the training and education
that goes into the producing a manual

366
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,301
labor.

367
00:25:49,301 --> 00:25:54,301
So wages are not explained by the
value of what the workup produces.

368
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,230
This is one of the things
people often get wrong.

369
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:01,520
Values I explained by the
cost of producing the worker.

370
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,890
I'll say that again.
It's important.

371
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:10,220
Wager is wages are explained not by
the value of what the workup produces,

372
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,160
but rare that by the cost
of producing the worker.

373
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,970
So why do you think of that?

374
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,550
Why would somebody say

375
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:32,650
somebody who thought this is,
what would mark say about,

376
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,520
why is that Michelangelo
Painting Worth so much?

377
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,590
Well, why does it, why does
a professional baseball get

378
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:49,230
tens of millions, maybe hundreds of
millions of dollars if this is true?

379
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:54,800
Anyone think about,
I think of what Marx would say.

380
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,613
Okay.

381
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,430
Anyone want to guess?

382
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,753
Okay.

383
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,910
Yeah.
What do you say?

384
00:27:07,911 --> 00:27:11,510
It's because like how much time they
had to practice and how much, uh,

385
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,620
like money and time they put
into learning their skills.

386
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,740
That would be part of
it. But still, you know,

387
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,750
I mean there are only
so many hours in a day.

388
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:25,550
How do you get up to $100 million salary?
Uh,

389
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:32,050
it's, it's uh, I mean,
you're on the right track.

390
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:37,720
Any, what else goes into the creation
of a major league baseball player?

391
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:42,130
Why don't they have very good major
league baseball players and Brit,

392
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,343
okay,

393
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,250
it's,
they don't have minor leagues.

394
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:52,260
They don't have farm teams that there's
huge costs associated with getting the

395
00:27:52,361 --> 00:27:55,910
one brilliant best of all time player.

396
00:27:55,911 --> 00:27:59,680
So that's what he would have to say.
Or if you think about the value,

397
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:02,200
the value of a Michelangelo painting,

398
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,140
it's not just the
training of Michelangelo,

399
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:10,290
it's all those failed painters that
all those popes wasted all that money

400
00:28:10,391 --> 00:28:11,230
investing in.

401
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,440
But that all goes in in some
indirect sense into the,

402
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,483
um,

403
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,510
into the wage differential.
So that's sort of what it's of course,

404
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,610
if it is a stretch.

405
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:30,660
And one thing that marks
did not think about, mmm,

406
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,860
was what we call in in economics today,

407
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,570
winner take all markets. Anyone know
what a winner take all market is?

408
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,650
Once a winner take all market,

409
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,440
what is, what does the
phrase suggest to you? What,

410
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,720
what do you think a winner
take all market should be?

411
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,710
Think about the wage differential between
the major leagues and Minor League

412
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:14,490
Baseball is huge, right? That's
a winner take all market.

413
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,090
The way you can think about it is,
um,

414
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:24,350
before the advent of the gramophone
record being a really pretty good opera

415
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:30,690
singer could, um,

416
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:36,240
you could have, you'd do pretty
well. Every major city would have,

417
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:39,690
you know, an opera with a pretty good
opera singer. I'd make a good living.

418
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:44,920
Why don't you have the gramophone record?
Then everybody can buy Pavarotti,

419
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,993
right?

420
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:51,030
So then whether or not the
d the difference between
Pavarotti and the next best

421
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:55,390
and third best opera singer,
um,

422
00:29:55,420 --> 00:30:00,070
becomes much more important. So that's
the idea of a winner take all market. Um,

423
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,040
and,
and Mark's had nothing to say about them,

424
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:07,450
so he would have to reach for this
rather contorted logic of saying it.

425
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,210
It just costs much more to produce,
um,

426
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,650
the best baseball player in the world.
Um,

427
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:19,970
because you have to run everything that
goes into that production, not his own,

428
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:25,030
not only his own practicing and training,
but everything that goes with it.

429
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,560
So that's the first point.

430
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:30,730
Labor power is a commodity
and it's exchange value,

431
00:30:30,731 --> 00:30:34,540
which price is determined by
what it costs to produce it.

432
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,170
But then this is the magic.

433
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:42,640
This is the workmanship ideal on crack.
This is the idea.

434
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:45,400
He wants to say that

435
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:52,170
living human labor power is
a unique commodity in that
it's consumption as a use

436
00:30:53,741 --> 00:30:57,730
value leads to the creation of fresh
exchange value. What does this mean?

437
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:03,340
It means that suppose I have some money

438
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,810
and I spend,
you know,

439
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,580
$1,000 on a wonderful meal,
good wine,

440
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,593
okay.

441
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,080
At the end of that meal, you
know I, it's gone, right?

442
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:25,110
The thought I paid the check
and it's gone, I've consumed it.

443
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:32,330
Whereas if I had spent that
thousand dollars hiring one
of you to paint one wall

444
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,920
in my home,

445
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,380
when it's done,

446
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:43,670
my home's worth something more
because it has freshly painted wall.

447
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,860
That's what he means.
Okay?

448
00:31:47,861 --> 00:31:52,861
So that living human labor power differs
from other commodities in that W it's

449
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:57,640
consumption as a use value leads to
the creation of fresh exchange value,

450
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,160
right? You eat the meal, it's gone,

451
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,870
but you consume the labor power of the
person painting your house or the person

452
00:32:04,871 --> 00:32:07,930
working in your factory and it's not gone

453
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,060
right in it.

454
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,070
I mean the labor power gone in
the sense that it's been expanded,

455
00:32:16,071 --> 00:32:20,510
those calories have been spent,
but you have something in a greater value.

456
00:32:20,511 --> 00:32:25,280
I have a house that's worth more than
it was before you hired that person to

457
00:32:25,281 --> 00:32:29,480
paint it.
And that's what makes Labor power unique,

458
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,310
right?
And it is.

459
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:36,490
He wants to say it is the
only source of fresh value.

460
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,673
Okay.

461
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,990
So a couple of just terms here to
get straight his archaic language,

462
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,620
you probably read,

463
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,520
he makes a distinction between what
he calls constant capital and variable

464
00:32:53,521 --> 00:32:54,354
capital,

465
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:59,160
all of that or what oil you
need to think about. There is,

466
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,110
um, capital is what the capitalist
spends in the productive process.

467
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:08,870
Variable capital is wages
and constant capitalist.

468
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:12,720
Everything else,
sometimes he uses these symbols.

469
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:16,500
C means all capital.
Big C means all capital.

470
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:21,950
Little c means everything the capitalist
spends on things other than wages and V

471
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:28,160
is spent on wages and why
he might call it variable.

472
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:33,740
So the idea is that wages are
always driven toward subsistence.

473
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,740
This is, uh, an empirical assumption.

474
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:44,540
Mark's makes a few empirical assumptions
of all the empirical assumptions he

475
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:48,260
makes. This is the one that
actually is the most accurate.

476
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:53,600
He wants to say that there are always
some unemployed in capitalist economies

477
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:57,560
and because there are always some
unemployed in capitalist economies,

478
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:02,120
wages will be driven towards subsistence.
Because if you have,

479
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,670
say a union that organizes
and drives up wages,

480
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:12,860
the employer will then go and
hire nonunion workers and say,

481
00:34:12,861 --> 00:34:17,810
well, will you work for me at subs at
something lower than the union wage?

482
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:23,110
And the answer will be yes because the
unemployed worker won't have a choice.

483
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:28,880
Okay, so wages of B will be
driven towards subsistence.

484
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:33,890
Now that puts on the table another
question. Well, what is subsistence?

485
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:35,560
Okay,

486
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,130
what is subsistence?
And and Mark's does say,

487
00:34:39,131 --> 00:34:44,020
well it has a social and historical
element. So that is to say,

488
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,090
you know,
in a society like ours,

489
00:34:46,091 --> 00:34:51,091
the definition of subsistence
might include having enough
money to buy a car in

490
00:34:51,251 --> 00:34:52,720
order to drive to work.

491
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:56,260
Whereas obviously that was not
true in 19th century Britain.

492
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:59,470
So what counts as subsistence changes?

493
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,920
And we will see there
are other features of,

494
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:08,990
of Marx's theory of capitalism which show
that this actually an belt impetus for

495
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:13,500
the what's constant subsistence to go up.

496
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:16,110
But at any given time,

497
00:35:16,111 --> 00:35:21,111
the accepted level of subsistence and
wages will be driven toward that because

498
00:35:21,841 --> 00:35:26,841
of the existence of what he flamboyantly
described as the reserve army of the

499
00:35:27,511 --> 00:35:29,550
unemployed.
Right.

500
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:35,570
That's what keeps wages at subsistence
or close to it in a competitive economy.

501
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,333
Okay.

502
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,633
Yeah.

503
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:46,450
Let's do a little micro transaction.

504
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,540
Suppose there's a working day.
Okay.

505
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:57,400
And suppose the ex the accepted
working days, 10 hours long,

506
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:06,240
mark says, well think about what the
worker is doing. The work as you know,

507
00:36:06,241 --> 00:36:10,200
is producing cotton.
Let's say it doesn't really matter what.

508
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:15,660
And for some portion of that working day,

509
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:21,410
the cotton that is producing
wine eventually sold is
going to cover the cost of

510
00:36:22,231 --> 00:36:23,064
his wages.

511
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:29,170
So the workup produces
cotton all day long. But the,

512
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:34,230
and the capitalist eventually sells the
cotton right and get something for it.

513
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:39,220
And then he's gotta pay.
His worker is wage.

514
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,780
And we're just going to say for
the purposes of this example, the,

515
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:49,020
the work that's done in the first four
hours is going to cover the wage bill.

516
00:36:51,221 --> 00:36:55,180
And the rest is,
is what Marx calls surplus.

517
00:36:55,181 --> 00:36:58,690
So that's the difference between
necessary and surplus labor time.

518
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:03,340
And Mark's has the eye,
do you have a rate of exploitation,

519
00:37:03,341 --> 00:37:06,190
which is the ratio of national,
sorry, day surplus labor time.

520
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:08,620
You could even make an little index.

521
00:37:08,621 --> 00:37:11,470
And so you'd say it's 1.5.

522
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,560
Okay. So this is the capitalists, the,

523
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:19,590
the value that's produced that covers the
wage bell. This is the wreck. Of course,

524
00:37:19,591 --> 00:37:21,600
this is an all profit,
right?

525
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:27,900
Why isn't it profit? Why isn't
all of that profit? Somebody

526
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,100
think about it. You're a capitalist. Yeah.

527
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,200
Cause somebody goes to the actual,

528
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:43,260
I guess building where they're working
or other, um, or even material needed to

529
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:47,890
exactly. The Kappa Sas to buy raw
material. It's to do advertising,

530
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,870
has to run as to have a
system of managers, um,

531
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:56,610
uh, you know, research and development.
All of that has to be paid out of this.

532
00:37:56,611 --> 00:38:01,500
So profit is, you know, some subset of
this, but it's not all of this. Okay.

533
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,190
So,
okay,

534
00:38:05,191 --> 00:38:08,940
so we're in the cotton business
and it's a competitive business.

535
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:14,510
And so another cotton manufacturer says,

536
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:19,430
you know what?
I think these work is a slacking.

537
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,030
I'm an essay from now on to my workers.
You work 11 hours.

538
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,250
Yeah,

539
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:30,210
wages are ready at subsistence
by assumption, right?

540
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,070
So you know,
the workers might no or not,

541
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:40,450
and they say it can say goodbye, I'll
get somebody's unemployed to do it then.

542
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,400
Okay.
So,

543
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:44,180
okay,

544
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,510
if you do that,
we now have an 11 hour working day.

545
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,210
The rate of exploitation goes up,
right?

546
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:55,550
Because now there's seven hours of
surplus labor rather than six hours of

547
00:38:55,551 --> 00:38:57,830
surplus labor. You now
you might say, well,

548
00:38:57,831 --> 00:39:02,560
the workers going to get worn out
sooner and die, uh, sooner. We'll edge.

549
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:07,130
That's just suspend
disbelief about that and say,

550
00:39:07,131 --> 00:39:11,360
in fact, so this, this capitalist is
going to do better than this capitalist.

551
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:17,260
So this capital is going to be able to
sell his or her product more cheaply and

552
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,340
therefore this capital is
going to be in trouble.

553
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:32,870
Paypal. Thank you know,
Marxism capitalists are
afraid of the working class.

554
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:38,030
No. On Marcia's theory, who
is a capitalist if radar,

555
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,850
who is the capitalists looking
over his shoulder rock?

556
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:52,400
Yeah, the capitalist down the street.
Not, they couldn't care less about.

557
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,960
It's not worried about the workers.

558
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:58,970
He's worried about the capitalists who
can come into his industry and produce

559
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,700
more effectively.
Okay.

560
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,220
So if you can,

561
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,600
if you can make these workers work
an extra hour, you're going to do it

562
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:14,600
and then everybody else is
going to have to do it, right?

563
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,160
Or they're going to go on our business.

564
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:21,290
And this is why Mark's wants to say
this is what he calls an increase in

565
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:24,350
absolute,
a surplus value.

566
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:29,350
This is why mark says under
primitive capitalism now,

567
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,920
early stages of capitalism,

568
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:34,910
the battles are going to be over things
like the length of the working day.

569
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:39,410
If any of you have done 19th
century British history,

570
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:43,850
you will know that one of
the big battles started.

571
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,720
This starts with the charters and the
early 19th century. Uh, and goes on.

572
00:40:47,721 --> 00:40:52,070
What are they pushing for the 10 hours
bell? They want the 10 hours bill.

573
00:40:52,071 --> 00:40:55,430
They want parliament to come
in and say working days,

574
00:40:55,431 --> 00:40:58,040
10 hours to limit this.

575
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:02,990
So to the extent that the workers can
organize politically and put pressure to

576
00:41:02,991 --> 00:41:06,710
get a 10 hours bell, then
you, you, you limit this.

577
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:11,360
But in any case, Mark's
wants to say, you know,

578
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:15,440
there are only so many hours in a day
and people do have to sleep after all,

579
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:19,370
so you're not going to get much,
much out of this.

580
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,150
The real secret to capitalism's dynamism,

581
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,700
it's not the move from a to B,
it's the move from a to c.

582
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,190
Notice here we're back at a 10 hours

583
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:38,240
a day,
but now by assumption I'm saying

584
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:45,390
the capitalist is going to cover his
wage bell for that worker in three hours.

585
00:41:46,211 --> 00:41:48,190
We had an for.
How's it going to do that?

586
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:51,040
Yeah,
pardon?

587
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:56,570
But you can't reduce wages because
wages are already at subsistence.

588
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:01,220
So you're going to have to buy assumption.
You, you have to produce the same,

589
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:05,750
you have to pay the same wages.
So how are you going to do it?

590
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:14,890
Technology. Exactly. The name
of the game is technology.

591
00:42:14,891 --> 00:42:19,750
Somebody's going to go and buy a
spinning Jenny and put it in his factory,

592
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:24,700
and then the workers will
work way more productively.

593
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,630
And as a result of that,

594
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:32,080
the capitalists will cover
his wage bill more quickly.

595
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:34,893
Okay.

596
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,300
And of course the minute one
capitalist puts the spinning Jenny in,

597
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:42,480
everybody has to put the
Spinning Jenny yet, right?

598
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:46,170
Or else they're to go out of business
because the capitalists that's covering

599
00:42:46,171 --> 00:42:47,080
his wage,
Bellin,

600
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:51,630
three hours of that work
as work rather than four.

601
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:56,370
It's going to be able to sell a cotton
more cheaply in the market and therefore

602
00:42:56,371 --> 00:43:01,371
out outcompete the capitalist who
still still using the old system.

603
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:08,750
And so the way capitalism works is
that there's constant pressure for

604
00:43:10,111 --> 00:43:13,290
technological innovation because the,

605
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:18,220
this is not a very effective way
of increasing productivity, right?

606
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,760
You can,
in the early stages,

607
00:43:20,761 --> 00:43:24,520
you'll see that by the old there'll
be political limits, 10 hours bill,

608
00:43:24,521 --> 00:43:26,880
there'll be natural limits,
human capacity.

609
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:31,020
So then all the pressure
is on dynamic innovation.

610
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,390
Okay?
Now,

611
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:35,163
okay,

612
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:42,860
this is where it gets interesting
because what he wants to say is, but

613
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:49,410
we know that only living human labor
power producer's surplus value.

614
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:54,540
So as, as you become more
and more capital intensive,

615
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:59,740
the capitalist is spending more and more
on the constant capital unless a nice

616
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,410
on variable capital to put it in modern
jargon production is becoming more

617
00:44:04,411 --> 00:44:05,910
capital intensive.

618
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:10,020
You spending more and more of your,

619
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:12,600
of your investment

620
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,053
on

621
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:18,230
something that does
not produced new value.

622
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,270
So another way you can think
about this, um, and this,

623
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,400
remember I said to you last time,

624
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:29,750
all the classical political economists
thought they had to explain the declining

625
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:30,860
tendency and the rate of

626
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:35,070
what Mark's wants to say is,

627
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,500
okay,

628
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,710
if this is the status quo,
okay?

629
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,510
And one capitalist in the cotton industry
puts in the spinning Jenny and this

630
00:44:45,511 --> 00:44:46,890
becomes the status quo.

631
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:51,810
This capitalist will have higher
profits than this capitalist, right?

632
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,900
But once they've all put
in the spinning Jenny,

633
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,610
the rate of profit in the cotton industry
will be lower than it was up here.

634
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,200
Okay, so there's a, there's a short run,

635
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:08,700
long run conflict of interest for
capitalist because in the short run at the

636
00:45:08,701 --> 00:45:12,720
margin I will innovate
and my profits will go up,

637
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,390
but then everybody will copy me and the,

638
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:20,190
the rate of profit in the cop caught
an industry will fall over time.

639
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:24,580
Now there's,
that's us,

640
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:28,950
there's some dubious assumptions in that
which I'm going to come back to, um,

641
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:30,451
on Monday.

642
00:45:30,451 --> 00:45:35,451
But I first want to just
draw your attention to some
of the normative aspects of

643
00:45:36,961 --> 00:45:41,070
this.
What Marx calls the rate of exploitation,

644
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:46,170
as I said, is the ratio of
surplus to necessary labor time.

645
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,460
But now look down the
right hand side here.

646
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:53,910
What these got all this
is con this jargon,

647
00:45:53,911 --> 00:45:56,590
but you can unpack it here.

648
00:45:56,591 --> 00:46:01,591
Sov is the rate of exploitation and
it's all these things are basically

649
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:06,270
equivalent ratio. But look down
here and now think about this.

650
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,390
Suppose I was a capitalist and
you were a worker working for me.

651
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,500
Okay?

652
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:18,420
And suppose I said Time's a
tough in the cotton industry,

653
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:23,880
you've got a choice.
We can go to here or we can go to here.

654
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:26,640
We can pick B, uh, we can pick C,

655
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,580
but a is no longer an option.

656
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:36,170
A means I'm moving to Mexico can,
can't do a anymore.

657
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:41,960
So take your pick B or c. How many are
you going to take? Pick B. Hands up.

658
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:47,100
How many gonna Pick C. Okay, everybody.

659
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:52,740
But then it seems like this is
very counterintuitive, doesn't it?

660
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,210
Because

661
00:46:58,370 --> 00:46:58,760
mm.

662
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,360
You all went for something that
according to Marx has a higher rate of

663
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,260
exploitation.

664
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:08,860
2.33 as opposed to 1.75.

665
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:13,503
Okay.

666
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:19,560
How can that be? How can
that make any sense? Okay.

667
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:21,220
And I'm just gonna tell you,

668
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:25,050
I'm going to go two minutes over here
to leave you with this to think about,

669
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:28,920
and then we'll pick up with it on Monday.
This is the,

670
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,080
there's a, but if you, if
you think about how people,

671
00:47:35,081 --> 00:47:38,770
how people think about
how well off they are,

672
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,980
the parade oh system says,

673
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:46,330
am I m I on a higher or lower
indifference curve than I was on before?

674
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:52,230
It's a bit like when Ronald Reagan was
running for lead reelection in 1984.

675
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:59,140
His slogan was, are you better off than
you war? Who were four years ago? Right?

676
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:03,820
You look at your situation and you say,
what was my situation? Is it better?

677
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:08,770
Is it worse? Self referential
comparison. Mark says,

678
00:48:08,771 --> 00:48:11,890
no,
that's not the relevant comparison.

679
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:14,620
The relevant comparison
is other referential.

680
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:17,170
You decide how well off you are,

681
00:48:17,171 --> 00:48:22,171
not just by reference to what you get
compared to with what you got before,

682
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:25,870
but what by reference to
what others are getting.

683
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:31,410
So that in this kind of situation if
you say which is worse for the worker,

684
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:37,500
they may well say that a situation in
which they have more is worse than a

685
00:48:39,581 --> 00:48:44,110
situation then which they have less
if the capitalist has even more

686
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,600
so. Mark's wants to say we're
inherently other referential.

687
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:52,300
What are we going to make
us more or less happy?

688
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:56,710
It's not just what we have but
what we have in relation to others.

689
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,480
So now, and it turns out on
this matter, he was half right.

690
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:03,590
Okay.

691
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:04,520
He was half right.

692
00:49:04,521 --> 00:49:09,521
We see from huge number a hundred
years of studies of of sociology.

693
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:17,530
What people find acceptable and desirable
is connected to what others have.

694
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:23,690
But usually it's connected.
And this is where he was half wrong.

695
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:29,200
It's usually collected to what people
who are similarly situated to themselves

696
00:49:29,451 --> 00:49:33,050
have.
So work is in the steel industry,

697
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:37,640
will compare themselves to
work as in the auto industry,

698
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:43,060
but work is in the auto industry while
not compare themselves to what executives

699
00:49:43,821 --> 00:49:45,410
in the auto industry yet.

700
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:50,300
So people are other referential
but in a more horizontal sense.

701
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,690
And this is true up and
down the occupational scale.

702
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:58,730
So if you have been an it
and yell administrator,

703
00:49:58,731 --> 00:50:03,731
one thing you will learn is it will
matter much more to a professor.

704
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:10,690
If he or she learns he's being paid
$2,000 less than the professor down the

705
00:50:11,391 --> 00:50:14,810
corridor.
Then if he or she learns his pain,

706
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:19,840
he or she is being paid $200,000 less
than the attorney who lives next door to

707
00:50:20,271 --> 00:50:24,560
them.
People compare themselves to others,

708
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:28,100
but they compare themselves
to similarly others.

709
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,110
Why that is
is uh,

710
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,150
immensely complicated
and interesting subject,

711
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:40,720
but it means that Marx was right to
think we're basically other referential.

712
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:45,860
We don't just ask the question,
has my utility who have gone up or down?

713
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:50,420
We do. We do compare ourselves
to others, but he was,

714
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:54,890
he was mistaken in thinking that
we would compare that work has,

715
00:50:54,891 --> 00:50:59,891
would compare themselves to capitalists
rather than to other workers in deciding

716
00:51:00,021 --> 00:51:01,760
whether or not they were well off,

717
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:06,350
and that would feed into his assumptions
about the conditions under which

718
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:09,950
workers would be likely
to become militant. Okay.

719
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:12,500
We'll start with that issue on Monday.
