1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:06,530
So today we're gonna talk about majority
rule and democratic competition.

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,260
Whenever we think about democracy,

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,380
there is this automatic,

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,410
almost reflexive impulse to associate
democracy with majority rule.

5
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:24,051
We saw last time that was one of the
things that frighten Madison and his

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,530
contemporaries that they wanted to limit
the power of majority factions as he

7
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:36,020
called them, limit the power of
majority rule. But we think, um,

8
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,060
today reflexively that majority rule
confers legitimacy of some sort on

9
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,990
collective decisions.
And what our agenda today is to,

10
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,780
to dig into why,

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,840
why it is that anybody might think
majority rule has some important normative

12
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:59,390
property.
Any,

13
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,100
anyone have any suggestion
as to why it might,

14
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,270
why might majority, why
should we care? You know, the,

15
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:14,030
the endless recounts in Florida in
2002 who really had the majority,

16
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,450
what's a big deal about majority rule?
Why should we care?

17
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,500
Any,
any takers?

18
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:27,903
Yeah,

19
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,920
I guess it was like a somewhat
utilitarian flavor to that.

20
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,840
Oh, somewhat. What utilitarian
flavor. Tell a Tarion flavor.
So That's interesting.

21
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,850
There might be a utilitarian
justification for majority rule.

22
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,060
Um, just say a little more
about what you have in mind.

23
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,020
Um,

24
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:55,020
because like if the majority of the
societies consents to a certain policy or

25
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,520
approves of a certain person,

26
00:01:57,521 --> 00:02:01,300
it's kind of like they're making the
judgment that having this person having

27
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:04,810
this policy would increase their happiness
or their satisfaction with society

28
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:05,644
the most.

29
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,900
So maximizing governant by majority rule
might in some sense maximize you tell

30
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:14,520
it in the society.
That's a,

31
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:19,200
that's a certainly an interesting iPod
stasis and I'll revisit it in this

32
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:23,280
lecture.
Any other suggestions about majority rule?

33
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,873
No.

34
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,090
Okay.

35
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,600
Going once. Twice. Okay. Gone. All right.

36
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:36,380
We will, we'll revisit. Um,

37
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,540
we'll revisit this utilitarian
thinking because the, it's,

38
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,640
I think it's a very good observation to
make because although it's not explicit

39
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,470
in much of the discussion of majority
rule, I think it is implicit and we'll,

40
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,000
we'll come back to that.

41
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:59,210
The traditional justification for majority
rule was that it somehow identified

42
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,740
the well of the people
that democracy reflects,

43
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:10,741
embodies and it expresses
the will of the people.

44
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:14,860
But of course, you know, that just
puts it one step further back.

45
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,660
What is the well of the people?

46
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,410
How do you know the will of the
people when you trip over it?

47
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:26,250
One of the canonical formulations of
this idea is in John Jack Russo's social

48
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:32,050
contract where he says there's a great
deal of difference between the wheel of

49
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:35,710
all what all individuals
want and the general will,

50
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,160
the general well studies only the common
interest while the will of all studies

51
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:47,281
private interest and is indeed no more
than the sum of individual desires.

52
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,080
But if we take away from these same wells,

53
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,310
the pluses and minuses
which cancel each other out,

54
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,270
the balance,
which remains is the general will.

55
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,420
If we take away from the individual wells,

56
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:08,410
the pluses and minuses
which cancel each other out,

57
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:12,610
the bear balance,
which remains is the general well.

58
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:18,210
So people have spent hundreds of years
trying to figure out whether that makes

59
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,400
any sense,

60
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,810
whether this notion that
you find in Rousseau of

61
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,910
pluses and minuses canceling
one another out makes any sense.

62
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,840
And what sense could it make?
How would we know? As I said,

63
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,850
how would we know the general
will if we fell over it? And,

64
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,223
um,

65
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:49,030
it's often been the case that people
have tended to associate the general will

66
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,480
with the idea of the,
the will of the majority.

67
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:58,880
But going all the way
back to the 18th century,

68
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:04,210
there has been the contrarion mpulse
first noticed by a philosopher called

69
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,430
condor say at the end of the 18th century.

70
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:15,560
But that has since preoccupied
many theorists of democracy.

71
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,390
And that is that,

72
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:22,570
well actually majority rule doesn't
even necessarily reflect the will of the

73
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:28,500
majority.
What condos saying noticed was,

74
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,660
was a very simple fact,

75
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:35,661
which is suppose you have a society where
there are three voters and each voter

76
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:41,450
has a preference over, uh,
three different yeah, policies.

77
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,340
So in this example,

78
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:48,730
voted number one prefers a to B and B
to c voted number c preferred number two

79
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,440
proposed a c to a and a to B.

80
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,520
And number three prefers
B to c and c to add,

81
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,143
well,
you,

82
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:02,530
what Condo say noticed was you get a
paradoxical result because you have a

83
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:07,310
majority for a over B,

84
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,820
you have a majority for B of a c,

85
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,490
but then you have a majority for c over.
Hey,

86
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:21,370
and that seems like a
contradiction because if you,

87
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,840
if you dial back through your notes too,
when we were discussing,

88
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,170
um,
basic properties of rationality,

89
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:33,200
when remember when we were talking about
indifference curves and all of that,

90
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,850
this seems to violate the principle
of trans activity because you have a

91
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:42,050
majority for a over B.
You have a majority firm for B oversee,

92
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:46,850
and then you have a majority
of seat for c over a.

93
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:51,851
So it seems like what our individual
preferences can be rational.

94
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:57,130
Our collective pressure references might
be irrational in the sense that they

95
00:06:58,011 --> 00:06:59,870
contradict themselves.

96
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,460
And so several things follow from this or,

97
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,220
um,
or thought to follow from this,

98
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:12,221
at least one is that this condo
say noticed in the 18th century,

99
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,100
but a famous indeed Nobel prize in any
economist called Kenneth Arrow proved the

100
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:25,361
theorem in 1951 in a little book called
social choice and individual values that

101
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:29,150
this is a perfectly general result.

102
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,420
And so if you have modest
pluralism of preferences, which we,

103
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,690
we were assuming,

104
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,530
remember when we talked about
cross cutting cleavages um,

105
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,860
on Monday we were assuming
it's important for democracy,

106
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,410
diversity of tastes and preferences,

107
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,570
then you can always get this
result with majority rule.

108
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,190
So that's,

109
00:07:52,191 --> 00:07:57,191
so that has a number of
unsettling implications
because it suggests there's no

110
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:01,160
general will identified by the majority.

111
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,470
On the contrary,
if,

112
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,910
if things are put in one order,
you'll get one result.

113
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:12,260
But if things are put in a different
order, you'll get a different result. So,

114
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,130
you know, the white parliamentary
committees often work, um,

115
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,210
you have emotion and then you
have amendments to the emotion.

116
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,820
You always vote on the amendments first.

117
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:25,790
And then the final motion last,

118
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,710
so that another important Theorem,
uh,

119
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,320
approved by somebody called Gerald Kramer.
Um,

120
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,370
about 20 years after
arrows basically says,

121
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,520
if you let me determine the
order of voting, I, he, what?

122
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:47,270
Uh, what, what are the, the amendments
are and what order will end vote on them?

123
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,220
I can get any outcome.

124
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,640
All I have to do is know your preferences
and control the order of voting.

125
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:59,070
And I can get a majority to
appear to support any outcome.

126
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,810
So this is,

127
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,100
this is suggests set majority
rule can be manipulated.

128
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,230
Now you might say, well, and when,
when millions of people are voting,

129
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:11,660
yeah,

130
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:16,100
they, nobody's really controlling
the agenda and that specific a sense.

131
00:09:16,101 --> 00:09:20,030
And nobody has all of that information
about everybody's preferences.

132
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,520
So people can't manipulate the outcome.

133
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,220
That might be true as well.

134
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,280
But it also suggests that there shouldn't
be much moral authority attaching to

135
00:09:30,711 --> 00:09:35,420
the outcome if we know, yeah,
nobody manipulated that, that we,

136
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:40,040
that, that see wins. But if things
had been done in a different order,

137
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:43,910
B might have wine or a might
have one in this circumstance.

138
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,060
So why should we attach any particular
moral authority to the idea that c one,

139
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,230
we shouldn't,
it just an arbitrary resolved.

140
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,530
So footnote to this,

141
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,680
if one important takeaway from Arrow's
theorem is you should always be the last

142
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:06,590
person to interview for a job,
right?

143
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:10,130
Because if they're cyclical preferences
among the interview is over the

144
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:11,090
candidates,

145
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,200
you want the others to bump each other
off and then you come along at the end,

146
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,920
right? So don't say you didn't
learn anything useful today.

147
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:23,060
You certainly learned that they
call you for an interview. Say Well,

148
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:26,990
could I come in three weeks? Why don't
you interview around the candidates first?

149
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,320
So,
um,

150
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,280
majority rule if there is
such a thing as the general,

151
00:10:36,381 --> 00:10:39,560
well majority rule doesn't
seem to identify it.

152
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,100
And the public choice literature that
came out of economics in the 1950s and

153
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:51,311
1960s basically converged
on that proposition it said
there is no such thing as

154
00:10:54,381 --> 00:10:56,120
a social welfare function,

155
00:10:56,121 --> 00:11:01,121
which is just a econ speak for saying
there is no such thing as a general.

156
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:07,001
Well or if there is a general well we
don't know what decision rule would

157
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,730
identify it and a huge amount of ink
has been spelled in trying to figure out

158
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,303
what

159
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,793
yeah,

160
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,200
what decision rule might identify
unambiguously something that we would feel

161
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:29,070
morally comfortable calling the general.
Well,

162
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,570
um,

163
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:35,570
and I don't think anybody has
succeeded definitively at that task

164
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,740
lock.

165
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,740
We always come back to lock in this course
lock has a somewhat different defense

166
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:46,520
of majority rule.

167
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:52,210
Now you might think that's weird because
most people think of Loc as somebody

168
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,290
who defended rights,
right?

169
00:11:56,291 --> 00:12:00,340
We think of if you go and read about
the debates on the constitution,

170
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,160
the lock-ins versus the Republicans.

171
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:05,680
If those of you have
taken a history course,

172
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:10,030
the lock Ian's where the people who
if wanted to create the bill of rights

173
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:13,060
defend against the
majority, uh, and so on.

174
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:15,280
But in fact if you go and read lock,

175
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:20,490
what you find is that he's a
staunch defender of majority rule.

176
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:25,540
He says for when any number of men
have by the consent of every of every

177
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,370
individual made a community.

178
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,800
They have thereby made that community
one body with the power to act as one

179
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:33,550
body,

180
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:38,550
which is only by the will
and determination of the
majority doesn't say why for

181
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:43,150
that which act,

182
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,410
any con for that which acts any
community being only the consent of the

183
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:52,411
individuals of it and being necessary to
that which is one body to move one way.

184
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,830
It is necessary.
The body should move that way.

185
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,380
Whether the greater force carries it,

186
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,980
which is the consent of the
majority or else it is impossible,

187
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:10,360
it should act or confined or
continue one body, one community.

188
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,630
It is.
So he's saying that it's necessary.

189
00:13:13,631 --> 00:13:18,130
The body should move that way
whether the greater force carries it,

190
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,540
which is the consent of the
majority or else it's impossible.

191
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:27,541
It should continue to act one body of
one community which the consent of every

192
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:32,590
individual that United intuit agreed that
it should and so everyone is bound by

193
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:37,591
that consent to be concluded by the
majority and therefore we see that in

194
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:43,471
assemblies empowered to act by positive
laws where no number is set by that

195
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:46,630
positive law,
which empowers them.

196
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,440
The act of the majority passes
for the act of the whole

197
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,120
and of course determines as having by the
law in nature of nature and reason the

198
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:02,270
power of the whole.
So that's locks,

199
00:14:02,271 --> 00:14:06,310
defense of majority rule.
It's not that it identifies some general,

200
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:10,810
well, it's really an
argument about power, right?

201
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,910
He's basically saying,
look,

202
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,800
once you have a community,
somebody who's going to win,

203
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:20,230
it's a little bit like Nozick saying,
you know,

204
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,990
once you have those at
independents out there,

205
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:28,170
somebody's going to force them to join
just a real politic argument that the

206
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,300
power of the majority's going to
determine what the community does.

207
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:39,370
And indeed, if we delve more deeply
into other things that Locke says,

208
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,600
he basically says, look, if you
don't like what the government does,

209
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,340
you can oppose. But if nobody
agrees with you, you should,

210
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,650
as we discussed earlier in the course,

211
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:52,920
you should expect your
reward in the next slide.

212
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,630
If everybody agrees or if
a majority agrees with you,

213
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:02,000
then you can have 1688, right?
You can change the government.

214
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:07,300
So this seems to be an argument about
the legitimacy of the majority that is

215
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,290
very, uh, hard nosed,

216
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,900
realistic judgment about politics.

217
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:20,140
Not a moral claim that the majority has
any particular intrinsic property that

218
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:26,150
gives it the right to govern, right? It's
just saying, well, you know, there it is.

219
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:31,790
Um, the majority is going
to flex its muscles and if,

220
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,620
uh,
if it's not attended to it's going to win.

221
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,063
Okay.

222
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,771
No,

223
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:47,771
I think that we will see lock gets
actually a lot closer to the truth of the

224
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:53,831
desirability of th of majority rule then
Russo date or the people who are trying

225
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:59,441
to come up with a notion of the general
well or what modern economists would

226
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:02,960
call a social welfare function.

227
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,980
And the way you could
think about this argument,

228
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:08,780
particularly in light of the question,

229
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:13,810
the observation about the relationship
between majority rule and utilitarianism

230
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,580
is that I think, I think the best way
to think of what Locke is doing here,

231
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:22,760
it's a kind of negative utilitarianism,
uh,

232
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,670
or at least a cousin of
negative utilitarianism.

233
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:30,530
We generally think of negative
utilitarianism as the doctrine that um,

234
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:36,710
we should minimize pain as opposed
to positive utilitarianism,

235
00:16:36,711 --> 00:16:40,730
which is maximize pleasure.
We didn't make that discussion,

236
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,130
that distinction when
we talked about Bentham,

237
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:48,080
but it's there in the contemporary
literature. So this is a cousin,

238
00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:53,081
I think of negative libertarian
as a negative utilitarianism
in the sense that I

239
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:58,241
think that Locke thinks as of majority
rule and indeed of resistance to power as

240
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:05,270
a way of limiting the
possibility of domination,

241
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,380
limiting the possibility of domination,

242
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,830
and he's saying the majority can.

243
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,800
You can resist power if
power is dominating you,

244
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:20,801
but you're only going to win if you're
in the majority if you have the greater

245
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:22,933
force.

246
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:29,020
But why is majority rule the instrument
for limiting the possibility of

247
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:33,494
domination?

248
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,840
Why should we think of majority
rule as having that propensity?

249
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,530
Anyone got a suggestion?

250
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:51,410
Why should we think that majority rule
all things considered would limit the

251
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:56,580
possibility of domination?
Just a hard question. Yeah.

252
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:01,710
Well,

253
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:05,400
it seems to go back to the crosscutting
cleavages that we talked about the other

254
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,430
day, that if you're going
to be in the majority,

255
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:10,710
you don't know if you're going to
be in the minority and other things.

256
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,680
So you would eliminate the
domination that you put out.

257
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,250
You wouldn't want to be a dominant player
in presence for fear that there'd be

258
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:19,350
other domineering presence
is and other spheres.

259
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,760
I think that's exactly right. I think
you've hit the nail on the head. He said,

260
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:28,761
well it's related to the clause cross
cutting cleavages and one's not knowing

261
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,880
whether or not,
um,

262
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,240
the policies that get enacted are going
to be the policies that you want or

263
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:44,820
whether you're going to regard them as
being imposed on you and dominating you.

264
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:49,950
So the, the people, I'll come
back to your point in a minute,

265
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,760
but as, as background to an
industry show, I think why exactly.

266
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:56,760
Exactly why you're right.
And what turns on that you said,

267
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:02,220
think about another prize winning
economist who's theorized about politics.

268
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,440
This is a book published in 1962 by
the economist James Buchanan and the

269
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,390
political scientists,

270
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:17,391
Gordon Tulloch for which Buchanan and
got the Nobel prize in 1986 and Tulloch

271
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:23,760
was not happy. Um, and
that was the argument was,

272
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:28,510
well, we don't have any,
uh, a Nobel prize for,

273
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,950
for political science.
That's why they gave it to Buchanan.

274
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:36,330
Although you may know that
last year, um, in a slap,

275
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,680
in a slap at their own discipline.
In fact, for the first time,

276
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:45,580
the Nobel prize committee did give than
over our price to a political scientist,

277
00:19:45,581 --> 00:19:50,160
to a woman by the name of Eleanor
Ostrum at the University of Indiana.

278
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,390
But that was then, and
this is now in 1996, uh,

279
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,010
Buchanan and got the recognition
and Telec was not happy. Uh,

280
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:01,260
and he as he widely let it be known.

281
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,870
So he has the intuition.
It's, it's, it's, it,

282
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,430
it is behind the veil of ignorance.
This book, interestingly,

283
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:16,560
longtime before roles wrote 1962 but
the basic ideas behind the veil of

284
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:18,150
ignorance,
what,

285
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,530
how would you think about the
decision rules that should govern you?

286
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:28,840
How can you reason about
that? And they said, wow,

287
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,533
okay.

288
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,080
What you have to think about
is two things. One is how,

289
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,070
how likely is it

290
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,690
that the society's going to do something
you don't like and what can you do

291
00:20:46,691 --> 00:20:49,720
about,
okay.

292
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:54,670
And related to that,
you have to think how much do you care?

293
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,200
Because some import,

294
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:00,100
some decisions are much more
important to you than other decisions.

295
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,400
Why does it matter how much you care?

296
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:08,350
Because being involved in decision
making takes up time, effort,

297
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:11,590
energy that you could
spend doing other things.

298
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,560
So if it's some utterly trivial decision,

299
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:16,780
you're not going to want to
spend a lot of time on it.

300
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,740
But if it's a really important decision
then you'll be willing to spend time on

301
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:26,830
it in order to make sure your
rights are protected. Okay.

302
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,850
So they make a distinction between,

303
00:21:30,851 --> 00:21:33,610
first of all what they
call external costs.

304
00:21:33,611 --> 00:21:36,500
And the idea here is that

305
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,733
yeah,

306
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,300
as the number of people
in the society goes up,

307
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,580
the chances,

308
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:59,130
the chances that you're going to have
some decision imposed on you that you

309
00:21:59,131 --> 00:22:03,900
don't like also goes up because there
are all kinds of decisions that people

310
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,380
could make. Right? On the other hand,

311
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,750
there are decision making cost too.

312
00:22:09,751 --> 00:22:12,840
And as the number of people
and the society goes up,

313
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:18,030
the decision making costs increase as
well because they're more people to talk

314
00:22:18,031 --> 00:22:20,100
to,
to negotiate with and so on.

315
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:25,470
And so what you have to
think about is the summer,

316
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,910
those two things, the, the,
the, how important is it to you?

317
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,283
Right?

318
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,170
Okay.

319
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:37,040
How important is it? Is it to you
to participate in decision making?

320
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:39,380
It's going to be how much do you,

321
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,760
how much do you care about the result
and how much time you're going to have to

322
00:22:43,761 --> 00:22:44,900
spend on the result.

323
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,280
And what they said in a kind
of utilitarian calculus,

324
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,670
they said what you're going
to want to do is add a mop.

325
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:58,040
So you're going to want to minimize
the sum of the external costs and the

326
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:02,030
decision making costs, right?
You're going to want to minimize

327
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,343
that.

328
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,660
So when a decision is
completely unimportant to you,

329
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,473
yeah,

330
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,150
then you won't want to
spend a lot of time.

331
00:23:16,151 --> 00:23:18,310
But when a decision is
really important to you,

332
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:22,120
you will be willing to spend time.
Okay?

333
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:25,450
And so then they said, well
sir, how should we think about

334
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:32,230
the organization of Society for
questions that people think are really

335
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:33,080
important?

336
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:37,370
We should have something like
unanimity role because after all,

337
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,700
unanimity rule is a veto of one.

338
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,040
Okay.

339
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,490
Right? Anybody, if you, if you have
unanimity rule, it's like the parade. Oh,

340
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:47,324
principal,

341
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,420
anybody can veto everybody's agreement
has to be gotten in the limiting case.

342
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:58,580
If you had absolute unanimity rule,
you can't do anything uh, without,

343
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,860
uh, that. Okay.

344
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,390
Whereas for less important decisions,

345
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,990
this point here where you minimize

346
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:15,610
when you're minimizing the sum of
external costs and decision making costs,

347
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,380
while there'll be something
less than unanimity role,

348
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:26,500
it might be a two thirds rule and even
less important things you might say,

349
00:24:26,571 --> 00:24:30,530
majority rule and even less important
things than that. You might say, you know,

350
00:24:30,531 --> 00:24:35,090
let the bureaucrats decide. It's
just not worth my time. Okay.

351
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,470
So Fort Buchanan and Telec,

352
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:44,710
there's no presumption that there's
any particular importance attaching to

353
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,810
majority rule.
On the contrary,

354
00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:50,270
we should say for the
most important things,

355
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,720
we should start with unanimity
rule and then we can,

356
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:58,290
we can come down the ladder of
all we can think about, you know,

357
00:24:58,291 --> 00:25:03,291
just steadily declining a super majorities
as things become less important to

358
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:06,750
us. And so the, the,

359
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,430
the argument was that for
constitutional questions,

360
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:15,080
it should be something very
close to unanimity rule.

361
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:19,970
And we should have entrenched was semi
and trenched clauses that are virtually

362
00:25:19,971 --> 00:25:21,170
impossible to change.

363
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:25,310
And something that more so in whether
it's they're telling a story that more or

364
00:25:25,311 --> 00:25:29,570
less reflects the structure of the
American constitution where amending the

365
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:32,150
Constitution does take,
um,

366
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,060
very hard to get super majorities,

367
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,210
but regular legislation takes a lot less.

368
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,730
And it's simply this calculation,

369
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
this self interested
calculation that I'm lead.

370
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:47,870
You too often,
uh,

371
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,280
often be willing to go with majority
rule and there's nothing more to be said

372
00:25:52,281 --> 00:25:54,170
about it than that.

373
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:00,490
So now we come to your observation
and your observation is basically the

374
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:02,240
observation that you can,

375
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:07,250
and then Telecar wrong that Buchanan
and Telec are wrong because they confuse

376
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:16,570
unanimity is a state of affairs in the
world where we all agree about something

377
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,500
with unanimity as a decision
rule. And this, this,

378
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:24,680
your observation was
first made by Brian Berry,

379
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,920
who sadly died last year in a very good
book called political argument and was

380
00:26:30,441 --> 00:26:35,441
developed by Douglas Ray who teaches
here in som into a important articles in

381
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:39,200
the American political science review.

382
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:44,100
And what Barry and ray pointed out was
exactly what this gentleman pointed out,

383
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,500
um,
a few minutes ago,

384
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:51,501
which is the hall Buchanan and
Salak story assumes we have,

385
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,160
we have an agreement at the baseline.

386
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:02,630
The hall Buchanan and talk story assumes
that everybody's happy with the initial

387
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,590
state of affairs. Uh,
and so then we say, well,

388
00:27:07,591 --> 00:27:12,591
so we started that baseline and then we
say the things that are most important

389
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:15,480
to you from that baseline,

390
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:20,700
we will give what cried
unanimity rule and give you, uh,

391
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,810
every, everyone in the room,
essentially a veto. Right?

392
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,790
But then we'll work down from that.

393
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:31,170
But what ray and Barry said was,
wow,

394
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:32,840
okay,

395
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,930
what if we say that behind
this veil of ignorance,

396
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,730
we don't know whether we're going
to like the status quo or not.

397
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,850
Maybe we will,
maybe we won't.

398
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:51,230
But if you don't want to give any
special status to the status quo,

399
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:56,450
then you shouldn't buy us
decisions to the status quo.

400
00:27:56,451 --> 00:27:58,610
Because maybe it'll turn out

401
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:04,860
that you don't want the status quo and
then you're stuck with something that's

402
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:09,660
impossible to change, right? And so, um,

403
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:13,590
what Barry and ray showed was,
well actually

404
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:19,990
if you assume behind a veil of ignorance
that your is likely to be against the

405
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:22,750
status quo as in favor of his status quo,

406
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:27,430
then you would choose majority
rule or something very close to it.

407
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,580
So I know if the number of
people in this society is even,

408
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:34,900
you would choose n over two plus
one or Nana and over two minus one.

409
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:40,290
If you are wanting to minimize the
probability that a decision's going to be

410
00:28:40,421 --> 00:28:45,421
imposed upon you not knowing whether or
not it was the decision favored by the

411
00:28:47,231 --> 00:28:48,130
status quo.

412
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:53,460
So there's a kind of veil of ignorance
logic in the Buchanan and in there,

413
00:28:53,651 --> 00:28:56,550
ray and Barry critique a
big cannon and Tagalog,

414
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,800
which says that the presumption should
be in favor of majority rule or something

415
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,100
very close to it and less.

416
00:29:06,101 --> 00:29:11,030
We want to buy us the whole
system toward the status quo. Uh,

417
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,970
and we don't actually have any
Altima at good reason for doing that.

418
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:21,340
It was even if somebody at
some constitutional convention
preferred to entrench

419
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:27,310
whatever it is,
the right to bear arms 200 years later,

420
00:29:27,311 --> 00:29:30,040
we might not take the view
that we want to entrench that,

421
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:34,120
but now it becomes impossibly
hard to change. Okay.

422
00:29:34,121 --> 00:29:36,880
So if if you say behind
the veil of ignorance,

423
00:29:36,881 --> 00:29:40,960
we're going to be as likely
to oppose as to support.

424
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,440
There does seem to be a kind of negative
utilitarian logic which says if I want

425
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:51,751
to minimize the likelihood of having
decisions I'd are like imposed upon me.

426
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:58,720
I would prefer majority rule,
uh, to the garden alternatives.

427
00:29:59,770 --> 00:29:59,951
Well,

428
00:29:59,951 --> 00:30:04,951
that's all very well and I think that's
the barrier and ray argument is pretty

429
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:10,150
robust. It's certainly stood up for
what now close to half a century.

430
00:30:10,151 --> 00:30:13,150
It's regarded as conventional
wisdom on this point.

431
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,280
I'm still in all,

432
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:19,720
it doesn't tell us a lot about
the dynamics of actual politics.

433
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:25,530
How does competitive democracy play out
in when we thinking about how actual

434
00:30:25,871 --> 00:30:30,850
political systems,
actual democratic systems operate.

435
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,040
And you'll recall that
from Monday's lecture.

436
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:41,460
I said to you that Robert Dahl was the
most important democratic theorist of the

437
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:43,540
second half of the 20th century,

438
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,230
but I didn't talk about the first
half of the 20th century. And,

439
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,240
and I think the most important democratic
theorists of the first half of the

440
00:30:52,241 --> 00:30:57,241
20th century who in many ways dall built
upon was actually an economist by the

441
00:30:58,781 --> 00:31:00,550
name of Joseph Schumpeter.

442
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,880
Economist had a lot of influence in
democratic theory in the 20th century.

443
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:09,340
Schumpeter wrote a book called capitalism,

444
00:31:09,341 --> 00:31:14,230
socialism and democracy,
which he published in 1942,

445
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,520
eight years before his death. And, um,

446
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,680
most of that book is actually
completely unremarkable.

447
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:28,360
Most of that book is a long and read
the tortured critique of Karl Marx.

448
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,910
But the,
the piece,

449
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,500
the piece of it we're focusing on are
those two little chapters called the

450
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:39,430
classical theory of democracy
and another theory of democracy.

451
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:40,630
And the,

452
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:45,430
I should say that those two little
chapters that may be the most influential,

453
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:50,380
uh, writings about democracy
in the real world, uh,

454
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,730
that have came out of the 20th century.
Now,

455
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,750
it should also be sad just as, as
a prefatory matter that the, the,

456
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,760
the title of the first chapter of those
two chapters is misleading because what

457
00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:10,990
he calls the classical theory of democracy
is actually a neoclassical theory.

458
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:16,210
It is Russo's idea of the general will,
which we now know to be,

459
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,050
um, chimerical. Um, but you know,

460
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:24,520
from Monday's lecture that Russo's
idea of the general will was actually a

461
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:29,521
neoclassical adaptation because the
ancient Greek idea was ruling and being

462
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:32,880
ruled in turn, right? So that,

463
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:37,720
so showing paid his act critique of
what he calls the classical theory of

464
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:38,291
democracy,

465
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:43,291
we should remember is actually a
neoclassical 18th century idea.

466
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:49,410
But he starts from the
proposition that the,

467
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:54,680
the critique of the idea that general
will is valid. There's no such thing.

468
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:59,630
There is no social welfare function
as an economist would put it.

469
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,990
And he says he Shum pay.
This says,

470
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,640
let's think about democracy in
a fundamentally different way.

471
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,970
Let's define it as follows.

472
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
The democratic method is that
institutional arrangement for arriving at

473
00:33:16,281 --> 00:33:21,281
political decisions in which individuals
acquire the power to decide by means of

474
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:26,870
a competitive struggle.
For the people's vote.

475
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,273
Okay.

476
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:37,330
And now he's going to develop this idea
in that second little chapter with an

477
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:40,760
analogy to the market.

478
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,000
He's going to think about
democracy as shopping.

479
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:01,570
Schumpeter says, look,
think about democracy.

480
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:07,380
Think about the the Po polity
as an analog of the economy.

481
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,260
What do we have in the economy

482
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:15,370
and what do we have in the policy?
Well,

483
00:34:15,371 --> 00:34:17,980
one thing we have in the
economy is consumers,

484
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:20,243
right?

485
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,920
In the what are, what is the political
analog of consumers? Any guesses?

486
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,920
What's the political analog of consumers?

487
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:42,730
Voters. Voters. What?

488
00:34:42,731 --> 00:34:46,290
Another thing we have in the economy
is firms. What's the political animal?

489
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,780
I got firms.
Anybody.

490
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:55,050
You have the mic guess various
candidates for positions. Yeah.

491
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,530
Parties.
Good enough.

492
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,220
Okay.

493
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:02,480
Firms make profits.
What is the political analog of profits?

494
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,890
Whoever wins the election hellos. Why
did they get, how did they get votes?

495
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,180
Exactly. So firms, one
profits, parties, one votes.

496
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:19,790
Then firms produce products. What?
What is produced in the polity?

497
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:24,170
Various party platforms.
Platforms. Yeah. And legislation.

498
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:29,740
And so when we think of the doctrine
of consumer sovereignty in economics,

499
00:35:30,501 --> 00:35:32,660
what would the political analog of at bay

500
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:39,900
this one leap out at you?
But okay,

501
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:44,400
it's the idea of democratic
legitimacy is the equivalent.

502
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,810
When we say there's consumer
sovereignty and markets, there's demo,

503
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:53,720
there's democratic legitimacy in
the policy. And so we have this,

504
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:58,990
this basic parallel between the economic
system where firms are competing,

505
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:06,060
firms are competing for
profits, right? And they,

506
00:36:06,061 --> 00:36:11,061
they engage in a competitive struggle
for the consumers dollar to paraphrase

507
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,110
Schumpeter,
right?

508
00:36:13,111 --> 00:36:17,910
And parties are competing for votes
and they engage in a competitive and a

509
00:36:17,911 --> 00:36:20,070
struggle for the people's vote.

510
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:25,850
And democracy is not about participation
or deliberation or all of the things

511
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:33,060
that people try to identify
with. It's essentially, as
I said, it's about shopping.

512
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:38,310
You shop for policies and
politicians and policies. Injustice,

513
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,250
same way as you shop for iPods and

514
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,400
Maseratis or whatever it is you buy.
Okay?

515
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:50,490
This is how we should
think about democracy.

516
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:55,950
Hugely influential,
right? Hugely influential.

517
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:00,780
And that what disciplines the elites,

518
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,950
what disciplines the elites is the,

519
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:08,130
that creates the democratic legitimacy.

520
00:37:08,131 --> 00:37:13,131
Or maybe I should've put democratic
accountability there is the fact that the,

521
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:18,240
that the voter can kick the bums out,
right?

522
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,710
It's Gordon Brown's worrying about
this for the next few weeks, right?

523
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:27,180
The British voters, can
he have 'em out, right?

524
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:31,350
That is what disciplines
the political elites.

525
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:36,560
That is what prevents them ultimately
from exercising domination.

526
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,480
And so we think about,

527
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,583
okay,

528
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:48,210
we think about a competitive system driven
by politicians who are competing for

529
00:37:49,991 --> 00:37:50,824
votes.

530
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:56,200
Turns out there's a big
tradition in American political
science of studying this.

531
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,750
That goes back to an a,
again,

532
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:03,670
another economist is kind of depressing
all these economists, but there it is, uh,

533
00:38:03,671 --> 00:38:06,480
in 1929 who, who, uh,

534
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:10,840
hotelling who wrote a paper
trying to explain why is it,

535
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:16,960
why is it that if you,
if you look at a town,

536
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:21,550
any town you'll find target and

537
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,773
mmm,

538
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,960
you'll find a what,
what's another,

539
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:33,990
what you'll find a shores and stop and
shop right next to each other on main

540
00:38:34,091 --> 00:38:36,340
street, uh, and downs,

541
00:38:36,341 --> 00:38:40,240
develop this into a political
argument. He basically, he said,

542
00:38:40,241 --> 00:38:43,000
imagine you've got,
um,

543
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:47,560
a continuum here from
left to right. So, uh,

544
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:52,470
that people with, with ideas, this
is ideology. People on the left,

545
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,030
I have people on the writer here,
well,

546
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:59,740
we should think the population's more
or less normally distributed, right?

547
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:05,730
So most people are in the middle and
some people are at the two extremes.

548
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:07,850
Well,

549
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:13,020
if you have two political parties,

550
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,423
okay,

551
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,030
where are they going to head for?

552
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:25,440
They're going ahead for the median voter
because that's where most of the votes

553
00:39:25,441 --> 00:39:27,660
are, right? So

554
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:28,980
yeah,

555
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,030
you might have differences of
opinion within the parties.

556
00:39:33,031 --> 00:39:37,710
I'll come back to that in a
minute. But basically, um, whoops,

557
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,830
why we

558
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,190
getting too far ahead of ourselves?
Yeah.

559
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,170
Parties are going to head for the median
voter because that's where the boats

560
00:39:57,171 --> 00:39:57,891
are.
You know,

561
00:39:57,891 --> 00:40:02,480
we said when they asked
to wherever it was,

562
00:40:02,481 --> 00:40:04,760
why do you rob banks?
Because that's where the money is.

563
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,050
Politicians are going to go
for the median voter, right?

564
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:14,570
That's where the boats are. Now,
of course, they could be wrong.

565
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:17,270
They're going to guess.
So for example,

566
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:22,300
1964 Goldwater runs,
um,

567
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:25,430
running for president,
um,

568
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:29,900
thinks that the median
voter is way over here,

569
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,710
but he's wrong. So he
loses then, you know,

570
00:40:35,711 --> 00:40:38,980
1980 Ronald Reagan basically,

571
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,333
mmm.

572
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:47,360
Runs on exactly the same platform
that Goldwater had lost on in 1964 and

573
00:40:49,111 --> 00:40:52,830
everybody says this crazy right wing,
not, it's going to be creamed. We,

574
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:58,050
we saw that in 1964 but either
because he knew something,

575
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:03,360
uh, or because he was lucky
or some combination. Uh,

576
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,920
it turned out that between 1964 and 1980,

577
00:41:07,921 --> 00:41:12,921
the median voter had moved and Jimmy
Carter was wrong about where the median

578
00:41:13,051 --> 00:41:16,590
voter was. Okay. So, um,

579
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,350
generally speaking,
other things equal,

580
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:23,980
the parties would converge to the median
voter or at least where they believe

581
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,520
the median voter is and the
people who get it right,

582
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,520
we'll win right now

583
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,370
that seems to have the implication

584
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:39,940
that particularly as polling gets better
and better so you don't make the kind

585
00:41:40,701 --> 00:41:45,701
of mistakes the Democrats made in
1980 or the Republicans made in 1964,

586
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,860
the potluck parties are going to keep
offering exactly the same start offering

587
00:41:51,861 --> 00:41:56,420
exactly the same policies. Right.
And indeed, if you look at the,

588
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,410
I didn't,

589
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:00,890
I don't know how much attention you
folks are paying to the British election,

590
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:04,700
but basically they're offering
the same policies. Um,

591
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,060
they're saying they're
both saying the other.

592
00:42:07,061 --> 00:42:09,170
So going to lie to you about
what they're going to do,

593
00:42:09,171 --> 00:42:11,670
but we're going to keep the national
health service, we're going to,

594
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,730
we're not going to cut this.
We're not going to cut that.

595
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:16,700
We're not going to do this to taxes
because they've done all the polling.

596
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,280
They know what the median voter once.

597
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:22,270
And so they basically
offering the same policy.

598
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:26,780
So I'll come back to what that
means for political competition,

599
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:31,910
uh, in a minute. Um, but

600
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,423
okay,

601
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:42,780
if that competing, if that basically
offering the same policies,

602
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,340
what are they competing over? What are
they putting in front of the electric?

603
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,460
If that basically both
doing the same thing.

604
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:07,300
They're going to compete over things
like, you know, character assassination.

605
00:43:07,301 --> 00:43:10,470
They're going to say he's a vote.
He vote for me cause he's alive.

606
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:14,340
He says he won't cut the hell service
buddy. Well, the other one will say,

607
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:18,780
he says he won't raise taxes, but he will.
They said, well, he's this honorable,

608
00:43:18,781 --> 00:43:21,150
he was involved in this,
that and the other scandal.

609
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:22,350
That's what they're going to do.

610
00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:26,460
They couldn't compete over
personalities right now.

611
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:28,080
One way you could,

612
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:29,500
okay.

613
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:34,500
Imagine something that would change that
is if there were other variables that

614
00:43:35,231 --> 00:43:37,660
kept these parties apart.
So for example,

615
00:43:37,661 --> 00:43:42,661
we have primaries now in the u s and
of course the primary voters on the,

616
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:45,360
on the Democratic Party R.
Dot.

617
00:43:45,361 --> 00:43:50,361
Over here probably normally distributed
and the primary voters in the Republican

618
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,580
Party are here.
If you have to win the primary first,

619
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:58,390
then you're going to get pulled down
here and the republic is going to have

620
00:43:58,391 --> 00:44:00,220
pulled over there,
right?

621
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:05,430
And so what happens is if you have
some other force that pulls the parties

622
00:44:06,881 --> 00:44:07,714
apart,

623
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:09,850
yeah,

624
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:14,590
then you might get competition
of a policy. Some people say, oh,

625
00:44:14,591 --> 00:44:19,090
it's bad to have primaries
because if you have primaries,

626
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:19,983
um,

627
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,880
the activists get control of the parties
and the extremists in both party.

628
00:44:24,881 --> 00:44:29,740
You know, the unions control what
the Democratic Party does. Uh,

629
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:34,110
and the far right controls what the
Republican Party does. It's true.

630
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,980
But the flip side of that is that when,

631
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:39,900
when the general election comes,

632
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:44,430
you actually have competition
of a policies because the
parties have been pulled

633
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:49,431
apart by the fact that they had
to win these primaries first.

634
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:52,620
Now there are other bad
sides of primaries, but,

635
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:57,770
but part of that point here is you need
to see that what it is that parties

636
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:01,200
compete over can change,
right?

637
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,510
So when we put in the general election,

638
00:45:03,511 --> 00:45:07,290
the parties have been
pulled somewhat apart. Um,

639
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:12,510
so if, if you have something in
the structure of political parties,

640
00:45:12,511 --> 00:45:15,610
it could be primaries,
it could be a strong, uh,

641
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:20,630
control of the party selection process
by the leadership or something like that.

642
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:24,870
Then you will get, um,
competition of a policy.

643
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:29,790
Now you could see some people would say
that's better because people get a clear

644
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:34,020
choice as opposed to just character
assassination and that sort of thing.

645
00:45:34,021 --> 00:45:38,670
It's actually better for them to
compete over policies. Notice though,

646
00:45:38,671 --> 00:45:43,671
if you do have strong parties that it
kept up ideologically apart and you have

647
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:47,940
competition of a policy,
you can get results.

648
00:45:47,941 --> 00:45:50,460
Like in Britain,

649
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:56,130
British railways have been nationalized
and d nationalized three times in the

650
00:45:56,131 --> 00:46:00,780
20th century, you know, because labor
comes in and nationalized as them.

651
00:46:00,781 --> 00:46:04,110
And then the Tories come in
and d nationalized them. Um,

652
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,640
so you get policy alternation and that
could be good or bad. It's not bad.

653
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:10,650
It's a different thing to compete over.

654
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,810
So you can have competition
over personalities,

655
00:46:15,811 --> 00:46:19,800
you can have competition over policies.
And of course you can have,

656
00:46:19,801 --> 00:46:21,600
as we do in our system,

657
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:27,050
you can have competition of a pork
if you have a system in which,

658
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:29,643
um,

659
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:34,260
you have individual constituencies like
we do in the u s you have congressional

660
00:46:34,261 --> 00:46:36,480
staff constituencies,
and then you have states,

661
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,290
each representative is really looking for,

662
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:45,090
not the national median voter, but the
median voter in their district. Right?

663
00:46:45,091 --> 00:46:48,810
Or in this state, that's
who they're serving. Right.

664
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,760
And so there's a lot of literature
about whether it's better to have

665
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:58,820
proportional representation where you
have basically one national constituency

666
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:04,130
or whether you should have a system
in which politicians compete with one

667
00:47:05,401 --> 00:47:09,450
another as to who's going to bring
more pork back to our district.

668
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:10,650
Okay.

669
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:15,650
So I mentioned these things only so that
you're aware that once we talk about,

670
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:20,330
uh, political competition,
we haven't settled, uh,

671
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:25,080
what it is that parties compete
over. Um, but champagne,

672
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:28,830
he did an address these because
shown pay to ultimately didn't,

673
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,310
he didn't care really whether they
were competing over personalities,

674
00:47:33,311 --> 00:47:34,480
policies or pork.

675
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:39,930
The point was that they were competing
and they wanted to throw one another out.

676
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:45,840
This is the system to Harken
back to Monday's lecture.

677
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:50,830
This is a system in which ambition
really counteract ambition,

678
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:56,550
whereas separation of powers and all
that for the reasons doll gave doesn't

679
00:47:56,831 --> 00:48:00,100
really work. There's no
mechanism, right? But this,

680
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:04,540
this creates a mechanism for
ambition to counteract ambition.

681
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:07,240
So Schumpeter and Darla,

682
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:11,890
much more sympathetic to the idea of
pluralism and crosscutting cleavages and a

683
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:16,720
competitive struggle with the people's
vote than they are to institutional

684
00:48:16,721 --> 00:48:20,590
checks.
And balances to discipline elites.

685
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,670
Of course,
there are problems with Schumpeter.

686
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:29,170
I'll just mention them briefly because
we're running short of time and you can

687
00:48:29,171 --> 00:48:33,970
pursue them, uh, in section, but one is

688
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,890
year and a half, two parties or
maybe three parties or for parties.

689
00:48:38,891 --> 00:48:42,440
It's all it got polycystic
competition. It's not, um,

690
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:48,070
a very thorough going form of competition.
So that's one thing to think about.

691
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,160
Secondly,
um,

692
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:55,480
this whole thing doesn't address
the role of money in politics.

693
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:57,490
You will see this,
uh,

694
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:02,610
in sharp relief in the
state of Connecticut in the
next eight months were um,

695
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,400
the Republican,

696
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:10,540
what the likely Republican nominee
for Chris Dodd Senate seat has already

697
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:10,971
announced.

698
00:49:10,971 --> 00:49:15,640
She's going to spend $50 million
of her own money on her campaign.

699
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,760
And so it Attorney General
Richard Blumenthal,

700
00:49:18,761 --> 00:49:22,720
who's the likely Democrat has to
raise a lot of money. So it's,

701
00:49:22,721 --> 00:49:26,320
it's not necessarily competitive
struggle for the people's vote,

702
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:30,920
but rather struggle for money.
And that has implications, uh,

703
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:35,500
which you should think about.
Notice third,

704
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,680
that this Shump Astarria and
story completely be values
participation after all

705
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:47,280
a buys into the Buchanan and [inaudible]
definition of the problem where we saw

706
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:53,110
participation was defined as a cost,
a cost of,

707
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,080
if you have to spend time
participating in politics,

708
00:49:56,290 --> 00:50:00,100
it's time you could be spending driving
your Maserati and you'd rather be doing

709
00:50:00,101 --> 00:50:03,130
that. That's the assumption, right?

710
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:08,410
How good an assumption is that maybe
participation is inherently valuable,

711
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:11,140
then you have to think about that.

712
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,270
Yeah.

713
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:17,800
And then finally, it really is a
minimal conception of democracy right

714
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:24,310
now. Some people have operationalized
shown, paid it to say,

715
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:28,160
and this is true in the,
in the comparative literature about,

716
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:33,390
about new democracies that we can't
call a system of democracy until the

717
00:50:33,981 --> 00:50:38,960
government has twice lost an election
and given up power. Um, this is called,

718
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:42,380
she'll sometimes called the
[inaudible] two turnover test.

719
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:47,890
Famous Harvard political scientist Dude
recently died called Samuel Huntington,

720
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,510
came up with the two turnover test.

721
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:55,760
We can call something a democracy unless
it's been as turnover at least twice.

722
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,900
Uh, in one way. That's a stiff test.

723
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:03,020
Japan didn't meet it until very recently.

724
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:08,660
The U s didn't meet it until 1840
India didn't meet it until recently.

725
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:12,510
South Africa, which people crow about
as a new democracy has yet to me.

726
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:16,010
Did we don't know what would
happen if the ANC lost an election?

727
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,820
Would they give up hour?
Maybe, maybe not. Okay.

728
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:23,540
So in one respect, it's
a robust test, but,

729
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,090
but people criticize it as being minimal.

730
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:30,950
Say really this more
to democracy than that.

731
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:35,760
And we'll come back to that question next
week, but what I want you to take ways,

732
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:38,720
I think the enduring insight,
um,

733
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,960
of the Schumpeterian model
that really starts with locks.

734
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:49,190
Linking lock was very prescient.
He saw three centuries ahead,

735
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:54,460
linking of majority rule to this
idea of resisting domination,

736
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,990
that non domination,
this idea of resisting domination,

737
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:03,620
however you institutionalize it and
operationalize it and all of that.

738
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:09,040
That is the basic animating ideal of
democracy will pick up from there on

739
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:12,770
Monday.
