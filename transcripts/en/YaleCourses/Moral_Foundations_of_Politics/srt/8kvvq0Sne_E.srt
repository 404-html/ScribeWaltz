1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,980
But what I wanted to do today was pursue
the discussion of democratic justice.

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,460
I talked about it as a semi contextual
idea and that there's a general argument

3
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:19,041
which we discussed on Monday that
recognizes the subordinate character of a

4
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,630
democratic constraints on the
superordinate goods that people pursue in

5
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:28,560
different walks of life.

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,860
And I said it was a semi
contextual argument, uh,

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,100
with the implication that the way you
work that out varies with time and

8
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:42,390
circumstance.
It varies at different times in the same,

9
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,890
in the same setting,
but then also it varies across settings.

10
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:48,950
So if we think about,
um,

11
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,930
the traditional family in
America in the 1950s, um,

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,090
which is more or less
captured, I think, uh,

13
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,570
at least with respect to governing
children in this picture,

14
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,780
that's of course very different than the
traditional family life we might find a

15
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:09,820
in South Africa in the 1980s,
uh,

16
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,040
and where you go depends
upon where you start. Um,

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,233
and the,

18
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,270
the basic impulse behind democratic
justice as a kind of democratized Berkey

19
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:26,090
aneurysm. That is to say
it recognizes that, um,

20
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,790
along with the anti enlightened
theorists that we'd been,

21
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,670
we never design institutions are fresh,

22
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,740
rather we redesign institutions that we
inherit and reproduce into the future.

23
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,090
Um,

24
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,090
but we other than just a reproduce
them into the future in a conservative

25
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:45,294
fashion,

26
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,280
the impulsive democratic justice is to
democratize them as we reproduce them

27
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:54,030
into the future. And so, um,

28
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,890
when we think about restructuring
the family or restructuring,

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,640
uh, the system of education
or restructuring any, uh,

30
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,520
realm of collective activity,

31
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,380
the idea is to take the inherited
systems of norms and practices, uh,

32
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:15,381
in Bueb the values that
are embedded in them,

33
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,740
learn about them, um, but then not
be on critical. Think we had a,

34
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,920
as we reproduce them into the future,

35
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,660
how they could be restructured
in accordance with the,

36
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,580
the basic impulse of democratic justice,

37
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:34,581
which is to democratize the power
dimensions of those relationships while

38
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:38,910
leaving the other dimensions as um,

39
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,460
unsalted as possible.

40
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,990
We want to democratize democracy
is a subordinate guard,

41
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,760
but we do not want to interfere
with the super ordinate. Good.

42
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,090
Any more than necessary.
So that was the,

43
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:58,650
that is a summary Statement
of what we did on Monday.

44
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,000
But to put some fresh on it,

45
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,480
I thought I would walk you through a
couple of examples of what this means when

46
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:10,090
you start actually to apply it.
And I've,

47
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,450
I'm going to talk today
about two such examples.

48
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,640
One could concerns governing children and,

49
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,650
and now that concerns a
governing the workplace. Uh,

50
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,940
and I'm gonna walk you through the kind
of reasoning that gets generated if we

51
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:32,521
try to think about the
exercise of democratizing
these spears of life within the

52
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:38,640
constraints within the constraints,
um,

53
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,080
of democratic justice.

54
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,340
Now I thought it would be good to start
with governing children because on the

55
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:50,361
face of it,

56
00:03:50,361 --> 00:03:55,361
it presents the most difficult challenge
for the argument that I sketch it on

57
00:03:56,421 --> 00:03:57,830
Monday.
Namely,

58
00:03:57,831 --> 00:04:02,150
if you want to have some notion
of collective self governance,

59
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,480
uh,

60
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,330
that is that people have a presumptive
say when power is exercised over them.

61
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,640
How's that going to work with children?
And if you want to,

62
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,550
if you want to have some notion of,
of opposition,

63
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,880
how's that going to work with children?
This after all, we don't want, uh,

64
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,820
simply mindless opposition.
We want loyal opposition,

65
00:04:25,821 --> 00:04:27,530
we want informed opposition,

66
00:04:27,531 --> 00:04:31,280
but young children are incapable of that.

67
00:04:31,281 --> 00:04:35,960
They started me capable up opposition,
but not exactly the opposition,

68
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,730
uh,
that we're looking for.

69
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:43,030
So if you want to say that democratic
justice should a pow apply in all domains

70
00:04:44,361 --> 00:04:45,890
where power is exercised,

71
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:51,190
this looks like a pretty hard case and
I think it presents unique challenges.

72
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:54,230
For one thing,

73
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,630
the hierarchies that exist
of a children are inevitable.

74
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,470
And so we have to think about
the opposition side, uh,

75
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,270
of democratic justice in a way
that takes that into account.

76
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,700
On the governance side too,

77
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:15,910
we're dealing with a situation where
it's impossible for children to make

78
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:20,390
decisions about their own,
um,

79
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,230
lives. And certainly from
at the very beginning, ah,

80
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:29,020
there's are going to have to
make those decisions for them.

81
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,360
So on the governance side of the equation,
John Locke had this,

82
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:39,200
I think exactly right
when he said that. Um, we,

83
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,700
the only basis for disenfranchising
people is necessity.

84
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,180
So if somebody is unable to participate,

85
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,910
then they should be
deprived of the franchise.

86
00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:00,100
But only to the extent that requires.
So for lock,

87
00:06:00,101 --> 00:06:05,101
he said children should be disenfranchised
for their ignorant non age and once

88
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:09,110
that expires they should
be and franchised.

89
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:14,150
And he also thought that,
um, with respect to adults,

90
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,360
we shouldn't disenfranchise
people until absolutely necessary.

91
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:25,520
So, um, we showed an we
might perhaps we would,

92
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,790
we find it necessary to take away people's
driving licenses once they turn 85 or

93
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:36,780
at least start subjecting them
to annual driving tests. Um,

94
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,480
but that doesn't necessarily mean we
would take away the vote from them. So,

95
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,370
um, the, the, the Loc
basic Locky and impulse is,

96
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,263
um,

97
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:52,420
is only to disenfranchise when necessary
and no more than is required by

98
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:56,360
circumstances.
Um,

99
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,980
now that two presents something of a
challenge when you started to think about

100
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:05,180
children because if you read some
books on the history of childhood,

101
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:10,181
one of the things you will
quickly discover is that
over the past hundred years

102
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:15,050
or so, there's been a huge
lengthening of childhood.

103
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,690
We have invented adolescence.

104
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:22,640
It's adolescence is not a category
that existed a hundred years ago.

105
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:23,660
Um,

106
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,660
children with ought to be miniature
adults at a much earlier stage.

107
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:34,330
So if we have lengthened childhood
length and the time at which people are

108
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:37,460
disenfranchised after all,
uh,

109
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:42,610
the incidence of adulthood begin to accrue
around 16 and 17 when people can get

110
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:47,840
driving license and so on, they
can vote now at 18. Uh, but,

111
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,600
uh, the, the, you know, we
still prohibit, uh, the, uh,

112
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:57,640
imbibing of alcohol until
21. Um, so it's a very,

113
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:02,540
it's a, it's a gradual exited to
adulthood and it's an elongated status.

114
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,090
Now, there might be justification
for that when you move from a,

115
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,600
an economy that's based on physical Bron,
uh,

116
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,680
to an information based economy
that's based on education.

117
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,980
It may be necessary to lengthen childhood
because it may be necessary for people

118
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,710
to acquire different kinds of skills
that were not needed in the 18th or 19th

119
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:32,090
century. So there may be a
justification for lengthening childhood.

120
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,810
Uh, and I'll come back to that,
but it needs to be supplied.

121
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:41,230
The presumption is that you lonely
disenfranchise out of necessity.

122
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:48,160
Now there have been movements from time
to time to treat children as miniature

123
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:53,240
adults from the earliest possible age.

124
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,890
It's a famous British school,

125
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:00,370
Summerhill founded by a man
called a s Neil who died recently.

126
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,670
And Summerhill was famous
for not having any rules.

127
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,360
Uh, and the kids could
do whatever they wanted.

128
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,530
They could go to class or not go to class.

129
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,060
They could go to bed whenever they wanted.
They could come and go.

130
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:20,020
They simply were no
rules. Uh, and, and, um,

131
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,310
Neil use this as an example. Uh, it was,

132
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:28,290
it was always held up as a banner by
the children's rights movement as an

133
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:32,420
example, uh, of what could
be done. And, and the,

134
00:09:32,421 --> 00:09:37,421
the implicit argument against authority
or authority restructures over children

135
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:39,480
from a very young age.

136
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,050
But I think it was rather
artificial because after all,

137
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:47,250
Summer Hill Hill was a private
school, um, where they're well to do,

138
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:51,150
could send it children or what in England
is euphemistically called a public

139
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:55,870
school, which means a private
school. Um, and it, it,

140
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,840
it was cocooned environment with where
children could make mistakes without

141
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:05,650
suffering horrendous consequences
of those mistakes. Whereas if,

142
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,810
if you go down, uh, you know, to, uh,

143
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:13,950
the hill district of new haven and you
imagine 11 and 12 year old children

144
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:18,630
making the sorts of mistakes that you
could make in Summer Hill school without

145
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:23,280
consequence for those kids in the
hill district of new haven, uh,

146
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,860
the,
the results would be life changing,

147
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:30,000
Lee catastrophic and often are so,
um,

148
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,570
the summer hill story is
I think in that sense,

149
00:10:33,571 --> 00:10:38,571
naive about the larger context of power
relations within which education takes

150
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:41,634
place.

151
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,760
And as we'll see even more explicitly
when I come to talk about the democracy in

152
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:49,290
the workplace, um, you never,

153
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:53,160
you always have to look both at the
system of power relations within an

154
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:57,960
institution,
but then also the larger power context,

155
00:10:57,961 --> 00:11:00,390
the power externalities as I call them,

156
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,490
within which the institution operates.
And so,

157
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,383
um,

158
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,000
I think the Lockian impulse to have a,
a gradual,

159
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,043
um,

160
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,360
a gradual transition to
adulthood makes sense.

161
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,330
And it should be bounded by necessity,

162
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:26,331
which creates a presumption that if
we're going to lengthen this period of

163
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:30,780
dependency,
the justification has to be supplied.

164
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,280
Um, so that, that's on the,

165
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:37,380
on the governance side of the equation.

166
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:39,780
What about on the opposition
side of the equation?

167
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:44,340
Because children don't have the capacity
to engage in what we're thinking of

168
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,240
opposition. That is opposition
where you have internalized and,

169
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:52,470
and understood the values of the
system into which you were born.

170
00:11:52,471 --> 00:11:56,980
And now you are questioning whether
they should be applied into the future.

171
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,203
Um,

172
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:04,710
there's not going to be much opposition
either of that sword until children are

173
00:12:05,271 --> 00:12:06,760
fairly advanced.

174
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,120
So there's gonna be a very long period
in which neither collective self

175
00:12:12,471 --> 00:12:17,230
governance nor loyal opposition is
going to be in any meaningful sense,

176
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:22,530
feasible children are going to be stuck
in hierarchical situations and we would,

177
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:27,940
that is a basic material with
which we have to work. Uh,

178
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,050
how can we think about that?
Well,

179
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,160
one argument that comes to mind once
we've considering inevitably hierarchical

180
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:44,310
situations is that perhaps
hierarchies can check one another.

181
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,870
If you have an error, inevitably
hierarchical relationship. Um,

182
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,510
and you think about, uh, more
than one hierarchy. This is,

183
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,420
is this as if you like
another version of ambition,

184
00:12:58,421 --> 00:13:03,320
counteracting ambition. You
create more than one, um,

185
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,940
authority structure over children,
uh,

186
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,440
with the expectation that they
can then to some degree have,

187
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,280
um,

188
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,280
competing and to some degree complimentary
competencies and we'll check one

189
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:18,461
another.

190
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:23,461
And that's the basic approach that I
take in thinking about democratic justice

191
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,830
as it applies to children.

192
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:32,610
We can think of children first of
all as having two kinds of interests,

193
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,960
which I call basic interests
and best interests.

194
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,560
So basic interests are rather like
roles as resources in that sense.

195
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:49,261
My argument is a resources
argument comparable to roses
and a Amartya Sen sends,

196
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,190
which we didn't have time to talk about.
And Ronald Dworkin,

197
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,780
which I mentioned to you briefly and
if you go back to your notes from our

198
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:01,690
lecture on roles,
you'll see that I

199
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:08,250
said one of his most important innovations
was to take the focus off welfare and

200
00:14:09,171 --> 00:14:14,110
therefore different measures of
utility and start instead talking about

201
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:17,830
resources. In his case,
they were primary goods.

202
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,490
So I talk about basic institutions,

203
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:26,570
a basic resources or basic interests
as those things which it's necessary to

204
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:32,521
vindicate in order for the person to
survive and thrive in the economy as it's

205
00:14:34,151 --> 00:14:36,790
likely to exist for their lifetime.

206
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,330
And in the political system
governed as a democracy.

207
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,720
Children have an interest in their basic
interests being met and others have an

208
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:50,590
interest in the basic interests
of children being met.

209
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,840
We all have an interest in the F in the
raising of literate competent people so

210
00:14:57,381 --> 00:14:58,214
that,
um,

211
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:03,610
they can participate in the democratic
political order in which we're all going

212
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:09,050
to operate. And then best interests
or something quite different.

213
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,880
The best interests of
children, um, are to,

214
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:17,600
to thrive as well as possible to
be all they can be, to be happy,

215
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:21,260
fulfilled, successful human beings, um,

216
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,690
loved and capable of love.

217
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:28,400
And all of the other things that we think
of that it's important for children to

218
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:30,530
develop.
Um,

219
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:37,230
and the argument is that we should think
of this state as the ultimate five do

220
00:15:37,841 --> 00:15:42,841
Seri of children's basic interest and
parents as the ultimate fight Ucra of

221
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:48,770
children's best interest. This raises
the question, what is a fiduciary?

222
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:54,620
Goodness. This, this comes from
Loc. When thinking about children,

223
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,850
that lock makes the argument,
uh,

224
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:02,900
when he's discussing
children, he says, well, um,

225
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:08,030
I'll put it into 20th century
term words or 21st century words.

226
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:13,031
But the basic idea is what
do you do if you know you,

227
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:19,010
you raise your child, you do your
best for them, you, you, you know,

228
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,260
or resources into them.

229
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:25,790
You pour energy and affection and to them
you do everything right and they turn

230
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:30,350
around at the age 18 and they say,
you know, your kid says you dad,

231
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:34,730
I think you're a schmuck. I'm Outta
here. I don't know you anything. Um,

232
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,580
I knew starts slamming your
fist on the table. You say,

233
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,210
after all I've done for you. Dot Dot, dot.

234
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,710
Locke wants to say this
argument doesn't fly.

235
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,600
Why doesn't that fly?

236
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:53,250
Why doesn't it apply after
all I've done for you?

237
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,520
What's wrong with that argument
as a basis for thinking about

238
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,100
what children are their parents?

239
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,220
You could take this from a [inaudible]
point of view or our roles.

240
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:11,460
The end point of view thing. Why? Why
is it, why is it a terrible argument?

241
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,220
I've done these things for you now.

242
00:17:14,221 --> 00:17:18,870
You owe it to me to go to law
school or whatever. You guys,

243
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:23,400
uh, support me in my, in
my all day. Any guesses?

244
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,833
Yeah.

245
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,480
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

246
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,451
Well,

247
00:17:36,451 --> 00:17:40,830
the child has no choice to participate
in the power structure that it's been in

248
00:17:40,831 --> 00:17:42,540
for the past 18 or so years.

249
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,440
Exactly. So, and for Loc
obligation is based on consent,

250
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,580
social contract theory, right? Yeah.

251
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:54,480
So you've got a ride that's locks reason.
And so he says,

252
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,670
if your child at the age of 18 says,

253
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,880
you're a Schmuck, I'm outta
here. I don't know anything. I'm,

254
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,350
all you can really do is conclude
that you've failed as a parent.

255
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,550
The child doesn't owe you
anything because, and as I said,

256
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:16,380
it enrolls in terms the fact that this
child is your child is from the child's

257
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:16,921
point of view,

258
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:21,390
morally arbitrary they did and
do anything to become your child.

259
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,760
Right? So your, your risks,

260
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,900
your power and authority over the
child is the power or authority of a

261
00:18:27,901 --> 00:18:30,330
fiduciary.
But it's in the nature of a fight.

262
00:18:30,331 --> 00:18:34,680
Ucra arrangement that the child
doesn't owe the fiduciary anything,

263
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,600
right?
You're huge.

264
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:40,590
You elected to have that child
and you internalize the risk,

265
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:45,180
um, that, that might happen
when the child turned 18.

266
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,360
So Locke says, you know,
you're basically out of luck.

267
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:53,010
What you can do is threatened to
disinherit them, but that's about it.

268
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,390
Um,

269
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:59,100
and indeed I think that might be the best
argument for allowing inherited wealth

270
00:18:59,101 --> 00:19:02,490
ever devised, uh, that
this no other way for,

271
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:07,050
for parents to control their children.
But in any event,

272
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:10,580
short of that, you're out of
luck. Okay. So that's the Nate,

273
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,740
the notion of a fiduciary relationship.
The,

274
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,800
the charge does not owe anything to
the five use airy and it the fight.

275
00:19:20,001 --> 00:19:20,401
Do Sarah,

276
00:19:20,401 --> 00:19:25,401
we relationships persists only as long
as the charges in capable of exercising

277
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:32,610
that authority for themself.
So why,

278
00:19:32,611 --> 00:19:36,500
think of the state as having,
um,

279
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,100
authority of a fight,

280
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:42,960
use area authority of a basic interests
and the parents having fiduciary

281
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:46,020
authority over best interest?
Well,

282
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:50,400
one reason going in is what I've already
mentioned that once you think of an

283
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,460
inevitably hierarchical situation to
some degree you want to have hierarchies.

284
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:02,070
Checking one another,
ambition counteracting ambition.

285
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,890
But it's not, it's not just that, it's
more than that. If you think about, um,

286
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,030
basic interests, um, these
have to do with survival, um,

287
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,780
basic medical care and so on.

288
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:21,020
Whereas where as best interests
have to do with the sorts of things,

289
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:26,270
it would be absurd to think the state
would be any good at knowing your child,

290
00:20:27,121 --> 00:20:31,620
child, caring deeply about your
child, wanting your child to survive,

291
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:35,610
having what we called Olia
interdependent utilities, um,

292
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:38,850
that it connected to your
child's welfare and thriving.

293
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:43,920
Those are not things that can come
from government officials almost by

294
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:48,600
definition because they involve
things like care and affection. Um,

295
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,320
and all of the,

296
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,320
the things that make a a s make
for the super abundant good,

297
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:01,480
uh, of, of rearing a happy
child to have been realized.

298
00:21:01,481 --> 00:21:06,340
And one of the indeed when you think about
what is it that we think of as tragic

299
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:11,520
when a child winds up in it being raised
in an orphanage is precisely that,

300
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,780
that that is missing,
that they,

301
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:16,600
they're being raised by people
who are not into kick to,

302
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:20,860
do not cap passionately and
intimately about them. Um,

303
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:26,010
so you can see why it would make obvious
and intuitive sense to think of parents

304
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,850
as the guardians of, um, if I'd use Eri,

305
00:21:30,851 --> 00:21:35,390
guardians of Children's best
interests. Why should the state, uh,

306
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,570
be the fied usury guardian of the basic
interests apart from the fact that we

307
00:21:40,571 --> 00:21:44,260
don't want us have one hierarchy?
Well,

308
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:49,270
there's certain kinds of things parents
might choose to do out of convictions

309
00:21:49,271 --> 00:21:54,271
about children's best interests that have
an impact on their capacity to survive

310
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,500
and thrive,
um,

311
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:01,300
as members of a democratic policy polity.
And as able,

312
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:07,260
as able to function in the economic
system as it's likely do exist for their

313
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:12,730
lifetime.
The Amish chose in a famous case,

314
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,620
Wisconsin versus Yoda.

315
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:19,480
They wanted to keep their kids
out of school after age 14.

316
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:24,990
Even though the state of Wisconsin through
its democratic mechanisms had decided

317
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:31,590
that you really need to go to school to
the age of age 16 in order to learn the

318
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:36,040
skills necessary to participate
in the political order.

319
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:40,030
And it's in the economy as it's
likely to exist for your lifetime.

320
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:44,860
The Amish didn't dispute that,
but what they said was,

321
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:50,130
we have learned from experience that if
we allow our kids to go to school after

322
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:55,960
age 14, the odds that they will
leave the Amish community go way up.

323
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,750
Well, that's not a good argument, uh,

324
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:03,130
for allowing them to prevent
their kids getting an education.

325
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:08,610
And so I think the Supreme Court
made the wrong choice when it agreed,

326
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:10,210
uh,

327
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:15,210
with the parents in that case or think
of a different one where Christian

328
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:20,791
scientists are of the view that a child
in need of a blood transfusion shouldn't

329
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:23,770
get it because of their religious beliefs.

330
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,210
And this is a case again where
I would argue eventually,

331
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:33,250
um, if you can persuade them,
the parents should lose the, the,

332
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,990
the state has an,

333
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:40,020
has a fide use Eri obligation to the
child to allow it to survive and not

334
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:48,620
suffer the consequences of
not having a life saving, uh,

335
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,940
transformed, um, uh, blood transfusion.

336
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:57,410
On the other hand, there are, there
are other cases we could talk about,

337
00:23:57,411 --> 00:23:58,310
for instance,

338
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:03,950
parents might object and have objected
to certain kinds of books being used in

339
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:10,811
the schools that where the goal is to
promote literacy on the grounds that they

340
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:16,571
object to the moral message within in
the books and they go to court and they

341
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:22,001
challenge the use of certain kinds of
books that convey moral messages that the

342
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:27,100
parents find objectionable.
And in cases like that, um,

343
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:31,760
the burden should fall to the school
district to show there's some other way

344
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:36,410
that, to show that there isn't some other
way they could meet their obligation to

345
00:24:36,411 --> 00:24:41,300
teach literacy that didn't infringe
on the parent's best interests,

346
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,540
uh,
conception of the child's best interests,

347
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,820
which includes their moral education.
So in those kinds of cases,

348
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,470
the parents should win.

349
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,550
There will sometimes be murky cases.

350
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:00,110
There will sometimes be
disagreements about, um,

351
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:06,100
whether or not the state is vindicating
the basic interests in a way that's as

352
00:25:06,861 --> 00:25:08,690
inobtrusive as possible,

353
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:13,590
as the parent's capacity to
meet the best interest. And I,

354
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:18,650
I think you have to create procedural
mechanisms in which those disagreements

355
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,530
are played out.
Uh,

356
00:25:21,531 --> 00:25:26,150
and much of that chapter that I had you
read for today is concerned with what

357
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:29,780
those procedural mechanisms might be.

358
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,370
It's also the case that
it might change over time.

359
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,140
So for example,

360
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,320
we might initially think that things
like sex education belong in the area of

361
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:47,050
best interest because of the
soft girl has to do with, um,

362
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,070
the system of morality that apparent
wants to communicate to their child.

363
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:56,390
Um,
and you have the pluralism of values.

364
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,660
Different parents have different
value systems and that's um,

365
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,530
understood and therefore we don't want,
um,

366
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:09,730
one moral code to be forced on all
children about matters of sexual morality.

367
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,830
And that could be the
status quo for a long time.

368
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:21,190
But then along comes aids and suddenly
sexual morality becomes a public health

369
00:26:23,661 --> 00:26:24,494
matter.

370
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:29,590
And so it then may we cast how we would
think about the division of [inaudible]

371
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,720
area authority between parents and
the state over the sexual education of

372
00:26:38,511 --> 00:26:43,010
children. And because it pumps
up public health issue, um,

373
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:48,470
it may be the case that one would insist
on certain kinds of sex education,

374
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,210
uh,
going on in the schools,

375
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:56,450
although it would have to be designed
to be as inobtrusive intrusive as

376
00:26:56,551 --> 00:27:01,170
possible, uh, of the parents conception
of the children's best interest.

377
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:06,390
And they'll tussle about
that, they'll disagree about
it, they'll go to court. Um,

378
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,523
but it's,
uh,

379
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:12,450
that is a healthy tousle from the point
of view of the larger conception of

380
00:27:12,451 --> 00:27:17,451
democratic justice because really what
you want to do is have a system in which

381
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,180
both hierarchical orders,

382
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:26,390
namely the parental fiduciary order and
the public fiduciary theory order are to

383
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:30,290
some extent held accountable,
uh,

384
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,110
and checked by the claims of one another.

385
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,050
And so, um, this is,

386
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,080
this is one institutional model and it's
actually not that different from the

387
00:27:42,631 --> 00:27:47,190
one that, that exists in the US today.
When you, when you think about it that,

388
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,353
um,

389
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:53,040
the state does reserve authority over
children's basic interests and when

390
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,270
parents become physically abusive
or endanger the life of a child,

391
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:01,200
we will step in and do something.

392
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:06,240
But short of that, um, for,
for many very good reasons,

393
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,020
uh,

394
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:12,020
we leave the parent to decide the
best interest of the child immune from

395
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,220
interference by the state.

396
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:18,750
And we try to create mechanisms
that limit the ways in which,

397
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,880
if I do, sorry, uh, interest
of the state of indicated. Um,

398
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,900
so it was to allow the freest
possible hand of course,

399
00:28:27,901 --> 00:28:31,280
the huge areas of controversy with this.
Um,

400
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:36,030
because often the state will delegate
its authority over basic interest of

401
00:28:36,031 --> 00:28:40,320
parents and so we'll allow private
schools and that sort of thing.

402
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,360
And then we have to manage the result
and um, knock on effects of that,

403
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,520
uh, when the, when the school system
fails, uh, or it doesn't, uh, it,

404
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:55,090
it, it teaches things that are in
at fundamental odds with the, uh,

405
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,200
with the principles of
a democratic society.

406
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,290
And those sorts of
tensions are inevitable.

407
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:03,870
Once you have a dual regime system.

408
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,950
And you need to create mechanisms,
whether it's courts, war,

409
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,160
systems of administrative appeal,
uh,

410
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,640
or whatever it might be in
which these parties can, um,

411
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,610
check one another and
hold them to account.

412
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,490
Because the state has so much more power.

413
00:29:23,491 --> 00:29:28,470
I argue the burden should often
be, uh, adjusted accordingly.

414
00:29:28,471 --> 00:29:33,420
And it should be easier for parents to
challenge what public officials do than

415
00:29:33,421 --> 00:29:35,760
the other way around.
Uh,

416
00:29:35,761 --> 00:29:40,761
and so you get into find nuances of
institutional design that are intended to

417
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:47,050
accommodate the basic power disparities.
But so that's,

418
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,000
that is if you like a,
a,

419
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:54,030
an adapted Lockian view of how one would
think about governance over children

420
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,530
that is modified by the,

421
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,040
the principles of democratic justice.

422
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:07,030
Let's switch and talk
about employment relations.

423
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,280
Very different world.

424
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:13,420
We're now dealing with competent
adults who are presumed

425
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,150
to know their own interests.
We don't need to have a fight,

426
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:24,080
use area arrangements and paternalistic
judgments and wall. And we,

427
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:29,170
we can imagine a system in which everybody
takes care of their own interests.

428
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,780
Now, if you think about
the governance of the firm,

429
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,370
as I said, uh, firms are
hierarchical organizations,

430
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:43,780
um, in which employees have to
do what employers tell them.

431
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:48,670
Uh,
this is generally thought to be efficient.

432
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,070
There are debates about whether,

433
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,053
MMM,

434
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,080
firms are too hierarchical.
If they become too high rocket called,

435
00:30:58,081 --> 00:31:02,790
they may become less efficient.
And indeed in the 1960s and seventies,

436
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,170
there was a, there was a, uh,

437
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:10,420
a movement trying to argue
that democratically run
firms would be more efficient

438
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:16,800
than hierarchically ordered firms.
Huge literature on that.

439
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:21,120
Uh, but the best book on the subject
was written by Henry Hansman.

440
00:31:21,121 --> 00:31:24,180
Now in the Yale law school. Um, my book,

441
00:31:24,181 --> 00:31:27,570
which I commend to you all called
the ownership of enterprise,

442
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:32,850
which I discussed some in that chapter,
uh, on democracy in the workplace.

443
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,650
And hansman pointed out that
if democratically run firms,

444
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,300
we're more efficient,

445
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:44,610
we would have seen them emerge
all over the economy, right? If,

446
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:47,250
if democratically run
firms were more efficient,

447
00:31:47,251 --> 00:31:50,010
they would have out competed
the hierarchical firm.

448
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,013
MMM.

449
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,470
And indeed in the sixties and seventies,

450
00:31:55,770 --> 00:32:00,770
part of the reason people made those
arguments was they observed that Japanese

451
00:32:01,261 --> 00:32:04,980
firms were much less
hierarchical than American firms.

452
00:32:04,981 --> 00:32:07,740
And also they thought they
were much more efficient.

453
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,040
They will all these studies showing,
you know,

454
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:14,220
Japanese car firms had
three layers of management,

455
00:32:14,221 --> 00:32:19,110
whereas American carm firms had seven
layers of management and Japanese cars

456
00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:20,640
firms.
We're more efficient.

457
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:26,090
That didn't look so good after the 1990s
rolled in and Japanese firms turned out

458
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:28,800
not to be very efficient at all.

459
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,240
There was similar arguments about, um, uh,

460
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:38,450
what a Ph to be democratic firms in a
part of Italy called monitor gone that was

461
00:32:38,761 --> 00:32:42,190
thought be very efficient.
But,

462
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:47,230
but a subsequent studies showed that
actually these firms were not very

463
00:32:48,081 --> 00:32:48,761
democratic,

464
00:32:48,761 --> 00:32:53,761
critically run at all and they were
basically controlled by the banks that

465
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:58,970
controlled there, um, capitol. And so, um,

466
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:03,650
it was a rather naive to
expect democratic, uh,

467
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:07,370
firms to be efficient.
And indeed,

468
00:33:07,371 --> 00:33:09,380
as Henry Hansman points out,

469
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:13,610
you only really find that
democratic firms are efficient

470
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:18,340
in circumstances where everybody has,

471
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:23,380
can do every job like law firms or taxi
cab companies or plywood cooption and

472
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,280
northeastern, Northwestern us, um,

473
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,460
where everybody has an
interchangeable role,

474
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:35,870
then democracy doesn't come
at any cost to efficiency.

475
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:40,760
Um, this is a combination of the
ancient ruling and being ruled.

476
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:45,380
In turn, if we can all do everything
right, we can all we can, we can,

477
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,520
uh, be egalitarian about it. And, um,

478
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,290
the Buchanan and Telec observation that
I talked to you about earlier, namely,

479
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:59,291
when we have disagreements and you create
a lot of procedure that will be time

480
00:34:00,531 --> 00:34:04,220
consuming, be precisely
because we have disagreements,

481
00:34:04,221 --> 00:34:05,390
we have different interests.

482
00:34:05,391 --> 00:34:10,391
So hansman says in large firms or firms
where you have old workers and young

483
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:15,200
workers, they'll have very different
interests on things like pensions.

484
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:20,120
Young workers were one, one thing, old
workers, well, one, something else. Um,

485
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,170
and if you start to have a lot of
democratic procedure in those kinds of

486
00:34:24,171 --> 00:34:25,070
circumstances,

487
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:29,090
it's going to come at an efficiency cost
because they're going to be sitting in

488
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:33,440
meetings all day arguing about their
pension benefits and not working on the

489
00:34:33,441 --> 00:34:34,274
assembly line.

490
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:39,410
So it's not surprising hansman
saves that in most industries.

491
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:39,981
In fact,

492
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:44,450
you do not get democratic
firms for efficiency reasons.

493
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,450
Efficiency is the superordinate good,
right?

494
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,870
Firms have there to produce goods
and services that make money. Uh,

495
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,390
and if you don't do it efficiently,

496
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:57,500
we'll be more efficiently than the
next person you're going to go out of

497
00:34:57,501 --> 00:35:02,000
business. So from the point
of view of pure efficiency,

498
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,373
mmm.

499
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:09,030
It seems like you're not going to
get a lot of democracy in the firm.

500
00:35:09,031 --> 00:35:13,170
That's the cold, harsh reality
from this perspective of 2010.

501
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:18,710
And the literature advocating democratic
firms has this kind of come by our

502
00:35:20,101 --> 00:35:21,630
quality that,
um,

503
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,290
it's difficult to take seriously
in the contemporary world.

504
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:30,720
Firms are going to be hierarchical,
then we have the problem. Well,

505
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:35,870
so how should we think about the
hierarchies within firms given the that,

506
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:39,920
okay.

507
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,753
MMM.

508
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:48,650
Given the fact that they are sites of
greatly unequal distribution of power.

509
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:54,660
So different players
have different options.

510
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:59,370
For instance, if you, and this is
where I would disagree with hand Smith,

511
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,830
if you,
if you're a shareholder

512
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,830
in a firm and you don't
like what the firm is doing,

513
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,430
you have a very easy option,
right?

514
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,690
You can just sell your shares and buy
shares and another firm, right? Yeah,

515
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,380
no problem there. All right. And so, um,

516
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,850
Hansman says we should think of
shareholders as enforcing democratic

517
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:29,530
accountability and firms. I don't think
that's a very plausible way to go.

518
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:34,270
Um, because shareholders
have very low exit costs.

519
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:37,720
Um, you simply, you don't
like the way a farm is wine.

520
00:36:37,721 --> 00:36:40,660
You buy shares in a different firm.

521
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:44,920
They're not going to exercise
much democratic control
of what goes on within the

522
00:36:44,921 --> 00:36:49,500
firm.
Think about employees in a firm.

523
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:55,110
Well,
it depends a lot on the situation.

524
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,480
So just to fix intuitions,
consider this,

525
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,480
why do I talk about a surface paradise?

526
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,930
The Belgian political philosophy.
Um,

527
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:14,050
Phillip Farm per race wrote a book called
Real Freedom for all in which he said,

528
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:19,730
um, it's a kind of post roles in
book about Justice Fund per rice.

529
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:24,970
He writes, he run something by the way,
called the basic income network. Um,

530
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,490
which I urge you to take a look at
this website. It's quite interesting.

531
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:33,500
He basically says everybody should
be paid the highest sustainable wage

532
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,820
regardless of work.

533
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,050
This is sort of Sweden on
crack or something. Okay.

534
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:44,010
Everybody should be paid. The
highest, even surface should be paid.

535
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:47,690
That's on per Rice's
view that everybody is.

536
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:51,210
In European parlance,
it's called the social way.

537
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:55,770
They should have the highest
social wage possible. Okay?

538
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,760
So imagine that that's a surface paradise.

539
00:37:59,761 --> 00:38:03,540
This is the utopia on per race.
Just friends in that book.

540
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:08,541
Real freedom for all think at
the other end of a continuum,

541
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:11,670
what we might call a Dickensian nightmare.

542
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:15,600
A world in which there's
no health insurance,

543
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,050
no unemployment insurance,

544
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:23,640
no welfare state, no
social security, nothing,

545
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,313
okay?

546
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:30,590
So obviously every actual economy exists
somewhere on this continuum from the

547
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:36,280
Dickensian nightmare to this,
to the paradise.

548
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:41,940
And so what I want to say as well that
affects a lot of what goes on within the

549
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:43,144
firm

550
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,640
because

551
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,470
if we are living in a
Dickensian nightmare,

552
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,030
go back to the example
I mentioned last time.

553
00:38:55,330 --> 00:39:00,330
Thank you for an employer
who's in a hierarchical
relationship with as secretary

554
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:04,690
and says to the secretary,
unless you go to bed with me,

555
00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:06,250
I'm going to make sure you get fired.

556
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:12,830
So now an employer is abusing
the position in the hierarchy,

557
00:39:13,031 --> 00:39:17,440
right? Well, if this is
a Dickensian nightmare,

558
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,570
the secretary is going to be terrified

559
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,780
because the costs,

560
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,180
I'm losing that job on enormous,

561
00:39:27,181 --> 00:39:30,420
going to lose their health insurance is
no unemployment, et Cetera, et Cetera,

562
00:39:30,421 --> 00:39:33,900
et cetera. You're going
to be thrown out into, um,

563
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:40,090
a pretty horrible cauldron if
you're living in a surface.

564
00:39:40,091 --> 00:39:45,091
Paradise secretary can just can walk away,

565
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,480
right at much lower cost to themselves.

566
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,680
And I'm not talking about
the question whether this,

567
00:39:54,681 --> 00:39:58,670
this the secretary is actually
fired or actually walks away,

568
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:04,360
but simply the knowledge both parties
have that that in the Dickensian nightmare

569
00:40:06,651 --> 00:40:09,770
that the exit cost for the
secretary of our enormous,

570
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:15,140
whereas in the surface paradise, the exit
costs for the secretary, I'm very low,

571
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:19,310
right. That structures the
power relations within the firm.

572
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,610
So the basic intuition here
is when we ask the question,

573
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:30,930
how much should the state regulate?
What goes on in firms?

574
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,720
The answer is, well, it depends.

575
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:38,490
It depends upon where you
are on this continuum.

576
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:45,200
Because if you're closer
to a surface paradise,

577
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:50,230
there's rec last reason for the state to
create lots of protections for workers

578
00:40:50,901 --> 00:40:51,980
within the firm,

579
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:57,170
which are going to come at an
efficiency cost by assumption, right?

580
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:03,410
Appeals Processes, defenses,
Defense of union rights,

581
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,120
grievance procedures,

582
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,560
burden shifting to employers
when there are disputes,

583
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:12,590
all of that comes at an efficiency cost,
right?

584
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:19,160
But so the notion is that if
it's a Dickensian nightmare,

585
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,470
the work is basic
interests are threatened,

586
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,413
then

587
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:30,730
democratic justice would not say the
workers should internalize those costs.

588
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,660
We added the employer. Should, but
you move towards a surface paradise,

589
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:40,070
then there's more reason to say that,
um,

590
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:44,570
the worker can internalize some of the
costs of hierarchy in the firm because

591
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:48,770
the costs of leaving a
comparatively smaller.

592
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,740
And so you have, uh, as I said,

593
00:41:51,741 --> 00:41:56,741
a semi contextual argument what this
regime should be like depends on the power

594
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:02,500
externalities within which the power
internal realities of the firm actually

595
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,520
take place.

596
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:10,490
And one of the desirable
features of this I think is, um,

597
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,260
that it,
it leads,

598
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:16,760
leads you to rethink relationship
between capital and labor.

599
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:22,040
You know, Mark's thought that's the
basic conflict work as on one side,

600
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:24,260
capital on the other.
But now if you think,

601
00:42:24,261 --> 00:42:26,780
say about something like health insurance,

602
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:31,340
we have a system now where health
insurance is provided through employment,

603
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,630
which moved moves you in more than a
Dickensian nightmare direction, right?

604
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:40,490
Because you don't use, you lose your job,
you lose your health insurance, right?

605
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:46,160
And employers compete with one
another by offering, you know,

606
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,510
Yale says too,

607
00:42:47,511 --> 00:42:52,511
we off a Betta Betta health benefits
then working for whatever it is,

608
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:56,210
Harvard or, or, um, Columbia.

609
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,710
So employers compete with one another,
right?

610
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:05,950
But the truth is all of the employers
would be better off if there were,

611
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:10,340
if they didn't have to compete in
everybody had health insurance. Right?

612
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:14,780
So there there's a kind of collective
action problem, what looks like,

613
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:20,410
especially once we get into strikes and
bargaining disputes between employees

614
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:21,374
and employers.

615
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:26,410
What looks like a conflict between
capital and labor couldn't be

616
00:43:26,421 --> 00:43:28,730
reconceptualized as what it is really.

617
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:33,140
It's a collective action
problem among firms, right?

618
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,790
They all compete at the margin
over things like benefits.

619
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:41,570
But in fact they would be better off
if health benefits would taken off the

620
00:43:41,571 --> 00:43:45,560
table entirely and funded
through the tax system. Um,

621
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:51,160
so what looks like a conflict between
capital and labor is actually the

622
00:43:52,281 --> 00:43:54,950
collective action problem among firms.

623
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:59,990
And the other advantage of this
I think is that it does not put

624
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:05,240
the best in conflict with
the good in that if you,

625
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:07,640
to the extent you have a regime like this,

626
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:12,940
you give firms the incentive to support
the expansion of the social wage.

627
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:17,210
Because what do,
what do capitalists want?

628
00:44:17,211 --> 00:44:21,770
What a manager's want most, they
want flexibility. At the plant level,

629
00:44:21,771 --> 00:44:25,190
they want to be able to turn on a dime
and lay off people and do something

630
00:44:25,191 --> 00:44:29,660
differently and compete in the
21st century in a totally new way.

631
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,810
Then they will competing two years
before because that's what you need.

632
00:44:33,811 --> 00:44:38,400
The name of the game is flexibility,
adaptability, nimbleness, all that stuff.

633
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:42,630
That's what firms want. That's
what they need, right? And the,

634
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:47,370
if they know that the closer you
you get to a Dickensian nightmare,

635
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:52,410
the more cumbersome regulation they're
going to have and the more you would move

636
00:44:52,411 --> 00:44:55,290
toward the surface paradise,
the last you're going to have.

637
00:44:55,770 --> 00:45:00,770
Then they have an incentive to try and
move the society toward the surface

638
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:03,420
paradise.

639
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:08,420
So corporations will get behind
expansions of health insurance and so on.

640
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:14,420
And there's a certain realism to that
because if you go and study the history of

641
00:45:14,971 --> 00:45:16,860
the expansion of the welfare state,

642
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,680
despite what you might
read in the newspapers,

643
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:24,830
what you will find is it never happens
unless business gets behind it.

644
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:29,610
The big expansions of the social wage,
the big expansions of the welfare state,

645
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:34,820
even in countries like Sweden have only
occurred in circumstances where business

646
00:45:36,001 --> 00:45:38,640
gets behind it and supports it.
So you want,

647
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:44,030
you want an industrial management regime
that distributes the incentives in such

648
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:47,550
a way that they will do it.

649
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:53,620
So those are two examples of how we
can think about democratizing the power

650
00:45:55,351 --> 00:45:58,390
dimensions of,
of uh,

651
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:04,640
social institutions while interfering
with the superordinate goods as little as

652
00:46:05,191 --> 00:46:06,024
possible.

653
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:10,980
And that's the basic impulse of
the argument of democratic justice.

654
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:17,810
If you take a step back and you think
about democracy over the past couple of

655
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:23,160
centuries, you know, we, I talked to
you some about Alexis de Tocqueville.

656
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:27,930
He made two points about democracy.
He had a love hate relationship with it.

657
00:46:27,931 --> 00:46:31,040
I told you he was in
many ways a credit covet,

658
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,520
but he did say two things about it.
One that it was inevitable,

659
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:38,790
the gradual progress if democracy,

660
00:46:38,791 --> 00:46:43,791
he said in the preface to the 1848 edition
of democracy in America is something

661
00:46:45,451 --> 00:46:49,230
faded. It, it's his
providential, I can't be stopped.

662
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,760
And the other thing he said is that the
thing about democracy is it has wild

663
00:46:53,761 --> 00:46:58,650
instincts. What we need to do is try
and domesticate it, not get rid of it.

664
00:46:58,651 --> 00:47:02,910
We can't get rid of it. We can't
stop it. So we must domesticate it.

665
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:07,260
Well, I think both of those
claims were partly correct.

666
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:10,380
It is true.

667
00:47:10,381 --> 00:47:15,381
Tocqueville was correct to think that
democracy is an idea with world historical

668
00:47:16,441 --> 00:47:18,300
force.
Um,

669
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:23,660
it will always be appealed to by people
who experience injustice and they will

670
00:47:25,231 --> 00:47:29,500
always a demand democratization,
um,

671
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:32,830
if they,

672
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:37,330
they find their social set
circumstances on satisfactory.

673
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:40,840
So I think this notion,
uh, is partly right,

674
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:46,710
but even though democracy is an
idea with world historical force,

675
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:52,110
I think he was partly wrong to say that
the progress of democracy is inevitable.

676
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:58,770
There have always been advances
for democracy and then setbacks.

677
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:03,550
Uh, we had this French revolution.
We had a disease state in 1830.

678
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,180
We had a democratic
revolution sweep Europe by,

679
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:12,040
by 1832, the monarchies
had been restored. 1848.

680
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:16,660
Again, we had democratic
revolution sweep Europe. Uh,

681
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:20,530
and by 1851,
they had been undone.

682
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,790
1989,
we had democratic revolutions,

683
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:27,550
huge new wave of democracy.

684
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:32,800
But some of those democracies came
under real threat in places like, uh,

685
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,270
fell apart in

686
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,010
Algeria in 1991.
Uh,

687
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:42,050
we know what happened in Rwanda.
Um,

688
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:45,010
although things have turned
around again since, well,

689
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,060
if we look at Pakistan in the
last three or four years, uh,

690
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,560
we see that,

691
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:55,120
that we shouldn't think of
democracy as inevitable.

692
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:00,480
This sort of Francis Fukuyama idea
that history is to intending in some

693
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:05,290
direction, uh, to the extent
you think democracy is valuable,

694
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:10,030
really what you have to do is
work to promote it and sustain it.

695
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:15,940
Likewise, when we talk about
Tocqueville, second observation,

696
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:21,270
that democracy has wild instincts
and it needs to be reined in a,

697
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:26,910
we need to, as he put it, educate
democracy, uh, to limit its,

698
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,960
it's wild instincts and make sure that
it doesn't destroy other good things.

699
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,250
Superordinate goods.
In his case, of course,

700
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:41,430
freedom was the most important good that
he didn't want democracy to compromise.

701
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:46,450
But I think the same argument
applies with respect to efficiency,

702
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:51,250
with respect to um, many of the
superordinate goods that people

703
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:55,930
strive the after and cherish.

704
00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:01,170
So we always have to be weary of the
capacity of democracy to undermine other

705
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,690
goods. But, and this is where I think
Tocqueville overstated the case,

706
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:11,830
that does not mean we
should overlook democracies,

707
00:50:11,831 --> 00:50:15,430
capacity to undermine
bad things in the world.

708
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,253
Um,

709
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:22,770
to the extent we can democratize power
relations without interfering with

710
00:50:24,281 --> 00:50:28,070
superordinate goods,
we can have a tremendous effect for good.

711
00:50:28,071 --> 00:50:30,770
Whether it's the abolition of slavery,

712
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:34,550
whether it's the limiting of
exploitation in the workplace,

713
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:39,380
whether it's the protection or the
restructuring of the law of marriage to

714
00:50:39,381 --> 00:50:43,040
prevent, um, the domination of women.

715
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:48,250
These are all areas in which the basic
democratic impulse to democratize social

716
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:51,800
relations has improved them.

717
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:56,210
And so it doesn't mean it
will always be successful.

718
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,990
Sometimes it will fail,
requires creative ingenuity,

719
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:04,880
the capacity to try things out and
change them when they don't work.

720
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:05,750
Um,

721
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:10,750
but the basic impulse of democratic
justice is to take inherited institutions,

722
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:16,430
um, democratize them as we
reproduce them into the future,

723
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:19,940
leaving a better world than we found.
Thank you very much.

724
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,550
[inaudible].
