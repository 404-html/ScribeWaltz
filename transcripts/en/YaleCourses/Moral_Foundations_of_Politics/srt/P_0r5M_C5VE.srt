1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:07,080
Okay this morning we are going to have
finished talking about marks and we're

2
00:00:07,081 --> 00:00:12,081
going to focus on the failures of Marxism
and the legacies of Marxism and the

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,190
failures are connected to the legacies
and important ways that will unfold as we

4
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,770
proceed with today's discussion.

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,880
I began this already on Monday by talking
about the difficulties with Marx's

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,730
assumptions about scarcity and super
abundance and we saw that just as male

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,690
couldn't banish politics from the,

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,960
from politics through the mechanism
of a neutral definition of harm.

9
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,750
Mark's is unable to banish politics from
politics by somehow wishing of conflict

10
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,600
could in principle go away.

11
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:59,601
We saw that that notion of super abundance
that informs his communist new Utopia

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,440
is incoherent in principle and that means
that distributive conflict is endemic

13
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:11,070
to human society.

14
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:16,071
No matter how much wealth there is and
some principles for the distribution of

15
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,700
income and wealth are going to have to
be argued about and defended regardless

16
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,770
of what is produced in society or
what could be produced in society.

17
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,700
The second failure of
Marxism as well known,

18
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:35,910
but we should nonetheless mention it,
which is that his,

19
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:40,710
his historical predictions turned out
to be hopelessly wide of the mark.

20
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,100
Not only was he wrong in 1830 and 1848
when he thought the communist revolutions

21
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:49,590
were about to sweep through Europe.
Um,

22
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:54,360
they were both a not communist and
be quickly reversed. In any event,

23
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,180
uh, within a couple of years, um,

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,110
his larger historical predictions were,
were also wrong.

25
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:06,240
He thought Communism would come socialist
revolutions for reasons that you now

26
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:09,270
know because we've worked
through the macro theory,

27
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:14,271
he thought that socialist revolutions
would occur in advanced capitalist systems

28
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:18,510
that had become uncompetitive because
of the replacement of competitive

29
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:23,400
capitalism with, with capitalism,
with monopoly capitalism. And in fact,

30
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:28,401
where we saw revolutions bearing the
Communists label was in peasant societies

31
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:32,970
and in Russia and in China, um, or in,

32
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,440
in eastern Europe,

33
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:38,560
in countries where it was actually more
or less imposed from the outside, um,

34
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,180
by the Soviet Union after World War Two,

35
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:47,181
we didn't really see any
society go through the sort
of path march was thinking

36
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:51,870
of and his larger teleological
theory of history,

37
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,140
namely from feudalism to capitalism
to socialism to communism,

38
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,250
it simply didn't happen.

39
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,850
And as the reversals of the
revolutions of 1830 and 1848,

40
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,360
uh,
remind us on a smaller scale,

41
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:15,740
Mark's is bigger idea that there's some
purpose or direction to history seems

42
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:21,061
questionable by the first
decades of the 21st century.

43
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,660
History doesn't go in a single direction.
Um,

44
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:29,250
and this is a theme to which we
will return, but you can see, um,

45
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:34,350
movements toward more egalitarian
systems and then movements away from

46
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,070
egalitarian systems.

47
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:39,880
You can see democracy created and
then you can see it collapse into

48
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:44,720
authoritarianism so that there
isn't a single TV or logical,

49
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,400
uh,

50
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,400
or direction or focus of history of
the sort that march was looking for.

51
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,760
So on the big,
big predictions,

52
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:59,761
Marxism doesn't look very good from
the vantage point of the 21st century,

53
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,500
but some of his smaller
predictions were also wrong, uh,

54
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:10,210
in ways that in some, some respects
more interesting for our purposes.

55
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,500
And so I'm going to go back through,
um,

56
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,160
some of his arguments and focus on things
that were wrong with those arguments

57
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,630
that we can nonetheless,

58
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:24,631
George some interesting conclusions about
as we go on our way and examining the

59
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:28,150
moral foundations of politics.
And,

60
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,620
and I'm going to start with his macro
theory and talk about some difficulties

61
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:36,520
with that. And then I'm going to go
backwards into the micros theory.

62
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:41,350
So we're doing the reverse, if you
like, of what we did on the way in,

63
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:45,580
we started with the micro theory and we
saw how that generated the macro theory.

64
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,930
Now we're going backwards through the
macro theory and then we will go back into

65
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,260
the labor theory of value
and the assumptions about
workmanship that underlie it

66
00:04:55,691 --> 00:05:00,460
that he took over from Loc and
secularized and modernized. As you know,

67
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,840
so if you'll recall from Monday's lecture
Marxists macro theory was an invisible

68
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:11,140
hand theory like Smith's,

69
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:16,141
except it was a malevolent invisible hand
where a Smith's was a benign invisible

70
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:17,584
hand,

71
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,710
and one element of it was that argument
about the potential for liquidity

72
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:23,980
crises,

73
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,870
that there would be the possibility
that people would hoard money,

74
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,900
that money would stop flowing through
the system and the system would thereby

75
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,530
become sclerotic.
It isn't.

76
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:42,590
It is the case that capitalist systems
have the potential for liquidity crises,

77
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:48,420
but one of the things Mark's greatly
underestimated was the capacity of

78
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:52,540
capitalists states in
capitalist societies,

79
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:57,690
states in capitalist societies to address
things like liquidity crises and other

80
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:00,650
things as well.
We'll see.

81
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,800
It's almost as if he didn't really take
it seriously when he and angles said in

82
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:11,081
the communist manifesto that the state
in capitalist society is the executive

83
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:13,640
committee of the bourgeoisie.

84
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:18,910
He underestimated what the state could
actually do to preserve capitalism.

85
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,030
Um,

86
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:25,030
a good example in the early years of
this system was lik huge liquidity crisis

87
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:27,770
in Mexico where,
uh,

88
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,800
the whole Mexico Mexican economy was
on the verge of complete collapse.

89
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,420
But the western governments led by the,

90
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:41,470
the United States put together a
$50 billion package to resolve that,

91
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:47,260
to pump liquidity into the Mexican
economy until the crisis was over and they

92
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:48,980
succeeded.

93
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:53,980
And so we didn't see the kind of collapse
in the maximum Mexican economy that

94
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:58,370
that liquidity crisis, uh,
had the potential to create.

95
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,730
So the,

96
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,740
the argument about the potential
for liquidity crises is valid,

97
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:09,770
but we have no particular reason
to think they can't be managed.

98
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:14,600
Once the sources of liquidity crises
are understood and governments have the

99
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,420
levers available to
them, uh, that were, uh,

100
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,490
made available to the Mexican
government in, in the, uh,

101
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,290
during the Clinton administration
in the US. Secondly,

102
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,150
Mark's has this argument about the
declining tendency in the rate of profit.

103
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,890
As I said to you,

104
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:38,891
every classical political
economists believe that there
was a declining tendency

105
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:44,000
in the rate of profit in market systems
and they thought one of their jobs was

106
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:45,020
to account for it.

107
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,700
They thought it was definitely the case
that there is this phenomenon and you

108
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:54,200
had to explain why it occurs.
It's in fact,

109
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:58,610
if we look over the long course of
capitalism since the 19th century,

110
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,000
it's far from clear that there
is as an empirical matter,

111
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:06,530
a longterm declining tendency
in the rate of profit.

112
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:11,060
Um, in Marx's case, uh, as you know,

113
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:15,050
his story about the declining tendency
and the rate of profit had to do with the

114
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:19,700
increasing capital intensity
of production that,

115
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:23,730
um,
as capitalists compete by,

116
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,550
uh,

117
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:30,050
relying more and more on what
he calls constant capital.

118
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,470
Um,
there's less and less fresh value created.

119
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:38,471
And so what capitalists entrepreneurs do
at the margin to be more competitive in

120
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:45,230
the long run to more profitable in the
medium run, makes them less profitable.

121
00:08:45,231 --> 00:08:49,310
So the capitalists who puts the Spinning
Jenny and increases his profits in the

122
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:50,144
short run,

123
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,230
but when they're spinning jennies in
every cotton factory in the economy,

124
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,710
the rate of profit is lower than before
the first spinning Jenny had been put in.

125
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:03,711
And Mark's identified that as the basic
dynamic driving the declining tendency

126
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:07,740
in the rate of profit.
Two problems with it.

127
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:08,640
Okay.

128
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,920
One is
that it is,

129
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:16,921
so there's a sort of finite number
of industries because you could say,

130
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,590
you could grant his argument
and say, yeah, it's,

131
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:27,090
it's true that the rate of profit in the
cotton industry will fall as it becomes

132
00:09:27,281 --> 00:09:28,810
more and more capital intensive.

133
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,410
But there are all kinds of new industries
that are going to come into being all

134
00:09:32,411 --> 00:09:33,220
the time.

135
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,220
So capital will flow eventually into other
industries and they'll start out with

136
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,610
big profit margins and then the
profit margins will get competed away.

137
00:09:42,611 --> 00:09:45,010
But then capital level
goes somewhere else.

138
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,870
So unless you have this idea that this
is sort of fixed number of lines of

139
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:50,704
production

140
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:57,650
such that that once profit
start to fall in all of them,

141
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,550
I'm not going gonna fall economy.
Why there's no particular reason,

142
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:06,551
even working from Marx's on premises to
think that has come up with any lasting

143
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:13,241
account of why the rate of profit
would fall in capitalist systems.

144
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:17,480
Moreover,
even putting that problem to one side,

145
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,870
if you think about it,
if it is the case,

146
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:21,740
okay,

147
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,380
even if it is the case
that making capital, uh,

148
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:30,430
pro production more capital intensive
reduces profit margins in the long run.

149
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,773
Nonetheless,

150
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:37,780
if productivity goes up at a more rapid
rate than capital displaces labor in the

151
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,580
production process,

152
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,110
then you wouldn't necessarily
see the right of profit fall.

153
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,040
So if,

154
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,040
if the rate of increase in productivity
exceeds the rate at which capital is

155
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:55,580
displacing label,
put it in Marx's jargon,

156
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,730
constant capitalist,
displacing variable capital,

157
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,910
then there's actually no reason to expect,
um,

158
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,390
the rate of profit to fall.

159
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:10,450
So it all depends on how much more
productive capitol makes Labor.

160
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,480
And there's no theoretical answer to that
question. It's an empirical question.

161
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,970
So, even though I'm Marx thought there
was a declining tendency in the rate of

162
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:24,450
profit,
it's debatable whether in fact there is,

163
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:29,750
and it's certainly not the case that his
theory explained why it should occur.

164
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,530
Okay.

165
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,710
His third argument,
competition,

166
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,570
LM and eight competitors.

167
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:44,010
And because production is becoming
more and more capital intensive,

168
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,650
entry costs are going up and you're not
going to see new people coming into the

169
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:50,484
market.

170
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,170
Okay?

171
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,400
I told the story about,
uh,

172
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,040
NASA and the o rings on the
challenge of blowing up.

173
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,310
There was nobody to come
into the market and, uh, uh,

174
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,000
take over dad's.
So you have a monopoly,

175
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:10,390
not very efficient monopoly producer,
um,

176
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:12,610
uh,

177
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:17,110
who lacks the incentive to innovate and
we have the sorts of problems we saw

178
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,870
that developed with Morton
Thiokol in that instance.

179
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,800
So that's also true,

180
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:27,640
only under a fairly
restrictive set of assumptions,

181
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:31,570
which might not turn out
to be true after all.

182
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,830
There are some industries in which
there are economies of smallness.

183
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,220
Think about apple computers invented
in somebody's garage in California,

184
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,230
um,
you know,

185
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:49,231
completely upending IBM and the big
established capital-intensive computer

186
00:12:51,431 --> 00:12:55,960
firms. Uh, and totally
transforming that market.

187
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,490
So it's not necessarily true.
You know, Mark's had in his mind,

188
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,410
19th century industrial
production, uh, you know,

189
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,010
steelworks cotton factories,
this sort of thing.

190
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,220
But it's a very historically bounded
perception of what it is that goes on in,

191
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:17,140
in,
in economic systems.

192
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:22,410
And there might be all sorts of sectors
in the economy that tend to resist the

193
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:27,451
development of monopolies and in which
there are various economies of smallness

194
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:33,300
that actually lend themselves to
the constant entry of new players,

195
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,530
uh, that he provided. Realizing
the system. And I think the, the,

196
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,400
the information technology
revolution that, uh,

197
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:47,110
of that is accompanied your
generation would be exhibit a in,

198
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,590
uh,
defending that proposition

199
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:58,410
under consumption or sometimes it's said
overproduction obviously means the same

200
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,260
thing.
You know,

201
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:07,261
the way we put it into Marx's sort of
conceptual scheme was the argument that

202
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:11,590
the workers collectively couldn't
buy everything they produced.

203
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,010
A Smith believed that
Ricardo believed that.

204
00:14:15,011 --> 00:14:19,990
Marx believed that an early theories
of imperialism, we're partly,

205
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:25,000
uh, dreamed up in order to
explain that, that, that you get,

206
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:30,001
you get imperialism partly as a result
of the search for new markets to address

207
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:34,230
the endemic weak demand
in capitalist systems.

208
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:38,470
Marks is not the only person who
thought there was endemic weak demand in

209
00:14:38,471 --> 00:14:42,480
capitalist systems.
Indeed, uh, canes, the,

210
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,010
the Great English economist of the
first half of the 20th century. And,

211
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:52,040
and the, the theorist
who's, whose ideas informed,

212
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,330
uh,

213
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:58,330
the policies to end the depression also
thought there was endemic weak demand in

214
00:14:59,581 --> 00:15:03,740
capitalist systems because
of a diminishing marginal
propensity to consume.

215
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,540
Keynes's idea wise, if you have
no money and I give you a dollar,

216
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:12,440
you'll spend it. But if you have
$1 million and I give you a dollar,

217
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,220
you'll save it.
And so when you get into recessions,

218
00:15:16,221 --> 00:15:18,020
the problem is weak demand.

219
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,260
And so you get the Keynesian
answer to a recession.

220
00:15:23,261 --> 00:15:28,261
So depressions is to spend money at
the bottom with governments to do that

221
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:33,080
largely through borrowing. And
this is of course, what a first,

222
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:37,250
the George W.
Bush administration in its final year.

223
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:42,251
And then the Obama administration in
its first year have been doing a classic

224
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,830
Keynesian response to their risks.

225
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,150
The what's now being called the great
recession to prevent it from becoming a

226
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:55,140
great depression, namely the state
borrows money, tries to spend it in,

227
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:00,350
in the parts of the economy that will
stimulate demand and then we'll get the

228
00:16:00,351 --> 00:16:03,650
economy going back up.
So again,

229
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:07,250
this is an example of marches,

230
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,640
chronic underestimation of the capacity
of the state to do things that will

231
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,980
stave off crises or manage crises or
prevent them from becoming catastrophic,

232
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:25,310
really bad. And so, uh, you know,

233
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:30,311
I think we've seen a vivid illustration
of that in the last couple of years.

234
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:33,701
Finally,

235
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:38,470
working class consciousness as all of
these other things were going on and

236
00:16:38,471 --> 00:16:40,240
making the system,
you know,

237
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,710
creek at the joints and become
less and less functional.

238
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,890
Marx thought that,
um,

239
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,610
the workers would start to
become a class for itself.

240
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:56,200
The workers would start to see that
they were getting ripped off and,

241
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,290
uh, get angry about it, become mobilized.

242
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:04,291
And militant and reached the point where
they believe that they had nothing to

243
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,640
lose,
but they're chains.

244
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:15,420
Now there are two problems with
that. One, we already mentioned, uh,

245
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,560
on Monday or last Wednesday,

246
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:23,610
this is that Mark's was half right in
thinking that people judge their utility

247
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,430
by what others get.
They don't just ask the Reagan question,

248
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:31,560
am I better off than I was four years ago?

249
00:17:31,561 --> 00:17:35,730
They do pay attention to what others get,
but they generally,

250
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:37,710
and this is the part where he was wrong.

251
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:43,030
I know a hundred years of industrial
sociology has now pretty much established

252
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:48,360
desk. They tend to compare themselves
to similarly situated people.

253
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:53,660
So workers in the auto industry compare
themselves to steelworkers or coworkers,

254
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,980
not,
um,

255
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,810
to the executives who run the
firms in which they actually work.

256
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:05,970
And that's true up and down
the occupational scale.
I think I mentioned, uh,

257
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:11,150
a professor will be much more upset to
learn that their salary is $5,000 less

258
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,880
than the professor in the next office.

259
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:20,150
Then they will be to learn that their
salary is $500,000 less than the attorney

260
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:24,600
who lives down the street.
People compare themselves to others,

261
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:29,870
but to similarly situated others not
to people very far from them in the

262
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,460
socioeconomic order.

263
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,480
And so that kind of
militancy doesn't eventuate.

264
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,250
More importantly,

265
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:44,690
Mark's actually conflates the relative
immiseration of the proletariat with the

266
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,410
absolute immiseration of the proletariat.

267
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,070
See if we went back
through the slides and we,

268
00:18:52,071 --> 00:18:56,160
we went back to the discussion
of the theory of exploitation.

269
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,560
Remember when, when we, we did
that little exercise and we,

270
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:05,590
we saw that you would all actually agree
to be more exploited on his definition

271
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,760
than less exploited.
Um,

272
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,470
when you had the choice of either
going to a 10 hours working day, um,

273
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,380
with new technology or an 11
hours working day without it. Um,

274
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,410
but that measure was a relative measure.

275
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:27,710
It was what you get as a proportion of
the total surplus as compared with what

276
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,790
the capitalist gets.

277
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:35,630
It wasn't an absolute measure and we
saw that it's perfectly possible for the

278
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:40,260
rate of exploitation as
he defines it to go up.

279
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:45,330
While the level of wages remains
constant or even increases.

280
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,490
So wages might be going up as well
as exploitation at the same time.

281
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:55,440
Well, but if that's true, you never
going to reach absolute immiseration.

282
00:19:55,441 --> 00:20:00,000
You're never going to actually reach the
point where we're workers are literally

283
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:01,410
falling into poverty.

284
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,580
And if it's the absolute immiseration
that has to trigger the militant action,

285
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:12,120
they're working class consciousness,
it's not going to happen.

286
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,840
And indeed,
here again,

287
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:21,680
Mark's greatly underestimated what
governments can do to make sure that the

288
00:20:22,951 --> 00:20:26,880
workers don't reach the point
where they have nothing to lose.

289
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,100
But their chains.

290
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:33,110
In the 1950s a Marxian in English marks
in political economists called Ralph

291
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,710
Miliband, who son now is a British
cabinet member, by the way.

292
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,663
Um,

293
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,590
David Miliband and this is the likely
next leader of the Labour party after they

294
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:51,591
lose the elections in
May to a David Cameron,

295
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,140
uh,

296
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:58,140
David Miller band's father Ralph wrote
a book called the state in Capitalist

297
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,710
Society in the 1950s,

298
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,420
I think it was 1954 but don't
hold me to it in which he said,

299
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,600
the welfare state is
capitalism's best friend.

300
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,180
Okay.

301
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,940
You know, the right always
attacks the welfare state,

302
00:21:11,941 --> 00:21:16,850
but it's capitalism's best friend because
it buys off working plus discontent.

303
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:22,250
And it ensures that workers have a stake
in the existing order and that they

304
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:27,411
will never reach this proverbial
situation where they have nothing to lose,

305
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,120
but they're chains.
So when you,

306
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:36,330
you work your way through
this macro theory,

307
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:41,390
it's riddled with holes and doesn't
add up to the collapse of capitalism.

308
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:47,420
And it not therefore
particularly surprising that
a capitalism didn't collapse

309
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,210
in the ways that Mark's predicted.

310
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,200
But now let's dig in a little bit
more to the micro theory and the micro

311
00:21:57,211 --> 00:22:01,940
foundations of Marxists thinking
because I think this is where, um,

312
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,340
we will find,
uh,

313
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,500
some interesting lessons for our own
project in this course going forward.

314
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,660
At the heart of the micro theory
is the labor theory of value.

315
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:21,150
And we're going to say something
about three aspects of it.

316
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,840
We're going to talk about,
um,

317
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,390
Mark's assumptions about
living human labor,

318
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:33,630
the moral argument behind
the Labor theory of value,

319
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,830
which many people you
will find in this room,

320
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:43,370
find the POA despite the problems with
the labor theory of value and then some

321
00:22:43,831 --> 00:22:48,720
alternative formulations of what
it is that he was trying to do.

322
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:59,110
If, if you think back to when
we were doing the exposition
of the Labor theory of

323
00:22:59,111 --> 00:22:59,944
value,

324
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,880
I said that Mark's defends it living
human labor power as a source of value by

325
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:09,970
saying it's the only thing

326
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,363
that

327
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:17,610
goes into the production. It's the only
thing that creates fresh surplus value.

328
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,180
Okay.
So one difficulty is,

329
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,070
and John Roma points this out in
that piece that I had you read,

330
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:31,020
it ignores the contribution of
dead workers that living workers,

331
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,730
uh, for instance, we, when we talked
about the introduction of machinery,

332
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,260
the Spinning Jenny or whatever, what
about the workers who made the spinning?

333
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:43,950
Jenny,
are they part of this calculation?

334
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,960
Are they being either by the capitalist
or by the living workers who use the

335
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,180
Spinning Jenny?
So if you took it seriously,

336
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:59,020
you'd have to say those exploitation
indexes is way too simple because they

337
00:23:59,301 --> 00:24:03,260
don't capture the
contribution of dead workers.

338
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,720
But then a second thing,

339
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:10,750
it doesn't capture the Labor theory of
value as soon as the capitalists can

340
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,653
contributes

341
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:13,940
what?
Nothing.

342
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,060
But why isn't it the case
that what the, the, the,

343
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,560
the Labor that the capitalists performs
also goes in to the creation of the

344
00:24:28,751 --> 00:24:32,740
surplus. And again, I think
you've got to imagine,

345
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,980
get yourself back into
this 19th century mindset.

346
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,690
Her intellectual work doesn't
seem petty particularly important.

347
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:45,760
Um, you know, you're just running
these big factories. But of course,

348
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:49,150
you know, when we think
about what the, the, the,

349
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:55,350
the role of entrepreneurial ideas is
in the creation of productive systems.

350
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,500
It's absurd to say that the work of the
capitalist doesn't contribute anything

351
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:06,850
to the value of what's produced.
But then you get into the problem of,

352
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,560
well,
how do you discover what is,

353
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:13,590
what is the result of the work of the
worker and what is the result of the work

354
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:15,310
of the cap and list?

355
00:25:15,311 --> 00:25:19,510
And there's no mechanism
for dealing with that.

356
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,363
And then

357
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:28,740
what about the fact that
the worker in March,

358
00:25:28,741 --> 00:25:33,741
this typical model has a spouse at home

359
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:40,440
feeding him, uh, you know, uh,

360
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,401
sending him,

361
00:25:41,401 --> 00:25:44,880
making his sandwiches as he goes to
the factory and so on and so forth.

362
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,100
What about the spouse at home?

363
00:25:47,101 --> 00:25:50,520
Why is it just the worker
who's being exploited?

364
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:53,480
And

365
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,130
various theorists have said,
you know,

366
00:25:55,131 --> 00:25:59,780
if you take Marxism seriously on its
own premises, it seems that, again,

367
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:01,550
just as with the dead worker,

368
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:06,580
the stay at home spouse is either being
exploited indirectly by the capitalist

369
00:26:06,951 --> 00:26:10,040
or is being exploited by
the worker who goes to work.

370
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,040
She is doing unpaid labor.

371
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:18,041
And so we've had a series of feminist
critiques of the Labor theory of value

372
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:23,563
and

373
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,440
this gets recognized in daily life.
Uh, this, uh, very interesting,

374
00:26:29,441 --> 00:26:34,441
1986 divorce case in the
state of New York in which,

375
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,430
uh,
a couple had gotten married.

376
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,620
He had gone to medical school,

377
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:46,770
she had stayed at and darn does socks and
made sandwiches for him and helped him

378
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:50,940
through medical school. Anyway,
many years later they get divorced.

379
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,280
And apart from the usual
issues in the divorce of, um,

380
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:01,050
the courts said that the stay at home wife

381
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:06,880
had a property interest in her
husband's medical practice.

382
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:13,400
That was a byproduct of the work that
she had put into it by darning socks and

383
00:27:13,401 --> 00:27:17,120
making the sandwiches. And he went
to class and built up his practice.

384
00:27:17,121 --> 00:27:22,121
And so they awarded her 40% property
interest in the practice and required him

385
00:27:22,281 --> 00:27:27,281
to maintain life insurance in her name
for the rest of his life so that her

386
00:27:28,371 --> 00:27:31,010
property interest could be protected.

387
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:35,000
So what you can see once you
start to do this, you know,

388
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:38,720
I've just given three areas
where this runs into trouble.

389
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,900
Once you take seriously the idea that
Labor is the source or labor power,

390
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,170
the capacity to work
is the source of value.

391
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:51,620
Why zero in men in this,
you know,

392
00:27:51,621 --> 00:27:56,621
motto and I Echo y on what one worker
dies and the who in the production

393
00:27:57,501 --> 00:27:58,310
process.

394
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:03,310
What about all of the others
who contribute to PR to
the productivity of the

395
00:28:03,651 --> 00:28:07,670
process? Either directly as with
the capitalists will indirectly.

396
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:12,950
And of course, once you make this point
about the stay at home spouse, you know,

397
00:28:12,951 --> 00:28:17,660
what about the Sunday school teacher
that drum the work ethic into the worker.

398
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,813
Um,

399
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:23,030
didn't that Sunday school
teacher contribute something
to the productivity of

400
00:28:23,031 --> 00:28:26,210
the worker and so on. So
you're going to get, you know,

401
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,000
this huge web of indecipherable entangled,
um,

402
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,950
entitlements.
Um,

403
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:38,980
if you're trying to trace out who
contributed what work to the creation of

404
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:41,180
something of value,

405
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:43,720
okay,

406
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,070
more fundamentally,

407
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:53,090
let's dig into the assumption that

408
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,930
making creates entitlements
after all. For Marx, it's the,

409
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:02,840
it's this is what seems
to give the theory.

410
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:07,400
It's it's ideological edge. Uh, as I said,

411
00:29:07,401 --> 00:29:09,920
it's a secular version of locks.
Workmanship.

412
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:13,520
It's the claim that work has produced
something for which they're are not

413
00:29:13,521 --> 00:29:18,140
compensated. They produce
something and the capitalist
takes it, right. That's the,

414
00:29:18,141 --> 00:29:19,130
that's the claim.

415
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,473
Okay.

416
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,480
And when we were doing
the exposition of that,

417
00:29:23,481 --> 00:29:28,481
I said that what differentiates labor
power from all other commodities is that

418
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:34,610
it's necessary for the
production of every commodity.

419
00:29:34,611 --> 00:29:38,630
It's the common denominator
of all commodities. Man,

420
00:29:38,631 --> 00:29:43,590
by gave you the example, I said if I, um,

421
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:49,900
if I have a certain amount of
money and I spend it on a meal,

422
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,230
I consume the meal and it's gone.

423
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:59,710
Whereas if I spend it paying somebody
to paint my house at the end of having

424
00:30:00,111 --> 00:30:02,990
consumed their labor power,
I have a more valuable house.

425
00:30:02,991 --> 00:30:04,520
If I go to sell the house,

426
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:08,780
I'm going to get more from
it than I would have gotten.

427
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,970
But for having, uh, not ha
not having had it painted.

428
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,740
And so that's the idea that
the consumption of living
human labor power leads

429
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:21,740
the fresh ration of fresh exchange value.

430
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,320
Whereas media consumption
of a meal doesn't.

431
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:26,420
Yeah,

432
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:30,280
terrible argument.
What's wrong with it?

433
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:46,300
Nobody can see what's wrong with
it. Come on. It's terrible argument.

434
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,060
Hopelessly bad argument.

435
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,090
Anybody.
Yes ma'am.

436
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,910
Um, could the meals value be that it
keeps you alive? Say, say a little more.

437
00:31:02,911 --> 00:31:07,740
You're dead right. Um, so the meal, even
though it's, you can only use it once,

438
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:12,240
um, it is necessary for this
sustained value of like yourself.

439
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,420
Okay. And, and what, but just take,
take that thought a little further.

440
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:18,340
Where does it go? Yeah, you're dead right.

441
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,323
Um,

442
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:25,120
so the valued is like constant,

443
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,900
well, not exactly, but the
point, is it just wrong?

444
00:31:28,901 --> 00:31:33,560
Just say it and I can consume that food.
It goes because after all,

445
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:37,600
I have more calories of energy, which I
could then use to pay my own house with.

446
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:38,680
Right?
Let's say,

447
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:42,370
of course I might sit on the couch and
watch the Superbowl and just get fat,

448
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:47,080
but that's my own decision,
right? I can use that energy,

449
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:52,150
right. To paint the house and
saw a very interesting, um,

450
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:58,410
Cambridge economist called Pierre Ross
Rafa wrote a book called the production

451
00:31:58,811 --> 00:32:03,340
of commodities by means of
commodities in the, uh, it's,

452
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:06,490
it's even though it's a s
it's about an 80 page book.

453
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:10,490
It took him 30 pages to 30 years to write.
Um,

454
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,600
and that's a whole different story,
which I have time to go into. But he,

455
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:18,790
this is what he, this is what he said,
that's of interest to us. He said,

456
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:23,350
imagine an economy that has
three commodities, corn, books,

457
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,393
food.

458
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,760
I'm sorry, corn books. Labor. Corn
is food, corn books and Viber.

459
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,990
Yes. It's true that it takes labor
to produce corn and to produce box.

460
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,580
Yes, it's true that it does not
take books to produce corn or labor,

461
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,350
but it's not true

462
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,930
that it doesn't require corn
to produce labor and books,

463
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:00,540
so corn or food or anything
that's necessary for the
production of labor power

464
00:33:01,181 --> 00:33:04,930
is going to have the same
property that labor power has.

465
00:33:04,931 --> 00:33:09,931
Its going to be present ness necessarily
directly or indirectly in all lines of

466
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:15,640
production and strokes.
Rafa said based on that idea you can,

467
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:20,750
you couldn't do a corn theory of value
for this economy that will have exactly

468
00:33:21,851 --> 00:33:23,740
the same mathematical properties.

469
00:33:23,741 --> 00:33:27,420
It's the labor theory of value
and then you can do the tea.

470
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:31,090
You can have your theory of the
exploitation of corn by capitol,

471
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:34,000
the rate of exploitation
of corn by capital.

472
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:39,150
That will be exactly analogous to the
rate of the exploitation of Labor by

473
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:43,960
Capitol. There is no difference,
mathematically identical.

474
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,860
Why is that interesting to us?

475
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:56,930
It's interesting to us because it
shows you that whatever mark says about

476
00:33:57,151 --> 00:34:00,870
exploitation merely being a
technical notion, it's not,

477
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,370
it's a moral idea. We don't
care. You know, we do.

478
00:34:05,371 --> 00:34:09,690
We even colloquially, we talk about
the exploitation of natural resources,

479
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,550
but we don't care.

480
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:16,580
We don't say that the corn owns
what was produced with the corn.

481
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:19,440
We don't sell,

482
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,610
we don't say the corn was exploited
in the way that worker was exploited.

483
00:34:23,611 --> 00:34:24,450
We just don't

484
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,060
think about an intermediate case.

485
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,120
Okay.

486
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,770
A horse down a mine shaft
in a coal mine hauling

487
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:42,130
trucks have called from the face to the,
to the,

488
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:47,290
um, elevator that's going
to take it out. You know,

489
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:51,010
we could do the whole, he, the
story, we could say the, the,

490
00:34:51,011 --> 00:34:56,011
the horse covers the cost of its
feed in the first hour of the day.

491
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:01,060
Uh,
and it works 10 hour days.

492
00:35:01,061 --> 00:35:06,061
So the other nine hours it's producing
surplus that accrues to somebody other

493
00:35:06,731 --> 00:35:10,000
than the horse.
It's the horse exploited.

494
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,570
Yes.
No,

495
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,480
nobody thinks that. Nobody thinks
of the horse. Is it an exploited,

496
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,213
some

497
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,780
much trickier case.
Right.

498
00:35:23,781 --> 00:35:28,781
And the reason it's tricky is some
people are much more open to the idea of

499
00:35:29,601 --> 00:35:33,950
animal rights than others, right? So,

500
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,510
you know, for block, Trina
said animals where there,

501
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:40,950
what waste of God put there for I use,
but we're not that hard hearted.

502
00:35:40,951 --> 00:35:41,784
Some of us.

503
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:47,060
So if you think of of the horses in
some sense a kind of moral agent,

504
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,590
then it's,
it's not a happy thing that it's being,

505
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,630
it's being exploited in the sense,

506
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:59,520
but whether or not we want to say
the exploitation is on just not just,

507
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,740
just cruel if the horse is suffering.

508
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,800
But I'd just depends upon some prior idea

509
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:10,820
that people are,

510
00:36:10,821 --> 00:36:14,900
or creatures are entitled to

511
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,180
the product of their labor.

512
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,500
Okay.

513
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,120
That's the workmanship idea.

514
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:26,690
And that is why even if you
reject the labor theory of value,

515
00:36:26,941 --> 00:36:30,840
you're still left with this,
this nagging idea

516
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,260
that there's something to workmanship.

517
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:40,030
Most people are not gonna want to
totally get rid of workmanship.

518
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:44,950
You know, if I write a book,
I think I put all that blood,

519
00:36:44,951 --> 00:36:49,360
sweat and tears into that
book. It's mine. It's mine.

520
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,440
My work. Somebody takes that.
You've stolen something that I made.

521
00:36:53,441 --> 00:36:56,770
It's a very powerful thing in people,

522
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,770
but not everybody accepts it,
right?

523
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,830
Not Everybody accepts this idea,

524
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:14,350
this very individualistic sense
centric conception that we own.

525
00:37:15,581 --> 00:37:19,330
What we make. We have this
kind of exclusive, uh,

526
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,830
to go back to the language of lock in
the first treaties that week. We are,

527
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:27,190
God made us with the capacity
to be miniature gods,

528
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:32,191
to have the same ownership rights of a
what we make as he has over his creation.

529
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:41,050
Look at chief Seattle.
He has a very different view.

530
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,720
This,
we know the earth does not belong to man.

531
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,300
Man belongs to the earth.

532
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:57,710
All things are connected like
the blood that unites us all.

533
00:37:57,711 --> 00:38:01,670
Man did not weave the web of life.
He is married a strand in it.

534
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:05,690
Whatever he does to the web,
he does to himself.

535
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:10,190
Very different view of the world
and our place in it, right?

536
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:14,420
Not Man centric. And when we, when we,

537
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,980
one of the reasons we started
this course with lock,

538
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,980
it's this is where the individualism
comes from. It's this workmanship ideal.

539
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,090
Doesn't lucky individualist at all in
locks formulation because at the end of

540
00:38:26,091 --> 00:38:30,060
the day, it's a theological argument.
It's an argument about lock, uh,

541
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:34,610
about God having owner make has
rights over his whole creation.

542
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:38,770
But it's the move of saying
we are miniature gods

543
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:45,320
that can behave in a godly
fashion and then secularizing it,

544
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:46,640
which,

545
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,640
which leads to the individualism or
consider something that Robert Nozick,

546
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,520
uh,

547
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:59,520
a writer we're going to read later in
the class pretty soon actually starting

548
00:38:59,901 --> 00:39:03,950
next week.
He makes fun of the Labor theory of value.

549
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:09,440
He says, why does mixing once Labor
with something make one the owner of it.

550
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,060
Okay.

551
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,870
Behalfs paps because one owns one's labor,

552
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,180
self ownership if you lie.

553
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:21,840
And so one comes to own a previously
unknown thing that becomes permeated with

554
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:26,110
what one on ownership
seeps over into the rest.

555
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,840
But why isn't it,
why isn't mixing what I own with what?

556
00:39:31,841 --> 00:39:36,841
I don't own a way of losing what I own
rather than of gaining what I don't know

557
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:43,080
if I own a can of tomato juice and spell
it into the sea so that its molecules

558
00:39:44,111 --> 00:39:49,060
made re radioactive. So I can check
this mingle evenly throughout the sea.

559
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:54,510
Do I thereby come to own the sea or have
I foolishly dissipated my tomato juice?

560
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,730
Okay.

561
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,390
Why is it that we want to say,
when I made,

562
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:07,620
I put effort and energy into
something that it's mine.

563
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:14,870
Very, very perplexing and tricky
thing. And we will come back to it,

564
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,100
uh,
in,

565
00:40:16,101 --> 00:40:21,101
in considerably more detail later in the
course when we read John Rawls because

566
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,540
interestingly,

567
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:29,170
it's not until we get to John Rawls that
we find anyone who's really willing to

568
00:40:29,481 --> 00:40:34,481
radically question workmanship and the
self ownership postulate that goes with

569
00:40:36,741 --> 00:40:41,430
it.
Okay.

570
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,690
So mark says,
I'm seems problematic.

571
00:40:45,691 --> 00:40:50,160
So what's left, and I think there
are really two main things left.

572
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:55,290
One is a negative argument that comes
out of Marxism rather than any of its

573
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:57,990
positive, uh, claims.

574
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:03,860
And that is the fact that his theory of
exploitation fails doesn't mean that he

575
00:41:06,271 --> 00:41:09,900
lacks a good critique of
markets as distributors, uh,

576
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,770
either goods or harms in society.

577
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,430
You know, we could go back to our
story about Trump and the bag lady,

578
00:41:22,431 --> 00:41:24,380
for example.
Um,

579
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:29,780
the Paredo superior result in that
example of you remember wished for the bag

580
00:41:30,231 --> 00:41:35,231
lady to die because there was no righto
x superior exchange that could occur

581
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:40,430
between Trump and the bag laggy markets.

582
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:42,993
Okay,

583
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:46,110
reflect the inequalities
that come in to them,

584
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,140
but they don't give any account of
the justice of those inequalities.

585
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:55,280
So as there's this problem, if you
like, of the tyranny of the status quo.

586
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,630
And we saw that in the economic realm
with the analysis of that problem and in

587
00:41:59,631 --> 00:42:04,280
the political realm when we talked about
the the corn dealer problem with Mel,

588
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:08,870
right? That the market systems
of bias towards the status quo,

589
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:12,890
but market principles are
purely procedural principles.

590
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,190
They tell you nothing about
how you got the status quo.

591
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,400
And so there's a kind of garbage in
garbage out problem with market systems.

592
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:26,770
Nozick we will say makes
this point explicit when he
says any remotely plausible

593
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:32,870
theory of justice is going
to have to have three parts.

594
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:37,850
A theory of justice in acquisition,
a. I. E. A theory of starting points,

595
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:43,240
a theory of justice in transfer I a
theory of exchanges and the theory of the

596
00:42:43,671 --> 00:42:48,230
rectification of past injustice.
I E F theory for dressing,

597
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,520
um,

598
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,470
accumulated injustices of the par paused
and Nozick well for reasons which we

599
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:57,830
will go into. Thanks. He has
accounts of all of those things,

600
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:01,260
but it's an the negative crap.
Um,

601
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:06,370
the negative argument of Marxism that
markets are not justified by reference to

602
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:13,610
the failure of marks or so an
alternative theory is good.

603
00:43:13,611 --> 00:43:18,611
If you're going to have a justification
for the distribution that occurs through

604
00:43:18,711 --> 00:43:22,070
markets,
it's gonna have to be something else.

605
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:25,910
It's gonna have to be provided.
Maybe it can be provided.

606
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:30,800
But so far in the utilitarian
and neo classical traditions,

607
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:32,300
it hasn't been provided.

608
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:37,690
So there's a kind of unfinished agenda
there that's put on the table by the,

609
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,300
the Marxian Critique of markets.
Um,

610
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:44,910
even though his answer to that,
his marks,

611
00:43:44,911 --> 00:43:48,710
his answer to that problem
is, uh, I'm convincing.

612
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,860
And then I think secondly,

613
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:57,021
what Marx is,

614
00:43:57,021 --> 00:44:02,021
I'm leaves us to address is not an
argument about the sources of value.

615
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:08,791
The labor theory of value is just
a hopeless analytical mass and uh,

616
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,550
can't be resuscitated. There's no
way to fix the labor theory of value.

617
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,840
Um,
but there is an argument about freedom.

618
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,820
Remember where we started?
I said,

619
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:26,860
unlike the conventional wisdom
that Marx is an egalitarian, no,

620
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:30,850
he's a theorist of freedom.
His Utopian ideal,

621
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:35,340
a world in which the free development
of each is the condition for the free

622
00:44:35,341 --> 00:44:38,670
development of all where our
neighbor is not an alienated.

623
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,140
We saw that the Utopian version
of that is unsustainable.

624
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:44,760
Nonetheless.

625
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,170
Mark says definition of class.
When you think about it,

626
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,660
it's really an argument about freedom.

627
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:56,130
Yeah.

628
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:58,320
When do you say she,
you're working class.

629
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,580
If you have to sell your labor power
to somebody else in order to live,

630
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:03,960
it's the compulsion,

631
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:05,843
right?

632
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,410
It's a compulsion. It's not why
that you choose to, you know,

633
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:12,180
I liked lecturing here.

634
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:16,590
Having a captive audience of people
have to listen to me ramble on and dusty

635
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:20,160
makes me feel good, but that's
not what makes me working class.

636
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:21,500
Right?

637
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,580
It's that, that I have to work for
somebody else in order to survive.

638
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:29,360
It's that element of compulsion.
That's your lack of freedom.

639
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:33,620
And that is the so,
so as,

640
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:37,610
AS Roma puts it in the essay
that I put on the syllabus,

641
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,350
it's that some,

642
00:45:39,351 --> 00:45:44,351
there's a class monopoly of the means
of production which creates that power

643
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,970
that some people have the power to
insist that other people work for them.

644
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,920
So it's really not about the
calculus of contributions and who,

645
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,210
what's what and you know,

646
00:45:56,211 --> 00:46:01,100
whether the rate of exploitation
2.33 or 1.6 or anything,

647
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,630
it's not about that.

648
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:07,940
It's really about the distribution
of power in the production process.

649
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:13,150
And if we're going to take anything
from marks that is of enduring value,

650
00:46:13,581 --> 00:46:15,590
it's going to be an argument about power.

651
00:46:15,591 --> 00:46:20,591
It's going to be an argument which says
that a world in which we organize things

652
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:26,050
so that one class effectively has
power to control a different classes,

653
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:29,150
behavior that is an unjust world,

654
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:34,550
and much of the Neo Marxist
literature that, um,

655
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:35,630
okay.

656
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:40,630
People take seriously jettisons the
labor theory of value and explores this

657
00:46:41,241 --> 00:46:46,241
power based argument as the root of what
it was Mark's was trying to get at with

658
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:52,190
the concept of exploitation.
See you on Monday.
