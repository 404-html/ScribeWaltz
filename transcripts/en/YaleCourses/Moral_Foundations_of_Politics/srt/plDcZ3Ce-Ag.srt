1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,660
Okay.
Uh,

2
00:00:02,661 --> 00:00:07,220
we're going to pick up where we left
off with talking about Mark's last time.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,950
And,
um,

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,480
there towards the end of today's lecture,

5
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:19,860
there'll be some quotations that I'm
putting up on the slides to talk about.

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,270
You shouldn't try and scribble them
down. Uh, they're too long for that.

7
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:27,570
And I put the slides up on the,
on the server so you can,

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,720
you can find them there. It's
better to follow them. And,

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,820
and the argument that I'm making,

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,720
so I was just talking to some of the tea
teaching fellows about how the sections

11
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:42,600
went and it seemed like there was some

12
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,570
confusion or lack of, um, what's the word?

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,920
A lack of comfort with this
concept of exploitation in Mark's.

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,900
Just where does it come from and how
does exploitation occur when people are

15
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:01,080
buying,
making voluntary paredo exchanges.

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,190
And I think that is the
right question to zero in on.

17
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:07,390
And we're going to spend more time on it,
uh,

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,650
both today and next time because it really
is important for Marxists argument to

19
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:17,730
work that exploitation is
not about cheating people.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,410
It's not about getting people
to do things in voluntarily.

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,370
The, the idea behind the concept
of exploitation is equivalent,

22
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,310
is it changed for equivalent use
values a voluntarily exchange.

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,690
So another way of putting it,
it if you like, is that, um,

24
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,940
the transaction between the employer
and the worker is a parade. Oh,

25
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:45,900
superior transaction and marks
is not claiming that it isn't.

26
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,970
So then you might say, well, what
is this idea of exploitation?

27
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,460
And we saw that in some ways it's
quite counter intuitive because,

28
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,360
um, when we, when we
worked through this, uh,

29
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,390
the only way in which the capitalist can
increase his productivity is by either

30
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,670
increases in what Marx called
absolute surplus value,

31
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:15,870
which is basically lengthening the working
day, getting people to work harder.

32
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,630
They're obviously physical limits to that.

33
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:21,250
And political limits workers
are going to organize,

34
00:02:21,251 --> 00:02:24,930
they're going to get the 10 hours bell
passed through parliament as they indeed

35
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:29,400
dead. Um, and so then you get, um,

36
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,650
the, the other approach, what he called
increases in relative surplus value,

37
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:39,651
which is technological innovation so
that the capitalists can cover his wage

38
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:44,250
bill in less time.
And so this,

39
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,600
the,
the

40
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,613
okay

41
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,730
necessary labor time goes from
four hours to three and there's um,

42
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:57,270
seven hours of surplus labor time where
the workers producing goods that when

43
00:02:57,371 --> 00:03:01,300
sold produce value that
does not accrue to them.

44
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,960
Okay.
We thought there was,

45
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,840
there was some in coward counterintuitive
here and we're going to come back to

46
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:12,841
that in that most of you figured you
would choose three over Cho if the

47
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:16,570
alternative,
if you had to take one of them,

48
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,280
but that's actually a higher
rate of exploitation. Uh,

49
00:03:20,281 --> 00:03:24,820
and I started talking about
the assumptions about how
people compare themselves.

50
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:29,200
Remember the self referential versus
other referential and we'll come back to

51
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:30,640
all of that.
Um,

52
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:36,030
but the point I want to make first and
to get you just clearly to understand is

53
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:40,140
that this,
these,

54
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,240
this kind of move increasing productivity
by technological innovation is marks

55
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:53,401
and modern economists all agree is the
thing that makes capitalism dynamically

56
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:57,880
productive because it's,
it's the,

57
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,030
it's the pressure to innovate that

58
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,370
is created by a capitalist competition
that leads to technological innovation

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,680
and more and more, um, more and more

60
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,760
capital intensive production.

61
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,940
Because if you think about it,

62
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:27,390
the more you're spending
on PR on technology to make
your labor more productive,

63
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,790
the less you're spending on your wage
bill and it's only living human labor

64
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:37,420
power that creates fresh
value according to Marx,

65
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,740
and so what we were, when we think
about this line moving this way,

66
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,090
we thinking about production
becoming evermore capital intensive,

67
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:51,400
right? More and more spent on
technology to make the pro,

68
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,440
the the workers more productive and
we should expect capital in a capital

69
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,530
intensity to increase over time.

70
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,690
When you see Mark's talk about used
phrases like the organic composition of

71
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:06,070
capital increases,

72
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:11,310
he's just saying that that productions
becomes steadily more capital intensive.

73
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,170
Now you could say,
well,

74
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:19,171
why is this exploitation and
Mark's once to say this is,

75
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,490
I think at the end of the day,

76
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:25,420
not a very plausible argument for
reasons we'll see on Wednesday.

77
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,660
He wants to say,
this is not a moral argument.

78
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,780
This is not a normative argument.
He's jumped.

79
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,940
He's using it as a technical term.

80
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:39,390
And so the fact that people don't feel
more exploited in this circumstance then

81
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,730
in this is neither here nor there.
It's,

82
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,960
it's true in the class in itself
since that I talked about last time,

83
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:50,410
that they objectively speaking,
are more exploited.

84
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,510
He has an argument about why they will
eventually come to feel more exploited.

85
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:58,160
That will attend to a
little bit later today.

86
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,210
But for right now,
um,

87
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,000
he's just wants to say this
is an object of argument.

88
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,930
Now you could say, well, so is the rate
of exploitation the rate of profit?

89
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,260
And the answer is no,
it's not the right of profit because this,

90
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:21,220
the value that's created here,
the song called variable capitol,

91
00:06:21,221 --> 00:06:23,020
which just covers the wage bell,

92
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:28,480
is separated out from capitol
that's spent on everything else.

93
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,100
So it's true that the capitalists
profit comes out of here, but,

94
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,930
but so rant, uh,

95
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:41,110
research and development costs,
advertising, mail, you name it.

96
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:46,510
So profit is some subset of this,
but not the totality of it.

97
00:06:46,511 --> 00:06:51,511
So the rate of profit is not the same
thing as the rate of surplus value.

98
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,650
And the right of profit is also not
the same as the rate of exploitation.

99
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:02,220
But what did he is assuming in the concept
of exploitation is that the worker is

100
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:07,921
producing some value that ultimately
accrues to the capitalist.

101
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Now I said to you when we started out
talking about marks that he just liked the

102
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:15,730
neo classical theorists.

103
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,150
He has a micro theory and a macro theory.

104
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:23,110
You now know what the micro theory is.
It's this story here.

105
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:28,060
You might think about it.
This diagram is to marks what the parade,

106
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:30,370
oh diagram is to the parade.
Oh system.

107
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,640
This is the micro story of exploitation
in the same way that the predo system is

108
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:40,270
the micro theory of market exchanges,

109
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,640
but at the end of the day, of course
it's this a macro theory as well.

110
00:07:45,641 --> 00:07:46,421
As I said,

111
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:51,421
marks like Adam Smith and David Ricardo
before him had an invisible hand theory

112
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:53,831
and the,

113
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:58,831
I think the easiest way to get a grip
on his macro theory is to talk about the

114
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:04,711
five sources of crisis in capitalist
systems that he thought followed from his

115
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,630
analytical logic.

116
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,950
And I'm just gonna spell them all out now.
Um,

117
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:16,570
none of them is without its problems
and we'll come back to the problems, uh,

118
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,970
later today and mostly on Wednesday.

119
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,180
But I think it's better first to see
the argument in its totality before we

120
00:08:24,281 --> 00:08:28,480
start, uh, dismembering
it and see what, what, uh,

121
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,740
survives and what doesn't survive
plus or critical scrutiny.

122
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,740
So in the first instance,

123
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,550
one of the possible sources of
crisis is the existence of money.

124
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,250
Now, money from Marx is a
commodity. Like anything else.

125
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,510
This is of course before the era of
paper money and anything like that.

126
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,760
So money is gold or silver or
something like that. And it's,

127
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:03,300
it's a commodity like any
other commodity. Um, it's,

128
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:06,240
value is determined by
the cost of producing it.

129
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:10,620
So gold is valuable because it takes
a lot of work to dig it up basically.

130
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,210
Right? And to refine it. Um,

131
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,400
obviously for a commodity
to function as money,

132
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,150
it's got to have certain properties.
It's got to be easily divisible.

133
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:25,500
And you know, we use cheap [inaudible]
kind of hard because you know,

134
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:29,560
if you want to use, you know,
the one, one leg of a sheep, uh,

135
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,870
to represent a three bottles of wine,
they have to kill the sheep,

136
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:35,250
wouldn't be very convenient.

137
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,810
So money has to be easily
divisible and not, um,

138
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,020
not atrophy and things like that.
But apart from the,

139
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:47,730
those are its properties as a
use fattier if unite, but as,

140
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,090
as an exchangeable commodity.
It's like anything else.

141
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,230
But once you get to develop market system,

142
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,590
it depends on money to function.
And this,

143
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,250
the ever present possibility
of liquidity crises.

144
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:07,280
If people start hoarding money and he
thinks that in times of anxiety and so on,

145
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,500
people will start to hoard
money. We saw this, uh, uh,

146
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,700
if you remember during the
financial crisis last year,

147
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:22,910
whereas suddenly Manx that had trusted
one another for decades and even

148
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:23,994
centuries,

149
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:29,150
stop trusting one another and wouldn't
lend money at one money to one another in

150
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:34,170
ways that they regularly did because
they didn't know whether the other party

151
00:10:34,171 --> 00:10:35,490
had the money to lend.

152
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:40,491
And there was a period of several weeks
where the entire financial system was in

153
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:45,591
danger of crashing simply
from the liquidity crisis
that sort of was perched on

154
00:10:45,931 --> 00:10:48,030
top of the credit crisis.

155
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:52,860
So once the system becomes
completely dependent on money, uh,

156
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,600
as a medium of exchange,

157
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:59,601
there's the ever present possibility
that people will hoard money and um,

158
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,300
the system will go into a crisis.

159
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,210
Secondly,

160
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:14,330
Mark's thinks he's now understood better
than Smith and Ricardo before him.

161
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,540
Just why it is that there's a declining
tendency in the rate of profit in

162
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:26,370
capitalist systems and the,
and the answer is in the,

163
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,220
in the logic of the system you've already
worked your way through. So if we,

164
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,520
if you go back to here as we move down
here to make the system more capital

165
00:11:40,261 --> 00:11:41,094
intensive,

166
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:46,910
any given move increases profitability
for the person who makes it.

167
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,610
So if this is the status quo and it's a
cotton factory and the capitalists puts

168
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:58,870
in his spinning Jenny and makes,
um,

169
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,820
makes his wage belt more
quickly than anybody else,

170
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,800
that leads him to be able to
undercut his competitor. Right?

171
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,470
And so his profits will go up,

172
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:16,650
but all the competitors
all then themselves make
exactly the same innovation

173
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,600
themselves.

174
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,040
And then once once you have spinning
jennies throughout the cotton industry,

175
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:32,170
the claim is that the rate of profit in
the cotton industry will be lower than

176
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:36,010
before anybody had put in
a spinning Jenny. Okay.

177
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,250
So that the idea is what you do at the
margin to improve your profits as a

178
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:46,501
capitalist leads to the declining rate
of profit in the industry as a whole.

179
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,250
Because um,

180
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,590
as we become more and more capital
intensive in the production of cotton,

181
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,521
we have less,

182
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:59,410
less living human labor power going into
the production of cotton and it's only

183
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:03,190
living human labor power
that produces fresh value.

184
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,930
Now you might type,
it doesn't,

185
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:09,931
the Spinning Jenny produce fresh
value Marxist argument is no,

186
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,950
the value of the spinning Jenny was
determined by the Labor to produce the

187
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:19,510
spinning Jenny and its value
is transferred to the product.

188
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,450
But that's all.
It doesn't produce new value.

189
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:24,610
It's only the living human labor power.

190
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:30,030
And the way you need to think about it
is that that is less and less and less of

191
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:34,870
the capitalists investment as a
proportion of his total investment.

192
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:40,260
So living human labor power or variable
capitol as Marx calls it is diminishing

193
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:46,651
proportion of what the capitalist has to
invest in order to remain competitive.

194
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:52,260
And so overtime profits are going to
diminish in very competitive industries

195
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,290
because they'll get more
and more productive.

196
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:00,340
And that's what we mean in the modern
world when we say there's a very,

197
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,850
very little margin in
a particular industry,

198
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,710
you want to go into making
something like salad dressing,

199
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,090
very saturated market where
every Gizmo has been tried,

200
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,980
you're going to find miniscule
margins. Uh, very, very hard.

201
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:22,510
And Mark's thinks this is a
process going on economy wide.

202
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,020
And so that's why economy wide,

203
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,060
the rate of profit gradually declines
in capitalist systems. And as I said,

204
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:34,900
that's something that all of the
classical economists thought that they had

205
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:35,734
observed.

206
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:40,950
And so any theory worth it's name
was going to have to account for it.

207
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,740
So that,
that's the second source of crisis though.

208
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,360
Because as it becomes harder and harder
for capitalists to make a profit,

209
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,800
many of them are going
to go out of business.

210
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,680
And that brings me to the third

211
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,840
source of crises in capitalist systems.

212
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:08,180
And it's basically that
competition eliminates competitors.

213
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:15,580
So that the initial market market
model he starts with is a perfectly

214
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,090
competitive one.
But what he's saying is,

215
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:25,130
of course over time,
as people go out of business,

216
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:30,170
at the same time as things are becoming
more and more and more capital intensive,

217
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,370
the and other way of putting it,
it's the entry costs become very high.

218
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,290
For instance, in 1984, when
the challenger blew up,

219
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,000
um,

220
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,800
there was a company called Morton Thiokol
making that made the o rings for the

221
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:48,650
Challenger,
right on the rocket boosters.

222
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,060
It turned out that the design was faulty.
Now you might say,

223
00:15:53,061 --> 00:15:58,061
well that was probably the end of Morton
Thiokol calls relationship with NASA

224
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,840
having, you know, made
such a terrible error.

225
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:04,490
They would go to a competitor.

226
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:09,910
But guess why Morton Thiokol is still
making rocket boosters for NASA.

227
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,490
Because you know, the notion that,
um, I would say to myself, hmm,

228
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,540
looks like a good business for me to
get into there. Obviously no good at it.

229
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,670
I'll go start making rocket
boosters for NASA is laughable,

230
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,960
right? Because the entry costs
are so high. So that's an example,

231
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,990
pretty much of an op
monopolistic industry.

232
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,250
So competition leads to innovation.
Yes,

233
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:42,430
but it also leads to the elimination of
competitors as production becomes more

234
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:46,940
and more capital intensive.
And once you don't have competitors,

235
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,250
you don't have a reason to innovate.

236
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:54,550
And the basic dynamic of capitalism
starts to slow down because monopoly

237
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:01,570
capitalism doesn't have the same
end belt incentives for innovation.

238
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:02,961
Remember,

239
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:07,370
the capitalist is not afraid of the worker
on Mark's a story that capitalist is

240
00:17:07,371 --> 00:17:10,160
afraid of the capitol
capitalist down the street.

241
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:15,610
And once there is no capitalists down the
street about to take his business away

242
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:18,520
or her business away,
then um,

243
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:22,790
this competitive dynamic
starts to atrophy.

244
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:28,010
So that's a third source of
crisis as far as he is concerned.

245
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,870
A fourth source of crisis

246
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,340
that Mark's identifies.

247
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:40,610
And here he's pretty much
actually following Adam Smith.

248
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:46,420
The way you can think about it most
straight forwardly is the worker's

249
00:17:46,611 --> 00:17:49,800
collectively,
if they pulled all of their wages,

250
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,860
couldn't buy what they produce.

251
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,070
Okay.

252
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,370
The work has collectively
can buy what they produce.

253
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,980
And that being the case,

254
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,280
this is going to be an endemic problem
of weak demand in capitalist economies.

255
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,940
There's not going to be
enough the man to satisfy.

256
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,280
There's not going to be enough demand
to satisfy the needs of the system in

257
00:18:19,761 --> 00:18:20,020
order,

258
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:25,020
in order for everything that's
produced to get Saul big problem.

259
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:27,671
You could say,
well,

260
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:32,671
doesn't that just mean wages will rise
and then date it does put some upward

261
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:37,540
pressure on wages. But
as we said, you know,

262
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,610
wages are basically
going to be held around,

263
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:43,480
consists a subsistence by unemployment.

264
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,310
And so there's not much scope
for that, right? Because if,

265
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:53,210
if wages start to rise, um, you're,

266
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,420
you're then gonna have the problem that,
uh,

267
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:03,060
any capitalist who's not in the system
will or would be capitalists to want to

268
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:03,751
be capitalist.

269
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:07,500
It's going to come in a Ron unemployed
workers to work for him or her.

270
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,020
And so drive wages down.
So this is a problem. It's,

271
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,590
it's one of the, it's why Adam Smith's
sought you got imperialism, uh,

272
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,980
and indeed Marx and Lenin
after him all thought,

273
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:24,981
one of the reasons you get imperialism
is to find markets for the goods that are

274
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:28,950
produced. There were other reasons
too, cheap resources and so on.

275
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,420
But one of the reasons is the
search for new markets, more demand.

276
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,793
Um,

277
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,180
but that's a process which has obvious
limits because eventually you kind of,

278
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,290
you know,

279
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:45,030
your empire is going to bump into the
French empire in a Belgian empire and the

280
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,550
German Empire, and you're gonna fill
up the world and then what do you do?

281
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,910
So you can stave it off with imperialism.

282
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:55,910
But the basic underlying problem is that
the work has collectively cannot buy

283
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,900
what they produce.

284
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,440
Now we see this sort of dynamic play
out in some ways during recessions when

285
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,040
there's not enough demand in the economy.
And of course,

286
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:12,480
there are things you can do about it, can
do what we did in the Great Depression.

287
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,340
The government can borrow
money and give it to, um,

288
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:23,060
basically give it to unemployed people
by hiring them to do public works and

289
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:27,690
then they spend it and stimulate
demand. Um, or they can try.

290
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,690
We've been trying to do in
the last year and a half,

291
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:35,930
they can try and get the banks to give
credit to people to buy things and

292
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:38,700
stimulate demand.
Um,

293
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,880
but it's a basic structural problem
marks things built into the very fact,

294
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,550
uh, of, uh,

295
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:51,590
that the built into the system by the
very fact that the work has collectively

296
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,860
cannot produce,

297
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,670
cannot purchase everything
that they produce.

298
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,223
Yeah.

299
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,250
Now you could say,
well these are all sort of tendencies,

300
00:21:04,251 --> 00:21:09,020
but there are counter tendencies as well
and these problems can be staved off

301
00:21:09,021 --> 00:21:13,880
imperialism being an example of staving
off the one I've just discussed and

302
00:21:13,881 --> 00:21:18,881
marks is not particularly clear on just
which one of these problems is supposed

303
00:21:19,731 --> 00:21:21,810
to be decisive.
Rather,

304
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,880
what he thinks is they'll all sort of
kick in and start to make the system creek

305
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,600
and creek at the joints
and not work very well.

306
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,120
And as that starts to happen,

307
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,080
workers will start to get mad because
they will start to discover that the

308
00:21:43,161 --> 00:21:47,810
system isn't giving them
any particular benefits.

309
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:53,140
The famous line towards the end of the
communist manifesto that you are red

310
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:58,430
workers will come to realize that they
have nothing to lose, but the chains,

311
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:02,120
the system that has given
them certain benefits,

312
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,400
we'll give them fewer and fewer benefits.

313
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:08,960
As competition becomes more cut throat.
Uh,

314
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:13,810
their employers are working with
narrow or narrow margins. Um, they,

315
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,000
they're unable to buy the huge, the, the,

316
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,610
the luxury goods that
they see all around them.

317
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,490
And so they'll start to become angry.

318
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:27,260
And that leads us to the
discussion we had last time where,

319
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,400
um, we, we,

320
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,440
we see that Mark's wants to say that the
declining relative share of the total

321
00:22:36,531 --> 00:22:39,950
product is eventually going
to make them militant.

322
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:45,310
And so the image is office of a
system becoming less and less dynamic.

323
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:50,210
The smaller and smaller number
of monopolies in every industry.

324
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:54,590
Capitalists who are going out of business,
falling down into the working class,

325
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,120
bringing all their resentments
with them. And finally, uh,

326
00:22:59,121 --> 00:23:02,750
the system starts to reach the
point where it just can't function.

327
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,550
And that's when he thanks.

328
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:09,840
The social socialist revolution
becomes both possible and necessary.

329
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:16,720
And so you will get some sort of
revolutionary moment and the workers,

330
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,193
um,

331
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:25,160
we'll take over the state and the small
remaining number of monopoly capitalist

332
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,770
will be put out of business.
Uh,

333
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,090
the means of production will
be nationalized and then, uh,

334
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,610
socialism will exist.

335
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,330
So that's the story that he's telling.

336
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:43,510
Now I want to zero in on a few
features of socialism and communism,

337
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,050
uh,
before we,

338
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,940
and then we'll come back and talk about
the difficulties with this argument.

339
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:55,370
Socialism for Marx is not an
equilibrium anymore than capitalism is.

340
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:00,730
Socialism is not a system that is
without its own internal contradictions

341
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:06,620
according to Marx. And the
reason is as he says, yeah,

342
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:09,710
we have to deal with
is a communist society.

343
00:24:09,711 --> 00:24:14,480
Not as it's developed on its own
foundations, but on the contrary,

344
00:24:14,481 --> 00:24:17,630
just as it emerges from
a capitalist society,

345
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,600
which is that's in every respect,
economically,

346
00:24:20,601 --> 00:24:25,601
morally and intellectually still stamped
with the birthmarks of the old society

347
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:31,220
from who's worm. It emerges
accordingly. The individual producer,

348
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:35,690
this is now, he's talking about after
a socialist revolution producers,

349
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,910
the individual producer receives back
from society after the deductions that

350
00:24:40,911 --> 00:24:43,640
have been made exactly
what he gives to it.

351
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:45,430
Okay,

352
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:50,430
so in other way you might put this as
workmanship is no longer hypocritical

353
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:56,920
under socialism, the work I
really gets back what he's put in,

354
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,340
he receives a certificate from
society that is furnished,

355
00:25:00,341 --> 00:25:02,260
such and such an amount of labor.

356
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:07,470
Often deducting is labor for the common
funds and with this certificate he draws

357
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:12,841
from the social stock of mean the of
means of consumption as much as the same

358
00:25:13,061 --> 00:25:15,130
amount of labor cost,

359
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,250
as much as the same amount
of labor costs. So you, so

360
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,360
you have what he,
what he describes,

361
00:25:26,361 --> 00:25:30,770
he has the rights that workers get
to what they've produced. He says

362
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,770
it's still in principle a bourgeois,
right.

363
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,400
Although in principle and practice
on no longer at loggerheads,

364
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,500
while the exchange of equivalence in
commodity exchange exists only on the

365
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:48,940
average and not in the individual video
case. Don't worry about that last phrase,

366
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:54,100
but what he's saying here is that
principle and in practice are no longer at

367
00:25:54,101 --> 00:25:54,821
loggerheads.

368
00:25:54,821 --> 00:25:59,530
What he means is the worker is
being recompensed for his work,

369
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,003
right?

370
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:08,180
Whereas under capitalism,

371
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,040
the worker appears to be being
Rican recompensed for his work,

372
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,750
but in fact some of what he produces
is accruing to the capitalists.

373
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,010
So that's the difference.

374
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,960
Principle and practice are at loggerheads
on to capitalism. It professors,

375
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:26,360
the idea that we're
entitled to what we make.

376
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:31,160
Whereas under socialism we
in fact do get what we made

377
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:33,923
and,

378
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,820
and then that sense socialism is
advanced an advanced on capitalism,

379
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:42,210
but he says in spite of this advance,

380
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:47,670
the equal rights is still constantly
stigmatized as a Bush Walker limitation.

381
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:53,150
The right of the producers is proportional
to the labor they supply and the

382
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:54,100
equality.

383
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:58,950
It consists in the fact that that
that measurement is made with an equal

384
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:02,810
standard labor. Now what
does all that mean? Ah,

385
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,340
it's rather contorted language,

386
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:10,290
but just look at a little more of the
contorted language and then I'll explain

387
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:14,260
in words of one syllable what
it means. This is from, uh,

388
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,290
the critique of the Goethe,
the program.

389
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:20,760
And what he wants to say is even
if you reward people equally,

390
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,290
even if you reward people
equally for their work,

391
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,270
there's going to be inequality
in the society. So he says, look,

392
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,070
one man is superior to another,

393
00:27:32,071 --> 00:27:36,450
physically or mentally and supplies
more labor at the same time,

394
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:41,510
works harder or can labor for a longer
time and labor to serve as a measure must

395
00:27:42,481 --> 00:27:45,840
be defined by it's duration or intensity.
Otherwise,

396
00:27:45,841 --> 00:27:48,120
it ceases to be a standard of measurement.

397
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,860
This equal rights is an unequal,
right for unequal labor.

398
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:56,880
So if some of us are stronger than others
and we get paid according to how much

399
00:27:56,881 --> 00:28:00,000
work we do, some of us are
going to get more than others.

400
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,910
Right and equal right to an equal labor.

401
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,360
It recognizes no class differences
because everyone is now only a worker like

402
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:10,920
everyone else.
Once we get to socialism,

403
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:16,560
but it tacitly rescue recognizes I
need equal individual endowments.

404
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:21,950
It passively recognizes
unequal individually endowments
and that's productive

405
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:25,050
capacity as a natural privilege.

406
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:29,400
It is therefore a right of
inequality and it's content light.

407
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,810
Every other right,

408
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:36,510
right by its very nature can consist
only in the application of an equal

409
00:28:36,511 --> 00:28:39,390
standard but unequal individuals.

410
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,960
And they would not be different
individuals if they were not unequal.

411
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:48,220
A measurable only by an equal standard
insofar as they're brought under an equal

412
00:28:48,751 --> 00:28:53,490
point of view, uh, taken from one
definite side only for instance,

413
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:58,491
in the present case or regarding only as
work and as as nothing more is seen in

414
00:28:58,981 --> 00:29:02,700
them.
Everything else being ignored further,

415
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:07,140
one worker is married, another
is not, one has children,

416
00:29:07,141 --> 00:29:09,930
more children than another
and so on and so forth.

417
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:15,410
Thus with an equal performance of labor
and Henson and equal in the social

418
00:29:16,411 --> 00:29:17,550
consumption fund,

419
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:22,790
one will in fact received
more than another one will
be richer than another and

420
00:29:22,951 --> 00:29:23,784
so on.

421
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:29,070
So if you think about a system in which
there's no longer a capitalist but

422
00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:31,980
people are rewarded on the basis of work,

423
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:37,700
there's still going to be an equality
because some people have more effective

424
00:29:37,801 --> 00:29:42,801
capacities to work than others and because
some have diff have more demands on

425
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:48,040
them than others. If you have more
children to feed than somebody else,

426
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:53,020
earning the same amount is going
to leave you relatively worse off.

427
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:58,490
So socialism is not a condition of
equality because there is this right based

428
00:29:59,321 --> 00:30:00,730
upon labor

429
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:08,320
and he says these defects are inevitable
and the first phase of a communist

430
00:30:08,421 --> 00:30:12,050
society, which is socialism,
they're inevitable

431
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:18,530
as it as it is when it is
just emerged off the block.

432
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,430
Prolong Birth Cat Pang from
capitalist society right,

433
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:26,240
can never be higher than the economic
structure of society and its cultural

434
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,440
development condition.

435
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:32,620
Their buy in a higher phase of
communist society after the enslaving

436
00:30:32,781 --> 00:30:35,750
subordination of the individual
to the division of labor.

437
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:40,220
And there with also the antithesis
between mental and physical Labor has

438
00:30:40,221 --> 00:30:45,080
vanished after Labor has become not
only a means of life, but life's prime.

439
00:30:45,081 --> 00:30:50,081
One after the productive
forces have increased with
the all round development of

440
00:30:50,301 --> 00:30:54,650
the individual and the springs of
cooperative wealth law more abundantly,

441
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:59,920
only then can the narrow horizon and
a bourgeois right be crossed in its

442
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:01,130
entirety.

443
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:06,490
And Society subscribe on its banners from
each according to his ability to each

444
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,560
according to his needs,

445
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,480
from each according to his ability
to each according to his needs.

446
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:19,810
That is the definition of the
distributor principle under communism.

447
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,850
Whereas under socialism,

448
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:27,830
it's from each according to his
ability to each according to his work.

449
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:37,820
So socialism is not hypocritical with
respect to the the workmanship ideal

450
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:41,550
because unlike capitalism, the workers
getting rewarded for their work,

451
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:46,620
but it's still an unequal society
because people are differently abled and

452
00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:49,340
people have different demands to meet.
Uh,

453
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:54,370
and so finally we have to get to the
abolition of the very idea of rights in

454
00:31:56,071 --> 00:32:01,071
order to get to the communist idea of
from each according to his ability to each

455
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:06,990
according to his need.
So that's the Marxian story.

456
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:10,770
I'm sorry I put such long quotations
up there, but I think you,

457
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:15,180
you need them to get a flavor of how he
was actually thinking about it. Th the,

458
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,610
these interaction crises,

459
00:32:17,611 --> 00:32:20,910
all of them making one another
worst declining profits,

460
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:25,980
a liquidity crisis, more and
more militant workers, um,

461
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:31,080
and, and so on and so forth. Finally,
you get an increase in consciousness.

462
00:32:31,081 --> 00:32:34,680
The socialists takeover.
It's still an unequal system,

463
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:38,980
but it has the capacity
for super abundance,

464
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,810
for cooperative wealth
to flow more abundantly.

465
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,080
And so we can abolish the idea of right
completely and just distribute on the

466
00:32:49,731 --> 00:32:51,950
basis of needs.

467
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,593
Now

468
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:01,200
I want to start digging into
this in a critical way, um,

469
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,320
to show you all of the things
that are wrong with it.

470
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,520
But this is in the spirit of
how we treated utilitarianism.

471
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:13,020
Uh, that is to say we're going to see
all of the things that are wrong with his

472
00:33:13,021 --> 00:33:17,760
argument in the same way that we did with
Bentham and mill in order then to see

473
00:33:17,761 --> 00:33:20,010
if there's any surviving intuition.

474
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:23,790
And I want to start with
this concept of needs.

475
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,580
One of the reasons

476
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,780
Marx and his followers,

477
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,540
we're so focused on needs

478
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,230
was that they were convinced that
in order to keep itself going,

479
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:47,470
capitalism,
manufacturers

480
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:54,170
pseudo wants all the time. We
already saw this, this problem.

481
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:57,230
You know, there's this problem
with insufficient demand.

482
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,760
You've got to get people to want things.
You've got to get people to believe,

483
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:06,230
you know,
if you don't have the latest,

484
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,390
whatever it is,
you're a schmuck.

485
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,750
Uh,
you know,

486
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,410
my son, you know, looks at my
blackberry tour and he says,

487
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:20,480
how can you use a phone like that?
Nobody uses those anymore.

488
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:24,170
You've got to have a Google phone, right?
And if you don't have a Google phone,

489
00:34:24,171 --> 00:34:28,520
you're just a complete loser.
That's his view of the matter. Uh,

490
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,850
and because there's this problem,
weak demand,

491
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:36,680
this is built in emphasis to constantly
manufacturer demand fourth and things

492
00:34:36,681 --> 00:34:37,850
that nobody needs.

493
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,720
But the impulse to create all of these,

494
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,870
these phony needs will go away.

495
00:34:47,871 --> 00:34:50,600
Why don't you don't need
capitalism to innovate?

496
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,190
So why don't you don't have capitalism.

497
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:57,140
You don't need people to constantly
think that they have to have the latest

498
00:34:57,141 --> 00:35:02,030
Gizmo. You don't need to try and get
people to think, you know, of the,

499
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,800
of the 27 kinds of, um, dishwashing
liquid in stop and shop.

500
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,320
This one's better than that one.
Um,

501
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,800
all of these manufactured artificial
needs are an artifact of the problem that

502
00:35:15,261 --> 00:35:18,680
we have to keep capitalism going.
And once that goes away,

503
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,250
we can think about people
having finite needs.

504
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:28,560
And so if society late reaches
a certain level of abundance,

505
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,770
then those needs can be met.

506
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:39,810
Who thinks that's a terrible
argument? Okay. What's bad about it?

507
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,213
Take,
take the,

508
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,173
yeah.
Yeah.

509
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:53,170
It just doesn't seem like a good model
of human nature puts a limit on how much

510
00:35:53,171 --> 00:35:57,520
you can want it. What it puts a limit
on how much you can want. And it makes,

511
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,970
it seems like everyone has to
want the same amount of things.

512
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,280
Okay. Why else? That I think that was a
good point. What else is wrong with it?

513
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:12,700
I mean, it is surely it's true
that some of the things, you know,

514
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,730
there is a difference between
wants and needs. Right?

515
00:36:15,731 --> 00:36:20,060
And a lot of our wants are very
frivolous, right? You're not, you,

516
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,700
there are a lot of things do we want,

517
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,830
I mean the neoclassical system doesn't
differentiate because it's all,

518
00:36:26,831 --> 00:36:31,780
we don't allow interpersonal judgments
of utility, right? So, uh, you know,

519
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:36,930
Trump thinks that he needs the next
$100 million and you might say he might,

520
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,550
he might want it, but
he doesn't need it. But

521
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,090
what's wrong with,
you know,

522
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,010
I'm just wanting you to elaborate
on what he was saying. Well,

523
00:36:49,011 --> 00:36:52,150
somebody else to elaborate on,
on what she was saying. Yeah,

524
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,180
no.

525
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:00,350
How the government will decide what
people need and what they just want.

526
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,230
You're,
you're,

527
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:06,340
you're troubled by the idea of that
government deciding what people will need

528
00:37:06,341 --> 00:37:09,940
and want. They just want, I think
that's fair enough. But you know,

529
00:37:09,941 --> 00:37:13,900
I think Marx and his most
utopian moments after all,

530
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:18,040
one of the differences between social
zone communism is there is no government

531
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:22,690
under communism is a withering away
of the state. So his idea I think,

532
00:37:22,691 --> 00:37:27,130
is this just going to be all the super,
these, you know, all these goodies.

533
00:37:27,131 --> 00:37:29,410
Every people,
we'll just take what they need.

534
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:33,160
Where does the abundance come from also?
That's another problem.

535
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,830
Where is it? It's been made
possible by capitalism. The they,

536
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,230
the productivity of cap,

537
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,610
it gets used up and then there is
no more capitalism to create more.

538
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,440
Okay.
So you're saying it'll,

539
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:52,420
we might go to super abundance
but then go fall back from it. So,

540
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:57,260
uh, yeah, those, those, uh, I
think those are good criticism.

541
00:37:57,261 --> 00:38:01,630
So why will there be continuing abundance?
I think that's a fair criticism.

542
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:02,710
Um,

543
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:07,210
but I think there's a more fundamental
problem with it and that is

544
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:14,050
in distinguishing wants from needs.
You could say luck,

545
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:18,100
you know,
even before you get to those problems,

546
00:38:18,101 --> 00:38:20,860
which you both raise
serious questions for it.

547
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:25,300
But even before you get to those
question, somebody might say, look,

548
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:31,710
we can at least define needs by what
people require in order to survive.

549
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,980
Surely if we want

550
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,400
to distinguish one's from needs,
we,

551
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,770
we make a distinction between
things that if you don't get them,

552
00:38:41,771 --> 00:38:46,150
you're going to die versus things
that if you don't get them,

553
00:38:46,151 --> 00:38:50,980
you might not be that happy,
but you're not going to die.
What about that? Is that,

554
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:54,280
who thinks that that would
solve Marxists problem?

555
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,153
Anybody?

556
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,660
Why wouldn't it? Who thinks it
wouldn't? You just said, you know,

557
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:08,840
we've got to reach a level of productivity
where we can produce what people in

558
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,650
need in order to survive

559
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:16,540
and then we could get rid of the
regime of rights. And you know, he,

560
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:21,541
I think Mark's makes a very valid point
when he says any regime of riots is a

561
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,630
regime of inequality.
Yeah.

562
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:28,460
Well I think there's kind of keeping
with the same thing they had during, um,

563
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,760
capitalism. Like if it's
still just subsistence level,
if that's what you need.

564
00:39:32,761 --> 00:39:37,050
And that's the same thing the workers
had under capitalism is not really making

565
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,570
the communism a better
society for the people.

566
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,850
Okay. So you're saying, oh,

567
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,380
a world in which people only meet their
needs may not be a better world. Yeah.

568
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:52,790
Okay. I think that might be
a fact, a fair criticism.

569
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,350
He wants to say the alternative is that
we're all like these rats on wheels

570
00:39:57,351 --> 00:40:00,380
running faster and faster
to get, um, you know,

571
00:40:00,381 --> 00:40:03,830
less and less benefit.
So the,

572
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,700
that and last we can accept
finitude that, you know, we,

573
00:40:08,701 --> 00:40:13,580
we live for a fixed time
and, and uh, we, we,

574
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:18,200
if we, if we can't come to
grips with the fact that, um,

575
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:22,340
we are finite creatures,
we're never going to be happy.

576
00:40:22,341 --> 00:40:25,160
So I think that's the debate that
he would want to have with you.

577
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:30,050
But I think that that even within
Marx's own terms of reference,

578
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:35,510
this a, this a different
problem and that that is this.

579
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:41,480
Suppose you said, all right. We all grant
you as a matter of the philosophy on it.

580
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,550
We'll grant you the proposition.

581
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:48,580
We'll grant you call marks the proposition
that needs are defined by what is

582
00:40:48,951 --> 00:40:52,010
necessary for people's
survival and that they,

583
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:57,060
they should somehow be more important
than and Trump frivolous once that might

584
00:40:59,271 --> 00:41:02,000
make life better. But still, you know,

585
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:07,210
still an all making my life better
by letting me have a nice car is less

586
00:41:07,491 --> 00:41:11,690
important than preventing somebody from
starving when it really gets down to it.

587
00:41:11,691 --> 00:41:16,520
And so we could make this distinction
between needs and wants in that sense.

588
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,500
But here's the problem.

589
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:25,060
Even if we're only trying to meet people's
needs defined in that narrow sense of

590
00:41:28,431 --> 00:41:33,050
keeping people alive,
there's still and Damick scarcity.

591
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,000
This notion of super abundance
doesn't make any sense.

592
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:40,220
Just think about it for a minute.

593
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,970
Money that we spend on

594
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,630
dialysis machines

595
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:54,130
is money that we don't spend on
heart transplants or aids research.

596
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,600
So no matter what,

597
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:05,870
no matter how much wealth there is this
still distributed choices to make and

598
00:42:06,331 --> 00:42:10,740
this society, there's still gonna be the
problem that we're going to say, wow,

599
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:20,700
if we choose to to to protect needs a,

600
00:42:21,641 --> 00:42:21,861
B,

601
00:42:21,861 --> 00:42:26,800
and c that need anyone who needs
dialysis should get free dialysis.

602
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:31,570
Then in, you know, whether we make it
explicit or implicit beside the point,

603
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,860
somebody who needs something else to
keep them alive is not going to get it.

604
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,560
We're not going to do research on cancer
because we are doing spending that next

605
00:42:41,561 --> 00:42:45,820
marginal dollar doing research on um,

606
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:51,820
the causes of AIDS. Um, so why,

607
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:56,850
why don't you see that point then
the notion of super abundance becomes

608
00:42:57,521 --> 00:42:58,354
incoherent.

609
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:02,710
There is no such thing as super
abundance and without super abundance,

610
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:07,890
you can't get a world beyond entitlements,

611
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:11,560
right?
But it explicit or implicit,

612
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:14,830
you're never going to transcend
the world of scarcity.

613
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:20,890
Why don't you see that that meeting
needs even defined in this minimal way of

614
00:43:21,851 --> 00:43:26,851
what's necessary to keep people
alive re involves trade offs.

615
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:32,080
What you're really saying is that scarcity
is endemic to the human condition.

616
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
And this is the deepest analytical
floor in Marx's normative theory.

617
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,580
Because once you say that scarcity
is endemic to the human condition,

618
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:48,430
you can't get away from
distributor of conflict.

619
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,570
You've got to find some way,
whether it's a system of rights,

620
00:43:52,571 --> 00:43:53,740
whether it's the market,

621
00:43:53,741 --> 00:43:58,620
where it's the government making
decisions about who needs what, um,

622
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:03,100
somebody or some mechanism is
gonna make those decisions,

623
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:04,031
right?

624
00:44:04,031 --> 00:44:09,031
So you reach the proposition that scarcity
is endemic to the human condition and

625
00:44:10,331 --> 00:44:13,870
you have to reason about what makes sense.

626
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:18,400
Taking that for granted.
Anyway,

627
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:23,410
it's ironic that Marx was so blind to
this because Mark's was the person who

628
00:44:24,921 --> 00:44:28,790
said human nature is not static
and evolves through history.

629
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,280
We develop and change.
Um,

630
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,270
and so you would think he of all people
would see that the, the fact that,

631
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,180
you know,
in 1886,

632
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:43,950
the natural life expectancy
was whatever it was, 46 years.

633
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:49,170
Why that shouldn't be taken as a given
or the biblical three score years and 10

634
00:44:49,171 --> 00:44:52,530
be taken as a given for that matter.
Um,

635
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:57,830
but you will never reach a condition
in which scarcity can be transcended.

636
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,840
And that's the ultimate
hope behind his utopianism.

637
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:07,860
So it's not that I disagree with
any of the points you folks made.

638
00:45:07,861 --> 00:45:09,720
I think they're all correct.
The other,

639
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,570
there are other reasons
that you would question it,

640
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:16,200
but the reason this
particular, uh, argument,

641
00:45:16,201 --> 00:45:21,201
I think cuts at the roots of his
theory is that it's the most favorable

642
00:45:21,451 --> 00:45:24,330
interpretation of his account of needs,
right?

643
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:28,140
There's no more favorable interpretation
than limiting them to survival.

644
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:32,310
And even on that account,
we can't,

645
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:35,550
we can't get to a world
of super abundance.

646
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:38,850
We will always live in
a world of scarcity.

647
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,880
And that means that whatever you have to
say about distribution has to take that

648
00:45:46,261 --> 00:45:50,880
for granted. This is, this is as I think,

649
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:55,881
as powerful at point as the point we
made when we came to the end of our

650
00:45:57,151 --> 00:46:01,650
discussion of mill to the effect that
you can't get the politics out of the

651
00:46:01,651 --> 00:46:03,720
definition of harm,
right?

652
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,670
There's no neutral way to define harm.
Uh,

653
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:12,330
another way of thinking about this is it's
a way of trying to transcend politics,

654
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:17,730
right? One of angles, not
marks, but nevermind, uh,

655
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,080
angles was,
um,

656
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:25,930
stating a Marxian and view was that the,

657
00:46:25,931 --> 00:46:30,931
the great thing about a socialism and
communism is that politics gets displaced

658
00:46:31,921 --> 00:46:32,970
by administration.

659
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,070
That you don't have to worry
about distributive conflict
in this story because

660
00:46:38,071 --> 00:46:42,590
there's super abundance,
right? And in mills account,

661
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:45,960
you don't have to worry about the
definition of harm in his case because

662
00:46:45,961 --> 00:46:50,580
there'll be a neutral scientific
account. Uh, neither of them works.

663
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:56,180
So we have a world in which they have to
be political choices about distributed

664
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,600
questions.
Some say leave it to the market,

665
00:47:00,601 --> 00:47:03,080
but that is itself a political choice.
We'll,

666
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:06,060
we'll have more to say about that.

667
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:08,490
So that's the,

668
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:14,690
the beginning of the end of Marxism is
I think the recognition that scarcity is

669
00:47:16,051 --> 00:47:19,550
endemic to the human condition.
Um,

670
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:24,890
what we will do on Wednesday is explore
and unpack some other difficulties with

671
00:47:25,531 --> 00:47:27,900
his argument and then see where the,

672
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:31,500
and what the remaining insights might be.
See you then.
