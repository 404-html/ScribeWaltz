1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,740
We're going to start today by
talking about the enlightenment.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,610
And I want to offer one,
uh,

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,970
prefatory caution about any way of
dividing up the history of ideas anyway of

4
00:00:15,361 --> 00:00:19,440
period Ising if you like
the history of ideas,

5
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:24,090
which is that there's no single
right way to do that. And indeed,

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,640
uh,
anyway,

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,770
you do it obscures in some
ways important things.

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,850
So for example,

9
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:37,851
sometimes people dry it divide up the
history of western political thought into

10
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:42,870
the ancients and the moderns and the
ancients asserts thought to have certain

11
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:47,871
characteristic preoccupations that
change around sometime around the 16th

12
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:53,511
century with Macchia valley or was or in
the 17th century with some of the folks

13
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:56,460
we're going to be talking about today.

14
00:00:56,461 --> 00:01:00,480
And so we get this picture presented
that there's a fundamental difference

15
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:04,080
between ancients and moderns.
On the other hand,

16
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,290
another way of dividing up the history
of the tradition is between naturalists

17
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,940
and anti naturalists.
So natural as some people who think that,

18
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,103
uh,

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,200
understanding nature and understanding
human nature is the key to political

20
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,060
theorizing. Whereas Auntie naturalists
look for something else, whether it's,

21
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,090
um, God's law or transcendental, um,

22
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,650
platonic forms or something like that.

23
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,750
And so we can have a division
of the tradition in, in, uh,

24
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:44,751
between naturalists who generally trace
all the way back to Aristotle and anti

25
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:48,570
naturalists to trace all
the way back to Plato.

26
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,110
It's not that the distinction between
naturalists and anti naturalists is better

27
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,100
or, or more accurate than the
distinction between ancients and moderns.

28
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,020
It's just a different kind of distinction
that highlights different features of

29
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:06,960
these thinkers, um,
for different purposes.

30
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,270
So I just say that as a caution because
now we're focusing on the enlightenment

31
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,600
as a characteristic move in
western political thinking
that really starts in the

32
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:21,930
17th century and comes into
its own in the 18th century.

33
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,800
But I don't want you to reify that idea.
Um,

34
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,380
these enlightenment thinkers we're
talking about do in fact have important,

35
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,780
um, points of continuity with
many evil and ancient thinkers,

36
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,520
um, some of which will come up
in our discussions. Nonetheless,

37
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:46,521
I think it's useful to focus on the
enlightenment as a distinctive turn in

38
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:48,480
western political thinking.

39
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,350
And that's going to structure
our discussion going forward.

40
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,480
And the first three traditions we're
going to consider in this course,

41
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,710
namely utilitarianism,

42
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,920
Marxism and the social contract are
all variants of enlightenment thinking.

43
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,640
But before we get into the nitty
gritty of those traditions,

44
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:14,850
I want us today to take a step back
and think more generally about what the

45
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:17,710
enlightenment was.

46
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:22,711
What this enlightenment move is that
I'm pointing to as setting the outer

47
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:28,741
philosophical boundaries of these first
three traditions that we're going to be

48
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,690
considering starting next Wednesday.

49
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:33,570
Okay.

50
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,240
And as I said in my introductory lecture,

51
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,810
the enlightenment really evolves at
twin commitment as far as politics is

52
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:42,654
concerned.

53
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,200
And that is to first and foremost a
commitment to science as the basis for

54
00:03:48,301 --> 00:03:51,030
theorizing about politics,

55
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:56,470
a commitment to science rather than a
commitment to tradition or religion or a

56
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:04,200
revelation or um,
anything else.

57
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,480
Um, rather the idea was
that the, that science,

58
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,553
um,

59
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,030
is going to provide the right incentives
for thinking about the correct

60
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:18,000
political organization of society.

61
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:24,110
And secondly that the core political
value for enlightenment thinkers is this

62
00:04:28,321 --> 00:04:33,321
notion of individual freedom
to be operationalized or
realized through a doctor

63
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,650
doctrine of the rights of the individual.

64
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,160
We'll see a shortly that one of the
distinctive moves of the 17th century ride

65
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,140
is about politics,

66
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:51,350
is that they stopped talking so much about
natural law and start instead to talk

67
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:53,970
about natural rights,

68
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:59,270
the rights of the individual to realize
their purposes through politics.

69
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,150
And so the enlightenment,
as I said,

70
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:07,560
revolves around this twin commitment to
the idea of importance of science as the

71
00:05:07,561 --> 00:05:12,561
basis for theorizing and the importance
of individual freedoms realized through

72
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,040
a doctrine of individual rights.

73
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,430
And we're going to use John Locke as
a window into this early enlightenment

74
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,630
thinking separately,

75
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:29,631
initially from his role as one of the
early social contract theorists that will

76
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,960
be dealing with in a few weeks.
Um,

77
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:39,170
but first we're going to
focus on this idea of science.

78
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:46,300
Now let's think about what science is,
what it's all about.

79
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:51,301
I have three diagnostic questions
here and the reason I put them up,

80
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,240
we'll become playing in a second.

81
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,360
It has to do with the fact that
the early enlightenment theorists,

82
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:04,390
the 17th century theorists thought
that the hallmark of genuine knowledge,

83
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,540
the hallmark of science was certainty.

84
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:14,350
You might all have come across in
one philosophy course or another.

85
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:20,360
The famous car Tz and idea
Descartes' idea. Does anybody,

86
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,530
anyone read Descartes who can
tell us what is most famous for?

87
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,213
Okay.

88
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,000
The what?
The Calgary Tower did you say?

89
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,050
Yeah, Descartes. What? What was his idea?

90
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,960
Systematic doubt. W you're
dead, right? Why? Why did,

91
00:06:49,961 --> 00:06:53,080
why was he interested in doubting things?
Anybody.

92
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,960
Why did they card?
This is a,

93
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,650
this is a bonus question cause
stay card is not on the syllabus,

94
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,240
but why was he interested in China
about things? What was he looking for?

95
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,913
Yeah,

96
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,810
he was looking for what you
can truly be certain about it.

97
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,880
Exactly.

98
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:16,210
He was looking for absolute certainty
that the hallmark of genuine knowledge is

99
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:17,301
certainty.

100
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:21,740
So it's asking himself what is it
that we can have certainty about?

101
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:26,060
And as you probably now, Descartes
had his own answer to that question.

102
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:30,650
What was it? I think therefore
I am correct. I am a Yaley.

103
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:35,210
Therefore I am right. Yeah.
I think therefore I am.

104
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,960
And he thought he,
they card thought this was an,

105
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:44,050
this was said particular
kind of proposition because
the very act of trying to

106
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:49,010
doubt it affirmed. You
couldn't, you couldn't direct,

107
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,000
you know,

108
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,780
and so that was what the early
enlightenment theorists we're looking for.

109
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,370
What is it that makes knowledge
certain puts it beyond doubt.

110
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:03,730
And so I've got up here three propositions
and we could say the sum of the

111
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:10,340
Interior angles of a
triangle equals 180 degrees.

112
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,540
Okay.

113
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,110
How many people think that that
proposition can be known with certainty?

114
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,350
Yeah, a lot. I mean, how would
you try and doubt it? You know,

115
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:25,700
you could measure one triangle measured
the next triangle, measure third.

116
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,710
You know, after you had measured
5,604 triangles, you'd start to say,

117
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,300
hmm, maybe there's a theorem
here. Maybe this, you know,

118
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:37,400
it's not as if the,
the,

119
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:42,430
the next triangle I find is going to turn
out not to add up to 108 it's just not

120
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:44,630
going to happen. Right. We know.

121
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:49,780
And that's what we've come to refer to
in modern philosophical thinking as a

122
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:54,290
priore knowledge. If follows from
the nature of the definitions,

123
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,760
nature of the terms

124
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,630
that,
um,

125
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,810
the proposition of force campie down,

126
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,940
it's all if we say a bachelor
is an unmarried man, you know,

127
00:09:09,941 --> 00:09:13,900
you're not going to go and start looking
at bachelor after bachelor to see if

128
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:18,720
you can find a married bachelor. There's
no such thing as a married bachelor.

129
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:23,721
So those propositions we tend to think
of today as analytic propositions.

130
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:28,480
They follow analytically from
the definitions of the terms,

131
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:29,740
uh,

132
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:34,030
at issue or in a true this of mathematics.

133
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:39,031
It seems there's a theorem that tells
you it must be the case that the sum of

134
00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:42,850
the interior angles of a
triangle add up to 180 degrees.

135
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,020
When we say come to what
I've numbered to here,

136
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,800
how many people think that that
can be known with certainty?

137
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,260
Some of you do.
Anyone not so sure.

138
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,660
Why? Why are you unsure? Where's the
microphone? What's the source of your,

139
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,810
your your doubt? Yeah. Okay.

140
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,560
Well, it seems like, um,

141
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,510
in terms of geology when we weren't able
to penetrate what was underneath the

142
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:19,680
earth for a long period of time and the
knowledge of tectonic plates even was a

143
00:10:19,681 --> 00:10:23,100
new or more modern,
um, discovery, I guess.

144
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,820
Right?
So I think that's exactly right.

145
00:10:25,821 --> 00:10:30,410
The current bashed empirical understanding
of earthquakes is that it's the

146
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:34,880
movement of tectonic plates. But we
might, you know, science might advance,

147
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,310
there might be changes in
geology, uh, which, which,

148
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,340
which might lead us eventually
to learn. Well, yes,

149
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,360
some earthquakes result from
10 tonic plate movement,

150
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,570
but other earthquakes might
result from something else.

151
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:52,430
All we will learn that something moves
the tectonic plates that we don't

152
00:10:52,431 --> 00:10:57,200
currently know about. This is an
ongoing process of empirical discovery,

153
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,880
right? It's, it's not the,

154
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,860
it's not a proposition that follows from
the nature of the terms and these we

155
00:11:03,861 --> 00:11:08,540
call empirical propositions in Mar,
in modern philosophy of science. Um,

156
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:12,920
sometimes they called,
if you like the fancy Latin terminology,

157
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,100
a pastaria. Right. As opposed to a priore.

158
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,050
They're not analytical propositions.
Right.

159
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:24,250
They had their result of observation
and trying to figure out what the causes

160
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:29,180
are behind those phenomena.
So generally speaking,

161
00:11:29,181 --> 00:11:34,160
they don't have the same kind of
force as analytic propositions.

162
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,020
What about this third one?

163
00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:39,980
Consent is the basis for
political legitimacy.

164
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,240
Anyone think that can
be known with certainty?

165
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,350
Nobody.
I think that's right.

166
00:11:51,351 --> 00:11:52,760
Most people would say,
wow,

167
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:57,761
that's a moral or a normative
judgment of some kind.

168
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:00,820
Maybe people agree with it,
maybe they don't,

169
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,120
but certainly it's not a
scientific proposition,

170
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,950
at least not obviously a
scientific proposition. Indeed.

171
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:13,360
Even if we, you know, even if we
took a, just in a descriptive sense,

172
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:17,830
not to mean consent should be the
basis of political legitimacy,

173
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,540
but as a descriptive matter about
regimes, some people would say, wow,

174
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,090
maybe regimes are based on consent,

175
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:28,030
but maybe some regimes
are based on other things.

176
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,720
Maybe they're based on
claims to divine authority.

177
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,430
Maybe that based on utilitarianism,
we're going to talk about that next week.

178
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,750
So it seems even as a descriptive matter,

179
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,860
never mind as a normative matter.

180
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:47,010
This is not a scientific proposition in
the way that a causal statements about

181
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:52,801
the world I scientific propositions and
certainly not in the way that analytical

182
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:59,070
statements about the world
can have scientific certainty
so we could spend more

183
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:06,361
time on this and there I did nuances
in modern conceptions of science that I

184
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:13,051
haven't gotten to that would paint a
more complex picture of the differences

185
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:15,820
among these three propositions.

186
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:20,260
But what I want to draw your
attention to now is that in the early

187
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:21,160
enlightenment,

188
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,820
17th century thinkers about the
nature of Science Day card and his

189
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:33,270
contemporaries thought very
differently about science.

190
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,120
Indeed
in the early enlightenment,

191
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:44,870
they would have agreed that the sum of
interior angles of a triangle equals 180

192
00:13:44,971 --> 00:13:48,690
degrees is a proposition that
can be known with certainty.

193
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,700
But interestingly,

194
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,110
they would have this claim
here in the same category.

195
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,680
They would have put this claim about
consent in the same category with

196
00:14:01,681 --> 00:14:06,681
propositions about mathematics
propositions behind which
there's a theorem as we

197
00:14:08,101 --> 00:14:08,841
just said,

198
00:14:08,841 --> 00:14:13,350
but when we're talking about triangles
and they would have relegated empirical

199
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:15,060
and causal claims

200
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,000
to an inferior status.

201
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,390
Now you might think that is pretty weird,

202
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,640
at least prima facie that seems pretty
weird and in order to get your mind into

203
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:35,700
the world in which they lived,

204
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,480
you have to suspend disbelief for a moment
about your concept of science and try

205
00:14:43,971 --> 00:14:48,830
to get your mind around early
enlightenment conceptions of science which

206
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,930
involved thinking very different me.

207
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:56,170
The reason is that only enlightenment
thinkers wouldn't say that this is certain

208
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,830
because of the meanings of the words,

209
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:06,070
but rather it's certain because
this an act of well behind it.

210
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,350
Now this may sound even weirder
than anything I've said so far,

211
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,640
but consider

212
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:20,670
consider this passage here written by
Thomas Hobbs who is riding in the middle

213
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:26,221
of the 17th century in his in a minor
piece that he wrote the six lessons for

214
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:31,540
the professors of mathematics.
It's just not one of Hobbs is major works,

215
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,613
but I think it's,

216
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,880
it's one of the most succinct
descriptions I've ever seen of the early

217
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:40,420
enlightenment conception of science.
He says of the arts,

218
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:44,620
which for him is a general
term to capture knowledge.

219
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:49,780
He says some are demonstrably others
are in demonstrable and demonstrable.

220
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:52,720
Are those the construction
of where of the subject,

221
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,700
the construction of the subject,

222
00:15:54,701 --> 00:15:59,701
where are is in the power of the artist
himself who in his demonstration does

223
00:16:01,631 --> 00:16:05,770
know more about the deduce the
consequences off his own operation.

224
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,800
The way the reason we're,
I've is this,

225
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,280
that the science of every subject is
derived from a pre cognition of the causes

226
00:16:14,351 --> 00:16:16,780
generation and construction of the same.

227
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,440
And consequently where
the courses are known,

228
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:25,950
there is place for demonstration but
not where the courses are to seek for

229
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,960
geometry.
Therefore,

230
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:34,961
it's demonstrably wall for the lines and
figures from which we reason are drawn

231
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:39,650
and described by ourselves.
We make the triangle.

232
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,503
Okay.

233
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:47,020
And civil philosophy is demands trouble
because we make the Commonwealth

234
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,200
ourselves.
Okay.

235
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:56,201
So this is the key to this what seems
like a very weird conception of political

236
00:16:57,711 --> 00:17:01,940
philosophy as equivalent to um,
mathematics.

237
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,190
Civil Philosophy.

238
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:07,700
It's demonstrably cause we
make the Commonwealth House
House bought off natural

239
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:12,680
bodies. We know not the construction,
but seek it from the effects.

240
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,160
There lies no demonstration of
what the causes B we seek for,

241
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:22,670
but only what they may be,
only what they may be.

242
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,640
There's not going to be
certainty about earthquakes,

243
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:30,500
about the courses are earthquake.
We can make a probabilistic judgment,

244
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,460
we can make empirical claims,
but at the end of the day,

245
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,910
those claims are fallible.
That car at your ball,

246
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,940
they might have to be revised in the face
of future knowledge and science is not

247
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,780
going to ever reach to the level of
certainty with propositions of that sword.

248
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,120
And so this is why,
going back to this,

249
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:58,050
I did this ordering of these
street propositions on,

250
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,640
on a Hobbsy and view,

251
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,630
these two are equivalent not
because of anything about their,

252
00:18:05,631 --> 00:18:06,960
I'm so analytics,

253
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,130
but rather because this will centerdness.
They're the product of the,

254
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,330
of human conscious action.

255
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,600
We make the triangle and
we make the Commonwealth.

256
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:24,080
And so we have privileged access
into the what goes into that making.

257
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:29,640
But we,
we don't make the planet.

258
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:34,670
God made the planet and we
can only observe the effects
of earthquakes and then

259
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:38,700
try and guess about their causes.
Right?

260
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,910
So
when we come to John Locke,

261
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,800
who is a at one with Hobbes
on this point about knowledge,

262
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:57,140
the term I want to use to capture this
early enlightenment conception of science

263
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,200
is the workmanship ideal,
right?

264
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,250
Rather than a priore or
analytic, uh, knowledge.

265
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:10,251
We're going to talk about knowledge in
terms of this idea of workmanship maker's

266
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,533
knowledge.

267
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:19,010
And it's important to realize
that in its ultimate foundations,

268
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,870
this is actually a theological
proposition, both for Hobbs.

269
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:28,930
We're going to leave hubs
behind now because you didn't
read him and we're going

270
00:19:28,931 --> 00:19:32,750
to focus on lock. But as I
said, they have, they have, um,

271
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,090
the same view on this particular question.

272
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:42,020
So God has intimate knowledge of
the universe because he created it.

273
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:50,200
Okay.
And that is this,

274
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:54,610
this idea that making is a
source of knowledge, right?

275
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:59,000
So God knows God knows the
causes of earthquakes because he,

276
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:03,070
he made the earth. We don't because
we didn't make the art, but we can,

277
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,640
we can have God like knowledge of what
we create because God gave us the power

278
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:16,840
to create things. So this is in the
first instance, a theological argument.

279
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,900
Okay? So we are like miniature gods
with respect to what we create.

280
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:27,930
We have the same kind of make as knowledge
over what we create as God has over

281
00:20:29,471 --> 00:20:34,150
what he created.
Now there are some constraints on our

282
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:40,790
kind I'll kinds of knowing
because we are also made by God.

283
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:43,880
And I were to get to that in a minute.
But what he,

284
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:48,760
what he did for human beings that he
didn't do for any aspect of creation

285
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:54,030
unlocks taling is that he gave
us this creative capacity.

286
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:54,670
Ah,

287
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:59,620
he gave us the capacity to behave
like miniature gods in the world.

288
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:03,340
And I'll come back to that.
Um, but I did want to,

289
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:06,580
to alert you to the fact that Phil Laak,

290
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,120
this was actually something now,
but tormenting idea. Um, we'll have,

291
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,510
we'll see a lot more about locked later.

292
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,880
But one of the most important
things you need to remember,

293
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:22,810
route lock is that he
was a Tomez. It was, uh,

294
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:26,020
a believing Christian
theologians throughout his life.

295
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,800
And there was a huge debate
that had gone on actually for,

296
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:36,520
uh, two centuries before Locke
wrote, among theologians.

297
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,430
And this was the puzzle that
they were worried about.

298
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,020
The question was,

299
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:49,460
can God change natural law?

300
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,690
If you said no,

301
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,540
that would suggest that
God is not omnipotent.

302
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,910
But if you said yes,

303
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:10,300
that would suggest that natural law
is not a system of timeless universals

304
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,540
because if God could change natural law,
maybe it's going to,

305
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,460
he'll choose to change it tomorrow.

306
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,070
And as we were talking
about, uh, on Wednesday,

307
00:22:21,071 --> 00:22:25,450
remember when somebody asks me
about, uh, legal positivism,

308
00:22:25,451 --> 00:22:30,040
I said that, uh, that was a doctrine
red rejected the idea of natural law.

309
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:35,041
The idea of natural law was that there
are some timeless universals that weekend

310
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,091
appeal to,

311
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:42,091
to judge actual political institutions
so we can appeal to natural law and the

312
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:44,320
context or the icon problem.

313
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:48,010
We were discussing to say
that Nazi Germany was a,

314
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:52,150
was an evil regime
right?

315
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:56,410
By we appeal to this high end natural law.
Well lock had been concerned about,

316
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,790
uh,
this,

317
00:22:57,791 --> 00:23:02,791
this theological problem with natural
law that if you say it's a timeless

318
00:23:04,181 --> 00:23:09,181
universal that seems to undermine the
idea of God's omnipotence because God

319
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:12,230
can't be an all powerful,
um,

320
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:13,950
okay

321
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:18,550
Vega, but are if on the other
hand you say, well, God, uh,

322
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:24,260
can change natural law then that that
undermines its possible universality and

323
00:23:25,561 --> 00:23:27,030
lock struggled with this.

324
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:32,070
If you become experts on the 17th century
and you go back and read his essays on

325
00:23:32,071 --> 00:23:35,940
the law of nature written in the 1660s,
uh,

326
00:23:35,941 --> 00:23:40,710
you'll see him really torturing
himself, uh, as to how to resolve this.

327
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,750
He never really resolved that.

328
00:23:42,751 --> 00:23:47,390
But in the end he came down on what we're
going to call the, the command theory,

329
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:49,250
the workman ship ship theory,

330
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:52,580
the well based theory that he said,

331
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:57,910
we have to say that God is omnipotent
and let the chips fall where they may for

332
00:23:58,431 --> 00:24:02,360
the timelessness of a natural law.

333
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,700
It was never entirely comfortable with it,

334
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:09,710
but he couldn't let go of that proposition
for reasons I've already alluded to

335
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,790
that he thought something
couldn't have the,

336
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:17,720
the force of a law without
being the product of a will.

337
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:23,260
And so it's God's well that's the basis
of natural law and God's case and God's

338
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,670
knowledge,
uh,

339
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:29,690
office creation is traced back to this,

340
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,890
this idea of the workmanship
ideal maker's knowledge.

341
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,550
So God has make us
knowledge of his creation.

342
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:42,950
We're going to see, uh, two
important either features,

343
00:24:42,951 --> 00:24:47,951
additional features of this workmanship
ideal that I'm just going to mention now

344
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:50,360
and then I'll come back to um,

345
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:55,660
one is that a translates over also
into normative considerations.

346
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:02,160
That is to say not only does
God have worked medicines,

347
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,560
Workman's knowledge creators
knowledge of what he creates,

348
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,620
but he also owns what he creates.

349
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,200
He has rights over his creation.

350
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:16,670
We are God's property
because he created us.

351
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,870
The world is God's property.
The Universe is God's property.

352
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:24,320
You own what you make.
God made everything.

353
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:26,930
So ultimately God owns everything.

354
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,440
And just as we can behave as miniature
gods and understanding our creation,

355
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:38,770
we can also behave as miniature
gods in owning what we make.

356
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:44,210
So we will see later this affects his
theory of property and his theory of the

357
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:47,960
state because we are going to have
rights over the state, which we create.

358
00:25:47,961 --> 00:25:52,790
We're going to get to all of that later.
Okay. But so it's a unified theory,

359
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:57,791
this workmanship ideal that goes both
to the question of knowledge and to the

360
00:25:58,161 --> 00:26:02,540
question of ownership rights,
entitlements,

361
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,290
everything is traced back
to this workmanship ideal.

362
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:10,810
The second point that I'm just
going to mention now and will,

363
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,920
it will come up later,
uh, it'll come up, uh,

364
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:19,340
most dramatically when we
come to consider marks.

365
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:25,160
Is that what gave lock it's theory,

366
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,010
it's internal coherence,

367
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,800
was that it was a theological argument.

368
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:36,340
None of this really makes any sense unless
you start from this proposition that

369
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:42,730
God created the universe and has make us
knowledge and make us a authority over

370
00:26:42,891 --> 00:26:47,430
the universe. You know, everything
flows from that. As I said, uh, in,

371
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,270
in locks understanding, he gave us, um,

372
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:52,680
okay,

373
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,450
this unique capacity to create as well.
Um,

374
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,630
but we are answerable to him in
ways that that'll come up later.

375
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,200
But none of this makes sense without
the theological assumptions behind it.

376
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,410
Okay.

377
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:11,380
One of the big projects
of the enlightenment,

378
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:16,530
which is going to concern us one way or
another throughout the course is what

379
00:27:17,231 --> 00:27:21,670
happens if you try to secularize
the workmanship ideal.

380
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:26,380
That is to say, you'll see in
the labor theory of value, uh,

381
00:27:26,381 --> 00:27:27,970
that Mark's embraces,

382
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
which is at the core of his political
theory and modern social contract

383
00:27:33,011 --> 00:27:36,700
theorists like Nozick and
Rawls and many others.

384
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:42,160
What what you're going to find is that
people want to hold onto this basic

385
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:47,860
structure of thinking.
People find this workmanship ideal,

386
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,900
intuitively very appealing,

387
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:56,940
but they're going to try and detach it
from its theological moorings because,

388
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,060
uh,
they,

389
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:02,440
they either don't believe the theological
argument for one reason or another,

390
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:07,330
or they find it problematic or
they wanted to convince people

391
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:13,840
that this idea that making creates
ownership is powerful and important

392
00:28:13,841 --> 00:28:16,210
regardless of your religious convictions.

393
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:21,510
And so one of the big
challenges and projects of the
enlightenment is gonna turn

394
00:28:21,641 --> 00:28:24,370
out to be how,
if at all,

395
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:29,520
can we retain the structure of this
workmanship ideal while shedding?

396
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,400
It's in its theological foundations,

397
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:36,430
but that's getting ahead of ourselves.

398
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,800
So what I want the takeaway point for,

399
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:44,830
for today to be is that this is the early
enlightenment conception of science.

400
00:28:44,861 --> 00:28:49,861
It's a workmanship ideal
that appeals to certainty,

401
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,740
which was the Cartesian,
um,

402
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,620
preoccupation in the
Hobbs and preoccupation.

403
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,020
But it does it in a different way.

404
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,790
It doesn't look for what we today think
of as analytic propositions. Rather,

405
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:08,791
it looks for propositions that can be
known with certainty because we introspect

406
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:15,390
into our own will and understand
with certainty what we have created.

407
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,953
Okay?

408
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,480
And now let's,

409
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:27,620
yeah,

410
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:31,430
start to transition to talking
about individual rights.

411
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:40,100
And we do this by moving from God's
knowledge of his creation to God's

412
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:44,410
ownership, his creation. Just
to sum up this work on ship.

413
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:49,180
Ideal Locke
says,

414
00:29:49,181 --> 00:29:52,540
the state of nature has a
law of nature to governance,

415
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:56,530
which obliges everyone and reason
which is that Lord teachers,

416
00:29:56,531 --> 00:30:01,300
all mankind who will buck consulted,
that being all equal and independent,

417
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:04,650
no one ought to harm went out of his
life, health, liberty, and possessions.

418
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,800
I'll come back to that.

419
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:11,670
For men being all the workmanship of one
omnipotent and infinitely wise makeup,

420
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:17,380
all the servants of one sovereign Ma
Mazda sent into the world by his order and

421
00:30:17,381 --> 00:30:18,460
about his business.

422
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:23,730
They are his property whose workmanship
they are made to last during his,

423
00:30:23,951 --> 00:30:27,940
not during one another's pleasure.
And being furnished with faculties,

424
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:32,860
sharing all in one community of nature
that cannot be supposed any such

425
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:37,861
subordination among us that may authorize
us to destroy one another as we were

426
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:41,170
made for one another,
as if we were made for one.

427
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:46,171
And we're now this uses as the inferior
ranks and creatures are four hours.

428
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,393
So

429
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:58,860
this idea should give
you a sense in which, um,

430
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:04,380
Locke's theory of individual
rights are basic, uh,

431
00:31:04,381 --> 00:31:07,260
and are rooted in the workmanship ideal.

432
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:14,030
We are God's creations. We are
his property. And that means,

433
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,800
you know,
as he says here,

434
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:20,180
we can't be one and now this
property we can own one another.

435
00:31:20,181 --> 00:31:24,980
You might or you might say, well,
well don't parents make that children

436
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,760
don't parents own their children?

437
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:33,761
And indeed Sir Robert filmer that Locke
who lock was arguing against in the

438
00:31:33,981 --> 00:31:38,720
first treaties took exactly the view
that parents own their children.

439
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,200
But film I had a very different conception
of the theological foundations of the

440
00:31:46,161 --> 00:31:50,510
universe. Velma, who was
a defender of absolutism.

441
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,033
Um,

442
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:57,430
Elma said God gave the world to
Adam and his ass through a system of

443
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,690
primogenitor or inheritance.

444
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:04,850
And so there were a lot of folks running
around in 17th century England for

445
00:32:04,851 --> 00:32:09,140
example, say Yang. Well,
I can, if you pay me,

446
00:32:09,141 --> 00:32:13,400
I can prove that you're a closer
descendant of Adam than the next guy.

447
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,790
This was the notion that,
uh,

448
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:20,980
the lineage to Adam was important and
indeed that the kings and Queens of Europe

449
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:25,830
got their political authority
because they were direct descendants,

450
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:30,350
the most direct living descendants
of Adam and eve. So it was,

451
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:35,210
it was this idea God gave the world, uh,
to add him to, and he, to his children,

452
00:32:35,211 --> 00:32:38,720
children, children, and in
absolute is thought there was,

453
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,420
they very seriously the idea that,

454
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,670
that pet parents own their children
and can indeed solve them into slavery,

455
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,530
uh, or worse, uh, because that
their property, Locke says, no,

456
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:57,100
God makes the child and users
the parents as his instrument.

457
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,260
The parents simply act out an
urge that's implanted in them,

458
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:07,400
but they can't a fashion the
anchor intricacies of the child.

459
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:10,790
And of course they can't
put a soul in the child.

460
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:16,040
So the child is God's creation
and we are all God's creation,

461
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,050
uh,
unlike

462
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,810
the view developed by filmer.

463
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,520
And so when we think about the
doctrine of individual rights,

464
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,953
um,

465
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:34,260
the first thing to see is that this
workmanship idea gives us at fundamental a

466
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:41,220
different status than anything that
it existed before in Weston political

467
00:33:42,131 --> 00:33:45,310
thinking.
Because we are created by God,

468
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:47,650
we're all equal in the sight of God,

469
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:52,900
and we have the capacity to
function as miniature gods, um,

470
00:33:52,901 --> 00:33:56,500
because of this capacity to
create things that we have.

471
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,380
Right?
Secondly,

472
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:05,010
we're all equal before God.

473
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,640
We're equal as he says here,

474
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,320
where do we consider natural reason?

475
00:34:13,321 --> 00:34:17,250
Which tells us that men being once born
have a right to their preservation and

476
00:34:17,251 --> 00:34:21,030
consequently to meet and drink and other
such things as nature affords their

477
00:34:21,031 --> 00:34:23,220
subsistence or revelation,

478
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:28,440
which gives us an account of those gods
grants God made of the world to Adam and

479
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:33,030
Noah and his sons. It is very
clear that God, as King David said,

480
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:33,991
has given the,

481
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:38,991
are to the children of men
giving it to mankind in common.

482
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:45,090
So we are all equally created by God.

483
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:50,150
We all have the same rights to the common
as everybody else and there's no sense

484
00:34:51,271 --> 00:34:55,620
in which it's Adam and his ass that have

485
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:04,050
it's, there's no sense that that Adam
and his as have some kind of priority.

486
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,053
Thirdly,

487
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:19,440
it's very important for lock and a very
radical move to say that there is no or

488
00:35:25,031 --> 00:35:28,780
authoritative earthly
interpreter of the scriptures.

489
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:34,650
Anyone guess why might say that?
You know,

490
00:35:34,651 --> 00:35:38,520
there, there may be ambiguities
in the scriptures mean

491
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,073
mmm.

492
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:48,890
And one person says it means x and one
person sees it, says it means why. Okay,

493
00:35:48,891 --> 00:35:51,260
we have a volunteer over there.
Why,

494
00:35:51,261 --> 00:35:56,240
why is it important for lock to say
that nobody on earth can settle those

495
00:35:56,241 --> 00:35:57,230
disagreements?

496
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:04,580
Because that person would supposedly
leave be closer to God. Um,

497
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,780
being an interpreter of the word of God,

498
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:11,740
right. That person would set themselves
up as being closer to the word of God,

499
00:36:11,741 --> 00:36:13,150
being the interpretive that God,

500
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:18,450
the word of God every man ought to salient
acquiring into himself by meditation

501
00:36:18,671 --> 00:36:20,920
studies,
search and his own endeavors,

502
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,970
attain the knowledge of cannot
be looked upon as a peculiar,

503
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:26,801
I'm sorry,

504
00:36:26,801 --> 00:36:31,720
I'm mystery every man or sincerely to
inquire into himself and by meditation

505
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,600
studies search and his own endeavors,

506
00:36:34,601 --> 00:36:39,601
attain knowledge of cannot be looked upon
as the peculiar possession of any sort

507
00:36:40,451 --> 00:36:44,860
of man. I think, uh, say a word
has been dropped there, but the,

508
00:36:44,861 --> 00:36:49,861
the meaning of it is that authoritative
knowledge can't be the peculiar,

509
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:53,320
uh, interpret, uh, possession
of any particular person.

510
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:57,190
Princes indeed are
superior to men in power.

511
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,080
But in nature equal,

512
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:04,090
neither the right nor the art of ruling
does necessarily calorie along with it.

513
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,650
The creation of knowledge about other
things and least of all of true religion

514
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,031
for if it were.

515
00:37:10,031 --> 00:37:15,010
So how could it come to pass that the
lords of the earth should differ so vastly

516
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:18,100
as they do in religious matters?

517
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:23,490
So political leaders differ with
one another about religious matters.

518
00:37:24,311 --> 00:37:27,910
And that itself tells
you that you can't know.

519
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:33,510
You can't rely on anybody to saddle
them because nobody has more privileged

520
00:37:34,721 --> 00:37:36,820
access than anybody else

521
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:42,540
to God's knowledge.
So it's,

522
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:47,030
it's the beginning of what we will lay
to come to refer to as a Lutheran idea of

523
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:49,460
the relationship between man and God.

524
00:37:49,461 --> 00:37:54,461
But the idea is that everyone misread
the scriptures for themselves.

525
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,630
And if God wants to speak to you,

526
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:01,520
he will speak through the scriptures.

527
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,610
And if somebody else
reads them differently,

528
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:07,820
nobody on earth can
settle that disagreement.

529
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,270
Nobody has the right to
settle that disagreement.

530
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,200
Everybody must settle it for themselves.

531
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,280
And that's going to turn out to be
hugely important in politics because if

532
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:27,610
people start to believe that the ruler
of this society is violating natural law,

533
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,970
there's nobody who can say they
don't have the right to hold that.

534
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:41,730
What it means they can do in practice is
another matter that we'll get to later.

535
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:47,700
So it's going to provide the basis for
the right to resist the authority of the

536
00:38:47,711 --> 00:38:52,700
state, the right to resist sovereign
authority. When we thinking,

537
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,940
think about the Eichmann problem again,

538
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,090
when you are ordered to do something,

539
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:03,120
just send people to a concentration camp
and your read the scriptures and you

540
00:39:03,161 --> 00:39:07,180
say, well, my reading of the
Bible tells me that this is wrong.

541
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:12,430
There is no earthly authority.
Who has the right to contradict you?

542
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:18,420
Tremendously important philosophical
move with huge political consequences.

543
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:26,550
Of course, there was another
consideration here, um, who not while,

544
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,230
who knows,
uh,

545
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:32,190
it was not just the disagreements
among the kings and Queens of Europe,

546
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,140
but who else might lock of being
thinking about in the 16, uh, eighties,

547
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,730
uh, not wanting to give authority
to, we're interpreting the scripture,

548
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:46,830
some history major.
What was going on in England in the 60s,

549
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,650
70s and 80s.
Anybody now

550
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,490
who were they worried about?

551
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:57,120
Not just the different kings
competing and the authorities? Yeah,

552
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:03,120
the pope. Yeah. Okay. We don't
need the mic. The pub of course.

553
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:04,523
Uh,

554
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:11,960
you will see when you come to read
Locke's letter on toleration, uh, that,

555
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,950
that he has a very wide
view of toleration,

556
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:21,080
but he doesn't think that Catholics should
be tolerated. We'll get to why later.

557
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,820
Uh,

558
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:27,820
but the reason here would be that the
pope sets himself up as the authoritative

559
00:40:28,611 --> 00:40:32,690
interpreter of the scripture
and you can't have that. Okay.

560
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:36,620
You have to have something like what
we would call today at this established

561
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,513
church.

562
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:43,120
And indeed that takes us to a fourth
source of individual rights in locks

563
00:40:44,481 --> 00:40:48,110
thinking namely that every
individual is sovereign.

564
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:56,090
The care of Saul's cannot belong to
the civil magistrate because his power

565
00:40:56,091 --> 00:40:59,180
consists only in outward force,

566
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:04,760
but true and saving religion consists
in the end with persuasion of the mind

567
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:08,270
without which nothing
can be acceptable to God.

568
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:13,310
And such is the nature of
the understanding that it
cannot be compelled to the

569
00:41:13,311 --> 00:41:18,110
belief of anything by outward force.
And upon this ground,

570
00:41:18,111 --> 00:41:23,111
I affirmed that the magistrates power
extends not to establishing of any

571
00:41:23,271 --> 00:41:28,271
articles of faith or forms of
worship by the force of his laws,

572
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:34,240
for laws are have no force at all
without penalties and penalties.

573
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:35,540
In,
in this case,

574
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:40,541
I absolutely impertinent because they
are not proper to convince the mind.

575
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:46,070
The state can control your behavior,
but it can make you believe anything.

576
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:52,760
And this is the source
of his objection to any,

577
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:58,510
any earthly authority being
in the position to dictate
what religion requires,

578
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:04,910
whether it's the king or the pub,
right?

579
00:42:04,911 --> 00:42:09,911
There is no authoritative interpretation
of the scriptures in this world.

580
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:16,280
Tremendously important move.
So just to summarize,

581
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:25,480
we have this workmanship idea that informs
the early enlightenment conception of

582
00:42:25,481 --> 00:42:30,220
science.
It's preoccupied with certainty and um,

583
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:35,340
it's rooted in this creationist theory
of knowledge that we have workmanship,

584
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:40,990
Workman's knowledge of,
of our workmanship. Uh,

585
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:45,520
it also translates over into the
theory of rights because justice,

586
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,430
we have workman's just
knowledge about creation.

587
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:52,180
We also have a workman's
authority over his creation.

588
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,350
We own what we make just
as we know what we make.

589
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,880
Secondly, where we, we own

590
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:08,990
the right to the worlds, what he's
going to lay to call the waste of God,

591
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:14,530
what's given to mankind in common just
as little or as much as everybody else.

592
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,390
There is nobody who has a prior claim on

593
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:25,220
the property out there,
the animals,

594
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:30,320
the land,
everything that's in God's creation.

595
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:35,530
We all have the right to use it and
nobody has the right to stop anybody else

596
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,860
from using it, right? We didn't
make it so we don't own it.

597
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:42,860
God made it and he gave
it to us in common.

598
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:47,430
This is in contradiction of film,

599
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,440
his view that he gave it
to Adam and Adam's as I've
inherited both the goods and

600
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:59,051
property in the world and the political
authority in the world directly from

601
00:43:59,361 --> 00:44:02,830
Adam.
So it's this basic idea that um,

602
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:08,110
we have common rights to the
creation that God has put before us.

603
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:16,050
Third,
we have equal access to the word of God.

604
00:44:16,051 --> 00:44:21,051
And that's really important because
the word of God or natural law is

605
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:29,020
what binds all human beings.
We're all his creation and natural law.

606
00:44:29,021 --> 00:44:32,250
His expression of his,
well, we have to obey it.

607
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:36,740
But what if we don't agree

608
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,260
about what it means? What if we
don't agree about what it means?

609
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:45,330
That's what the second treaties is about.

610
00:44:45,331 --> 00:44:48,830
We're going to talk about
that in a few weeks, right?

611
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,200
But the important point here
is the sovereign doesn't
have any right to declare

612
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,290
what natural law mean.

613
00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:02,310
So the magistrate to compel us to
believe the received interpretation.

614
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,493
Um,

615
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:09,860
and finally each individual is sovereign
over himself because true and saving

616
00:45:11,581 --> 00:45:15,300
religion as he puts it consists
of inward persuasion of the mind.

617
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:20,630
You can't be made to believe things
and it's your authentic belief that

618
00:45:21,361 --> 00:45:23,250
something is the right answer,

619
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:26,700
which is essential to its
being the right answer.

620
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:32,150
And this is going to supply the basis
for the right to resist the right to

621
00:45:32,791 --> 00:45:34,860
resist the authority of the state.

622
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:38,910
That is ultimately,
uh,

623
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:44,010
the right on which locks
political theory is constructed.

624
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,830
So this workmanship ideal
informs the theory of knowledge.

625
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:54,600
And the theory of rights, and we are
going to see that it doesn't go away.

626
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,400
People try to secularize it and we're
going to explore the ways in which that

627
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,790
they do that. Um, if considerable lang,

628
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:07,950
but um,
they try to modify it as well,

629
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:09,450
but it doesn't go away.

630
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:14,480
And you'll see that one of the reasons
it doesn't go away is that problematic as

631
00:46:15,361 --> 00:46:18,300
it might be. And it, and there
are many problems with it.

632
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,550
Very few people,

633
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:26,390
very few people in this room I will bet
are going to ever want to give it up in

634
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,430
Kylie.
Okay.

635
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:34,560
So we'll start knocking next Wednesday
with classical utilitarianism,

636
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:37,620
the first of our enlightenment traditions.
See you then.
