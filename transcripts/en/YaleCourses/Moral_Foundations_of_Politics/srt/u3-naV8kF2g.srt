1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,830
Okay.
So let's begin.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,900
I asked you to,

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,000
to bear two questions in
mind in reading the Eichmann.

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,043
MMM.

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,850
And I'm going to get to those in a minute,
but before we get to that,

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,490
who, who was ad off? Eichmann

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:24,840
okay.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,920
Who was that? Oh, fuck man.

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,283
Wow.

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,720
You're going to have to
get, get a, a microphone.

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:33,643
Okay.

12
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:45,190
He was the expert on Jewish
immigration and relocation,

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,230
but why was his job, what was he, what
was his Chinese, what was he there to do?

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,750
Um Hm.

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,171
Well,

16
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:57,171
in the beginning he was sent to talk
to the Jewish elder council and try to

17
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:59,430
negotiate,
um,

18
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,480
the moving of thousands of Jewish people
as quickly as possible from different

19
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:03,950
areas

20
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:07,490
throughout Europe. Correct.
What else was he supposed to do?

21
00:01:07,491 --> 00:01:09,920
Why don't you give somebody
else a chance that,

22
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:13,340
that was certainly part of what he was
doing. What else was he supposed to do?

23
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,650
What's he,
was he somebody,

24
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,800
was he somebody who was involved in
designing the final solution as it was

25
00:01:25,581 --> 00:01:29,370
called in? The third way
was, was he a policymaker?

26
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,850
April is shaking their heads. No, he
wasn't. He was basically an implementer,

27
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,290
right?
He was,

28
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,680
he was obeying orders and his job
was to make the trains run on time,

29
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,290
literally speaking their
trains that were going to, um,

30
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:53,110
take Jews to concentration camps or was
it complicated logistical feat and he

31
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:58,660
was in charge of it. His
job was to make sure, uh,

32
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,840
that it was an efficiently run operation.
Um,

33
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:07,940
as I said at the end of the war, he was
actually captured by the allied forces,

34
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:11,990
but they didn't realize what
a significant figure he was.

35
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,690
He was subsequently released,

36
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:19,691
inadvertently made his way to Latin
America where he lived on the cover until

37
00:02:20,511 --> 00:02:24,680
the Mossad found out where he was.
And then in 1960,

38
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,240
they kidnapped him,

39
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,470
brought him to Israel where he was tried.

40
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,090
In the trial that you read about
in this book, uh, for debt today,

41
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,290
found guilty of crimes are grants to
the Jewish people and crimes against

42
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,450
humanity and put to death.

43
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,633
MMM,

44
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,890
okay.
What kind of a person was he?

45
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,330
What do you think motivated him
when you read, you read this,

46
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:59,260
what kind of a person? What's,
what stood out about him? Anybody?

47
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,120
Okay.

48
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,650
It seemed throughout the,
uh,

49
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,040
throughout the text that he was driven
by this idea of self advancement.

50
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,390
The need for,
uh,

51
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,330
he wanted to, he wanted
to get ahead. Yeah.

52
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:20,080
He wanted to impress his superiors.
Yeah. First and foremost,

53
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:24,280
I believe he wanted to get
an a right. Pretty much, yes.

54
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,250
What he was that, that's one thing
that strikes you about him. Yeah.

55
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:28,480
What else struck you about him?

56
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,470
Uh, the thoughtlessness that
he demonstrated throughout
the camp. They what? Sorry.

57
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:38,130
Thoughtlessness just kind of the
blind obedience to the first word.

58
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:41,200
If he wants to be moist, not
our reflective man. Not at all.

59
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,560
It's not somebody who would
question authority. Right.

60
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,270
Did you get the impression
he hated Jews? No. No.

61
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,010
What makes you say that?

62
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:56,540
Uh, I mean, full first during
his testimony, he claimed
that he didn't hate Jews.

63
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:01,170
Uh, he actually was a supporter of
the Zionist movement, uh, through the,

64
00:04:01,171 --> 00:04:05,030
some of the readings that
he did before 1939. And,

65
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,850
uh,
throughout even the years between 1939,

66
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:11,451
1945,

67
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,570
when he was carrying out all these actions
that were detrimental to the Jewish

68
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:19,400
people, he found himself
having Jewish friends,

69
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:21,590
working with the Jewish people,
trying to find solutions.

70
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:26,120
But as long as that didn't contradict
the orders of his superiors,

71
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,280
I think you've got him exactly right.

72
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,470
He's not somebody who was not somebody
motivated by a restoral antisemitism.

73
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,080
Indeed. You get the impression
reading this book that if,

74
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,890
if his superiors had said to him,

75
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,870
instead of shipping people to
concentration camps, we want you to ship,

76
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,900
um, munitions around the third
way to resupply the army.

77
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,410
All we want you to ship, um, car parts.

78
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,410
He would have done it with the same,
um,

79
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,820
zeal and desire to improve his,
uh,

80
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,710
standing with his superiors. He wouldn't
have been any different about it.

81
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:12,170
Um, he didn't seem to
be like a, somebody who,

82
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,310
who saw this as a great opportunity
to do something he really believed in.

83
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:20,780
He was simply trying to
get an a China get ahead,

84
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:23,000
trying to impress his superiors,

85
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:27,740
do it good and efficient job at
whatever it was that he was asked to do.

86
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,893
Um,

87
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,720
is that if that, if that's an
accurate description about him,

88
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:39,370
it's quite chilling.
Right.

89
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,600
And I think this brings
us to the first question.

90
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,080
What is it that makes you
uncomfortable about this

91
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,513
man?

92
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,870
One of the things I
asked you to think about,

93
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:58,550
what makes you uncomfortable
about Eichmann?

94
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,783
Yeah.

95
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,770
The fact that he was just, um, basically
not thinking about what he was doing.

96
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,800
So someone else had total control
of what he was going to do.

97
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,600
So he has his own reflectiveness
is what makes you uncomfortable.

98
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,950
Right. Cause that means really
anyone can be like that.

99
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,850
It kind of makes you reflect on
yourself and not just on human nature.

100
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,540
Okay. So you, you feel he should
have been questioning the, the, uh,

101
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,790
the authorities that were giving him the
orders to do this? Yeah, that'd be nice.

102
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:37,350
Okay. That's definitely one thing that
makes people uncomfortable. What else?

103
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,770
Anybody else?

104
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,373
Yeah.

105
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,760
Um, it was just that his on reflectiveness
transferred to the fact that,

106
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,330
uh, well, you know, he
wanted to do his job well,

107
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,020
but the fact was that he wasn't
just transporting munitions.

108
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,660
These were people's lives.
Uh,

109
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,780
supposedly people he easily
could have been friends with.

110
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,100
Right. He Wa he wasn't thinking about
the larger purpose. Um, so it's,

111
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,560
it's connected to the on reflectiveness,

112
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:20,830
although we'll see that one of the themes
in this course that political theorist

113
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:26,291
write about is the whole idea of detaching
means from ends of thinking about how

114
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:32,570
to do things efficiently without
reference to what it is that we are doing.

115
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,760
But it makes us uncomfortable. What else
makes you uncomfortable about this man?

116
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:44,040
What makes you, what makes your
skin crawl when you think about him?

117
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:51,460
Anything else? Yeah,
let's get the microphone.

118
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,900
He was gloating like when he was in
Argentina and he was doing his interviews,

119
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:02,860
he was gloating about the millions of
people that had died because of him,

120
00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:03,694
because of his work.

121
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,900
He was pleased that he
had done a good job. Yeah.

122
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:10,470
It wasn't as if he was doing this
with any sense of reluctance. Right.

123
00:08:10,471 --> 00:08:12,540
He was doing it with even,

124
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:16,950
even though you don't get the sense that
this man had a visceral antisemitism

125
00:08:16,951 --> 00:08:17,784
about him,

126
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,870
he certainly was pleased with the fact
that his superiors like what he was doing

127
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,480
and that,
uh,

128
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:28,290
he was being commended for it and he was,
um,

129
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,900
uh,
getting ahead.

130
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,000
Anything, anything else that
makes you uncomfortable about him?

131
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,283
Yeah,

132
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,620
he brings up the term
idealist and he sort of, um,

133
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,950
attaches a sense of honor and loyalty
to the Third Reich that we find

134
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:56,460
uncomfortable

135
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,360
because of what it's trying to call to,

136
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:03,590
to his superiors that he thought it
was important to a by his superiors.

137
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,410
Okay. Uh, anybody at somebody over there?

138
00:09:09,411 --> 00:09:10,820
I was going to say, yeah, over there.

139
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,940
Um, well it's not something
specific about his actions,

140
00:09:15,941 --> 00:09:17,950
but I'm uncomfortable
with the fact that one,

141
00:09:17,951 --> 00:09:21,130
he is constantly normal by
all the tests. And two, he,

142
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,040
when he wasn't thinking at
all, he actually saw, he was
thinking and he filled it.

143
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,500
All the people when you get into
thinking that he's smart and competent,

144
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,920
so it makes you wonder if that's
the stupidity is just something,

145
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:30,754
was he all of us?

146
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,920
Yup.
I think that's right as well.

147
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:39,130
So here you have a man who is completely
unreflective about what he's doing.

148
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,770
He's a bang orders from above.

149
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:48,250
He's not breaking the law right at
all into implementing the law as it,

150
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,390
as it's enacted in the Third Reich.

151
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,080
And he's going about something that is
absolutely monstrous with calm efficiency

152
00:09:58,551 --> 00:10:02,730
and good humor, uh, and going home. Uh,

153
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,530
you could imagine this guy going home
at the end of the week playing with

154
00:10:06,531 --> 00:10:09,470
children, uh, being
friends with the neighbors,

155
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:13,760
going to a barbecue and going back to
work the next day. All right. It's, uh,

156
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,570
one of our ranch raises to capture this.

157
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,250
Is that one of the things that seems so
chilling about this guys that he doesn't

158
00:10:22,251 --> 00:10:27,250
seem like a monster.
He seems like the man next door and the,

159
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:32,120
and this, the phrase she uses is the
banality of evil. He doesn't seem like,

160
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,950
uh,
um,

161
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:35,750
okay.

162
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,330
Somebody who's got some,
uh,

163
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,710
unusual trait. So it, I think, you know,

164
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,250
to push to turn the screw
a little bit further,

165
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:51,730
one of the things that makes people
uncomfortable with a man like this is sort

166
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:57,320
of makes you wonder how would you
have behaved in his situation?

167
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:04,250
You know, you hope you would
have not behaved as he did,

168
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:08,570
but he doesn't seem that unusual.
He seems completely unremarkable,

169
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,640
man. Fairly typical a
guy, uh, doing what he's,

170
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,410
you know, putting one foot in
front of the other, in, in,

171
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:22,220
in the situation in which he finds
himself and getting on with his life.

172
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:26,150
Um, and that I think is
captured by her phrase,

173
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,980
the banality of evil. Um, okay.

174
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,040
Let's now just put Eifman to one side
for a minute and think about the second

175
00:11:37,821 --> 00:11:41,870
question I asked you to reflect
upon while reading this.

176
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:47,260
What two things make you most
uncomfortable about around,

177
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:52,070
about the events surrounding Eichmann's
apprehension, trial and execution.

178
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,410
First of all, this, why
did Israel do what it did?

179
00:11:57,411 --> 00:11:59,660
Why do you think they
went and came dot him?

180
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,420
Okay.

181
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,720
Mean the normal process,
you know, if, if you,

182
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,030
mmm.

183
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,460
If you're trying to get hold of a
criminal and in other countries you,

184
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,330
you go and you apply for
extradition and he'd come the,

185
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,220
you make the case and you go to court
and the person is arrested and, and uh,

186
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:24,220
eventually they brought
that brought to trial.

187
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,853
MMM.

188
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,180
So why didn't they do that?
Why did they do what they did?

189
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:33,440
Anybody either no one to take a guess.
Why did they do that?

190
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,090
Anyone want to try that?
Yeah.

191
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:43,840
Well,

192
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,790
it seems to imply that they might have
been concerned or might've suspected

193
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,430
other countries wouldn't be sympathetic
to their wish to try it. Okay.

194
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,020
They might have worried that he'd
Garner a certain amount of international

195
00:12:58,021 --> 00:12:59,730
support or,
or defense,

196
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,050
sorry, I'm sorry guys living
in. I think that's right.

197
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:06,260
If they tried to extradite him, it,
it wouldn't have worked as soon as he,

198
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:11,261
he knew there were many other former
Nazis in Argentina and elsewhere in Latin

199
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:14,650
America. Uh, the minute
he realized that they,

200
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:17,440
they knew where he was and who he was,

201
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,330
he would have gone on to
ground and vanished. And, uh,

202
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,090
they would have been so much sand in
the we all stuff the extradition system

203
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,790
that uh,
they made a judgment,

204
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:32,680
which is probably a valid judgment that
if they were going to get them at all,

205
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:34,090
this was the way they
were going to get him.

206
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,623
MMM.

207
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,940
So that's why they did it pretty much.
That's why they did it.

208
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:41,883
MMM.

209
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:46,940
Okay. So given that, that's
why they did it, what,

210
00:13:46,941 --> 00:13:50,510
if anything makes you uncomfortable
about what, what they did

211
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,660
over here?
We need to mine.

212
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,623
Yeah.

213
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,870
In one of the last two chapters,

214
00:14:02,871 --> 00:14:06,990
I believe they're discussing the reasons
for judgment against him in on all the

215
00:14:06,991 --> 00:14:09,250
accounts.
And one of them will,

216
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,310
she's discussing the four main points
that they attempt to prove through the

217
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:17,600
prosecution and Indian in some of them
they discuss the term in Doobie au

218
00:14:17,601 --> 00:14:22,010
contraire rule on, which is I guess
when in doubt act against the defendant.

219
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:27,050
And that was kind of just when we don't
have necessarily all of the evidence

220
00:14:27,051 --> 00:14:30,770
because a lot of it is speculative,
we will act in a way that will,

221
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,640
okay. So there, there was not a lot
of attention to the rules of evidence.

222
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:41,550
Yeah. Right. Okay. So that's one thing
that there were a lot of what it,

223
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:46,240
what we would think of as procedural
irregularities and this trial.

224
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:47,710
Uh,
yeah.

225
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,200
Yeah.

226
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,820
I was uncomfortable with the speed
of the execution. It happened, uh,

227
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:59,390
extremely soon after his appeal and
plea for mercy within a couple hours.

228
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,870
Right. He was, it was, it was the way
expectations at done in China today,

229
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,490
not the way executions at done in the
United States today. Right. He was,

230
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,480
it was very rapid. And why, why
were you uncomfortable with that?

231
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:19,540
I think there's no doubt that what he did
was wrong, but you at least have to, uh,

232
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,600
go through the procedures just to ensure
that justice is actually served so that

233
00:15:25,061 --> 00:15:27,640
even if it was correct that
they should have, you know,

234
00:15:27,641 --> 00:15:31,060
that he deserved the death
penalty. Um, I think the actual,

235
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,850
the protocol should have
been followed in that, um,

236
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,750
he should have gotten his time
to make the appeal and, uh,

237
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,380
okay.
Anything else?

238
00:15:40,381 --> 00:15:44,010
Make anybody uncomfortable about
what was done over. Yeah. Yeah.

239
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,120
Um, it mentioned in the beginning
how shall we, the trial was, and, um,

240
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,450
one part that I thought really stuck with
me was when the author mentioned that,

241
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,450
uh, Israel, Israel's
laws itself prohibitive.

242
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,830
Josh is Israeli law prohibited
Jewish and non Jewish marriage.

243
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:08,420
So how the two societies, although
one is certainly worse than the other,

244
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:11,300
I think on a moral level there's
still no perfect society.

245
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:13,610
And that really kind of
was disturbing I think.

246
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:17,750
Okay. So it was something of
a show trial. Yeah, it was,

247
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,910
there was more than one
agenda here I want agenda was,

248
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:27,710
uh, justice bringing him to justice,
but clearly there was an agenda,

249
00:16:27,711 --> 00:16:32,711
revenge and there was an agenda
of catharsis for many of the,

250
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,150
the,
um,

251
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,370
people who testified who came there,

252
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:42,380
it was very important for them personally
to get up and speak about what had

253
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:45,710
happened to them for which
he was held responsible.

254
00:16:45,711 --> 00:16:48,260
So there were multiple
agendas going on here,

255
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,800
only one of which was what
we normally think office,

256
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:56,180
what's going on in a criminal prosecution.
Anything else?

257
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,430
Make anybody uncomfortable?
Yeah. Over here.

258
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,840
Um, the author had mentioned that Israel
wouldn't have gone to the trouble of

259
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,710
kidnapping him if he wasn't
automatically going to be found guilty.

260
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,860
Like they weren't, it was just a
foregone conclusion from the beginning.

261
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:16,260
And that's just really sending
such a bad precedent for, you know,

262
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,460
trials in general. Um, so even
though it was clear he was guilty,

263
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:21,840
the fact that it was just,
you know,

264
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,500
they wouldn't have even trouble troubled
going through it if they thought there

265
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,260
was any possibility of
him being found innocent.

266
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:32,180
Oh, nice. So it was, it was, uh, the
outcome was never in doubt. Hmm. Okay.

267
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,610
And that makes you nervous because,
hang on.

268
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,853
Okay.

269
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,960
Um, because while his cases
is pretty black and white,

270
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:43,700
that's just setting a precedent
for the future. And if,

271
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,550
if in a case where it's so clearly,
um, he's so clearly guilty,

272
00:17:47,551 --> 00:17:51,390
you can't use real evidence and you can't
actually go through the steps with a

273
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:54,540
meaningful steps of a trial to
find him guilty, then it's hard.

274
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,130
Then it seems like in the future,

275
00:17:56,131 --> 00:18:01,020
other trials where it's not a black and
white maybe made more into show trials

276
00:18:01,021 --> 00:18:01,854
as well.

277
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,970
Like if he could clearly have been found
guilty in a meaningful way with real

278
00:18:05,971 --> 00:18:09,510
evidence and they just kind
of didn't try to do that.

279
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:15,040
Okay. Anything else? Make anyone
uncomfortable? Yeah. Over here

280
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:22,500
also the lack of evidence
that was eligible for
procurement on this side of the

281
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:26,820
defense and the lack of defense
support really stuck out to me.

282
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,680
It didn't have what we call discovery.

283
00:18:29,681 --> 00:18:33,130
There was a lot of procedural
irregularities here.

284
00:18:33,131 --> 00:18:37,450
They didn't have access to the
evidence, uh, and they, they could make,

285
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,350
there were a lot of what, you know,
when you all go off to the Lord,

286
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,720
the Lord is calling you
learn criminal procedure.

287
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:48,580
A few years from now there was a lot of
what would be called reversible error in

288
00:18:48,581 --> 00:18:53,170
this trial that is on an on appeal
would have run into trouble procedural

289
00:18:53,171 --> 00:18:56,890
problems. And so there were procedural
problems in the trial. What else?

290
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,930
Over there?
Yeah.

291
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:07,170
Um, it makes me uncomfortable that Israel
was even claiming jurisdiction in the

292
00:19:07,171 --> 00:19:07,740
case.

293
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,740
Considering the crime did not happen on
Israeli soil and that they literally had

294
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:17,760
to send their secret service to kidnap
him to bring him to Israeli soil.

295
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,120
Okay.
So you're,

296
00:19:19,121 --> 00:19:23,810
you are travel that they thought
they had jurisdiction in this matter,

297
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:28,340
right, because the crime
didn't happen on Israeli soil.

298
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:33,050
Any other reason why one might be
troubled that they claimed jurisdiction?

299
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:34,540
Um,

300
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:39,130
it felt like it was the country
kind of speaking for, uh,

301
00:19:39,131 --> 00:19:43,870
people are speaking for humanity in
a way that was just unsettling to me.

302
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:45,990
Okay.

303
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:50,700
Did they arrogated to themselves the
right to prosecute in the name of the

304
00:19:50,701 --> 00:19:54,450
Jewish people and in the name of humanity,
crimes against humanity,

305
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:58,050
they convicted him, uh, of you might say,

306
00:19:58,051 --> 00:20:02,640
who appointed them to do
that? Uh, I think, uh,

307
00:20:02,641 --> 00:20:07,080
there's a lot of, uh, a lot of truth
to what you say there, but this,

308
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:10,230
there are a number of other
aspects to it as well.

309
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,420
Why else might we be troubled that they
thought they had jurisdiction to do this?

310
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,900
What does jurisdiction mean anyway?
What does jurisdiction?

311
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,183
Yeah.

312
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,170
Um, I think it's equally troubling that
they thought that they had to do this.

313
00:20:32,171 --> 00:20:35,710
I mean they talked a lot about the way
that former Nazis are being tried in

314
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:38,320
Germany and how lenient
their punishments were.

315
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:43,180
I think that that is kind of the
need of the German people to kind of,

316
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:47,980
I don't know, kind of like twist
history in that way to kind of blame

317
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,100
away from these people who
obviously did a lot of things wrong

318
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,680
in a way force Israel to have to kind
of take this berry like drastic sort of

319
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,560
extra legal action.
Okay.

320
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:04,330
But so I think you all make a now a number
of valid points, but somebody wants,

321
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:07,150
say, devil's advocate
would say, well look,

322
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,900
nobody's seriously alleging that he was
incorrectly convicted nobody seriously

323
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,570
alleging that he didn't do this.
Uh,

324
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,590
we've already said by assumption
if that they were working on the,

325
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,960
on the premise that if,
if they did and did,

326
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,090
if they didn't prosecute him,
he wasn't going to happen at all.

327
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,800
Um, so what's that? It
be that troubled about

328
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,580
is there,
is there a counterargument to that?

329
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,950
Yeah.
Over there.

330
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,140
Next time it might not be so clear.

331
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,770
Another country might use this
as a place for themselves.

332
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:03,090
Press it. An issue that, um, and what
are the precedents were worried about?

333
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,390
Okay.

334
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:04,751
Um,

335
00:22:04,751 --> 00:22:09,751
the precedent of claiming jurisdiction
over any number of crimes that occur

336
00:22:10,391 --> 00:22:11,224
elsewhere.

337
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:16,740
The precedent of basically kidnapping
in order to have a legal system,

338
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,560
the precedent of show trials

339
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:24,740
for serious, you know, it,
it potentially a huge issue.

340
00:22:24,741 --> 00:22:25,900
I don't know if you noticed,

341
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:29,620
um, uh, um,

342
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,450
Israeli politician Livni
when cans for the trip,

343
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:37,720
you're Britain a few weeks ago
because they discovered that,

344
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,643
uh,

345
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,040
some prosecutor in Britain was going
to have her arrested for war crimes in

346
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,124
Gaza.

347
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,490
She had been foreign minister during
the Gaza invasion and a year ago and the

348
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:55,570
British government was very embarrassed
and I tried to fix it so that that

349
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:57,970
couldn't be done again. But you know, um,

350
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:03,030
piano shag couldn't travel to many places
because he was eventually going to be

351
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:06,940
arrested. Um, there are, now,

352
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,220
there are some countries in which
their conversations about, uh,

353
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,860
whether they might try and arrest Donald
Rumsfeld if he travels to, to them.

354
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,630
Um, for, you know, what
went on at Abu Ghraib.

355
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:24,040
So if a, if countries starts
setting themselves up and saying,

356
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,530
we have the right to
prosecute war criminals,

357
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,463
mmm.

358
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,930
You know who, who's gotten,
how's it going to be regulated,

359
00:23:31,931 --> 00:23:36,220
who they're going to be answerable to
that. So that, those sorts of, if my,

360
00:23:36,221 --> 00:23:39,100
it might look okay in this case because

361
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,203
mmm,

362
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,480
we're not, you know, we,

363
00:23:42,481 --> 00:23:47,481
nobody seriously contends that Eifman
and do these things or that they were

364
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:52,400
legitimate, the justifiable. Uh,
but this is precedent setting issue,

365
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,360
uh, that you have to worry about it. Um,

366
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,270
anything else? Anything I haven't
mentioned that you might find troubling?

367
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,930
I mean, my, my, somebody not outside luck.

368
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,740
This guy is big.
It's not,

369
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:13,640
it's not just that it
Washington on Israeli soil.

370
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,670
This guy has big prosecuted
by a legal system,

371
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:20,990
which they didn't even exist when he quit,
when he committed his,

372
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,530
his crimes. And
furthermore, he was a bang,

373
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:27,830
a legal system that did
exist, right? He was,

374
00:24:27,831 --> 00:24:32,360
he was in Germany in the 1940s that bang,
uh,

375
00:24:32,361 --> 00:24:36,110
the laws of the third way.
He wasn't breaking any laws then.

376
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:37,730
Um,

377
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:42,470
and now he's being tried in a legal system
and a country that didn't even exist

378
00:24:42,471 --> 00:24:46,370
then, um, for violating other laws.

379
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,790
Isn't this isn't,
isn't this just victus justice?

380
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,193
Okay.

381
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,150
So why don't we say about that was,
was it, did they go the wrong thing?

382
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,290
A lot of people I think would,

383
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:13,380
would grant until much of that of what's
been said here and still be troubled by

384
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:16,450
the notion that they
shouldn't have done it because

385
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,140
you would never be brought to justice.

386
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:24,621
Okay.

387
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:29,621
Now let's take a step back from this
conversation and bring in what we were

388
00:25:30,051 --> 00:25:33,470
doing in the first half of our discussion.

389
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:39,200
Don't you think there's a tension now
between the two halves of our discussion?

390
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:42,920
Because when we were talking about what
made us uncomfortable about Eichmann,

391
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:44,923
it was his,

392
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:50,020
his abdicating his moral responsibility
to question the prevailing law,

393
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,820
to question

394
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,960
the legitimacy of what
he was being asked to do.

395
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,980
His odd and reflectiveness,
uh,

396
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:04,820
his lack of interest in the
overall goals of the enterprise.

397
00:26:04,821 --> 00:26:09,821
That he was part of this completely
unreflective person doing what he was told

398
00:26:10,251 --> 00:26:14,060
to do, a bang orders, trying to
produce his superiors and get ahead.

399
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,860
That's what made us sign comfortable.

400
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:20,450
But now when we talk about
what Israel did in 1960,

401
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,160
it seems like, uh, what makes
you uncomfortable there is,

402
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:30,140
um, the fact that they did do all
of those things. They did say,

403
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,420
they sat down and they said, well, yeah,

404
00:26:32,421 --> 00:26:36,140
there's international Lauren this
extradition, but hey, you know what,

405
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,140
it's not going to happen. Uh, and if, if,

406
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,560
if we want to get the
morally correct outcome here,

407
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,860
we have to take it upon ourselves not to
accept the existing rules of the game,

408
00:26:50,761 --> 00:26:53,460
not to accept the existing order,

409
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,400
but to stand up for what's right.

410
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:57,670
Okay.

411
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,860
So how is it that we,
on the one hand,

412
00:26:59,861 --> 00:27:03,910
are uncomfortable with Ironman
for failing to do that,

413
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,270
but here we're uncomfortable when,

414
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,840
when these Israeli,
um,

415
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,100
okay,

416
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,920
commandos and prosecutors do exactly that.

417
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,670
Is that a real contradiction
or is am I missing something?

418
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,270
Anybody want to pick up that?

419
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,313
What do you think?

420
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,950
So I, I do think it's a contradiction
in very worth examining,

421
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,330
but one sort of interesting aspect of
it is just that I think part of what we

422
00:27:39,331 --> 00:27:44,331
object to about the trial is that it
claimed to be following a certain legal

423
00:27:46,261 --> 00:27:47,420
order.
Um,

424
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:52,550
and that it sort of associated this
working outside the system with a cyst.

425
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:59,760
What is that legal with, with
these Israeli legal system? Um,

426
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:03,740
I mean with, with the judicial
court system of the nation.

427
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,140
But didn't, you know, even that
even, I mean, I, I take your point,

428
00:28:07,141 --> 00:28:12,000
but it's not very plausible. It's not
the best defense because after all, uh,

429
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,250
you know,
as it's come up in this conversation,

430
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:19,530
even by the standards of exist against
regular law, this was not a great,

431
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:24,220
right. What I'm saying is it, is it
this, this trial, which clearly wasn't,

432
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,470
which clearly, you know, broke a
lot of what we would consider the,

433
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,520
the good standards for trial sort of
tainted somehow the idea of the Israeli

434
00:28:32,801 --> 00:28:34,720
judicial system. I mean,
it seems like maybe,

435
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,610
I'm not saying this
would have been better,

436
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,640
but some of our objections wouldn't
necessarily apply if it had been really

437
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:47,821
obviously just like a
political assassination because
they didn't know what else

438
00:28:48,941 --> 00:28:52,840
to do with him. I mean, not
that that would be acceptable
either necessarily, but,

439
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:56,620
um, there's just the relation
to this to the courts. Okay.

440
00:28:56,621 --> 00:28:57,490
It's in there somehow too.

441
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,360
Okay.

442
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,450
Okay. So that might speak
to part of it, but any,

443
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,850
anything else about this tension between,

444
00:29:03,851 --> 00:29:06,610
on the one hand we are worried that,

445
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:11,760
that I advocated his moral autonomy
and responsibility on the other hand,

446
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:16,690
uh, where I'm comfortable that
they asserted their ass. Yeah.

447
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,130
Well,

448
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:22,780
I'm not really quite sure the tension
I'm completely exists if we're to assume

449
00:29:22,781 --> 00:29:27,130
that one system of government
or one system of laws is
like legitimate and valid,

450
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:30,100
um,
like the Israeli trial system,

451
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:34,660
like having a system that
lets you have appeals that,

452
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:39,220
um, doesn't, um, kidnap people illegally,

453
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:43,600
um, versus a system kills
millions of people, um,

454
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:46,060
who are innocent of doing anything wrong,
um,

455
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:49,420
and kills him simply for who they are.
Um,

456
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,190
so Eichmann's case,

457
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:55,810
it seems to me that it is legitimate to
challenge him to challenge the system

458
00:29:55,811 --> 00:29:56,780
and to um,

459
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,080
be shocked or disappointed when he
doesn't then just goes along with it. Um,

460
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,880
on the other hand, to bring
someone like that to justice, um,

461
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,450
it is a bit troubling that, um, when
you have a system that does work, um,

462
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,410
or that we widely believed to
be a system that, um, like a,

463
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:17,450
a judicial system that does work and
is sort of widely accepted to be a good

464
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:19,390
system.
Um,

465
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:23,530
setting a precedent there could
be potentially a bad thing.

466
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,730
I'm not quite sure there's attention if
in one case challenging the system is

467
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:29,320
good and the other may be challenging.

468
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:32,260
The system has more of
a gray area of issues.

469
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:36,470
Well, I think you've hit the nail
on the head. I think that, uh,

470
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:40,970
the pension goes away if we say, well, uh,

471
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,140
you know,

472
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:47,140
the reason we are troubled by Eichmann's
failure to ask any questions about the,

473
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,180
the,
the,

474
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:55,900
what he was being asked to do within the
legal order of the Third Reich is that

475
00:30:56,031 --> 00:31:00,940
it was an illegitimate legal
order. It was, uh, as, uh,

476
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,970
RN says somewhere in that
was a criminal regime. Um,

477
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:09,440
and it was his failure to recognize
that that makes us uncomfortable.

478
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:14,210
On the other hand, when we start talking
about the system of international law,

479
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,720
um,
it has its imperfections,

480
00:31:17,721 --> 00:31:21,680
but we're much more ambivalent about
saying people can ignore it with impunity

481
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:26,800
because we don't see it as an illegitimate
order in the same way that we did.

482
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,550
Um, so I think you're exactly right.
When you, when you point out that,

483
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,360
that the apparent, this is not a real
tension, it's an apparent tension,

484
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:40,570
which depends for appearing to
be attention on the fact that we,

485
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,130
most of us don't have any qualms in
thinking about the third wife has an

486
00:31:46,131 --> 00:31:47,940
illegitimate regime.
Uh,

487
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:52,370
and that that's why we're
uncomfortable with his actions.

488
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:57,200
Whereas a, when you do have
at least a Fred's lane, uh,

489
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,830
legitimate international legal order,
uh,

490
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:04,760
we become uncomfortable with people who
flout that. So I think that's right.

491
00:32:04,761 --> 00:32:09,761
But it places the central question of
this course into sharp relief because our

492
00:32:11,631 --> 00:32:15,620
question is, well, what is it that makes
it a regime legitimate or illegitimate?

493
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:16,521
You know,

494
00:32:16,521 --> 00:32:21,521
if we say you have an ob an an obligation
to resist an illegitimate regime and

495
00:32:22,701 --> 00:32:25,040
to obey and legitimate one,
uh,

496
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:28,250
that just pushes the question
one step further back,

497
00:32:28,251 --> 00:32:32,600
what is it that makes her
regime legitimate? And, um,

498
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:36,060
that is the question that we're going to,
uh,

499
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:39,860
organize our discussion in the,

500
00:32:39,861 --> 00:32:42,020
in the coming weeks and months.

501
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:47,350
We're basically going to explore five
answers to that question or five types of

502
00:32:47,721 --> 00:32:51,650
answers are five classes of
answers to that question.

503
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:57,050
And they represent the main ways in which
political legitimacy has been thought

504
00:32:57,051 --> 00:33:01,610
about in the western tradition over
the past several hundred years.

505
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,163
Um,

506
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:08,320
the first one that we're going to look
at is the utilitarian tradition and the

507
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:14,030
utilitarian tradition, which we are
going to trace back to Jeremy Bentham.

508
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,750
Um,
we'll start talking about on Friday,

509
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,200
says that a regime is legitimate to the
extent that it maximizes the greatest

510
00:33:23,991 --> 00:33:28,610
happiness of the greatest
number of its citizens.

511
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,343
Now,

512
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:36,050
there's huge arguments within the
utilitarian tradition as to what counts as

513
00:33:37,101 --> 00:33:39,080
happiness,
how you measure it,

514
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:44,410
what you do if promoting the happiness
of SOM comes at the expense of the

515
00:33:45,201 --> 00:33:48,050
happiness of others.
Um,

516
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:53,140
all of those things get argued about
endlessly in the utilitarian tradition.

517
00:33:54,921 --> 00:33:59,660
And we will explore some of
those arguments as we go along.

518
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,670
But the basic idea is that good regimes,
legitimate regimes,

519
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:10,030
maximize the utility or the happiness
of people who are subject to them.

520
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,200
And then the second

521
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,110
set of answers,

522
00:34:18,111 --> 00:34:21,740
the second tradition we're going to
look at is the Marxist tradition,

523
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:24,560
which comes into its
own in the 19th century.

524
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:30,190
And that basically identifies
the legitimacy of the
state with the presence or

525
00:34:32,151 --> 00:34:33,980
absence of exploitation.

526
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:40,670
Legitimate governments are those
that try to prevent exploitation and

527
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:45,050
illegitimate governments or those
that facilitate exploitation.

528
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,620
Again,
just as in the utilitarian tradition,

529
00:34:48,621 --> 00:34:53,621
there are huge disagreements about how
to identify utility and measure it in the

530
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:57,170
Marxian tradition from the beginning.
Uh,

531
00:34:57,171 --> 00:35:01,190
there've been huge disagreement
about what constitutes exploitation,

532
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,140
how you would note when you see it,

533
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:08,150
what would be involved in eradicating it
and how governments might or might not

534
00:35:08,151 --> 00:35:11,840
be able to do that. Um,
but at the end of the day,

535
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:16,841
it is the presence of exploitation that
is the marker of an illegitimate order

536
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,640
and it's the possibility of escaping,
um,

537
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:26,540
exploitation that creates the
possibility of a legitimate order.

538
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:30,290
And so the Marxian answer to
the question of legitimate,

539
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:35,291
the legitimacy revolves around
this idea of exploitation.

540
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,510
The third tradition
we've got to look at is,

541
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:44,430
is what's commonly known as the social
contract tradition and the social

542
00:35:44,431 --> 00:35:49,431
contract tradition founds the legitimacy
of a political order in the notion of

543
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:56,600
consent agreement.
Again,

544
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,720
you'll find just us with
all these other traditions,

545
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,560
a lot of disagreement about
what constitutes agreement,

546
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,540
what constitutes consent?

547
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:10,820
Is it some people who actually
agreed at some point in the past

548
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,180
that should bind us? You know, the,

549
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:18,190
the American founders agreed on certain
things and therefore we should be bound

550
00:36:18,191 --> 00:36:23,191
by what they were agreed upon or is it
what any rational person would agree to?

551
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,950
Is it a hypothetical idea of consent?
Um,

552
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,340
does the consent have to be active?

553
00:36:30,341 --> 00:36:33,960
Do people actually have to engage
in consent or can it be tacit?

554
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:37,300
Can you demonstrate your
consent simply by not leaving?

555
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,190
All of these issues will get,
um,

556
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,470
a lot of attention when we look
at the social contract tradition,

557
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,040
but in all up for all of their
internal differences and disagreements,

558
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:56,820
this social contract tradition comes down
to the proposition that the legitimacy

559
00:36:57,371 --> 00:37:01,810
of the state is rooted in
the consent of the governed.

560
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,570
The fourth tradition
we're going to consider

561
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:13,990
is what I call and the syllabus and the
Anti Enlightenment tradition reacting

562
00:37:13,991 --> 00:37:18,991
against those first three enlightenment
traditions and the anti enlightened

563
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:25,720
tradition appeals to tradition. Um,
it, it's the tradition tradition.

564
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,840
Um,
the legitimacy of this state

565
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,920
resides and is discovered in

566
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:38,970
the inherited norms,
practices and traditions off a society.

567
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,111
Again,

568
00:37:40,111 --> 00:37:44,970
we will find people struggling with
and arguing over what constitutes the

569
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:48,390
tradition, how you all know a
tradition when you trip over it.

570
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:53,460
What happens when people disagree
about what the tradition implies.

571
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,480
Um,

572
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,480
all those questions are on the table
once we start appealing to tradition.

573
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:04,800
But, um, at the end of the day, it is,

574
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:09,830
it is the appeal to tradition itself
that becomes important that when you

575
00:38:09,991 --> 00:38:12,930
criticize the government,
you have to um,

576
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,090
yeah,

577
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:19,410
appeal to something that's
imminent in an accepted,

578
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:24,690
in the tradition. Um, the
rights of Englishman, let's say,

579
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,910
um,
as it was appeal to in the 18th century.

580
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,103
Um,

581
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,620
and then there's a tradition about what
the rights of Englishman of thought to

582
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:38,200
the beam going all the way
back to Magna Carta. Um,

583
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:43,290
that becomes the basis for arguing about
the legitimacy of the price and actions

584
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:44,194
of the government.

585
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:49,050
The faith tradition we're going to look
at is the democratic tradition and the

586
00:38:49,051 --> 00:38:52,230
democratic tradition says that

587
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:59,180
the legitimacy of the state depends upon
the extent to which it abays something

588
00:39:00,511 --> 00:39:03,090
which we'll call the principle
of affected interests.

589
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,600
That is whether those people
whose interests are affected
by its actions get to

590
00:39:09,121 --> 00:39:10,350
control what it does

591
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:14,170
cause cousin enough consent you might say.

592
00:39:14,171 --> 00:39:19,030
And indeed the democratic tradition is
a close cousin of the social contract

593
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:23,230
tradition. But at the end of the
day it's a different tradition. Um,

594
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,800
and often works through but not
always the idea of majority rule.

595
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,420
And the, so the, again,

596
00:39:31,421 --> 00:39:36,421
in the democratic tradition there
are huge controversies about how we

597
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:42,241
operationalize and apply this idea of
affected anxious is the basis of politics.

598
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,251
Um,
but the,

599
00:39:43,251 --> 00:39:48,251
the underlying notion is that if you
couldn't resolve those issues trying to

600
00:39:49,391 --> 00:39:53,210
make the government,
the um,

601
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,800
agent of people who are affected by
what it does is the name of the game in

602
00:40:01,311 --> 00:40:06,311
promoting legitimacy and undermining
illegitimacy of the steak.

603
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,700
So those are the,
those are the five traditions.

604
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:13,550
We're going to explore them and we're
going to come back again and again,

605
00:40:13,551 --> 00:40:17,630
not only to the Eichmann problem,
but to

606
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,760
are there practical examples that throw
this question of the legitimacy of the

607
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:29,620
state into sharp relief.
But at the end of the day,

608
00:40:29,621 --> 00:40:34,270
we are always trying to understand
what the basis for political legitimacy

609
00:40:34,271 --> 00:40:35,320
actually is.

610
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:37,800
Okay.

611
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,960
We have a couple of
minutes for questions if,

612
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:40,680
okay.

613
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,540
Anyone would like to,

614
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,000
yeah,
it's Mike over here.

615
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:55,241
Oh,

616
00:40:55,241 --> 00:40:59,440
what about the notion that might makes
right and at the most powerful stays the

617
00:40:59,441 --> 00:41:00,310
most legitimate.

618
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,260
Okay. Says what about the
notion that might makes, right.

619
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:08,910
And it's the most powerful states that
get the deed to dictate what legitimacy

620
00:41:08,911 --> 00:41:12,840
is. I mean, you could say that after
all, you know, when, if you think,

621
00:41:12,841 --> 00:41:16,410
think about the example
we've been considering today,

622
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,090
at the end of the Second World War,
um,

623
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:22,650
we had the Nuremberg trials run by,
you know,

624
00:41:22,651 --> 00:41:26,160
an American Supreme Court justice.
They went to Germany.

625
00:41:26,161 --> 00:41:29,730
They did a lot of what Israel
did in 1960. Actually, you know,

626
00:41:29,731 --> 00:41:32,700
they tried these Germans by,
uh,

627
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:37,220
laws hadn't existed at the time for
obeying the laws that had existed at that

628
00:41:37,221 --> 00:41:40,940
time. Many of them were executed. Many
of them were in prison. You could say,

629
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:45,560
this is just, this is just,
um, might, makes, right.

630
00:41:45,561 --> 00:41:50,090
If somebody else had won the war, there
would have been a different outcome. Um,

631
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,900
so this is a, this is a doctrine
which we will consider in the,

632
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:58,580
in the course of our discussion
actually of utilitarianism. Um,

633
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:03,610
it is for those of you who want the
jargon that the doctrine of legal

634
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,760
positivism,

635
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:10,040
anyone want to take a crack at
what legal positivism means?

636
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,070
Anybody know?
No reason you should know

637
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,780
legal positivism was
the doctrine that said,

638
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,350
okay,

639
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:24,630
exactly what this gentleman
here has been saying,

640
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,193
that

641
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:32,420
what makes something law is the bell.
The ability to get people to obey.

642
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:34,300
Yeah.

643
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,770
You know,
if you go back into medieval Europe,

644
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,660
we'll find the distinction between
natural law and positive law.

645
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:46,740
Natural law is sometimes I
identified with the will of God,

646
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:50,100
sometimes with timeless
universal moral principles,

647
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:55,340
some higher law by reference to which we
judge what actual legal systems go are

648
00:42:57,931 --> 00:42:58,650
doing.

649
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:03,630
So when we say the Third Reich was a
criminal regime and illegitimate regime

650
00:43:03,631 --> 00:43:06,480
where ultimately appealing
to some kind of higher laws,

651
00:43:06,481 --> 00:43:11,481
some natural law idea as to what
constitutes a legitimate regime.

652
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:17,100
Right? And we're going to talk a
lot more about natural law later.

653
00:43:17,101 --> 00:43:17,934
Well,

654
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,530
legal positivism was the doctrine that
there is no such thing as natural law.

655
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:28,040
Jeremy Bentham who are going to start
talking about on Friday says natural law,

656
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:33,780
natural rights. It's dangerous
nonsense, nonsense on stilts.

657
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:39,500
There's no such thing as natural law
and he is considered as the one of the,

658
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:42,683
um,

659
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:48,030
intellectual sources for this
doctrine of legal positivism,

660
00:43:48,031 --> 00:43:51,760
which comes into its own in the
19 century. They're just there.

661
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,220
If you know, you, if you say,
well, there is no higher law,

662
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:58,260
then the question is,
well then why didn't,

663
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,950
what is law based on one and say is power?

664
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,280
Bentham wanted to say it
should be based on science.

665
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:07,080
As I mentioned to you last time,

666
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:12,020
the enlightenment is all
about faith in science. Um,

667
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,650
so we,
we will,

668
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,210
we will consider a version of that
argument when we come to talk about

669
00:44:18,211 --> 00:44:22,110
utilitarianism. Um, but it's a,

670
00:44:22,111 --> 00:44:24,780
it's a good point to make,
particularly in this,

671
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:29,580
the context of the Eichmann problem.
Now what we're gonna,

672
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:32,700
what we're gonna do.
I realize now,

673
00:44:32,701 --> 00:44:36,600
I misspoke when I said we're going to
talk about Bentham on fire. I didn't,

674
00:44:36,601 --> 00:44:40,890
I didn't, why didn't some
astute person say, no,

675
00:44:40,891 --> 00:44:45,150
you're not.
We're actually going to talk about lock.

676
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:48,180
Now you might say,
well why are you going to talk about loc?

677
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:53,810
And the answer is that lock actually
performs two different functions in this

678
00:44:53,881 --> 00:44:58,360
course, um, that you
will see they, they, uh,

679
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:01,620
they come together, uh, later on.

680
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:04,620
You'll see how they come
together later in the course.

681
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:10,160
But a lock on the one hand we are using
as somebody to provide us with a way of

682
00:45:12,511 --> 00:45:14,640
understanding the enlightenment.

683
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:16,170
Yeah.

684
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:18,390
Move in politics.
And as I sent you,

685
00:45:18,391 --> 00:45:23,391
the enlightenment move involves a twin
commitment to the ideas of science as the

686
00:45:24,031 --> 00:45:28,740
basis for social organization and

687
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,090
freedom as the highest good.

688
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:38,870
And that that enlightenment pair of
assumptions is going to inform the first

689
00:45:39,421 --> 00:45:42,720
three traditions we look at,
right? The utilitarian tradition,

690
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:48,350
the Marxian tradition and
the social contract tradition
lock will also be looked

691
00:45:49,231 --> 00:45:53,100
at later as a representative of
the social contract tradition.

692
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,880
But what are we going to do in Friday's
lecture is think about the broad themes

693
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:01,770
of the enlightenment for which,
uh,

694
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,850
the lock reading it is there
and what, and, and it's,

695
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,030
it's going to provide the background
and we will not actually get to

696
00:46:09,031 --> 00:46:12,600
utilitarianism until next Wednesday.

697
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:18,300
One thing I would say to
you about the lock, uh,

698
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,020
going in on the one hand, and you know,

699
00:46:22,021 --> 00:46:27,021
it's a tremendously famous buckets being
in print continuously for more than 300

700
00:46:27,421 --> 00:46:31,740
years, it's been translated into
all the world's languages. Um,

701
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:35,880
all the world's major languages and
many of the world's mine languages,

702
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,620
um, locks most important
political writing for sure.

703
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:42,100
Okay.

704
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:46,900
Uh, it's not a fast weed. It's not, um,

705
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,980
it's a political pamphlet. It, you know,

706
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:52,270
it was written for a very particular
political purpose that I'll tell you

707
00:46:52,271 --> 00:46:54,210
something about,
but it's,

708
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:57,760
it's not a fast we'd in the sense
that what you read for today,

709
00:46:57,761 --> 00:47:01,300
it's a fast read and some of
it's gonna go right by you.

710
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:06,520
And that's okay. Um, because you might,

711
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:09,550
you might think, well, not
only is it not a fast read,

712
00:47:09,551 --> 00:47:12,730
but he's going to do a lot
of this in one lecture. Uh,

713
00:47:12,731 --> 00:47:14,920
it seems like a lot to do in 15 minutes,

714
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,420
but the truth is we're going to come
back to lock again and again through this

715
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:20,890
course and you,

716
00:47:20,891 --> 00:47:25,891
what you're going to discover is that
the ghost of Locke is hovering behind us,

717
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,910
uh, all the way through. Um, in many ways,

718
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:35,650
modern democratic theory is a footnote
to lock a, and you'll, so you'll see,

719
00:47:35,651 --> 00:47:40,420
we will consider lock as a father of
the enlightenment as a representative of

720
00:47:40,421 --> 00:47:45,340
the social contract tradition. And then
lockin considerations will come in,

721
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:50,050
uh, to the Marxist tradition,
to the democratic tradition, uh,

722
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:54,280
to the social contract
tradition, uh, as well. So,

723
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:57,970
um,
some of what you read for Friday,

724
00:47:57,971 --> 00:48:02,680
we'll go by you don't worry about it
because we're going to revisit lock again

725
00:48:02,681 --> 00:48:06,130
and again and again, uh, as
we go through the course.

726
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:10,240
Okay?
So we will see you on Friday.

727
00:48:10,241 --> 00:48:13,450
And then that's when we'll
begin talking about John Law.
