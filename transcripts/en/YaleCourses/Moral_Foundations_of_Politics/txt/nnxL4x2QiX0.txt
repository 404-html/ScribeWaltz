Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. So our task today is to finish up teaching, uh, about roles. And then I'm going to take a step back and look at the, where we've gotten to so far in today's cores, because we're really entering a transition moment, uh, from the enlightenment to the Anti Enlightenment, which with which is what we'll begin with on Wednesday. So we had just, just to recap briefly, um, we had been talking about roles as two principles of justice, which were really three principles of justice. One for the distribution of liberties, which was his most expansive system, consistent, a compatible with the like liberty for one specific principle of equality, of opportunity, which is to be in his lexical ranking, which was some reason known only to John Rawls comes before two a and the third one was to a, this, this so called difference principle or what used to be called in welfare economics, the Maxine men principle, which says, maximize the minimum.

Speaker 1:          01:12          Cher and I had explained to you why Rawls thinks the standpoint of justice is the standpoint of the most adversely affected, which is not a bleeding heart idea, but rather this universal izable idea, this notion that if you can affirm a principal, even from the standpoint of that those people who are most adversely affected by it, you'll affirm it from every other conceivable standpoint as well. And so this translated into these L-shaped indifference curves her, if we start with a distribution like that, um, anywhere in this area would be preferred because all roles is interested in is it is maximizing that distance. Um, that is the, the, the size of the share at the bottom. He seem different to who has that share. Um, so that say an x to move from x to f of here would be an improvement for roles even though, um, it's, it's a clearly a massive loss to a and a huge gain to be a, he's not interested in that.

Speaker 1:          02:27          The point is that the distance from the, the, um, access to f is greater here than the distance from the axis to x is there. And that's the only key. That's the only relevant consideration. Um, now, sometimes roles is called an egalitarian and as I began to point out to you at the end of Wednesday's lecture, that's really misleading. His principal is rather very undead determined. That is to say, um, if we compare it with the parade principle, it's completely contains within it the parade oh principle. So that if somebody came along and said, well, the best way to benefit the people at the bottom is to have markets, um, trickled down, let's say that that the pie will grow the most and the people at the bottom will benefit the most from a pure market system. Roles would say fine. Um, because everything that is Paredo superior is also rolls preferred.

Speaker 1:          03:37          On the other hand, if somebody came and made the case that heavy state intervention to redistribute would in fact work to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged, then he would agree with that as well. And so you can conjure up, um, egalitarian results that a compatible, uh, with the roles he and scheme or Anti-gang attarian results of further consideration comes in here. When we stopped just talking about the worst off individual because, um, you can start to think about, well, what happens if you get a small marginal increment for the person at the bottom, um, paid for by massive cuts on the middle class and perhaps big benefits to the very wealthy. And I mentioned the example of the Reagan tax cuts in the 1980s, which had that structure roles would have no objection to that either, even though from an egalitarian perspective that would look like I regress of redistribution, uh, from the status quo in 1980.

Speaker 1:          04:49          Um, so it's a very under determined principle. It's not necessarily egalitarian or necessarily anti-gang attarian all it says is arrange things to the greatest benefit of the person at the bottom. And I, as I think I mentioned to you, roles took a lot of criticism in the 1970s in 1980s from people who would plow all the way through to page 300 and whatever it is in his book, uh, to learn that role says he's agnostic between capitalism and socialism. And people say, well, to read 300 pages of a book about justice and discover the author is agnostic between the two main political ICAN economic systems of the 20th century is an exactly, um, satisfying. Um, but roles as answer as I said is which type of political economic system actually operates to. The benefit of the person at the bottom is not a question for political theorists.

Speaker 1:          05:54          That's a question maybe for a political maybe for trial and error through policy innovation. Um, it's going to have to get hammered out in the real world of practical political economy. And so it's not a critique of their roles in standard that, um, it's undetermined with respect to the choice of actual political economic systems. And I think that Rawls is on relatively firm ground there. We wouldn't want to think that what, what political economy is the most efficient from the standpoint of benefiting people at the bottom is really a philosophical question when clearly it is not. So that's the roles in story. I gave you the big picture at the beginning, uh, his, his general conception of distributive justice. And then these more specific principles that get added in the course of trying to figure out, um, how the, the general conception of justice can, can actually be applied.

Speaker 1:          07:05          Now I want to take a step back. I'm going to come back to roles a little bit later, but I want to take a step back first and, and think about where we've come from. Uh, and then we'll see how roles, uh, leads us to think about where we've gotten to. We started out this course by talking about enlightenment, political theory, the enlightenment being a philosophical movement that really starts in the 17th century but gathers steam in the 18th century. And I said that fall from the point of view of political arrangements, there were really two core values of the enlightenment. One was to a commitment to the idea of individual freedom as realized through a doctrine of individual rights as the most important value in politics. And the second was a commitment to science reason and science as the basis of politics rather than things that had prevailed hit a to such as natural law or tradition or natural rights or religious argument that rare that the move, which we source so dramatically with Bentham but has been present, he won our way or another with everybody we've looked at.

Speaker 1:          08:27          The move is to say, no, we're not going to appeal to tradition. We're not going to appeal to religion. We're not going to appeal to natural law and natural rights. We're going to appeal to the idea of science. Science understood through reason. And so those are the two twin ideas, which one way or another have shaped every single theorist that we've looked at. So starting with the commitment to science, remember those early enlightenment theorists were very different from modern enlightenment thinkers in that they identified science with certainty. Remember the, the I, the Cartesian idea that you have certainty about the contents of your own mind or locks, uh, locks point that, that only we have that kind of privileged access into the contents of our own soul. Remember his famous line to the effect that, um, true and Inwood a true and lasting conviction requires inward persuasion of the mind.

Speaker 1:          09:38          And that can't be forced on anybody, uh, by the magistrate or, or anybody else. That this is internal certainty is so important. And for Hobbs, we saw that, um, it's this w knowledge has its basis in willing thing. So, um, we got this raw, the curious result that he said, you know, uh, the, the laws of geometry have the force of laws because they're the product of wills. We make the triangle, if you like. And the laws of politics were like the laws of geometry because we make the Commonwealth in the same way that we make the triangle a and that therefore, in the early enlightenment, there was this, this enormous emphasis on certainty as the hallmark of science. But then we saw as we moved into the mature enlightenment with people like John Stuart Mill, that actually they had a very different view of science, that the hallmark of science was fallible.

Speaker 1:          10:42          Isn't that everything we think, we know a is subject to doubt. There isn't anything in, in, uh, reasoning about the real world that meets the Cartesian a criterion of being impossible to doubt what we think we know is always revisable in the light of more evidence, uh, and, and bed scientific investigation and mills defense of the marketplace, of ideas and of competition. Uh, and argument was precisely to encourage that. And so, um, the longs chapter on freedom of thought and action in, uh, in on liberty is really about, remember how we get from, from, uh, freedom to utility via a system that allows the truth to come out, name me a system in which ideas have to confront contrarian ideas in the marketplace, uh, of public speech. And that, that, that, uh, science is, is it really a process, uh, which, which makes it possible or more possible than any other process for us to approximate the truth.

Speaker 1:          11:57          But that's something very different from having this notion of certainty. So the commitment to science becomes the commitment to Falabella awesome. Uh, and the commitment to assist them, which, which has room in it for, um, experimental, uh, searching after the truth as an as a perpetual feature of human social association. Now when we look at Rawls and Nozick and the social contract theorists, um, we find in at least in some respects, it's sort of throw back to the early enlightenment at least in the, in the Nozick and the roles that you've, we've talked about today. That is to say, um, they are looking for a unique answer to the question, what principles would people agree upon if they would designing society of fresh and the, this hypothetical social contract a so called depends on the idea that there's a unique answer to that question, right? So they can see that there never was a social contract, but they say, suppose we were designing the rules from scratch, what rules would we design even though no society was having created in that way?

Speaker 1:          13:22          And the the, the thought was, well, if there's an answer to that question, if there's a definitive answer to that question, then we have a standard, a yardstick for measuring actual institutional arrangements. That is to say societies that come closer to that standard can be judged better than societies that are further from it. And as societies evolve over time, if they evolve toward it, there'll be improving and if they evolved away from it, they would be getting worse. So this was the Cancerian or I called neo con t and aspiration to come up with a standard which any rational person must on reflection, affirm. And if you can say what that is, then you have your yardstick by reference to which you can look at actual political and social arrangements and it might be worth pausing just for a second to notice that Emmanuel concave himself, who we did and read it in this course.

Speaker 1:          14:28          So you'll have to just take it on faith from me. Conn himself was deeply skeptical that that could be done because he thought that social and political arrangements are inevitably dependent on empirical considerations. And you're not going to get you an the universal laws about those things. So conn himself would have been skeptical of the roles in a project you to say, you're not going to be able to get empirical propositions about the organization of society that are going to rise to this level of a categorical imperative. And I think that that one implication about discussion of roles is that con was in fact right, that um, for example, um, roles, a story about protecting the position of the person at the bottom as tsums an enormous degree of risk aversion. Now he had an answer for why he said, well, there's no necessary relationship between the level of economic development and what the, the fortunes of the person at the bottom.

Speaker 1:          15:41          So you had that graves risk assumption, but we saw that even that becomes problematic if you think about very marginal improvements in the condition that the person at the bottom coming at enormous costs for the person a little bit higher up. It's not at all clear that the rational thing to do would be always to add, no matter what cost to preserve the condition of the person at the bottom. Important a article about this published by John Harsanyi in 1975, I'll use that. If you really think that, um, people have a rational view of risk, it would make more sense to choose utilitarian Nissam behind the veil of ignorance. Then it would make to choose, uh, the Rawlsian commitment to, uh, maximizing the position of the person at the bottom. Now it's not obvious that Harsanyi is right, but nor is it obvious that rolls is right.

Speaker 1:          16:47          And once you, once you make that, um, admission, then you no longer have a unique answer. You say, well, we plugged one set of psychological assumptions in about risk and we get roles, we play a different set of assumptions of in about risk and we get Harsanyi. And so it's all being driven by the assumptions about human psychology that we plug into the model. And of course, once you, you recognize that, then you don't have a unique answer. Um, another way of putting it is that the young roles was rather naive about what is uncontroversial in economics, psychology and sociology that is rolls made a distinction between the laws of psychology and economics as he put them, uh, which we do have knowledge of behind the veil of ignorance in which he was treating as uncontroversial. And then the specific knowledge that we have about our particular life plans, goals and so on, which he kept hidden from us.

Speaker 1:          17:54          But it turns out that there are very few uncontroversial assumptions about human psychology or economics and so you can't get unique answers. And indeed, uh, if we own a restrict ourselves to economics, one of the most interesting developments in economics of the past decade is precisely the turn away from standard economistic assumptions into the field of psychology to see how preferences are formed, why people have the risk profiles that they do and so on. And much of modern behavioral economics regards as subjects with study rather than the thing, then a axiomatic assumptions, the sorts of things roles wanted to work with. So there isn't a unique answer. Now, as it turns out, as roles became a older, he realized that this neo con tn venture was belt upon a hell of sand and that he wasn't going to be able to make cons, ethics, do the work and social contract theory that traditionally had been done by natural law that for the reason that I just gave you, you're not going to actually be able to get unique results out of it.

Speaker 1:          19:22          And so the mature rolls made a different kind of move, which in some ways is an even bigger retreat from the early enlightenment then was males retreat to Falabella. Awesome. And that is the move that comes under the heading of political, not metaphysical. And that's the name of the sub title of the article I had you reading about, uh, for today. And so he is the intuition. It's counterintuitive and Ted Hughes thinking it through. Um, but then I think it's actually quite a powerful intuition. Um, and I'm going to, I'm going to explain it to you actually, not by reference to roles, but by another person called Cass Sunstein who's a lawyer at the University of Chicago who might want, you might hear a lot about him cause he's on the long short list, uh, for Obama picks for the Supreme Court. Uh, so cass Sunstein might be in the news stay tuned, but Sunstein has had a different slogan, not political, not metaphysical, but rather what he called a theory of in incompletely theorized agreement. Now let these, this is not an elegant term, but let me give you the, the, um, the intuition here. We often think when we think about political disagreement, we often think, well, people are Kinda agree on very general things and the devil is in the details. People can agree, you know, that read is good, but they can't agree on what is actually required for freedom. When you get down to brass tacks of arguing about policies, you know,

Speaker 2:          21:11          mmm.

Speaker 1:          21:13          Does having universal is this freedom require people have universal health care? Some people say yes, some people say no. All right. So, so one view of political disagreement is we can agree at a very high altitude, but then when you start to get into, uh, the dirty particulars of everyday life, uh, then we can't agree.

Speaker 2:          21:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:36          Sunstein and roles in his political not metaphysical mode have the almost opposite tuition to that. And so, so here the, the, the sort of example would be, well,

Speaker 2:          21:54          okay,

Speaker 1:          21:54          think about a, a faculty in the university trying to decide whether or not a junior person should get tenure. They might be able to agree that the person should get tenure without being able to agree in a million years about why the person should get tenure. Or when we think of Congress passing a piece of legislation, when we think of Congress passing the healthcare bill, uh, that just went through a warts and all through the house.

Speaker 2:          22:33          MMM.

Speaker 1:          22:35          You know, you get the votes, but if those people have to agree upon why they were voting for, they couldn't, they couldn't agree in the mail. Yeah. If they all have different reasons for why they're voting for it or why they're voting against it for that matter. Right. So the notion of incompletely theorized agreement is, you know, why we don't care, we don't care or rolls this idea of political, not metaphysical, it's, it's the question is what political arrangements would people with very different values, commitments, worldviews, metaphysical systems, what would they agree on? What would be to use another one of Rose's terms? What would be the overlapping consensus? Thank you. Sort of, you know, a big Venn diagram was where you've gotten a lot of circles. Mostly not overlapping, but they all overlap at [inaudible] in one area.

Speaker 2:          23:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          23:43          That's the overlapping. Okay. And we don't care about the parts that don't overlap.

Speaker 1:          23:51          So we, it's, it's much less rationalistic. Lee ambitious. Cause now if you think back to the first principle, we don't have to say that the fundamentalist would agree that she or he has as much free, has more freedom in a disestablished church regime than the non fundamentalist would have in the fundamentalist regime. All we have to say is that the, the fundamentalist accepts this. We don't know why. We don't care why. So that's the notion of incompletely theorized agreement or political, not metaphysical. We're just going to look for water where it, what is the overlapping consensus for people with very different worldviews, metaphysical systems, beliefs, et cetera. Okay? And so, so another way you can think about this is,

Speaker 2:          24:50          okay,

Speaker 1:          24:51          instead of saying, first I'm going to convince you of my metaphysics and epistemology and my theory of science, and then when I've persuaded you about all of those things, I'm going to show you how my political theory follows on this. Sunstein or mature role's view. That's a Mug's game. You never going to do it because people are never going to agree about all of those things. And more important for politics. We know need them to agree about all of those things. All we need to do is find the overlapping consensus,

Speaker 2:          25:27          uh,

Speaker 1:          25:30          uh, that they will affirm. So they might, they might affirm a series of, of political arrangements, institutions for very different reasons from one another. And it doesn't matter. We don't need it to be any more robust than that. And so that's where the mature roles winds up. And as we'll see in the final lectures of this course, there is a certain democratic element to this, but it's under theorized in roles. And I, and the, the analogy I will, I'll just mention and I'll come back to it later in the course is the analogy is the secret ballot.

Speaker 2:          26:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:11          We don't require people to give reasons for the way in which they vote. They can have reasons for choosing the same candidate as we choose that we would regard as completely idiotic. We don't care.

Speaker 2:          26:29          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:29          Right. So there's this, the, this political, not metaphysical move or the incompletely theorized agreement move is, is analogous to the idea of the secret ballot in that we become much less of, people don't have to have good reasons for voting the way they do their reasons are there private business. Okay. And so the political, not metaphysical move bills on that kind of intuition. And obviously it's a huge retreat from the original enlightenment motivation to get principles that must follow scientifically.

Speaker 2:          27:15          MMM.

Speaker 1:          27:16          For any clear headed thinking person. So the mature roles is a, is a kind of extreme retreat you might say, even though the young roles is, is uh, you know, an enlightenment thinker with all the zeal of a Jeremy Bentham, the mature roles really gives up on the enlightenment project. Um, and of course you then get into the question, he still thinks his is three principles would be affirmed. He thinks these three principles are part of the, of, of, or are part of this overlapping consensus. But he has no way of knowing that that in fact is true. Uh, it just an assertion, uh, that it's true and we, it's not necessarily the case. So, um, what I'm going to suggest to you in later lectures that is that rolls actually retreats too far from the enlightenment project and that there's a way of thinking about the mature enlightenment that's consistent with, um, uh, democratic political outlook that doesn't give up so completely as the political, not metaphysical view dies on the alignment project. But that's for the future. Let's first focus on the other element of the enlightenment. I said the, the, the one was this commitment to science. And we've seen how that played out now from the 17th century to the late 20th century in this gradual re this affirmation. But this gradual retreat from certainty

Speaker 1:          28:57          that mark the march from the early enlightenment thinkers through mail two roles Sunstein and others. But now let's focus on the idea, the normative idea of individual rights. Remember we said that, um, the most input, the sooner bonem the most important value of the, of the enlightenment. This, this idea of individual freedom recognized or, or institutionalized by doctrine of individual rights, the rights of the individual are somehow sacrosanct. And we saw that in the early enlightenment. This had a theological basis. Remember I said to you that, uh, lock was tormented by the theological controversy between the two sides. Uh, some of them said, uh, uh, God is omnipotent. But if you said God is omnipotent, that seemed to, uh, undermine the idea that the laws of nature could be timeless because if God is omnipotent, he could chai it, decided to change them tomorrow. So, uh, either God is omnipotent or the laws of nature of time has been not both.

Speaker 1:          30:14          And he wrestled with that. If you've gone and read his essays on the law of nature, published in 1660, you see him really tormenting himself. But at the end of his life, he comes down firmly on the, on what we call the will based theory, the idea that something can be a law unless it's a product of a well. And so, um, we'll go with the omnipotence and let the omniscience fall by and let the universalism fall by the wayside. And so that was the idea, uh, of, uh, God owns his creation because he made it and God knows his creation because he made it. And then the move lock makes is that God gave us the capacity to make things for ourselves. We become, as he called, you know, miniature gods that so long as we act within the constraints of the law of nature, we can behave, uh, in our realm in a way that's an analogy of the way God behaves in his realm.

Speaker 1:          31:15          We can create, uh, things over which we have make us knowledge just as God created, make us knowledge, uh, and rights of proprietorship over his creation. This idea that we are miniature God. And then we saw what happened to that idea, that work. We called it the workmanship model. We saw what had happened, what happened to it. Um, over the course of the next several centuries in particular, we saw that beginning with marks. What you get is an attempt to secularize the workmanship idea that is to say, to cut it loose from its theological moorings but still affirm the basic structure of the idea that making confers ownership. And um, we saw that Mark's, his version of that ran into trouble because he wanted to say only the worker makes things when in fact we saw the capitalist also contributes to the value of things. And then we looked at the feminist critique of marks, which was, well, yes.

Speaker 1:          32:28          And the stay at home spouse contributes to the value of what the work can makes. And indeed, even perhaps the Sunday school teacher who drum the work ethic into the worker can contributes to the value of what the word come makes and so on. So that if you have this idea that making confers ownership, you're going to get a complicated web of overlapping and indecipherable entitlements, not any clean argument of the sort that Marx's theory of exploitation aspired to be. And so, um, we, we saw that if you look at the Marxist tradition, they eventually give up on all of that. People like John Roemer and Yon Elster and Jerry Cohen. And instead just turn, they give up on the idea of workmanship and turn to an argument arguments about power. Um, but most people wouldn't find that entirely satisfying because most people do want at some level to link what we get to what we do.

Speaker 1:          33:33          People, I'm not, even if the, the notion of workmanship is problematic. Most people don't want to give it up entirely. And I think you see this very dramatically with roles because roles takes the idea of workmanship apart in a hardheaded way that nobody before him ever did. He, and this is, this is the, the debate Irie I was referring to last Wednesday about nature and nurture and moral arbitrariness. Just to remind you, there's this huge debate it's gone on for 150 years are the differences between us. The result of nature will, are they the result of nurture and roles makes the point, you know what, it doesn't matter. It doesn't make any difference because in either case, these differences are morally arbitrary. Right? Remember this? Yeah. So, um, whether I'm a good athlete because of my genes or whether I'm a good athlete because of the way I was raised is immaterial.

Speaker 1:          34:44          I did nothing to have certain genes or to be raised in a certain way. Uh, and I didn't even make choices that lead to those results. So any benefits I'd get a morally arbitrary. That was the notion, uh, that that roles, uh, brought to bear. But then the question is, well, why should anyone be entitled to what they make? And, and you know, roles is really pushed in the direction of a kind of socialization of capacities, strategy as I call it. It, that piece that I had, you read it. But it's very unsatisfying because, you know, if, if I spend five years writing a book, uh, and you come along and say, well, you're not entitled to that book. You didn't, you didn't, you don't have any special claim on the capacities. You I want to get really bad. You know, I worked really hard on that.

Speaker 1:          35:42          I wanted, it's mine. You know, who do you take it away, right? So the, so even if you can't give a good philosophical defense of this workmanship ideal, people are deeply unwilling to let go of it. Okay. Indeed. So it's raw, steeply, unwilling to let go of it. So roles and we walked through this on Wednesday, but I'll just remind you, I'm it again. Rawls makes a distinction between, um, the capacities that we have and they use, we choose to make or those capacities, but that's not very, uh, you know, the, the, the notion was so, um, if we both have the same Iq but one of us chooses to work and the artist chooses to sit on the couch watching ESPN, the one who works should get more because they chose to work. And then the person who sits on the couch should get less because they chose not to work.

Speaker 1:          36:40          Um, but that doesn't really work for roles because once you've made the move into this a land of moral arbitrary ness, the difference differences in weakness of the will are themselves distributed in morally arbitrary ways. So perhaps, uh, you know, the, the person who works all day had the work ethic drummed into them a mile a minute by some hot Sunday school teacher or very involved parent. Whereas the one who winds up sitting on the couch all day, didn't their parent, their father was, you know, off stoned all day or something when they were supposed to be being, uh, taught the work ethic. Well if the capacities themselves are morally arbitrary, then the differences in the capacity to use the capacities is so you're going to get obviously an infinite regress. So roles tries to kind of build a moat around this implication of his argument, but it doesn't work. And if you, if we had time to talk about other theorists in this tradition, you'd find the same thing.

Speaker 1:          37:51          I'll just mention the example of Ronald Dworkin whom who also liked roles has a resources to view and also like rolls sees that the differences between us, a morally arbitrary, which they are. Um, and he says, well, we should make a distinction between what he calls material resources people have, which is sort of like Rawlsian primary goods and physical and mental powers. And we should treat the differences in material resources as morally arbitrary but not the differences in physical and mental coward. But again, you have to come back and say, why not he, while we couldn't redistribute them, but actually that's not true. For instance, think about blind people. You could have a system which said, well, if some people are blind, we have to compensate them for their blindness because they have a and morally arbitrary disadvantage, right? Or indeed, if you really want it to be brutal about it, but it's nothing in the logic of what do, what can sang rules are that we should just blind all the sighted people, right? Well, maybe the technology, we get forcible, I transplant it's not a path. People are gonna want to go down, right? It's not a path. People are gonna want to go down, but it's hard to see

Speaker 2:          39:19          why not.

Speaker 1:          39:22          Right? It's hard to see why not once you take this idea of moral arbitrariness. Seriously. So two points to make about that.

Speaker 1:          39:32          We got back to the very beginning. This was never a problem for lock, right? And we should remember that because after all of this comes from Loc, uh, this workmanship model comes from Loc. Why is it not a problem? A lock? Because for lock, if we have differences in capacities, it must've been God's plan, right? Remember, lock story is human beings are God's creation. Human beings do not create other human beings. He's very clear about this in his discussion of parental rights. We don't own our children in the way that we own our property because we don't create children. God creates children and he, he, you know, he implants in, in human beings the urge to reproduce. But we can't, we don't fashion the child. We can, we can create a child in, in an architectural sense. And most importantly, of course for lock, we don't put the salt and the child.

Speaker 1:          40:36          So God does all of that. So children are God's property and parents are fight usury. So we don't own our children. So if it turns out that some of us are smarter than others, or some of us are more hard working than others and some of us are better athletes than others, we don't have to, there's no moral imperative for us to have some account of why those differences exist. Um, because they're not, they're not products of human action, that products of the divine joy. So, so in the Lockian story, this isn't a problem, but the minute you secularize the workmanship ideal, this issue arises a quiescent that some people should get more than others just because of morally arbitrary characteristics and the, um,

Speaker 1:          41:39          the, the ways in which people who have gone down this path try to not get to the end of it, aren't very Roosevelt. Right. I mentioned roles. I mentioned Dworkin. We could have looked at some others I talk about in that piece. Jerry Cohen Beer, one of them. But it doesn't work. So you're left with the fact that if you embrace the socialization of capacity strategy, you're going to get to a place that very few of us want to go to. Now it's actually even worse than that. It's even more problematic than that because everything I've said to you so far presumes that in the absence of a justification for inequality, we should presume equality off parole. I said, why should somebody get more just because they work hard? If the capacity to work, is it south, morally arbitrary, right? That presumes that, uh, there's some assumption that other things being equal, we should all get the same. But why assume that? Why assume that we could just say, wow,

Speaker 1:          43:12          it's not a divine plan. So, you know, some people are lucky and some people are lucky. There it is. Um, losses miss lie where they fall as a famous American judge, one set and gains should lie where they fall and so you could get nature. We'll hear a little bit more about nature when we read Alistair Mcintyre. Uh, next week you could get the view that you know, this strong when you know, and it just the way it is, uh, any asking moral questions about it is simply irrelevant. Now, Rawls thinks he has an answer to that, which is what I started with at the very beginning of the roles lectures, which was essentially, remember when we had the discussion of watch the fairway to cut a cake. And one of you said, wow, the fair way to cut a cake is to give the knife to the person who takes the last slice and um, then he will divided equally or she will divide it equally. Big preside machine being the person wants to maximize the slice that they get, the residual slice. So that, and the way you do that is to divide it equally.

Speaker 2:          44:28          Bye. I made

Speaker 1:          44:32          the point that that's not really an argument for equality, right? That's not a, a moral argument for equality. It's not a moral argument for equality because it assumes what we want to get is equality and then you create the, the, the mechanism to generate that result. So if for example, we added more information and we said well we know that this, the six people here waiting for the slice of cake, one of them has three cakes at home and one of them has nothing and one of them is a diabetic and one as you know, you could, as soon as you introduce information of that sort, then it's not obvious where you want to wind up is equality. And so giving them get st to the person with a knife, you get the last slice becomes problematic, right? So all of this is only to make the point that the cake cutting example does not establish the moral desirability of equality.

Speaker 1:          45:41          On the contrary, it assumes you've decided equality's where you want to end up and then you create a mechanism that generates it. And that's the structure of what roles does in his theory of justice. He assumes that his principles of where we want to end up and then he structures the choice situation to generate them. But it means if you favorite quality or if you favor efficiency or if you favor some other basis for distribution, you have to have an argument for it. Some other argument for it other than just that it gets generated in this way. And to the extent roles has any argument at all. It's this kind of prudence, this there, but for fortune go I the grave risks, um, we better take care of the person at the bottom cause it might turn out to be me. Um, but as we saw that assumes a view of risk that some people find irrationally conservative.

Speaker 1:          46:41          Um, and so we don't really have a clear clean cut answer. And so we don't really have a very satisfying evolution of the workmanship ideal from locked down through the present. It's a theological argument in locks formulation. It's got this very nice, coherent all fits together. But the moment you try to secularize it, you left with this problem that it leads into directions people are not going to want to go in on the one hand. On the other hand, they're not going to want to get rid of it entirely either. And so the ways in which people try and hedge in the parade of horribles, um, doesn't entirely work. And we're left with this kind of nagging feeling that there's gotta be some way to salvage this workmanship idea, but we haven't managed to do it. And so just as the evolution of science has taken us with the evolution of the commitment to science, it's taken us to a rather uncomfortable end point when we get to the world of political, not metaphysical.

Speaker 1:          47:57          So the evolution of the workmanship ideal has taken us to a rather uncomfortable and point once we get to roles as move and his attempt to limit the radical implications of it that he doesn't like. And so we will pick up that story when we come to talk about the democratic tradition in the last few lectures of this course. But before we get there, we're going to couldn't fit as seriously the idea that may be the whole enlightenment project was a mistake. Maybe we should reject the whole enlightenment venture. This was of course, the view of Edmund Burke Irish political thinker that we'll talk about on Wednesday. And it's, it's a, it's a long tradition from Burke down through the present. We're going to look at Alisdair Macintyre as a contemporary, uh, a defender of this view. But this is the idea that we shouldn't be surprised that the enlightenment project turns out to be untenable because it was a profound and indeed politically dangerous mistake. We'll start with that on Wednesday.
