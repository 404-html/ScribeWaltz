Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. Uh, we're going to pick up where we left off with talking about Mark's last time. And, um,

Speaker 1:          00:11          there towards the end of today's lecture, there'll be some quotations that I'm putting up on the slides to talk about. You shouldn't try and scribble them down. Uh, they're too long for that. And I put the slides up on the, on the server so you can, you can find them there. It's better to follow them. And, and the argument that I'm making, so I was just talking to some of the tea teaching fellows about how the sections went and it seemed like there was some confusion or lack of, um, what's the word? A lack of comfort with this concept of exploitation in Mark's. Just where does it come from and how does exploitation occur when people are buying, making voluntary paredo exchanges. And I think that is the right question to zero in on. And we're going to spend more time on it, uh, both today and next time because it really is important for Marxists argument to work that exploitation is not about cheating people.

Speaker 1:          01:18          It's not about getting people to do things in voluntarily. The, the idea behind the concept of exploitation is equivalent, is it changed for equivalent use values a voluntarily exchange. So another way of putting it, it if you like, is that, um, the transaction between the employer and the worker is a parade. Oh, superior transaction and marks is not claiming that it isn't. So then you might say, well, what is this idea of exploitation? And we saw that in some ways it's quite counter intuitive because, um, when we, when we worked through this, uh, the only way in which the capitalist can increase his productivity is by either increases in what Marx called absolute surplus value, which is basically lengthening the working day, getting people to work harder. They're obviously physical limits to that. And political limits workers are going to organize, they're going to get the 10 hours bell passed through parliament as they indeed dead. Um, and so then you get, um, the, the other approach, what he called increases in relative surplus value, which is technological innovation so that the capitalists can cover his wage bill in less time. And so this, the, the

Speaker 2:          02:45          okay

Speaker 1:          02:47          necessary labor time goes from four hours to three and there's um, seven hours of surplus labor time where the workers producing goods that when sold produce value that does not accrue to them. Okay. We thought there was, there was some in coward counterintuitive here and we're going to come back to that in that most of you figured you would choose three over Cho if the alternative, if you had to take one of them, but that's actually a higher rate of exploitation. Uh, and I started talking about the assumptions about how people compare themselves. Remember the self referential versus other referential and we'll come back to all of that. Um, but the point I want to make first and to get you just clearly to understand is that this, these, this kind of move increasing productivity by technological innovation is marks and modern economists all agree is the thing that makes capitalism dynamically productive because it's, it's the, it's the pressure to innovate that is created by a capitalist competition that leads to technological innovation and more and more, um, more and more capital intensive production.

Speaker 1:          04:19          Because if you think about it, the more you're spending on PR on technology to make your labor more productive, the less you're spending on your wage bill and it's only living human labor power that creates fresh value according to Marx, and so what we were, when we think about this line moving this way, we thinking about production becoming evermore capital intensive, right? More and more spent on technology to make the pro, the the workers more productive and we should expect capital in a capital intensity to increase over time. When you see Mark's talk about used phrases like the organic composition of capital increases, he's just saying that that productions becomes steadily more capital intensive. Now you could say, well, why is this exploitation and Mark's once to say this is, I think at the end of the day, not a very plausible argument for reasons we'll see on Wednesday.

Speaker 1:          05:25          He wants to say, this is not a moral argument. This is not a normative argument. He's jumped. He's using it as a technical term. And so the fact that people don't feel more exploited in this circumstance then in this is neither here nor there. It's, it's true in the class in itself since that I talked about last time, that they objectively speaking, are more exploited. He has an argument about why they will eventually come to feel more exploited. That will attend to a little bit later today. But for right now, um, he's just wants to say this is an object of argument. Now you could say, well, so is the rate of exploitation the rate of profit?

Speaker 1:          06:12          And the answer is no, it's not the right of profit because this, the value that's created here, the song called variable capitol, which just covers the wage bell, is separated out from capitol that's spent on everything else. So it's true that the capitalists profit comes out of here, but, but so rant, uh, research and development costs, advertising, mail, you name it. So profit is some subset of this, but not the totality of it. So the rate of profit is not the same thing as the rate of surplus value. And the right of profit is also not the same as the rate of exploitation. But what did he is assuming in the concept of exploitation is that the worker is producing some value that ultimately accrues to the capitalist. Now I said to you when we started out talking about marks that he just liked the neo classical theorists.

Speaker 1:          07:15          He has a micro theory and a macro theory. You now know what the micro theory is. It's this story here. You might think about it. This diagram is to marks what the parade, oh diagram is to the parade. Oh system. This is the micro story of exploitation in the same way that the predo system is the micro theory of market exchanges, but at the end of the day, of course it's this a macro theory as well. As I said, marks like Adam Smith and David Ricardo before him had an invisible hand theory and the, I think the easiest way to get a grip on his macro theory is to talk about the five sources of crisis in capitalist systems that he thought followed from his analytical logic. And I'm just gonna spell them all out now. Um, none of them is without its problems and we'll come back to the problems, uh, later today and mostly on Wednesday. But I think it's better first to see the argument in its totality before we start, uh, dismembering it and see what, what, uh, survives and what doesn't survive plus or critical scrutiny. So in the first instance,

Speaker 1:          08:40          one of the possible sources of crisis is the existence of money. Now, money from Marx is a commodity. Like anything else. This is of course before the era of paper money and anything like that. So money is gold or silver or something like that. And it's, it's a commodity like any other commodity. Um, it's, value is determined by the cost of producing it. So gold is valuable because it takes a lot of work to dig it up basically. Right? And to refine it. Um, obviously for a commodity to function as money, it's got to have certain properties. It's got to be easily divisible. And you know, we use cheap [inaudible] kind of hard because you know, if you want to use, you know, the one, one leg of a sheep, uh, to represent a three bottles of wine, they have to kill the sheep, wouldn't be very convenient.

Speaker 1:          09:35          So money has to be easily divisible and not, um, not atrophy and things like that. But apart from the, those are its properties as a use fattier if unite, but as, as an exchangeable commodity. It's like anything else. But once you get to develop market system, it depends on money to function. And this, the ever present possibility of liquidity crises. If people start hoarding money and he thinks that in times of anxiety and so on, people will start to hoard money. We saw this, uh, uh, if you remember during the financial crisis last year, whereas suddenly Manx that had trusted one another for decades and even centuries, stop trusting one another and wouldn't lend money at one money to one another in ways that they regularly did because they didn't know whether the other party had the money to lend. And there was a period of several weeks where the entire financial system was in danger of crashing simply from the liquidity crisis that sort of was perched on top of the credit crisis. So once the system becomes completely dependent on money, uh, as a medium of exchange, there's the ever present possibility that people will hoard money and um, the system will go into a crisis.

Speaker 1:          11:05          Secondly, Mark's thinks he's now understood better than Smith and Ricardo before him. Just why it is that there's a declining tendency in the rate of profit in capitalist systems and the, and the answer is in the, in the logic of the system you've already worked your way through. So if we, if you go back to here as we move down here to make the system more capital intensive, any given move increases profitability for the person who makes it. So if this is the status quo and it's a cotton factory and the capitalists puts in his spinning Jenny and makes, um, makes his wage belt more quickly than anybody else, that leads him to be able to undercut his competitor. Right? And so his profits will go up, but all the competitors all then themselves make exactly the same innovation themselves. And then once once you have spinning jennies throughout the cotton industry, the claim is that the rate of profit in the cotton industry will be lower than before anybody had put in a spinning Jenny.

Speaker 1:          12:35          Okay. So that the idea is what you do at the margin to improve your profits as a capitalist leads to the declining rate of profit in the industry as a whole. Because um, as we become more and more capital intensive in the production of cotton, we have less, less living human labor power going into the production of cotton and it's only living human labor power that produces fresh value. Now you might type, it doesn't, the Spinning Jenny produce fresh value Marxist argument is no, the value of the spinning Jenny was determined by the Labor to produce the spinning Jenny and its value is transferred to the product. But that's all. It doesn't produce new value. It's only the living human labor power. And the way you need to think about it is that that is less and less and less of the capitalists investment as a proportion of his total investment.

Speaker 1:          13:35          So living human labor power or variable capitol as Marx calls it is diminishing proportion of what the capitalist has to invest in order to remain competitive. And so overtime profits are going to diminish in very competitive industries because they'll get more and more productive. And that's what we mean in the modern world when we say there's a very, very little margin in a particular industry, you want to go into making something like salad dressing, very saturated market where every Gizmo has been tried, you're going to find miniscule margins. Uh, very, very hard. And Mark's thinks this is a process going on economy wide. And so that's why economy wide, the rate of profit gradually declines in capitalist systems. And as I said, that's something that all of the classical economists thought that they had observed. And so any theory worth it's name was going to have to account for it. So that, that's the second source of crisis though. Because as it becomes harder and harder for capitalists to make a profit, many of them are going to go out of business. And that brings me to the third source of crises in capitalist systems. And it's basically that competition eliminates competitors.

Speaker 1:          15:10          So that the initial market market model he starts with is a perfectly competitive one. But what he's saying is, of course over time, as people go out of business, at the same time as things are becoming more and more and more capital intensive, the and other way of putting it, it's the entry costs become very high. For instance, in 1984, when the challenger blew up, um, there was a company called Morton Thiokol making that made the o rings for the Challenger, right on the rocket boosters. It turned out that the design was faulty. Now you might say, well that was probably the end of Morton Thiokol calls relationship with NASA having, you know, made such a terrible error. They would go to a competitor. But guess why Morton Thiokol is still making rocket boosters for NASA. Because you know, the notion that, um, I would say to myself, hmm, looks like a good business for me to get into there.

Speaker 1:          16:19          Obviously no good at it. I'll go start making rocket boosters for NASA is laughable, right? Because the entry costs are so high. So that's an example, pretty much of an op monopolistic industry. So competition leads to innovation. Yes, but it also leads to the elimination of competitors as production becomes more and more capital intensive. And once you don't have competitors, you don't have a reason to innovate. And the basic dynamic of capitalism starts to slow down because monopoly capitalism doesn't have the same end belt incentives for innovation. Remember, the capitalist is not afraid of the worker on Mark's a story that capitalist is afraid of the capitol capitalist down the street. And once there is no capitalists down the street about to take his business away or her business away, then um, this competitive dynamic starts to atrophy. So that's a third source of crisis as far as he is concerned. A fourth source of crisis that Mark's identifies. And here he's pretty much actually following Adam Smith. The way you can think about it most straight forwardly is the worker's collectively, if they pulled all of their wages, couldn't buy what they produce.

Speaker 2:          17:53          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:54          The work has collectively can buy what they produce. And that being the case, this is going to be an endemic problem of weak demand in capitalist economies. There's not going to be enough the man to satisfy. There's not going to be enough demand to satisfy the needs of the system in order, in order for everything that's produced to get Saul big problem. You could say, well, doesn't that just mean wages will rise and then date it does put some upward pressure on wages. But as we said, you know, wages are basically going to be held around, consists a subsistence by unemployment. And so there's not much scope for that, right? Because if, if wages start to rise, um, you're, you're then gonna have the problem that, uh,

Speaker 1:          18:58          any capitalist who's not in the system will or would be capitalists to want to be capitalist. It's going to come in a Ron unemployed workers to work for him or her. And so drive wages down. So this is a problem. It's, it's one of the, it's why Adam Smith's sought you got imperialism, uh, and indeed Marx and Lenin after him all thought, one of the reasons you get imperialism is to find markets for the goods that are produced. There were other reasons too, cheap resources and so on. But one of the reasons is the search for new markets, more demand. Um, but that's a process which has obvious limits because eventually you kind of, you know, your empire is going to bump into the French empire in a Belgian empire and the German Empire, and you're gonna fill up the world and then what do you do? So you can stave it off with imperialism.

Speaker 1:          19:50          But the basic underlying problem is that the work has collectively cannot buy what they produce. Now we see this sort of dynamic play out in some ways during recessions when there's not enough demand in the economy. And of course, there are things you can do about it, can do what we did in the Great Depression. The government can borrow money and give it to, um, basically give it to unemployed people by hiring them to do public works and then they spend it and stimulate demand. Um, or they can try. We've been trying to do in the last year and a half, they can try and get the banks to give credit to people to buy things and stimulate demand. Um, but it's a basic structural problem marks things built into the very fact, uh, of, uh, that the built into the system by the very fact that the work has collectively cannot produce, cannot purchase everything that they produce.

Speaker 2:          20:59          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:01          Now you could say, well these are all sort of tendencies, but there are counter tendencies as well and these problems can be staved off imperialism being an example of staving off the one I've just discussed and marks is not particularly clear on just which one of these problems is supposed to be decisive. Rather, what he thinks is they'll all sort of kick in and start to make the system creek and creek at the joints and not work very well. And as that starts to happen, workers will start to get mad because they will start to discover that the system isn't giving them any particular benefits. The famous line towards the end of the communist manifesto that you are red workers will come to realize that they have nothing to lose, but the chains, the system that has given them certain benefits, we'll give them fewer and fewer benefits.

Speaker 1:          22:04          As competition becomes more cut throat. Uh, their employers are working with narrow or narrow margins. Um, they, they're unable to buy the huge, the, the, the luxury goods that they see all around them. And so they'll start to become angry. And that leads us to the discussion we had last time where, um, we, we, we see that Mark's wants to say that the declining relative share of the total product is eventually going to make them militant. And so the image is office of a system becoming less and less dynamic. The smaller and smaller number of monopolies in every industry. Capitalists who are going out of business, falling down into the working class, bringing all their resentments with them. And finally, uh, the system starts to reach the point where it just can't function. And that's when he thanks. The social socialist revolution becomes both possible and necessary. And so you will get some sort of revolutionary moment and the workers, um, we'll take over the state and the small remaining number of monopoly capitalist will be put out of business. Uh, the means of production will be nationalized and then, uh, socialism will exist.

Speaker 1:          23:36          So that's the story that he's telling. Now I want to zero in on a few features of socialism and communism, uh, before we, and then we'll come back and talk about the difficulties with this argument. Socialism for Marx is not an equilibrium anymore than capitalism is. Socialism is not a system that is without its own internal contradictions according to Marx. And the reason is as he says, yeah, we have to deal with is a communist society. Not as it's developed on its own foundations, but on the contrary, just as it emerges from a capitalist society, which is that's in every respect, economically, morally and intellectually still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from who's worm. It emerges accordingly. The individual producer, this is now, he's talking about after a socialist revolution producers, the individual producer receives back from society after the deductions that have been made exactly what he gives to it.

Speaker 2:          24:45          Okay,

Speaker 1:          24:45          so in other way you might put this as workmanship is no longer hypocritical under socialism, the work I really gets back what he's put in, he receives a certificate from society that is furnished, such and such an amount of labor. Often deducting is labor for the common funds and with this certificate he draws from the social stock of mean the of means of consumption as much as the same amount of labor cost, as much as the same amount of labor costs. So you, so you have what he, what he describes, he has the rights that workers get to what they've produced. He says it's still in principle a bourgeois, right. Although in principle and practice on no longer at loggerheads, while the exchange of equivalence in commodity exchange exists only on the average and not in the individual video case. Don't worry about that last phrase, but what he's saying here is that principle and in practice are no longer at loggerheads. What he means is the worker is being recompensed for his work,

Speaker 2:          26:00          right?

Speaker 1:          26:06          Whereas under capitalism, the worker appears to be being Rican recompensed for his work, but in fact some of what he produces is accruing to the capitalists. So that's the difference. Principle and practice are at loggerheads on to capitalism. It professors, the idea that we're entitled to what we make. Whereas under socialism we in fact do get what we made

Speaker 1:          26:33          and, and then that sense socialism is advanced an advanced on capitalism, but he says in spite of this advance, the equal rights is still constantly stigmatized as a Bush Walker limitation. The right of the producers is proportional to the labor they supply and the equality. It consists in the fact that that that measurement is made with an equal standard labor. Now what does all that mean? Ah, it's rather contorted language, but just look at a little more of the contorted language and then I'll explain in words of one syllable what it means. This is from, uh, the critique of the Goethe, the program. And what he wants to say is even if you reward people equally, even if you reward people equally for their work, there's going to be inequality in the society. So he says, look, one man is superior to another, physically or mentally and supplies more labor at the same time, works harder or can labor for a longer time and labor to serve as a measure must be defined by it's duration or intensity.

Speaker 1:          27:45          Otherwise, it ceases to be a standard of measurement. This equal rights is an unequal, right for unequal labor. So if some of us are stronger than others and we get paid according to how much work we do, some of us are going to get more than others. Right and equal right to an equal labor. It recognizes no class differences because everyone is now only a worker like everyone else. Once we get to socialism, but it tacitly rescue recognizes I need equal individual endowments. It passively recognizes unequal individually endowments and that's productive capacity as a natural privilege. It is therefore a right of inequality and it's content light. Every other right, right by its very nature can consist only in the application of an equal standard but unequal individuals. And they would not be different individuals if they were not unequal. A measurable only by an equal standard insofar as they're brought under an equal point of view, uh, taken from one definite side only for instance, in the present case or regarding only as work and as as nothing more is seen in them.

Speaker 1:          28:59          Everything else being ignored further, one worker is married, another is not, one has children, more children than another and so on and so forth. Thus with an equal performance of labor and Henson and equal in the social consumption fund, one will in fact received more than another one will be richer than another and so on. So if you think about a system in which there's no longer a capitalist but people are rewarded on the basis of work, there's still going to be an equality because some people have more effective capacities to work than others and because some have diff have more demands on them than others. If you have more children to feed than somebody else, earning the same amount is going to leave you relatively worse off. So socialism is not a condition of equality because there is this right based upon labor and he says these defects are inevitable and the first phase of a communist society, which is socialism, they're inevitable

Speaker 1:          30:14          as it as it is when it is just emerged off the block. Prolong Birth Cat Pang from capitalist society right, can never be higher than the economic structure of society and its cultural development condition. Their buy in a higher phase of communist society after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor. And there with also the antithesis between mental and physical Labor has vanished after Labor has become not only a means of life, but life's prime. One after the productive forces have increased with the all round development of the individual and the springs of cooperative wealth law more abundantly, only then can the narrow horizon and a bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety. And Society subscribe on its banners from each according to his ability to each according to his needs, from each according to his ability to each according to his needs. That is the definition of the distributor principle under communism. Whereas under socialism, it's from each according to his ability to each according to his work.

Speaker 1:          31:32          So socialism is not hypocritical with respect to the the workmanship ideal because unlike capitalism, the workers getting rewarded for their work, but it's still an unequal society because people are differently abled and people have different demands to meet. Uh, and so finally we have to get to the abolition of the very idea of rights in order to get to the communist idea of from each according to his ability to each according to his need. So that's the Marxian story. I'm sorry I put such long quotations up there, but I think you, you need them to get a flavor of how he was actually thinking about it. Th the, these interaction crises, all of them making one another worst declining profits, a liquidity crisis, more and more militant workers, um, and, and so on and so forth. Finally, you get an increase in consciousness. The socialists takeover. It's still an unequal system, but it has the capacity for super abundance, for cooperative wealth to flow more abundantly. And so we can abolish the idea of right completely and just distribute on the basis of needs.

Speaker 3:          32:53          Now

Speaker 1:          32:56          I want to start digging into this in a critical way, um, to show you all of the things that are wrong with it. But this is in the spirit of how we treated utilitarianism. Uh, that is to say we're going to see all of the things that are wrong with his argument in the same way that we did with Bentham and mill in order then to see if there's any surviving intuition. And I want to start with this concept of needs. One of the reasons Marx and his followers, we're so focused on needs was that they were convinced that in order to keep itself going, capitalism, manufacturers pseudo wants all the time. We already saw this, this problem. You know, there's this problem with insufficient demand. You've got to get people to want things. You've got to get people to believe, you know, if you don't have the latest, whatever it is, you're a schmuck.

Speaker 3:          34:09          Uh, you know,

Speaker 1:          34:11          my son, you know, looks at my blackberry tour and he says, how can you use a phone like that? Nobody uses those anymore. You've got to have a Google phone, right? And if you don't have a Google phone, you're just a complete loser. That's his view of the matter. Uh, and because there's this problem, weak demand, this is built in emphasis to constantly manufacturer demand fourth and things that nobody needs. But the impulse to create all of these, these phony needs will go away. Why don't you don't need capitalism to innovate? So why don't you don't have capitalism. You don't need people to constantly think that they have to have the latest Gizmo. You don't need to try and get people to think, you know, of the, of the 27 kinds of, um, dishwashing liquid in stop and shop. This one's better than that one. Um, all of these manufactured artificial needs are an artifact of the problem that we have to keep capitalism going. And once that goes away, we can think about people having finite needs. And so if society late reaches a certain level of abundance, then those needs can be met.

Speaker 1:          35:35          Who thinks that's a terrible argument? Okay. What's bad about it? Take, take the, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          35:48          It just doesn't seem like a good model of human nature puts a limit on how much you can want it. What it puts a limit on how much you can want. And it makes, it seems like everyone has to want the same amount of things.

Speaker 1:          36:01          Okay. Why else? That I think that was a good point. What else is wrong with it? I mean, it is surely it's true that some of the things, you know, there is a difference between wants and needs. Right? And a lot of our wants are very frivolous, right? You're not, you, there are a lot of things do we want, I mean the neoclassical system doesn't differentiate because it's all, we don't allow interpersonal judgments of utility, right? So, uh, you know, Trump thinks that he needs the next $100 million and you might say he might, he might want it, but he doesn't need it. But what's wrong with, you know, I'm just wanting you to elaborate on what he was saying. Well, somebody else to elaborate on, on what she was saying. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          36:55          no.

Speaker 4:          36:56          How the government will decide what people need and what they just want.

Speaker 1:          37:01          You're, you're, you're troubled by the idea of that government deciding what people will need and want. They just want, I think that's fair enough. But you know, I think Marx and his most utopian moments after all, one of the differences between social zone communism is there is no government under communism is a withering away of the state. So his idea I think, is this just going to be all the super, these, you know, all these goodies. Every people, we'll just take what they need.

Speaker 4:          37:29          Where does the abundance come from also? That's another problem.

Speaker 1:          37:33          Where is it? It's been made possible by capitalism. The they, the productivity of cap,

Speaker 4:          37:39          it gets used up and then there is no more capitalism to create more.

Speaker 1:          37:45          Okay. So you're saying it'll, we might go to super abundance but then go fall back from it. So, uh, yeah, those, those, uh, I think those are good criticism. So why will there be continuing abundance? I think that's a fair criticism. Um, but I think there's a more fundamental problem with it and that is in distinguishing wants from needs. You could say luck, you know, even before you get to those problems, which you both raise serious questions for it. But even before you get to those question, somebody might say, look, we can at least define needs by what people require in order to survive. Surely if we want

Speaker 2:          38:35          to distinguish one's from needs, we, we make a distinction between things that if you don't get them, you're going to die versus things that if you don't get them, you might not be that happy, but you're not going to die. What about that? Is that, who thinks that that would solve Marxists problem? Anybody?

Speaker 1:          38:59          Why wouldn't it? Who thinks it wouldn't? You just said, you know, we've got to reach a level of productivity where we can produce what people in need in order to survive and then we could get rid of the regime of rights. And you know, he, I think Mark's makes a very valid point when he says any regime of riots is a regime of inequality. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          39:25          Well I think there's kind of keeping with the same thing they had during, um, capitalism. Like if it's still just subsistence level, if that's what you need. And that's the same thing the workers had under capitalism is not really making the communism a better society for the people.

Speaker 1:          39:41          Okay. So you're saying, oh, a world in which people only meet their needs may not be a better world. Yeah. Okay. I think that might be a fact, a fair criticism. He wants to say the alternative is that we're all like these rats on wheels running faster and faster to get, um, you know, less and less benefit. So the, that and last we can accept finitude that, you know, we, we live for a fixed time and, and uh, we, we, if we, if we can't come to grips with the fact that, um, we are finite creatures, we're never going to be happy. So I think that's the debate that he would want to have with you. But I think that that even within Marx's own terms of reference, this a, this a different problem and that that is this. Suppose you said, all right. We all grant you as a matter of the philosophy on it.

Speaker 1:          40:41          We'll grant you the proposition. We'll grant you call marks the proposition that needs are defined by what is necessary for people's survival and that they, they should somehow be more important than and Trump frivolous once that might make life better. But still, you know, still an all making my life better by letting me have a nice car is less important than preventing somebody from starving when it really gets down to it. And so we could make this distinction between needs and wants in that sense. But here's the problem. Even if we're only trying to meet people's needs defined in that narrow sense of keeping people alive, there's still and Damick scarcity. This notion of super abundance doesn't make any sense. Just think about it for a minute. Money that we spend on dialysis machines is money that we don't spend on heart transplants or aids research. So no matter what, no matter how much wealth there is this still distributed choices to make and this society, there's still gonna be the problem that we're going to say, wow,

Speaker 1:          42:15          if we choose to to to protect needs a, B, and c that need anyone who needs dialysis should get free dialysis. Then in, you know, whether we make it explicit or implicit beside the point, somebody who needs something else to keep them alive is not going to get it. We're not going to do research on cancer because we are doing spending that next marginal dollar doing research on um, the causes of AIDS. Um, so why, why don't you see that point then the notion of super abundance becomes incoherent. There is no such thing as super abundance and without super abundance, you can't get a world beyond entitlements, right? But it explicit or implicit, you're never going to transcend the world of scarcity. Why don't you see that that meeting needs even defined in this minimal way of what's necessary to keep people alive re involves trade offs. What you're really saying is that scarcity is endemic to the human condition. And this is the deepest analytical floor in Marx's normative theory. Because once you say that scarcity is endemic to the human condition, you can't get away from distributor of conflict. You've got to find some way, whether it's a system of rights, whether it's the market, where it's the government making decisions about who needs what, um, somebody or some mechanism is gonna make those decisions, right? So you reach the proposition that scarcity is endemic to the human condition and you have to reason about what makes sense. Taking that for granted.

Speaker 1:          44:17          Anyway, it's ironic that Marx was so blind to this because Mark's was the person who said human nature is not static and evolves through history. We develop and change. Um, and so you would think he of all people would see that the, the fact that, you know, in 1886, the natural life expectancy was whatever it was, 46 years. Why that shouldn't be taken as a given or the biblical three score years and 10 be taken as a given for that matter. Um, but you will never reach a condition in which scarcity can be transcended. And that's the ultimate hope behind his utopianism. So it's not that I disagree with any of the points you folks made. I think they're all correct. The other, there are other reasons that you would question it, but the reason this particular, uh, argument, I think cuts at the roots of his theory is that it's the most favorable interpretation of his account of needs, right?

Speaker 1:          45:24          There's no more favorable interpretation than limiting them to survival. And even on that account, we can't, we can't get to a world of super abundance. We will always live in a world of scarcity. And that means that whatever you have to say about distribution has to take that for granted. This is, this is as I think, as powerful at point as the point we made when we came to the end of our discussion of mill to the effect that you can't get the politics out of the definition of harm, right? There's no neutral way to define harm. Uh, another way of thinking about this is it's a way of trying to transcend politics, right? One of angles, not marks, but nevermind, uh, angles was, um, stating a Marxian and view was that the, the great thing about a socialism and communism is that politics gets displaced by administration.

Speaker 1:          46:33          That you don't have to worry about distributive conflict in this story because there's super abundance, right? And in mills account, you don't have to worry about the definition of harm in his case because there'll be a neutral scientific account. Uh, neither of them works. So we have a world in which they have to be political choices about distributed questions. Some say leave it to the market, but that is itself a political choice. We'll, we'll have more to say about that. So that's the, the beginning of the end of Marxism is I think the recognition that scarcity is endemic to the human condition. Um, what we will do on Wednesday is explore and unpack some other difficulties with his argument and then see where the, and what the remaining insights might be. See you then.
