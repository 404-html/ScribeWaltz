Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. So let's begin. I asked you to, to bear two questions in mind in reading the Eichmann.

Speaker 2:          00:13          MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:14          And I'm going to get to those in a minute, but before we get to that, who, who was ad off? Eichmann

Speaker 2:          00:24          okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24          Who was that? Oh, fuck man.

Speaker 2:          00:26          Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:29          You're going to have to get, get a, a microphone.

Speaker 2:          00:32          Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:40          He was the expert on Jewish immigration and relocation,

Speaker 1:          00:45          but why was his job, what was he, what was his Chinese, what was he there to do?

Speaker 2:          00:49          Um Hm.

Speaker 3:          00:51          Well, in the beginning he was sent to talk to the Jewish elder council and try to negotiate, um, the moving of thousands of Jewish people as quickly as possible from different areas

Speaker 1:          01:03          throughout Europe. Correct. What else was he supposed to do? Why don't you give somebody else a chance that, that was certainly part of what he was doing. What else was he supposed to do?

Speaker 1:          01:16          What's he, was he somebody, was he somebody who was involved in designing the final solution as it was called in? The third way was, was he a policymaker? April is shaking their heads. No, he wasn't. He was basically an implementer, right? He was, he was obeying orders and his job was to make the trains run on time, literally speaking their trains that were going to, um, take Jews to concentration camps or was it complicated logistical feat and he was in charge of it. His job was to make sure, uh, that it was an efficiently run operation. Um, as I said at the end of the war, he was actually captured by the allied forces, but they didn't realize what a significant figure he was. He was subsequently released, inadvertently made his way to Latin America where he lived on the cover until the Mossad found out where he was. And then in 1960, they kidnapped him, brought him to Israel where he was tried. In the trial that you read about in this book, uh, for debt today, found guilty of crimes are grants to the Jewish people and crimes against humanity and put to death.

Speaker 2:          02:42          MMM,

Speaker 1:          02:45          okay. What kind of a person was he? What do you think motivated him when you read, you read this, what kind of a person? What's, what stood out about him? Anybody?

Speaker 2:          03:05          Okay.

Speaker 4:          03:06          It seemed throughout the, uh, throughout the text that he was driven by this idea of self advancement. The need for, uh,

Speaker 1:          03:12          he wanted to, he wanted to get ahead. Yeah. He wanted to impress his superiors. Yeah. First and foremost, I believe he wanted to get an a right. Pretty much, yes. What he was that, that's one thing that strikes you about him. Yeah. What else struck you about him?

Speaker 4:          03:29          Uh, the thoughtlessness that he demonstrated throughout the camp. They what? Sorry. Thoughtlessness just kind of the blind obedience to the first word.

Speaker 1:          03:38          If he wants to be moist, not our reflective man. Not at all. It's not somebody who would question authority. Right. Did you get the impression he hated Jews? No. No. What makes you say that?

Speaker 4:          03:52          Uh, I mean, full first during his testimony, he claimed that he didn't hate Jews. Uh, he actually was a supporter of the Zionist movement, uh, through the, some of the readings that he did before 1939. And, uh, throughout even the years between 1939, 1945, when he was carrying out all these actions that were detrimental to the Jewish people, he found himself having Jewish friends, working with the Jewish people, trying to find solutions. But as long as that didn't contradict the orders of his superiors,

Speaker 1:          04:26          I think you've got him exactly right. He's not somebody who was not somebody motivated by a restoral antisemitism. Indeed. You get the impression reading this book that if, if his superiors had said to him, instead of shipping people to concentration camps, we want you to ship, um, munitions around the third way to resupply the army. All we want you to ship, um, car parts. He would have done it with the same, um, zeal and desire to improve his, uh, standing with his superiors. He wouldn't have been any different about it. Um, he didn't seem to be like a, somebody who, who saw this as a great opportunity to do something he really believed in. He was simply trying to get an a China get ahead, trying to impress his superiors, do it good and efficient job at whatever it was that he was asked to do. Um, is that if that, if that's an accurate description about him, it's quite chilling. Right. And I think this brings us to the first question. What is it that makes you uncomfortable about this

Speaker 2:          05:47          man?

Speaker 1:          05:52          One of the things I asked you to think about, what makes you uncomfortable about Eichmann?

Speaker 2:          06:01          Yeah.

Speaker 5:          06:05          The fact that he was just, um, basically not thinking about what he was doing. So someone else had total control of what he was going to do.

Speaker 1:          06:13          So he has his own reflectiveness is what makes you uncomfortable.

Speaker 5:          06:17          Right. Cause that means really anyone can be like that. It kind of makes you reflect on yourself and not just on human nature.

Speaker 1:          06:24          Okay. So you, you feel he should have been questioning the, the, uh, the authorities that were giving him the orders to do this? Yeah, that'd be nice. Okay. That's definitely one thing that makes people uncomfortable. What else? Anybody else?

Speaker 2:          06:44          Yeah.

Speaker 5:          06:49          Um, it was just that his on reflectiveness transferred to the fact that, uh, well, you know, he wanted to do his job well, but the fact was that he wasn't just transporting munitions. These were people's lives. Uh, supposedly people he easily could have been friends with.

Speaker 1:          07:08          Right. He Wa he wasn't thinking about the larger purpose. Um, so it's, it's connected to the on reflectiveness, although we'll see that one of the themes in this course that political theorist write about is the whole idea of detaching means from ends of thinking about how to do things efficiently without reference to what it is that we are doing. But it makes us uncomfortable. What else makes you uncomfortable about this man? What makes you, what makes your skin crawl when you think about him? Anything else? Yeah, let's get the microphone.

Speaker 3:          07:54          He was gloating like when he was in Argentina and he was doing his interviews, he was gloating about the millions of people that had died because of him, because of his work.

Speaker 1:          08:03          He was pleased that he had done a good job. Yeah. It wasn't as if he was doing this with any sense of reluctance. Right. He was doing it with even, even though you don't get the sense that this man had a visceral antisemitism about him, he certainly was pleased with the fact that his superiors like what he was doing and that, uh, he was being commended for it and he was, um,

Speaker 2:          08:29          uh, getting ahead.

Speaker 1:          08:34          Anything, anything else that makes you uncomfortable about him?

Speaker 2:          08:42          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          08:48          he brings up the term idealist and he sort of, um, attaches a sense of honor and loyalty to the Third Reich that we find uncomfortable

Speaker 1:          08:56          because of what it's trying to call to, to his superiors that he thought it was important to a by his superiors. Okay. Uh, anybody at somebody over there? I was going to say, yeah, over there.

Speaker 6:          09:13          Um, well it's not something specific about his actions, but I'm uncomfortable with the fact that one, he is constantly normal by all the tests. And two, he, when he wasn't thinking at all, he actually saw, he was thinking and he filled it. All the people when you get into thinking that he's smart and competent, so it makes you wonder if that's the stupidity is just something, was he all of us?

Speaker 1:          09:30          Yup. I think that's right as well. So here you have a man who is completely unreflective about what he's doing. He's a bang orders from above. He's not breaking the law right at all into implementing the law as it, as it's enacted in the Third Reich. And he's going about something that is absolutely monstrous with calm efficiency and good humor, uh, and going home. Uh, you could imagine this guy going home at the end of the week playing with children, uh, being friends with the neighbors, going to a barbecue and going back to work the next day. All right. It's, uh, one of our ranch raises to capture this. Is that one of the things that seems so chilling about this guys that he doesn't seem like a monster. He seems like the man next door and the, and this, the phrase she uses is the banality of evil. He doesn't seem like, uh, um,

Speaker 2:          10:35          okay.

Speaker 1:          10:35          Somebody who's got some, uh, unusual trait. So it, I think, you know, to push to turn the screw a little bit further, one of the things that makes people uncomfortable with a man like this is sort of makes you wonder how would you have behaved in his situation? You know, you hope you would have not behaved as he did, but he doesn't seem that unusual. He seems completely unremarkable, man. Fairly typical a guy, uh, doing what he's, you know, putting one foot in front of the other, in, in, in the situation in which he finds himself and getting on with his life. Um, and that I think is captured by her phrase, the banality of evil. Um, okay. Let's now just put Eifman to one side for a minute and think about the second question I asked you to reflect upon while reading this. What two things make you most uncomfortable about around, about the events surrounding Eichmann's apprehension, trial and execution. First of all, this, why did Israel do what it did? Why do you think they went and came dot him?

Speaker 2:          12:01          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:02          Mean the normal process, you know, if, if you,

Speaker 7:          12:06          mmm.

Speaker 1:          12:09          If you're trying to get hold of a criminal and in other countries you, you go and you apply for extradition and he'd come the, you make the case and you go to court and the person is arrested and, and uh, eventually they brought that brought to trial.

Speaker 7:          12:25          MMM.

Speaker 1:          12:26          So why didn't they do that? Why did they do what they did? Anybody either no one to take a guess. Why did they do that? Anyone want to try that? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          12:43          Well, it seems to imply that they might have been concerned or might've suspected other countries wouldn't be sympathetic to their wish to try it. Okay. They might have worried that he'd Garner a certain amount of international support or, or defense,

Speaker 1:          13:00          sorry, I'm sorry guys living in. I think that's right. If they tried to extradite him, it, it wouldn't have worked as soon as he, he knew there were many other former Nazis in Argentina and elsewhere in Latin America. Uh, the minute he realized that they, they knew where he was and who he was, he would have gone on to ground and vanished. And, uh, they would have been so much sand in the we all stuff the extradition system that uh, they made a judgment, which is probably a valid judgment that if they were going to get them at all, this was the way they were going to get him.

Speaker 7:          13:34          MMM.

Speaker 1:          13:36          So that's why they did it pretty much. That's why they did it.

Speaker 7:          13:41          MMM.

Speaker 1:          13:42          Okay. So given that, that's why they did it, what, if anything makes you uncomfortable about what, what they did over here? We need to mine.

Speaker 2:          13:55          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          14:00          In one of the last two chapters, I believe they're discussing the reasons for judgment against him in on all the accounts. And one of them will, she's discussing the four main points that they attempt to prove through the prosecution and Indian in some of them they discuss the term in Doobie au contraire rule on, which is I guess when in doubt act against the defendant. And that was kind of just when we don't have necessarily all of the evidence because a lot of it is speculative, we will act in a way that will,

Speaker 1:          14:31          okay. So there, there was not a lot of attention to the rules of evidence. Yeah. Right. Okay. So that's one thing that there were a lot of what it, what we would think of as procedural irregularities and this trial. Uh, yeah.

Speaker 2:          14:49          Yeah.

Speaker 8:          14:50          I was uncomfortable with the speed of the execution. It happened, uh, extremely soon after his appeal and plea for mercy within a couple hours.

Speaker 1:          14:59          Right. He was, it was, it was the way expectations at done in China today, not the way executions at done in the United States today. Right. He was, it was very rapid. And why, why were you uncomfortable with that?

Speaker 8:          15:15          I think there's no doubt that what he did was wrong, but you at least have to, uh, go through the procedures just to ensure that justice is actually served so that even if it was correct that they should have, you know, that he deserved the death penalty. Um, I think the actual, the protocol should have been followed in that, um, he should have gotten his time to make the appeal and, uh,

Speaker 1:          15:38          okay. Anything else? Make anybody uncomfortable about what was done over. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          15:47          Um, it mentioned in the beginning how shall we, the trial was, and, um, one part that I thought really stuck with me was when the author mentioned that, uh, Israel, Israel's laws itself prohibitive. Josh is Israeli law prohibited Jewish and non Jewish marriage. So how the two societies, although one is certainly worse than the other, I think on a moral level there's still no perfect society. And that really kind of was disturbing I think.

Speaker 1:          16:14          Okay. So it was something of a show trial. Yeah, it was, there was more than one agenda here I want agenda was, uh, justice bringing him to justice, but clearly there was an agenda, revenge and there was an agenda of catharsis for many of the, the, um, people who testified who came there, it was very important for them personally to get up and speak about what had happened to them for which he was held responsible. So there were multiple agendas going on here, only one of which was what we normally think office, what's going on in a criminal prosecution. Anything else? Make anybody uncomfortable? Yeah. Over here.

Speaker 9:          17:02          Um, the author had mentioned that Israel wouldn't have gone to the trouble of kidnapping him if he wasn't automatically going to be found guilty. Like they weren't, it was just a foregone conclusion from the beginning. And that's just really sending such a bad precedent for, you know, trials in general. Um, so even though it was clear he was guilty, the fact that it was just, you know, they wouldn't have even trouble troubled going through it if they thought there was any possibility of him being found innocent.

Speaker 1:          17:27          Oh, nice. So it was, it was, uh, the outcome was never in doubt. Hmm. Okay. And that makes you nervous because, hang on.

Speaker 2:          17:35          Okay.

Speaker 9:          17:36          Um, because while his cases is pretty black and white, that's just setting a precedent for the future. And if, if in a case where it's so clearly, um, he's so clearly guilty, you can't use real evidence and you can't actually go through the steps with a meaningful steps of a trial to find him guilty, then it's hard. Then it seems like in the future, other trials where it's not a black and white maybe made more into show trials as well. Like if he could clearly have been found guilty in a meaningful way with real evidence and they just kind of didn't try to do that.

Speaker 1:          18:10          Okay. Anything else? Make anyone uncomfortable? Yeah. Over here

Speaker 9:          18:17          also the lack of evidence that was eligible for procurement on this side of the defense and the lack of defense support really stuck out to me.

Speaker 1:          18:26          It didn't have what we call discovery. There was a lot of procedural irregularities here. They didn't have access to the evidence, uh, and they, they could make, there were a lot of what, you know, when you all go off to the Lord, the Lord is calling you learn criminal procedure. A few years from now there was a lot of what would be called reversible error in this trial that is on an on appeal would have run into trouble procedural problems. And so there were procedural problems in the trial. What else? Over there? Yeah.

Speaker 10:         19:02          Um, it makes me uncomfortable that Israel was even claiming jurisdiction in the case. Considering the crime did not happen on Israeli soil and that they literally had to send their secret service to kidnap him to bring him to Israeli soil.

Speaker 1:          19:18          Okay. So you're, you are travel that they thought they had jurisdiction in this matter, right, because the crime didn't happen on Israeli soil. Any other reason why one might be troubled that they claimed jurisdiction?

Speaker 10:         19:33          Um, it felt like it was the country kind of speaking for, uh, people are speaking for humanity in a way that was just unsettling to me.

Speaker 1:          19:45          Okay. Did they arrogated to themselves the right to prosecute in the name of the Jewish people and in the name of humanity, crimes against humanity, they convicted him, uh, of you might say, who appointed them to do that? Uh, I think, uh, there's a lot of, uh, a lot of truth to what you say there, but this, there are a number of other aspects to it as well. Why else might we be troubled that they thought they had jurisdiction to do this? What does jurisdiction mean anyway? What does jurisdiction?

Speaker 2:          20:22          Yeah.

Speaker 9:          20:28          Um, I think it's equally troubling that they thought that they had to do this. I mean they talked a lot about the way that former Nazis are being tried in Germany and how lenient their punishments were. I think that that is kind of the need of the German people to kind of, I don't know, kind of like twist history in that way to kind of blame

Speaker 1:          20:47          away from these people who obviously did a lot of things wrong in a way force Israel to have to kind of take this berry like drastic sort of extra legal action. Okay. But so I think you all make a now a number of valid points, but somebody wants, say, devil's advocate would say, well look, nobody's seriously alleging that he was incorrectly convicted nobody seriously alleging that he didn't do this. Uh, we've already said by assumption if that they were working on the, on the premise that if, if they did and did, if they didn't prosecute him, he wasn't going to happen at all. Um, so what's that? It be that troubled about is there, is there a counterargument to that? Yeah. Over there.

Speaker 10:         21:52          Next time it might not be so clear. Another country might use this as a place for themselves.

Speaker 1:          21:58          Press it. An issue that, um, and what are the precedents were worried about?

Speaker 2:          22:03          Okay.

Speaker 10:         22:04          Um, the precedent of claiming jurisdiction over any number of crimes that occur elsewhere. The precedent of basically kidnapping in order to have a legal system, the precedent of show trials

Speaker 1:          22:20          for serious, you know, it, it potentially a huge issue. I don't know if you noticed,

Speaker 7:          22:26          um, uh, um,

Speaker 1:          22:29          Israeli politician Livni when cans for the trip, you're Britain a few weeks ago because they discovered that, uh, some prosecutor in Britain was going to have her arrested for war crimes in Gaza. She had been foreign minister during the Gaza invasion and a year ago and the British government was very embarrassed and I tried to fix it so that that couldn't be done again. But you know, um, piano shag couldn't travel to many places because he was eventually going to be arrested. Um, there are, now, there are some countries in which their conversations about, uh, whether they might try and arrest Donald Rumsfeld if he travels to, to them. Um, for, you know, what went on at Abu Ghraib. So if a, if countries starts setting themselves up and saying, we have the right to prosecute war criminals,

Speaker 7:          23:27          mmm.

Speaker 1:          23:29          You know who, who's gotten, how's it going to be regulated, who they're going to be answerable to that. So that, those sorts of, if my, it might look okay in this case because

Speaker 7:          23:39          mmm,

Speaker 1:          23:41          we're not, you know, we, nobody seriously contends that Eifman and do these things or that they were legitimate, the justifiable. Uh, but this is precedent setting issue, uh, that you have to worry about it. Um, anything else? Anything I haven't mentioned that you might find troubling? I mean, my, my, somebody not outside luck.

Speaker 1:          24:07          This guy is big. It's not, it's not just that it Washington on Israeli soil. This guy has big prosecuted by a legal system, which they didn't even exist when he quit, when he committed his, his crimes. And furthermore, he was a bang, a legal system that did exist, right? He was, he was in Germany in the 1940s that bang, uh, the laws of the third way. He wasn't breaking any laws then. Um, and now he's being tried in a legal system and a country that didn't even exist then, um, for violating other laws. Isn't this isn't, isn't this just victus justice?

Speaker 2:          24:54          Okay.

Speaker 1:          24:56          So why don't we say about that was, was it, did they go the wrong thing? A lot of people I think would, would grant until much of that of what's been said here and still be troubled by the notion that they shouldn't have done it because you would never be brought to justice.

Speaker 1:          25:24          Okay. Now let's take a step back from this conversation and bring in what we were doing in the first half of our discussion. Don't you think there's a tension now between the two halves of our discussion? Because when we were talking about what made us uncomfortable about Eichmann, it was his, his abdicating his moral responsibility to question the prevailing law, to question the legitimacy of what he was being asked to do. His odd and reflectiveness, uh, his lack of interest in the overall goals of the enterprise. That he was part of this completely unreflective person doing what he was told to do, a bang orders, trying to produce his superiors and get ahead. That's what made us sign comfortable. But now when we talk about what Israel did in 1960, it seems like, uh, what makes you uncomfortable there is, um, the fact that they did do all of those things. They did say, they sat down and they said, well, yeah, there's international Lauren this extradition, but hey, you know what, it's not going to happen. Uh, and if, if, if we want to get the morally correct outcome here, we have to take it upon ourselves not to accept the existing rules of the game, not to accept the existing order, but to stand up for what's right.

Speaker 2:          26:57          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:57          So how is it that we, on the one hand, are uncomfortable with Ironman for failing to do that, but here we're uncomfortable when, when these Israeli, um,

Speaker 2:          27:10          okay,

Speaker 1:          27:11          commandos and prosecutors do exactly that. Is that a real contradiction or is am I missing something? Anybody want to pick up that?

Speaker 2:          27:26          What do you think?

Speaker 9:          27:32          So I, I do think it's a contradiction in very worth examining, but one sort of interesting aspect of it is just that I think part of what we object to about the trial is that it claimed to be following a certain legal order. Um, and that it sort of associated this working outside the system with a cyst. What is that legal with, with these Israeli legal system? Um, I mean with, with the judicial court system of the nation.

Speaker 1:          28:03          But didn't, you know, even that even, I mean, I, I take your point, but it's not very plausible. It's not the best defense because after all, uh, you know, as it's come up in this conversation, even by the standards of exist against regular law, this was not a great,

Speaker 9:          28:19          right. What I'm saying is it, is it this, this trial, which clearly wasn't, which clearly, you know, broke a lot of what we would consider the, the good standards for trial sort of tainted somehow the idea of the Israeli judicial system. I mean, it seems like maybe, I'm not saying this would have been better, but some of our objections wouldn't necessarily apply if it had been really obviously just like a political assassination because they didn't know what else to do with him. I mean, not that that would be acceptable either necessarily, but, um, there's just the relation to this to the courts. Okay. It's in there somehow too.

Speaker 2:          28:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:58          Okay. So that might speak to part of it, but any, anything else about this tension between, on the one hand we are worried that, that I advocated his moral autonomy and responsibility on the other hand, uh, where I'm comfortable that they asserted their ass. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         29:17          Well, I'm not really quite sure the tension I'm completely exists if we're to assume that one system of government or one system of laws is like legitimate and valid, um, like the Israeli trial system, like having a system that lets you have appeals that, um, doesn't, um, kidnap people illegally, um, versus a system kills millions of people, um, who are innocent of doing anything wrong, um, and kills him simply for who they are. Um, so Eichmann's case, it seems to me that it is legitimate to challenge him to challenge the system and to um, be shocked or disappointed when he doesn't then just goes along with it. Um, on the other hand, to bring someone like that to justice, um, it is a bit troubling that, um, when you have a system that does work, um, or that we widely believed to be a system that, um, like a, a judicial system that does work and is sort of widely accepted to be a good system. Um, setting a precedent there could be potentially a bad thing. I'm not quite sure there's attention if in one case challenging the system is good and the other may be challenging. The system has more of a gray area of issues.

Speaker 1:          30:32          Well, I think you've hit the nail on the head. I think that, uh, the pension goes away if we say, well, uh, you know, the reason we are troubled by Eichmann's failure to ask any questions about the, the, the, what he was being asked to do within the legal order of the Third Reich is that it was an illegitimate legal order. It was, uh, as, uh, RN says somewhere in that was a criminal regime. Um, and it was his failure to recognize that that makes us uncomfortable. On the other hand, when we start talking about the system of international law, um, it has its imperfections, but we're much more ambivalent about saying people can ignore it with impunity because we don't see it as an illegitimate order in the same way that we did. Um, so I think you're exactly right. When you, when you point out that, that the apparent, this is not a real tension, it's an apparent tension, which depends for appearing to be attention on the fact that we, most of us don't have any qualms in thinking about the third wife has an illegitimate regime.

Speaker 1:          31:47          Uh, and that that's why we're uncomfortable with his actions. Whereas a, when you do have at least a Fred's lane, uh, legitimate international legal order, uh, we become uncomfortable with people who flout that. So I think that's right. But it places the central question of this course into sharp relief because our question is, well, what is it that makes it a regime legitimate or illegitimate? You know, if we say you have an ob an an obligation to resist an illegitimate regime and to obey and legitimate one, uh, that just pushes the question one step further back, what is it that makes her regime legitimate? And, um, that is the question that we're going to, uh, organize our discussion in the, in the coming weeks and months. We're basically going to explore five answers to that question or five types of answers are five classes of answers to that question.

Speaker 1:          32:52          And they represent the main ways in which political legitimacy has been thought about in the western tradition over the past several hundred years. Um, the first one that we're going to look at is the utilitarian tradition and the utilitarian tradition, which we are going to trace back to Jeremy Bentham. Um, we'll start talking about on Friday, says that a regime is legitimate to the extent that it maximizes the greatest happiness of the greatest number of its citizens. Now, there's huge arguments within the utilitarian tradition as to what counts as happiness, how you measure it, what you do if promoting the happiness of SOM comes at the expense of the happiness of others. Um, all of those things get argued about endlessly in the utilitarian tradition. And we will explore some of those arguments as we go along. But the basic idea is that good regimes, legitimate regimes, maximize the utility or the happiness of people who are subject to them.

Speaker 1:          34:12          And then the second set of answers, the second tradition we're going to look at is the Marxist tradition, which comes into its own in the 19th century. And that basically identifies the legitimacy of the state with the presence or absence of exploitation. Legitimate governments are those that try to prevent exploitation and illegitimate governments or those that facilitate exploitation. Again, just as in the utilitarian tradition, there are huge disagreements about how to identify utility and measure it in the Marxian tradition from the beginning. Uh, there've been huge disagreement about what constitutes exploitation, how you would note when you see it, what would be involved in eradicating it and how governments might or might not be able to do that. Um, but at the end of the day, it is the presence of exploitation that is the marker of an illegitimate order and it's the possibility of escaping, um, exploitation that creates the possibility of a legitimate order. And so the Marxian answer to the question of legitimate, the legitimacy revolves around this idea of exploitation. The third tradition we've got to look at is, is what's commonly known as the social contract tradition and the social contract tradition founds the legitimacy of a political order in the notion of consent agreement.

Speaker 1:          35:55          Again, you'll find just us with all these other traditions, a lot of disagreement about what constitutes agreement, what constitutes consent? Is it some people who actually agreed at some point in the past

Speaker 1:          36:12          that should bind us? You know, the, the American founders agreed on certain things and therefore we should be bound by what they were agreed upon or is it what any rational person would agree to? Is it a hypothetical idea of consent? Um, does the consent have to be active? Do people actually have to engage in consent or can it be tacit? Can you demonstrate your consent simply by not leaving? All of these issues will get, um, a lot of attention when we look at the social contract tradition, but in all up for all of their internal differences and disagreements, this social contract tradition comes down to the proposition that the legitimacy of the state is rooted in the consent of the governed. The fourth tradition we're going to consider is what I call and the syllabus and the Anti Enlightenment tradition reacting against those first three enlightenment traditions and the anti enlightened tradition appeals to tradition. Um, it, it's the tradition tradition. Um, the legitimacy of this state resides and is discovered in the inherited norms, practices and traditions off a society. Again, we will find people struggling with and arguing over what constitutes the tradition, how you all know a tradition when you trip over it. What happens when people disagree about what the tradition implies. Um, all those questions are on the table once we start appealing to tradition. But, um, at the end of the day, it is, it is the appeal to tradition itself that becomes important that when you criticize the government, you have to um,

Speaker 2:          38:14          yeah,

Speaker 1:          38:15          appeal to something that's imminent in an accepted, in the tradition. Um, the rights of Englishman, let's say, um, as it was appeal to in the 18th century. Um, and then there's a tradition about what the rights of Englishman of thought to the beam going all the way back to Magna Carta. Um, that becomes the basis for arguing about the legitimacy of the price and actions of the government. The faith tradition we're going to look at is the democratic tradition and the democratic tradition says that the legitimacy of the state depends upon the extent to which it abays something which we'll call the principle of affected interests. That is whether those people whose interests are affected by its actions get to control what it does cause cousin enough consent you might say. And indeed the democratic tradition is a close cousin of the social contract tradition. But at the end of the day it's a different tradition. Um, and often works through but not always the idea of majority rule. And the, so the, again, in the democratic tradition there are huge controversies about how we operationalize and apply this idea of affected anxious is the basis of politics. Um, but the, the underlying notion is that if you couldn't resolve those issues trying to make the government, the um,

Speaker 1:          39:54          agent of people who are affected by what it does is the name of the game in promoting legitimacy and undermining illegitimacy of the steak. So those are the, those are the five traditions. We're going to explore them and we're going to come back again and again, not only to the Eichmann problem, but to are there practical examples that throw this question of the legitimacy of the state into sharp relief. But at the end of the day, we are always trying to understand what the basis for political legitimacy actually is.

Speaker 2:          40:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          40:37          We have a couple of minutes for questions if,

Speaker 2:          40:40          okay.

Speaker 1:          40:40          Anyone would like to,

Speaker 2:          40:47          yeah, it's Mike over here.

Speaker 12:         40:54          Oh, what about the notion that might makes right and at the most powerful stays the most legitimate.

Speaker 1:          41:00          Okay. Says what about the notion that might makes, right. And it's the most powerful states that get the deed to dictate what legitimacy is. I mean, you could say that after all, you know, when, if you think, think about the example we've been considering today, at the end of the Second World War, um, we had the Nuremberg trials run by, you know, an American Supreme Court justice. They went to Germany. They did a lot of what Israel did in 1960. Actually, you know, they tried these Germans by, uh, laws hadn't existed at the time for obeying the laws that had existed at that time. Many of them were executed. Many of them were in prison. You could say, this is just, this is just, um, might, makes, right. If somebody else had won the war, there would have been a different outcome. Um, so this is a, this is a doctrine which we will consider in the, in the course of our discussion actually of utilitarianism. Um, it is for those of you who want the jargon that the doctrine of legal positivism, anyone want to take a crack at what legal positivism means? Anybody know? No reason you should know

Speaker 1:          42:16          legal positivism was the doctrine that said,

Speaker 2:          42:21          okay,

Speaker 1:          42:22          exactly what this gentleman here has been saying,

Speaker 2:          42:25          that

Speaker 1:          42:28          what makes something law is the bell. The ability to get people to obey.

Speaker 2:          42:33          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          42:34          You know, if you go back into medieval Europe, we'll find the distinction between natural law and positive law. Natural law is sometimes I identified with the will of God, sometimes with timeless universal moral principles, some higher law by reference to which we judge what actual legal systems go are doing. So when we say the Third Reich was a criminal regime and illegitimate regime where ultimately appealing to some kind of higher laws, some natural law idea as to what constitutes a legitimate regime. Right? And we're going to talk a lot more about natural law later. Well, legal positivism was the doctrine that there is no such thing as natural law. Jeremy Bentham who are going to start talking about on Friday says natural law, natural rights. It's dangerous nonsense, nonsense on stilts. There's no such thing as natural law and he is considered as the one of the, um, intellectual sources for this doctrine of legal positivism, which comes into its own in the 19 century.

Speaker 1:          43:51          They're just there. If you know, you, if you say, well, there is no higher law, then the question is, well then why didn't, what is law based on one and say is power? Bentham wanted to say it should be based on science. As I mentioned to you last time, the enlightenment is all about faith in science. Um, so we, we will, we will consider a version of that argument when we come to talk about utilitarianism. Um, but it's a, it's a good point to make, particularly in this, the context of the Eichmann problem. Now what we're gonna, what we're gonna do. I realize now, I misspoke when I said we're going to talk about Bentham on fire. I didn't, I didn't, why didn't some astute person say, no, you're not. We're actually going to talk about lock. Now you might say, well why are you going to talk about loc? And the answer is that lock actually performs two different functions in this course, um, that you will see they, they, uh, they come together, uh, later on. You'll see how they come together later in the course. But a lock on the one hand we are using as somebody to provide us with a way of understanding the enlightenment.

Speaker 2:          45:15          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          45:16          Move in politics. And as I sent you, the enlightenment move involves a twin commitment to the ideas of science as the basis for social organization and

Speaker 1:          45:30          freedom as the highest good. And that that enlightenment pair of assumptions is going to inform the first three traditions we look at, right? The utilitarian tradition, the Marxian tradition and the social contract tradition lock will also be looked at later as a representative of the social contract tradition. But what are we going to do in Friday's lecture is think about the broad themes of the enlightenment for which, uh, the lock reading it is there and what, and, and it's, it's going to provide the background and we will not actually get to utilitarianism until next Wednesday. One thing I would say to you about the lock, uh, going in on the one hand, and you know, it's a tremendously famous buckets being in print continuously for more than 300 years, it's been translated into all the world's languages. Um, all the world's major languages and many of the world's mine languages, um, locks most important political writing for sure.

Speaker 2:          46:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          46:42          Uh, it's not a fast weed. It's not, um, it's a political pamphlet. It, you know, it was written for a very particular political purpose that I'll tell you something about, but it's, it's not a fast we'd in the sense that what you read for today, it's a fast read and some of it's gonna go right by you. And that's okay. Um, because you might, you might think, well, not only is it not a fast read, but he's going to do a lot of this in one lecture. Uh, it seems like a lot to do in 15 minutes, but the truth is we're going to come back to lock again and again through this course and you, what you're going to discover is that the ghost of Locke is hovering behind us, uh, all the way through. Um, in many ways, modern democratic theory is a footnote to lock a, and you'll, so you'll see, we will consider lock as a father of the enlightenment as a representative of the social contract tradition. And then lockin considerations will come in, uh, to the Marxist tradition, to the democratic tradition, uh, to the social contract tradition, uh, as well. So, um, some of what you read for Friday, we'll go by you don't worry about it because we're going to revisit lock again and again and again, uh, as we go through the course. Okay? So we will see you on Friday. And then that's when we'll begin talking about John Law.
