Speaker 1:          00:01          So in Monday's lecture, we let something slip by all of us without a comment that we probably should not have let slip by. And it's something I want to focus on today. That is when we spelled out mill's harm principle. I said, does everybody, sure. They know what it means. Nevermind whether you agree with it or not, but whether you sure that you understand what he's saying. And we all agreed that at least it was clear. In fact though, it's ambiguous and this is the highlighted phrase here is the ambiguity I want to focus on. Um, at the end of that long paragraph, I read you when we, when Miller saying, um, if you think something's bad for somebody or that they shouldn't do it, remember I give you the x gave you the example of going to law school when I don't think it's good for you.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Um, mill says those may be good reasons for romance straighting with them or reasoning with him or persuading him or treating him, but not for compelling him or visiting him with any evil in case he decided to do otherwise. To justify that, I need to justify forcing somebody to do something or prohibiting somebody from doing something. The conduct from Wishard is desired to deter him, must be calculated to produce evil, to someone else must be calculated to produce evil from someone else. And there are two issues raised by that phrase that I really want us to focus on with laser like intensity. In today's lecture, the one is signaled by the passive voice in it must be calculated with that obviously puts on the table who does the calculating, right? And secondly, what does it mean calculated? It could be, it could mean calculated as he an intended.

Speaker 1:          02:03          I didn't intend to harm you. There was no calculation to harm you when I got parallel, literally drunk behind the wheel of a car. And then I don't even remember putting the keys in the wheel and driving out. I didn't intend to harm you, right? Or is it a third party calculation, um, by again, then we get to the question by whom? Who's going to decide who's going to do the calculating? So what is calculated actually mean and who is it that's going to do the calculating? Those are the things we're going to zero in on today. And I thought the best way into it was to consider some examples. And when I left you with on Monday was what about prostitution? This is what is sometimes referred to as a so called victimless crime. After all, um, the chance action between the tropic prostitute and a client is a parade. Oh, superior transaction. Right? It's a voluntary market transaction. They wouldn't do it if it didn't make both people better off. Um, so should we just say from male's point of view, there's no harm here. Truly is a victimless crime and we shouldn't make things at all if they are victimized. How many people think that makes sense? I about half the thanks. That doesn't make sense. Nobody. Yeah. Okay. So what, why, why doesn't it makes sense? Somebody who thinks it doesn't make sense,

Speaker 1:          03:46          why is it not the over here? You, why were you thinking it didn't make sense?

Speaker 2:          03:53          Okay.

Speaker 3:          03:56          Um, even though it's victimless, I think there's harming yourself has some sort of implications. I think there's this, oh, it's that

Speaker 1:          04:04          prostitute harming herself

Speaker 3:          04:07          sort of. I think I just like some moral implications in there. Let's be going. What kinds of implications? Um,

Speaker 2:          04:15          yeah,

Speaker 3:          04:16          besides just like harming, I don't think I said, okay, let me take that back. Harming herself. It might harm society in the sense that it brings down society's a moral standard.

Speaker 1:          04:26          Okay. It might harm society. Um, males very clear that he wants to reject the idea that there were social rights. So, so he wouldn't accept that. But I don't think you should give up so quickly. Um, is, is there some other way of articulating what you have in mind there? When you say harm society, what do you mean? What if you unpack? What does it mean when you really, when you say harm society, it's tricky. Anyone else want to have a go? Yeah, right behind you. Um, I guess it poses a negative externality on society. Okay. What is the negative externality? We'll, I guess in the case of prostitution and could be, um, the objectification of women in this case, objectification of women. Okay. And that, that,

Speaker 2:          05:19          yep.

Speaker 1:          05:20          How would we say that's a harm to society? Maybe it would be, again, a male's cannot reject the idea that society has a right not to be harmed so high. How can it play out in a way that doesn't involve making that plan? It's society.

Speaker 2:          05:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:40          Well, I guess it, you could say it poses a negative externality on the individuals and the society by him August on women on women play and it poses a negative externality on women at reinforces a set of stereotypes and so on. Okay. So that might be one way in which prostitution causes harm. Any other ways? Yes sir.

Speaker 4:          06:03          Um, it could also be said that it is a negative extra nowaday because it undermines family values.

Speaker 1:          06:09          It undermines fat family value,

Speaker 4:          06:12          which would then in turn like hurt children and like the future

Speaker 1:          06:15          that would in turn her children.

Speaker 2:          06:19          Yeah.

Speaker 5:          06:21          Um, well I think it's difficult also to just connect prostitution from the, like this sort of theoretical model from the actual model of prostitution. I think when we put sort of, you know, pimps in sexual slavery and that sort of thing into the picture, then the harm becomes far more real and it's questionable whether people are, um, voluntarily participating in these transactions to begin with.

Speaker 1:          06:43          Okay. So if you are really hard boiled million libertarian, I think why slavery is not an issue, slaves or taken by force, but, um, selling yourself into indentured servitude, not obviously something would Melsa you should be allowed to do that. Your choice Trekkie was, you're really giving up your, you're, you're really giving up your Tonomy. It's sort of, you'll see in politics, we can front later in the course, what do you do with an election where a party runs as in Algeria in 1991 sang if elected, we are going to abolish democracy and they get elected,

Speaker 2:          07:29          uh, should that,

Speaker 1:          07:32          you know, in the, in that case, the Algerian military stepped in. But, so should, if somebody says, I'm going to sell myself into servitude, it's a voluntary act, should we save them from this themself?

Speaker 2:          07:44          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:45          That, that's a very tricky one. But let's set those ones aside and I think there would be similar issues with suicide for mail. Should you allow it be allowed to stop people committing suicide? Those are very hard. I think. Um, there's separate though from these issues about what we're calling externalities. People are saying, of course there are harmful effects of prostitution. It, it harms women. Um, it may undermine certain kinds of moral codes. Um, what would males say in response to that?

Speaker 2:          08:19          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          08:22          Well, I think for me it really depends on the context of an act. So you can be drunk at home, but you can't be a policemen drunk on the job. So if we look at prostitution, if you're, you know, working as a free agent, sure you can engage in prostitution, but if you're a father and you're married, then he would probably view that as something not okay. So it really matters for him what the context is of a certain transaction.

Speaker 1:          08:48          Okay. I think that's, that's right. And you could imagine a more refined version of the harm that tried to incorporate that. I gave the example last time, I think I said male would presumably be completely comfortable with outgrowing drunk driving, uh, and punishing that activity but not punishing drinking. So presumably, uh, you know, the principal would be, be some version of interfere with, with human conduct as, as little as possible to prevent harm. Right. So you, it's, it's, it's killing a Gnat with a sledgehammer to outlawed drinking just because some people drive drunk. I think that's fair enough. But, but I think some of the people who are saying allowing prostitution has big a negative externalities wouldn't give up that quickly. Anyone. We think we shouldn't give up that quickly. That there's something else here. Nobody, maybe they would give up that quick.

Speaker 2:          09:52          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:55          Okay. Well we'll, we'll just, we'll leave that aside for a minute, but, uh, and, and come back to it. So

Speaker 1:          10:04          if you, if you, if you now bearing this in mind, go back and reread, um, on liberty. I think what you'll come away with is, it's actually quite confusing. Just what mail means by harm, because that some harms he wants to say are trivial harms. So the harm you Safa through not getting a place in college, in a competitive exam, right? He's knocking out loud. That harm ultimately to be dispositive, it's going to allow that to be outweighed by the benefits to society of competitive meritocracy. Uh, and remember our three straight discussion last time. So some harms are more significant than other harms and some harms are outweighed by utilitarian benefits. It seems like some of the time if he's, you know, mail saying, um,

Speaker 1:          11:07          prohibition shouldn't be allowed. He's saying essentially, you know, unless I intend to do you some harm, you might find it offensive that I sit around drinking all day. But you know, it's not know your business. You might have family values which say, um, uh, that, that if there are people out there who are prostitutes, it undermines the family. That's your family value. Thank you very much. It's not my family value, right? So you could take that view. And after all, if you think about the, the debate we've had in this country about gay marriage over the past decade or so, that's exactly what the, the claim and the counterclaim, right? Some people say, um, there's no reason in the world that gay people should be prevented from getting married. They're not hurting anybody else. Uh, and then, you know, people say, well, that undermines traditional family values, right? And the, the, the people who support gay marriage say, well, so what, those are your traditional family values, but they're not out traditional family values. And why should yours? This is awful. The what mill says the tyranny of majority opinions. So what, right. This is supposed to protect individual freedom against,

Speaker 2:          12:29          okay?

Speaker 1:          12:29          So one person's traditional family values is another person's tyranny of a majority opinion. How are you going to resolve that? What mechanisms does smell have to resolve that? And I think you could read on liberty with a fine tooth comb and not come up with one.

Speaker 2:          12:49          Okay?

Speaker 1:          12:49          And so you could say, well, so much the worst for male. We thought we had this wonderful reits, utilities synthesis, you know, we're all good things would go together. We could respect individual freedoms and promotes social, a utilitarian efficiency based on science all at the same time. But actually it turns out to all be, uh, resting on a hail of sand. And the minute you walk on it, you start sinking. Um, and I think this is a, this is a good time to go back to the point I made to you right at the beginning of the course when I said, um, you shouldn't be expecting the sell silver bullet in this course. You shouldn't be expecting to find the theory that answers all your questions. What instead you're going to find this particular insights that you can pick up and put into your bag of tricks and move on with, because I think it is at the end of the day a good critique of mill to say there is no single definition of harm and there's no good account of who makes the decisions about harm. Uh, and so to that extent, um, his claim at the beginning of on liberty, that there's one simple principle and this is what it is, fails. Nonetheless,

Speaker 1:          14:18          there's some important and enduring insights here that I think we're not getting one to let go off. One is

Speaker 2:          14:27          okay.

Speaker 1:          14:28          When you think about all of the ways human beings interact and all of the things we do that cause us to have the possibility of bumping into one another, maybe it shouldn't be the case that there is a single definition of harm because different definitions of harm are relevant to different

Speaker 2:          14:52          types of situation. This is a little like the point somebody here made that Mel would be interested in the context. If you think about, um,

Speaker 1:          15:06          physicians, we allow physicians to buy malpractice insurance in case they kill you by mistake when they're doing surgery. But we don't allow bank robbers to buy malpractice insurance so that if they kill you by mistake when they're robbing a bank, they can, they can, uh, get off. That tells you right there, there must be different conceptions of harm that operate in different circumstances. And indeed, if you want to start thinking about it a little bit more, uh, systematically harm is treated very differently in different situations. Think about this continuum I've put up here some kinds of harm. Arec, completely excluded. You're not, you're not held responsible for them at all. If, if you have a death penalty, a Neagle execution of people, of course you harm the person, you execute certain kinds of, of wartime killing. Of course you harm the person that you kill. But we allow it. We don't count it as a relevant harm. Then here I'm going down this continuum. We say that the intention to kill is very important in the criminal law. We have this idea, anyone know what this term, mens rea is and the criminal law, no reason you should, but somebody might.

Speaker 2:          16:44          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          16:44          If, if you're charging somebody with a criminal offense that the government has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, various elements of the crime that the person did it, um, that, that there was in fact that the crime occurred and that there was something called the mens rea or criminal intent, guilty mind. That's, that's what it means. I'm in the criminal law when we make that one of the elements of the crime. That's why things like the insanity defense becomes so contentious because the person claims, while I didn't have, because I didn't know what I was doing, I didn't have mens rea. My client didn't have man's dre. He didn't know what he was doing, so he's not guilty by reason of insanity is not guilty. Okay. Or if you think about, you might say, well we do, we do imprison people for Valet vehicular homicide when they get drunk and the person says, but I didn't intend to kill them. I didn't know that I, I didn't know I was driving. How can you say intended? Interestingly, there we come up with a doctrine of in the legal system, which we call constructive intent and what is the doctrine of a construct of intent. It's basically we say, well, any reasonable person would know that if you drive down to a bar and you have no way to get home and you then drink 10 beers,

Speaker 1:          18:22          you would be, you would be putting yourself in position where you could harm someone. So construct, we're going to impute the intent to you, even though you didn't have it. That's the doctrine of constructive intent that's using exactly that kind of situation. So in the criminal law to go back to mail, we'd say calculated to produce evil in someone else has got to be calculated by the person committing the harm. Okay. So why is that? You might say, well, criminal actions are actions which bring moral disapproval, a program on people. We lock them up. They're really thinks we don't want people to do. And we want people to internalize the incentive not to do them. So it's about their intentional actions and then we punish them for those actions. And therefore, um, we want, when we, when we put sanctions on them, we want them to know, uh, that they could have behaved otherwise. And so we want the intent to be pricing. So construct them in Canada is sort of like intent, but not exactly what about negligence. Negligence is even less like constructive intent. So negligence is the doctrine that let's suppose you're living in a neighborhood where there are lots of children,

Speaker 1:          20:00          well children and you put in a swimming pool. Um, and, and let's say the law requires that there be your fence and your swimming pool, but you leave the, you leave the fence, open the gate open and at child goes hand in, falls into your pool and drowns. The doctrine of negligence would say, well yeah, she of course you're dating in 10 the that the child would drown but you were negligent and leaving your door open or you're, you're leaving the gate open. So we're going to hold you responsible. So it's, it's a little less than constructive intent. It's negligent. You were, any reasonable person would know that you shouldn't leave the gate open. So you were, um, it's still a state of mind, but it's obviously not the same thing. Um, as intending to kill the child. And then we could go even further down the continuum and say, you know, there's some situations where we say, we don't care about your state of mind at all. So if an adult has sex with a 14 year old

Speaker 2:          21:15          yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:16          And walks in and says, well your honor, she said she was 20 and I thought she was 20, she looked 20 and, and perhaps that's true. Perhaps all of those things were true. She said she was 20. I thought she was 20 and she looked 20. We don't care. We say as a society, we don't care.

Speaker 2:          21:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:38          That's the notion of statutory rape. It's or sometimes called strict liability. We're going to hold you liable anyway. And why do we do that? Presumably to give people the incentive to make sure to as defined out. Um, so when we say if she was 14 it statutory rape or if he was 14 and she was 20, it's statutory right? There it is. Uh, too bad. We don't care what she said. And, um, we don't care what you, you believed at the time because we want to, to ensure that people have the incentive to find that out correctly.

Speaker 1:          22:26          Or we could think of Good Samaritan laws. This is the situation where you're walking along a and you see somebody drowning in a lake and had very little cost to yourself. You could pull them out, but you say, you know, I'm late for class and my mind, your, you know, I didn't push you in the lake. In many states we have good Samaritan laws, which if it, if it really wasn't no trivial cost to yourself, you could have done that. You can be prosecuted for failing to assist somebody in need of your help. Okay. So that's obviously a very capacious definition of harm. I mean, after all, the fact that we're all sitting here rather than doing relief work in Haiti right now means presumably that some people are suffering, perhaps even dying as a result of our failure to go to Haiti right now.

Speaker 1:          23:33          So it, once you go over this line into set treating omissions to help as a form of harm as we do with good Samaritan laws, where will it end? Right? So you can see from this that if you wanted one definition of harm to cover all situations, that obviously isn't gonna make any sense. Nonetheless, if you, it, you think about this continuum, um, where you fall on, it has huge implications for how you're gonna run your society. And more interestingly than that, these things, this, I've given you a kind of static picture now, but these things actually change. Think about the drug thalidomide. Who knows what happened with the letter mine. Yeah. What happened with the later mine.

Speaker 2:          24:34          Okay.

Speaker 4:          24:35          Um, it came out in the late fifties. It was used to treat morning sickness and it turns out that, uh, the re-estimate of the drug, uh, causes teratoma and children born to women taking the drug. And so it was basically a failure of the drug industry to look into the effects of, um, the different structures of drugs in humans.

Speaker 1:          24:55          Correct. Okay. And what's, that's a very good summary. And what's interesting about thalidomide from our point of view is that the, in developing this drug which was given for morning sickness, um, the comp, the drug, the pharmaceutical companies didn't cut any corners. They did all that, the clinical trials correctly, they got the FDA approvals, everything was done by the book. There was not, there was no, uh, nothing illicit was done. And at that time, the general stand it in tort liability. That is tort tort does, who knows what tort means? T O r t not T. O. R. T. A. We're not talking about chocolate cake. What's a tort?

Speaker 1:          25:47          Nobody knows what a tort is toward. Just means harm, right? So the general standard for Tort liability was negligence and they weren't negligent. They did it by the book. They got all, they got all of the approvals, they got the clinical trials, the FDA approved the drug. And it's a famous case because it was an instrument by which the courts decided to say, you know what? We don't care. We don't care. They moved from negligence, negligence, strict liability. We don't care that you did it. All right. The fact is there are all of these children who are born with missing limbs and you're going to pay you, the drug companies are going to pay. We're going to hold you strictly liable. We're going to treat it like the example I gave before statutory. Right now you might say, well why, why would you do that? And interestingly,

Speaker 1:          27:02          the the move in American tort law from negligence to strict liability, those of you who go to go on from here to the yell loss go, we'll learn all about it because the intellectual, a giant of the move from the negligence to strict liability was Guido Kalibrasi, longtime dean of the Yale Law School and now a federal judge on the second circuit. Um, he wrote a book called the costs of accidents and the main argument of the costs of accidents, it was, this was actually about auto accidents. It was essentially utilitarian in that caliber breezy looked at free for, um,

Speaker 2:          27:48          okay,

Speaker 1:          27:48          what had already started in, in New Jersey at that time. If people rear end one another in, in cars, you can say, well, what, who was negligent care? Was it the driver in front or why is it the dryer in the back? If it was the driver in the front, why? Oh, well he stopped too quickly or something like that. Will, you know, uh, something like that. Or the driver at the back says, well, my brakes weren't working. Or the driver at the front light brake lights weren't working or something like, you know, you have an argument and they have their lawyer and you have your lawyer and you Duke it out and somebody wins and somebody loses is how many New Jersey said it's not worth it.

Speaker 1:          28:30          It's a waste of court time. It's a waste of everybody's time. So we're going to make the law, which says in an in rear ending situation, the car, the driver at the back pays always kind of rough justice. Sometimes. Maybe the brake lights on the front car really weren't working. We don't care. It's just not worth the state of New Jersey's time to invest in institutional resources and all the rest of it to allow people to litigate these things just just cost too much. It's not worth it. So Guido Calabresi came up with a little algorithm in which he said the standards should be to minimize the costs of accidents plus the costs of their avoidance. So you figure out the costs of, of all the rear ending, right? And then you say to yours and then you figure out, well, if we allow people to, so what's the cost of avoiding accidents that way? Whereas if we allow, if we don't allow them to sue for negligence, what's the cost? That way it's cheaper. It's more efficient and anyway, way probably property. Some good side benefits. It gives the person at the back the right incentive to keep a distance. They can stop, right? Uh, so we make a utilitarian judge chess not, you know, the game's not worth the candle for negligence.

Speaker 2:          29:53          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          29:53          That's one defense. Hobbit. Um, coming back to the thalidomide, minimize the costs of accidents and the costs of their avoidance. What do we want as a society? We want the drug companies to have the incentive to go the extra mile to do even more research. Then they didn't have to do restaurant Clyde by the FDA to buy the insurance because perhaps they're the deepest pocket. They have the resources to do the research and to buy the insurance. If you're thinking about if you're a pregnant woman, thinking about taking a morning sickness pill or not taking it, you don't have the resources to do extra research. Um,

Speaker 2:          30:36          okay.

Speaker 1:          30:36          So we put, we put the burden on the party who can most cheaply avoid it. Now the drug companies, that's outrageous. It's totally outrageous. We didn't do anything wrong. And you're punishing us. Strict liability. So we moved and, and the example of thalidomide is just a tip of an iceberg and the hall of Tort Law, there's been this 30 or 40 year move from a negligence standard to a strict liability standard NF. Fascinating intellectual debate between Kalibrasi who is the champion of strict liability and Richard Posner, who you will probably have read some of his books, a judge and the Chicago circuit who defends negligence as more efficient. So it's an, it's a debate between utilitarians in that sense. And if, if we had more time, I would have you read some of that debate. Um, but as a matter of the, you might say, you might be convinced at the end of it that Posner winds intellectually, but as a matter of the politics of it, Kalibrasi wins. That is to say American tort law has moved since the 1950s away from strict liability, uh, away from negligence, strict liability. Let's think of another example.

Speaker 1:          32:03          In the 1950s in America, a high spend could not be prosecuted for raping his wife. There was no such crime.

Speaker 1:          32:17          It was, in other words, a conclusive common law presumption that there was no such crime. Now, you might say, why? While there's a historical answer, a went back to then the suspension of the legal identity of the woman during marriage, essentially all it goes back to the old patriarchal laws. The daughter was more or less the father's property, and then he gave his property to the son in law as, as the husband's property. So the woman didn't, didn't have a legal identity as a person during marriage. And this is why, uh, she lost control of her property. Right. And that was restored ultimately by the myriad woman's property acts, um, that re recreated a women's property rights of a say inherited wealth or whatever it was. It didn't automatically become her husband's property, but there was this hang of a from the 19th century that, um,

Speaker 2:          33:22          okay,

Speaker 1:          33:23          a woman, a woman couldn't be right by her husband, uh, and not only write but other things like assault. So in other words, uh, a woman you could walk up to a woman you are not married to on the street and punch her in the face and get arrested for that and convicted of assault. But if you did it to your wife, there was no crime. So then we have,

Speaker 2:          33:51          yeah,

Speaker 1:          33:51          the women's movement, we have a lot of feminists pressure an organization. And so we now have gone to a world in which, um, marital rape is a felony in about 45 of the states and the federal system. So it's gone from being, having a conclusive common law presumption against it, to making it a felony. And all the other things have gone as well. So into spousal tort, immunity is gone. Uh, you can be prosecuted for assaulting. In other words, marriage is no longer a bar. Two things that would be criminal actions outside. So we, we've had a huge change in the law there from one definition of what counts as are relevant harm to a different definition of what counts as irrelevant harm. In the first case, it was an argument about efficiency. And the second is a political movement. Uh, the women's movement had this enormous impact on the redefinition of what sorts of harms the state should take seriously in marriage. Let me give you a third example.

Speaker 2:          35:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          35:09          If you go into employment law, housing law, um, or education,

Speaker 2:          35:17          mmm.

Speaker 1:          35:19          The American courts have for many decades, at least since Brown vs board of education was a handed down by a unanimous supreme court in 1954. They've been concerned with trying to get rid of discrimination. Discrimination is a kind of harm, right? So the question is, what do you have to show? What do you have to show to convince the court that you been harmed? Initially there should be a remedy. What do you have to shout? And during the Warren Court,

Speaker 1:          36:04          it was somewhat like strict liability. The Warren Court, all Warren was appointed by President Eisenhower in 1953. Eisenhower authority was appointing a conservative justice, but he turned out to be wrong. Oh, Warren was perhaps the most liberal, uh, chief justice of the 20th century. And He, the, the court under his, under his leadership, uh, develop the idea that all you had to do was show there was a pattern of discriminatory effects. You didn't have to show that any buddy intended to discriminate against anyone. So in the education area, separate but equal, the court said is inherently unequal. It doesn't, we're not saying that that white southerners are necessarily prejudice against blacks. Many of them were, but we don't, we're not getting get to that question. We just sang separate, but equal is inherently impossible. It's an oxymoron. You can't have it. Uh, and we were saying that without reference to the intentions of school administrators or anybody else, um, in, in housing patterns,

Speaker 1:          37:27          if you see, um, you know, you do these kinds of studies like ens and the Yale law school, he has a well known for having done, um, when people with exactly the same objective characteristics, same income, same employment history and saw and going for a mortgage. It turns out that African Americans are denied mortgages at a higher rate than non African Americans. You don't have to show that that mortgage officer was a racist doors in Kandin you just, you, you produced this to test x. You show, you know, people at these objective characteristics who are African American get denied. And these are those the same act, the same characteristics who are not African Americans don't get denied. It's a pattern of discriminatory effects. We don't have to get into something like man's rail, whatever's going on in the the bank mortgage offices head. So that was the standard also in employment discrimination and many other areas of the law of under the Warren Court. All you had to show was a pattern of discriminatory effects by the Warren court was gradually replaced. First buy the Burger court, then the rank was cord, and now the Roberts court. And in that conservative evolution, discrimination law has gone this way on the continuum.

Speaker 1:          39:01          Now you can't get a remedy unless you can show the part the intention to discriminate on the part of some public official. So let's say in zoning ordinances, you've got to show that some public official actually tried to do the zoning in such a way as to exclude blacks from a certain neighborhood, let's say, um, before you couldn't get a remedy. So an employment we've been and, and housing and education and all of these areas of discrimination, we've gone the other way as a society, right? We've gone from a, a very capacious standed, which would allow us, allow our remedy just from the objective indicators, the patterns of discriminatory effects. Now we treat it more like the, the criminal law we say, unless you can show the, you can establish in court that there was some particular person in that bank denying mortgages who intended to discriminate, no remedy. So it's much harder of course to get remedies. So those are three examples. Those are three examples. The thalidomide, the marital rape and the discrimination where you can see that this enormous flux in our society as to what counts as are relevant harm.

Speaker 2:          40:46          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          40:46          You know, and if we had time, I strongly suspect if we had time to have a debate in this room on those three topics, it's not like we would, we would all agree as to, you know, whether in discrimination law it should be

Speaker 2:          41:06          okay.

Speaker 1:          41:06          Patent has no discriminatory effects or intent. We'd have a differences of opinion about that. That would stem from our assumptions about the appropriate role of government, um, how intrusive it should be and so on. Or probably there would be less, there would be less disagreement today about the marital rape. Then there would have been in the 1950s and I suspect intuitions would go all over the place, uh, about

Speaker 2:          41:37          okay,

Speaker 1:          41:38          tort liability and that's the later mine. So what does that tell us? This is the second reason I think it's really instructive to work through somebody like Mel. Even if in the end, Mel doesn't have the answer. I think one of the, the lessons of this course, and this is, you can see it here very dramatically, is that it's, it is impossible to get rid of political disagreement. It is impossible to reduce political choices, to sign Catholic choices all the way down. Science can play important roles in making political choices, but they can't, it can't make them for us. So that one of the big goals of the enlightenment to come up with scientific principles of politics is never going to be perfectly realized. That doesn't mean it can't be partially realized, but it's never going to be perfectly realize. You can't ring the politics out of politics. There's no way to do it. And so you know if you will, you will see when we come to read Marx and he talks about his utopian communist society. One of his is great guys. Great. One Line is one of his one liners is that politics at the, at the end of the day when we finally have the true communist Utopia, politics will be replaced by administration, right? That's a bumper sticker for saying we're going to ring the politics out of politics. Bentham,

Speaker 2:          43:29          okay.

Speaker 1:          43:30          Looking for the right objective, utilitarian calculus, right? Mel wants to say while once the harm is triggered, we can bring, we can, we can do the cost benefit analysis on scientific principles. We talked about that last time. Never works. It never works all the way down. It doesn't mean to say that scientific thinking, current condition, our normative choices, but you'll go back and think through these three examples that I've just given you. These are basically normative choices, right? In the 1950s when this issue about marital rape came up, a lot of things were sad that a seminar to what is said now about gay marriage, people said, if the state starts prosecuting husbands, we're going to destroy the traditional family. You know, and people in the women's movement said, great, we're going to destroy this traditional family because at g man shouldn't be allowed to write women, at least in this respect. We want to write that. So traditional values only takes you so far because the harm principle is, you know, by definition, a critical principle for looking at traditional values and saying, how much should we cater to them? How much not right? So

Speaker 1:          44:59          these are political choices. The choice about the letter might has huge distributed consequences, right? You Do, you normous you're going to say to, to pharmaceutical companies, you're going to be liable from now on for the harm, harmful effects of your drugs, regardless of whether you got the FDA approval that that has put, it's a huge, it's a huge burden to put on them. You notice what we could say, we could say no. You know, as a famous libertarian judge learned hand said in society losses, Miss Lie, where they fall. What does that mean? It basically means the women who had the thalidomide children and the children themselves must internalize the loss. Or we could say, we'll socialize, we will socialize the risk, we'll say in in these kinds of situations

Speaker 1:          46:01          when there was no wrong doing in the sense of cutting corners, the government will bail them out. You know, just like we did after nine 11 we created this huge fund and paid paid compensation to people, to the relatives of people who died at nine and 11 many people die all the time and in disasters where we don't do that, but we could, we could have massive social insurance for unexpected harms, right? So the choice to say losses, Ms lie where they fall with learning hand, right? Or that we should socialize it by saying, well, if, if you, if you are born with a physical deformity, obviously it's through no fault of your own, but really you can't blame the manufacturer of thalidomide either. So the state will pick it up. We as a society will do it. That's a different choice. Or if you say, no, we're going to make the letter MyEd the manufacturer internalize this. That's a different choice. My point he has, it's, it's always a choice. It's always a choice. We'll come to read a, a libertarian called Robert Nozick later in the course. And one of his one line is, is that the question of political theory is whether or not they should be a state.

Speaker 1:          47:36          But we'll see that that's a bit like saying the fundamental question of dental theory is whether or not they should be teeth.

Speaker 2:          47:43          Okay?

Speaker 1:          47:44          Because in fact, everything involves collective choices. Even the collective choice to let the loss. Why lie, where it falls, that is itself a collective choice. So you can't ring the politics out of politics and the, at least one goal of the enlightenment. We're going to see this, this idea of re replacing politics with science or in this formulation of politics being displaced by administration can never be perfectly realized. And that's an important insight we get from thinking about, uh, trying to apply mill's harm principle. Okay. See you on Monday.
