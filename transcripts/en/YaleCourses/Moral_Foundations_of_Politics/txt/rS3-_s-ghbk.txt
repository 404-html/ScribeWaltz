Speaker 1:          00:02          So a one way you can think about comparisons between Marxism and the utilitarian tradition is that both have a micro story and a macro story. So when you think about the utilitarian tradition, we have the micro story of the parade Oh principle and how in one, each individual transaction, uh, we'll go and then we have a macro story that if you allow people to transact freely, you get the most efficient utilitarian result of a time. And so you get the rights utility synthesis at least in the aspiration. And other way of putting that is what Adam Smith famously referred to as an invisible hand theory that while no individual participant is interested in generating an efficient aggregate outcome, indeed each individual participant is just trying to get on his hind indifference curve as possible. The biproduct of their collective individually selfish actions is this beneficent, um, overall results.

Speaker 1:          01:12          And so that's the invisible hand of the market that Smith talks about in the wealth of nations. Marks two has a micro story and macro story and an invisible hand theory. And that's why we're going to spend today's lecture. And next Monday's lecture. Talking about today, principally, we're going to focus on his micro story, uh, his, his story of how wealth gets created at the micro level under capitalism. And then we will link it, um, on Monday to his macro story. And he to you will see, has an invisible hand theory that is to say the particular players at the micro level confront incentives to behave in certain ways. Um, and the byproduct of their actions is, is a macro result, which nobody understands or intense the differences. We'll see that for Marx, the invisible hand isn't entirely benevolent. It's Bella benevolent for a while, but then it starts to become malevolent over time because of the way that the dynamics of capitalism play themselves out.

Speaker 1:          02:25          So that's the sort of where we're headed in the medium term. In the next couple of lectures I want though before heading into the micro story to make a couple of conceptual points. Um, remember that when we look at enlightenment, thinkers were concerned first and foremost with the fact that they are all motivated by the idea of individual freedom as the highest good and basing politics on scientific principles. Um, rather than appeals to or natural law or religion or tradition or anything else. And I just want to highlight what Marx is, assumptions about those two things are, I've actually mentioned these in one way or another in, in, uh, last Monday's lecture. But just to emphasize, first of all, the idea of freedom in Marx is captured beautifully in this very famous passage, um, that he wrote Ashley to relatively young marks his, his critique of The Hague aliens, um, in the and their followers Feuerbach in a work called the German ideology.

Speaker 1:          03:40          He has this, um, very vivid description of what he means by unfreedom the antithesis of he's his ideal. He says the division of Labor, which we talked about last time, offers us the first example. As long as man remains in natural society, that is as long as a cleavage exists between the particular and the common interests as long. Therefore, as activity is not voluntary, not naturally divided. Man's own deed becomes an alien. Nepal are opposed to him which enslaves him instead of being controlled by him. For as soon as the division of labor comes into being, each man has a particular exclusive sphere of activity which is forced, done. Write this down. I'll put the slides up. You can get them on the Internet. So as soon as the division of labor comes into being, each ma ma man has a particular exclusive sphere of activity which is forced upon him and which he cannot escape.

Speaker 1:          04:40          He is a hunter, a fisherman, a shepherd, or a critical critic and he must remain. So if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood while in a communist society, this is his utopian ideal when nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity, but each can become a comp accomplished in any branch. He wishes society regulates the general production and makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow. This is baby, the most famous line in all of marks to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening and criticize the after Dina just as I have a mind without ever becoming a hunter, a fisherman, a shepherd, or a critic. So this is a utopian marks, this idea that as soon as you have a division of labor, we are no longer free. We're in slave to our particular place in the division of Labor.

Speaker 1:          05:42          Remember what I read to you from Adam Smith's description of the pin factory. You know, somebody spends their whole life stretching that wire for the pin. Somebody spends their whole life putting the heads on the pin that that's a sense which marks wants to say we're alienated from our true selves once the division of Labor sets in. And we can only return to being a fully rounded human beings at one with, with ourselves when the, when the division of Labor ultimately is abolished. And a precondition for that is the super abundance of wealth that capitalism is cat capitalism is historically destined to create. Um, and how we will finally get there is the story. Marx believed of how his macro theory would play out over time. And we will only reach a communist society where people can be genuinely free once the need for a division of Labor has been obviated by the existence of a superabundance of wealth.

Speaker 1:          06:52          So all of that's coming. But this is just to underscore that is basic ideal is freedom and not equality. And his argument is going to be, as I said to you last time, that the condition for the free development of each is the free development of all second, just to come back to his and underscore his theory of science. Mark's is an objectivist. He believes that there are um, forces operating in history, which he calls the materialist conception of history, which shape the way history on faults. History has a direction. It's moving through a variety of phases. Each of which has internal contradictions. And the way they play themselves out is going to determine what happens. So that tension in a feudal society between the feudal, between the peasants and the Lords is gonna determine the way in which conflict in that society, um, occurs.

Speaker 1:          08:06          Then you'll get the emergence of a bourgeois class and they will create capitalism. But that will bring in bringing forth a working class who will get into conflicts with them. And as those conflicts play out, you'll eventually get communism and socialism. It's a reductionist theory. As I said to you before, think of Bill Clinton's line. It's the economy stupid. Most of what happens if not all of what happens that's of any importance in politics is determined by economic interests. Whether people understand this or not or agree with it or not is beside the point. And that brings us to a third element of this Marxian science that I just want to underscore which will be relevant for today's lecture, is that Marx makes a distinction between a class in itself and a class for itself. And I want to spend a couple of minutes on. First is definition of class and then this in itself for itself distinction.

Speaker 1:          09:14          A lot of people say that Mark's is auntie individual. He's not individualist because he thinks about things in terms of classes and clos conflict. That is a very superficial reading of Marx as um, a very eminent scholar called Yawn. Alster has pointed out in many books that he's written on the subject. Actually marks is an individualist because if you look at how he defines classes, he defines them by reference to the way in which the, the, the, the way in which individuals relate to the means of production. So what is it that makes you work in class as opposed to a member of the capitalist laws? What makes you working cause is if you have to sell your labor power to somebody else in order to live. So if you want to know where the somebody is working class, you say, does he have to sell his labor power to somebody else in order to live or not?

Speaker 1:          10:18          If the answer is yes, he's working class, the answer is no, he's not working class. So you might say, hmm, well I have, you know, I ha I have to come in here and work every day to get paid my salary. I have to sell my labor to the university in that sense, but I don't, I'm not working class you. You might think, you know, somebody else might tell me I'm working plus, but they can speak for themselves. You know, I, I drive a nice car. I live in the suburbs, I'm not working class. Um, Mark's, his answer is to appeal to this distinction being between a class in itself and a class for itself. The answer is Shapiro. You had just diluted, you might think you are not working class. But that's because you don't understand your objective position in the division of Labor. You are working class whether you understand it or not.

Speaker 1:          11:21          And that's a class I'm working class in a class in itself since I'm not working class in the class for itself if I don't believe that I'm working class. So the in itself represents the objective division definition of plus the four itself is the subjective okay. Where the people actually believe that working class and perceive themselves to be working class. But what matters for the, for the uh, movement of history is the in itself what's ultimately going to drive everything is the logic, the object of logic, of class conflict, not the subjective logic of what people think is their position in the social division of Labor. So, um, it's important to keep those two things separate. Now marks, as I've already said, was a utopian thinker and he does ultimately want to say for reasons that that I'll get into later today and more and more depth on Monday. He does ultimately want to say that what differentiates a communist revolution from all previous revolutions is that these two things will become synonymous. That for the first time in history,

Speaker 1:          12:45          the working class in four itself, we'll come to see it self as the working class in itself. We will understand our objective position in the division of labor and self consciously create the new order. Whereas in all previous modes of production, people don't really understand their position and the object of scheme of things and so they create orders as invisible hands. To go back to Adam Smith's term, they create orders as byproducts of their intended activities, not as products of their intentional design. And so that's, that's that distinction between in itself and for itself. Now you might listen to all of this and you could say, wow,

Speaker 2:          13:34          yeah,

Speaker 1:          13:35          it's a kind of quaint 19th century idea, but it doesn't have much to do with the white people live in the world today. After all, as we have all noticed with great intensity and the past year and a half of the financial crisis. Many people who work for wages

Speaker 2:          13:57          yeah

Speaker 1:          13:58          also have money in the stock market. Well, but then they're capitalists aren't they? Because stock is capital. So you know, I have my retirement money and my Tia Cref has college professors get it in the stock market. So I'm an owner of capital as well as a worker. And this sort of, um, binary distinction between the working class and the capitalist class. Just it, it just too simple minded. What do you think Marx would say to that?

Speaker 2:          14:32          Anybody? Any takers?

Speaker 1:          14:38          I'm not really working class because you know, I've got, I've got money and I, you know, I have stocks and vested in all kinds of things. Mutual funds, no. So I'm not really working for us any, anyone think what marks might say to that? Not, not easy.

Speaker 1:          15:01          I think that what he would say is this, he'd say, well, the definition of working class is that you have to work for somebody else in order to live. Not that you choose to work for somebody else in order to lab. So if I have enough money in my Tia craf invested in the stock market that I can quit tomorrow and do just fine, then I'm not working class. So it's, it's this element of compulsion that makes you working five. So it doesn't, it's not important from Marxists point of view that some of us might own stocks, but if we really owned enough stock that we would, if we were not in this position of having to work for somebody else in order to live, we wouldn't be working class. And so people could move in and out of the working class. Indeed. I know people on the Yale Faculty who two years ago we're about to retire and live off their accumulated Tia craf and then it went up in smoke when, uh, when the wheels came off the economy and now they're not retiring. So what Marx would say, where's while they managed to get out of the working class in theory in principle, but then they fell back down into the working class. So it's, it's this element of compulsion. They're not retiring because they don't have enough and therefore they have to work for somebody else in order to live. So that's the distinction between a class in itself and a class for itself that drives his theory. Okay. So what is the theory?

Speaker 2:          16:43          Okay,

Speaker 1:          16:44          we're back to lock those of you who read chapter five of the second treaties carefully. When we looked at Locke and his theory of property saw how for Locke, the workmanship ideal plays out in the economic realm with the proposition that most of the value of our product comes from work. Very crude in lock. At one point he says, you know, 90% of it comes from work. The rest is natural resources. At another point he says 99% of it comes from work. The rest is natural resources. Um, but he locked doesn't really have any mechanism by which labor supposedly creates value. And in the 17th and 18th century, there were really three theories floating around. There were, as I think I mentioned to you on Monday, there were in, in Europe, particularly France, the physiocrats who said value comes from the land, but there were English theorist who looked at them and said, no, that can't be right because look how rich hollandaise and they don't have a lot of land. And so they thought value came from trade. But then the third group starting in the 17th century with Hobbes, so William Petty Locke and others said, no value comes from work. That source of value is work. And that's what Mark's picks up on in trying to develop a theory of value.

Speaker 1:          18:22          And his theory is more refined than locks, more fine than smiths and more refined than Ricardo's. It starts with this idea of socially necessary labor time or smelled, and he'd defines smelt as the labor time required to produce any use value. Remember what anyone remind us, what is a use value? Monday's lecture. What's a yes? Yes. Is it useful? Right? So anything with utility is a use value, right? So it's the amount of labor time required to produce any use value under the conditions of production. Normal for a given society and with the average degree of skill and intensity of the labor prevalent in the society. So let's suppose lay on it and I are making typewriters.

Speaker 2:          19:29          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          19:29          One of the big sort of conundrums of labor theories of value had been, well what if, what if Lillian is a perfectionist and he spends twice as long making his typewriter as I spend making my typewriter.

Speaker 2:          19:45          But

Speaker 1:          19:46          you know, most of the perfectionisms action his own head because at the end of the day they're the same.

Speaker 2:          19:53          MMM.

Speaker 1:          19:54          Marx would say he wouldn't, he would not say lay on his typewriter was worth twice Shapiro's type by it because he put twice as much labor into it. No, because half of his Labor would be socially unnecessary. So it's, it's socially necessary labor time or if a new labor saving device was created so that the keys could be made much more quickly, then we are laborious doing it with file and I use the new machine, the labor saving device and lay on it doesn't. So my type artists get produced more quickly. His type art not going to sell for more than my typewriter because again, he's using socially unnecessary labor. So that's the notion of the average degree of skill, intensity of labor prevalent in the society at the time. So, um, that's what's going to determine the value of commodities. The long term, remember we talked about the, the natural value, the long term equilibrium price of a commodity is going to be determined by the amount of labor power that is socially necessary to produce it. And this idea of socially necessary includes everybody working at the same or an average intensity. And it includes using available technologies because if some use them and others don't, those who don't are going to be um,

Speaker 1:          21:32          deploying unnecessary labor time. And that's not going to be reflected in the value of the product because in a competitive market, the most cheaply priced commodity is going to beat. The other sound important to remember, Mark's works for the model of a perfectly competitive economy,

Speaker 2:          21:52          okay?

Speaker 1:          21:53          Right? In which equivalence exchange for equivalent, no cheating. I mentioned that on Monday, okay. A perfectly, his model is a perfectly competitive economy. At least at the beginning. He's got a view about how economies evolve over time to become uncompetitive and we'll get to that. But initially, and then his analytic story in a competitive economy, the most cheaply produced products are going to drive out the last cheaply produced. And so it's socially necessary labor time, not average, not actual. Doesn't matter how much blood, sweat and tears Leon aid actually uses. Um, what counts is how much he knew he, she needs to use. Okay? So that you could say, okay, but, but that's not the beginning of the whole story. And to get into that, we have to go a step further with marks and look not just at the labor theory of value, but the labor theory of surplus value. This is where the rubber meets the road for marks. What he wants to say is living human labor power is the only source of fresh value. I've exchanged value. So this is the workmanship, IDL on crack. Okay. Living Human Labor power is the only source of fresh value.

Speaker 1:          23:27          So when Locke said, you know, work is 90%, uh, or maybe it's 99% of the value of commodities and the rest commerce from the common locks, um, Mark's just going to say it's 100% all exchange value comes work and why he's thinking of here, it's two things. One is he wants to say, if you, if you look at all the commodities that are produced in an, in a market economy, the one thing they all have in common is that that products of human work.

Speaker 2:          24:16          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          24:17          It's the, it's the single common denominator, right?

Speaker 2:          24:26          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          24:28          It is. The capacity to work is a commodity like any other, so that we'll, we'll get into this in more detail in a minute. But when you think about what it is that people are paid, what is it that a worker is paid? It's determined like the value of any other commodity. So when we say what is the value of a buck, it's determined by the amount of labor power necessary to produce that book. And when we say what is the value of a steelworker, it's determined by the amount of labor power necessary to produce that steelworker. The workers are commodity and justice. Same sense as the book is a commodity. So wages are determined by the costs of producing the worker. And the reason a physicist gets paid more than a manual labor, then it's simple. It costs more to produce the physicist, then it could cost to produce the manual labor. All the training and education and so on that goes into their physicists costs more than the training and education that goes into the producing a manual labor. So wages are not explained by the value of what the workup produces. This is one of the things people often get wrong. Values I explained by the cost of producing the worker.

Speaker 1:          26:03          I'll say that again. It's important. Wager is wages are explained not by the value of what the workup produces, but rare that by the cost of producing the worker. So why do you think of that? Why would somebody say somebody who thought this is, what would mark say about, why is that Michelangelo Painting Worth so much? Well, why does it, why does a professional baseball get tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of dollars if this is true? Anyone think about, I think of what Marx would say.

Speaker 2:          26:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          27:00          Anyone want to guess?

Speaker 2:          27:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          27:05          Yeah. What do you say? It's because like how much time they had to practice and how much, uh, like money and time they put into learning their skills. That would be part of it. But still, you know, I mean there are only so many hours in a day. How do you get up to $100 million salary? Uh, it's, it's uh, I mean, you're on the right track. Any, what else goes into the creation of a major league baseball player? Why don't they have very good major league baseball players and Brit,

Speaker 2:          27:44          okay,

Speaker 1:          27:45          it's, they don't have minor leagues. They don't have farm teams that there's huge costs associated with getting the one brilliant best of all time player. So that's what he would have to say. Or if you think about the value, the value of a Michelangelo painting, it's not just the training of Michelangelo, it's all those failed painters that all those popes wasted all that money investing in. But that all goes in in some indirect sense into the, um, into the wage differential. So that's sort of what it's of course, if it is a stretch. And one thing that marks did not think about, mmm, was what we call in in economics today, winner take all markets. Anyone know what a winner take all market is? Once a winner take all market, what is, what does the phrase suggest to you? What, what do you think a winner take all market should be?

Speaker 1:          29:05          Think about the wage differential between the major leagues and Minor League Baseball is huge, right? That's a winner take all market. The way you can think about it is, um, before the advent of the gramophone record being a really pretty good opera singer could, um, you could have, you'd do pretty well. Every major city would have, you know, an opera with a pretty good opera singer. I'd make a good living. Why don't you have the gramophone record? Then everybody can buy Pavarotti, right? So then whether or not the d the difference between Pavarotti and the next best and third best opera singer, um, becomes much more important. So that's the idea of a winner take all market. Um, and, and Mark's had nothing to say about them, so he would have to reach for this rather contorted logic of saying it. It just costs much more to produce, um, the best baseball player in the world.

Speaker 1:          30:13          Um, because you have to run everything that goes into that production, not his own, not only his own practicing and training, but everything that goes with it. So that's the first point. Labor power is a commodity and it's exchange value, which price is determined by what it costs to produce it. But then this is the magic. This is the workmanship ideal on crack. This is the idea. He wants to say that living human labor power is a unique commodity in that it's consumption as a use value leads to the creation of fresh exchange value. What does this mean? It means that suppose I have some money and I spend, you know, $1,000 on a wonderful meal, good wine,

Speaker 2:          31:14          okay.

Speaker 1:          31:15          At the end of that meal, you know I, it's gone, right? The thought I paid the check and it's gone, I've consumed it. Whereas if I had spent that thousand dollars hiring one of you to paint one wall in my home, when it's done, my home's worth something more because it has freshly painted wall. That's what he means. Okay? So that living human labor power differs from other commodities in that W it's consumption as a use value leads to the creation of fresh exchange value, right? You eat the meal, it's gone, but you consume the labor power of the person painting your house or the person working in your factory and it's not gone right in it. I mean the labor power gone in the sense that it's been expanded, those calories have been spent, but you have something in a greater value. I have a house that's worth more than it was before you hired that person to paint it. And that's what makes Labor power unique, right? And it is. He wants to say it is the only source of fresh value. Okay. So a couple of just terms here to get straight his archaic language,

Speaker 1:          32:47          you probably read, he makes a distinction between what he calls constant capital and variable capital, all of that or what oil you need to think about. There is, um, capital is what the capitalist spends in the productive process. Variable capital is wages and constant capitalist. Everything else, sometimes he uses these symbols. C means all capital. Big C means all capital. Little c means everything the capitalist spends on things other than wages and V is spent on wages and why he might call it variable. So the idea is that wages are always driven toward subsistence.

Speaker 1:          33:37          This is, uh, an empirical assumption. Mark's makes a few empirical assumptions of all the empirical assumptions he makes. This is the one that actually is the most accurate. He wants to say that there are always some unemployed in capitalist economies and because there are always some unemployed in capitalist economies, wages will be driven towards subsistence. Because if you have, say a union that organizes and drives up wages, the employer will then go and hire nonunion workers and say, well, will you work for me at subs at something lower than the union wage? And the answer will be yes because the unemployed worker won't have a choice. Okay, so wages of B will be driven towards subsistence. Now that puts on the table another question. Well, what is subsistence?

Speaker 2:          34:35          Okay,

Speaker 1:          34:35          what is subsistence? And and Mark's does say, well it has a social and historical element. So that is to say, you know, in a society like ours, the definition of subsistence might include having enough money to buy a car in order to drive to work. Whereas obviously that was not true in 19th century Britain. So what counts as subsistence changes? And we will see there are other features of, of Marx's theory of capitalism which show that this actually an belt impetus for the what's constant subsistence to go up. But at any given time, the accepted level of subsistence and wages will be driven toward that because of the existence of what he flamboyantly described as the reserve army of the unemployed. Right. That's what keeps wages at subsistence or close to it in a competitive economy. Okay.

Speaker 2:          35:38          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          35:43          Let's do a little micro transaction. Suppose there's a working day. Okay. And suppose the ex the accepted working days, 10 hours long, mark says, well think about what the worker is doing. The work as you know, is producing cotton. Let's say it doesn't really matter what. And for some portion of that working day, the cotton that is producing wine eventually sold is going to cover the cost of his wages.

Speaker 1:          36:25          So the workup produces cotton all day long. But the, and the capitalist eventually sells the cotton right and get something for it. And then he's gotta pay. His worker is wage. And we're just going to say for the purposes of this example, the, the work that's done in the first four hours is going to cover the wage bill. And the rest is, is what Marx calls surplus. So that's the difference between necessary and surplus labor time. And Mark's has the eye, do you have a rate of exploitation, which is the ratio of national, sorry, day surplus labor time. You could even make an little index. And so you'd say it's 1.5. Okay. So this is the capitalists, the, the value that's produced that covers the wage bell. This is the wreck. Of course, this is an all profit, right? Why isn't it profit? Why isn't all of that profit? Somebody think about it. You're a capitalist. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          37:36          Cause somebody goes to the actual, I guess building where they're working or other, um, or even material needed to

Speaker 1:          37:43          exactly. The Kappa Sas to buy raw material. It's to do advertising, has to run as to have a system of managers, um, uh, you know, research and development. All of that has to be paid out of this. So profit is, you know, some subset of this, but it's not all of this. Okay. So, okay, so we're in the cotton business and it's a competitive business. And so another cotton manufacturer says, you know what? I think these work is a slacking. I'm an essay from now on to my workers. You work 11 hours.

Speaker 2:          38:25          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          38:26          wages are ready at subsistence by assumption, right? So you know, the workers might no or not, and they say it can say goodbye, I'll get somebody's unemployed to do it then. Okay. So,

Speaker 2:          38:43          okay,

Speaker 1:          38:44          if you do that, we now have an 11 hour working day. The rate of exploitation goes up, right? Because now there's seven hours of surplus labor rather than six hours of surplus labor. You now you might say, well, the workers going to get worn out sooner and die, uh, sooner. We'll edge. That's just suspend disbelief about that and say, in fact, so this, this capitalist is going to do better than this capitalist. So this capital is going to be able to sell his or her product more cheaply and therefore this capital is going to be in trouble. Paypal. Thank you know, Marxism capitalists are afraid of the working class. No. On Marcia's theory, who is a capitalist if radar, who is the capitalists looking over his shoulder rock?

Speaker 1:          39:48          Yeah, the capitalist down the street. Not, they couldn't care less about. It's not worried about the workers. He's worried about the capitalists who can come into his industry and produce more effectively. Okay. So if you can, if you can make these workers work an extra hour, you're going to do it and then everybody else is going to have to do it, right? Or they're going to go on our business. And this is why Mark's wants to say this is what he calls an increase in absolute, a surplus value. This is why mark says under primitive capitalism now, early stages of capitalism, the battles are going to be over things like the length of the working day. If any of you have done 19th century British history, you will know that one of the big battles started. This starts with the charters and the early 19th century. Uh, and goes on. What are they pushing for the 10 hours bell? They want the 10 hours bill. They want parliament to come in and say working days, 10 hours to limit this. So to the extent that the workers can organize politically and put pressure to get a 10 hours bell, then you, you, you limit this. But in any case, Mark's wants to say, you know, there are only so many hours in a day and people do have to sleep after all, so you're not going to get much, much out of this. The real secret to capitalism's dynamism,

Speaker 1:          41:25          it's not the move from a to B, it's the move from a to c. Notice here we're back at a 10 hours

Speaker 2:          41:34          a day, but now by assumption I'm saying

Speaker 1:          41:40          the capitalist is going to cover his wage bell for that worker in three hours. We had an for. How's it going to do that?

Speaker 2:          41:48          Yeah, pardon?

Speaker 1:          41:53          But you can't reduce wages because wages are already at subsistence. So you're going to have to buy assumption. You, you have to produce the same, you have to pay the same wages. So how are you going to do it? Technology. Exactly. The name of the game is technology. Somebody's going to go and buy a spinning Jenny and put it in his factory, and then the workers will work way more productively. And as a result of that, the capitalists will cover his wage bill more quickly.

Speaker 2:          42:34          Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:35          And of course the minute one capitalist puts the spinning Jenny in, everybody has to put the Spinning Jenny yet, right? Or else they're to go out of business because the capitalists that's covering his wage, Bellin, three hours of that work as work rather than four. It's going to be able to sell a cotton more cheaply in the market and therefore out outcompete the capitalist who still still using the old system. And so the way capitalism works is that there's constant pressure for technological innovation because the, this is not a very effective way of increasing productivity, right? You can, in the early stages, you'll see that by the old there'll be political limits, 10 hours bill, there'll be natural limits, human capacity. So then all the pressure is on dynamic innovation. Okay? Now,

Speaker 2:          43:34          okay,

Speaker 1:          43:37          this is where it gets interesting because what he wants to say is, but we know that only living human labor power producer's surplus value. So as, as you become more and more capital intensive, the capitalist is spending more and more on the constant capital unless a nice on variable capital to put it in modern jargon production is becoming more capital intensive. You spending more and more of your, of your investment

Speaker 2:          44:14          on

Speaker 1:          44:15          something that does not produced new value. So another way you can think about this, um, and this, remember I said to you last time, all the classical political economists thought they had to explain the declining tendency and the rate of what Mark's wants to say is,

Speaker 2:          44:37          okay,

Speaker 1:          44:37          if this is the status quo, okay? And one capitalist in the cotton industry puts in the spinning Jenny and this becomes the status quo. This capitalist will have higher profits than this capitalist, right? But once they've all put in the spinning Jenny, the rate of profit in the cotton industry will be lower than it was up here. Okay, so there's a, there's a short run, long run conflict of interest for capitalist because in the short run at the margin I will innovate and my profits will go up, but then everybody will copy me and the, the rate of profit in the cop caught an industry will fall over time. Now there's, that's us, there's some dubious assumptions in that which I'm going to come back to, um, on Monday. But I first want to just draw your attention to some of the normative aspects of this. What Marx calls the rate of exploitation, as I said, is the ratio of surplus to necessary labor time.

Speaker 1:          45:47          But now look down the right hand side here. What these got all this is con this jargon, but you can unpack it here. Sov is the rate of exploitation and it's all these things are basically equivalent ratio. But look down here and now think about this. Suppose I was a capitalist and you were a worker working for me. Okay? And suppose I said Time's a tough in the cotton industry, you've got a choice. We can go to here or we can go to here. We can pick B, uh, we can pick C, but a is no longer an option. A means I'm moving to Mexico can, can't do a anymore. So take your pick B or c. How many are you going to take? Pick B. Hands up. How many gonna Pick C. Okay, everybody. But then it seems like this is very counterintuitive, doesn't it? Because

Speaker 2:          46:58          mm.

Speaker 1:          46:58          You all went for something that according to Marx has a higher rate of exploitation. 2.33 as opposed to 1.75.

Speaker 2:          47:12          Okay.

Speaker 1:          47:14          How can that be? How can that make any sense? Okay. And I'm just gonna tell you, I'm going to go two minutes over here to leave you with this to think about, and then we'll pick up with it on Monday. This is the,

Speaker 1:          47:32          there's a, but if you, if you think about how people, how people think about how well off they are, the parade oh system says, am I m I on a higher or lower indifference curve than I was on before? It's a bit like when Ronald Reagan was running for lead reelection in 1984. His slogan was, are you better off than you war? Who were four years ago? Right? You look at your situation and you say, what was my situation? Is it better? Is it worse? Self referential comparison. Mark says, no, that's not the relevant comparison. The relevant comparison is other referential. You decide how well off you are, not just by reference to what you get compared to with what you got before, but what by reference to what others are getting. So that in this kind of situation if you say which is worse for the worker, they may well say that a situation in which they have more is worse than a situation then which they have less if the capitalist has even more so. Mark's wants to say we're inherently other referential. What are we going to make us more or less happy? It's not just what we have but what we have in relation to others. So now, and it turns out on this matter, he was half right.

Speaker 2:          49:02          Okay.

Speaker 1:          49:03          He was half right. We see from huge number a hundred years of studies of of sociology. What people find acceptable and desirable is connected to what others have. But usually it's connected. And this is where he was half wrong. It's usually collected to what people who are similarly situated to themselves have. So work is in the steel industry, will compare themselves to work as in the auto industry, but work is in the auto industry while not compare themselves to what executives in the auto industry yet. So people are other referential but in a more horizontal sense. And this is true up and down the occupational scale. So if you have been an it and yell administrator, one thing you will learn is it will matter much more to a professor. If he or she learns he's being paid $2,000 less than the professor down the corridor.

Speaker 1:          50:12          Then if he or she learns his pain, he or she is being paid $200,000 less than the attorney who lives next door to them. People compare themselves to others, but they compare themselves to similarly others. Why that is is uh, immensely complicated and interesting subject, but it means that Marx was right to think we're basically other referential. We don't just ask the question, has my utility who have gone up or down? We do. We do compare ourselves to others, but he was, he was mistaken in thinking that we would compare that work has, would compare themselves to capitalists rather than to other workers in deciding whether or not they were well off, and that would feed into his assumptions about the conditions under which workers would be likely to become militant. Okay. We'll start with that issue on Monday.
