Speaker 1:          00:01          This morning we're going to begin making the transition from the classical utilitarian doctrine of Jeremy Bentham's to the neoclassical doctrine that was championed by a number of different figures in the late 19th and early 20th century. And we're going to end up by focusing on John Stuart Mill, um, as the principal expository of neoclassical utilitarianism. And where are we headed is for a doctrine that I'm going to call the right utility synthesis, the reits utilities synthesis signals that we're looking for an attempt to put together both a commitment too, utilitarian efficiency that's grounded in science and on the one hand and respect for individual rights that's grounded in the workmanship ideal. On the other hand, and we're not going to actually get to the reits utilities synthesis as it's expressed in politics by John Stuart Mill until next Monday. What instead I'm going to do today is explain how the, the transition from classical to neoclassical utilitarianism, um, really went on in all fields of thinking about the human sciences at more or less the same time.

Speaker 1:          01:29          There were developments in Pol political theory that we're going to talk about at considerable length, but there will also, um, undergirding that developments in economics and in philosophy that are going to be my principal focus in today's lecture. What you're also going to get as a byproduct of today's lecture is everything you ever needed to know about neoclassical economics in 45 minutes. That is to say a neoclassical economics is a brilliant intellectual creation to a large extent the creation of bill freight out Pareto, an Italian economist that I'm going to talk about today. Um, but with the important contributions from other figures in the modern history of economics such as Marshall a and, w I'm going to, uh, it's mentioned in some detail and economist called Edgeworth and they developed a system of, of, of thinking about economics and the theory of value that was going to be tremendously influential and important.

Speaker 1:          02:36          Um, not only in the way utilitarianism involved, but in the way of our thinking about markets. Legitimacy and distributive justice would evolve at the same time, more or less. There were very important developments in moral philosophy that I just want to alert you to, that we're going to return to later when we come to consider Alistair McEntire's book after virtue. And this, um, movement in philosophy that I'm, I'm mentioning here is the doctrine that would come to be called emotive Islam. It was associated with a man by the name of Stephenson, uh, who, who wrote several books advocating the emotive as doctrine, uh, when he was an untenured professor in the Yale philosophy department as a byproduct of which he never became a tenured professor in the Yale Philosophy Department because his doctrine was thought to be so repugnant. His doctrine was that when we make claims like murder is wrong, um, we are making claims that express our emotions are emotive reactions to propositions.

Speaker 1:          03:57          Just as when we say, I like ice cream or I prefer chocolate ice cream to strawberry ice cream, all we're doing is expressing our tastes, our emotional reactions, and that there is nothing more to say about ethics than that. Now you could say this, this emotive as doctrine is a, an end point in an philosophical evolution that really begins in the 17th century. Hobbs who I mentioned to you in a very first lecture criticized Aristotle for not seeing as Hobbes thought that what is desirable for some people is not desirable for others. Um, but Hobbs didn't truth be told, take that view that seriously because he thought for the most part, we're all pretty much the same. And if you look at the other classical utilitarians like, um, um, David Hume who were not reading in this course, but we could read in this course or Sidgwick who were not reading in this course, but we could have read in this course.

Speaker 1:          05:08          They also basically thought human beings were more or less all alike in their psychological structure, in their basic human needs. Human has a famous line somewhere to the effect that if all factual questions were resolved, no moral questions would remain. If all factual questions were resolved, no moral questions would remain. And it's not that human thought. We could derive an ort statement from an is Hume's famous for the idea that an ort cannot be derived from an is that there's a fact value problem. Um, but he, he thought nonetheless, people are pretty much the same. And so if you can figure out what makes one of them check, you can figure out what makes all of them tick. And that was most emphatically Jeremy Bentham's view. Uh, it's opposed in everything we discussed last time. If you think about the idea of doing interpersonal comparisons of utility, um, and making the judgment that taking that dollar from Donald Trump and giving it to the bag lady increases her utility more than it decreases his, you're assuming that they basically all have the same kinds of utility functions.

Speaker 1:          06:29          Stevenson questioned that idea radically. He said, we don't actually know. We should take obs much more seriously in his critique of Aristotle then he was willing to take himself. We don't actually know if people have the same kinds of utility functions. We don't know whether or not what makes some people happy will make others happy as well. And so Stevenson was thought to be a proponent of a kind of moral relativism because he linked ethics to our desires and preferences, any emotions and nothing else. And then he said, it's actually an open question. Stevenson was criticizing Hume on this point, but he might as well have been criticizing Hobbs or Bentham. Stephen's had said it's an open question whether people are like in their basic psychological structures in there, in there the physiology of their human needs. And so that was thought to be a radically relativist doctrine because it, it seemed to undermine the possibility of making, um, ethical judgements of any sword across people.

Speaker 1:          07:46          That is a doctrine to which we will return. As I said, when we get to, uh, the Anti Enlightenment and in particular Alistair McEntire's book after virtue. But today we're going to focus for the rest of our time on the economics of the transition from classical to neoclassical utilitarianism. And I'm going to ask you to suspend disbelief for the rest of today's lecture and just trust me. Because what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into this backwards. I'm going to come into the transition from classical to neoclassical economics. Um, by looking at a very different problem that the neoclassical economists were concerned with that had nothing to do with utilitarianism or rights will anything that we've been talking about in this lecture. And it's not until you get to the end of this narrative that you will start to see why the transition from classical to neoclassical utilitarianism in economics was essential for the transition in political theory and indeed for the transition in moral philosophy.

Speaker 1:          09:03          So, uh, as I said, you're going to have to suspend your disbelief and just follow me through the ABC of neoclassical price theory, which is what we're going to do now. And as I said, the bow, the bonus here, the byproduct is you're going to get the whole of econ one o one reduced to a single lecture because indeed it is true that enormously complex and subtle and sophisticated as the neo classical theory of micro economics is, it's all belt out of three ideas. It's all built out of the three ideas that I'm going to spell out for you, uh, in what some of you might initially go regardless, laborious and detail. Um, but I'm gonna do it anyway. Uh, and I think you'll see what I'm getting at. Um, once we get towards the end of today's discussion, so

Speaker 1:          10:06          imagine a single person, we're going to call them a as testimony to my lack of imaginative invest, but you could call them anything you like. Um, and let's imagine a world in which they're just two commodities in this guy's wine and bread. The system of neoclassical utilitarianism invented by Paredo says that other things being equal, you want more rather than less. Um, any source of utility, right? We know that from classical utilitarianism. Um, but if you have, if you have six bottles of wine and only one loaf of bread bread is comparatively more valuable to you than wine, so that you would exchange a lot of wine to get a second loaf of bread. If on the other hand, uh, you would choking on your six loaves of bread and dying of thirst, uh, the, the reverse would be true and you would be, you would give up a lot of bread in order to get a small amount of wine and these, these are what are called indifference curves and neoclassical economics and indifference curves basically imply exactly as the name suggests that you would be indifferent among the mixes of bread and wine anywhere on this curve.

Speaker 1:          11:39          And this curve is always shaped that way. Concave toward the origin. Anybody wanting to tell us why somebody who, what is it reflecting, why is it, why is it that shape?

Speaker 1:          11:54          Someone who's done an econ class or somebody who remembers Monday's lecture? Yeah. Yes. Okay. It reflects the idea of diminishing marginal utility reflects the idea of diminishing marginal utility in exactly the sense that I just said that if you have a huge amount of bread, the next loaf of bread is less valuable to you at the margin. Then the previous loaf of bread was, so if you've got a lot of bread, you'll give up a lot of brand in all the order to get a small amount of wine. Okay? So that is the idea of diminishing marginal utility. And when, when we call this what I've labeled here, I won and indifference curve, we were saying literally you would get the same amount of utility no matter where you were on that curve. So if you have one of, we have here, this isn't very well drawn, but uh, say four bottles of wine and two loaves of bread, you would be equally happy as if you had, um, what does it look like?

Speaker 1:          13:03          Have four loaves of bread and, and one and a quarter bottle of wine. You would be equally happy between those two distributions. Okay. What would increase your happiness? What would increase your happiness would be to get onto a higher indifference curve. If you could have more bread and more wine, of course you'd be happier. Right? And so the idea of of indifference curves is that you want to go this way, you want and go from p toward cue. You want to get onto, as they put it in the jargon of neoclassical theory, you want to get onto as high an indifference curve as you can possibly get. So you're this, and this is for those of you who like the jargon, this would be a utility function. You want to get up, go up your utility function, all the way to Q. If you could, we don't know where Q is out in the, uh, in the stratosphere, but any, wherever you were on your utility function, you could draw one of these curves through it.

Speaker 1:          14:07          In principle, you could, you could find, so if you know, if you were here, you could find the mix of bread and wine in each instance among which you're going to be indifferent. So that is the notion of an indifference curve. Now, an important consideration in the theory of indifference curves was to say that we don't know, I've, I've put these equally apart, but in a way I shouldn't have because it's misleading. If you get from one to two and then you get from two to three you haven't increased your utility necessarily by the same amount. These distances don't mean anything. Okay. I could have put three right here

Speaker 1:          15:00          because the system of neoclassical utilitarianism, unlike the system of classical utilitarianism, works with ordinal scales, ordered all mathematical styles and as the word implies, it means all we do is rank order. We rank order our preferences, but the we, we don't say anything more. So this individual a prefers 43 three to two and two to one but we can't say that he prefers was she prefers four to three more than she prefers three to two. We don't know that. We don't have a cardinal scale. Remember that in Bentham system we had cardinal scales. We were thinking of sort of lumps of utility that could be picked up and moved around and we it to people, right? The neoclassical economists didn't want to do that and they didn't want to do that for a different, a different reason than anything I've talked about in these lectures. They didn't want to do that because they were actually concerned with a quiet another problem. The problem they wanted to solve was to understand the behavior of markets.

Speaker 1:          16:16          They want it to be able to more precisely to predict what prices we're going to be in markets and they wanted to do that for reasons. I'm going to elaborate too much later on when we come and talk about Marx and the Labor theory of value and its its limitations. Um, but that that's for a future lecture. For today's lecture, all you need to concern yourself with is the fact that they want it to be able to understand the nature of markets of how market prices move, but they want it to be able to do this

Speaker 1:          16:53          with as little information as possible. They realized that for Bentham system to work, for example, the government would have to have a kind of utility tolmatter and run around and sticking it out into people's tongues to measure their utility, right? Very intrusive ad you need a lot of information to do Bentham system. They want it to say, how can we develop a well articulated theory of market prices based on as little information about people and their preferences as possible and Paredo and Marshall and Edgeworth and others who are in their circle thought you could do this just with ordinal utility. So moving from cardinal to ordinal utility is going to turn out to have huge ideological consequences which I'm going to for you, uh, towards the end of today's lecture. But as an analytic matter, looking at this from the inside, it had the, the great virtue of the providing the building blocks for a theory of price behavior in market systems that required almost no information about people. All we would know about this person a as I said, is that they prefer four to three, three to two to two, one, one, two, zero. But we can't say anything about how much they prefer those things because these distances don't actually mean anything. All we get is an ordered ranking. Now there is one other thing we can say. One other thing we can say,

Speaker 2:          18:45          okay

Speaker 1:          18:46          is that this is a no, no. These indifference curves cannot cross. Can anybody tell us why? Why can't they cross?

Speaker 2:          19:05          Wait for the mic?

Speaker 3:          19:08          Because at the intersection they should have the same utility even though they're different in different indifference curves.

Speaker 1:          19:16          So what would happen if, what would be what? What, what's, what's the problem with, I mean you're on the right track and what's the problem with that crossing?

Speaker 3:          19:24          Because you say I too as utility of two I 2.5 as utility of two point by, but at that point where they intersect, they both have to have the same utility.

Speaker 1:          19:37          So you've got a kind of contradiction on your hands, is that right? Yeah. Okay. And just just to spell out the contradiction more emphatically, I think you basically made the point if we're saying that we're in different, among all of the things on this curve and we're in different, among all the things on this curve, we can't, we can't have a cross because then we're saying here, right? 2.5 is preferred to two, but here we're saying the opposite. We're saying two is preferred to 2.5 okay. The jargon. Anybody just happen to know, yell it out. We don't need the mic. Does anybody know that jargon for this France activity? The preferences, I was assumed to be transferred in. So if you prefer a two B and B to c, you must prefer a to z. That's all that transit. That means, okay, if you prefer a two B and B two c, it must be the case that you also prefer a to see. Otherwise you're contradicting the principle of transitivity. Okay? So we cannot have these indifference curves crossing one another.

Speaker 1:          20:58          Now what we're going to do here instead of one person and two commodities, we're going to think about two people, okay? We're putting, we're creating a diagram with two people on it. And this is I say as I promised you earlier in the semester, anything I do with a diagram I will also do verbally. So if you find this in any way confusing, um, just listen to their narrative and then we'll see whether you get it that way. Um, but so now we have a diagram with two people on it. Okay? So this is person a and this is person B and these axes, the x axis here is A's utility function. Remember Aa and the previous slide was trying to get from Pete towards Q, right? Hey was trying to go up here. So this on this slide is the same thing as this on this slide. So A's trying to go this way and B is trying to go this way, okay? And what we imagine is some distribution of utility between them. So a has this much utility f if this is the status quo x, okay, hey has this master utility and B has this much, you tell them

Speaker 1:          22:28          ace, happy than be right.

Speaker 1:          22:33          Wrong. He's not, we don't know that A's happy than before. What I'm from what I just said, right? These distances don't mean anything, right? So, uh, it looks like A's happier than be, but that's misleading. If, if the different distances I've taken to imply in your mind that A's happy than be uh, this abuse yourself of that thought right away. Okay? So we have a distribution here, okay? Now what Paredo said, he said, let's draw a line north, south through the status quo, and let's draw a line east, west through the status quo. Okay? And we'll imagine that there's a finite source of utility that's called the Po. It's gets called in the ECON textbox the Predo possibility frontier. So there's not an infinite source of utility. Now paredo said, well, if we draw the north, south and the east west, we get four quadrants, we get this one, we get this one, we get this one, and then we get this one right. And what parade said is, well that's interesting because we can say different things about them. One thing we can say is if you go anywhere into the northeast quadrant, both of them are better off, right? So if we go from x to Y, we know a, as you tell it, he's gone up and we know bees you, Tony's gone up, right? We don't know by how much, but we know it's gone up. So that both better off. On the other hand, if we went in anywhere in here, this quadrant south west, as it were,

Speaker 1:          24:24          obviously that both better at worse off. Okay. Because if we, if I had put a point here, you know Q, well no, that's not used to Jay. Um, that's not you. Yeah. And let's use J by a point here, Jay. We would say that A's gone down. Ed Bee's gone down. Now to make this a bit more real, imagine in here, this is the sphere of market transactions. This is where a and B will go voluntarily, right? So A, we'll say to be, well I have all this wine and you have all that bread. How about I swap you a bottle of wine for a loaf of bread? And you're saying, okay, you give it to them. Both people are better off. Okay. And we know that both better off because they did it voluntarily and we know they're both trying to get onto is high and in different score as possible. Right? So they met, they swapped the wine, they swapped the bread and both of them are happier, a little more tipsy. But also a, a little, uh, a little better fat. Okay. Uh, move into here would be a ZF. The government taxes them both and uses the money to spend on, um, foreign aid to a country they both despise, let's say. So they both paid attacks and the money has gone to something they don't support.

Speaker 1:          25:59          We can say that's what, that, that's Paredo inferior, righto. Superior or righto inferior. Right. It's Baredo inferior because they both don't want it. And both of them would resist it if the government tried to do it. Obviously they wouldn't go there to a market transaction because it reduce, it puts both of them on a lower indifference curve. Okay. So that's all well and good. Well that leaves these two other quadrants and about those two quadrants, Pareto's says, we can say nothing at all. We can say nothing at all, at least nothing scientific. And then he says in his famous 700 page book called the manual of political economy, he says, people are going to misinterpret me. People are going to interpret me as saying we should never move into either of these quadrants. I'm not saying that, all I'm saying is we will never have a scientific reason for moving into either of these quadrants because if we were to move from x to g so that we took some, we tax a by that amount and we give it to be, we cannot say, we cannot say that bees gain is greater than A's loss because these distances don't mean anything. Despite where I put the G, we just have no way of knowing because we don't allow interpersonal comparisons of utility. And that's the link to the Stevenson in philosophy that I was talking to you about. Oh yeah. There's no way of knowing

Speaker 2:          28:03          weather, um,

Speaker 1:          28:08          B's loss is as big as a gain or the reverse because we can't make comparisons across individuals. There's no scientific way to do it. We can't assume with Bentham and with whom and with Sedgwick, we can't assume that everybody's basically the same. Perhaps they are. Perhaps they aren't, but we just don't know. Okay. So that is the Pareto principle. The paredo principle out of which the hall of neoclassical economic theory was constructed depends on this idea of indifference curves. People are trying to, a is trying to get up on those investments. Curb B is trying to get along on these difference curves. Um, and we have paredo superior, righto in Farrier and then these two, which he call Paredo undecidable because he can't decide, not because you're a [inaudible], but because there's no scientific way to tell whether in this case B's loss exceeds A's game. And if we went up here would be an analogous problem. Now if, let's just suppose we, we go back that a proposes to be swapping a loaf of bread for a bottle of wine and they be grazed. They go to y. And then I says, well, I'll give you another love red for another bottle of wine and basis forget it says, well come on, how about a half a bottle of wine? He says, okay, then they go to z.

Speaker 1:          29:51          Okay. And if, if, if they then get to a point at which no matter what swap a is willing to propose, B says no and no matter what, swap bean is willing to propose a says no. Then you know, they've hit that front here. What's called the Paredo possibility frontier, because now there's no way, there's no way to make be better off without making a worse off. Okay, so there won't this. They will. They will. What about half of Bob? What about a quarter of a bottle and then I want two thirds of alive. No, that's too much. Blah, blah, blah. Back and forth. But again, and I'm off. Okay. No transaction occurs. You know, they've hit that front yet. So the Paredo principle says that in a market system, they'll, they'll move toward the front tier and when they get there, they'll stop. Now of course, they may have gotten this somewhere else. They might've gone. They might say, they might have gone from x to two g over here, and then they would have done a new one and then they might've gone to here and so on. And that would just reflect shrewdness in bargaining or how much people can lower down there in different scrubs. Well are the idiosyncrasies, but once they wind up anywhere on this indifference curve, they're not going to move off of it

Speaker 1:          31:18          because now there's no way of improving one person's utility without diminishing the next person's utility. And that is what is called Paredo optimal. Okay. So why is Pareto superior to x and Z is Pareto optimal, can be improved upon. It's an optimum in that sense.

Speaker 2:          31:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:43          That's it. That is neoclassical economic theory in a nutshell. Now I'm going to show you one more diagram that, well, possibly look intimidating when I first put it up, but all it does is put the preceding diagrams that we've just looked at together.

Speaker 2:          32:07          Okay.

Speaker 1:          32:08          And this is, this is what's in the econ literature, uh, was invented by an economist called Edgeworth and it's called an Edgeworth box diagram. And let me explain it for you. Diagrammatically and then if anybody doesn't get it, we'll wait up and I'll go through it more slowly. But think about the, the, uh, diagram we just did. Okay. Think about a, a is in the corner. Okay. But, but basically now we're putting the two previous diagrams together. Maybe I'll just go back. So was everybody's clear what we're doing.

Speaker 1:          32:54          We're, we're putting this diagram where we have to commodities and one person and this diagram where we have two people on just utility, we're putting it all together into one big picture. And so this is the, you'll see why this is helpful. Uh, once we get to the end of it. So here a, once an ae has indifference curves, this is our first picture, right? So a is trying to go northeast, we have a, we have wine, we have bread. So if a is on this difference, curb the A's difference, indifference curves are the dotted lines. Okay. A is trying to get that way, that way, that way and keep going all that that way. Right? And what Edgeworth did, and this is I, it wasn't that I was a late night or anything, that I put this writing upside down. Um, he said, just imagine a mirror going down here. Be as coming at it from the other corner. Okay. So B is looking at bottles of wine, loves of bread, and B is now got this solid in different scarves. And be as trying to go this way, right? B is trying to go this way. So a would improve if he went this way and B would improve if she went this way.

Speaker 1:          34:28          Okay, so B, this is an, this is an indifference curve for B. Now it's going south west instead of north east. Just because it's looking in the mirror being as, hey, look in the mirror. Get it. Okay. So B wants to go this way. As I said, southwest a wants to go northeast. So if you imagine, um, if you imagine that this were the status quo from right where a has almost all of the bread, right? And B has almost all of the wine. Then this shaded area here, this big football is the parade. Oh, superior set on the previous diagram. Because if you think about it, it's the set that,

Speaker 2:          35:20          okay,

Speaker 1:          35:22          wherever, if you move anywhere in the biggest football, I've shaded here, like say we started, let's say we started here at ECS, wear a hat, all the, almost all the wine it'd be, had almost a, all of the bread.

Speaker 1:          35:38          Anything that like if they went from x to y, a would be on a higher indifference curve cause a would've gone from here to here and be coming the other way would also be on a hiring difference curve. And you could draw a new football, right? It would be a smaller football within the bigger football. And then they, they haggle again. And I says, well what about half a bottle of B says, well then I won three quarters of a love, blah, blah back and forth and they wind up at Z. And you know,Z is on the Pos Parade Possibility Front Kia, because every proposal that one makes the other rejects, right? And so you captured in an Edgeworth box by having their indifference curves be points of Tangency. So at z a wants to go this way, but the only way that a can go this way would move be off his or her indifference curve, which is this one coming this way. Okay. So all the Edgeworth box diagram just puts, puts all of the pictures together. There's no, nothing conceptually new in it at all. And it only becomes relevant to our purposes, um, because in, in a, in will enable us to start thinking about distributed questions, which I will get to in a minute. Okay.

Speaker 1:          37:21          Let me pause. Can I want to be sure if I'd gone through this too quickly? Would anyone like me to walk through it again? If you think you want me to walk through it again? Probably half the people in the room do so I don't feel

Speaker 2:          37:37          awkward.

Speaker 1:          37:38          It's actually a lot simpler than it looks, right? I mean, all you have to do is take the, the, the previous, the parade. Oh, principal. Um, the diagramming, imagine it with a mirror and think of B is upside down coming toward a, and then it just all fits together. Very clever. Okay. And the one thing I would say this line here,

Speaker 2:          38:09          okay.

Speaker 1:          38:10          Is One on the previous diagram was the Predo possibility frontier. Right. This line is all the points of tangency between

Speaker 2:          38:19          mmm.

Speaker 1:          38:21          Like there, there is one, you know, there is one.

Speaker 2:          38:26          MMM.

Speaker 1:          38:27          There is one. So you, you join up all the points, points at which the indifference curves are tangents. To one another. That is the line where if, if they get onto this line, they won't move off of it voluntarily. Right. By definition. So they got, they went from x to y to Z, but perhaps if they had gone, you know, if, if I'm a had driven a harder bargain early on, um, they might've gone, uh, by a different path and would've wound up at a different point. Um,

Speaker 2:          39:05          on the,

Speaker 1:          39:08          this, this is the parade. Oh, possibility frontier, which Edgeworth called the contract curve. It's the same thing. It's the, it's where they will make a contract to get to, they will agree to, um, they'll agree to transactions that get them onto that curve, but once they're on it, they stay there. Okay. That's the basic intuition. So market transactions into the Predo superior zone and eventually they stop when things are paredo optimal. Now let's think about comparing classical and neoclassical utilitarianism. If you think back to Monday's lecture we said with Bentham's utility.

Speaker 2:          39:59          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          40:00          Anything. This isn't a very good 45 degrees is it? I guess it is just depends where you stand with Bentham's utility. We said that anything, anything in this whole area, the first shaded area maximizes the greatest happiness of the greatest number, right? That's was his, um,

Speaker 2:          40:24          imperative.

Speaker 1:          40:26          The parado principle. We now know singles out this parade of superior area as unambiguously better because people will go there voluntarily. So, so everything that is parade, oh, superior is Bentham superior, right? Everything that's Paredo inferior is Bentham inferior, right? This is, this is uninteresting. It's unambiguously worse whether you're a classical or a neoclassical utilitarian, right? So everything that's Pereda superior is bent them superior, everything that's Predo inferior, it's bent them inferior. But now the interesting stuff, which is where all of redistributive politics goes on, and all the battles in politics go on are in the two Paredo undecidable quadrants, right? This one and this one about which Paredo says, as a matter of science, we can say nothing. And Bentham disagrees,

Speaker 2:          41:38          right?

Speaker 1:          41:39          Ben femmes principle by sex, these Paredo undecidable quadrants because Bentham makes his interpersonal judgments of utility. And so Bentham says, if you go into this area,

Speaker 2:          41:54          yeah,

Speaker 1:          41:54          it's a Bentham improvement though. It's Paredo undecidable. Whereas if you go into this area, it's not a Bantham improvement, even though it's Prorato undecidable. So Ben femmes and Sedgwick and you and the classical utilitarians think we can make interpersonal judgments, which allow us to say when it will make sense for the government to tax a and benefit B. Whereas Paredo says there's no way to tell. Again, he says people are going to interpret me as saying the government should never redistribute. I'm not saying that and it's a misuse of my doctrine to say that. All I'm saying is if the government chooses to redistribute, there's not going to be a scientific principle to tell them how. So just to make the point dramatic, let's suppose we've gone back to the address diagram. Let's suppose this is the status quo that is, let's suppose B has everything and a has nothing. He has all the wine and all the Bragg, we know they're on the contract curve because B has nothing that a once, right. So I have to thank again of Trump and the bag lady. She has nothing that he wants. So the parade efficient outcome is for the bag lady to start.

Speaker 1:          43:51          It might not be morally defensible, but it's the parade efficient outcome there on the contract curve. There is nothing you can do to improve the bag ladies utility that will not diminish Trump's utility

Speaker 2:          44:07          right

Speaker 1:          44:08          now you could say, but of course she's on the verge of starvation. How can that possibly be the case? But notice we've ruled out interpersonal comparisons of utility now and so proponents of neoclassical utilitarianism have no way Jamaica interpersonal judgments of utility. So the PARETO efficient,

Speaker 2:          44:40          okay.

Speaker 1:          44:41          Transaction is no transaction and the bag lady starves to death.

Speaker 2:          44:47          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          44:53          You'll see when we come to read John Rawls later in the semester, he says, the trouble with utilitarianism is that it doesn't take seriously the differences among persons. The trouble of utilitarianism says John Rawls and his theory of justice is that it doesn't take seriously the differences among persons. You now know enough to see that actually rolls. His argument is half right? Because the truth is, that's the problem with Neal with classical utilitarianism. Classical utilitarianism says, well, if, if, uh, taking all of your utility and gives, giving it to me increases overall neck utility, then we should do that because improve the greatest happiness of the greatest number. We don't care who has the utility, right? So classical utilitarianism is indeed vulnerable two roles as critique. It doesn't take seriously the differences between persons. Right? And we saw that, that when we, you allow interpersonal judgments of utility and interpersonal comparisons, you get the radically redistributive doctrine that Bentham then tries to fend off with his distinction between absolute and practical equality that we talked about last time.

Speaker 1:          46:17          But rolls this point doesn't actually apply. The problem with neoclassical utilitarianism is that it takes the differences between individuals, hypos seriously, so seriously, that you would say the bag lady should starve in this example rather than have something redistributed to her by the state, um, forcibly taken from trial. So classical utilitarianism ignores the differences among individuals. Neoclassical utilitarianism fetishize is the differences among people to an incredible extreme. So that proponents of neoclassical utilitarianism, like Richard Posner and his book, the economics of Justice concedes that it's a problem with you neoclassical utilitarianism, that if you have a disabled person who's not capable of working for anybody else, there's no reason or can, as he puts it contributing to anybody else's, you tell any function. There's no reason that that person shouldn't be allowed to die. And that he posed to say says, well, that's a problem with utilitarianism.

Speaker 1:          47:32          And he throws up his hands and says, I don't really know what to do about it. And, and he moves on. It's a deep problem with neoclassical utilitarianism. But notice from the point of view of the history of ideologies, what has happened in this transition from classical to neoclassical utilitarianism. We've gone from a world in which the doctrine of classical utilitarianism was a very radical idea that will legitimate huge redistribution by the state into a world in which the radical fangs of classical utilitarianism have been ripped out. And it is now a doctrine that is very friendly to whatever status quo happens to be generated in a market system. So it ceases to be this radically redistributive doctrine and in the process imports into utilitarianism, a very robust, some would say hyper robust doctrine of individual rights, and we'll see how that paid out in political theory when we come to look at John Stuart Mill's harm principle next Monday. See you then.
