Speaker 1:          00:01          I want to pick up where I left off on Monday. Speaking about roles is two principles of justice. And as you will recall, I mentioned that roles really changed the subject with respect to what the metric of justice is that rather than focus on utility, somehow measured or welfare as it's sometimes called. Um, instead roles embraces resources. The idea of focusing on certain basic resources, the assumption being that no matter what your particular goals in life turn out to be, no matter what your particular life plan turns out to be. And those are not things we know because we're behind the veil of ignorance. You're going to want more rather than less in the way of liberties, more rather than less in the way of opportunities and more rather than less in the way of income and wealth. So I'm thinking I didn't mention that'll come into play in today's lecture is that rolls has to of course, deal with the fact that the moment you have a theory that affirms more than one value, you have to think about, well what happens when the values conflict?

Speaker 1:          01:25          Um, what if maximizing liberties can only come at the expense of opportunities or if you like, uh, distributing income and wealth and if in a way that you regard as fair or just conflicts with what you say about the distribution of liberties, uh, anytime you have more than one value, you have to deal with the possibility of the conflict among them. And he does deal with that. He has, um, an appeal to what he calls a lexical ran king, which is short for the more cumbersome term lexicographical ranking. And what that means is that anytime you want more rather than fewer in the way of liberties, you want more in fewer in the way of opportunities and you want more than rather than less than the way of income and wealth. But in any time there's a conflict, something higher in the electrical ranking, Trump's what's lower so that if the only way you could get more rather than less income and wealth was to compromise people's liberties, you wouldn't do it.

Speaker 1:          02:32          Okay. So that's the notion of a lexical ranking. You want to maximize each, each item in the lexical ranking subject to the constraint that it does not come at the expense of maximizing something that's higher in that lexical ranking. Okay. And then we talked about his first principle and I gave you the illustration of religious freedom as the of thing he's thinking about when he talks about distributing all liberties in a way that gives people the most extensive possible freedom, compatible with a like freedom for all. And this is not to be confused with the idea of neutrality, right? We went through that. Um, and so we gave the example of whether to have, if you comparing say, a fundamentalist regime with a regime that has a disestablished church. The reason for preferring the regime with the disestablished church is that the most disadvantaged person in that regime is less, namely, that say the fundamentalists is less disadvantaged than the person who does not affirm the established fundamentalist regime beliefs of a fundamentalist regime. So you, you always compare the least, then. I know it's a cumbersome way of putting it, but I, there's not a, there's not a, uh,

Speaker 2:          04:01          mmm

Speaker 1:          04:02          elegant way of putting it. But what you want to do is compare that, the condition of the most adversely affected person in each situation and say which, which would you rather be basically. And you're going to always pack, uh, the one that minimizes the harm to the least advantage person. So the justice, the standpoint of justice is the standpoint of the least advantaged person. But this isn't a bleeding hardpoint but rather a self interested point, um, because you don't know who you are behind the veil of ignorance. Okay. Um,

Speaker 2:          04:46          no,

Speaker 1:          04:48          let's talk about his second principle, which is in fact divided into two principals. So he really has three principles. The, the first part of it is for, he says social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both

Speaker 2:          05:08          attached

Speaker 1:          05:10          two offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity. That is, you'll see to be, that's not a typo. I'll come to, to a, in a minute for some reason known only to John Rawls. Um, he, he put to a before to be, but he meant to put to be before two a in the sense that to be his lexicon prior to two a. Okay. So that's what I'm doing to be first and that to be is what governs the distribution of opportunities. And he's essentially saying,

Speaker 2:          05:46          okay,

Speaker 1:          05:47          fair equality of opportunity.

Speaker 2:          05:49          Okay,

Speaker 1:          05:50          what does that mean? It means no apartheid. It means if you, for instance, we ha we still today have a system in America where occupation by occupation women earn about 86% of what men earn in exactly the same occupation. So there's, there's gender discrimination in renumeration for employment. So we would say, um, those systems are illegitimate systems, which reward women less than men on a systematic basis are, wouldn't be chosen. It's not, you wouldn't never choose a system that privileges one gender because you don't know where they're going to turn out to be the women or the men. You would never accept the system of job reservation such as a park aid because you don't know whether you're going to be black or white and not knowing. Um, you always look from the standpoint of the most adversely affected person. And so you would say, uh, no to, uh, partake.

Speaker 1:          06:54          You'd say no to a system which privileges one gender over the other. Okay. And then you can see, I think how the lexical ranking would come into play because let's suppose you have, um, let's suppose you have a status quo in which as I said, women on average earn 86% of what men earn in the same professions. And somebody comes along and says, well, so we need an affirmative action program to remedy that. Then the question would be, okay, but does the affirmative action program conflict with any thing protected by the first principle? And those opposed to it would say yes. And those in favor of it would say no. And that's what you would be arguing about. Okay. Because it might be the case that if I'm the only way in which you could achieve affirmative action actually interfered with the liberties protected by the first principle, then you would say, even though it's necessary from the standpoint of the second principle, we won't do it.

Speaker 1:          08:05          And if you, if you, uh, if we had more time, we could have gone into the new haven firefighters case and maybe we can do some of this in section that the Supreme Court dealt with loss, um, summer, uh, where essentially they said some version of the fact that the affirmative action program to achieve promotions in the new haven fire department interfered with basic freedoms. Um, that rolls would of put under the first principle and of course the other side made the opposite plane, but that that is essentially how it would be argued about. Um, so I think that the, the principle of fair equality of opportunity is relatively straight forward and its own terms. You would, the, the, uh, animating thought is that not knowing who you're going to be, you would never agree to assist them that systematically this privileges some group for fear that you're going to turn out to be in that group. Okay. Um, so it's relatively straight forward. But now I want to come to, to a, which is probably the argument in roles as book that's attracted the most attention and that is that as it, it's actually third in his lexical ranking. Um, and that is the, the claim that income and wealth is to be distributed to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged individual to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged individual.

Speaker 1:          09:56          This is not a principle that rolls invented. It's an old principle of welfare economics, which used to go under the, under the label Maxi men, not Maxine Milam Maxi men, Max I m I n short for maximize the minimum share Maxi men maximize the minimum share. Um, Rawls calls it the difference principle, but it's the same idea as maximizing the minimum share. And th the, the intuition behind the difference principle is exactly the same intuition that we've been talking about by reference to the, the general conception of distributive justice, um, which is remember distributed all goods equally and less than and equal distribution works to everybody's advantage. And you get from everybody's advantage to focusing on the condition of the worst off. Why? Because of this argument that, well, if you're the worst off person and you can affirm something, then everybody else will affirm it as well. If you'll choose it when you're the most adversely affected, you'll also choose it if you're a second or third or fourth or fifth most adversely affected person. Now, um, there's actually a complexity when you start to think about the distribution of income and wealth that has not come up in the consideration of the other two principals, which I'll just mention and it's then say a couple of things about and then move on and we'll come back to it later. And that is well, but what if, what if there was a principal that gave a very small benefit to the person at the bottom but at a huge cost to the middle class?

Speaker 3:          12:00          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:02          Would you, would you chose it? Because what are the odds that you're going to turn out to be the person at the very bottom?

Speaker 3:          12:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:11          And you would think about this for a variety of reasons. It might be a trickle down argument or you know, Bentham's claim that the ritual burn that crops before giving them to the poor or some other argument. But if you could achieve a very minor increments to the condition, the person at the bottom, at a huge cost to the middle class would, you would, you wouldn't necessarily

Speaker 1:          12:35          want to do that. And so roles has two points to make about that. Um, neither of which is entirely satisfying. The one is his argument about grave risks and it, it works like this. It's the claim that, well, one of the things we know, and this is a perfectly um, uncontroversial claim, one of the things we know is that even when there's moderate scarcity, that doesn't mean there won't be some people who are in grave danger. That is to say there's no necessary relationship between the level of economic development in a country and the distribution of income and well, so you can have a wealthy country, but there still can be extremely poor people in it. Okay. Um, that's true. We can have bag ladies living out of lockers in grand central station, at least when they used to have lockers in grand central station, which they don't anymore. But, uh, let's not deal with that particular piece. So there's no necessary relationship between the level of economic development and the distribution of income and wealth in a society. Therefore, you have to assume, even if, even if

Speaker 1:          14:02          there's relative scarcity, you might turn out to be the person who's starving. You might turn out to be that bag lady. Okay. So even if, and even if the probability of being that person is low, the costs of being that person, that's our high. So, uh, even if the probability, it's like, I don't know if you remember the, the argument, uh, Rumsfeld made, uh, in his counter terrorism strategy and the, the so called 1% solution, uh, the, and this was that even if there's a 1% probability that we're going to be hit by a certain kind of terrorist attack, we should treat it as a 100% probability because the costs of being hated so high.

Speaker 1:          14:54          Um, so the, the, the probability of the event may be low, but the, if you turn out to be that person, you're going to starve to death. So we, it's this as roles as assumption about grave risks. Okay. So all of that's plausible enough. The reason I say it's not entirely satisfying is if you really took the grave risks, ideas seriously, why in the world would you make this third in your lexicon ranking? Because after all, what good is freedom of speech or freedom of religion to somebody who's on the verge of starvation. So I, it's not entirely satisfying in that sense that, that if a justifies saying, well, we will protect the person at the bottom, even though even though the probability of that person turns out to be low because of the grave risks assumption, why then, uh, this is very annoying.

Speaker 2:          15:50          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          15:54          why then would we we make it third, but it's not a really a deep criticism of roles in that you could just say, okay, well we should have reordered his lexical ranking and put this Iraq payment. But anyway, that that's not entirely satisfying. And then the second thing he says that's not entirely satisfying is he says he, he's sort of sensitive to this, this problem that you might get absurdities out of this because

Speaker 2:          16:24          mmm.

Speaker 1:          16:26          If it's, if it's very costly to help the person at the bottom in terms of what other people have to give up, um, maybe, you know, maybe people wouldn't be that impressed by the grave risks assumption. So he throws in this idea of chain connection and he says, well, as a matter of, even though, even though my argument doesn't depend on this, I'm gonna, I'm, I think it's true. It's you. When somebody does that, you know, there's some slight of hand going on and he basically says, well, if you help the person at the bottom that will help, that will have some kind of a chain we action, it will help the person at the next level and that'll help the person, that next level and that'll help the person the next level. So it's a kind of Keynesian idea that if you stimulate demand at the bottom, they'll be multiplier effects throughout the whole system. That'll make everybody else better off too. Well, that may or may not be true. And it also, by the way, I think it makes the disagreement between roles in ism and utilitarianism much less interesting because then anything that rolls would choose a utilitarian would choose as well. And we really want to look at when they pull in opposite directions, if, if we want to see what's at stake between them.

Speaker 1:          17:50          But, so there's this chain connection idea. I think it's just sort of, he throws it in there to make his art, his, his argument, not more, uh, appealing on, on consequentialist grounds, but actually, um, it's not a no reason to believe it's true. And B, if it were, then what's really at stake between roles and utilitarianism becomes much less interesting because by satisfying roles, we're also going to be satisfying utilitarianism. So I think, uh, the best thing about chain connection is to ignore it. So I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna say anything more, but I will say this in, in, um, enrolls his defense on this point, which is a lot of people have criticized roles create. And I even did some of this myself when I think I'm fair in retrospect, people create

Speaker 2:          18:47          mmm.

Speaker 1:          18:50          Examples. We're helping. The person at the bottom comes at a huge cost to others and it looks rather implausible. But one thing we should say about roles is he's not trying to give policy advice for every marginal choice. At one point he says in the book, I'm thinking about the basic structure of society, the basic institutions. So he's not saying, you know, I mean, the example, the example people sometimes gave is the Reagan tax cuts. Um, in the 1980. So actually the, the Bush tax cut, uh, in the, in the two thousands, but the Reagan one had this structure more explicitly where there was a very big tax cut for the wealthy, the tiny tax cut for the people at the very bottom, and a huge increase in middle class taxes, basically, that this was the structure of it. And people said, so roles would prefer this.

Speaker 2:          19:52          MMM.

Speaker 1:          19:54          And you know, the answer is he, he's not trying to make a recommendation at the neck, at the level of the next incremental policy choice. He's trying to say what the underlying institutions should be structured as. And so he, he would resist saying, well, this shows my theory. It's silly, or my theory doesn't generate our, uh, conclusions that I want it to a, he, it's not a, it's not, he's not a policy wonk. Okay? He's saying this is, he's thinking about constitutional principles, basic principles, the basic structure of society. Um, and indeed, I'll just make one footnote to that footnote, which is,

Speaker 2:          20:37          mmm.

Speaker 1:          20:39          If you, if you start at the front of a theory of justice and you really plow through all of it, uh, you get to about page 300 and something, and he says words to the effect that, um, his theory is agnostic between capitalism and socialism.

Speaker 3:          20:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          20:58          And he, he took a lot of abuse for that in, in the 1970s and 1980s people's, you know, I say, wow, you may not plow through 300 pages of a book about justice. I don't need to be told it's agnostic between capitalism and socialism. Gimme a break. Uh, but in defense of rolls on that point, he would say, look,

Speaker 3:          21:20          okay,

Speaker 1:          21:21          what economic system actually operates in the interest of the least advantaged? That's an empirical question of political economy, trial and error and so on. That is not a question for political philosophy to settle. I don't know whether it's capitalism, socialism, some version of a mixed economy, um, that works to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged person that's for the policymakers in political economist to figure out what I'm telling you is what the standards should be. And so I think that that is a, and that is a good argument on roles as part of this. And he's saying this is what the standard should be. The standard should be that whatever system you have works to the greatest benefit of, of the least advantage play at when compared with other systems. And yes, you know,

Speaker 3:          22:17          yeah.

Speaker 1:          22:18          Before the experience of centrally planned economies, people may have thought, uh, some version of state socialism would do that after half a century of experience with it doesn't look so good. So we'll go back to some kind of market system, uh, and after, you know, decades of experience with unregulated markets or minimally regulated markets, and we discovered the costs of those for the people at the bottom, maybe we'll end up with something else. So it's not a failing of my John Rolls, his theory that I don't tell you what kind of, uh, economic system to have. My aspiration is to tell you what the normative criterion is that it should meet. Okay. So that's the, that I think that's the, the most important takeaway point. Now let's give you a picture for those who like pictures. And for those who don't, we will, we will explain it in words. This is, this has gone back to our paredo style of diagram. Let's suppose that the status quo, okay. And now we've got primary goods in this case and Commonwealth for two people, a IPN be along here. And that's the, that is the district. That is the status quo. So Aa has more than B.

Speaker 3:          23:53          Okay.

Speaker 1:          23:55          Roles is difference principle or the so called maximin principle of welfare economics says rob up line down to that. That's point is perfect quality. Right? And then go east and everything in this shaded area.

Speaker 3:          24:21          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          24:23          Is What we might call roll superior to the status quo. So is it kind of l shaped indifference curve, right. Because down through the status quo to equality and then it turns right. Anyone want to take a stab at telling us why? Why would you have these l shaped him? Difference curves. Yeah. Why didn't you get the mine? Uh, cool. Come to them.

Speaker 3:          25:05          Okay.

Speaker 4:          25:08          You can move right as far as possible. And that will be increasing the goods for B and then as you move down you have to stop at the quantity.

Speaker 1:          25:20          Okay. But why I'm, why say a has this, my tried when we start out, why would it, why, why isn't this points here that I'm lighting up say roles preferred

Speaker 4:          25:30          because then a becomes the least advantaged person and they have less than

Speaker 1:          25:36          exactly right. You got it. So the reason we turn, we'd go head east or turn right at the point of equality is what are we trying to do in Matt? We maximizing the minimum share with saying the person will only want to say is that whoever turns out to be at the bottom has the highest possible share. So if we went from x to down here, then then we would have changed who at the bottom. And that's not important. What would be important is that the, this bottom share would be smaller and we wouldn't want that. So we don't care who gets it because we don't know whether we're a or B. That's not material, right? We had done our way, the one that when the veil of ignorance turns out to be lifted, we don't know where that we're going to be a or B. So we just gonna assume we're going to be whoever turns out to be the worst off. Okay, so this is, this distance here represents the minimum and you wouldn't want it to get smaller basically. Okay. So if we moved anywhere in this area here, the minimum share would get bigger. So if we went to y, right, then we could do a new l shaped indifference curve. Why is it doing this much later? Why isn't there a restart much later button?

Speaker 1:          27:06          Okay, so, so that's the basic idea. You, you just get the, keep getting these al shape indifference curves. Okay. Now I want to say something about what a radical idea this is in a philosophical sense.

Speaker 1:          27:25          It's not necessarily that radically in the distributed of sense for the reason I've already indicated to you. It could be compatible with, um, trickled down if we took the view that trickle down works better than any other system from the point of view of the least demand cottage. So we might say, if you think about, let's put the, the, this role's Bentham and Paredo compared, this is a lobe taking something of a liberty because we've got different things on the axes. So it's sort of a little, ultimately not coherent, but I think you can still get an insight out of it if we, if we, uh, start with that status quo. We know watch Paredo preferred, right? So everything that's Pereda preferred is also rolls preferred, right? So if it turned out to be true, that the best way to help the person at the bottom is to have, um, only the market trend, you know, uh, market transactions, then we would do it.

Speaker 1:          28:37          Um, but if it turned out that there was other ways that we're parade out undecidable like these, um, to help the person that bottom, we would do that. Okay. So it's not necessarily radical in a distributive sense. You could get very egalitarian, radical redistribution, but you could also get, uh, a diff, you, you could get no redistribution and could get the parade, oh, system. If that turned out to be the way in which the most disadvantaged person is help the most. Um, but it's radical in a philosophical sense that I think is captured by the fact that it, by the observation that we don't care whether it, whether we turn out to be gay or whether we turn out to B, two, B, B, two, B, B. Um, and that is the following.

Speaker 3:          29:40          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:46          There's been a huge debate in our lifetimes over whether the differences between us are the result of nature or nurture right now. Enormous debate. You read, you know, you read a book like calm Charles Murray losing ground. How many people I've heard of that club?

Speaker 2:          30:08          Nobody. Wow. Uh,

Speaker 1:          30:13          quickly, things change. Well, it was a, it was a book that came out about probably 20 years ago. That's probably why you haven't read it. Uh, basically saying that the differences are between us are genetically determined that genetic differences in Iq, uh, that show up in, uh, various ways includes including racially. And it was a huge storm of criticism. He was accused of being a racist, uh, and there was charges and counter charges. Um, and people said, no, it's not genetics, it's environment and so on. So one of the most important things, and I'm going to focus on this much more next Monday, I just want to mention it now so you can think about it. One of the, one of the points roles makes his look possibly differences between us, our genetic,

Speaker 3:          31:09          okay.

Speaker 1:          31:09          If the differences between us such genetic, it just moral luck, right? Because you didn't choose to have the genes that you have and not only didn't you choose it, you didn't do anything to get the jeans.

Speaker 2:          31:25          God, it's moral luck.

Speaker 1:          31:28          On the other hand, suppose differences between us, our environmental,

Speaker 2:          31:34          well,

Speaker 1:          31:37          it's moral luck. You didn't choose to be born in the country and the family you were born into. You didn't make any choices in that regard. Furthermore, you didn't do any work to be

Speaker 2:          31:50          in the

Speaker 1:          31:51          family or the country, country or the family you happened to have been raised in. Again, it's just luck from your point of view. It's a completely random thing. You could have been born somewhere else to somebody else. So you could have been born to parents who didn't have the resources that your parents have. So this whole debate about nature and nurture says John Rawls is beside the point from the standpoint of justice. We don't care. And that is his argument. I think for what it's worth, the most important argument enrolls a spot that the differences between us are morally arbitrary, whether it's nature or nurture, it doesn't matter. They're not the result of choice and they're not really result of work. They had just fell out of the sky as far as were actually concerned. That being the case, I'm going to, I'm going to go into the assumptions behind that in more detail on Monday, but from the point of view of this discussion, so we don't really care if a or B is the worst off person. We're just going to say from the standpoint of justice, we want to improve the lot of the worst off person. And even if the worst off person changes, you know, so we go from x, you know, two, two g,

Speaker 3:          33:27          okay.

Speaker 1:          33:28          It's morally irrelevant. All we want to do is maximize the share of the person at the bottom. So that's the roles in difference principle.

Speaker 3:          33:50          And

Speaker 1:          33:59          as I said, you can see it, it overlaps and contained with and contains the predo principle. And this has some overlap with Bentham, uh, in that it would sanction moving into the parade. Oh, undecidable zone here. That might would be Bentham preferred if it works for the greatest benefit of the least advantaged person and rolls his claim to you. The reader is, this is the principle you would choose. You would want the economic system that works to the benefit of the person at the bottom.

Speaker 3:          34:40          What do you think?

Speaker 1:          34:50          Who likes this idea? Who doesn't like it? What's, what don't you like about who was it was, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          35:11          Uh, it, it assumes that, uh, once you're born, you're going to stay in that position for the rest of your life. There's nothing you can do about it.

Speaker 1:          35:20          Ah, okay. That, well, that's a good observation. I'm not entirely sure what you saying. Just just explain a little bit more and I'll see if he was saying what I think, what about effort that people put into changing their social position. Okay. What about effort? I thought you were making another, so let me just respond to the point I thought you were making, which you weren't making, but we should nonetheless address, uh, since people do sometimes make it, but then I'll come to your point, which is in any way much more interesting. The, the point I thought you were making is this has no dynamic side to it. That is to say, um, it's, it's, it's static and exactly the way the predo principle is static. But in any economist would want a theory that has a dynamic dimension to what you would want to know over time. What's the effect of a certain redistributive change. Uh, and that, so we would, we would want to say, you know,

Speaker 3:          36:16          mmm,

Speaker 1:          36:18          we would want to say, well, if benefiting the person at the bottom slightly improves, improves their welfare, uh, in the next three months. But it comes at the cost of lower economic growth over time. Would we want, would we want to do that? Okay. And it's fair to say roles doesn't have an answer to that question. He doesn't have a dynamic theory. On the other hand, I think his defense, this is why it's ultimately not a very interesting criticism. I think his defense would kick in that while I'm telling you what the criteria and should be, not how to run the economy. But let's come to the point about fn and this has got to to some degree Greek get us into a next Monday's lecture. But it's good to make it a start at it cause it's a very deep point actually. What about effort? So yes, the capacities we have might be distributed in morally arbitrary ways,

Speaker 3:          37:32          but

Speaker 1:          37:34          some people choose to work really hard and some people choose to sit on the couch and watch ESPN all day.

Speaker 3:          37:42          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          37:43          Right. And let's suppose you have two people with exactly the same Iq, but one watches ESPN all day and one studies hard. So the one who studies hard gets the a and the one who watches ESPN all day gets to see and

Speaker 3:          38:09          okay.

Speaker 1:          38:12          I take the input of what you saying. Well there's some legitimate dessert there. The person who works should get the AA. Yeah. Okay. Now roles sort of with you, but in a way that I don't think works for him because if you read Rawls carefully, what he says is exactly what you'd said. He says this, yes, the differences between us, I'm morally arbitrary,

Speaker 3:          38:40          but

Speaker 1:          38:42          the use we choose to make of our capacities is not,

Speaker 3:          38:49          why doesn't it work for him?

Speaker 1:          38:52          This was sorta like bent them being scared of the egalitarian implications of his theory. And so he wheels out the difference between absolute and practical equality of it hasn't really worked for him either. What reasons? He said, why doesn't this really worked for roles?

Speaker 3:          39:08          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          39:14          me, sorry, could you say that it's someone's like naturally, you know, just by luck given a capacity or a predilection to work hard. So that's exactly that. The where I, I was hoping you would go that well. Some people have a supercharged work ethic and some people don't. And why do some people have a supercharged work ethic because of the way they were raised? Perhaps. Maybe some of it's genetic paps, but why isn't that morally arbitrary as well? If the differences in Iq are morally arbitrary? So weakness of the well weakness of the, well no morally arbitrary too or strengthened the, well, it's morally arbitrary. So you know, the, the person who sits on the couch watching ESPN all day just doesn't have the same, he doesn't have the moral luck to have a lot of Protestant work ethic. So he should, shouldn't be penalized for that. So now you can see why roles doesn't want to go there. Right? Because it has the effect of completely obliterating the concept of any personal responsibility.

Speaker 3:          40:48          Okay.

Speaker 1:          40:49          Right. Ultimately, because once you make that move, why should you differentiate between the, the weakness of the well or the strength of the well and say that's not morally arbitrary, but differences in Iq are more morally arbitrary or athletic ability. RMR morally arbitrary. It doesn't seem to work. Right. So it's, it's not as satisfying way out for roles. And he does it because he's afraid of the radical implications of this view. But what's, what's interesting about this, you know, Rawls is fixed, doesn't work, but he's underlying arguments are very powerful argument. I mean, isn't it right? It, isn't it just true that you know, the differences between us nature or nurture are morally arbitrary. They all, it is moral luck whether it's genetics, so upbringing, nothing. You did nothing. You chose nothing. You have therefore any particular right to. So you know, you guys think you all worked so hard to get into Yale and all this and you deserve to be here. It's allowed of bug not have. You deserve to be here more than anybody else. That's what he's saying. You know, it might be a nice fiction you're telling yourself, but you know, and his uh, you know, as this little exchange showed his attempt to put some limits on his ideas, just pathetic. It doesn't work. But the basic, the basic argument about moral arbitrariness, it's totally compelling. Anyone here think it's, it's not compelling and I don't think it's a good argument. I don't think it's compelling because it has implications. I don't want to live with.

Speaker 3:          42:58          MMM.

Speaker 1:          43:02          B You have to have some other reason. I mean, it may, well, I think it does. Let me say this. I think it has implications that if you really drill down into them, probably nobody in this room wants to live with just like John Rawls didn't want to live with them, but what's a good way out?

Speaker 3:          43:26          Okay.

Speaker 1:          43:30          Who thinks I'm wrong? Who thinks this is a bad argument? It just not a good argument.

Speaker 3:          43:39          Nobody. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          43:54          Yeah. Well not that I disagree, but it seems to strip down human freewill in that, um, if the only condition which manages the circumstances of your birth, then you don't really have any choice as to the course of your life. Um, so it seems, it seems completely deterministic, which might not.

Speaker 1:          44:15          Yes and no. It's not it. I think it's agnostic on the question of freewill. He's not saying we don't have free, well, maybe we do. Maybe we done. I think what he's saying is if some of us have a greater say to work hard or to, you know, engage in delayed gratification than others, that is a difference between us. You know, just as an empirical matter. That is a difference between us.

Speaker 3:          44:46          MMM.

Speaker 1:          44:48          But the person who has what he's saying is that the person who has the greater capacity for deferred gratification or the greater capacity to work hard isn't entitled to more benefits than the person who doesn't happen just in virtue of that strong strength of the will. So He's, he's not saying, I mean, it might also be true that we don't have free will, that's another matter. But I think he's just not taking a position on that question. So, um, in that, you know, I, I think in that sense, I mean, he, he, he, he, you could, you could do a two by two in Philly and all the boxes. He's, he's not, he's not saying we don't have, well, we, we, we can't make choices. He's just saying the choices that we make don't give us any, any particular rights. Now, I mean, I, I think one is, and maybe what you're getting at that is, does pin the tail on the donkey. Is he what he, what he's saying is, um, ultimately subversive of the idea of individual responsibility. But that's not the same thing as determinism. You know, when, when did they come together and other settings. So if somebody says, uh, while I committed the murder, but I was in the grip of, of uh, schizophrenia disorder and so I didn't have free, well, so I'm not responsible because I did, you know, that's when,

Speaker 3:          46:25          uh,

Speaker 1:          46:27          determinism and the issue of the welcome together, but he's not making that kind of argument. He's conceding I think for the purposes of discussion that the risk free. Well, but just saying, I'm s I'm saying when you take away his fix, which really I don't think it does work. You're saying that differences that flow from our strengths of well should an entitle us to anything in particular. So none of you deserve all the good things you've gotten in life just because you work hard. So why, if you work hard, you have the capacity to work hard. I let people did it.

Speaker 3:          47:08          So

Speaker 1:          47:13          anyone think it's just not a good argument? Anyone think? Seems like a good argument, but you really don't like it. At least some who really likes it. The people I want to go and watch ESPN all day.

Speaker 2:          47:37          MMM.

Speaker 1:          47:39          You know, and they're, they're philosophers who followed the same tuition. There's a guy called Phillip Perez, a Belgian political thinker. Yeah. What were you going to say?

Speaker 3:          47:54          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          47:56          Um, is this, uh, is this an argument in favor of complete equality then in terms of redistribution? Okay, so that's a good question. I'll leave Philly out of it. Cause your question's more important, not when he has to say, um, is this, uh, an argument for equality roles? His answer is a qualified yes. He's saying it's not an argument for equality. It's an argument for the difference principle. He's saying it's an argument for distributing things in such a way that they benefit the part, the person,

Speaker 2:          48:32          the bottom. Now

Speaker 1:          48:37          you have to have a whole theory of how the political economy works to say whether redistribution toward, to absolute equality would do that. Because if, if redistribution to equality would destroy incentives, let's say. And so that over time, you know, this would go this way, um, then it wouldn't be right. Um, but he's so, so it's, it's an, he would say we, what it's an argument for is, is detaching what we get from any theory that it's ours as, as some kind of moral, right? And connecting it to what some theory that the, the best going theory of the day about how you organize an economy to benefit the person at the bottom. That's what you should do. If [inaudible] quality does that, you have a qual. If the market does that, you have the market, but it's not anything else. It's just as pure consequentialist plane do it in order to help the person at the bottom. So Fun paresis point, Phillipe, fond paresis boy, he says, while he wrote a book called Real Freedom for all, and he said, yes, everybody should get a minimum basic income and it shouldn't have anything to do with their work, their capacity to work. So, and the famous one liner, he says, even surface should get pet. Even surfers should get paid. We should, uh, h s s e s fond parades puts it. There should be the highest sustainable universal basic income, whatever that is.

Speaker 1:          50:24          And it shouldn't be connected to work because you know, capacity to work is morally arbitrary. So what I'm going to talk about on Mondays, I'm going to come, we're going to really dig into this question because you can now see, I mean, one of the ironies I want you to mull over between now and then, one of the ironies is that this puts rolls white to the left of marks in a certain sense because as we saw marks was as straight up, uh, enlightenment theorist wedded to the whole workmanship idea. Remember, lock workmanship, labor theory of value, all that stuff, right? The Marxist critique of capitalism was the work. I doesn't get what he produces. Rawls is saying, we don't care in any moral sense. We don't care who did the work because the capacity for work isn't, uh, uh, capacity that brings with it any particular moral valence because of this moral arbitrariness argument. Okay? We will pick up from there next week.
