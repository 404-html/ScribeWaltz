Speaker 1:          00:02          So welcome back everybody. It's probably, uh, will take a while to wrestle your brains back to what we were talking about before the break. Um, and I'll, I'll, I'll do my best to help in that endeavor. And um, we're talking, we're really finishing up the first two thirds of the course. Well by talking about John Rawls. Um, a very interesting figure and phenomenon in modern political philosophy. We finish it up the first two thirds of the course in the sense that, um, this is the third enlightenment tradition. We're talking about the first two having been utilitarianism and Marxism and after we finished with the roles, we're going to talk about the Anti Enlightenment tradition and then the democratic traditions. Um, so roles is an odd figure in some ways. Um, if, if I had been here or if my predecessor from a prior generation had been here, I teach teaching a course like this in the 1950s or early 1960s.

Speaker 1:          01:27          And somebody had speculated that maybe are very major figure would emerge in American political philosophy. There would've been a lot of skepticism and they would have been even more skepticism if somebody had said and they would have been a theorist of the social contract. And I think that would have been two reasons for that skepticism. One is that political philosophy was really not thought to be a particularly important area of philosophy of academic philosophy in the 1950s and 1960s, the people who, who were sort of seen as the cutting edge in philosophy were doing philosophy of language, logic, epistemology, metaphysics and political philosophy was sort of weighed down on the totem pole. Uh, it was a subdivision of ethics and sort of ethics for many people if you like. Um, and the notion that anybody in philosophy who did political philosophy would turn out to be a major figure would have attracted a lot of skepticism among academic philosophers. And yet John Roles, I think today, and if you, if you polled, if you went around the most prestigious philosophy departments in the world, not just in the English speaking world today and said, who was the most important philosopher of the last third of the 20th century? Not Political Philosophy, just philosopher.

Speaker 2:          03:12          MMM.

Speaker 1:          03:13          And you and you asked that question of

Speaker 2:          03:18          okay,

Speaker 1:          03:18          people in major philosophy departments around the world roles would be cited more than any other person.

Speaker 2:          03:25          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:26          That, any doubt about it. I don't have any doubt about it. He'd decided more than any other person.

Speaker 2:          03:32          MMM.

Speaker 1:          03:35          So that's one reason people would have been skeptical that they just didn't think political philosophy is that important and, and this sort of serious heavyweights in phosphene did other things. But then I think the second reason people would have been skeptical is that a theorist of the social contract and everybody knew that the social contract, which is you all know has been around in its modern form, at least since the 17th century. Everybody knew it had these two huge problems. One was that it didn't have, um,

Speaker 2:          04:09          okay,

Speaker 1:          04:09          any grounding in natural law that people accepted. And the second was it never was a social contract. We now know from 150 years of anthropology than ever was a social contract. Aristotle was closer to being accurate when he sort of treated human beings as inherently political. There was never a pre political condition.

Speaker 2:          04:32          MMM.

Speaker 1:          04:34          And as you now know, because we've studied Robert Nozick MMM.

Speaker 1:          04:39          The revival of the social contract tradition answered both those questions first by replacing natural law with some version of a manual cons, ethics. So ethic, uh, con becomes the place holder for natural law. And on the other hand, working with hypothetical contracts rather than actual contracts. The asking the question, what would people agree to? Not what did people agreed to, uh, under certain specified conditions. But neither of those ideas was central to Nozick. I was invented by Nozick rare that both of those ideas were invented by roles and Nozick was one of many people who reacted to roles. I had pedagogical reasons for dealing with Nozick first, namely that his argument, it goes, grows so directly out of locks. But if this was a course in the history of 20th century political philosophy, of course we would have done roles first. And it's really important to say this because no one knows x book would never have been written.

Speaker 1:          05:47          But for roles. And I think that one measure of the importance of roles is that there are probably 50 bucks and I don't know how many articles that would never have been written, but for roles you can go out and find roles as book in the library, uh, and you'll find it on the shelf next to the book. Just books listing the citations to roles as buck. And so that's a very interesting fact. It's also an interesting fact because roles is not a great in the sense that we think of as Hobbes, Locke or male ow, ow, Dewey who we don't read in this course as great in the sense that he does. Most of those people had a view of the world that range right across all domains of knowledge. So if you read, you know, locked, he had a philosophy and a view of, of knowledge of you have language of your theology, of your politics, uh, a view of everything.

Speaker 1:          06:54          Mel had a theory of science. He had a mathematical theory. He had, um, theories of meaning. He had, um, uh, an epistemology and he had a theory of politics. Dewey, same story. There's a, there's a whole, there's a whole world view that's worked out in every what we today think of as disciplines, but for most of the tradition, we're not divided up in the way we divide things up today, but they have the people we tend to call greats had a view that ranges across the whole range, the whole, um, gamut of knowledge, uh, roles that didn't do that. He doesn't have a metaphysics, he doesn't have a pest homology, doesn't have a theory of science. He doesn't have a theory of language. He only wrote this book. Uh, basically you wrote some articles which led up to the book and then some, some things that follow out of the book, but basically his book, the theory of Justice is it, um, and so he's, he's not a great in that sense of the greats of the tradition, but he certainly has more intellectual staying power than anyone.

Speaker 1:          08:08          Any con contemporary in a broad sense of the word that you've read in this course or we'll read in this course. People will still be reading roles long after, um, uh, people like me have been forgotten about. So, um, in that sense it's a really important figure and uh, he's a really important figure, um, also in the sense that even if you don't like his arguments, even if you've completely unpersuaded by all of his arguments, you have to come to grips with them. Uh, I don't, I'm not in sympathy with any of his major arguments. Um, but he's, he's not, you cannot work in this field and not deal with John Rolls. That's how important he is and he's going to be for a long time. So that's just by way of background, um, and letting you know what you're dealing with. One other thing I'd say about a theory of justice is it is not a well written book. It's not badly written in the sense that it's unclear. Any given paragraph is clear enough. If you sit down and figure out what the jargon means, it's not a hard and that in the sense that,

Speaker 2:          09:25          um, uh,

Speaker 1:          09:29          say the technical sides of, of, of marks or parade or hard, but it's not captivating writing. You need a chair with a hard back to read this book and there's a reason for that. The reason is that although the book was published in 1971,

Speaker 2:          09:47          mmm,

Speaker 1:          09:48          roles actually came up with the main ideas in the 1960s in a couple of articles and most famous of which was called justices fairness. And he circulated these articles in the profession, in the philosophy profession and he kept getting criticisms and he eventually had a book manuscript and he circulated the book manuscript and he kept getting criticisms and every time somebody sent him a criticism, he added three paragraphs to address the criticism. This is not the way to write a book if you want it to be captivating. So it's got this kind of almost plodding quality that's a sort of at variance with the, the hype I just gave you about his importance, but it's to do with the composition of the book. Uh, I mean the actual, oh, there's 10 years of endlessly fiddling with this manuscript. Uh, and I should should also say that he, he eventually did a second edition of the book later in his life.

Speaker 2:          10:50          MMM.

Speaker 1:          10:52          Which is a substantial rewrite of it from the first edition. So he, he was somebody who couldn't, who couldn't stop fiddly. Um, and it's not a, it's not a trait to which I would, I would commend to you, but in any event, there it is. So, and it's, it's any long and if not plotting, certainly ponderous a buck. And My, my goal in the, in these lectures about roles is to try and pull out the main ideas for you. And in particularly the main enduring ideas, because Raul's, like everybody else, we've read as an architect, tonic theorist fails. The, the pieces don't add up there. Big logical holes in the big structure. Um, so if you want it to be the silver bullet or the final word, it's not going to happen. Nonetheless, there are very important in during insights, uh, questions, roles put on the table, which have not gone away. And I'm not going to go away for anybody who wants to think about the fundamentals of political association. So, um,

Speaker 3:          12:02          okay,

Speaker 1:          12:02          what are these ideas? Well, they, they get, I think Mick stop to some extent or hidden or obscured or it's made to seem more complicated than they should be, partly because of the architecture of his theory, partly because of the way he does the exposition. He has the story about the original position, which is his version of the social con, the hypothetical social contract. And, and let me just give you the intuition, but I want to preface it by saying it's actually not important to his theory. It's really an expository device because what he does is he structures a hypothetical choice and then he gives you a certain kinds of information to get you to choose a certain outcome. So unless the outcome is itself independently desirable, um, the fact that this, this thought experiment leads to it is of no interest. Let me give you an example before we get into roles, which is one that he himself Gibbs, and this is the, I'm not sure if it seemed one of the excerpts you read or not, but this is a, an observation that has been around long before royal. She says, what is the fair way to cut a cake? Is this, you read anybody? What's a fair way to cut a cake?

Speaker 3:          13:29          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          13:31          probably not if nobody, I'm sure you spent your spring break wading through roles. Yeah, correct. So you give the, the person with a knife gets the last slice and what will they do?

Speaker 3:          13:53          Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:53          So if you say, well, how would they divide it? Yeah. If you think so. So what are the, are two assumptions there? Okay. You say, what's the fair way to cut a cake? The answer, the fair way to cut a cake is to give the, the, the person with the knife gets the last slice. What will they do? They will divide it equally. Right? That's how the person or the last, the knife gets a biggest possible slice. Right? Right. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          14:26          Okay.

Speaker 1:          14:27          Anyone think that's not the fair way to cut a cake? Do it anyway. Okay. Well there are two assumptions there that are worth bringing to the fore. Just just for, um, pup. Is that what I'm going to say to you about roles in a minute? One is that we think dividing the cake equally is the right

Speaker 1:          14:52          is, you know, we, we're, we've devised a system where the case can you get equally divided, right? But do it, do we think it should be equally divided? What if we, it, what if I added other information? Like, uh, one of the people in the room was starving and hadn't eaten for three days or one was a diabetic or, right. And we could add other information which would make you one to do you want to get an equal division? Right? So the cake cutting example doesn't show you that equality is a good thing. It presumes that you've already decided equality is a good thing and you want to get the person to choose equality. Right.

Speaker 3:          15:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:39          Then the other thing that it, it is, it assumes is that people are gonna behave self interestedly, right? When we, when we give the person the knife and say divided however you like, you get the last slice, we're assuming that she or he will behave, be wanting to get the biggest possible slice. So we've uh, immediately we've got two assumptions built into their one that equality is a good thing. That's the result we actually do want to get. And secondly that people are going to behave in a self interested way, right? Which isn't to say they're bad assumptions, but it's to note that they are assumptions. Okay. Now rolls as original position has the same structures, the cake cutting fee for both of those reasons. He has a distributed outcome that he wants to convince you is, is a good thing and he's going to create a, a hypothetical choice situation that will lead you to it, right? But that doesn't itself establish that it is a good thing. You have to have some other argument to convince you that it is a good thing. And I'll tell you what that argument is, but it's completely independent of this expository expository device that's modeled on the cake cutting. So the expository device that's model on the cake cutting goes like this. It says, imagine,

Speaker 1:          17:13          imagine you had to design a social order, a society and it co which include in a broader sense of the word, it will include an economic system, a political system and so on.

Speaker 3:          17:27          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:28          And you didn't know whether you were going to turn out to be ritual poor male or female, what you are going to be, whether you're going to be an athlete or a nerd. Um, you didn't have any particular information about yourself. Do you watch your, where are you going to have an Iq or low Iq musical? Not Musical. I had good athlete, a bad athlete, nothing. You didn't have that kind of information about yourself.

Speaker 3:          18:02          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          18:02          Which doesn't mean that there, there could be people who didn't have those characteristics, right? It's just like say you have to design the rules of chess and you didn't know whether or not you're going to be good at using bishop better using our bishop. Then, but then using a night, but yet to agree on certain rules. Okay. So the rules for designing society, you're going to choose while being ignorant of what he calls particular facts about your circumstances. You're gonna know only certain pretty general things. Like he says, it's a world of moderate scarcity. So it, it's not super abundance, which is a good thing cause we found out when we studied Marx that there's no coherent idea of super abundant, moderate scas. The, it's not very, it's not a developing country. What we think of today. Is it the third world or developing country? It's basically principals for countries of the sort we live in.

Speaker 1:          19:06          Okay. So, um, moderate scarcity and we're gonna assume certain basic when he calls laws of psychology and economics. And I think that people largely behave self interestedly is the most important of those. Um, but beyond that, you're not going to have particular knowledge about yourself and your circumstances in particular, sorry to use particular into conflicting ways. But in Perth in particular, you're not going to have the kind of knowledge that would allow you to buy us things in your own direction so that if you knew you were going to turn out to be female, you could, you know, say women should earn twice as much as men, but you're not going to know whether you're going to turn out to be female or male. So the kind of knowledge you're going to be denied is the kind of knowledge that would let you buy us things in your own favor. Okay. So that's the sense in which he's trying to be a contrarian. He calls his principles procedural expressions of the categorical imperative. There's a mouthful for you on the first day back from spring break. We know what the categorical imperative is, right? It's, it's, um,

Speaker 1:          20:32          it's the imperative to choose things that are universalize about things that you would, well, regardless of the consequences. So thanks. You would, well, from every conceivable standpoint and what roles is trying to do, I says these a procedural expression of it. What he's trying to do is say, well, if you don't have knowledge of where, which kind of person you're going to turn out to be in terms of rich or poor male or female or black or white or Hispanic or some other ethnic group or a religious of some sort, or as atheist, you don't know any of those things. You're going to have to think about what are the social, what are the best social rules for people regardless of who they turn out to be. And that's the sense in which he wants to think of himself as a content. So where's for nosy could sort of just a slogan for Rawls. It's really built into the structure of his argument.

Speaker 3:          21:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:37          And the idea of the original position is to force us even while recognizing where self interested to force us to think about society as a whole, to think about what, what, what would be desirable regardless of who you turned out to be.

Speaker 3:          21:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:58          And so then his eye, the basic way, the book, if you had time to read the whole book, the Basic Way the book proceeds is he starts out with this complete veil of ignorance and tries to get to get you to agree with him and this sense, it's not even really a social contract. He's, he's not saying, you know, would you agree with one another? What he wants to say is, will you the reader agree with me, John Rawls, that any rational church and would choose the principles that I'm arguing for. In that sense, he's actually,

Speaker 3:          22:39          yeah,

Speaker 1:          22:39          we can't do it in this course because we did an read Hobbs. He's actually more like Hobbes. Then he is like lock because you know, for hubs the social contract isn't a legitimate because anybody made it, but because it must be rational to make it, any rational person says Hobbs would agree to give up their freedom to an absolute sovereign because anything else needs to civil war in is just madness. So it's, it's an, it's a property of rationality for Hobbs that people were, we'll accept the authority of the sovereign. There isn't really a contract. Well, Rawls is more like hubs on that point. He's, he's saying, I want to pee. I John Rawls want to persuade you, the reader that any rational person would choose my principles of justice over the going alternatives because his style of thinking,

Speaker 3:          23:39          okay,

Speaker 1:          23:40          people go on and on about roles being abstract and an ideal theorist and head in the clouds. But actually his actual way of proceeding is, isn't that it's very, it's comparative. Basically what he does is he says, well, what are the going alternatives? There's utilitarianism. There's, there are other ones you haven't read in the score. So it's this perfectionism, which is what he thinks of in Aristotle. There's Marxism. Um, I want to show you that my principal does better than the going alternatives from the perspective of being behind this veil of ignorance. If somebody else comes along with another principal and shows that it does even better than mine, then I would give it up. So his basic mode of reasoning is comparative.

Speaker 3:          24:28          Okay. And

Speaker 1:          24:34          what, so what he does is he as a general principle of justice, which he wants to persuade you off first from behind this veil of ignorance and then more specific applications of it. Um, he ends up coming up with two principles of justice that are the applications, which are really three principles. So I'll go through them with you, but then more if you win more and more into the book he gets, he keeps adding information and lets you design more specific institutions and so on. Always with the caveat that as you get more information later, you can't go back and undo choices that you made earlier. Right. So it's sort of like, I don't know if you've been around long enough to ever see Congress go through a base closing exercise for the military, um, where they, they realize that there's going to be special pleading from every can, you know, say say they're going to get rid of 30 military basis. Um, every congressional district that has a base in it is going to have good reasons why yes, we should get rid of 30 basis, but not the one in our district. Right. We Know wanna stop making submarines in Groton,

Speaker 1:          25:58          right? Whatever it is. And so what they do is they get an, they, they get, they create a commission, um, that agrees on the base closing nationwide and they have to vote up or down on the entire package and then they can start undoing it later so that the just has a kind of structure of a base closing commission that as the veil of ignorance starts to be lifted, you know, and then you discover, well, actually I turned out to be female rather than male. I can't then say, oh, well women should get some certain particular kind of advantage. Right. So that, that's the way the book proceeds. Now. Um, I think

Speaker 1:          26:46          one other reason I should tell you about, oh, actually two reasons I should tell you about concerning why this book had such a big impact, why this book has had the staying power that it's had. One is, it's really very much a book of the 1960s and seventies where there was just some extent, a crisis of confidence about liberal democratic institutions born of the student's movement and this, the Vietnam War and everything that went with it. That is to say, uh, there was a generation of people who thought we needed to have critical standards for evaluating government and utilitarianism, which was the main alternative around, didn't seem to provide them. And roles came up with this notion that we could come up with an independent standard for judging

Speaker 1:          27:46          actually existing political systems and then use it to see how they measure up. I wouldn't have to be rooted in natural law and all the problems that went with it and was going to be rooted in this universal content ideal. And it would give us a principles by which we could evaluate not only what our government does, but other governments. So I think it was just some extent kind of thirst for criteria that that was characteristic of that era that, um, gave rolls his staying power. But then I think the other reason, the other reason that Rawls has had staying power was that he change the subject that people who had been squabbling about utilitarianism for 150 years had been arguing about because, and again, this is, you know, this now because of the first half of this semester, but utilitarianism had basically been

Speaker 3:          28:57          mmm.

Speaker 1:          29:00          Struggling between two variants. One which we think often the terminology of this course as classical utilitarianism we might call objectivist, where you make strong interpersonal judgments of utility. And the problem with that as we saw is, and as Raul says repeatedly in his book, it doesn't take seriously the differences among persons. You could see this in the utility monster example. You could see this in the, um, the problems that we have with the bag lady and Donald Trump. You can see this in problems with the disabled that, that if you don't allow interpersonal, I, I'm sorry, if you do allow interpersonal judgments of utility, you can do draconian things in the name of maximizing utility. But if you, if you say, no, we're not going to do that, and you make the neoclassical move and use then say we cannot even allow that. Taking a nickel from Trump and giving it to the bag lady necessarily leads to an increase in social utility, then you seem to have the opposite problem.

Speaker 1:          30:10          So the, the objectivist problem is it allows, uh, people to be used in the name of maximizing utility. The subjectivist version, the neoclassical version doesn't seem to allow any interpersonal judgments of utility, both a deeply morally unsatisfying. And so, and the proponents of each one 10 to make the case for their view, mainly by pointing to the demerits of the other view. Right? And they're both right. Both of these views have serious demerits. And so part of what roles does is he changes the subject. He changes the subject, and he changes it in an interesting way. He says, luck.

Speaker 3:          31:02          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:03          The truth is we should be objectivist about some things and subjectivist about other things. And what does he mean by this? He says, luck.

Speaker 3:          31:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:15          People are substantially alike about on some dimensions and unalike on other dimensions. There's deep pluralism of values. Yes, but you know we basically have the same needs, the same physiology, the same. We tend, we tend to need the same kinds of resources. So let's focus on resources rather than on utility. Let's focus on some basic resources that everybody needs regardless of whether they're going to be intellectuals or artists or sportsman or sportswomen or politicians. There's still, there's certain things you're going to need more of rather than less off. Other things being equal sort of instrumental goods. You could think of them as well and let's focus on that. And especially in political.

Speaker 3:          32:11          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          32:12          political theory. Those are a good thing to focus on because after all we're talking about what the state might know might not do and the state, as we all know, you know, acts with blunt instruments. This idea of the government sort of putting a utility amateur and the people's tongues to find out what their utility is. That's not it. It's, it's apart from being technically problematic. It's know nobody wants that. It's morally undesirable. So you have to think about just the state as something that action with blunt instruments. And you can only really, if you want to a realistic political theory, you should focus on some basic resources in the society that the state could have some impact on. So instead of various competing definitions of utility or welfare role says let's change the subject to talking about resources, um, that, uh, have the quality a that the things that we could really imagine the state dealing with and be that an instrumentally valuable to people no matter what they turn out to one in life.

Speaker 1:          33:27          So that, that's a second reason he was important. He, she, of course, academics are not comfortable unless they create an ism word. So the ism word is resources and roles. I should, as in resources and it stops talking about welfarism stops talking about utility or welfare or the subjective experiences that people get, um, but rather the resources that they have at their disposal. So that's a second reason I think he's had his views have had a lot of staying power. People who don't like his particular resources theory have nonetheless embraced other resources. Theories. Again, sort of in the wake of roles, if you like. Okay, so what is the basic idea? What is the basic principle?

Speaker 3:          34:22          Okay,

Speaker 1:          34:22          it's, it's his general conception of justice, which he says all social values by which he means resources. As I've just said it to you now, and it's going to say that they're three while he is, he talks about liberty's opportunities, income and wealth, which he treats together. So that's three, and then a fourth one. The social bases of self respect. I'll come back to all of that in minute. I'd have been distributed equally unless an unequal distribution or any of any of all of these values is to everybody's advantage. That is the basic idea. All social values by which he means resources should be distributed equally unless an unequal distribution benefits everyone. That is the first and most general formulation of his principal. So let me just back up a little bit.

Speaker 3:          35:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          35:31          I'll go through liberties, opportunities, income, and wealth in more detail. Starting in a minute, I'm just gonna mention this. Social bases for self-respect briefly and then not talk about it anymore because of time limitations. And because rolls himself never says anything much about them. Uh,

Speaker 3:          35:53          yeah.

Speaker 1:          35:54          And what he has to say. I don't think it's very coherent. So we'll just forget about the social bases of self respect, um, for the moment. Maybe come back to them later. But so here's the thing ought to be distributed equally unless an unequal distribution works to everybody's advantage. Now you might say why, right? That's the first question, right? It's the first question you ask and roles is not going to give you a straight answer. He's not. There's not a, because

Speaker 1:          36:32          for the reason I said to, Oh yeah, his reasoning is comparative. So he says, well you could, you could say this is one candidate principal, you bring another candidate principal, like say utilitarianism. And we'll look at both from behind the veil of ignorance and see which makes more sense to beck. Okay. So that's the sense in which he has a comparative advantage argument, not a knockdown, philosophical demonstration from first principles that this must follow. So, while I do want to say that he thinks it follows from the nature of reason that you would make this choice, it's only a comparative choice and somebody could come along with something else and, um, convince you that it does better than his principal. And then he'd have to, uh, except that, so,

Speaker 3:          37:35          okay.

Speaker 1:          37:36          What he does, and this is his resources. I mean action is he, he defines these primary goods. Primary goods are these instrumental goods, these things you would, other things being equal rather have more of than less off. Uh, and the, the three we're going to focus on our liberties, opportunities and income and wealth. And I'm gonna we'll probably only manage to deal with liberty's today, but it'll give you a flavor of how his reasoning works. So what our liberties, well, that pretty much the sort of thing in the bill of rights and the American bill of rights, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of association.

Speaker 3:          38:25          MMM.

Speaker 1:          38:29          Freedom actually did participate in democratic politics is one that he talks about. Um, and he's, his principle for the distribution of liberties is, I just put it up there. He says each person has to have an equal right to the most extensive system of total extensive time. I told you this ponderous, extensive, total system of liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all. It sounds like a lot of words, not saying very much. So let me show you why it says more than it might appear to say at first sight. Let's take the example of religious freedom. So

Speaker 3:          39:26          okay,

Speaker 1:          39:27          let's say, well, should we have an established religion? How can we reason about this from behind the valve ignorance? We'd are no once the veil of ignorance is left dead, why that we're going to be Christians or Jews or Muslims or atheists or agnostics or something else, right? We don't, we don't know that. Right? So how should we think about the question of whether it should be an established religion?

Speaker 3:          40:10          Well,

Speaker 1:          40:12          and this is where his one of his, his conceptual innovations comes in. He says, the way to think about it is from the standpoint of the most adversely affected person. Cause you don't know who you're going to be. Right? So for any principal, if, if you could say, well, if I was the most adversely affected person by that principle and I would still choose it, then it starts to look like procedural expression of the categorical imperative because if the person most disadvantaged by it would choose it over the going alternatives, then presumably everybody else would. Okay. And so, so this is a misunderstanding of roles that people often get into. He says at one point, if the standpoint of justice is the standpoint of the least advantaged person, but this is not a kind of bleeding heart liberal point. He's not saying the stand point of justice is a standpoint of the least advantage person because we should feel sorry for the least advantaged person, that poor bag lady and that rich Trump isn't that disgusting to contemplate. That's not his point.

Speaker 1:          41:40          It's a self interested point, completely self interested point. He's saying you figure out what you would choose in this situation of turning out to be the most disadvantaged person. That is a stand point of justice. Not because we feel badly for the most disadvantaged person, but because we want a universalized about principle. Okay. That's the point. So it's not, it's not that he's, as I said, it's not a bleeding heart point. It's a self interest point. It's it's self interest in the service of universalize ability. It's to get people to pick a principle that they would affirm no matter what.

Speaker 3:          42:26          Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:27          That's the sense in which roles thinks of himself as a content. Okay, now let's come back to religious freedom.

Speaker 3:          42:38          Wow.

Speaker 1:          42:42          If we had an established church and you turned out to be a member of the established religion, you would be completely happy. But if we had an established church and you'd turned out to be a nonbeliever or believer in a different religion, you wouldn't be happy. Right? You'd be less happy, at least then the person who turns out to belong to the established religion. That part's straightforward. But that's not the interesting comparison. It's not the illuminating comparison. So Raul says, think about it like this. The question's whether or not to have an established church established religion. Right? So think about the, the person who is not a member of the established religion in a world in which there is an established religion,

Speaker 3:          43:46          right?

Speaker 1:          43:49          Versus the believer in a world in which there is no established religion. Because if, if, if, if you suppose you're an atheist, right? And we have no established religion, you're happy. But if on the other hand are the fundamentalist is unhappy.

Speaker 3:          44:10          Right?

Speaker 1:          44:12          But so for Rawls, the relevant comparison is would you rather be a fundamentalist in a regime where there's no established religion

Speaker 3:          44:25          or

Speaker 1:          44:27          and nonbeliever in a regime where there is an established religion.

Speaker 3:          44:32          Okay.

Speaker 1:          44:33          And his argument for this established religion is that the believer in the disestablishment regime has more religious freedom than the nonbeliever and the established machine. Right. To make this concrete fundamentalists have more religious freedom in America than non fundamentalists have in Saudi Arabia.

Speaker 3:          44:59          Yeah. Well, Iran.

Speaker 1:          45:02          So the reason to prefer the reason to prefer this establishment of religion is that if you're trying to maximize the religious freedom of the least advantaged person, it's you have to look at the least advantage person in all of the possible regimes of governing religion. Right? And so the defense of the establishment clause of the u s he doesn't talk about this example, but I'm, it's my example, but it's his logic, right? If you said the roles in defense of the establishment clause of the u s constitution, that's what it would be. It's not, you know, fundamentalist. Often Christian fundamentalists often criticize the establishment clause, particularly in the way it's been interpreted by the courts. They say it's presented as neutral among religions and it's not, it's not neutral because it works. You know, people who think they shouldn't be an established religion getting exactly what they want, but we who think that should be, don't get exactly what we want. So it's not neutral. Correct. That correct. It's not neutral. And roles actually contributes to confusion here because sometimes he talks about his theory as as neutral.

Speaker 3:          46:26          It's not neutral.

Speaker 1:          46:28          And the, the, the requirement is not that it should be neutral, but rather that it should give the most extensive religious freedom

Speaker 3:          46:38          okay.

Speaker 1:          46:39          To the person who's most disadvantaged in either system. So as I said, the key point is that the believer,

Speaker 3:          46:50          okay,

Speaker 1:          46:50          has more religious freedom. If you have something like the u s s establishment clause, then the nonbeliever has, when you have a fundamentalist regime that's the claim. And so you want to give the most extensive system of religious freedom compatible with a light system for all

Speaker 3:          47:14          right?

Speaker 1:          47:15          And the way you get compared with the light system for all is to look at it from the standpoint of the most adversely affected personnel, the least advantaged person in any case. So that's the basic way in which he reasons. And that's why these, this sort of rather

Speaker 1:          47:39          empty sounding phrase here, that is this first principle, uh, actually has more content than might appear to be the PSI at first sight to be the case. Right? So it's, it's, um, the standpoint of justice is a standpoint of the most disadvantaged person, not because of being a bleeding heart, but because you want a universalized about principle and we, it's just the cake cutting you giving the knife to the right person is getting the last slice. You say, pick the system that will give you the most religious freedom when you just, when you later discover what your beliefs are,

Speaker 3:          48:21          right?

Speaker 1:          48:22          And that is the principle you should affirm. And that is why I, religious fundamentalists should choose disestablish the establishment clause of the u s okay. Now somebody might come along with some other principal and show that it does better and then we'd have to go through the process again. But, so that, that's the basic structure of Rawlsian reasoning. If you lie about principles of Justice, okay, we'll pause there and pick up on Wednesday.
