Speaker 1:          00:01          So today we're gonna talk about majority rule and democratic competition. Whenever we think about democracy, there is this automatic, almost reflexive impulse to associate democracy with majority rule. We saw last time that was one of the things that frighten Madison and his contemporaries that they wanted to limit the power of majority factions as he called them, limit the power of majority rule. But we think, um, today reflexively that majority rule confers legitimacy of some sort on collective decisions. And what our agenda today is to, to dig into why, why it is that anybody might think majority rule has some important normative property. Any, anyone have any suggestion as to why it might, why might majority, why should we care? You know, the, the endless recounts in Florida in 2002 who really had the majority, what's a big deal about majority rule? Why should we care? Any, any takers?

Speaker 2:          01:27          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:32          I guess it was like a somewhat utilitarian flavor to that.

Speaker 1:          01:36          Oh, somewhat. What utilitarian flavor. Tell a Tarion flavor. So That's interesting. There might be a utilitarian justification for majority rule. Um, just say a little more about what you have in mind.

Speaker 3:          01:49          Um, because like if the majority of the societies consents to a certain policy or approves of a certain person, it's kind of like they're making the judgment that having this person having this policy would increase their happiness or their satisfaction with society the most.

Speaker 1:          02:05          So maximizing governant by majority rule might in some sense maximize you tell it in the society. That's a, that's a certainly an interesting iPod stasis and I'll revisit it in this lecture. Any other suggestions about majority rule? No.

Speaker 2:          02:28          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:29          Going once. Twice.

Speaker 1:          02:32          Okay. Gone. All right. We will, we'll revisit. Um, we'll revisit this utilitarian thinking because the, it's, I think it's a very good observation to make because although it's not explicit in much of the discussion of majority rule, I think it is implicit and we'll, we'll come back to that. The traditional justification for majority rule was that it somehow identified the well of the people that democracy reflects, embodies and it expresses the will of the people. But of course, you know, that just puts it one step further back. What is the well of the people? How do you know the will of the people when you trip over it? One of the canonical formulations of this idea is in John Jack Russo's social contract where he says there's a great deal of difference between the wheel of all what all individuals want and the general will, the general well studies only the common interest while the will of all studies private interest and is indeed no more than the sum of individual desires.

Speaker 1:          03:48          But if we take away from these same wells, the pluses and minuses which cancel each other out, the balance, which remains is the general will. If we take away from the individual wells, the pluses and minuses which cancel each other out, the bear balance, which remains is the general well. So people have spent hundreds of years trying to figure out whether that makes any sense, whether this notion that you find in Rousseau of pluses and minuses canceling one another out makes any sense. And what sense could it make? How would we know? As I said, how would we know the general will if we fell over it? And, um, it's often been the case that people have tended to associate the general will with the idea of the, the will of the majority. But going all the way back to the 18th century, there has been the contrarion mpulse first noticed by a philosopher called condor say at the end of the 18th century.

Speaker 1:          05:10          But that has since preoccupied many theorists of democracy. And that is that, well actually majority rule doesn't even necessarily reflect the will of the majority. What condos saying noticed was, was a very simple fact, which is suppose you have a society where there are three voters and each voter has a preference over, uh, three different yeah, policies. So in this example, voted number one prefers a to B and B to c voted number c preferred number two proposed a c to a and a to B. And number three prefers B to c and c to add, well, you, what Condo say noticed was you get a paradoxical result because you have a majority for a over B, you have a majority for B of a c, but then you have a majority for c over. Hey, and that seems like a contradiction because if you, if you dial back through your notes too, when we were discussing, um, basic properties of rationality, when remember when we were talking about indifference curves and all of that, this seems to violate the principle of trans activity because you have a majority for a over B.

Speaker 1:          06:39          You have a majority firm for B oversee, and then you have a majority of seat for c over a. So it seems like what our individual preferences can be rational. Our collective pressure references might be irrational in the sense that they contradict themselves. And so several things follow from this or, um, or thought to follow from this, at least one is that this condo say noticed in the 18th century, but a famous indeed Nobel prize in any economist called Kenneth Arrow proved the theorem in 1951 in a little book called social choice and individual values that this is a perfectly general result. And so if you have modest pluralism of preferences, which we, we were assuming, remember when we talked about cross cutting cleavages um, on Monday we were assuming it's important for democracy, diversity of tastes and preferences, then you can always get this result with majority rule.

Speaker 1:          07:51          So that's, so that has a number of unsettling implications because it suggests there's no general will identified by the majority. On the contrary, if, if things are put in one order, you'll get one result. But if things are put in a different order, you'll get a different result. So, you know, the white parliamentary committees often work, um, you have emotion and then you have amendments to the emotion. You always vote on the amendments first. And then the final motion last, so that another important Theorem, uh, approved by somebody called Gerald Kramer. Um, about 20 years after arrows basically says, if you let me determine the order of voting, I, he, what? Uh, what, what are the, the amendments are and what order will end vote on them? I can get any outcome. All I have to do is know your preferences and control the order of voting. And I can get a majority to appear to support any outcome. So this is, this is suggests set majority rule can be manipulated. Now you might say, well, and when, when millions of people are voting,

Speaker 2:          09:11          yeah,

Speaker 1:          09:11          they, nobody's really controlling the agenda and that specific a sense. And nobody has all of that information about everybody's preferences. So people can't manipulate the outcome. That might be true as well. But it also suggests that there shouldn't be much moral authority attaching to the outcome if we know, yeah, nobody manipulated that, that we, that, that see wins. But if things had been done in a different order, B might have wine or a might have one in this circumstance. So why should we attach any particular moral authority to the idea that c one, we shouldn't, it just an arbitrary resolved. So footnote to this, if one important takeaway from Arrow's theorem is you should always be the last person to interview for a job,

Speaker 1:          10:06          right? Because if they're cyclical preferences among the interview is over the candidates, you want the others to bump each other off and then you come along at the end, right? So don't say you didn't learn anything useful today. You certainly learned that they call you for an interview. Say Well, could I come in three weeks? Why don't you interview around the candidates first? So, um, majority rule if there is such a thing as the general, well majority rule doesn't seem to identify it. And the public choice literature that came out of economics in the 1950s and 1960s basically converged on that proposition it said there is no such thing as a social welfare function, which is just a econ speak for saying there is no such thing as a general. Well or if there is a general well we don't know what decision rule would identify it and a huge amount of ink has been spelled in trying to figure out what

Speaker 2:          11:16          yeah,

Speaker 1:          11:19          what decision rule might identify unambiguously something that we would feel morally comfortable calling the general. Well, um, and I don't think anybody has succeeded definitively at that task

Speaker 1:          11:38          lock. We always come back to lock in this course lock has a somewhat different defense of majority rule. Now you might think that's weird because most people think of Loc as somebody who defended rights, right? We think of if you go and read about the debates on the constitution, the lock-ins versus the Republicans. If those of you have taken a history course, the lock Ian's where the people who if wanted to create the bill of rights defend against the majority, uh, and so on. But in fact if you go and read lock, what you find is that he's a staunch defender of majority rule. He says for when any number of men have by the consent of every of every individual made a community. They have thereby made that community one body with the power to act as one body, which is only by the will and determination of the majority doesn't say why for that which act, any con for that which acts any community being only the consent of the individuals of it and being necessary to that which is one body to move one way.

Speaker 1:          12:53          It is necessary. The body should move that way. Whether the greater force carries it, which is the consent of the majority or else it is impossible, it should act or confined or continue one body, one community. It is. So he's saying that it's necessary. The body should move that way whether the greater force carries it, which is the consent of the majority or else it's impossible. It should continue to act one body of one community which the consent of every individual that United intuit agreed that it should and so everyone is bound by that consent to be concluded by the majority and therefore we see that in assemblies empowered to act by positive laws where no number is set by that positive law, which empowers them. The act of the majority passes for the act of the whole and of course determines as having by the law in nature of nature and reason the power of the whole.

Speaker 1:          14:01          So that's locks, defense of majority rule. It's not that it identifies some general, well, it's really an argument about power, right? He's basically saying, look, once you have a community, somebody who's going to win, it's a little bit like Nozick saying, you know, once you have those at independents out there, somebody's going to force them to join just a real politic argument that the power of the majority's going to determine what the community does. And indeed, if we delve more deeply into other things that Locke says, he basically says, look, if you don't like what the government does, you can oppose. But if nobody agrees with you, you should, as we discussed earlier in the course, you should expect your reward in the next slide. If everybody agrees or if a majority agrees with you, then you can have 1688, right? You can change the government. So this seems to be an argument about the legitimacy of the majority that is very, uh, hard nosed, realistic judgment about politics. Not a moral claim that the majority has any particular intrinsic property that gives it the right to govern, right? It's just saying, well, you know, there it is. Um, the majority is going to flex its muscles and if, uh, if it's not attended to it's going to win.

Speaker 2:          15:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:42          No, I think that we will see lock gets actually a lot closer to the truth of the desirability of th of majority rule then Russo date or the people who are trying to come up with a notion of the general well or what modern economists would call a social welfare function. And the way you could think about this argument, particularly in light of the question, the observation about the relationship between majority rule and utilitarianism is that I think, I think the best way to think of what Locke is doing here, it's a kind of negative utilitarianism, uh, or at least a cousin of negative utilitarianism. We generally think of negative utilitarianism as the doctrine that um, we should minimize pain as opposed to positive utilitarianism, which is maximize pleasure. We didn't make that discussion, that distinction when we talked about Bentham, but it's there in the contemporary literature.

Speaker 1:          16:46          So this is a cousin, I think of negative libertarian as a negative utilitarianism in the sense that I think that Locke thinks as of majority rule and indeed of resistance to power as a way of limiting the possibility of domination, limiting the possibility of domination, and he's saying the majority can. You can resist power if power is dominating you, but you're only going to win if you're in the majority if you have the greater force. But why is majority rule the instrument for limiting the possibility of domination? Why should we think of majority rule as having that propensity? Anyone got a suggestion? Why should we think that majority rule all things considered would limit the possibility of domination? Just a hard question. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          18:01          Well, it seems to go back to the crosscutting cleavages that we talked about the other day, that if you're going to be in the majority, you don't know if you're going to be in the minority and other things. So you would eliminate the domination that you put out. You wouldn't want to be a dominant player in presence for fear that there'd be other domineering presence is and other spheres.

Speaker 1:          18:19          I think that's exactly right. I think you've hit the nail on the head. He said, well it's related to the clause cross cutting cleavages and one's not knowing whether or not, um, the policies that get enacted are going to be the policies that you want or whether you're going to regard them as being imposed on you and dominating you. So the, the people, I'll come back to your point in a minute, but as, as background to an industry show, I think why exactly. Exactly why you're right. And what turns on that you said, think about another prize winning economist who's theorized about politics. This is a book published in 1962 by the economist James Buchanan and the political scientists, Gordon Tulloch for which Buchanan and got the Nobel prize in 1986 and Tulloch was not happy. Um, and that was the argument was, well, we don't have any, uh, a Nobel prize for, for political science.

Speaker 1:          19:30          That's why they gave it to Buchanan. Although you may know that last year, um, in a slap, in a slap at their own discipline. In fact, for the first time, the Nobel prize committee did give than over our price to a political scientist, to a woman by the name of Eleanor Ostrum at the University of Indiana. But that was then, and this is now in 1996, uh, Buchanan and got the recognition and Telec was not happy. Uh, and he as he widely let it be known. So he has the intuition. It's, it's, it's, it, it is behind the veil of ignorance. This book, interestingly, longtime before roles wrote 1962 but the basic ideas behind the veil of ignorance, what, how would you think about the decision rules that should govern you? How can you reason about that? And they said, wow,

Speaker 2:          20:31          okay.

Speaker 1:          20:32          What you have to think about is two things. One is how, how likely is it that the society's going to do something you don't like and what can you do about,

Speaker 1:          20:49          okay. And related to that, you have to think how much do you care? Because some import, some decisions are much more important to you than other decisions. Why does it matter how much you care? Because being involved in decision making takes up time, effort, energy that you could spend doing other things. So if it's some utterly trivial decision, you're not going to want to spend a lot of time on it. But if it's a really important decision then you'll be willing to spend time on it in order to make sure your rights are protected. Okay. So they make a distinction between, first of all what they call external costs. And the idea here is that

Speaker 2:          21:36          yeah,

Speaker 1:          21:40          as the number of people in the society goes up, the chances, the chances that you're going to have some decision imposed on you that you don't like also goes up because there are all kinds of decisions that people could make. Right? On the other hand, there are decision making cost too. And as the number of people and the society goes up, the decision making costs increase as well because they're more people to talk to, to negotiate with and so on. And so what you have to think about is the summer, those two things, the, the, the, how important is it to you? Right?

Speaker 2:          22:32          Okay.

Speaker 1:          22:33          How important is it? Is it to you to participate in decision making? It's going to be how much do you, how much do you care about the result and how much time you're going to have to spend on the result. And what they said in a kind of utilitarian calculus, they said what you're going to want to do is add a mop. So you're going to want to minimize the sum of the external costs and the decision making costs, right? You're going to want to minimize

Speaker 2:          23:04          that.

Speaker 1:          23:06          So when a decision is completely unimportant to you,

Speaker 2:          23:11          yeah,

Speaker 1:          23:14          then you won't want to spend a lot of time. But when a decision is really important to you, you will be willing to spend time. Okay? And so then they said, well sir, how should we think about the organization of Society for questions that people think are really important? We should have something like unanimity role because after all, unanimity rule is a veto of one.

Speaker 2:          23:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          23:42          Right? Anybody, if you, if you have unanimity rule, it's like the parade. Oh, principal, anybody can veto everybody's agreement has to be gotten in the limiting case. If you had absolute unanimity rule, you can't do anything uh, without, uh, that. Okay. Whereas for less important decisions, this point here where you minimize when you're minimizing the sum of external costs and decision making costs, while there'll be something less than unanimity role, it might be a two thirds rule and even less important things you might say, majority rule and even less important things than that. You might say, you know, let the bureaucrats decide. It's just not worth my time. Okay. So Fort Buchanan and Telec, there's no presumption that there's any particular importance attaching to majority rule. On the contrary, we should say for the most important things, we should start with unanimity rule and then we can, we can come down the ladder of all we can think about, you know, just steadily declining a super majorities as things become less important to us.

Speaker 1:          25:05          And so the, the, the argument was that for constitutional questions, it should be something very close to unanimity rule. And we should have entrenched was semi and trenched clauses that are virtually impossible to change. And something that more so in whether it's they're telling a story that more or less reflects the structure of the American constitution where amending the Constitution does take, um, very hard to get super majorities, but regular legislation takes a lot less. And it's simply this calculation, this self interested calculation that I'm lead. You too often, uh, often be willing to go with majority rule and there's nothing more to be said about it than that. So now we come to your observation and your observation is basically the observation that you can, and then Telecar wrong that Buchanan and Telec are wrong because they confuse unanimity is a state of affairs in the world where we all agree about something with unanimity as a decision rule.

Speaker 1:          26:20          And this, this, your observation was first made by Brian Berry, who sadly died last year in a very good book called political argument and was developed by Douglas Ray who teaches here in som into a important articles in the American political science review. And what Barry and ray pointed out was exactly what this gentleman pointed out, um, a few minutes ago, which is the hall Buchanan and Salak story assumes we have, we have an agreement at the baseline. The hall Buchanan and talk story assumes that everybody's happy with the initial state of affairs. Uh, and so then we say, well, so we started that baseline and then we say the things that are most important to you from that baseline, we will give what cried unanimity rule and give you, uh, every, everyone in the room, essentially a veto. Right? But then we'll work down from that. But what ray and Barry said was, wow,

Speaker 2:          27:32          okay,

Speaker 1:          27:32          what if we say that behind this veil of ignorance, we don't know whether we're going to like the status quo or not. Maybe we will, maybe we won't. But if you don't want to give any special status to the status quo, then you shouldn't buy us decisions to the status quo. Because maybe it'll turn out that you don't want the status quo and then you're stuck with something that's impossible to change, right? And so, um, what Barry and ray showed was, well actually

Speaker 1:          28:15          if you assume behind a veil of ignorance that your is likely to be against the status quo as in favor of his status quo, then you would choose majority rule or something very close to it. So I know if the number of people in this society is even, you would choose n over two plus one or Nana and over two minus one. If you are wanting to minimize the probability that a decision's going to be imposed upon you not knowing whether or not it was the decision favored by the status quo. So there's a kind of veil of ignorance logic in the Buchanan and in there, ray and Barry critique a big cannon and Tagalog, which says that the presumption should be in favor of majority rule or something very close to it and less. We want to buy us the whole system toward the status quo.

Speaker 1:          29:10          Uh, and we don't actually have any Altima at good reason for doing that. It was even if somebody at some constitutional convention preferred to entrench whatever it is, the right to bear arms 200 years later, we might not take the view that we want to entrench that, but now it becomes impossibly hard to change. Okay. So if if you say behind the veil of ignorance, we're going to be as likely to oppose as to support. There does seem to be a kind of negative utilitarian logic which says if I want to minimize the likelihood of having decisions I'd are like imposed upon me. I would prefer majority rule, uh, to the garden alternatives. Well, that's all very well and I think that's the barrier and ray argument is pretty robust. It's certainly stood up for what now close to half a century. It's regarded as conventional wisdom on this point.

Speaker 1:          30:13          I'm still in all, it doesn't tell us a lot about the dynamics of actual politics. How does competitive democracy play out in when we thinking about how actual political systems, actual democratic systems operate. And you'll recall that from Monday's lecture. I said to you that Robert Dahl was the most important democratic theorist of the second half of the 20th century, but I didn't talk about the first half of the 20th century. And, and I think the most important democratic theorists of the first half of the 20th century who in many ways dall built upon was actually an economist by the name of Joseph Schumpeter. Economist had a lot of influence in democratic theory in the 20th century. Schumpeter wrote a book called capitalism, socialism and democracy, which he published in 1942, eight years before his death. And, um, most of that book is actually completely unremarkable. Most of that book is a long and read the tortured critique of Karl Marx.

Speaker 1:          31:28          But the, the piece, the piece of it we're focusing on are those two little chapters called the classical theory of democracy and another theory of democracy. And the, I should say that those two little chapters that may be the most influential, uh, writings about democracy in the real world, uh, that have came out of the 20th century. Now, it should also be sad just as, as a prefatory matter that the, the, the title of the first chapter of those two chapters is misleading because what he calls the classical theory of democracy is actually a neoclassical theory. It is Russo's idea of the general will, which we now know to be, um, chimerical. Um, but you know, from Monday's lecture that Russo's idea of the general will was actually a neoclassical adaptation because the ancient Greek idea was ruling and being ruled in turn, right? So that, so showing paid his act critique of what he calls the classical theory of democracy, we should remember is actually a neoclassical 18th century idea. But he starts from the proposition that the, the critique of the idea that general will is valid. There's no such thing. There is no social welfare function as an economist would put it. And he says he Shum pay. This says, let's think about democracy in a fundamentally different way. Let's define it as follows. The democratic method is that institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions in which individuals acquire the power to decide by means of a competitive struggle. For the people's vote.

Speaker 2:          33:31          Okay.

Speaker 1:          33:32          And now he's going to develop this idea in that second little chapter with an analogy to the market. He's going to think about democracy as shopping. Schumpeter says, look, think about democracy. Think about the the Po polity as an analog of the economy. What do we have in the economy and what do we have in the policy? Well, one thing we have in the economy is consumers,

Speaker 2:          34:19          right?

Speaker 1:          34:22          In the what are, what is the political analog of consumers? Any guesses? What's the political analog of consumers? Voters. Voters. What? Another thing we have in the economy is firms. What's the political animal? I got firms. Anybody. You have the mic guess various candidates for positions. Yeah. Parties. Good enough.

Speaker 2:          34:57          Okay.

Speaker 1:          34:58          Firms make profits. What is the political analog of profits?

Speaker 1:          35:05          Whoever wins the election hellos. Why did they get, how did they get votes? Exactly. So firms, one profits, parties, one votes. Then firms produce products. What? What is produced in the polity? Various party platforms. Platforms. Yeah. And legislation. And so when we think of the doctrine of consumer sovereignty in economics, what would the political analog of at bay this one leap out at you? But okay, it's the idea of democratic legitimacy is the equivalent. When we say there's consumer sovereignty and markets, there's demo, there's democratic legitimacy in the policy. And so we have this, this basic parallel between the economic system where firms are competing, firms are competing for profits, right? And they, they engage in a competitive struggle for the consumers dollar to paraphrase Schumpeter, right? And parties are competing for votes and they engage in a competitive and a struggle for the people's vote.

Speaker 1:          36:20          And democracy is not about participation or deliberation or all of the things that people try to identify with. It's essentially, as I said, it's about shopping. You shop for policies and politicians and policies. Injustice, same way as you shop for iPods and Maseratis or whatever it is you buy. Okay? This is how we should think about democracy. Hugely influential, right? Hugely influential. And that what disciplines the elites, what disciplines the elites is the, that creates the democratic legitimacy. Or maybe I should've put democratic accountability there is the fact that the, that the voter can kick the bums out, right? It's Gordon Brown's worrying about this for the next few weeks, right? The British voters, can he have 'em out, right? That is what disciplines the political elites. That is what prevents them ultimately from exercising domination. And so we think about,

Speaker 2:          37:41          okay,

Speaker 1:          37:43          we think about a competitive system driven by politicians who are competing for votes. Turns out there's a big tradition in American political science of studying this. That goes back to an a, again, another economist is kind of depressing all these economists, but there it is, uh, in 1929 who, who, uh, hotelling who wrote a paper trying to explain why is it, why is it that if you, if you look at a town, any town you'll find target and

Speaker 2:          38:21          mmm,

Speaker 1:          38:27          you'll find a what, what's another, what you'll find a shores and stop and shop right next to each other on main street, uh, and downs, develop this into a political argument. He basically, he said, imagine you've got, um, a continuum here from left to right. So, uh, that people with, with ideas, this is ideology. People on the left, I have people on the writer here, well, we should think the population's more or less normally distributed, right? So most people are in the middle and some people are at the two extremes.

Speaker 2:          39:07          Well,

Speaker 1:          39:09          if you have two political parties,

Speaker 2:          39:17          okay,

Speaker 1:          39:19          where are they going to head for? They're going ahead for the median voter because that's where most of the votes are, right? So

Speaker 2:          39:28          yeah,

Speaker 1:          39:28          you might have differences of opinion within the parties. I'll come back to that in a minute. But basically, um, whoops,

Speaker 2:          39:38          why we

Speaker 1:          39:40          getting too far ahead of ourselves? Yeah. Parties are going to head for the median voter because that's where the boats are. You know, we said when they asked to wherever it was, why do you rob banks? Because that's where the money is. Politicians are going to go for the median voter, right? That's where the boats are. Now, of course, they could be wrong. They're going to guess. So for example, 1964 Goldwater runs, um, running for president, um, thinks that the median voter is way over here, but he's wrong. So he loses then, you know, 1980 Ronald Reagan basically,

Speaker 2:          40:39          mmm.

Speaker 1:          40:42          Runs on exactly the same platform that Goldwater had lost on in 1964 and everybody says this crazy right wing, not, it's going to be creamed. We, we saw that in 1964 but either because he knew something, uh, or because he was lucky or some combination. Uh, it turned out that between 1964 and 1980, the median voter had moved and Jimmy Carter was wrong about where the median voter was. Okay. So, um, generally speaking, other things equal, the parties would converge to the median voter or at least where they believe the median voter is and the people who get it right, we'll win right now that seems to have the implication

Speaker 2:          41:34          that particularly as polling gets better and better so you don't make the kind of mistakes the Democrats made in 1980 or the Republicans made in 1964, the potluck parties are going to keep offering exactly the same start offering exactly the same policies. Right. And indeed, if you look at the, I didn't, I don't know how much attention you folks are paying to the British election, but basically they're offering the same policies. Um, they're saying they're both saying the other. So going to lie to you about what they're going to do, but we're going to keep the national health service, we're going to, we're not going to cut this. We're not going to cut that. We're not going to do this to taxes because they've done all the polling. They know what the median voter once. And so they basically offering the same policy. So I'll come back to what that means for political competition, uh, in a minute. Um, but okay,

Speaker 1:          42:38          if that competing, if that basically offering the same policies, what are they competing over? What are they putting in front of the electric? If that basically both doing the same thing. They're going to compete over things like, you know, character assassination. They're going to say he's a vote. He vote for me cause he's alive. He says he won't cut the hell service buddy. Well, the other one will say, he says he won't raise taxes, but he will. They said, well, he's this honorable, he was involved in this, that and the other scandal. That's what they're going to do. They couldn't compete over personalities right now. One way you could,

Speaker 2:          43:29          okay.

Speaker 1:          43:29          Imagine something that would change that is if there were other variables that kept these parties apart. So for example, we have primaries now in the u s and of course the primary voters on the, on the Democratic Party R. Dot. Over here probably normally distributed and the primary voters in the Republican Party are here. If you have to win the primary first, then you're going to get pulled down here and the republic is going to have pulled over there, right? And so what happens is if you have some other force that pulls the parties apart,

Speaker 2:          44:09          yeah,

Speaker 1:          44:09          then you might get competition of a policy. Some people say, oh, it's bad to have primaries because if you have primaries, um, the activists get control of the parties and the extremists in both party. You know, the unions control what the Democratic Party does. Uh, and the far right controls what the Republican Party does. It's true. But the flip side of that is that when, when the general election comes, you actually have competition of a policies because the parties have been pulled apart by the fact that they had to win these primaries first. Now there are other bad sides of primaries, but, but part of that point here is you need to see that what it is that parties compete over can change, right? So when we put in the general election, the parties have been pulled somewhat apart. Um, so if, if you have something in the structure of political parties, it could be primaries, it could be a strong, uh, control of the party selection process by the leadership or something like that.

Speaker 1:          45:20          Then you will get, um, competition of a policy. Now you could see some people would say that's better because people get a clear choice as opposed to just character assassination and that sort of thing. It's actually better for them to compete over policies. Notice though, if you do have strong parties that it kept up ideologically apart and you have competition of a policy, you can get results. Like in Britain, British railways have been nationalized and d nationalized three times in the 20th century, you know, because labor comes in and nationalized as them. And then the Tories come in and d nationalized them. Um, so you get policy alternation and that could be good or bad. It's not bad. It's a different thing to compete over. So you can have competition over personalities, you can have competition over policies. And of course you can have, as we do in our system, you can have competition of a pork if you have a system in which, um, you have individual constituencies like we do in the u s you have congressional staff constituencies, and then you have states, each representative is really looking for, not the national median voter, but the median voter in their district.

Speaker 1:          46:44          Right? Or in this state, that's who they're serving. Right. And so there's a lot of literature about whether it's better to have proportional representation where you have basically one national constituency or whether you should have a system in which politicians compete with one another as to who's going to bring more pork back to our district. Okay. So I mentioned these things only so that you're aware that once we talk about, uh, political competition, we haven't settled, uh, what it is that parties compete over. Um, but champagne, he did an address these because shown pay to ultimately didn't, he didn't care really whether they were competing over personalities, policies or pork. The point was that they were competing and they wanted to throw one another out. This is the system to Harken back to Monday's lecture. This is a system in which ambition really counteract ambition, whereas separation of powers and all that for the reasons doll gave doesn't really work. There's no mechanism, right? But this, this creates a mechanism for ambition to counteract ambition. So Schumpeter and Darla, much more sympathetic to the idea of pluralism and crosscutting cleavages and a competitive struggle with the people's vote than they are to institutional checks. And balances to discipline elites. Of course, there are problems with Schumpeter. I'll just mention them briefly because we're running short of time and you can pursue them, uh, in section, but one is

Speaker 1:          48:35          year and a half, two parties or maybe three parties or for parties. It's all it got polycystic competition. It's not, um, a very thorough going form of competition. So that's one thing to think about. Secondly, um, this whole thing doesn't address the role of money in politics. You will see this, uh, in sharp relief in the state of Connecticut in the next eight months were um, the Republican, what the likely Republican nominee for Chris Dodd Senate seat has already announced. She's going to spend $50 million of her own money on her campaign. And so it Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who's the likely Democrat has to raise a lot of money. So it's, it's not necessarily competitive struggle for the people's vote, but rather struggle for money. And that has implications, uh, which you should think about. Notice third, that this Shump Astarria and story completely be values participation after all a buys into the Buchanan and [inaudible] definition of the problem where we saw participation was defined as a cost, a cost of, if you have to spend time participating in politics, it's time you could be spending driving your Maserati and you'd rather be doing that. That's the assumption, right? How good an assumption is that maybe participation is inherently valuable, then you have to think about that.

Speaker 2:          50:12          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          50:13          And then finally, it really is a minimal conception of democracy right now. Some people have operationalized shown, paid it to say, and this is true in the, in the comparative literature about, about new democracies that we can't call a system of democracy until the government has twice lost an election and given up power. Um, this is called, she'll sometimes called the [inaudible] two turnover test. Famous Harvard political scientist Dude recently died called Samuel Huntington, came up with the two turnover test. We can call something a democracy unless it's been as turnover at least twice. Uh, in one way. That's a stiff test. Japan didn't meet it until very recently. The U s didn't meet it until 1840 India didn't meet it until recently. South Africa, which people crow about as a new democracy has yet to me. Did we don't know what would happen if the ANC lost an election?

Speaker 1:          51:16          Would they give up hour? Maybe, maybe not. Okay. So in one respect, it's a robust test, but, but people criticize it as being minimal. Say really this more to democracy than that. And we'll come back to that question next week, but what I want you to take ways, I think the enduring insight, um, of the Schumpeterian model that really starts with locks. Linking lock was very prescient. He saw three centuries ahead, linking of majority rule to this idea of resisting domination, that non domination, this idea of resisting domination, however you institutionalize it and operationalize it and all of that. That is the basic animating ideal of democracy will pick up from there on Monday.
