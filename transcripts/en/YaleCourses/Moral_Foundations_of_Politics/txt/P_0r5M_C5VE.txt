Speaker 1:          00:02          Okay this morning we are going to have finished talking about marks and we're going to focus on the failures of Marxism and the legacies of Marxism and the failures are connected to the legacies and important ways that will unfold as we proceed with today's discussion. I began this already on Monday by talking about the difficulties with Marx's assumptions about scarcity and super abundance and we saw that just as male couldn't banish politics from the, from politics through the mechanism of a neutral definition of harm. Mark's is unable to banish politics from politics by somehow wishing of conflict could in principle go away. We saw that that notion of super abundance that informs his communist new Utopia is incoherent in principle and that means that distributive conflict is endemic to human society. No matter how much wealth there is and some principles for the distribution of income and wealth are going to have to be argued about and defended regardless of what is produced in society or what could be produced in society.

Speaker 1:          01:29          The second failure of Marxism as well known, but we should nonetheless mention it, which is that his, his historical predictions turned out to be hopelessly wide of the mark. Not only was he wrong in 1830 and 1848 when he thought the communist revolutions were about to sweep through Europe. Um, they were both a not communist and be quickly reversed. In any event, uh, within a couple of years, um, his larger historical predictions were, were also wrong. He thought Communism would come socialist revolutions for reasons that you now know because we've worked through the macro theory, he thought that socialist revolutions would occur in advanced capitalist systems that had become uncompetitive because of the replacement of competitive capitalism with, with capitalism, with monopoly capitalism. And in fact, where we saw revolutions bearing the Communists label was in peasant societies and in Russia and in China, um, or in, in eastern Europe, in countries where it was actually more or less imposed from the outside, um, by the Soviet Union after World War Two, we didn't really see any society go through the sort of path march was thinking of and his larger teleological theory of history, namely from feudalism to capitalism to socialism to communism, it simply didn't happen.

Speaker 1:          03:00          And as the reversals of the revolutions of 1830 and 1848, uh, remind us on a smaller scale, Mark's is bigger idea that there's some purpose or direction to history seems questionable by the first decades of the 21st century. History doesn't go in a single direction. Um, and this is a theme to which we will return, but you can see, um, movements toward more egalitarian systems and then movements away from egalitarian systems. You can see democracy created and then you can see it collapse into authoritarianism so that there isn't a single TV or logical, uh, or direction or focus of history of the sort that march was looking for. So on the big, big predictions, Marxism doesn't look very good from the vantage point of the 21st century, but some of his smaller predictions were also wrong, uh, in ways that in some, some respects more interesting for our purposes.

Speaker 1:          04:10          And so I'm going to go back through, um, some of his arguments and focus on things that were wrong with those arguments that we can nonetheless, George some interesting conclusions about as we go on our way and examining the moral foundations of politics. And, and I'm going to start with his macro theory and talk about some difficulties with that. And then I'm going to go backwards into the micros theory. So we're doing the reverse, if you like, of what we did on the way in, we started with the micro theory and we saw how that generated the macro theory. Now we're going backwards through the macro theory and then we will go back into the labor theory of value and the assumptions about workmanship that underlie it that he took over from Loc and secularized and modernized. As you know, so if you'll recall from Monday's lecture Marxists macro theory was an invisible hand theory like Smith's, except it was a malevolent invisible hand where a Smith's was a benign invisible hand, and one element of it was that argument about the potential for liquidity crises, that there would be the possibility that people would hoard money, that money would stop flowing through the system and the system would thereby become sclerotic.

Speaker 1:          05:36          It isn't. It is the case that capitalist systems have the potential for liquidity crises, but one of the things Mark's greatly underestimated was the capacity of capitalists states in capitalist societies, states in capitalist societies to address things like liquidity crises and other things as well. We'll see. It's almost as if he didn't really take it seriously when he and angles said in the communist manifesto that the state in capitalist society is the executive committee of the bourgeoisie. He underestimated what the state could actually do to preserve capitalism. Um, a good example in the early years of this system was lik huge liquidity crisis in Mexico where, uh, the whole Mexico Mexican economy was on the verge of complete collapse. But the western governments led by the, the United States put together a $50 billion package to resolve that, to pump liquidity into the Mexican economy until the crisis was over and they succeeded.

Speaker 1:          06:48          And so we didn't see the kind of collapse in the maximum Mexican economy that that liquidity crisis, uh, had the potential to create. So the, the argument about the potential for liquidity crises is valid, but we have no particular reason to think they can't be managed. Once the sources of liquidity crises are understood and governments have the levers available to them, uh, that were, uh, made available to the Mexican government in, in the, uh, during the Clinton administration in the US. Secondly, Mark's has this argument about the declining tendency in the rate of profit. As I said to you, every classical political economists believe that there was a declining tendency in the rate of profit in market systems and they thought one of their jobs was to account for it. They thought it was definitely the case that there is this phenomenon and you had to explain why it occurs.

Speaker 1:          07:53          It's in fact, if we look over the long course of capitalism since the 19th century, it's far from clear that there is as an empirical matter, a longterm declining tendency in the rate of profit. Um, in Marx's case, uh, as you know, his story about the declining tendency and the rate of profit had to do with the increasing capital intensity of production that, um, as capitalists compete by, uh, relying more and more on what he calls constant capital. Um, there's less and less fresh value created. And so what capitalists entrepreneurs do at the margin to be more competitive in the long run to more profitable in the medium run, makes them less profitable. So the capitalists who puts the Spinning Jenny and increases his profits in the short run, but when they're spinning jennies in every cotton factory in the economy, the rate of profit is lower than before the first spinning Jenny had been put in. And Mark's identified that as the basic dynamic driving the declining tendency in the rate of profit. Two problems with it.

Speaker 2:          09:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:08          One is

Speaker 1:          09:11          that it is, so there's a sort of finite number of industries because you could say, you could grant his argument and say, yeah, it's, it's true that the rate of profit in the cotton industry will fall as it becomes more and more capital intensive. But there are all kinds of new industries that are going to come into being all the time. So capital will flow eventually into other industries and they'll start out with big profit margins and then the profit margins will get competed away. But then capital level goes somewhere else. So unless you have this idea that this is sort of fixed number of lines of production such that that once profit start to fall in all of them, I'm not going gonna fall economy. Why there's no particular reason, even working from Marx's on premises to think that has come up with any lasting account of why the rate of profit would fall in capitalist systems. Moreover, even putting that problem to one side, if you think about it, if it is the case,

Speaker 2:          10:21          okay,

Speaker 1:          10:21          even if it is the case that making capital, uh, pro production more capital intensive reduces profit margins in the long run. Nonetheless, if productivity goes up at a more rapid rate than capital displaces labor in the production process, then you wouldn't necessarily see the right of profit fall. So if, if the rate of increase in productivity exceeds the rate at which capital is displacing label, put it in Marx's jargon, constant capitalist, displacing variable capital, then there's actually no reason to expect, um, the rate of profit to fall. So it all depends on how much more productive capitol makes Labor. And there's no theoretical answer to that question. It's an empirical question. So, even though I'm Marx thought there was a declining tendency in the rate of profit, it's debatable whether in fact there is, and it's certainly not the case that his theory explained why it should occur.

Speaker 2:          11:33          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:34          His third argument, competition, LM and eight competitors. And because production is becoming more and more capital intensive, entry costs are going up and you're not going to see new people coming into the market.

Speaker 2:          11:50          Okay?

Speaker 1:          11:51          I told the story about, uh, NASA and the o rings on the challenge of blowing up. There was nobody to come into the market and, uh, uh, take over dad's. So you have a monopoly, not very efficient monopoly producer, um, uh, who lacks the incentive to innovate and we have the sorts of problems we saw that developed with Morton Thiokol in that instance. So that's also true, only under a fairly restrictive set of assumptions, which might not turn out to be true after all. There are some industries in which there are economies of smallness. Think about apple computers invented in somebody's garage in California, um, you know, completely upending IBM and the big established capital-intensive computer firms. Uh, and totally transforming that market. So it's not necessarily true. You know, Mark's had in his mind, 19th century industrial production, uh, you know, steelworks cotton factories, this sort of thing.

Speaker 1:          13:09          But it's a very historically bounded perception of what it is that goes on in, in, in economic systems. And there might be all sorts of sectors in the economy that tend to resist the development of monopolies and in which there are various economies of smallness that actually lend themselves to the constant entry of new players, uh, that he provided. Realizing the system. And I think the, the, the information technology revolution that, uh, of that is accompanied your generation would be exhibit a in, uh, defending that proposition under consumption or sometimes it's said overproduction obviously means the same thing. You know, the way we put it into Marx's sort of conceptual scheme was the argument that the workers collectively couldn't buy everything they produced. A Smith believed that Ricardo believed that. Marx believed that an early theories of imperialism, we're partly, uh, dreamed up in order to explain that, that, that you get, you get imperialism partly as a result of the search for new markets to address the endemic weak demand in capitalist systems. Marks is not the only person who thought there was endemic weak demand in capitalist systems. Indeed, uh, canes, the, the Great English economist of the first half of the 20th century. And, and the, the theorist who's, whose ideas informed,

Speaker 1:          14:52          uh, the policies to end the depression also thought there was endemic weak demand in capitalist systems because of a diminishing marginal propensity to consume. Keynes's idea wise, if you have no money and I give you a dollar, you'll spend it. But if you have $1 million and I give you a dollar, you'll save it. And so when you get into recessions, the problem is weak demand. And so you get the Keynesian answer to a recession. So depressions is to spend money at the bottom with governments to do that largely through borrowing. And this is of course, what a first, the George W. Bush administration in its final year. And then the Obama administration in its first year have been doing a classic Keynesian response to their risks. The what's now being called the great recession to prevent it from becoming a great depression, namely the state borrows money, tries to spend it in, in the parts of the economy that will stimulate demand and then we'll get the economy going back up. So again, this is an example of marches, chronic underestimation of the capacity of the state to do things that will stave off crises or manage crises or prevent them from becoming catastrophic, really bad. And so, uh, you know, I think we've seen a vivid illustration of that in the last couple of years.

Speaker 1:          16:33          Finally, working class consciousness as all of these other things were going on and making the system, you know, creek at the joints and become less and less functional. Marx thought that, um, the workers would start to become a class for itself. The workers would start to see that they were getting ripped off and, uh, get angry about it, become mobilized. And militant and reached the point where they believe that they had nothing to lose, but they're chains.

Speaker 1:          17:10          Now there are two problems with that. One, we already mentioned, uh, on Monday or last Wednesday, this is that Mark's was half right in thinking that people judge their utility by what others get. They don't just ask the Reagan question, am I better off than I was four years ago? They do pay attention to what others get, but they generally, and this is the part where he was wrong. I know a hundred years of industrial sociology has now pretty much established desk. They tend to compare themselves to similarly situated people. So workers in the auto industry compare themselves to steelworkers or coworkers, not, um, to the executives who run the firms in which they actually work. And that's true up and down the occupational scale. I think I mentioned, uh, a professor will be much more upset to learn that their salary is $5,000 less than the professor in the next office.

Speaker 1:          18:15          Then they will be to learn that their salary is $500,000 less than the attorney who lives down the street. People compare themselves to others, but to similarly situated others not to people very far from them in the socioeconomic order. And so that kind of militancy doesn't eventuate. More importantly, Mark's actually conflates the relative immiseration of the proletariat with the absolute immiseration of the proletariat. See if we went back through the slides and we, we went back to the discussion of the theory of exploitation. Remember when, when we, we did that little exercise and we, we saw that you would all actually agree to be more exploited on his definition than less exploited. Um, when you had the choice of either going to a 10 hours working day, um, with new technology or an 11 hours working day without it. Um, but that measure was a relative measure.

Speaker 1:          19:22          It was what you get as a proportion of the total surplus as compared with what the capitalist gets. It wasn't an absolute measure and we saw that it's perfectly possible for the rate of exploitation as he defines it to go up. While the level of wages remains constant or even increases. So wages might be going up as well as exploitation at the same time. Well, but if that's true, you never going to reach absolute immiseration. You're never going to actually reach the point where we're workers are literally falling into poverty. And if it's the absolute immiseration that has to trigger the militant action, they're working class consciousness, it's not going to happen. And indeed, here again, Mark's greatly underestimated what governments can do to make sure that the workers don't reach the point where they have nothing to lose. But their chains. In the 1950s a Marxian in English marks in political economists called Ralph Miliband, who son now is a British cabinet member, by the way. Um, David Miliband and this is the likely next leader of the Labour party after they lose the elections in May to a David Cameron, uh, David Miller band's father Ralph wrote a book called the state in Capitalist Society in the 1950s, I think it was 1954 but don't hold me to it in which he said, the welfare state is capitalism's best friend.

Speaker 3:          21:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:09          You know, the right always attacks the welfare state, but it's capitalism's best friend because it buys off working plus discontent. And it ensures that workers have a stake in the existing order and that they will never reach this proverbial situation where they have nothing to lose, but they're chains. So when you, you work your way through this macro theory, it's riddled with holes and doesn't add up to the collapse of capitalism. And it not therefore particularly surprising that a capitalism didn't collapse in the ways that Mark's predicted. But now let's dig in a little bit more to the micro theory and the micro foundations of Marxists thinking because I think this is where, um, we will find, uh, some interesting lessons for our own project in this course going forward. At the heart of the micro theory is the labor theory of value. And we're going to say something about three aspects of it. We're going to talk about, um, Mark's assumptions about living human labor, the moral argument behind the Labor theory of value, which many people you will find in this room, find the POA despite the problems with the labor theory of value and then some alternative formulations of what it is that he was trying to do.

Speaker 1:          22:54          If, if you think back to when we were doing the exposition of the Labor theory of value, I said that Mark's defends it living human labor power as a source of value by saying it's the only thing

Speaker 3:          23:10          that

Speaker 1:          23:12          goes into the production. It's the only thing that creates fresh surplus value. Okay. So one difficulty is, and John Roma points this out in that piece that I had you read, it ignores the contribution of dead workers that living workers, uh, for instance, we, when we talked about the introduction of machinery, the Spinning Jenny or whatever, what about the workers who made the spinning? Jenny, are they part of this calculation? Are they being either by the capitalist or by the living workers who use the Spinning Jenny? So if you took it seriously, you'd have to say those exploitation indexes is way too simple because they don't capture the contribution of dead workers. But then a second thing, it doesn't capture the Labor theory of value as soon as the capitalists can contributes

Speaker 3:          24:13          what? Nothing.

Speaker 1:          24:16          But why isn't it the case that what the, the, the, the Labor that the capitalists performs also goes in to the creation of the surplus. And again, I think you've got to imagine, get yourself back into this 19th century mindset. Her intellectual work doesn't seem petty particularly important. Um, you know, you're just running these big factories. But of course, you know, when we think about what the, the, the, the role of entrepreneurial ideas is in the creation of productive systems. It's absurd to say that the work of the capitalist doesn't contribute anything to the value of what's produced. But then you get into the problem of, well, how do you discover what is, what is the result of the work of the worker and what is the result of the work of the cap and list? And there's no mechanism for dealing with that.

Speaker 3:          25:23          And then

Speaker 1:          25:25          what about the fact that the worker in March, this typical model has a spouse at home feeding him, uh, you know, uh, sending him, making his sandwiches as he goes to the factory and so on and so forth. What about the spouse at home? Why is it just the worker who's being exploited?

Speaker 3:          25:52          And

Speaker 1:          25:53          various theorists have said, you know, if you take Marxism seriously on its own premises, it seems that, again, just as with the dead worker, the stay at home spouse is either being exploited indirectly by the capitalist or is being exploited by the worker who goes to work. She is doing unpaid labor. And so we've had a series of feminist critiques of the Labor theory of value

Speaker 3:          26:22          and

Speaker 1:          26:24          this gets recognized in daily life. Uh, this, uh, very interesting, 1986 divorce case in the state of New York in which, uh, a couple had gotten married. He had gone to medical school, she had stayed at and darn does socks and made sandwiches for him and helped him through medical school. Anyway, many years later they get divorced. And apart from the usual issues in the divorce of, um, the courts said that the stay at home wife had a property interest in her husband's medical practice.

Speaker 1:          27:08          That was a byproduct of the work that she had put into it by darning socks and making the sandwiches. And he went to class and built up his practice. And so they awarded her 40% property interest in the practice and required him to maintain life insurance in her name for the rest of his life so that her property interest could be protected. So what you can see once you start to do this, you know, I've just given three areas where this runs into trouble. Once you take seriously the idea that Labor is the source or labor power, the capacity to work is the source of value. Why zero in men in this, you know, motto and I Echo y on what one worker dies and the who in the production process. What about all of the others who contribute to PR to the productivity of the process? Either directly as with the capitalists will indirectly. And of course, once you make this point about the stay at home spouse, you know, what about the Sunday school teacher that drum the work ethic into the worker. Um, didn't that Sunday school teacher contribute something to the productivity of the worker and so on. So you're going to get, you know, this huge web of indecipherable entangled, um, entitlements. Um, if you're trying to trace out who contributed what work to the creation of something of value,

Speaker 2:          28:43          okay,

Speaker 1:          28:43          more fundamentally, let's dig into the assumption that making creates entitlements after all. For Marx, it's the, it's this is what seems to give the theory. It's it's ideological edge. Uh, as I said, it's a secular version of locks. Workmanship. It's the claim that work has produced something for which they're are not compensated. They produce something and the capitalist takes it, right. That's the, that's the claim.

Speaker 2:          29:19          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:21          And when we were doing the exposition of that, I said that what differentiates labor power from all other commodities is that it's necessary for the production of every commodity. It's the common denominator of all commodities. Man, by gave you the example, I said if I, um, if I have a certain amount of money and I spend it on a meal, I consume the meal and it's gone. Whereas if I spend it paying somebody to paint my house at the end of having consumed their labor power, I have a more valuable house. If I go to sell the house, I'm going to get more from it than I would have gotten. But for having, uh, not ha not having had it painted. And so that's the idea that the consumption of living human labor power leads the fresh ration of fresh exchange value. Whereas media consumption of a meal doesn't.

Speaker 2:          30:25          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          30:26          terrible argument. What's wrong with it? Nobody can see what's wrong with it. Come on. It's terrible argument. Hopelessly bad argument. Anybody. Yes ma'am.

Speaker 4:          30:58          Um, could the meals value be that it keeps you alive? Say, say a little more. You're dead right. Um, so the meal, even though it's, you can only use it once, um, it is necessary for this sustained value of like yourself.

Speaker 1:          31:12          Okay. And, and what, but just take, take that thought a little further. Where does it go? Yeah, you're dead right.

Speaker 4:          31:18          Um, so the valued is like constant,

Speaker 1:          31:26          well, not exactly, but the point, is it just wrong? Just say it and I can consume that food. It goes because after all, I have more calories of energy, which I could then use to pay my own house with. Right? Let's say, of course I might sit on the couch and watch the Superbowl and just get fat, but that's my own decision, right? I can use that energy, right. To paint the house and saw a very interesting, um, Cambridge economist called Pierre Ross Rafa wrote a book called the production of commodities by means of commodities in the, uh, it's, it's even though it's a s it's about an 80 page book. It took him 30 pages to 30 years to write. Um, and that's a whole different story, which I have time to go into. But he, this is what he, this is what he said, that's of interest to us. He said, imagine an economy that has three commodities, corn, books, food. I'm sorry, corn books. Labor. Corn is food, corn books and Viber. Yes. It's true that it takes labor to produce corn and to produce box. Yes, it's true that it does not take books to produce corn or labor, but it's not true

Speaker 1:          32:50          that it doesn't require corn to produce labor and books,

Speaker 1:          32:55          so corn or food or anything that's necessary for the production of labor power is going to have the same property that labor power has. Its going to be present ness necessarily directly or indirectly in all lines of production and strokes. Rafa said based on that idea you can, you couldn't do a corn theory of value for this economy that will have exactly the same mathematical properties. It's the labor theory of value and then you can do the tea. You can have your theory of the exploitation of corn by capitol, the rate of exploitation of corn by capital. That will be exactly analogous to the rate of the exploitation of Labor by Capitol. There is no difference, mathematically identical. Why is that interesting to us? It's interesting to us because it shows you that whatever mark says about exploitation merely being a technical notion, it's not, it's a moral idea. We don't care. You know, we do. We even colloquially, we talk about the exploitation of natural resources, but we don't care. We don't say that the corn owns what was produced with the corn. We don't sell, we don't say the corn was exploited in the way that worker was exploited. We just don't

Speaker 1:          34:27          think about an intermediate case.

Speaker 3:          34:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          34:31          A horse down a mine shaft in a coal mine hauling trucks have called from the face to the, to the, um, elevator that's going to take it out. You know, we could do the whole, he, the story, we could say the, the, the horse covers the cost of its feed in the first hour of the day. Uh, and it works 10 hour days. So the other nine hours it's producing surplus that accrues to somebody other than the horse. It's the horse exploited.

Speaker 3:          35:11          Yes. No,

Speaker 1:          35:16          nobody thinks that. Nobody thinks of the horse. Is it an exploited,

Speaker 3:          35:20          some

Speaker 1:          35:22          much trickier case. Right. And the reason it's tricky is some people are much more open to the idea of animal rights than others, right? So, you know, for block, Trina said animals where there, what waste of God put there for I use, but we're not that hard hearted. Some of us. So if you think of of the horses in some sense a kind of moral agent, then it's, it's not a happy thing that it's being, it's being exploited in the sense, but whether or not we want to say the exploitation is on just not just, just cruel if the horse is suffering. But I'd just depends upon some prior idea that people are, or creatures are entitled to the product of their labor.

Speaker 2:          36:19          Okay.

Speaker 1:          36:19          That's the workmanship idea. And that is why even if you reject the labor theory of value, you're still left with this, this nagging idea that there's something to workmanship. Most people are not gonna want to totally get rid of workmanship. You know, if I write a book, I think I put all that blood, sweat and tears into that book. It's mine. It's mine. My work. Somebody takes that. You've stolen something that I made. It's a very powerful thing in people, but not everybody accepts it, right? Not Everybody accepts this idea, this very individualistic sense centric conception that we own. What we make. We have this kind of exclusive, uh, to go back to the language of lock in the first treaties that week. We are, God made us with the capacity to be miniature gods, to have the same ownership rights of a what we make as he has over his creation. Look at chief Seattle. He has a very different view. This, we know the earth does not belong to man. Man belongs to the earth.

Speaker 1:          37:53          All things are connected like the blood that unites us all. Man did not weave the web of life. He is married a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself. Very different view of the world and our place in it, right? Not Man centric. And when we, when we, one of the reasons we started this course with lock, it's this is where the individualism comes from. It's this workmanship ideal. Doesn't lucky individualist at all in locks formulation because at the end of the day, it's a theological argument. It's an argument about lock, uh, about God having owner make has rights over his whole creation. But it's the move of saying we are miniature gods that can behave in a godly fashion and then secularizing it, which, which leads to the individualism or consider something that Robert Nozick, uh, a writer we're going to read later in the class pretty soon actually starting next week. He makes fun of the Labor theory of value. He says, why does mixing once Labor with something make one the owner of it.

Speaker 2:          39:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:11          Behalfs paps because one owns one's labor, self ownership if you lie. And so one comes to own a previously unknown thing that becomes permeated with what one on ownership seeps over into the rest. But why isn't it, why isn't mixing what I own with what? I don't own a way of losing what I own rather than of gaining what I don't know if I own a can of tomato juice and spell it into the sea so that its molecules made re radioactive. So I can check this mingle evenly throughout the sea. Do I thereby come to own the sea or have I foolishly dissipated my tomato juice?

Speaker 2:          39:59          Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:59          Why is it that we want to say, when I made, I put effort and energy into something that it's mine. Very, very perplexing and tricky thing. And we will come back to it, uh, in, in considerably more detail later in the course when we read John Rawls because interestingly, it's not until we get to John Rawls that we find anyone who's really willing to radically question workmanship and the self ownership postulate that goes with it. Okay. So mark says, I'm seems problematic. So what's left, and I think there are really two main things left. One is a negative argument that comes out of Marxism rather than any of its positive, uh, claims. And that is the fact that his theory of exploitation fails doesn't mean that he lacks a good critique of markets as distributors, uh, either goods or harms in society. You know, we could go back to our story about Trump and the bag lady, for example. Um, the Paredo superior result in that example of you remember wished for the bag lady to die because there was no righto x superior exchange that could occur between Trump and the bag laggy markets.

Speaker 2:          41:42          Okay,

Speaker 1:          41:43          reflect the inequalities that come in to them,

Speaker 1:          41:47          but they don't give any account of the justice of those inequalities. So as there's this problem, if you like, of the tyranny of the status quo. And we saw that in the economic realm with the analysis of that problem and in the political realm when we talked about the the corn dealer problem with Mel, right? That the market systems of bias towards the status quo, but market principles are purely procedural principles. They tell you nothing about how you got the status quo. And so there's a kind of garbage in garbage out problem with market systems. Nozick we will say makes this point explicit when he says any remotely plausible theory of justice is going to have to have three parts. A theory of justice in acquisition, a. I. E. A theory of starting points, a theory of justice in transfer I a theory of exchanges and the theory of the rectification of past injustice.

Speaker 1:          42:46          I E F theory for dressing, um, accumulated injustices of the par paused and Nozick well for reasons which we will go into. Thanks. He has accounts of all of those things, but it's an the negative crap. Um, the negative argument of Marxism that markets are not justified by reference to the failure of marks or so an alternative theory is good. If you're going to have a justification for the distribution that occurs through markets, it's gonna have to be something else. It's gonna have to be provided. Maybe it can be provided. But so far in the utilitarian and neo classical traditions, it hasn't been provided. So there's a kind of unfinished agenda there that's put on the table by the, the Marxian Critique of markets. Um, even though his answer to that, his marks, his answer to that problem is, uh, I'm convincing. And then I think secondly,

Speaker 1:          43:56          what Marx is, I'm leaves us to address is not an argument about the sources of value. The labor theory of value is just a hopeless analytical mass and uh, can't be resuscitated. There's no way to fix the labor theory of value. Um, but there is an argument about freedom. Remember where we started? I said, unlike the conventional wisdom that Marx is an egalitarian, no, he's a theorist of freedom. His Utopian ideal, a world in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all where our neighbor is not an alienated. We saw that the Utopian version of that is unsustainable. Nonetheless. Mark says definition of class. When you think about it, it's really an argument about freedom.

Speaker 3:          44:55          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          44:56          When do you say she, you're working class. If you have to sell your labor power to somebody else in order to live, it's the compulsion,

Speaker 3:          45:05          right?

Speaker 1:          45:06          It's a compulsion. It's not why that you choose to, you know, I liked lecturing here. Having a captive audience of people have to listen to me ramble on and dusty makes me feel good, but that's not what makes me working class.

Speaker 3:          45:20          Right?

Speaker 1:          45:21          It's that, that I have to work for somebody else in order to survive. It's that element of compulsion. That's your lack of freedom. And that is the so, so as, AS Roma puts it in the essay that I put on the syllabus, it's that some, there's a class monopoly of the means of production which creates that power that some people have the power to insist that other people work for them. So it's really not about the calculus of contributions and who, what's what and you know, whether the rate of exploitation 2.33 or 1.6 or anything, it's not about that. It's really about the distribution of power in the production process. And if we're going to take anything from marks that is of enduring value, it's going to be an argument about power. It's going to be an argument which says that a world in which we organize things so that one class effectively has power to control a different classes, behavior that is an unjust world, and much of the Neo Marxist literature that, um,

Speaker 3:          46:35          okay.

Speaker 1:          46:35          People take seriously jettisons the labor theory of value and explores this power based argument as the root of what it was Mark's was trying to get at with the concept of exploitation. See you on Monday.
