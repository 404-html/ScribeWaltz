Speaker 1:          00:01          So today we're going to start talking about classical utilitarianism and we're going to use as our, as our point of departure, Jeremy Bentham, uh, who lived between 1748 and 1832 and came up with the canonical statement of the doctrine of utilitarianism. It's a doc train, which is still very much alive and kicking and the contemporary west despite all of its problems. And we'll have things to say about why that is. But I wanted to make a couple of prefatory remarks first about Bentham himself that there is some think is in, in a western tradition, I guess in any tradition who have a particular characteristic that um, Bentham certainly has. And I think of the folks we're going to read, Karl Marx had and Robert Nozick had. And the, the thing I'm thinking of here is they are the kind of person who takes one idea to the most extreme possible formulation.

Speaker 1:          01:14          They asked themselves the question, how would the world be if this idea that I have is that is the only important idea? And they take it to its logical extreme to an excessive kind of formulation. And they will go places with their idea that nobody else will go. Um, and so that makes them a little bit crazy. Um, you know, their motto I call obsessive leak, uh, consumed with their idea. In the case of Bentham, it's the idea of utility, which we're going to unpack a little bit, uh, in the moment. Um, but what's always interesting about people like this is that they play out an idea to its logical extreme and that exhibits both its strengths and its limitations because it's just because they're willing to go when others will not go think the unthinkable, think politically very incorrect things for their time in pursuit of, of really pushing this idea to the absolute health.

Speaker 1:          02:26          And so Bentham is a kind of thinker who, um, I suspect at the end of the day, nobody will be fully convinced by, but he's very useful. He's a very useful, um, diagnostician of what, what it is about utilitarianism that's going to be appealing to you and where eventually you're going to want to put some limits on it just because he goes beyond the limits. And so you can see what happens. Um, if you push it all the way to the hilt. Secondly, I wanted to just say that Bentham is important, um, as a, as a fountain of more than Utilitarian Nissam but also of modern conceptions of value more generally considered. Um, you'll see that he is one of the, there were the, there were rumblings of the kinds of things he had to say about value in the 17th century. Hobbes for example, who I mentioned last time criticized Aristotle for not seeing that what is good for some people may not be good for other people.

Speaker 1:          03:36          Um, and Bentham builds on that idea. Uh, you'll see Bentham, we'll start to link the good to what it is that people desire. Um, it, there were also rumblings of Bentham's methods in, in particularly his aspirations to found politics on scientific principles in the 17th century. We already saw last time the hubs, Yana and Lockian creationist theories of science, but they were really transitional figures. They also gave a theological justifications for their arguments. As I explained at some length in lock, uh, in the context of lock. I didn't have time to do it with Hobbs, but many of you will know that if you read the the second two thirds of Hobbs' Leviathan, it's almost all about interpretation of the scriptures showing that uh, his scientifically derived principles are also consistent with the Bible. Bentham sheds all of this for Bentham. Um, he's not interested in appeals to tradition.

Speaker 1:          04:48          He's not interested in appeals to religion. He's not interested in appeals to natural law. He dismisses the natural law tradition as dangerous nonsense nonsense on stilts. He's only interested in a scientific set of principles for organizing politics. And one of the nice things about Bentham, at least from your point of view is um, and we'll see that utilitarianism values efficiency in in many ways. But one of the interesting things or the helpful things about Bell Bentham is that he reduces his whole doctrine to a single paragraph and he puts that paragraph right at the front of his introduction to the principles of morals and legislation. So yeah, you have the kind of cliff notes formulation of Bentham's argument. He says that nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do as well as to determine what we shall do.

Speaker 1:          06:03          So this is going to be about describing human behavior and about what ought to be the case, right? What we shall do to determine what we ought to do is to point out why we ought to do as well as to determine what we shall do. On the one hand, the standard of right and wrong on the other, that chain of causes and effects are fastened to their throne. That's the throne of pain and pleasure. They govern us in all we do and all we say, and in all we think every effort we can make to throw off our subjection. That's how subjection to pleasure seeking and pain avoiding will serve, but to demonstrate and confirm it, to confirm that objection in words, a man may pretend to have juror their empire. That's the empire of pain and pleasure, but in reality, he will remain subject to it. All the while. The principle of utility recognizes this subjection and assumes it for the foundation of that system, the object of which is to repair the fabric of Felicity by the hands of reason and law system, which it systems which attempt to question it deal in sounds instead of senses in caprice instead of reason and in darkness instead of light. That is in a Nacelle Bentham's theory.

Speaker 2:          07:35          Okay,

Speaker 1:          07:37          very bold, unequivocal statement. He's saying if you want to understand human beings in a causal explanatory sense, all you have to know about them is that they're going to seek pleasure and avoid pain. And if you want to think about what ought to happen in the design of institutions they need, they should be designed around that fact to accommodate that fact. And he is going to develop a system of laws, a system of government, uh, that that takes into account in his belt upon this assumption about human nature as he would have called it human psychology, as we would call it today. Now I'm going to make five points about Bentham system to give you some sense of the full dimensions of it. Before we start this disecting it and subjecting it to critical scrutiny. Want to make sure that we understand exactly what his system is. I want to first of all notice that it is what I'm going to call a comprehensive and account. I call it a comprehensive and deterministic account in that it's an account of all human behavior. He wants to say everything you do is ultimately determined by pleasure seeking and pain, avoiding

Speaker 1:          09:17          how plausible. Who thinks that's plausible? Hands up plausible implausible. Okay. Give us an example. Somebody of something that is not pleasure seeking or pain, avoiding anybody. Something that is not the result of pleasure seeking pain. Avoiding while you put your hands up, you must've had some thoughts. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. You, yeah. You take the fire to rescue people. Pardon? Running into a fire to rescue people running into a fire to rescue people. Okay. You run into a fire to rescue people. What do you think Bentham would say about that example? Yeah. Over here, sir,

Speaker 3:          10:12          the pleasure is actually saving the people, so there is like this benefit that you get from it.

Speaker 1:          10:17          Pleasure you get from having saved, the people must outweigh the pain of the file or you wouldn't do it. Any other example? Nobody's got an exam son. Nobody can think of an example. No. Yes, yes sir.

Speaker 3:          10:38          Um, will there may be some, for example, saving one's child, maybe purely instinctual rather than driven by pain

Speaker 1:          10:46          or say sacrificing your life to save your child. Let's say they put in an extreme case. Why would rent them say about that? I mean, this seems like a genuinely altruistic, um, action. Somebody lays down their life for their own child. How can that be pleasure seeking and pain avoiding? What would Bentham say? Yeah, that way we need to,

Speaker 3:          11:11          could relieve the pain of having lost a child like outweighs whatever pleasures.

Speaker 1:          11:16          Yeah, I think that is what he would say. Think of the counterfactual. How could I live with myself for the rest of my life? If I didn't do it? The pain would be too great. And Bentham considers cases like that. There's this sort of thing. Apparently altruistic acts, same ultimately always reduceable to the pleasure cane calculus one example. He considers his people acting from religious motivations. And he says, Ha, just read the Bible. You know, look at the descriptions of Heaven and hell. Isn't that a made to order? Pleasure seeking and pain avoidance. Hell is described as, you know, the fires of Hell, perpetual pain. So the people who constructed religious doctrines clearly had an understanding of human nature or they wouldn't have described hell in a way that they described it and heaven in the way that they describe it. So the f, the first thing he wants to say is that this is a completely comprehensive explanation of human behavior.

Speaker 2:          12:28          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:28          Can, can anybody think of any example that couldn't be read described as fitting this pleasure? Pain Calculus. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          12:42          Thinks that if life is all about pain and pleasure and we will be willing to replace our load with one with own, I'm in one only with pleasure, right? But we wouldn't, we've all your life by yourself, there's something indescribable quality to it. I mean, love Pfister some of old experiences rather than just playing pain and pleasure, sir.

Speaker 1:          13:00          So you think that there is more complexity to human motivation? Um, that's just not expressible as a reduceable to pain and pleasure. I think, you know, that was a, that's a very sophisticated and common critique that's been made of Bentham. If you go and read and indeed if you read the obituary of him that was written, um,

Speaker 2:          13:28          okay.

Speaker 1:          13:28          By Coleridge, I think it was, it makes exactly this point that there was this sophistication to human motivation that isn't captured in this idea. I think that the truth has, Bentham would have acknowledged some of that, but he would have said, you know, at the end of the day it's unimportant because the pleasure, pain calculus overrides when the chips are down. If we're going to think about what it is that's going to motivate people, it's, it's, um, pleasure seeking and pain avoidance. Okay. A second thing that you should notice about this doctrine is that, I'm going to call it a naturalistic doctrine in some ways. It's astounding that writing almost half a century before Darwin, Darwin was born in 1809 and lift till 1882, so writing almost half a century before Darwin. Um, Bentham grounds his principle in the apparent, in the imperatives for human survival.

Speaker 2:          14:33          Okay.

Speaker 1:          14:33          He thinks that the pleasure pain principle has a natural biological basis, although there are religious, moral and political sources and sanctions of pain and pleasure. These are all secondary to the physical sources for Bentham. The physical, he refers at one point as the groundwork of the political, moral and religious. It is included in each of them.

Speaker 1:          14:58          At another point he says, we are bound by the principle of utility as, uh, the natural constitution of the human frame. Often, unconsciously and office when often went out, conscious explanations for our actions are inconsistent with the principle of utility. I'll come back to that point. If we didn't abide by the principle of utility, he says in his little essay on the economic psychology of man, he says, quote, the human species could not continue in existence and that in a few months, not to say week, so days we would would be all that would be needed for its annihilation. In other words, the principle of utility expresses our objective interests as living creatures.

Speaker 2:          15:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:49          A third point that I'm going to make about Bentham's doctrine is that it's what I will call egoistic, but not subjectivist. Now that's a lot of babble terminology and let me explain what it means. The reason I'm using those two words together is that they don't normally go together. That is to say egoistic views are usually subjectivists. So I'm, I'm pointing out that they're not. And by Egoistic, I mean it is, uh, just like in wall economics assumptions, assumption of self interest, people are self interested, seek as off to pleasure and self interested. Avoid is a pain in exactly the way you learn about them in an economics 101 a textbook. Um, and we'll, we'll have occasion to examine that self interested premise, uh, in some depth later, but it's not a subjectivist doctrine in that Bentham wants to say this is true. Regardless of what we ourselves say about our preferences, it's not dependent upon a, your acknowledging it's truth for it's being true. Okay. So you might think you're motivated by altruism or love of your child or your religious faith. Bentham says you're just muddled and diluted. You don't understand, uh, your subjective understanding is not in accord with the science of the matter. Um,

Speaker 1:          17:34          at one of, at one point he says it is with the anatomy of the human mind as it is with the anatomy and physiology of the human body. The rare case is not of a man's being unconverted hunt but of his being conversant with it. So just as you know, if you have a pain in your side and you don't know if it's your liver or your spleen or your long, uh, you know, the rare case as you get it right, um, he wants to do is exactly the same with your motivation. The fact that you don't understand or wouldn't agree with or don't acknowledge what's motivating you so much the worst for you. You just have an inaccurate or incomplete understanding of your motivation. You just wrong. Okay. So it's in that sense picks up on the idea. This is an objectivist account. People are, it's, it is objectively the case. Whatever people think about it, whatever people say about it, it is objective may be the case that they behave self interest. The Lea and the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. Fourth Bentham's is a radically consequentialist doctrine. Anyone know what that might mean?

Speaker 1:          18:59          Anyone want to tell us what is our, what do you think I might mean by calling it a consequentialist doctrine? Yeah. Yes ma'am.

Speaker 5:          19:20          Um, that in being motivated by pleasure and pain were concerned with the consequences of our actions. If we know something's going to be painful, we'll avoid it. And if it's going to be pleasurable, will move towards it.

Speaker 1:          19:34          Yeah. But as I said at the beginning of the electric, Bentham takes everything to the extreme. So if we are concerned with the consequences of our, of the action and nothing else, it's an extreme consequentialist doctorate. He's not interested in our intentions, right? The road to hell is paved with good intentions for Bentham. No, doesn't matter what people intend. It matters what happens, right? It's a radically consequentialist doctrine. We will see that there's an alternative tradition of thinking about ethics and politics that is deeply rooted in human intentions. When we come to, um, to read Robert Nozick and John Rawls and people who draw on cons. Emmanuel [inaudible] ethics. But, and that's what gets to you to give you all of the, the jargon a upfront that is what will be called de ontological. Um, sometimes contrast that with teleological consequentialist is a kind of teleological doctrine. What is teleological main? Anybody?

Speaker 2:          20:53          Yeah, at the back

Speaker 1:          20:58          teleological system.

Speaker 6:          21:07          Well, given that a telos in Greek is the end, the end,

Speaker 1:          21:13          that's purpose. The consequence. Exactly right. So consequential as doctrines I like are teleological doctrines. They're all about the consequences, the purpose, the end, the goals, the results. Whereas what we will talk about later when we get to day ontological systems are the antithesis of that. They are focus on intentions, on processes, on procedures, on high, on how you do things, not on where you get to. Okay. So Bentham is a radical consequentialist and you judge a doctrine simply by looking you judge a, a possible policy and action. Anything you thinking of doing or not doing simply by virtue of what effect that is likely to have and nothing else, nothing else matters.

Speaker 2:          22:07          Finally,

Speaker 1:          22:10          Bentham. Thanks everything he's doing this quantifiable.

Speaker 2:          22:15          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          22:15          no, I gave you just a sliver to read from his introduction to the principles of morals and legislation, just so that you could get a sense of how this guy's mind actually work. He really thought it was the case that he could develop a kind of science of utilitarianism where he would figure out exactly how many you tells you. We might call them, we might call them standard international utiles. The Siu would attached to a of pleasure or pain, any policy or action, and that eventually you could figure out exactly what all of the optimal policies were for the Organization of society. He thought about utility. He thought it had really four dimensions. How intense is it? Duration, how long does it last? It's certainty or uncertainty. That is probability that the result will occur. And it's what we, what he called propinquity or remoteness, which we would, modern economist would say, we discount pleasure into their future.

Speaker 1:          23:23          Um, so our dollar is more that if you'll say, I'll give you a dollar today or I'll give you a dollar tomorrow, you'll get more utility from the dollar that you get today. Okay. So he, he thought that these were all quantifiable dimensions of utilities, a little unsure about the intensity, um, but he's sure that everything else can be quantified. And he sat about quantifying, uh, he set about trying to figure out a system of legislation, not only for his society, by the way, he started writing constitutions for other countries and when he ran off to Poland and various places and, and said, hey, look, here's my, my utilitarian constitution for your country. And he was very disappointed when people didn't rush off and implemented a right away. So, you know, he, he truly believed that you could come up with a, uh, scientifically demonstrably demonstrable system of organizing society based on the quantify tie ball character of utilitarianism. So one further feature of this quantifiable character of utilitarianism is that he thought we could make comparisons across people. We could do the math across people. We could add up how much utility one person gets from a possible action and how much you tell or the or this utility another person gets and redistribute in order to do what he thought we should do, which was to maximize the greatest happiness of the greatest number.

Speaker 1:          25:22          He's a complete consequentialist. So we would do whatever we have to do to maximize the greatest happiness of the greatest number. So for example,

Speaker 1:          25:35          I happen to know that Denise, who's sitting over there is it has got a great capacity for utility. She's easily pleased. She, uh, you know, if you give her, if you give her a book, she'll be just the lighting. But Antonio over the eyes, kind of grumpy guy, you know, if you give him a book is say, well, why didn't you give me two bucks? You know, one measly buck. You know, so if I have a choice between giving this book to Denise or giving the book to Antony, I'm going to give the book to Denise because she's going to get more utility than Anthony's going to get a, from having this buck. And we don't really care who has the utility from a social perspective, we want a great, maximize the greatest happiness of the greatest number. Okay. But then what we might discover is that layer Neda over there has an even greater capacity for utility. He is just a utility monster. Um, he's got such a capacity for happiness that any little thing that most of us would think, it's neither here nor there. I was really going to make him happy. Well then we should give everything to him, right? So it's, it's, it's a doctrine that's completely uninterested in the distributor side of utilitarianism except in an instrumental way. We'll come back to that on a next Monday, uh, or you want to do is maximize the greatest happiness of the greatest number in society, the total amount of happiness.

Speaker 2:          27:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          27:16          Now here's a further feature of Bentham's doctrine and I think it follows from the consequentialism that you should at least notice, cause I think it will bears on our thinking about, for instance, the Eichmann problem. Um, and this, this is actually taken from Robert Nozick book, who you're going to read later in the semester in his critique of utilitarianism. He says, let's consider the following thought experiment. Suppose, um,

Speaker 1:          27:55          you were cut, your brain was connected to electrodes to buy electrodes to a computer and the computer was programmed to make you have whatever experiences, give you pleasure and not to have any experiences that give you pain. And you were to him. So you would, you would in fact be unconscious. I think actually in nozicks example, floating in a Vat, I'm conscious, but you would believe you were doing whatever it is that gives you the greatest pleasure. And the question now is a cas is, would you want to be connected to the machine? Who would want to be connected to the machine?

Speaker 1:          28:38          Okay. We only have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 15. I see about 15 candidates for Nozick splasher machine who would not want to be connected to this machine. Okay. We Ha we have a probably two thirds of it of you who's not sure. Okay. Some are not sure who, those who wouldn't want to be connected. Why not? I mean, this is great, isn't it? You have to work anymore. You don't have to do assignments. You don't have to show up to class. You just, you know, for the rest of your life. Maybe your program too, to have the experiences that give you the most pleasure in life. What could be better than that? Why don't you want to do it? Yeah. Over here.

Speaker 2:          29:25          Yeah.

Speaker 7:          29:30          I think the point of life is to have like a complexity of experiences and without experiencing pain at some point, pleasure wouldn't be a sweet.

Speaker 1:          29:39          Okay. The point of life is to hold onto the mic. I just want to put the follow this alone, the, the point of life is to have some, some contrast effects. You know, Richard Nixon said, only if you've been in the deepest value, can you appreciate the joy of being on the highest mountain as he was being run out of the White House in 1974. Uh, well you could say, okay, well in that case we'll program the machine accordingly so you'll have, you know, you'll have certain painful experiences in order to maximize the neck of pleasure and pain. So we, you know, uh, you know, every, I don't know, you know, every fifth minute you'll have some unpleasant experience just so that you don't forget how pleasant the pleasant experiences, you know, we can, we can do that.

Speaker 7:          30:29          All right, well then you wouldn't be like having freewill and experiencing the various,

Speaker 1:          30:34          okay, so that's different, right? It's not the contrast. It's, it's not the banality of pleasure. A, if you like, it's, it's that the lack of freewill or autonomy, but coding, we program it to make you thank, you were acting freely even though you weren't, I think. Um, what about that you think, you know, maybe some people say that's true of us all, you know, the parent is this idea we have free, well, it's a lot of bunk were all really basically just acting out certain impulses and instincts. But we believe we have free. Well, so you could be made to believe that you're making choices even if in fact you aren't,

Speaker 7:          31:13          well wouldn't the like free will be as much a component of like the natural physical nature of man? Well now you will his plan. Okay, I'm adding more to,

Speaker 1:          31:24          okay, so that would be a different theory then Bentham's theory, but you can see where you can see where this is going. Right. That I think there were some people in the room, if we, if we had time to pursue this conversation, there are some people in the room who no matter what you did to the programming and the experience machine, they wouldn't like it and they wouldn't like it for two principle reasons. I think one has just been articulated, which is that somehow this seems like an abdication of your own autonomy. Um, and you know, as when you think back to the Eifman problem, one of the things that troubled people was his abdication of his autonomy is given his giving up. If he's free well to say yes or no, I think this is right or wrong. I'm going to do it on the basis of my own autonomous judgment. The second thing I think that people would worry about is who's operating the machine, who's operating a machine is a kind of uh, how do you know that once they've got you floating in that Vat, what you wanted to have done well in fact happen. And so there's a basic problem of um, agency and accountability that makes people nervous. But let's just put those things to one side for the moment and

Speaker 2:          32:54          okay,

Speaker 1:          32:54          focus on the rest of the exposition of Bentham's doctrine. We're going to come back to all of these issues. I promise you, I just want to get them everything out on the table. What he says is that the role of government is

Speaker 1:          33:12          a measure of government. It's a kind of, which is about a particular kind of action performed by a particular person or persons may be said to be comfortable too or dictated by the principle of utility in like Ma when in life man. And the tendency, which it has to augment the happiness of the community is greater than any which it has to diminish it. So again, the bumper sticker version of that for Bentham is maximize the greatest happiness of the greatest number. And for those of you who like thinking diagrammatically and as I noted at the, in my opening lecture, not everybody does, but if we imagine a two person society, so Aa has this much utility, that's the status quo, right? Hey, has this much utility B has that much utility and let's say there's some outer limit of possible utility, which, which we will call the possibility frontier.

Speaker 1:          34:14          Bentham would say any, if you draw that line there, anything that puts us in this Sha, whatever it is, cloudy zone, yeah. Would be a net increase in the total amount of utility in the society. Pretty straight forward plan. Right? So we went from there to that both would have more utility, but if we went from there, say to that, as utility would have gone up and bees would have gone down, but we don't care. Right? Because, um, the total amount of utility in this society has gone up. What we wouldn't want to do is come anywhere into this area because then utility, the total amount of utility in the society would have decreased. Okay? So that's basically the story. Now you might say, well, why do you need government at all?

Speaker 2:          35:19          Okay,

Speaker 1:          35:19          if this is the story, everybody is whatever they think, whatever they say, whatever they understand, everybody is a mindless pleasure seeker and pain avoider or perhaps mindful pleasure, secret pain and avoid it, but they have no control over that. They're going to just do what they have to do. Um, why create a government with the principle that it should maximize utility in the society? It seems like an odd thing to do. Why would you do that? Anyone? Yeah,

Speaker 8:          36:05          so just looking at that last graph, right? If each person tried to maximize their utility, then deed both want to be on the opposite, you know, corners of each other. So then you would get chaos. When you extrapolate that to a larger group, you need something to kind of manage everybody's pleasure.

Speaker 1:          36:22          So people won't voluntarily do things that maximize one another's, maximize the total social utility, right? If taking something from a and giving it to be would increase speeds utility more than it would diminish A's utility, why is not going to go for that voluntarily be, might go and take it. Um, but he may or may not be strong enough to take it. We don't know. So that's a very shrewd observation in response to that diagram. And it's actually gets to more sophisticated questions about redistribution and utilitarianism that I'm going to take up on Monday. But there's, I think before we get to those questions, there's a more fundamental level at which Bentham, thanks. Utilitarianism creates the need for government and that is that there's a disconnect between what's individually optimal and what's socially optimal. Even before we get to the redistributive questions, we might call it the market failure theory of government where,

Speaker 2:          37:42          okay,

Speaker 1:          37:42          other 18th century thinkers had taken the view that when you know Adam Smith's famous invisible hand, everybody acting selfishly leads to a collectively optimal results. Bentham, we'll see. Thanks. That's true a lot of the time, but not always. There are certain circumstances in which,

Speaker 2:          38:07          okay,

Speaker 1:          38:07          people are likely not to act in a way that produces a common result. The great, the great enemy enemies of public piece or the selfish and this social passions necessary as they are. Society has held together only by the sacrifices that men can be induced to May of the gratifications. They demand to obtain these sacrifices is the great difficulty, the great task of government and he's thinking really I've, and it's maybe the first formulation of it that we find what we today call free writing. Free loading.

Speaker 2:          38:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:56          He thinks about the provision of something like national defense, what we call economists call a public good.

Speaker 1:          39:07          You, you can't be excluded from the benefits of it, right? But, and it must be jointly supplied. So it says if for example, the commencement or continuing of a war being the question upon the carpet, if upon his calculation a hundred a year during the continuance of the war or forever will be the amount of the contribution, which according to kiss calculation, he will have to pay. You have to pay $100 a year in taxes to finance this war. If his expected profit by the war will be zero and no particular Gusta passionate into beam to drive him from the pursuit of what appears to be his lasting interest upon the whole, he will be against the war. And what influence it may happen to him to possess will be exerted on the other side. Now why would his benefit be zero?

Speaker 2:          40:02          Okay.

Speaker 1:          40:03          What's, I mean this is rather convoluted prose, but what Bentham saying is if the war's going to be four to anyway,

Speaker 1:          40:13          I get no marginal benefit from supporting it, I might as well oppose it. Well I might as well refuse to pay taxes in supportive. Right, right. And that is the nature of public goods that people can free ride on that provision because an economist says the two features of a public good or they must be jointly surprised. Everybody has to contribute to them. And you can't exclude anybody from the benefits of them like clean areas. We keep clean air for some people, we're going to create clean air for all people. Okay. So people are going to have to be coerced in the provision of public goods. People are going to have to be cohort coerced to pay for the war. So that's one example. Another one that comes up is the so called tragedy of the Commons problem. Suppose you have some common land, and we'll come back to talking about this in connection with walk a social contract theory.

Speaker 1:          41:18          You know, God gave the world to mankind in common on lock story, so long as, as much in as good as available to have this in common. So if, if you have common land, he has the problem. You thinking about grazing with sheep on the, if I put my sheep onto that common land, it doesn't do any lasting damage. But if everybody grazers, they're sheep on the land and and none of it's allowed to lie fallow, then it destroys the common. Okay, so there are too many sheep for everybody to graze the sheep on the land, but any individual person doesn't have a reason not to graze his sheep. This was finally formulated in a rigorous way by a man called Garrett Hardin. The tragedy of the Commons, that if you have Commons, there'll be destroyed because each person will do something that makes individual rational sense but not collective rational sense.

Speaker 1:          42:16          So this is, again, it's not the exactly the same as the free riding problem, but it's related to the free riding problem. I won't see any reason in the world why, um, I shouldn't grace my cow, my sheep on the common. But when everybody does that, we destroy the common, it's a bit like, you know, walking down the street with a soda can and you think, should I take the trouble to cross the street to put it in a recycling bin? Or just throw it in the trash, one coke bottle, you know? I mean, what difference one coke was not going to make it, but if everybody doesn't cross the street, the same problem. Okay. So these are the areas where there's a disconnect. There's a disconnect between individual utility and social utility. And that is what creates the need for government. We will pursue these questions, uh, and my child's about classical utilitarianism next Monday.
