Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. So let's pick up where we left off on Monday and we were starting to talk in more detail about Macintyre's argument. And um, one of the things I want to reserve pro in centrally on today is his account of human psychology or what used to be called human nature. Um, and that differs importantly from every account of human psychology we've looked at thus far, um, for a number of reasons. And I'm going to spell them out in a little bit more detail then we talked about on Monday. Um, basically it is an error, the telian conception of the structure of human psychology and that has a number of features to it. One is that I mentioned to you that we think of human beings as teleological creatures. We are purpose of creatures. We always want to know what the point of an activity is.

Speaker 1:          01:08          Um, now if you go back to Aristotle, Aristotle held the view that while we are purpose of creatures, we only reason about the means to achieve our goals, not the goals themselves. For Aristotle, Aristotles conception of virtue, the virtues, the virtues were given for all time. And he had his list of the virtues, which you can find if you go back and read the Nica McKeon ethics. They're things like a courage, honesty and various other, uh, perhaps debatable, perhaps not. But in any event, in, in Aristotle scheme of things, um, what we reasoned about is the means to achieve the virtues, not the virtues themselves and are going to come back to that because one of the respects in which macintyre differs from Aristotle is that he wants to say, um, the virtues. He wants to at least go this far with the, the enlightenment thinkers. He wants to say that what counts as a virtue is to some extent, uh, up for debate just to what extent and how we debated are things, things that I'll come back to.

Speaker 1:          02:30          But, but the more important point is that this, as, as an account of the structure of human psychology, we need to know what the point is we have, we have goals, we have purposes. When those purposes are met, we're happy and fulfilled when they're not met. We're frustrated and unsatisfied and discontented. Um, just to give you a somewhat different perspective on this, this approach to thinking about human psychology. I would say that the other influential Eris, the Tyrian about time besides Alister Mcintyre is the Nobel prize winning economist Amartya Sen, um, who develops the idea of human potentiality as the core notion that we are, we are people who have potential. And unless we realize our potential, we're going to be in some basic sense in complete. I'm not fulfilled, not happy human beings. And so in incense account of justice, which, uh, I wish we had time to talk about in this course. Uh, but we don't, it's an analogous that he's an economist, not a philosopher. So he's brings the considerations of an economist to this question. But it's the same question of human beings who have a certain kind of potential that has to be realized in order for them to be fulfilled. Uh,

Speaker 2:          04:09          okay.

Speaker 1:          04:09          In the, in the teleological, uh, capacity, it ha that has to occur. And so, um, with Mcintyre too, it's this idea of the structure of human psychology being goal directed. Um, and we'll get, we'll get into the content later. But, so that's the first thing. And then the second was that are um,

Speaker 2:          04:37          yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:38          behavior is in a very fundamental way other directed. So just again by way of a comparison, think back to the

Speaker 2:          04:50          okay.

Speaker 1:          04:50          Assumptions about other directedness in previous thinkers who we have considered in the scores when we focused on the utilitarian tradition, um, we saw a paypal as essentially self referential. Remember Ronald Reagan's famous question in 1984 are you better off than you were four years ago? Was a self referential question. Are you better off than you were four years ago? All you have to look at is how you were fairing four years ago and how you're fairing now. And Ask yourself that question. Other people don't enter into it at all. Then when we considered Marxism, we came to think about other directed conceptions of human psychology in that Mark's made our welfare critically reliant on what others get. Um, and so, um, he said that your perception of whether you're exploited turns upon what your employer gets. I mean, we talked about this in some depth and concluded that Mark's was half right in that people are often other directed in that that sense of, of what they get, their sense of whether what they get is legitimate is dependent on what others get.

Speaker 1:          06:15          But what he was wrong about was that people tend to compare themselves to people who are similarly situated in the socioeconomic order. So auto workers compared themselves maybe to um, uh, steel workers but not to auto executives and they don't make those kinds of global comparisons. Nonetheless, there is something to this idea that people's conception of their welfare is connected to what others get. And so relative inequalities matter simply from the perspective of your feeling of uh, how well off you are. And you can tell yourself any number of stories to make this point. You the, the, the telling why not quite often I think is, you know, you give a child a glass of orange juice that's half full and he's very happy and then you get his sister one that's completely fall and he immediately becomes unhappy because what matters to him is the relative difference and not what he has in his glass.

Speaker 1:          07:25          So that's a notion of other directed. And of course you can take this notion of other directed further still by linking your utility not to just one, just to what other people get, but to actually what other people experience. And this is the concept of other direct, uh, this is the concept of interdependent utility, uh, as it, as it gets referred to in the literature. And the examples here are things like, uh, a parent, um, taking pleasure in their child's success and feeling pain at their child's lack of success. One of the famous a one line has that parents, uh, will resonate with is you can only be as happy as your least happy child. So if your kids are unhappy, then you're miserable. That's the notion of interdependent utility. Your happiness is conditioned on what, on what others get. But Not Justin in making us a relative judgment with the orange juice, Chi kind of a case.

Speaker 1:          08:39          But your happiness becomes dependent on what people are, the actually themselves experience tense, interdependent utility. And those are the example of the child's happiness. Making the parent or the child success, making the parent happy is an interdependent, positive utility. But of course there are interdependent negative utilities as well as when a or a sadist or rapist utility goes up as a byproduct of their victims utility going down. Again, that's interdependent, negative utility. And it's, it's the mirror image of interdependent, positive utility. The Aristotelian conception, that error that Macintyre embraces takes into dependent utilities a step further even than that though in that it's not just that your happiness or success satisfaction or fulfillment is conditioned upon, um, the experience of others, but it's the experience of others as it relates to you. It's the others' experience of you, if you like. And so a good example of this actually comes from Hegel's phenomenology where he talks about, um, the, this dialectic between the master and the slave as being inherently unstable.

Speaker 1:          10:13          Um, but it's not just unstable because the slave is going to find it unsatisfactory. Um, it's, it's, it's unstable because the master will find it unsatisfactory. Hagle says in the phenomenology that what we want most fundamentally is recognition from others, but it can't be recognition from others that we don't respect. So it's the recognition of a slave saying, yes, Monster Know Mazda is not going to be satisfactory or fail failing to you. What you want is recognition from an equal or perhaps a superior, but you want recognition from somebody who's recognition can be valuable to you to source of feeling valued by somebody you value. So it's, it takes this idea, as I said, an interdependent utility, even a step further because it, it's now goes to the, the reciprocal relationship between you and the other person. And that is the idea of practices. That is the, it's a sort of neo regalian idea in, in this particular sense that informs Makin dies.

Speaker 1:          11:34          I notion of a practice. When I gave you the example on Monday, I said, you know, if I build sheds and write books, it's not any, it's not enough for me to have the carpenters say, oh, you wrote a good book. And uh, and the academic side, that's an I shed. I want the carpenter does say that's a good shit. And the people who know about writing books to us to say this is a good book, right? That's the ocean, not the notion of he's a pitcher's pitcher. You want recognition from people for home. You have is steam at the relevant activity. So this is a different, again view of the structure of human psychology. All of these different theories are predicated on some account of the structure of human psychology. And indeed, I think that one thing you should be seeing as we move through and examine these different arguments is that every political theory has an account of human psychology and an account of how the world operates causally.

Speaker 1:          12:46          And you need to sometimes dig to get them out. Um, but, but one of the ways in which you should evaluate them is you should ask yourself, what is the theory of human psychology driving? This doesn't make sense. Is it true to my own experience or not? And if not, why not though? That's one question. And then the second is what are the assumptions about how the world works causally? And I'll come back to those in relation to Mcintyre again, but you could go through all the thinkers we've considered and find assumptions or arguments about those two things. And they provide a very good comparative reference point for thinking about how they stack up against one another. As we've just seen as we went from the utilitarian to the Marxian, uh, to the, uh, different variants of, of other referential, um, human, uh, assumptions about human psychology.

Speaker 1:          13:46          So this is, this is the Mcintyre approach that what we really want out of life is, is steam from people who we esteem and that operates through these, these con, this, these practices as he describes them. And, um, this is just a summary Statement of what I've already told you. He where he says virtues as he describes them are embedded in pro practices. It belongs to the concept of a practice. As I've, as I have outlined it, and as we all familiar with it in our actual lives, whether we are painters or physicists or quarterbacks were indeed just lovers of good painting or first rate experiments or a wealth thrown pass, that it's goods can only be achieved by subordinating ourselves within the practice in our relationships to other practitioners, we have to learn to recognize what is due to whom. We have to be prepared to take whatever self endangering risks or demanded along the way.

Speaker 1:          14:55          And we have to listen carefully to what we are told about our own inadequacies and to reply with the same carefulness for the facts. So this is the notion that I translated into the proposition that when you walk into your first Yell College course, you don't say, look around and say to the people next to you, how should we run this courts? What should we agree to? On the contrary, what you do is say, what is the practice? What are the norms? What are the rules? How do I do well here and what's expected of me? How will I know if I'm doing well? It might occur to you much later on to say, you know, that Washington a very well run a course. It could have been run better if that, if this, that and the other. So you can criticize and Makin I'll come back to that point later.

Speaker 1:          15:50          Um, but you can only criticize on the basis of first having internalized the norms governing the practice, right? You don't criticize somebody's pitching style in major league baseball until you've learned a lot about pitching or maybe you do, you sit there and throw your beer can at the screener or terrible, but, uh, it's not the form of criticism he is going to care about. Right? Uh, and that's the point. And it's not likely to be the criticism that makes any difference. So rather than the, the voluntary agent being at the center of things, which is the, the workmanship story, this anti enlightenment [inaudible] enlightenment story, subordinates the individual to the practice, to the group, to the inherited system of norms and values. And if you want a contemporary reference point, just, just again to sharpen the comparison here compared the car Tz idea, which puts the willing agent at the center of the universe with the um, [inaudible], which is a kind of African religion, which does the contrarian thing instead of I think therefore I am, it's, I am because we are and since we are therefore I am.

Speaker 1:          17:20          So it's this idea of subordinating yourself two and a half and inherited system of norms of prion and practices in which you find yourself not, which you created in he will hypothetically might have created, but where the in which you find yourself. So this is, this is, this is a fundamental difference. It doesn't get more fundamental than this I think. Because as you've seen in every variant of enlightenment thinking it's the will, the willing creative agent that is that the ultimate bottom of the heap. And here it's not. It's the subordinated individual, uh, and the community to which the community or the practice or the tradition to which the person is subordinated. That is at the very bottom of the heap. So these are, this is really a fundamental difference. Okay, so features of Eris alien or we might call it [inaudible] alien psychology. One is we are teleological in the sense of being purposive. We have potential to realize and realizing that potential is essential to our happiness. It's not just getting more of what gives you utility. There's some developmental dimension to this. Second, the

Speaker 2:          18:53          okay,

Speaker 1:          18:53          the individual is subordinated to a practice and that translates into this idea of the community becoming before the individual in politics. But third and in some ways for Mcintyre story most important of all is that on the Aristotelian scheme, human nature is malleable, it's plastic, it can be shaped in different ways. And what is so deeply misguided about the enlightenment project from Mac and pious point of view is that it does not take account of this fact. It does not take account of the fact that human beings are malleable creatures. Human psychology is shaped by circumstances and

Speaker 2:          19:55          okay,

Speaker 1:          19:55          so when Russo says at the start of the social contract, I'm in a reason about politics taking manners, they are and laws as they might be. That underscores the fact that we're so is missing the developmental features of human psychology in reasoning about politics. And it's in missing that, that the enlightenment project went off the rails. So let's talk about Aristotle's scheme and then I let, let me just read this too, and then I will explain it if you haven't understood it. He says it in his description. We have a threefold scheme in which human nature, as it happens to be human nature in its untutored or raw state, is initially discrepant and discordant with the precepts of ethics and needs to be transformed by the instruction of practical reason and experience into human nature as it could be if it real the eyes. It's tell us each of the three elements of the scheme, the conception of untutored human nature, the conception of the precepts of irrational ethics and the conception of human nature as it could be if it realizes it's t loss requires reference to the other two if its status and function or to be in town.

Speaker 1:          21:29          Digable. So his point here is if you go back and read Aristotle, he had a view of raw or untutored or brute human nature, how we are when we are born. Then he had an account of human beings as they could be if they realize they're tell us their purposes. And then he had an account of the rules that get you from the one to the other, the rules, the norms that get you from the one to the other. And those are the rules of ethics. So what are the rules of ethics? The rules of ethics are those things that get you from untutored or raw human nature too.

Speaker 1:          22:23          The kinds of beings who realized that tell us or purposes. And that's why if you look at ancient philosophers like Aristotle or Plato, the two central features of their political theory that are completely absent. When you read, say John Rawls, a theory of family life and a theory of education, it would have been bizarre beyond imagining for Aristotle or Plato to think you could have a theory of politics that didn't put a huge amount of intention to those two things. Think of how many people in this room have read Plato's Republic, at least a good number of you think, how much of that's a book about politics. Think how much of that is about how to rear children and the system of education, uh, that has to prevail, right? Enormous amount of it. Probably half the book. It's nothing of that enrolls his theory of justice, right? On males account in on liberty. So it's a big difference. And the reason is, and the same is true of Aristotle's ethics and these other writings about politics. Lots of attention to education, to the family, um, to these things that are, that involves shaping this malleable plastic, human nature so that we have a good outcome rather than a bad outcome.

Speaker 2:          23:59          Right?

Speaker 1:          24:00          And so what, what bugs Macintyre, is he saying we want to derive the rules of ethics from human nature as it is, as we find it. But that's never gonna work because the rules of ethics I design to improve behavior, not to simply aggregate

Speaker 2:          24:30          behavior.

Speaker 1:          24:33          And so anything we design, anything we design that's just derived from people as they happen to be. It's gonna. It's gonna seem unsatisfying, satisfying to us and satisfactory to us. So you know, to go back to the examples we discussed, um, affirmative action, the ones he mentioned at the beginning of the book, abortion, affirmative action and so on. Yes, we're going to see people have different values and therefore different.

Speaker 2:          25:04          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          25:04          uh, views about those questions, but they're not going to be, they're not going to ultimately be satisfied with just recognizing their differences because they have inherited a whole language of talking about ethics that presumes these things can be resolved. That there, that there is it, there is more to ethical disagreement then just accepting the differences among us and that at the end of the day is why the enlightenment

Speaker 1:          25:42          project was a fool's errand. Since this is just mere Mcintyre's more eloquent and lucid statement of what I've been saying to you for the last five minutes, minutes that I'm capable of. He says since the moral injunctions were originally at home in a scheme in which their purpose was to correct, improve and educate human nature, they are clearly not going to be such as could be deduced from true statements about human nature. Just think of Bentham, he says, we are driven by pleasure seeking and pain avoiding. I'm going to derive a whole system from that right mackintosh saying that's crazy because these moral injunctions were designed to be at odds with human nature. The injunctions of morality that's understood, they're likely to be the ones that human nature has strong tendencies to disobey. Hence the 18th century moral philosophers engaged in what was inevitably an unsuccessful project for. They did indeed attempt to find a rational basis for their moral beliefs in a particular understanding of human nature while inheriting a set of moral injunctions on the one hand and a conception of human nature. On the other hand, which had been expressly designed to be discrepant with each other. They inherited incoherent fragments of a once coherence scheme of thought and action. And since they did not recognize their own peculiar historical and cultural situation, they could not recognize the impossible and quixotic character of their self appointed task.

Speaker 1:          27:38          Whether it's Ben, I'm trying to derive maxims of conduct from the posture, them pleasure seeking pain avoidance or Rousseau trying to, um,

Speaker 1:          27:53          come up with a system of government taking manners. They are, and they laws his name might be or can't, trying to see what principles human beings as they currently are, would affirm from every conceivable standpoint it's Naveh gonna work. The morality that comes out of this kind of reasoning is going to same. And actually we'll be unsatisfying to us. And so we, if you, if you now go back and look at some of the puzzles and conundrums we came up with when we were considering those different theories, Macintyre would say, well, you shouldn't be surprised. You shouldn't be surprised. Um, that object of utilitarianism puts, uh, allows people to take advantage of one another in appalling ways. And you shouldn't be surprised that subject of utilitarianism allows people to ignore one another in a Po Marley appalling ways, um, because what makes things seem morally appalling to you? Um, treat people with dignity. Um, don't lie, cheat and steal. These are maxims that, um, we know people have a tendency to disobey, right? And so that's the point of them, that to make us behave better and you're not going to be able to derive them in this sense from

Speaker 1:          29:36          a completely empirically accurate description of human beings as we find them in the wall. So it's a, it's a kind of secular doctrine of the fall, right? And in Christian, in Christian thinking, you know, we have the fall and then we have inadequate human beings and the possibility of redemption, the possibility of redemption through internalizing and accepting, um, Christ as your savior. The Sec, this is a secular version of the fall that we have.

Speaker 3:          30:10          MMM MMM.

Speaker 1:          30:14          Fallen the secular version of fallen man untutored ill formed human nature. And then we have what, what we could be if we, we are properly formed. And then the system of the rules of ethics that are going to get us from the one to the other. And it's, it's the virtues in within practices that, uh, achieving them w achieving lives lived in accordance with them that enable us to, um, realize our purposes in a good way. And it's, it's there the rules and norms governing those practices that get us from a to B.

Speaker 3:          31:00          And

Speaker 1:          31:02          the big problem with the enlightenment philosophically is what I've just said to you, that they try and engage in this quixotic task, but in politics itself,

Speaker 2:          31:15          okay,

Speaker 1:          31:16          it's the creation of an emotive as world. It's a creation of a world

Speaker 1:          31:22          that's separates, means from ends that values the instrumental reasoning, the world. You know, the business school world written large, the, the world in which we make ourselves agnostic about people's purposes and just try to set ourselves up as the most efficient executer of any purpose have skills. Well travel, right? I'm a consultant for what? Well, whatever you need, right? That's, that's what he finds politically shocking and appalling, but he thinks it's underpinned by this whole philosophical scheme. Now, Mcintyre wrote this during the, this book came out in 1984, which was at the height of the Cold War. You know, one of the points he was making was everybody thinks the, the, the great battle of our time is the confrontation between capitalism and communism. But for Macintyre, you know, these are two sides of the same coin because there they are both. They are both

Speaker 1:          32:41          ways in which this enlightenment project has been played out and politics and they're both for him. Appalling. So when we, you know, I started out saying to Mcintyre, thought of himself as a person on the political left, at least when he was young, when he wrote Marxism and Christianity and against the self images of the age and those holy books. But it's in a different sense. It's not like, you know, uh, Robert Bork said at one point in his confirmation hearings, you, you're already too young to remember this, but he, uh, they questioned him about his changing ideological beliefs. And at one point he said, well, I've always thought if you're not a socialist before the age of 30, you have no heart. And if you are a socialist after the age of 30, you have no head. Um, this isn't macintyre, right. He wants to say the whole enlightenment venture, whether it's in its capitalist or it's socialist form is a variant of this. Um,

Speaker 2:          33:54          yeah,

Speaker 1:          33:54          deeply muddled, hopeless quest,

Speaker 2:          33:59          mmm.

Speaker 1:          34:00          To develop a science of politics based on a human nature as we find it. And so his prescriptions are rather different. He says, what matters at this stage is the construction of local forms of community with within which civility and intellectual and moral life can be sustained through the new dark ages which are already upon us. He's not a utopian, he's a dystopian almost. And if the tradition of the virtues was able to survive the horrors of the loss dark ages, we're not entirely without grounds for hope this time. However, the barbarians are not waiting beyond the frontiers. They've already been governing and us for quite some time. And it is our lack of consciousness of deaths that constitutes part of our predicament. We're not, we are waiting not for Godot, but for another doubtless very different saint benedict. Now people criticized McEntire for a variety of things. But one of the things they criticized him for was this seems to be sort of throwing up your hands, uh, and saying, you know, the whole world is terrible. We're about to enter the new dark ages and there's not much we can do about it except hunkered down and hope.

Speaker 2:          35:24          MMM.

Speaker 1:          35:26          And he wrote several books that probably the most important of which is a book called whose justice, which rationality in an attempt to respond to these criticisms. But actually on the, on the on, I'll talk about some of that in, in a minute on the actual politics that flow from this. He never had anything more to say than this. So it's really, it is, it is a diagnosis without a cure. And if you, you know, I said this was written at the height of the Cold War. If you look at the post Cold War and you say, what would macintyre say today? Um, it's not at all clear because he certainly would not be a fan of militant Islam,

Speaker 1:          36:23          but it's not clear what he would, you know, he would, he would probably find the spread of globalization as just one more step in this appalling, a triumph of instrumental reasoning and values. So, uh, I think he would, he would, uh, he would be Joe, no less despondent. Um, and I think he's, he's diagnosis, this is pure speculation. I haven't had this conversation with them, but my guess is that his diagnosis of militant Islam and jihadism and all of that would be, he would just say, well, it's, it's an inevitable undertow. It's an inevitable reaction by the losers from globalization against, uh, against the, the, the endless spread, um, of, um, enlightenment ideas. Uh, I think in some ways that could be a more interesting makin and Tyrion analysis of China in that, in China, you know, we see now the fusion of comment as politics and capitalist economics, neither of which I was any signs of going anywhere. And so the, the, you know, when in 1984 somebody had said, well, capitalism and communism are two sides of the same coin. People would have been quite dismissive when you think about China today. Um, you know, it's, it's quite thought provoking.

Speaker 1:          38:01          Okay. So that's Macintyre in a nutshell.

Speaker 2:          38:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:09          Lots of, it's quite appealing.

Speaker 1:          38:12          You know, this account of human beings, how many people that, never mind the on realism of the pilot. How many find the, this account of human nature plausible, true to your own experience. At least some, not that money. We do, you know, we want, we're, we're, we're sort of lots of unrequited love, right? We, we want to be liked. We want, we want to be wanted and we want to be wanted by cool people or people we think are cool. All right? So that whole side of it seems right and the notion that political morality should somehow be an improving thing seems right. That it can't, you can't just derive it from the, um, as Russo said it, if you take all of our individual preferences and add them up and get rid of the pluses and minuses that cancel one another out, uh, that's maybe the general, well, but you know, Macintyre would say it's going to be the lowest common denominator, right? It's going to cater to our base instincts and we are malleable shapeable a improvable creatures and we're not happy unless that actually happening. So all of that seems right. But on the other hand, as I mentioned to you,

Speaker 2:          39:37          yeah,

Speaker 1:          39:37          Mcintyre makes one huge concession.

Speaker 2:          39:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:44          To the way of thinking that at least motivated the enlightenment, which was that Aristotle was wrong to say we don't reason about ends now Aristotle took ends is given and said, we only reason about means. So the big pile, the big challenge for Mac and tie is to say, well, how do you, how do you say, okay, and this can be put in question as subject for debate, but not then wind up with emotive ism.

Speaker 1:          40:27          How do you, how do you structure, how do you put limits? If you like on debates about ends, which recognizes that people do in fact, you know, a difference between human beings and uh, and dogs let's say, or lions, is that dogs in lions can't think critically about their own ends. They just think instrumentally about how their ends. So really are given, you know, dog wants to sit on a warm couch, Elian wants to kill a buck. And there's not no question about that for a dog or alliance, how you get on a warm couch without being kicked off at by some nasty human, uh, that's a question for a dog, but not whether you want to be on right. Human beings aren't like that. Human beings are capable of thinking critically about purposes and goals. So we have the, we, you know, what Macintyre wants to say is we have the structure of an Aristotelian psyche, but not the content we do. We are not men. And, uh, lions in, in that sense, we can critically appraise how goals, but then we can argue about them and then we can disagree about them and we can even have civil wars about them. Uh, when it really gets down to it. Right? So what do you do with the fact that we reasoned about goals?

Speaker 2:          41:52          Okay.

Speaker 1:          41:54          That's why introduces the concept of a practice. He says, well, it's true. We reasoned about goals, but we don't pluck them from nowhere.

Speaker 2:          42:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:03          We're born into practices where the goals are defined, where, you know, the goal of chess is to get the person checkmate with as many of their pieces on the board as possible. You don't say, let's invent a board game. You say, what are the goals of chess? Okay. And so,

Speaker 2:          42:23          okay,

Speaker 1:          42:24          they're given by practices or communities. And if we think about what is a practice or a community over time, it's a tradition, right? And so what he wants to say is we are born into practices and communities and we reproduce them into the future, uh, simply by living in them. We inherit, we live and we reproduce into the future. So it's a little reminiscent or perhaps even more than a little reminiscent of Berks line about, yes, we are a part of a social contract, but it's a contract among those who are dead. Those who are living in those who are yet to be born. Right. And so yes, we do question,

Speaker 1:          43:14          you know, you might play chess for law on and say, well, is it, should it really be the goal of chess to beat the person with as many of their pieces on the board as possible? Why maybe you may be getting, getting their pieces on the way they are, the subordinate subordinated pieces on the way to before the check made. It should be a goal of chess, you know, and you could have a debate, is it, does it take more skill to knock off the knights and the bishops and so on in order and then get the checkmate? Or does it take more scale to get the Person Checkmate with their knights and Bishops on the board? And that could be a debate you could have, but it's a very, it's a contained debate. It's a structured debate, right? And he wants to say, our debates about ends are always like that,

Speaker 1:          44:08          you know, think about debates getting closer to home for Mcintyre. I think about debates within the Catholic church, you know, the next generation of Catholics doesn't say, should we have a church? Should it be organized? Should the bishop of Rome have a special status? Should there be a papal infallibility? No. You're born into a structure that's already there. And then maybe you say, Whoa, Whoa, why is there papal infallibility? It only, it's only relatively recent creation. Does it make, you know? So your questioning of vans is always from the vantage point of somebody who's born into an inherited tradition. And it doesn't make sense to criticize it from the perspective about a space. It doesn't make sense to any of the participants and it won't ultimately give you any answers that will be of any in any sense, meaningful to you. Right. And so he sees traditions as the, as the, um,

Speaker 2:          45:16          okay.

Speaker 1:          45:17          Mechanisms through which practices are reproduced over time. And He, and he wants to say, yes, there is argument about ends. We then traditions. But it's always this kind of structured argument that is shaped by the way in which questions come up within traditions. He says somewhere of course. Um, part of, part of what it means to be a Jew is to argue about what it means to be a Jew. That within the Jewish tradition that that is one of the things that people argue about and disagree about. But it's always going to be this bounded structured disagreement that brings to bear other, other ideas within the tradition, within the tradition on some particular traditional plain, if you, if for those of you who are like philosophical jargon, Michael Walzer wrote a book, uh, along comparable lines where he talked about the idea that the, the only effective criticism is imminent criticism, which is a bit like imminent for walls is a bit like internal for Mcintyre. If you want, if you want to influence Catholics to change their behavior, you're not going to influence them unless you appeal to values. They embrace to norms, they embrace to elements of the tradition they accept and showed them how they, um, are undermined by the particular thing that you are criticizing. So, internal criticism, imminent criticism, not ex Cathedra criticism made, uh, from outside a whole system of norms and values, practices, institutions. Uh, you might think you're right, but you'll know it'll, it'll never have an effect.

Speaker 2:          47:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          47:15          On the people you're trying to influence. So is very much in that spirit. We can argue and reason about ends, but only from inside traditions and practices. Um, okay, we're out of time and we, I will finish up with this and then start talking about democracy on Monday.
