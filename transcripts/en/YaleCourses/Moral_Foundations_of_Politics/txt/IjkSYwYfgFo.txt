Speaker 1:          00:01          Where we ended with last Wednesday was the tail end of our discussion of the Anti enlightenment. And I think some of you discussed in section the difficulties that arise when you think about the complete rejection of the enlightenment project. For instance, I think a very dramatic example that fixes our intuition's very quickly, um, is the, is the example that I know some of you discussed, which is that in the 1950s in the United States, there was no such thing as marital rape. We can remember this from our discussion of male. Um, the wife was the channel of the husband and her legal identity was suspended, uh, for the course of the marriage. And she was not only could a husband not be prosecuted for raping his wife, he could not be prosecuted for assault. You could not be prosecuted for doing all kinds of things to her that if he did it to some on unrelated person on the street, uh, would land him in jail or worse.

Speaker 1:          01:15          Um, now if you think about Macintyre's discussion of practices in the 1950s, this was an accepted norm of the prevailing practice. And the argument that this should be seen as unjust or unacceptable wouldn't get any purchase from an ethic that was based on the idea that, um, we missed except inherited conditions and norms and practices. And so, um, the, the one important takeaway point from that is however difficult the enlightenment ideas of individual rights and trying to make, um, objective statements about what goes on within systems of Human Association is however difficult that enlightenment project is giving up on a completely presents even more in Superbowl problems because very few people are really going to want to go all the way with abandoning the idea that the individual should be subordinated to community norms and practices and abandoning the notion that we can appeal only to tradition in, um, thinking about, um, whether or not conditions as we've inherited them are acceptable and so entered democracy.

Speaker 1:          02:43          The last section of the course in which we're going to talk about a tradition which I think does a better job than any that we have considered here. The two, in delivering on the promise of the mature enlightenment, the promise to recognize individual rights as the most important normative, ideal and to base politics on some commitment to objective knowledge about human society. Um, that goes beyond the, um, beliefs, commitments and practices of whoever happens to be around and whatever values they happen to have. Now, one thing about democracy that distinguishes it from all of the traditions we've considered thus far is that it's a tradition that was made famous by it's critics. If you think about the ones we've considered thus far, you know, the social contract was made famous by Hobbes and Locke. A utilitarianism was made famous by Bentham. Marxism obviously made famous by marks. These will all, um, the, these were all ways of looking at the world that had their champions and it was the champions that made the case for why we should behave in accordance with their dictates. And with the inland anti enlightenment as well, it was Burke as the big champion of the Anti Enlightenment. And then we looked at some modern anti enlightenment thinkers. Democracy was made famous by it's critics.

Speaker 1:          04:36          Who Do you think this is? Any guesses? Who is that on the left? That Jen on the left. Nobody now nobody wanted get who's that? Yeah. Close. Huh? Okay. Who is the [inaudible] the right. Anyone the first one to get it gets a free book. Yeah, you got it. Come and see me later. You'll get your free book. Um, okay. These are both people who were not champions of democracy.

Speaker 2:          05:17          MMM.

Speaker 1:          05:20          They were worried about the potential that democracy has four tyranny. Let's listen to Plato. I don't know if you can read that, but I'll read it to you and don't try and write it down. I will put it up on the uh, server. Plato has two very famous analogies in the, in the republic, which sum up his appalling disdain for democracy. He says, imagine then a fleet or a ship in which there is a captain who is taller and stronger than any of the crew, but he is a little deaf and has a similar infirmity insight and his knowledge of navigation is not much better. Kind of dopey old captain. The sailors are quarreling with one another about the steering. Everyone is of the opinion that he has the right to steer. Though he has never learned the art of navigation and cannot tell who taught him or when he learned and will further assert that a cat that it cannot be toward and that they are all ready to cut to pieces.

Speaker 1:          06:26          Anyone who says the contrary, they throng about the captain begging and praying him to commit the helm to them. And if at any time they do not prevail but others are preferred to them, they kill the others with throw them overboard. And having first chained up the Nobels captain senses with drink or some narcotic drug, they mutiny and take possession of the ship and make free with the stores. Thus eating and drinking. They proceed on their voyage in such a manner as might be expected of them. Him who is their partisan and cleverly aids them in their plot for getting the ship out of the captain's hands and into their own, uh, whether by force or persuasion, they compliment with the name of Salem pilot, able seaman and abused the other sort of man with whom they call a good, whom they call a good for nothing, but that the true pilot must pay attention to the year and the seasons and the sky and the stars and the wind and whatever else belongs to his art.

Speaker 1:          07:31          If he intends to be really qualified to command a shit. Now in vessels which are in a state of now in vessels which are in a state of mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers, how will a true pilot be regarded Willie and not be called by them a pray to a star gazer or a good for nothing. And then Plato's other famous analogy which looks at the masses rather than uh, how they will manipulate the government. He says, suppose a man was in charge of a large and powerful animal and made a study of its moods. And once he would learn when to approach it and handle it when and Wyatt was especially savage or gentle, what the different noises it made meant and what the tone of voice, what tone of voice to to use to sue that or to annoy it. All those he might learn by long experience and familiarity and then call it a science and reduce it to a system and set up to teach it.

Speaker 1:          08:39          But he would not really know what the, which of the chicest tastes and desires was admirable or shameful, good or bad, right or wrong. He would simply use the terms on the basis of its reactions, calling what it pleased good and what place did go ahead and what annoyed it bad. So Plato didn't have much regard for democracy. Not surprisingly because in three 99 BC, it, the democracy in Athens at executed his hero and teach us Socrates, um, precisely for pointing out the sorts of lack of knowledge that he is alluding to here, both in the ship's captain analogy and I'm playing to the mob sentiments, um, that he's alluding to with the, um, this, this analogy of the power of the people in a democratic system as being a powerful animal. And so Plato was very unimpressed with democracy as a potential system of rural.

Speaker 1:          09:48          He thought it would quickly collapse into charity. The phrase that tyranny of the majority though was made popular by Alexis de Tocqueville. You've already run into this. When we talked about mill's harm principle. Um, Tocqueville was a 19th century French aristocrat who, who went to America to try and understand how American democracy work because it seemed to him less destructive of freedom and individual liberties. Then what was coming down the pike in Europe, he thought the French aristocracy and, and the French monarchy was way too short sighted in not seeing that they have to understand the egalitarian trends of modern history and to create institutions that could lose sue them and control them and domesticate them. So people think of Tocqueville often is a great defender of democracy and in a certain sense he was. But he was also a critic of democracy. And I'll go into that a little bit more detail shortly.

Speaker 1:          11:00          Um, but, but his main reason for thinking that American democracy was a relatively good system was its propensity to limit egalitarian impulses, uh, that he thought were breaking out all over Europe. And so Tocqueville's summation of his fear of the tyranny of the majority comes, um, in, in a democracy in America. He says, when I see that the right and the means of absolute control are conferred on any power, whatever, be it called a people or a king, an aristocracy or democracy, a monarchy or a republic. I say there is the germ of tyranny and I s and I seek to live elsewhere. And to other lawyers. In my opinion, the main eval of the present democratic institutions. The United States does not arise as it's often asserted in Europe from their weakness, but from the irresistible strength. I am not so much alarmed at the excessive liberty which rains in that country as as in the inadequate securities, which one finds their against tyranny and individual or a party is wronged in the United States.

Speaker 1:          12:23          If an individual or a party has wronged in the United States, to whom can he apply for redress? If to public opinion, public opinion constitutes the majority if to the legislature. It represents the majority and implicitly obeys it. If the executive power it is appointed by the majority and serves as a passive tool in its hands. The public force consists of the majority on the arms. The jury is the majority invested with the right of hearing judicial cases and in certain states, even the judges are elected by the majority. However, iniquitous or absurd, the measure of which you complain, you must submit to it as well as you can. So democracy brings with it this problem of the tyranny of the majority. And it was after all we saw earlier in this course against that that John Stuart mill erected his harm principle. He too had this great fear of tyranny of the majority.

Speaker 1:          13:29          And so as I said, democracy was made famous first by it's critics. And they point out that it has this propensity to panda to mass opinion without regard to whether it's true or false and to ride roughshod over the individual rights, uh, again without regard to whether this produces a domination or worse. Um, so that being the case, it seems like prime of facie and not very encouraging to think that democracy can deliver on the enlightenment where we talking about politics that's based on science and politics that respect individual rights. And so you might given reading mail as you have given what I, the little bit of Plato and Russo that I've just shown to you and your own thinking about, um, politics. As you confront it day today, you might well be skeptical of the proposition that democracy is going to deliver very well on the mature enlightenment. And so just how that might be the case is what's going to concern us for this. And then the next three lectures, and we're going to start out consideration of democracy with the federalist papers. The federalist papers are probably along with roles, the two most important pieces of political theory ever to come out of America. Um, they were a series of articles published in the newspapers of New York state, as I'm sure most of you know, uh, in order to try and help get the constitution ratified.

Speaker 1:          15:44          They were, although Orthod by these three gentlemen, James Madison Alexandre Habel Ah, how Hamilton and John Jay, they were signed by the night with the pseudonym Publius, which was short for poor bliss, hilarious public Carla, who was reputed to be the console who had restored the Roman Republic in five Oh nine BC, whether in fact it is a at that's debated by historians. Um, the constitution, by the time they wrote these, the vast majority of these papers, these letters to the people of New York had already been approved by the majority of the 13 states if bought. Um, few people believe that it would survive if it wasn't, uh, um, adopted in New York. Uh, the, the confederate constitution it provide had, had required unanimity for the adoption of the constitution. But in the, the actual constitution itself, they had said, well, nine out of the 13 states will be enough, but nobody really thought it could survive if it was not adopted in New York. And so the federalists took upon themselves the task, um, Hamilton, Madison and Jay up persuading the p the people of New York to support the adoption of the constitution. And indeed they were successful in that endeavor.

Speaker 2:          17:35          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          17:36          But they had the fear of this problem of majority tyranny that I've already alluded to with respect to Plato and, um, male and Tocqueville front and in their considerations. And [inaudible] two shouldn't be surprised that they would worry about that because if you imagine yourself back into the 18th century, thinking about democracy.

Speaker 2:          18:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:10          The ancient ideal of democracy, the ancient Athenian ideal of democracy had basically been the notion of ruling and being ruled in term. So, you know, if you have an academic department, let's say, let's set aside the problem, the issue of, of untenured faculty. Just imagine a a department of tenured faculty, we have a circulating chair, right? Somebody chair for three years, then somebody else, then somebody else. That's the notion of ruling and being ruled in turn. And the reason you can do that is that everybody basically has the same interest.

Speaker 2:          18:52          Okay?

Speaker 1:          18:53          You don't have to worry about monitoring or controlling the current ruler because basically they have the same interest as you do. Um, and they're not therefore going to do anything with the collective that you wouldn't do yourself. So that's the ancient ideal of democracy is ruling and being ruled. In turn it, it obviously in the case of ancient Greece, it excluded women at excluded slaves. So, um, it was, uh, a certain, uh, truncated conception of a democratic community about which people of discourse that great length. But given that the model was the idea that you could have a ruling and being ruled in turn without loss because everyone was assumed basically to have the same interests. Now, as soon as you get a diversity of interests,

Speaker 2:          19:52          that

Speaker 1:          19:55          mechanism of government goes off the table as a way of doing things. Because then you might have subgroups who see that let's suppose you introduce nontenured faculty, they're going to have a very different interest than the tenured faculty. And so the idea of ruling and being ruled in turn, uh, wouldn't work anymore. Once you have a serious division of interest within, within the polity, you have this problem. And this is the problem Madison articulates in federalist number 10 when he says by a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the hall who are United and actuated by some common impulse of passion or interest adverse to the rights of other citizens or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community. So once you have factions, you have this problem,

Speaker 2:          21:05          right?

Speaker 1:          21:07          If you're the majority faction, it doesn't matter to you, but it does if you're the minority faction because things are gonna happen

Speaker 2:          21:17          you don't like.

Speaker 1:          21:21          So the first thing Madison says to himself is, what could we get rid of factions? And, and if you read federalist number 10 carefully, you will see that he thinks that the, the costs of doing that would be so great in terms of lost human freedom and the kind of repression you would have to engage in. Uh, you know, it would look like the French revolution or the Russian revolution, which of course he didn't know about, but which, uh, he didn't know about either of those things, but he wouldn't have been surprised by them.

Speaker 2:          21:58          Uh, when, uh,

Speaker 1:          22:02          he wrote this, so you can't get rid of factions. The causes of factions can't be removed and therefore you have to look at their effects. He says the Leighton causes of faction or sewn in the nature of man, and we see them everywhere brought into different degrees of activity according to the different circumstances of civil society. So strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities that were no substantial occasion presents itself. The most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle the unfriendly passions and excite the most violent conflicts by the most common and durable source of. But the most common and durable sorts of factions has been the various unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have formed distinct interests in society. Those who are credit is, and those who are dead is fall under like discrimination, uh, landed interest, a manufacturing interest and merch until interest and moneyed interest with many lessons, interest grow up off necessity in civilized nations and divide them into different classes, actuated by different sentiments in views. The regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal task of modern legislation and involves the spirit of party and faction in the necessary an ordinary operations of government managing factions so that they don't destroy the common interest is the basic business of politics.

Speaker 2:          23:52          Now,

Speaker 1:          23:57          how do you do that? Well, how do you manage the effects of faction? He goes on and he says, the smaller the society, the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and interest composing it. The fewer the distinct parties and interest. The more frequently, well a majority be found of the same party and the smaller the number of individuals composing a majority and the smaller the compass within which they are placed the more easily we'll they concert and execute their plans of oppression.

Speaker 1:          24:39          Oops, extend the sphere and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests. You make it less probable that a majority of the hall we'll have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens. Or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel of it. Feel it to discover their own strength and to act in unison with each other. Besides other impediments, it may be remarked that where there is a consciousness of unjust or dishonorable purposes, communication is always checked by distrust in proportion of the number who's a concurrence is necessary. Hence it clearly appears that the same advantage which a republic has over a democracy and controlling the effects of faction is enjoyed by a large over a small republic. Isn't is enjoyed by the Union of the States Union over the states comprising it. I will talk in a little while about what advantages Madison thinks a republic has over a democracy.

Speaker 1:          25:47          But right now I want to focus on his this other point which is that a large republic has an advantage over a small republic. It's society had that has no factions at all presents no problems for four democratic theory as we've already talked about in connection with the stylized idea of ancient Greece as one in which everybody has the same interests and you can have rules and being ruled in turn ruling and being ruled in turn what Madison is most afraid off is a single faction I majority faction because if you have a society in which um, there's a majority that agrees all the time or most of the time the problem is what about these people that are going to be

Speaker 2:          26:46          okay

Speaker 1:          26:46          on the losing end. So if you have a society in which race and class and religion all tend to fall along the same division,

Speaker 2:          26:57          okay,

Speaker 1:          26:58          these people are either going to be

Speaker 2:          27:00          okay,

Speaker 1:          27:01          have to knuckle down to tyranny, right? Or they're going to reach where they had guns.

Speaker 1:          27:10          They'll overthrow the system if they can. And if they cannot, they might as well become criminals, right? They're not going to have an incentive to participate in the democratic order. And so from Madison's point of view, this is the ideal society. You know, we think, you know, modern Polen 99% Catholic or something like that. Um, but even there that there are other divisions. So even there it doesn't work. But if you're going to have factions, the worst thing to have is one or a small number. What you really want is lots of factions, cross cutting cleavages as we talk about them in modern political science. The notion here is if you're in a majority on one question, but you know, you might be on in a different majority or in the minority on the next question,

Speaker 2:          28:14          okay?

Speaker 1:          28:15          Then you have both the reason to temper your own behavior when you're in the majority and not tyrannized over the minority. And if you're in the minority, you have reasons to accept your loss this time around. You know, as, as people always say, when the team loses the weld series, there's always next year, right? There's always next time. So next time you might be part of some different coalition and you might be able to prevail. So the best, the best we could have would be a world with no factions at all. But that's unrealistic in modern times, particularly once you have an economic division of Labor class divisions,

Speaker 2:          29:05          um, uh,

Speaker 1:          29:07          as Tocqueville would, would, uh, point out 40 years later.

Speaker 2:          29:13          MMM.

Speaker 1:          29:16          And so then what you need is lots of factions and that's why Madison argued you need a big republic, right? Because the larger the republic, the more likely it is that you're going to have multiple cross cutting cleavages and then the system, we sometimes defined democracy as institutionalized of outcomes. You don't know, you don't know what the majority is going to decide.

Speaker 2:          29:50          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          29:51          We don't know when, uh, if, let's suppose President Obama nominates,

Speaker 2:          29:59          mmm,

Speaker 1:          30:03          justice would for the court, we don't know what the outcome will be. So everybody will participate and lobby and so on to try and affect the result. Um, people will talk about coalitions and, or you know, a more dramatic case. I think when George Bush Sr nominated Clarence Thomas to the supreme court, it split the African American community right down the middle, right? Because there were people who were largely Democrats who also wanted an African American justice on the court. The, a good example of cross cutting bases of political affiliation, right? And so the, the Madisonian idea is that that's actually a good thing. It's institutionalized uncertainty of outcomes prevents the terrorizing of some groups. Have A, this at gives everybody an incentive to remain committed to the process. And that is what would subsequently become call the pluralist theory of democracy associated most famously in the 20th century with Robert Dahl, who was on the Yale Faculty for decades and decades and is still, it's about to turn actually 95 years old this year.

Speaker 1:          31:24          Uh, and he lives in new haven. Um, probably the most famous democratic theorist, um, of the second half of the 20th century. The pluralist theory of democracy belts on this Madisonian idea that what you want is institutionalized uncertainty of outcomes. That is a byproduct of crosscutting. Cleavage is multiple cross cutting cleavages so that witness have reason. President winters have reason to, uh, limit the amount in which they tear an over losers and present losers have incentives to remain committed to the process for the future. There's always next year you want people to believe that, uh, in order to keep them committed. But that wasn't enough for Madison. No, that was the basis of his argument for an extended a union. Um, but it wasn't enough for Madison. He was worried that the institutional structure, just as Tocqueville articulated it, um, in the 19th century, that the institutional structure could facilitate tyranny.

Speaker 2:          32:48          Okay.

Speaker 1:          32:49          He says the greatest security against the gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department consists in giving to those who administer each of the departments, each department, the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of others. The provision for defense must in this, as in all other cases, be commensurate to the danger of the task. Ambition must be made to counteract ambition. Maybe the most famous line Madison ever wrote, ambition must be made to counteract ambition. The interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place. It may be a reflection of human nature that such devices should be necessary to control the abuses of government. Now, the famous line, if men were angels, whoops, if men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary in framing a government, which is to be administered by men over men. The great different the lies in this, you must first enable the government to control the governed and next oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is no doubt the primary control of the government, but experience has taught mankind the next set and the necessity of auxiliary precautions. So your basic guarantor is the, the,

Speaker 2:          34:42          mmm

Speaker 1:          34:44          crosscutting cleavages among the people and extended republic. But that's not enough because, and this is really a, a view that most famously associated with the 19th century liberal British thing. Lord Acton, when he said power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. The notion is that you really have to divide up power. You have to have an institutional scheme. That's is an auxiliary precautions, an institutional scheme which causes people in the different branches of government to check one another.

Speaker 1:          35:31          And so we'd get what Madison called a nonorganic or republic rather than a democracy. Uh, and in that sense, Madison is a critic of democracy, just like Tocqueville, uh, beef, uh, and just like Plato, they wanted to say that pure democracy leads to tyranny and we have to check it with an institutional scheme that limits what can be done. And so, uh, the American system so called checks and balances, which you also learned about in high school civics courses, structures, the constitutional system that they created. And it is, this is something that you can tell from the passage from Tocqueville that I read you, that Tocqueville didn't fully understand or appreciate because he thought that every branch of the government was ultimately controlled by the majority and the designers of the constitution intended rather, um, to have them at least controlled in different ways by majority opinion. But more importantly to set up a scheme in which they would control one another.

Speaker 1:          36:52          Ambition would be made to counteract ambition. And so you would you, we've all been reading in the newspapers, uh, this weekend at the moment of their retirement of, of Justice John Paul Stevens, uh, that he was, he was one of the people, for instance, who checked the expansion of executive power I after nine 11. And the harm done case by saying it was unconstitutional to use military tribunals to try, uh, the Guantanamo Bay detainees from the point of view of Madison. This specific issue is not what's important here, but rather that what we saw after nine 11, which is a big expansion of executive power.

Speaker 2:          37:45          Okay.

Speaker 1:          37:46          Right. And then you see an assertion of power by different branch to say to the executive, no, you can't do that. And so our limiting of executive power in this case by the judicial branch, and so what you have in the American scheme, the American constitutional scheme is a large number of Vito points. First of all, we have the bill of rights. The bill of rights was enacted after the constitution, but only when undertakings had been made, uh, than it would be enacted in most of the state legislatures. So it was basically, even though it came, there was an informal agreement by the time the constitution was adopted that they would be a bill of rights. That what became the first 10 amendments that would limit the power of the central government. And so we have a bill of rights and then we have super majority requirements, most obviously to change the constitution.

Speaker 1:          39:03          Huge, super majority requirements, right? To amend the constitution. It's very difficult. You need two thirds in both houses of Congress and then three quarters of the states. Some of your parents were around at the last serious effort to amend the constitution, namely the era, the equal rights amendment, which failed to get that, to pass that threshold very hard. But then we have other super majority requirements, uh, the filibuster rule in the Senate, which we may see come into play and Supreme Court confirmation hearings. That's not in the constitution, but it's, it's a super majority requirement. Uh, nonetheless that we've embedded in our institutional scheme. Anytime you add super majority requirements,

Speaker 2:          39:56          okay.

Speaker 1:          39:57          Anytime you add super majority requirement, you make it harder for the current majority to work. It's well separation of powers already alluded to, uh, the court versus the executive, the legislature versus the executive. The notion that ambition of players in one branch will counteract the ambition of plas in a different branch. Greatly debated subject. Uh, how effective can the branches really be to check one another after all, the court does not have an army at its disposal. You know, if the court had,

Speaker 2:          40:47          mmm,

Speaker 1:          40:50          you guys are young enough to remember the 2000 election when we had a knife edge result and partisans on both side was saying that candidate won and it was being litigated in various ways through the state courts in Florida and we didn't have a clear result. Um, and finally the Supreme Court in Bush v Gore ruled in a very controversial decision.

Speaker 2:          41:20          Okay.

Speaker 1:          41:21          That President Bush was the winner. Well then candidate Bush was the winner and Vice President Gore was the loser and Gore stood on national

Speaker 2:          41:34          television and he said, I accept the result. I don't agree with the result, but I accept the result.

Speaker 1:          41:43          He didn't have to. You could imagine in many countries at that point, the Clinton administration would have sent the tanks down Pennsylvania Avenue. What would the court have been able to do?

Speaker 2:          41:58          Nothing. Right?

Speaker 1:          42:02          It's far from obvious in Iraq, right? That the, the loser of the erection is going to accept the result. So there's, there's great debate cause the, the Madison Madison makes heavy weather in the federalist papers of the proposition that just writing something on a parchment doesn't guarantee that people are gone except what you, right.

Speaker 2:          42:31          Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:32          So what does it really mean to say that there's separation of powers?

Speaker 1:          42:41          Was the court ultimately is dependent upon people just going along with what it says? Right. And likewise with the legislature. Um, yes. You know, they just, there's this attempt to separate congress. Congress votes in theory only Congress can declare war and Congress has to fund the military. Um, but in practice it's very difficult for Congress to resist what the executive branch wants to do on the all of those things. And when we look at cases where the court faces down, even either the legislature or the executive branch, it's usually only in cases where what they're doing is very popular when they're doing, you know, when they telling Nixon to turn over the tapes, 1974, 1973 74, uh, it's unanimous cord and it's a popular action. Um, if Nixon had been at 95% in the opinion polls at that time, it's less clear that the court would have faced down the executive branch or at least so some scholars claim.

Speaker 1:          44:02          So how much you really get separation of powers is, is a subject that's greatly debated by political scientists because at the end of the day, despite what Madison says, separation of powers is just something written on a parchment as Dall puts it in his critique of Madison in the preface to democratic theory is most important book, which was published in 1956 and it's still in print. Very few of us can say we wrote a book, uh, 50 years ago that's still in print, but there it is, it is still in print. Um, the all says, the problem with this famous, this famous one liner of Madison's is that there's actually no real mechanism to ensure that ambition will counteract ambition. And it's rare. That is simply that people accept this scheme. But what if they didn't? What if in 1800, that had not been a turnover of power? We had a knife Angela section in 1800.

Speaker 2:          45:17          MMM

Speaker 1:          45:19          maybe that would have made America

Speaker 2:          45:23          mmm.

Speaker 1:          45:25          Much more prone to the, the seizure of power by, um, those who currently controlled the levers of power, the military on. So we didn't, we had it, the loser gave up in 1800 and we began to create this culture of democratic trends, turnovers where the, the government loses an election and gives up power. Very unusual thing, but it happens. So separation of powers, much debated, and I'm going to come back to this, um, much debated as to how effective and important it really is.

Speaker 1:          46:06          More veto points. We have bicameralism as you know, from reading the federalist papers, the founders were mostly worried about the power of Congress because it seemed like it was going to be the most powerful branch if the executive was weak and designed to be weaker, much weaker than it is today. And so they thought the thing to do is to divide. Congress have a by camera system and legislation has to be passed in both houses and have them elected by different rules. So we have, um, Senate seats elected at large in the states, whereas we have small congressional districts and therefore we have very different incentives that the politicians are going to react to very different factions overlapping with one another, uh, in different ways to get back to the basic pluralist ideal. And then finally of course last but by no means least in terms of veto points, federalism, federalism is in another source of

Speaker 2:          47:21          yeah.

Speaker 1:          47:21          Vito points in what can actually happen. Thank in your, in the last few years of debates about gay marriage, you know, we have marital law is State Law.

Speaker 2:          47:40          MMM.

Speaker 1:          47:41          And for a long time there has been,

Speaker 2:          47:44          okay.

Speaker 1:          47:44          A federal law which says if you get married in one state, the marriage will be recognized and in every other state. So if people move and then later on they get divorced to one dies. It doesn't matter what state you were in for the purposes of the divorce or full probate law, you are still going to be governed by it. Just a sort of utilitarian efficiency thing. Yeah. Every state can have differences in it's marital law. But California has got a recognized Connecticut's marriages as valid. Then along comes a socially divisive issue like gay marriage.

Speaker 2:          48:26          Okay.

Speaker 1:          48:26          And unsurprisingly, some states, one to enact gay marriage and some don't. But then this federal requirement that all states recognize one another's marriages suddenly becomes ideologically charged, right? Whereas it was presented as just a utilitarian, efficient thing. Now it becomes ideologically charged because if the state of Massachusetts recognizes gay marriage, then in implicitly means that the state of Georgia has to recognize it as well. So you'd get an upsurge of political activism. And finally the defense of Marriage Act in Congress to preserve the rights of the states to reject or accept,

Speaker 2:          49:20          mmm.

Speaker 1:          49:21          Gay Marriage. And so that's an example of the veto power of states in play, uh, that, that, uh, rears its head in a setting like that. And so what you have in the U S is not a democracy, certainly not a pure democracy. You rather have what they design was what they referred to as a non tyrannical republic. They thought that that was the best they could do. They had misgivings about a lot of it, but they thought that this was the only way.

Speaker 2:          49:59          Okay.

Speaker 1:          49:59          They could create the Union and head off civil war. Of course, they did set off set. We had civil war. Anyway, a subject I'll come back to on Wednesday, but we created this hybrid between a what and and non tyrannical republic, if you like, and democratic system and many of our arguments about contemporary democracy are really arguments about how much we should preserve this hybrid and how much we should have a thoroughgoing democratic system. And I'll take that up on Wednesday.
