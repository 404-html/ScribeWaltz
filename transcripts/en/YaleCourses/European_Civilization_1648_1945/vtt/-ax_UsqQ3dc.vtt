1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.950
We talked about different,

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:02.281
you know,

3
00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:04.830
political outcomes and you know,

4
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:06.090
over the long run,

5
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:06.901
uh,

6
00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:09.390
Great Britain becomes a,

7
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.080
uh,

8
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.170
remains a constitutional monarchy.

9
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.540
And even in the 19th century when Victoria,

10
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.771
I had great,

11
00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:17.040
uh,

12
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.480
great prestige,

13
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.710
um,

14
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.300
she did not have great power,

15
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.241
uh,

16
00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:23.041
in the Netherlands,

17
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:26.580
also resisted absolutism and the Dutch republic,

18
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.370
uh,

19
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.540
uh,

20
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.920
remained the Dutch republic,

21
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:30.660
although for reasons that we'll see later,

22
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.110
uh,

23
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.110
the Dutch republic a ceases to be a great power I in the 18th century.

24
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.470
So I given the very different route that Prussia and Austria and Russia and

25
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.520
Sweden and France went,

26
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.540
uh,

27
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.050
with,

28
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.581
uh,

29
00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:48.960
a centralization of absolute rule.

30
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.240
Why did it work out so differently for a England slash Britain,

31
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.021
uh,

32
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:55.830
and,

33
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.910
and the Netherlands.

34
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.200
So we just want to,

35
00:00:58.201 --> 00:00:58.531
again,

36
00:00:58.531 --> 00:00:58.981
this is a,

37
00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:01.680
the second and last of these sort of holding pattern lectures.

38
00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:04.260
This parallels exactly what you're reading,

39
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.860
uh,

40
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.693
because again,

41
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.190
until we get our class set and all that,

42
00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:13.191
and then a very different kind of lecture starting on Wednesday,

43
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.160
Wednesday or Monday,

44
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.270
next Monday.

45
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.200
Um,

46
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.501
so,

47
00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:19.500
but let's just think a lot about what these places had in common and what this

48
00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:20.370
tells you about,

49
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.150
uh,

50
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.541
uh,

51
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:25.830
about social structure and political outcomes in early modern Europe.

52
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.701
And of course,

53
00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:28.260
the consequences are enormous,

54
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.980
uh,

55
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.300
for other kinds of outcomes.

56
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:31.350
Let me give you an example.

57
00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:31.710
Uh,

58
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.330
Germany,

59
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.760
uh,

60
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.700
is not unified until 1871.

61
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:36.211
Uh,

62
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:38.580
ironically a unification proclaimed in the,

63
00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:39.870
in the hall of Mirrors,

64
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:40.470
uh,

65
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.760
at the Chateau Versailles,

66
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.650
which we'll visit for a few seconds,

67
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.160
uh,

68
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.993
later on.

69
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.391
Uh,

70
00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:46.890
and the fact that Germany,

71
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.750
German unification was achieved by pressure and that pressure was dominated by

72
00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:53.610
nobles who were called [inaudible].

73
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.200
You'll come to them later,

74
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.830
uh,

75
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.030
and by an army,

76
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.690
uh,

77
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.020
which in which the state basically was an appendage of the army,

78
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.540
had rather enormous consequences for,

79
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.573
for Europe,

80
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.370
uh,

81
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.280
in the late 19th and above all in the,

82
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.690
in the 20th century.

83
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.590
Uh,

84
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.470
so in the 1960 to 1970s,

85
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.000
people paid a lot more attention to social structure,

86
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.960
uh,

87
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.441
and,

88
00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:16.921
and,

89
00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:17.220
uh,

90
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.371
you know,

91
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:18.720
sort of class analysis.

92
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.901
But,

93
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:19.231
but you know,

94
00:02:19.231 --> 00:02:20.250
when you look at Britain,

95
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.701
uh,

96
00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:22.430
experience of Britain and,

97
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.650
uh,

98
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.580
the Dutch republic,

99
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:25.590
they do share things that,

100
00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:25.861
that,

101
00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:26.221
that,

102
00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:26.640
uh,

103
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.761
uh,

104
00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:30.870
in a way determine the kind of of political economy,

105
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.320
uh,

106
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.790
that they would have.

107
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.530
So what,

108
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.691
you know,

109
00:02:33.691 --> 00:02:36.450
what are some of these things that I've written up on the board,

110
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.940
uh,

111
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:37.210
uh,

112
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.830
there,

113
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.860
but let's just start a not necessarily a,

114
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.051
well,

115
00:02:40.051 --> 00:02:40.540
I guess,

116
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.190
uh,

117
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.730
yeah,

118
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.311
I guess in the,

119
00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:44.190
in that order and just kind of think aloud.

120
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:47.880
And then when I'm going to do the last 20 or 25 minutes is talk about the Dutch

121
00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:48.601
republic.

122
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:50.580
And so you could skip that part in the reading,

123
00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:51.540
which isn't very long.

124
00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:52.021
And again,

125
00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:52.860
illustrate,

126
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.670
uh,

127
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.930
with some paintings that you,

128
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:56.130
for what you're not responsible,

129
00:02:56.131 --> 00:03:00.550
but just to make the points I want to make about the nature of the Dutch

130
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:02.620
republic in which we'll see,

131
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.450
you'll see in ways in which it was very similar to England slash Great Britain

132
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.560
and very different,

133
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.220
uh,

134
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.660
in terms of,

135
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.440
of,

136
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.691
uh,

137
00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:12.524
of France.

138
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.090
Uh,

139
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.440
so first of all,

140
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.250
um,

141
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.510
it's not a coincidence that in both England and in the Dutch republic,

142
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:20.290
you had,

143
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.770
uh,

144
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:21.011
uh,

145
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:22.780
along with northern Italy,

146
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:24.040
the city states in northern Italy,

147
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:25.530
you had the largest percentage of the,

148
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.880
uh,

149
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.090
of,

150
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.770
of middle class population that you could find in Europe of that,

151
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:30.581
in if the,

152
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:31.780
if the middleclass in,

153
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:32.200
in,

154
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.040
in Russia,

155
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.400
I,

156
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.600
which I'll talk about on Monday,

157
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:36.340
was just absolutely minuscule.

158
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.420
Uh,

159
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.631
the,

160
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:37.841
the,

161
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:40.050
the middleclass was extremely small in,

162
00:03:40.051 --> 00:03:40.960
in Prussia.

163
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.670
A pressure did not include,

164
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.970
you know,

165
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.250
the Hanseatic League cities such as,

166
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.880
uh,

167
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.671
it's a Braman and,

168
00:03:46.671 --> 00:03:46.891
and,

169
00:03:46.891 --> 00:03:47.061
and,

170
00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:48.050
and humble and,

171
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.600
and the others.

172
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.200
Uh,

173
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.510
so you have in,

174
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.560
in the Netherlands and,

175
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.800
uh,

176
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.350
in England and astonishingly large,

177
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.120
uh,

178
00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.230
uh,

179
00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.680
middleclass morever.

180
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.480
Moreover,

181
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.950
uh,

182
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:01.320
in,

183
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.830
in the case of England,

184
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.350
uh,

185
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.330
there was a tremendous fluidity between elites.

186
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.960
A,

187
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.540
that's a percentage of the population who was noble,

188
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.291
uh,

189
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:13.090
who had noble titles,

190
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.860
was extremely small.

191
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.790
Uh,

192
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:16.330
uh,

193
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.170
privilege,

194
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.800
uh,

195
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.230
came from wealth and wealth was,

196
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.010
uh,

197
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.520
uh,

198
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.520
stem from the land yet because of the rapid and dramatic expansion of the

199
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:30.910
English role in the global economy,

200
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.600
uh,

201
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.600
you had lots of very wealthy landlord or landlord's property owners investing in

202
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.100
commerce.

203
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.510
Uh,

204
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.050
whereas in a,

205
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:41.920
in Spain,

206
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.521
uh,

207
00:04:42.521 --> 00:04:43.331
and in,

208
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:44.860
in France and in Prussia,

209
00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:45.790
in particularly,

210
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:46.271
it was,

211
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:47.150
seemed to be sort of,

212
00:04:47.151 --> 00:04:47.560
uh,

213
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.220
uh,

214
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.581
uh,

215
00:04:48.581 --> 00:04:49.420
slumming,

216
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.750
uh,

217
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:50.440
for,

218
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.900
uh,

219
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.990
nobles to participate in commerce.

220
00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:53.590
Now that,

221
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.890
you know,

222
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.820
Marxist analysis has given us this,

223
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.040
this is all too rigid,

224
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.203
uh,

225
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.600
a picture of the nobility sort of letting their nails grow long.

226
00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:01.731
And,

227
00:05:01.731 --> 00:05:02.170
and,

228
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.290
uh,

229
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.420
they are nobles because they do nothing.

230
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:05.260
That was part of it.

231
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.090
Certainly there were nobles and France and,

232
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.421
uh,

233
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:08.630
who bought up vineyards in,

234
00:05:08.631 --> 00:05:08.921
in,

235
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:09.221
in,

236
00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:09.610
uh,

237
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.640
around Boldo or they're nobles or into lose hoo,

238
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.410
hoo around to lose who have great,

239
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:15.100
uh,

240
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.930
invest in commercial agriculture.

241
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.610
But yet the fact remains that it's really in England,

242
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:22.570
uh,

243
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.010
that you have this tremendous fluidity between within the elite,

244
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.820
uh,

245
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.660
and that,

246
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.200
uh,

247
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.590
you know,

248
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.660
basically commercial money talks,

249
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.320
uh,

250
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.800
uh,

251
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.910
as much as propertied monied talks,

252
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.600
um,

253
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.433
London,

254
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.350
I already by the late 16th century one,

255
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:42.790
sixth of all the people,

256
00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:43.970
I think this is a Tony Wrigley,

257
00:05:43.971 --> 00:05:46.300
a Ea Wrigley who pointed this out long time ago.

258
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.110
One sixth of all the people in England went to London frequently,

259
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.243
frequently,

260
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.000
well,

261
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.870
whereas this would,

262
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.390
this would because of London was absolutely gigantic,

263
00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:56.921
has a city,

264
00:05:56.921 --> 00:05:59.480
the only cities in Europe that were comparable and they were smaller,

265
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:00.650
where Naples,

266
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.930
extraordinarily poor a city and,

267
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:03.291
and,

268
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:03.530
uh,

269
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.341
Constantinople,

270
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:05.174
Istanbul.

271
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.900
Uh,

272
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.310
and of course in Japan,

273
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.263
Eto,

274
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.500
which would become,

275
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.190
uh,

276
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.690
known as Tokyo.

277
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.560
And so the percentage of the English population that would have considered

278
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:16.394
themselves to be,

279
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.750
you know,

280
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.500
middleclass is extraordinarily large.

281
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.891
Now,

282
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:22.250
the same is even more true in the Netherlands.

283
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.850
Uh,

284
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.680
their work to be sure nobles in the Netherlands are,

285
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.250
they tend to deliver in the eastern part and rural,

286
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.910
uh,

287
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:29.031
uh,

288
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:29.860
Netherlands,

289
00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.170
uh,

290
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.400
and in the south.

291
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.970
Uh,

292
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.310
but their lives and their interests were far,

293
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:37.220
far away from the day from that economic,

294
00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.910
uh,

295
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:38.510
uh,

296
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.343
uh,

297
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.610
large machine,

298
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.200
which was Amsterdam and Amsterdam is dominated by the middle classes.

299
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.050
Now the middleclass want political rights.

300
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:48.980
They want prerogatives.

301
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:50.690
They want their privileges for themselves.

302
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.350
Uh,

303
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.040
and uh,

304
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.640
certainly,

305
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.080
uh,

306
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.260
it,

307
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.100
it is fair to,

308
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.560
to,

309
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.130
to argue that that non titled People in England,

310
00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.640
uh,

311
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.510
we're at the forefront of the victorious,

312
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.200
uh,

313
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.150
um,

314
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.920
role in the civil war of that parliament,

315
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:07.340
uh,

316
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.390
played now,

317
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:08.621
uh,

318
00:07:08.621 --> 00:07:08.991
in,

319
00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:09.980
in the city states of,

320
00:07:09.981 --> 00:07:10.271
of,

321
00:07:10.271 --> 00:07:10.501
of,

322
00:07:10.501 --> 00:07:11.470
of Venice and,

323
00:07:11.471 --> 00:07:12.020
and of,

324
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:12.470
uh,

325
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.500
which was a major trading city already on the decline.

326
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.400
And in Florence and in Milan and in Turin and places like that,

327
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.000
uh,

328
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.190
you,

329
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.650
you find something very comparable,

330
00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:21.831
but,

331
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:22.521
but these are the,

332
00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:25.010
Italy is not United until the 1860s.

333
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:25.760
Uh,

334
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.530
so northern Italy has a,

335
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:27.980
uh,

336
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:28.491
has a,

337
00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:30.330
a large percentage of the population who are,

338
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:30.650
are,

339
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.580
are middle class.

340
00:07:31.581 --> 00:07:31.791
But,

341
00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:33.640
but in talking about the political outcomes of,

342
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:34.723
of states,

343
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.300
uh,

344
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:35.780
that's,

345
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.340
uh,

346
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:36.620
uh,

347
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.420
it doesn't really fit into our analysis here.

348
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.410
Um,

349
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:39.890
now,

350
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.580
part of that is that along with northern Italy,

351
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:44.240
uh,

352
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.800
the Netherlands and,

353
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:46.380
uh,

354
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:46.651
and,

355
00:07:46.651 --> 00:07:49.490
and England slash Great Britain have,

356
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.110
uh,

357
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:50.240
uh,

358
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.850
by far the most urbanized population,

359
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:53.391
uh,

360
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:54.140
in,

361
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:54.411
uh,

362
00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:55.244
in Europe,

363
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.730
uh,

364
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.110
that if you go into Serbia,

365
00:07:57.111 --> 00:07:57.651
for example,

366
00:07:57.651 --> 00:07:58.530
what now is Serbia.

367
00:07:58.531 --> 00:07:58.761
I mean,

368
00:07:58.761 --> 00:07:59.161
they're basically,

369
00:07:59.161 --> 00:07:59.961
it was Belgrade,

370
00:07:59.961 --> 00:08:01.190
which was a small place.

371
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:01.940
Uh,

372
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.740
Poland had a very lively,

373
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:04.790
important cities,

374
00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:05.370
uh,

375
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:05.790
uh,

376
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:06.290
uh,

377
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:06.960
uh,

378
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.690
Warsaw and Krakow,

379
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.350
uh,

380
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.510
and some of Gdansk as well.

381
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.410
Uh,

382
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:12.651
uh,

383
00:08:12.651 --> 00:08:13.730
so you can't just say,

384
00:08:13.731 --> 00:08:14.031
well,

385
00:08:14.031 --> 00:08:15.650
in eastern Europe there weren't cities,

386
00:08:15.651 --> 00:08:16.730
but there isn't any place,

387
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:17.420
uh,

388
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.440
including France,

389
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:19.010
uh,

390
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:23.570
that had a remotely as high as percentage of the population living in cities,

391
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.140
uh,

392
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:24.740
as,

393
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:25.160
uh,

394
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:25.993
England,

395
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.271
uh,

396
00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:26.810
and,

397
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:27.680
and the Netherlands.

398
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.820
And one of the great shifts in English history,

399
00:08:29.821 --> 00:08:30.080
English,

400
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.100
British history that you,

401
00:08:31.101 --> 00:08:31.790
that you,

402
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:32.180
you know,

403
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.200
become aware,

404
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:33.710
uh,

405
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.430
is the shift of economic dynamism in England,

406
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.010
a way from the south to the north.

407
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:40.760
Uh,

408
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.250
in the time we're starting this course in the 17th century,

409
00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:44.061
besides London,

410
00:08:44.061 --> 00:08:45.530
which is this gigantic place,

411
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:46.100
uh,

412
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.210
the biggest cities in England where we're at Norwich and Exeter and then York,

413
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:50.550
uh,

414
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:51.351
in the north.

415
00:08:51.351 --> 00:08:54.170
And of course with a large scale industrialization,

416
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.780
which begins I in the middle of the 18th century,

417
00:08:57.781 --> 00:08:57.961
you,

418
00:08:57.961 --> 00:09:00.450
you'll see this dramatic shift up to the north.

419
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:00.991
And then of course,

420
00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:01.501
Manchester,

421
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:02.430
which was a small town,

422
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:03.061
becomes this,

423
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:03.590
uh,

424
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.960
uh,

425
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.570
enormous city in Liverpool becomes ever more important.

426
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:07.410
Um,

427
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:08.060
but you know,

428
00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.290
cities that are or were in the middle class lives and,

429
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:11.400
and bourgeois,

430
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.120
you know,

431
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:12.931
and Burgers,

432
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:14.430
as I said last time come from,

433
00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:14.670
you know,

434
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.130
these are urban residents who,

435
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:16.770
who,

436
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.460
who were losing their privileges on the continent to big time absolute states.

437
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.210
Uh,

438
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:21.840
and,

439
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.350
uh,

440
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:26.730
they will defend quite vociferously their privileges as,

441
00:09:26.731 --> 00:09:31.731
as the town's people against a pretentions absolutist pretentions of,

442
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:33.601
of,

443
00:09:33.601 --> 00:09:34.590
of nobles in the,

444
00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:35.281
in the case of,

445
00:09:35.281 --> 00:09:36.360
of the Netherlands.

446
00:09:36.361 --> 00:09:39.120
And also to an extent in England as well.

447
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.190
So they share those things in common,

448
00:09:41.191 --> 00:09:44.590
which is not to say that a country like France wasn't a with an urbanized,

449
00:09:44.591 --> 00:09:47.190
because France is Paris is already enormous,

450
00:09:47.191 --> 00:09:48.720
or 500,000 people about it.

451
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:50.820
The time of the French revolution,

452
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:51.151
I,

453
00:09:51.151 --> 00:09:53.430
there's so many people you can't count because they own nothing.

454
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.960
And also we don't have really accurate censuses until the 19th century.

455
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.380
The first accurate census I think is in Copenhagen,

456
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.870
uh,

457
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:02.671
in the end of the,

458
00:10:02.671 --> 00:10:03.990
of the 18th century.

459
00:10:03.991 --> 00:10:06.420
And most censuses were taken by the way,

460
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.010
as a way of counting heads,

461
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:08.380
uh,

462
00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.400
the number of people who had to be fed at the time of a siege.

463
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.041
So we were,

464
00:10:12.041 --> 00:10:12.910
we're kind of guessing on,

465
00:10:12.911 --> 00:10:13.091
on,

466
00:10:13.091 --> 00:10:14.520
on these population figures.

467
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.210
Uh,

468
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:15.691
but,

469
00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:16.140
uh,

470
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:16.980
um,

471
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.700
the fact remains that that the Netherlands and England,

472
00:10:20.701 --> 00:10:21.390
Britain,

473
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:21.541
uh,

474
00:10:21.541 --> 00:10:22.360
share,

475
00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:22.710
uh,

476
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:23.690
this and this,

477
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.280
this is important in terms of,

478
00:10:25.281 --> 00:10:28.120
of a political outcomes and also important in,

479
00:10:28.121 --> 00:10:28.861
in the case of England,

480
00:10:28.861 --> 00:10:29.430
Britain,

481
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.641
uh,

482
00:10:29.641 --> 00:10:30.270
in,

483
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:30.750
uh,

484
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:30.961
uh,

485
00:10:30.961 --> 00:10:34.080
what we've come to call the industrial revolution,

486
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.160
which I will talk about,

487
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.680
uh,

488
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:35.970
uh,

489
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.260
talk about at another time.

490
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:37.980
Um,

491
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:38.701
secondly,

492
00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:40.140
as I tried to suggest the other day,

493
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:40.710
uh,

494
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:41.191
that,

495
00:10:41.191 --> 00:10:41.550
uh,

496
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:41.731
you know,

497
00:10:41.731 --> 00:10:42.710
these places Resu,

498
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.520
uh,

499
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:43.791
uh,

500
00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:44.230
they,

501
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:45.540
they resist absolutism,

502
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:46.381
uh,

503
00:10:46.381 --> 00:10:48.120
that the English civil war,

504
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:48.530
it's,

505
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:49.800
it's kind of a generalization to,

506
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.190
uh,

507
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:50.761
to make that,

508
00:10:50.761 --> 00:10:50.851
to,

509
00:10:50.851 --> 00:10:51.000
to,

510
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.200
to underline that too much,

511
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:52.351
but,

512
00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:53.080
but nonetheless,

513
00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:53.540
the,

514
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:53.880
uh,

515
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.510
people,

516
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.290
uh,

517
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:56.150
living in,

518
00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:56.291
uh,

519
00:10:56.291 --> 00:10:58.080
in England in the 1640s,

520
00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:58.700
uh,

521
00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:58.980
uh,

522
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.960
saw that there was a real threat to,

523
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.470
uh,

524
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.870
the idea of the free born Englishman,

525
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.171
uh,

526
00:11:04.171 --> 00:11:05.370
that was coming from,

527
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:05.940
uh,

528
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:06.360
uh,

529
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.800
from the trampling of,

530
00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:08.550
of,

531
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.881
of,

532
00:11:08.881 --> 00:11:12.270
of long assumed rights since at least the 13th century,

533
00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:13.710
at least in the imagination,

534
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:14.520
uh,

535
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:14.941
of,

536
00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:15.290
uh,

537
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:15.470
uh,

538
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:16.350
of people,

539
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:16.831
uh,

540
00:11:16.831 --> 00:11:17.540
by,

541
00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:17.800
uh,

542
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.001
uh,

543
00:11:18.001 --> 00:11:20.310
by kings who wanted to dispense with,

544
00:11:20.311 --> 00:11:24.000
with the rights of parliament and run things as,

545
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:24.670
uh,

546
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:26.340
as they wanted to.

547
00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:27.150
Um,

548
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.580
and in the case of,

549
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.700
of the Netherlands,

550
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:30.600
it's the same thing.

551
00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:30.951
I mean the,

552
00:11:30.951 --> 00:11:31.430
the,

553
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.910
uh,

554
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.590
there isn't anything as dramatic as the English civil war,

555
00:11:34.591 --> 00:11:37.800
but the important kind of outcome is that in the end,

556
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.100
this decentralized federalist structure,

557
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.100
which I described in the book and we'll talk a little bit about in a while,

558
00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:44.880
uh,

559
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:45.210
uh,

560
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:50.210
is victorious over the pretensions of a potential dynastic ruling house that is

561
00:11:50.521 --> 00:11:51.990
the Orange House,

562
00:11:51.991 --> 00:11:53.250
the house of Orange,

563
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:53.920
uh,

564
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.190
who would want it to make the chief Dutch official,

565
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:58.940
it was called the stockholder holder.

566
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.220
You can you read that in,

567
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:01.400
uh,

568
00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:01.590
uh,

569
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:06.590
in the book and wanted to turn that person into kind of a sundering,

570
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:07.090
uh,

571
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.830
semi absolutist monarch.

572
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.600
And that doesn't work as well.

573
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.410
Uh,

574
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.230
and when you think of the origins of the Netherlands,

575
00:12:14.231 --> 00:12:18.070
the origins of the Netherlands comes from a civil war,

576
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:23.071
a war or a war of independence against the Spanish absolute to state.

577
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:28.650
That begins in when 1572 and goes on and off all the time until Dutch

578
00:12:28.841 --> 00:12:29.531
independence.

579
00:12:29.531 --> 00:12:30.850
It's a recognized,

580
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:32.830
it was a fet to complete for a long time,

581
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:37.980
but until the Dutch independence was recognized in 1648 at the Treaty of

582
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:39.460
Westphalia.

583
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:40.810
So for the Dutch,

584
00:12:40.811 --> 00:12:41.860
when they imagine,

585
00:12:41.861 --> 00:12:42.041
you know,

586
00:12:42.041 --> 00:12:43.480
scary things,

587
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.480
a scary thing as an army sent by,

588
00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:46.940
uh,

589
00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:47.470
uh,

590
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:47.700
uh,

591
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.430
sent by,

592
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:49.240
uh,

593
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.620
the King of Spain,

594
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.160
uh,

595
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:56.160
to extract more taxes from the wealthiest of all the Spanish pro,

596
00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.580
uh,

597
00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:01.720
provinces that is the Netherlands rich because of commerce.

598
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:03.160
And as we'll see in a minute,

599
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:08.340
to try to force people to remain Catholics at a time when the vast majority of

600
00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:12.430
the Dutch population had converted to Calvinism.

601
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:14.190
And so the,

602
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.610
in the,

603
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:14.791
the,

604
00:13:14.791 --> 00:13:15.110
the,

605
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.341
the,

606
00:13:15.341 --> 00:13:17.290
those people who believed in the Dutch republic,

607
00:13:17.291 --> 00:13:19.030
which is the vast majority of the people,

608
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:19.930
uh,

609
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:20.231
uh,

610
00:13:20.231 --> 00:13:21.220
just as people,

611
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:25.120
the majority of the population of England who held to the rights of parliament,

612
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.890
they have this sort of scary scenario of their rights being violated,

613
00:13:29.891 --> 00:13:30.820
trampled upon,

614
00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:31.751
destroyed,

615
00:13:31.751 --> 00:13:32.231
eliminated,

616
00:13:32.231 --> 00:13:35.830
or eradicated by big time absolute rulers.

617
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.500
And the other scary thing for the Dutch is of course,

618
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:40.930
if the big guy down south,

619
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:41.680
uh,

620
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.350
because,

621
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.770
uh,

622
00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:43.390
uh,

623
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:43.691
Louis,

624
00:13:43.691 --> 00:13:46.000
the 14th would love to control all of,

625
00:13:46.001 --> 00:13:46.271
of,

626
00:13:46.271 --> 00:13:50.680
of the Netherlands and his invasions w at one time or turned by back when they

627
00:13:50.681 --> 00:13:51.880
literally opened the dikes.

628
00:13:51.881 --> 00:13:53.980
And flood the French armies back.

629
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:55.030
And so,

630
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.271
you know,

631
00:13:55.271 --> 00:13:55.511
in,

632
00:13:55.511 --> 00:13:55.871
in the,

633
00:13:55.871 --> 00:13:56.081
the,

634
00:13:56.081 --> 00:13:56.680
the,

635
00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:56.951
the,

636
00:13:56.951 --> 00:14:01.150
the mental construction of the Dutch and the English both involves one thing

637
00:14:01.151 --> 00:14:02.170
they don't want to be,

638
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:04.150
and that is to lose their progressives,

639
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.250
the rights to an absolute state.

640
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.200
And in both cases,

641
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:11.380
this becomes part of their self identity.

642
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:15.250
That's an essential part is my good friend Linda colony and used to teach here

643
00:14:15.251 --> 00:14:16.120
and sadly is no,

644
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:16.901
not here anymore.

645
00:14:16.901 --> 00:14:17.734
She's at Princeton,

646
00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:18.191
uh,

647
00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:19.630
that she made in her argument,

648
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.400
uh,

649
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:20.640
uh,

650
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.030
made an argument in her very successful book called Britain's the construction

651
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:26.740
of British identity.

652
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:27.430
Uh,

653
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:30.430
and I will argue later in the course in 1848,

654
00:14:30.431 --> 00:14:35.431
it has to get reinvented again by imagining and the other who is perceived as

655
00:14:36.731 --> 00:14:38.140
sneaky and dangerous.

656
00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:38.891
And of course,

657
00:14:38.891 --> 00:14:39.910
in that case is the French,

658
00:14:39.911 --> 00:14:42.070
but also point of view of the British,

659
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.520
the Irish who were conceived of this perceived,

660
00:14:45.521 --> 00:14:49.960
of as being capable because of their quest for Macron and be trampled by the,

661
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.760
by the English definitely by English Protestants,

662
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.480
ah,

663
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.370
of hooking up with,

664
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:56.150
uh,

665
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.871
with France,

666
00:14:56.871 --> 00:14:58.820
which they tried to do in 1798,

667
00:14:59.060 --> 00:14:59.570
uh,

668
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.840
or in the world war one with Germany.

669
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:03.530
Uh,

670
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.240
because there were some attempts of the Germans to,

671
00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:07.790
to a stoke up Irish independence movements.

672
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:08.661
So again,

673
00:15:08.661 --> 00:15:12.110
the only point here is that they see themselves as abs anti absolute test,

674
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.120
and this helps them create this,

675
00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:15.230
this sense of identity,

676
00:15:15.231 --> 00:15:17.030
which helps determine their political,

677
00:15:17.031 --> 00:15:17.540
uh,

678
00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:18.050
uh,

679
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.160
their political origins.

680
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.290
And you'll find nothing comparable in,

681
00:15:21.291 --> 00:15:21.831
in Russia,

682
00:15:21.831 --> 00:15:22.191
obviously,

683
00:15:22.191 --> 00:15:23.230
which we'll come back and talk about.

684
00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:24.083
We're in Prussia,

685
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:24.560
uh,

686
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.221
or in France,

687
00:15:25.221 --> 00:15:27.820
you can talk about the origins of French nationalism in the middle of the,

688
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:29.510
of the 18th century,

689
00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:34.511
but it's very closely tied to this dynasty at least until they lop off the guy's

690
00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:35.420
head,

691
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:35.691
you know,

692
00:15:35.691 --> 00:15:37.250
in 1793.

693
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:38.060
Uh,

694
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:38.451
so,

695
00:15:38.451 --> 00:15:38.691
okay.

696
00:15:38.691 --> 00:15:39.650
So that's sort of that,

697
00:15:39.651 --> 00:15:40.484
that point.

698
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.353
Um,

699
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.070
cern is

700
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:45.920
decentralization,

701
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:46.710
uh,

702
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:51.140
is that both of these states are decentralized states.

703
00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.830
The British don't have a police force until one 18,

704
00:15:54.831 --> 00:15:56.120
27 or 29.

705
00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:56.954
I can't remember which,

706
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.810
when Robert Peale creates an London police force,

707
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.400
which they call the bobbies after,

708
00:16:01.401 --> 00:16:01.551
you know,

709
00:16:01.551 --> 00:16:02.061
like Robert,

710
00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:02.421
Bob,

711
00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:03.220
Bobby's,

712
00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:03.650
uh,

713
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:04.700
and people didn't want that.

714
00:16:04.701 --> 00:16:06.290
They didn't want a large standing army.

715
00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:08.720
What are the identified large standing armies with?

716
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:11.480
They always had to have a lord standing navy for obvious reasons,

717
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:16.780
but they identified large standing armies with France or with,

718
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:17.540
uh,

719
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:22.540
the Spain of Phillip the second or with pressure or with Russia.

720
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.350
And so it didn't mean that the English state wasn't efficient in collecting

721
00:16:27.351 --> 00:16:30.920
taxes cause they were more efficient than the French were in collecting taxes.

722
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:32.190
But it does mean that,

723
00:16:32.191 --> 00:16:37.191
that this decentralization is an essential part of who they thought they were.

724
00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:37.970
Uh,

725
00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:38.870
that the sheriff,

726
00:16:38.871 --> 00:16:39.890
the local sheriff,

727
00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:40.221
you know,

728
00:16:40.221 --> 00:16:40.401
he'll,

729
00:16:40.401 --> 00:16:42.950
he'll call up the guys and the restore order when,

730
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:43.191
uh,

731
00:16:43.191 --> 00:16:44.150
when there's trouble,

732
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.140
but there's this real kind of a,

733
00:16:46.141 --> 00:16:47.150
of fear that,

734
00:16:47.151 --> 00:16:49.790
that the standing lord standing armies are,

735
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:50.690
uh,

736
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:54.770
it could ultimately compromise the rights of free born Englishman.

737
00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:59.630
And that's in a way that they would have put it in the case of the Netherlands,

738
00:16:59.631 --> 00:17:01.080
which I'll come back to in a while.

739
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:03.180
You have these provinces that,

740
00:17:03.181 --> 00:17:04.700
that although Amsterdam though,

741
00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:04.971
you know,

742
00:17:04.971 --> 00:17:05.571
Holland,

743
00:17:05.571 --> 00:17:07.190
which is the province of Amsterdam,

744
00:17:07.191 --> 00:17:09.470
is by far the most important of the,

745
00:17:09.471 --> 00:17:10.090
of the pro,

746
00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:10.201
uh,

747
00:17:10.201 --> 00:17:11.350
and most prosperous of,

748
00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.020
of the,

749
00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:12.853
of the Dutch,

750
00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:13.360
uh,

751
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:13.540
uh,

752
00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:17.660
provinces such as that we often miss call the Netherlands Holland when in fact

753
00:17:17.661 --> 00:17:18.830
Holland is just one of the,

754
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:19.610
uh,

755
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:22.490
one of the provinces is if you call it the United States in New York or

756
00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:23.324
California,

757
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.520
because those are the two most powerful states in,

758
00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:27.050
uh,

759
00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:27.351
uh,

760
00:17:27.351 --> 00:17:28.580
in the United States.

761
00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:29.120
Uh,

762
00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:33.740
but the sort of decentralized federalist structure is part of who they thought

763
00:17:33.741 --> 00:17:36.650
they were and who they continue to think they are.

764
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:37.550
Um,

765
00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.760
and this is very different than uh,

766
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:40.101
uh,

767
00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:40.670
then,

768
00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:41.330
uh,

769
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:41.961
uh,

770
00:17:41.961 --> 00:17:44.570
then these absolute kings who can send out their,

771
00:17:44.571 --> 00:17:45.140
their,

772
00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:45.291
uh,

773
00:17:45.291 --> 00:17:49.070
their armies can run by their minions to squish whomever they want.

774
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.040
Grapes,

775
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.000
whenever there's trouble.

776
00:17:51.001 --> 00:17:52.890
And we can exaggerate the power of Phillip.

777
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:53.311
I mean,

778
00:17:53.311 --> 00:17:54.130
of a Peter,

779
00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:58.470
the grade became this vast empire that's expanding south and already expanding

780
00:17:58.471 --> 00:18:00.770
towards Siberia and such just in places.

781
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:01.980
It took a long time to get the,

782
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:02.551
get the,

783
00:18:02.551 --> 00:18:02.731
the,

784
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:03.481
the guys there.

785
00:18:03.481 --> 00:18:04.291
But when they got there,

786
00:18:04.291 --> 00:18:06.300
there was hell to pay a very,

787
00:18:06.301 --> 00:18:07.170
very different than this,

788
00:18:07.171 --> 00:18:11.910
this federalist structure of a decentralized structure of a,

789
00:18:11.911 --> 00:18:13.050
of both of these countries.

790
00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:14.210
And the political outcome is to,

791
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:14.701
is different.

792
00:18:14.701 --> 00:18:14.761
Now,

793
00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:15.780
you can also make that argument.

794
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:15.990
We don't,

795
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:17.190
this isn't the course to do that,

796
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.550
but you can make that argument about the United States and the,

797
00:18:20.551 --> 00:18:20.791
of course,

798
00:18:20.791 --> 00:18:22.590
the evolution of the United States when they,

799
00:18:22.591 --> 00:18:23.280
when they,

800
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:23.610
uh,

801
00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:24.181
because of the,

802
00:18:24.181 --> 00:18:24.580
of the,

803
00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:25.650
the local,

804
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:26.850
the local,

805
00:18:26.851 --> 00:18:30.900
a prestige of local leaders and the decentralized notion that nature of the

806
00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.630
colonies already at the time of the war of independence,

807
00:18:33.631 --> 00:18:34.650
which we're going to have a strong,

808
00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.630
a strong,

809
00:18:36.631 --> 00:18:38.900
a role in the political outcome for better,

810
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:39.743
for worse,

811
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:40.200
uh,

812
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.290
in this country where you have this or a Wacko political systems to,

813
00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.760
there's still exist because of,

814
00:18:44.761 --> 00:18:44.970
you know,

815
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:46.680
people screaming states rights and all that.

816
00:18:46.681 --> 00:18:47.280
But that's,

817
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.113
that's another,

818
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.140
that's another subject.

819
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:50.243
Um,

820
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:50.611
okay.

821
00:18:50.611 --> 00:18:51.420
Fourth,

822
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:51.661
you know,

823
00:18:51.661 --> 00:18:52.260
antiques,

824
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.280
Catholicism,

825
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:54.180
uh,

826
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.500
in both cases,

827
00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:56.453
why,

828
00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:57.030
uh,

829
00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:57.241
well,

830
00:18:57.241 --> 00:18:57.900
because these are,

831
00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.800
these are major,

832
00:18:58.801 --> 00:18:59.940
major countries in,

833
00:18:59.941 --> 00:19:00.101
in,

834
00:19:00.101 --> 00:19:00.321
in,

835
00:19:00.321 --> 00:19:01.154
in the reformation,

836
00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:02.280
uh,

837
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:02.820
that the,

838
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.001
you know,

839
00:19:03.001 --> 00:19:04.020
the English reformation,

840
00:19:04.021 --> 00:19:06.350
which would be getting begins with Henry Henry the eighth,

841
00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:06.691
you know,

842
00:19:06.691 --> 00:19:07.230
uh,

843
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.340
wanting to divorce is very,

844
00:19:08.341 --> 00:19:09.870
and kill his various wives.

845
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:10.590
Uh,

846
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:10.890
you know,

847
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:11.760
along the way,

848
00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:15.180
I still had an awful lot to do with resistance to the power of Rome.

849
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:15.840
Uh,

850
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.231
and the,

851
00:19:16.231 --> 00:19:17.160
the power of,

852
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:21.960
of the Catholic Church as an institution in the case of the Netherlands,

853
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:22.620
uh,

854
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.320
anti Catholicism is endemic.

855
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:25.741
Why?

856
00:19:25.741 --> 00:19:26.990
Because it's identified with,

857
00:19:26.991 --> 00:19:28.380
with the Spanish empire,

858
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:29.341
with Spain,

859
00:19:29.341 --> 00:19:32.850
which not only wanting to extract taxes and other revenue from its most

860
00:19:32.851 --> 00:19:34.020
prosperous province.

861
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:35.640
I been wanted to force people,

862
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:36.180
uh,

863
00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:36.720
to,

864
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:36.841
uh,

865
00:19:36.841 --> 00:19:37.710
remain Catholic.

866
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.830
And when they send this guy called the Duke of Alba Up to,

867
00:19:40.831 --> 00:19:41.370
uh,

868
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:41.731
uh,

869
00:19:41.731 --> 00:19:42.600
up to the Netherlands,

870
00:19:42.601 --> 00:19:42.811
I mean,

871
00:19:42.811 --> 00:19:43.011
he,

872
00:19:43.011 --> 00:19:43.141
you know,

873
00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:45.240
Burns people to the steak and all this kind of stuff.

874
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:45.960
Uh,

875
00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:46.793
and so,

876
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:47.191
uh,

877
00:19:47.191 --> 00:19:49.240
and the Association of,

878
00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.640
of Catholicism as the dominant religion in,

879
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:51.240
uh,

880
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:51.931
in both of the,

881
00:19:51.931 --> 00:19:54.180
the enemy countries that is France and,

882
00:19:54.181 --> 00:19:54.690
uh,

883
00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:55.280
um,

884
00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:55.370
uh,

885
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:56.203
and Spain,

886
00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:56.521
uh,

887
00:19:56.521 --> 00:19:57.960
is extremely important.

888
00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:58.171
Now,

889
00:19:58.171 --> 00:20:02.160
this is not to say that the Dutch don't fight the English too because they do

890
00:20:02.161 --> 00:20:03.330
their various wars over,

891
00:20:03.331 --> 00:20:03.960
over,

892
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.141
you know,

893
00:20:04.141 --> 00:20:05.280
control of the seas.

894
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:06.330
But nonetheless,

895
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:06.930
in,

896
00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:07.171
uh,

897
00:20:07.171 --> 00:20:09.840
in the imagination of both of these are in the,

898
00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:10.650
in the metal,

899
00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:11.100
uh,

900
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.550
measuring antibody in the mental sort of construction of these,

901
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.090
uh,

902
00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.140
of these two countries.

903
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.810
What we are not that is Catholic,

904
00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:19.380
uh,

905
00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.130
helps,

906
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:20.370
uh,

907
00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.230
helps define their identity.

908
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:22.681
Of course,

909
00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:26.490
a particular problem of Ireland or challenge of Ireland as I suggested earlier.

910
00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:30.120
It has an awful lot to do with that and the reinvention in the 19th century of

911
00:20:30.121 --> 00:20:30.871
British identity.

912
00:20:30.871 --> 00:20:32.850
We also have a lot to do with fear of the Irish,

913
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:33.271
you know,

914
00:20:33.271 --> 00:20:35.040
the enemy within as they were perceived.

915
00:20:35.041 --> 00:20:35.611
But more about that.

916
00:20:35.611 --> 00:20:39.090
I'll talk about that a lot a lot and try to explain why there was no revolution

917
00:20:39.091 --> 00:20:39.924
in England,

918
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:40.350
uh,

919
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:41.220
in 18,

920
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:41.551
uh,

921
00:20:41.551 --> 00:20:42.510
in 1848.

922
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.201
And then of course,

923
00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:43.351
of,

924
00:20:43.351 --> 00:20:43.681
of,

925
00:20:43.681 --> 00:20:44.290
uh,

926
00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:44.580
uh,

927
00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.181
in the course of,

928
00:20:45.181 --> 00:20:45.430
of,

929
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.661
of,

930
00:20:45.661 --> 00:20:45.901
of,

931
00:20:45.901 --> 00:20:46.471
of Britain,

932
00:20:46.471 --> 00:20:48.700
it's even clearer because the French is,

933
00:20:48.701 --> 00:20:48.971
is,

934
00:20:48.971 --> 00:20:49.300
is,

935
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:49.660
uh,

936
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:49.841
you know,

937
00:20:49.841 --> 00:20:51.130
this Niki French,

938
00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:51.760
uh,

939
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.210
and,

940
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:53.020
and from the British,

941
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.260
the French point of view with the perfidious Albion already there.

942
00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.190
And if you know,

943
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:58.360
you can go all the way,

944
00:20:58.361 --> 00:20:58.770
uh,

945
00:20:58.770 --> 00:20:58.931
you know,

946
00:20:58.931 --> 00:21:00.490
up to the origins of World War One,

947
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.950
uh,

948
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:01.330
uh,

949
00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:01.841
to see,

950
00:21:01.841 --> 00:21:01.951
uh,

951
00:21:01.951 --> 00:21:05.860
I mean when the British to get into world war one is because of the violation

952
00:21:05.861 --> 00:21:05.981
of,

953
00:21:05.981 --> 00:21:06.281
of,

954
00:21:06.281 --> 00:21:06.760
uh,

955
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.310
of Belgian neutrality by the Germans because the idea of having another enemy,

956
00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:13.150
you've already got the French across the channel and it's not that big a

957
00:21:13.151 --> 00:21:13.511
channel.

958
00:21:13.511 --> 00:21:14.650
You could swim across it.

959
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:15.311
Uh,

960
00:21:15.311 --> 00:21:15.761
I couldn't,

961
00:21:15.761 --> 00:21:15.941
but,

962
00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:16.631
and you couldn't either,

963
00:21:16.631 --> 00:21:18.610
but as people have and do it all the time.

964
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:22.120
But if you've got the Germans in Austan eating mood fleet,

965
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.720
uh,

966
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:22.961
you know,

967
00:21:22.961 --> 00:21:26.170
eating mussels with French fries and you've already got the French there,

968
00:21:26.171 --> 00:21:26.951
this is unthinkable.

969
00:21:26.951 --> 00:21:27.371
So they go,

970
00:21:27.371 --> 00:21:27.731
they go,

971
00:21:27.731 --> 00:21:28.520
they go to order,

972
00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.130
finally are going to go to war.

973
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:30.700
Um,

974
00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:31.211
so you know,

975
00:21:31.211 --> 00:21:31.430
this,

976
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:32.710
I don't want to exaggerate this too much,

977
00:21:32.711 --> 00:21:34.690
but the largest riots in,

978
00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:39.810
in Britain in the 18th century are not the riots for political reform at all.

979
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:43.990
There are the anti-catholic riots called the Gordon riots,

980
00:21:43.991 --> 00:21:45.820
which take care take place in London.

981
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:47.230
So Anti Catholicism,

982
00:21:47.231 --> 00:21:47.500
you know,

983
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.500
is very much strongly entrenched in,

984
00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:50.761
in,

985
00:21:50.761 --> 00:21:51.031
in,

986
00:21:51.031 --> 00:21:51.401
in,

987
00:21:51.401 --> 00:21:51.850
uh,

988
00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:52.520
in British,

989
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.120
uh,

990
00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:53.953
uh,

991
00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:57.300
in the British sense of,

992
00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.300
of who they were.

993
00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:59.160
Um,

994
00:21:59.160 --> 00:21:59.470
uh,

995
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:01.030
then we'll antifa French.

996
00:22:01.031 --> 00:22:01.661
We already went over.

997
00:22:01.661 --> 00:22:02.141
There we go.

998
00:22:02.141 --> 00:22:02.531
So I mean,

999
00:22:02.531 --> 00:22:05.170
those two are already linked along with absolute TISM and,

1000
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.341
uh,

1001
00:22:05.341 --> 00:22:06.940
resist anti absolutism,

1002
00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:07.541
uh,

1003
00:22:07.541 --> 00:22:09.190
and Anti Catholicism.

1004
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.740
Uh,

1005
00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:10.660
and then last,

1006
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:11.170
you know,

1007
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:11.461
there's a,

1008
00:22:11.461 --> 00:22:12.010
and this sort of,

1009
00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:12.221
these,

1010
00:22:12.221 --> 00:22:13.480
all of these things are linked.

1011
00:22:13.481 --> 00:22:13.631
I mean,

1012
00:22:13.631 --> 00:22:16.540
you could do these one of these little boxes they do in sociology or political

1013
00:22:16.541 --> 00:22:19.090
science and have these arrows running all over the place and,

1014
00:22:19.091 --> 00:22:19.271
and,

1015
00:22:19.271 --> 00:22:21.430
and you can make it there,

1016
00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:21.760
but,

1017
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:22.091
but what,

1018
00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:23.620
who are the biggest trading powers,

1019
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.011
uh,

1020
00:22:24.011 --> 00:22:24.490
in,

1021
00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:25.010
uh,

1022
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:25.810
in,

1023
00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:26.100
uh,

1024
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.250
in,

1025
00:22:27.251 --> 00:22:27.640
in,

1026
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.720
in Europe,

1027
00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:29.201
uh,

1028
00:22:29.201 --> 00:22:30.270
we forget about the,

1029
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.640
about the enormous trading vitality of Asia,

1030
00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:37.930
even at the Ysi vitality and land vitality at the same time.

1031
00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:38.741
But our,

1032
00:22:38.741 --> 00:22:39.640
without any question,

1033
00:22:39.641 --> 00:22:40.211
by this point,

1034
00:22:40.211 --> 00:22:42.370
with the decline of the Spanish empire,

1035
00:22:42.371 --> 00:22:43.840
which begins before this course,

1036
00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:44.350
uh,

1037
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:47.260
are the Dutch and the English.

1038
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.350
And so what this does is it increases,

1039
00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:50.860
you know,

1040
00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.420
the role of this commercial,

1041
00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:52.910
uh,

1042
00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:55.660
middle class and increases the role of cities,

1043
00:22:55.661 --> 00:22:56.980
particularly port cities,

1044
00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.630
of which Amsterdam is,

1045
00:22:58.900 --> 00:22:59.470
uh,

1046
00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:01.600
and it increases their,

1047
00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:02.290
uh,

1048
00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:02.521
the,

1049
00:23:02.521 --> 00:23:04.390
the role of these economic elites,

1050
00:23:04.391 --> 00:23:08.650
or they're concerned with maintaining their privileges against threats to their

1051
00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:13.800
privileges and to their prosperity no matter where they come from.

1052
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:18.040
So you could just have to amuse yourself,

1053
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:19.570
not for any kind of punitive,

1054
00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.250
think about the exam exercise,

1055
00:23:21.251 --> 00:23:21.821
but to be funded.

1056
00:23:21.821 --> 00:23:24.460
So take these categories and thinking about these other countries,

1057
00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.150
uh,

1058
00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:26.770
particularly those were absolute states,

1059
00:23:26.771 --> 00:23:29.170
other large important states in Europe,

1060
00:23:29.171 --> 00:23:33.970
and see to what extent you have these factors there.

1061
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:35.141
Prussia,

1062
00:23:35.141 --> 00:23:36.390
I already said fresher.

1063
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.300
You've got your big,

1064
00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:38.260
big noble,

1065
00:23:38.261 --> 00:23:40.000
you've got all these guys with dueling star,

1066
00:23:40.001 --> 00:23:40.821
a scars and,

1067
00:23:40.821 --> 00:23:41.001
and,

1068
00:23:41.001 --> 00:23:41.320
and,

1069
00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:41.650
uh,

1070
00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:43.900
for them to be indulging in commerce.

1071
00:23:43.901 --> 00:23:44.730
It's just sort of,

1072
00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:45.000
you know,

1073
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:45.920
crass and,

1074
00:23:45.921 --> 00:23:47.900
and not terribly manly and all of this business.

1075
00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:48.620
Uh,

1076
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.311
and you've got you,

1077
00:23:49.311 --> 00:23:50.040
you've got your,

1078
00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:53.360
your flute playing King of at Frederick the grade who could be awful,

1079
00:23:53.361 --> 00:23:53.610
you know,

1080
00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:54.443
could lash out.

1081
00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:55.340
And you know,

1082
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:55.651
Voltaire,

1083
00:23:55.651 --> 00:23:57.410
I went and hung out with Frederick the great,

1084
00:23:57.411 --> 00:23:58.340
and after a while he said,

1085
00:23:58.341 --> 00:23:59.330
let me Outta here.

1086
00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:00.260
Uh,

1087
00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:00.650
uh,

1088
00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:01.161
but you've got,

1089
00:24:01.161 --> 00:24:01.881
you've got Berlin,

1090
00:24:01.881 --> 00:24:03.180
which was a very important town,

1091
00:24:03.181 --> 00:24:04.400
but it's a very important town,

1092
00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:08.180
very important city because it's got this huge garrison and has got factories

1093
00:24:08.181 --> 00:24:09.920
turning out military uniforms.

1094
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.580
Uh,

1095
00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.151
and it's got to,

1096
00:24:11.151 --> 00:24:12.350
it's got Potsdam,

1097
00:24:12.351 --> 00:24:13.880
palace and all of this.

1098
00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:14.950
Uh,

1099
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:19.730
so it's not at all the same thing as Amsterdam or London or any of the other

1100
00:24:19.731 --> 00:24:20.690
trading cities.

1101
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:21.270
Uh,

1102
00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:22.160
around,

1103
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.030
uh,

1104
00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:23.601
uh,

1105
00:24:23.601 --> 00:24:24.131
with the case of,

1106
00:24:24.131 --> 00:24:24.341
of,

1107
00:24:24.341 --> 00:24:24.621
of,

1108
00:24:24.621 --> 00:24:25.011
of,

1109
00:24:25.011 --> 00:24:25.240
uh,

1110
00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.330
Russia is even easier.

1111
00:24:26.331 --> 00:24:28.850
You've got a practically nonexistent and middle class.

1112
00:24:28.851 --> 00:24:31.520
You've got all sorts of nobles and they do,

1113
00:24:31.521 --> 00:24:32.354
are involved in,

1114
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.721
you know,

1115
00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:33.261
in commerce.

1116
00:24:33.261 --> 00:24:33.861
Some of them are,

1117
00:24:33.861 --> 00:24:36.170
but mostly what they do is they serve the state.

1118
00:24:36.171 --> 00:24:38.180
They're called a service nobility.

1119
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:39.830
They're not serving the cities.

1120
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.761
They're not serving,

1121
00:24:40.761 --> 00:24:40.971
you know,

1122
00:24:40.971 --> 00:24:41.601
commerce.

1123
00:24:41.601 --> 00:24:43.130
What they're doing is they're serving the state.

1124
00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.510
They're serving this huge,

1125
00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:44.920
you know,

1126
00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:45.753
lumbering.

1127
00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.510
A strange guy,

1128
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.230
uh,

1129
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.590
Peter,

1130
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:49.041
the great,

1131
00:24:49.041 --> 00:24:51.100
and then you could take other places like Italy and,

1132
00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:51.361
and,

1133
00:24:51.361 --> 00:24:51.680
and,

1134
00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.101
you know,

1135
00:24:52.101 --> 00:24:52.820
smaller,

1136
00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:53.601
smaller cities,

1137
00:24:53.601 --> 00:24:56.000
but you don't yet have these big state structures.

1138
00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:57.230
So if you're looking back,

1139
00:24:57.231 --> 00:24:59.210
say from the end of the 19th century,

1140
00:24:59.211 --> 00:24:59.900
it's kind of,

1141
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:00.860
it's not easy to see,

1142
00:25:00.861 --> 00:25:01.850
but you can see these,

1143
00:25:01.851 --> 00:25:02.151
these,

1144
00:25:02.151 --> 00:25:02.920
you know,

1145
00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.920
you don't ever think that history runs on railroad tracks and,

1146
00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.320
and all you need is the timetable to show when modernization shows up.

1147
00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.640
That's almost ludicrous.

1148
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:12.160
A word really.

1149
00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.530
And contemporary a,

1150
00:25:13.531 --> 00:25:14.660
a social science,

1151
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:15.290
uh,

1152
00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:17.810
or Orthodox Marxists where you just had to say,

1153
00:25:17.811 --> 00:25:18.081
well,

1154
00:25:18.081 --> 00:25:21.050
eventually the proletariat will rise up cause the bourgeoise he did this,

1155
00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:21.590
uh,

1156
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:22.011
before.

1157
00:25:22.011 --> 00:25:23.990
But yet when you look back from the 19th century,

1158
00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.660
these factors do count and explaining how countries,

1159
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:27.360
uh,

1160
00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:27.500
uh,

1161
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.390
turn out to be the way they are.

1162
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:31.250
And when you're trying to look at the origins of war,

1163
00:25:31.251 --> 00:25:31.521
a one,

1164
00:25:31.521 --> 00:25:31.761
I mean,

1165
00:25:31.761 --> 00:25:32.541
it mattered that,

1166
00:25:32.541 --> 00:25:32.721
that,

1167
00:25:32.721 --> 00:25:33.200
that,

1168
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:33.531
that,

1169
00:25:33.531 --> 00:25:33.890
uh,

1170
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:36.350
Germany is run by this kind of Madcap Doofus,

1171
00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:36.950
uh,

1172
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:37.430
uh,

1173
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.730
you know,

1174
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:40.170
Wilhelm the second who was intellectually lazy and,

1175
00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:40.391
and,

1176
00:25:40.391 --> 00:25:41.150
and,

1177
00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:41.550
uh,

1178
00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:42.141
I like to,

1179
00:25:42.141 --> 00:25:42.351
you know,

1180
00:25:42.351 --> 00:25:44.420
break a bottles of Riesling over a,

1181
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:45.051
a bright,

1182
00:25:45.051 --> 00:25:46.330
shiny battleships and,

1183
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.730
and didn't concentrate on things very long and sends off a,

1184
00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:50.120
you know,

1185
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.430
provocative telegrams here and there to make everybody mad.

1186
00:25:52.431 --> 00:25:54.920
I mean that it has a long run outcome,

1187
00:25:54.921 --> 00:25:55.191
which,

1188
00:25:55.191 --> 00:25:55.470
you know,

1189
00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:56.840
Costa the lives of millions of people.

1190
00:25:56.841 --> 00:25:57.111
But,

1191
00:25:57.111 --> 00:25:57.381
but,

1192
00:25:57.381 --> 00:25:57.680
uh,

1193
00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.191
so anyway,

1194
00:25:58.191 --> 00:25:58.551
here we go.

1195
00:25:58.551 --> 00:25:58.761
I mean,

1196
00:25:58.761 --> 00:25:59.261
but it's just,

1197
00:25:59.261 --> 00:26:00.440
it's kind of fun to think about that.

1198
00:26:00.441 --> 00:26:01.280
So that's what we were doing.

1199
00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:02.390
We were thinking about that.

1200
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:03.080
Now,

1201
00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:03.913
now let's,

1202
00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:04.730
let's,

1203
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:06.080
let's dim the lights.

1204
00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:07.213
Here we go.

1205
00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:10.700
How do we dim the lights?

1206
00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:12.790
I can't remember how he dimmed the lights.

1207
00:26:12.791 --> 00:26:13.624
Is that what you do?

1208
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.273
<v 1>Aw,</v>

1209
00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:16.790
okay,

1210
00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:17.600
<v 0>well that's good.</v>

1211
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.140
Okay.

1212
00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:18.681
Oh no,

1213
00:26:18.681 --> 00:26:19.520
that's not good here.

1214
00:26:19.521 --> 00:26:21.560
We got to get further down than that.

1215
00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:22.790
Hey.

1216
00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:23.350
Oh,

1217
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:24.210
all right,

1218
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.960
so electric.

1219
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:34.023
Okay.

1220
00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:34.721
Now let's,

1221
00:26:34.721 --> 00:26:36.820
I'm paralleling what,

1222
00:26:36.821 --> 00:26:37.240
what,

1223
00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:37.661
what,

1224
00:26:37.661 --> 00:26:38.410
uh,

1225
00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:40.600
you been been reading?

1226
00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:41.853
Let's,

1227
00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:42.640
how over.

1228
00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.473
Thanks.

1229
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:48.030
Let's look a little bit at the Dutch republic because people talk about England

1230
00:26:48.031 --> 00:26:48.960
and Britain all the time.

1231
00:26:48.961 --> 00:26:49.370
And,

1232
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:49.530
uh,

1233
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:50.071
so let me,

1234
00:26:50.071 --> 00:26:50.370
uh,

1235
00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:52.440
talk about the Dutch republic.

1236
00:26:52.441 --> 00:26:57.441
And this will kind of bring some of these factors together along with the idea

1237
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:00.420
of what people thought they were,

1238
00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:01.740
what is their identity?

1239
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.910
And here again,

1240
00:27:02.911 --> 00:27:05.730
we'll look at some paintings and you're not responsible for these paintings,

1241
00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:09.930
but we'll kind of illustrate ways in which the duck Dutch republic and their

1242
00:27:09.931 --> 00:27:14.190
social structure and what they emphasized and who they thought they were was

1243
00:27:14.191 --> 00:27:15.150
very different than,

1244
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.530
for example,

1245
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:17.311
La Bella.

1246
00:27:17.311 --> 00:27:18.144
False.

1247
00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:19.050
Um,

1248
00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:19.710
so,

1249
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:20.130
uh,

1250
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:21.780
here we have Amsterdam.

1251
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:22.690
Uh,

1252
00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:23.010
and,

1253
00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:23.761
and so Amsterdam,

1254
00:27:23.761 --> 00:27:24.594
you know,

1255
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:25.280
uh,

1256
00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:25.800
it,

1257
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.610
it grows dramatically because of this global trade in,

1258
00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:30.520
uh,

1259
00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:31.100
in,

1260
00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:31.380
in,

1261
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.850
in the 17th century.

1262
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:33.690
And,

1263
00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:34.050
uh,

1264
00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:34.801
that was 16,

1265
00:27:34.801 --> 00:27:35.640
13.

1266
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:36.421
I made this,

1267
00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:37.550
this is all a bunch of jumble,

1268
00:27:37.551 --> 00:27:37.720
but,

1269
00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:38.221
but this is,

1270
00:27:38.221 --> 00:27:38.460
you know,

1271
00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.130
16 a 40 or something like that

1272
00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:43.793
later.

1273
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:44.550
Um,

1274
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:46.080
but what you have are these canals.

1275
00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:46.621
And many of you are,

1276
00:27:46.621 --> 00:27:48.330
some of you have had the good fortune to go to.

1277
00:27:48.331 --> 00:27:50.880
One of yours was wonderful cities and,

1278
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:51.421
and you know,

1279
00:27:51.421 --> 00:27:56.421
the canals were used to transport goods and thus the city structure itself,

1280
00:27:56.551 --> 00:28:01.320
the way the city was built or with houses along the canals reflect the economic

1281
00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:03.630
primacy of global trade.

1282
00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:03.931
I mean,

1283
00:28:03.931 --> 00:28:04.501
at this time,

1284
00:28:04.501 --> 00:28:05.730
the doctor sending herring,

1285
00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.530
these long sort of flat boats,

1286
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.750
herring ships are going all the way to Newfoundland,

1287
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:10.500
uh,

1288
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:10.741
you know,

1289
00:28:10.741 --> 00:28:12.480
in the 17th century in Iceland,

1290
00:28:12.481 --> 00:28:14.340
freezing off the coast of Iceland.

1291
00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:16.070
And they control and dominate the,

1292
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.870
the Baltic trade in herring is an important part of that cause.

1293
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:21.840
Hearing we'll keep once it's salted and all that.

1294
00:28:21.841 --> 00:28:23.160
So the city of Amsterdam,

1295
00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:26.700
Amsterdam grows up not only as part of the struggle,

1296
00:28:26.701 --> 00:28:28.620
Victoria struggle against,

1297
00:28:28.621 --> 00:28:29.060
uh,

1298
00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:29.250
uh,

1299
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:29.891
the Spanish,

1300
00:28:29.891 --> 00:28:30.400
uh,

1301
00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:30.770
uh,

1302
00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:31.890
a Spanish armies.

1303
00:28:31.891 --> 00:28:33.180
There's a wonderful book by my,

1304
00:28:33.181 --> 00:28:33.630
uh,

1305
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:33.811
uh,

1306
00:28:33.811 --> 00:28:34.644
a former,

1307
00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:35.080
uh,

1308
00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:35.880
uh,

1309
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.140
colleague Jeffrey Parker.

1310
00:28:37.141 --> 00:28:38.520
I called the Spanish road,

1311
00:28:38.521 --> 00:28:42.870
was talked about how difficult it was for the Spa Spanish to get troops all the

1312
00:28:42.871 --> 00:28:43.441
way to the,

1313
00:28:43.441 --> 00:28:44.100
to,

1314
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:44.401
uh,

1315
00:28:44.401 --> 00:28:45.061
the Netherlands.

1316
00:28:45.061 --> 00:28:45.211
I mean,

1317
00:28:45.211 --> 00:28:48.390
they had to go from it from Italy because much of Italy was controlled by Spain

1318
00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:52.200
through the Alps all the way up along the Rhine and finally get into,

1319
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:52.710
uh,

1320
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:53.521
get into,

1321
00:28:53.521 --> 00:28:54.000
uh,

1322
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:54.211
uh,

1323
00:28:54.211 --> 00:28:55.011
the Dutch republic.

1324
00:28:55.011 --> 00:28:55.591
And it was a,

1325
00:28:55.591 --> 00:28:56.790
it was a losing battle.

1326
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:57.390
But,

1327
00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:57.631
you know,

1328
00:28:57.631 --> 00:29:00.850
Amsterdam reflects this kind of primacy of,

1329
00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:01.201
of,

1330
00:29:01.201 --> 00:29:02.520
of the global economy,

1331
00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:03.120
uh,

1332
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.130
because it's such an important trading power.

1333
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:05.850
Uh,

1334
00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:09.450
but also this sort of federalist decentralized aspect that I've tried to,

1335
00:29:09.451 --> 00:29:09.900
uh,

1336
00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:10.390
uh,

1337
00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:11.040
uh,

1338
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.570
tried to describe,

1339
00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:12.840
uh,

1340
00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.321
this is the,

1341
00:29:13.321 --> 00:29:13.501
you know,

1342
00:29:13.501 --> 00:29:14.100
the ship.

1343
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.660
This is the ship yard behind,

1344
00:29:15.661 --> 00:29:15.901
in fact,

1345
00:29:15.901 --> 00:29:16.980
this building and that behind,

1346
00:29:16.981 --> 00:29:17.671
it's still there.

1347
00:29:17.671 --> 00:29:19.330
I did it when I go to Amsterdam,

1348
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:20.400
not frequently,

1349
00:29:20.401 --> 00:29:20.910
but I've been there for,

1350
00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:21.061
you know,

1351
00:29:21.061 --> 00:29:22.050
10 or 12 times or something.

1352
00:29:22.051 --> 00:29:23.100
I did a field trip there.

1353
00:29:23.101 --> 00:29:23.311
I mean,

1354
00:29:23.311 --> 00:29:24.060
we took a,

1355
00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:24.210
you know,

1356
00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:25.560
all these alumni around to look at it,

1357
00:29:25.561 --> 00:29:26.371
look at all this stuff,

1358
00:29:26.371 --> 00:29:27.960
and that was mildly fun.

1359
00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:28.920
Um,

1360
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:29.441
but the,

1361
00:29:29.441 --> 00:29:30.630
the what,

1362
00:29:30.631 --> 00:29:30.891
what the,

1363
00:29:30.891 --> 00:29:31.770
what the Dutch did,

1364
00:29:31.771 --> 00:29:32.310
I mean the,

1365
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:33.143
the Netherlands is,

1366
00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:35.970
is extraordinarily small country.

1367
00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:36.840
Um,

1368
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.060
and it's the most populated country in Europe,

1369
00:29:39.061 --> 00:29:42.820
then it per square kilometer and is now,

1370
00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:43.430
uh,

1371
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:44.141
at once.

1372
00:29:44.141 --> 00:29:45.070
And so what they tried to,

1373
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:46.840
what they have to do in order to,

1374
00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:47.320
you know,

1375
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.660
in order to feed the population,

1376
00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:51.760
you have to have more land now,

1377
00:29:51.761 --> 00:29:53.500
how you're going to get more land,

1378
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.430
when are they credible things.

1379
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:55.061
If you're driving,

1380
00:29:55.061 --> 00:29:55.930
say from growing again,

1381
00:29:55.931 --> 00:29:58.750
and you're going to go all the way down to Amsterdam when you drive along the

1382
00:29:58.751 --> 00:29:59.410
coast,

1383
00:29:59.410 --> 00:29:59.621
you know,

1384
00:29:59.621 --> 00:30:00.700
you're driving along this,

1385
00:30:00.701 --> 00:30:01.600
this sort of road,

1386
00:30:01.601 --> 00:30:01.780
this,

1387
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.040
that's out in the sea.

1388
00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:03.430
And,

1389
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:08.310
and all the land between the water on both be on the left side of you and a

1390
00:30:08.311 --> 00:30:08.621
long,

1391
00:30:08.621 --> 00:30:10.990
long way has been reclaimed from the sea.

1392
00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:12.760
So this is the 17th century.

1393
00:30:12.761 --> 00:30:12.881
I mean,

1394
00:30:12.881 --> 00:30:14.560
this isn't sort of scuba diving now off,

1395
00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:14.710
you know,

1396
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:15.160
the,

1397
00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.140
the great barrier reef or something like that.

1398
00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:17.471
I mean,

1399
00:30:17.471 --> 00:30:20.710
so what they're doing is they're reclaiming the land from the sea.

1400
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:21.250
Uh,

1401
00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:25.120
now what this has to do with global economy is that you have to be able to feed

1402
00:30:25.121 --> 00:30:25.960
the population.

1403
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.070
And so they have,

1404
00:30:27.071 --> 00:30:28.390
along with the English,

1405
00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:31.870
and these two facts are related and agricultural revolution.

1406
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:34.210
They have an agricultural revolution,

1407
00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:34.980
uh,

1408
00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:35.230
uh,

1409
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:38.880
investment and commercialized agriculture and increase in the poppy,

1410
00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:39.230
in,

1411
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:40.240
in production,

1412
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.380
in rural areas.

1413
00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.090
And in the case of the Netherlands,

1414
00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:44.620
it's because of this,

1415
00:30:44.621 --> 00:30:47.230
I'll talk about why it happened in Britain another time.

1416
00:30:47.231 --> 00:30:48.580
It's because they reclaim land.

1417
00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:50.890
How much land did they reclaim from the sea?

1418
00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:51.281
Well,

1419
00:30:51.281 --> 00:30:53.020
36,000 acres,

1420
00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:54.940
just between 50,

1421
00:30:54.941 --> 00:30:55.660
90,

1422
00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.040
and 1615.

1423
00:30:57.041 --> 00:31:00.640
So that's a phenomenal amount and they keep going over and over again.

1424
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.240
And so the population of the Dutch republic increases between 15,

1425
00:31:04.241 --> 00:31:05.470
50 and 16.

1426
00:31:05.471 --> 00:31:06.291
52,

1427
00:31:06.291 --> 00:31:07.870
almost 2 million people.

1428
00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:09.370
And this is in a pretty small,

1429
00:31:09.371 --> 00:31:09.521
I mean,

1430
00:31:09.521 --> 00:31:10.390
it's bigger than Belgium,

1431
00:31:10.391 --> 00:31:10.720
but it's,

1432
00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.830
this is a pretty small,

1433
00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:12.580
uh,

1434
00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:12.731
uh,

1435
00:31:12.731 --> 00:31:13.750
a territory.

1436
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.440
Um,

1437
00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.150
and so Amsterdam,

1438
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.020
um,

1439
00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:17.580
by mid,

1440
00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:17.950
uh,

1441
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:19.060
by mid 17th century,

1442
00:31:19.061 --> 00:31:20.140
by 1650,

1443
00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:20.710
uh,

1444
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:24.520
increases to 150,000,

1445
00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:24.970
uh,

1446
00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:25.600
people.

1447
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.150
So they build these three large canals.

1448
00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:28.631
And this,

1449
00:31:28.631 --> 00:31:29.620
this expands,

1450
00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:30.020
uh,

1451
00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:30.853
the,

1452
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:31.720
the,

1453
00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.670
the area of the city by four times.

1454
00:31:33.671 --> 00:31:34.900
And what this means is that the,

1455
00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:35.330
that,

1456
00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:36.280
that merchants,

1457
00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:36.820
uh,

1458
00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:41.820
that boats can dock outside these kind of big warehouses and can unload or,

1459
00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:43.430
uh,

1460
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:44.440
it depending on the case,

1461
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:45.070
uh,

1462
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.810
load,

1463
00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:46.241
uh,

1464
00:31:46.241 --> 00:31:47.050
goods.

1465
00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:47.470
Um,

1466
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:48.303
and so,

1467
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.790
uh,

1468
00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:53.790
you have 500 miles of canals dug just in the middle decades of the 17th century.

1469
00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:58.990
So it becomes a sort of economic dynamo.

1470
00:31:59.090 --> 00:31:59.360
Uh,

1471
00:31:59.360 --> 00:31:59.650
uh,

1472
00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:00.401
because of that,

1473
00:32:00.401 --> 00:32:05.401
and in Dutch traders are to be found everywhere in the 1630 or 2,500 trading

1474
00:32:07.151 --> 00:32:07.984
ships.

1475
00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:08.560
Uh,

1476
00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:09.130
and,

1477
00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:09.460
uh,

1478
00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.370
they become the principal supplier of grain and fish,

1479
00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.030
uh,

1480
00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:13.540
in,

1481
00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:14.111
in Europe.

1482
00:32:14.111 --> 00:32:14.830
And the Dutch,

1483
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:15.280
uh,

1484
00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.810
dominate the Baltic,

1485
00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.300
uh,

1486
00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.133
a Baltic,

1487
00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:18.640
uh,

1488
00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.121
trade.

1489
00:32:19.121 --> 00:32:19.331
I mean,

1490
00:32:19.331 --> 00:32:20.470
cities like Gdansk,

1491
00:32:20.471 --> 00:32:23.380
which we tend to forget about unfortunately,

1492
00:32:23.381 --> 00:32:24.640
which is a very important,

1493
00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:25.060
uh,

1494
00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:25.680
port,

1495
00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:25.960
uh,

1496
00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:26.400
then,

1497
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.610
and still now it's worse.

1498
00:32:27.611 --> 00:32:28.750
Solidarity began to,

1499
00:32:28.751 --> 00:32:29.501
as many of you know,

1500
00:32:29.501 --> 00:32:29.681
in,

1501
00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:30.310
in,

1502
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:31.630
in 1980,

1503
00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:31.961
uh,

1504
00:32:31.961 --> 00:32:33.280
is an important,

1505
00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:33.970
uh,

1506
00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:34.840
important port,

1507
00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:35.380
uh,

1508
00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:36.610
in all of this.

1509
00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:36.880
And,

1510
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:41.690
and they reached the West indies are the east indies and the 1620s in the 1630.

1511
00:32:41.691 --> 00:32:43.370
So they bring back to cinema,

1512
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:44.340
nutmeg and,

1513
00:32:44.341 --> 00:32:45.150
and all sorts of,

1514
00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:45.580
uh,

1515
00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:46.220
uh,

1516
00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.020
in all sorts of valuables.

1517
00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:51.710
And it's this kind of wealth that allow them to fight this long,

1518
00:32:51.711 --> 00:32:53.690
hard war of independence,

1519
00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.220
which they finally,

1520
00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:56.600
they finally win.

1521
00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.280
Now why is this in here?

1522
00:32:58.281 --> 00:32:58.401
Now?

1523
00:32:58.401 --> 00:32:59.750
This is Rembrandt is most of,

1524
00:32:59.751 --> 00:33:00.470
you know,

1525
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:01.130
this is,

1526
00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:01.490
uh,

1527
00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:03.140
this is called the nightwatch.

1528
00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:03.920
Um,

1529
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.220
and the importance of this painting is who's being painted.

1530
00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:08.480
And more than that,

1531
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:09.403
who is,

1532
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:11.780
is getting Rembrandt to paint this.

1533
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.981
And you know,

1534
00:33:12.981 --> 00:33:14.390
if you go down into France,

1535
00:33:14.391 --> 00:33:14.641
if you,

1536
00:33:14.641 --> 00:33:15.261
if you go to,

1537
00:33:15.261 --> 00:33:15.710
uh,

1538
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.950
uh,

1539
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:16.840
my bed phones,

1540
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:17.421
if you go to,

1541
00:33:17.421 --> 00:33:18.320
to there,

1542
00:33:18.321 --> 00:33:18.570
I mean,

1543
00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:22.040
but the painting is dominated by nobles who want pictures of themselves,

1544
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:22.700
uh,

1545
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.300
or the,

1546
00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:23.571
you know,

1547
00:33:23.571 --> 00:33:23.781
the,

1548
00:33:23.781 --> 00:33:23.990
the,

1549
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.470
the,

1550
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.620
uh,

1551
00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:25.850
tiresome Sun King,

1552
00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:26.750
uh,

1553
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:27.770
and all that sort of,

1554
00:33:27.771 --> 00:33:28.310
you know,

1555
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:30.380
miserable hangers on a very rich,

1556
00:33:30.381 --> 00:33:31.550
miserable hangers on.

1557
00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:32.151
And what,

1558
00:33:32.151 --> 00:33:35.180
who'd love to ditch Dutch painted what Dutch painters painted?

1559
00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:38.720
I reflects in the same way that renaissance art reflected,

1560
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:39.111
you know,

1561
00:33:39.111 --> 00:33:39.650
what,

1562
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:41.720
what was important to renaissance Italy?

1563
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:42.350
Uh,

1564
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:44.960
who did the commissioning of painting?

1565
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.651
I care about it.

1566
00:33:45.651 --> 00:33:46.431
My mother was a painter.

1567
00:33:46.431 --> 00:33:47.330
She was a portrait painter.

1568
00:33:47.331 --> 00:33:48.050
That's how we,

1569
00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:48.960
that's how we survive,

1570
00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:49.700
uh,

1571
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:50.091
uh,

1572
00:33:50.091 --> 00:33:50.541
in Portland,

1573
00:33:50.541 --> 00:33:51.020
Oregon.

1574
00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:51.560
Um,

1575
00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:51.861
uh,

1576
00:33:51.861 --> 00:33:52.101
what,

1577
00:33:52.101 --> 00:33:54.410
who commissioned these paintings and what they,

1578
00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.900
what they painted tell you who these people thought they were.

1579
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.920
So that's pretty interesting.

1580
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.970
So who are these?

1581
00:33:58.971 --> 00:33:59.870
This is the night watch.

1582
00:33:59.871 --> 00:34:02.450
These are the guys who run Amsterdam.

1583
00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:03.290
Uh,

1584
00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:03.681
these,

1585
00:34:03.681 --> 00:34:04.261
this is a,

1586
00:34:04.261 --> 00:34:05.080
essentially the,

1587
00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:05.913
the town,

1588
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:06.890
the town hall,

1589
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.341
uh,

1590
00:34:07.341 --> 00:34:08.390
of Amsterdam.

1591
00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:09.050
Uh,

1592
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:10.520
and in fact that building itself,

1593
00:34:10.521 --> 00:34:11.960
which I don't have a slide in it,

1594
00:34:11.961 --> 00:34:12.111
you know,

1595
00:34:12.111 --> 00:34:13.250
it's extremely modest.

1596
00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:14.900
It looks so terribly different than,

1597
00:34:14.901 --> 00:34:15.380
than,

1598
00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:16.220
than anything.

1599
00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:17.210
Uh,

1600
00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:19.520
the Spanish palace outside of Madrid or,

1601
00:34:19.521 --> 00:34:19.811
or,

1602
00:34:19.811 --> 00:34:21.710
or anything that ever heading do with the,

1603
00:34:21.711 --> 00:34:22.140
the,

1604
00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:22.390
the,

1605
00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:22.541
the,

1606
00:34:22.541 --> 00:34:23.060
the,

1607
00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:23.460
uh,

1608
00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:23.750
uh,

1609
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:24.780
Prussian kings are,

1610
00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:25.940
and all that.

1611
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:26.420
Well,

1612
00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:27.200
it's pretty obvious.

1613
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:27.650
Um,

1614
00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:28.610
so this is,

1615
00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.290
this is the way in a house,

1616
00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:30.710
and here,

1617
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:31.670
this is very classic.

1618
00:34:31.671 --> 00:34:32.900
I'm not a professor of architecture,

1619
00:34:32.901 --> 00:34:33.381
but it's obvious.

1620
00:34:33.381 --> 00:34:37.430
This is northern European architecture that you can see in northern France that

1621
00:34:37.431 --> 00:34:40.450
he's like a Haas and other places are Sharvin admins the area.

1622
00:34:40.451 --> 00:34:43.910
And they all is one of the most fabulous pluses anywhere or in the plastic

1623
00:34:43.911 --> 00:34:44.271
voltage,

1624
00:34:44.271 --> 00:34:46.550
which is by far the most beautiful plus in Paris.

1625
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:47.060
Uh,

1626
00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:47.750
you have this,

1627
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:48.561
this kind of architecture,

1628
00:34:48.561 --> 00:34:50.810
but this is the weighing house there.

1629
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.650
And so,

1630
00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:52.371
I mean the buildings,

1631
00:34:52.371 --> 00:34:53.450
and here's another one.

1632
00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:54.553
Uh,

1633
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:56.750
and so the buildings are the most important.

1634
00:34:56.751 --> 00:35:01.490
Buildings in the cities are not huge or over the top rope churches,

1635
00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.100
a sentence of Jay Zoo in Rome for example,

1636
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:05.390
they are weighing houses.

1637
00:35:05.391 --> 00:35:06.224
They are things that,

1638
00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:06.710
uh,

1639
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.110
and the town hall is a very modest proportions.

1640
00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:09.340
And,

1641
00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.590
and because it's Calvinist,

1642
00:35:10.591 --> 00:35:10.761
I mean,

1643
00:35:10.761 --> 00:35:12.050
Calvinists were an exactly,

1644
00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:12.370
uh,

1645
00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:13.170
it was French called Rigo,

1646
00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:13.580
no word.

1647
00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:13.971
Exactly.

1648
00:35:13.971 --> 00:35:14.151
You know,

1649
00:35:14.151 --> 00:35:14.511
wild,

1650
00:35:14.511 --> 00:35:14.691
fun,

1651
00:35:14.691 --> 00:35:15.524
loving types.

1652
00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:16.100
Uh,

1653
00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:16.550
you know,

1654
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.751
the,

1655
00:35:16.751 --> 00:35:17.210
the,

1656
00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:19.550
even the churches are completely denuded of,

1657
00:35:19.551 --> 00:35:22.280
of the kinds of baroque swooning,

1658
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:24.500
cherubs and clutter that,

1659
00:35:24.501 --> 00:35:25.171
that you found in,

1660
00:35:25.171 --> 00:35:25.850
in beautiful,

1661
00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:26.840
I'm not knocking the broke,

1662
00:35:26.841 --> 00:35:30.620
but beautiful churches or in building [inaudible] in Vienna is a good example of

1663
00:35:30.621 --> 00:35:30.861
that.

1664
00:35:30.861 --> 00:35:32.570
Or anywhere is a good example of that.

1665
00:35:32.571 --> 00:35:33.200
My God.

1666
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:33.770
Um,

1667
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:35.360
and here's another weighing house.

1668
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:37.770
This is in Gouda as in the cheese,

1669
00:35:37.771 --> 00:35:40.350
but the town of Gouda to Amsterdam wasn't alum.

1670
00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.220
Now here,

1671
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.620
these are houses that were built along the canals.

1672
00:35:43.621 --> 00:35:45.600
And so you've got these warehouses along the canals.

1673
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:46.950
And here's where the bankers,

1674
00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.410
the Dutch had the most along with the English,

1675
00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:49.680
uh,

1676
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.800
the most sophisticated banking system in the world.

1677
00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:53.690
Uh,

1678
00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:54.000
uh,

1679
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.230
the Lloyd's of London,

1680
00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:55.980
uh,

1681
00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.090
which now does things like,

1682
00:35:57.091 --> 00:35:57.331
you know,

1683
00:35:57.331 --> 00:35:57.660
uh,

1684
00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.580
ensure quarterbacks knees and things.

1685
00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:00.120
Uh,

1686
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.640
but it begins in the 18th century.

1687
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:03.390
Uh,

1688
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:05.670
when people go into the docs and say,

1689
00:36:05.671 --> 00:36:06.504
look,

1690
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:07.343
we want to,

1691
00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:10.560
cause a lot of these ships go blob on the way back,

1692
00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:13.410
or are taken by by pirates and stuff like that and said,

1693
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:13.670
well,

1694
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:14.850
we want to ensure the ship.

1695
00:36:14.851 --> 00:36:17.910
Will you sign up for 10% of the value of this insurance?

1696
00:36:17.911 --> 00:36:19.440
And that's how Lloyd's of London starts.

1697
00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:20.670
But to have the same thing in,

1698
00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.010
in the equivalent in Amsterdam as well.

1699
00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:23.770
And you've got that,

1700
00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:25.870
you have access to capital by these guys.

1701
00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:26.401
Those guys,

1702
00:36:26.401 --> 00:36:27.234
they're no longer there.

1703
00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.860
The middleclass guys behind the,

1704
00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:29.910
behind the screen,

1705
00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:30.600
uh,

1706
00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.610
who are going to invest in these long,

1707
00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:33.150
you know,

1708
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:33.601
tracks.

1709
00:36:33.601 --> 00:36:36.900
You send off a ship to Newfoundland or to Iceland or,

1710
00:36:36.901 --> 00:36:36.930
or,

1711
00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:37.080
or,

1712
00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:37.470
or,

1713
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:38.600
or even into the Mediterranean,

1714
00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:39.860
they start getting into the Mediterranean.

1715
00:36:39.861 --> 00:36:40.830
And that scares the hell out of,

1716
00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:41.460
uh,

1717
00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.440
out of the other commercial rivals.

1718
00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:44.070
So,

1719
00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:46.440
but you build these also houses for people to live in.

1720
00:36:46.441 --> 00:36:48.510
And because there's not a lot of room between the canals,

1721
00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.850
that's why they're so steep when you walk up these things.

1722
00:36:50.851 --> 00:36:51.031
I mean,

1723
00:36:51.031 --> 00:36:51.480
it's really,

1724
00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.590
it's almost like that it says,

1725
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:56.730
be inclined and they seem to be reaching toward the sky there,

1726
00:36:56.731 --> 00:36:58.610
but not reaching towards the sky as in,

1727
00:36:58.611 --> 00:36:59.010
uh,

1728
00:36:59.010 --> 00:36:59.370
you know,

1729
00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:01.890
it's in the cupola of a Baroque church.

1730
00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.450
We were supposed to see God at the top here.

1731
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.910
They're trying to,

1732
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:07.740
they look up and they see money at the top or whatever.

1733
00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:08.161
But,

1734
00:37:08.161 --> 00:37:08.431
but,

1735
00:37:08.431 --> 00:37:08.501
uh,

1736
00:37:08.501 --> 00:37:08.731
I mean,

1737
00:37:08.731 --> 00:37:09.564
they were religious.

1738
00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:10.051
It's well,

1739
00:37:10.051 --> 00:37:11.220
but it was a different kind of,

1740
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:12.263
of religion.

1741
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:12.541
And,

1742
00:37:12.541 --> 00:37:13.250
and here,

1743
00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:13.420
uh,

1744
00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:13.921
this is a,

1745
00:37:13.921 --> 00:37:14.101
you know,

1746
00:37:14.101 --> 00:37:15.390
a more modern example.

1747
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.011
And with a little,

1748
00:37:16.011 --> 00:37:16.441
a little,

1749
00:37:16.441 --> 00:37:16.770
uh,

1750
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:17.040
you know,

1751
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.690
Hash cafe next to it or something.

1752
00:37:18.691 --> 00:37:20.130
But this is Rembrandt's house.

1753
00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:21.010
Uh,

1754
00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:21.630
uh,

1755
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:22.051
and you know,

1756
00:37:22.051 --> 00:37:24.420
he had to lose some somewhere and that's where he lived because he paints these

1757
00:37:24.421 --> 00:37:25.140
people.

1758
00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:27.870
And Rembrandt did have one time where you started painting kind of Catholic

1759
00:37:27.871 --> 00:37:28.410
themes,

1760
00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:30.720
but basically he's like these other guys,

1761
00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:31.260
uh,

1762
00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.093
they're painting,

1763
00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:32.730
uh,

1764
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:33.840
well I'll tell you in a minute,

1765
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:37.890
but they're painting middleclass life in the Netherlands.

1766
00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:38.460
Uh,

1767
00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:40.350
and they don't do big battle scenes.

1768
00:37:40.351 --> 00:37:44.400
You have to go to the southern Netherlands or Belgium for that or into France.

1769
00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:45.090
Uh,

1770
00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:45.870
so that's,

1771
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:46.703
that's what they do.

1772
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:47.431
Uh,

1773
00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:47.940
and that's,

1774
00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:48.750
that's what,

1775
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:49.710
that's what they look like.

1776
00:37:49.711 --> 00:37:50.544
That's pretty obvious.

1777
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:51.210
Um,

1778
00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:52.170
this is,

1779
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:52.681
uh,

1780
00:37:52.681 --> 00:37:57.681
an orphanage they had without question the most sophisticated charitable

1781
00:37:57.811 --> 00:37:58.950
institutions anywhere.

1782
00:37:59.130 --> 00:37:59.550
In fact,

1783
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:01.030
we know what they ate there.

1784
00:38:01.031 --> 00:38:01.260
Ma,

1785
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.590
it was the most prosperous country for ordinary people anywhere.

1786
00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:05.910
The Diet here,

1787
00:38:05.911 --> 00:38:07.320
we know what they ate in their meals.

1788
00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.180
They ate much better than,

1789
00:38:09.181 --> 00:38:09.451
than,

1790
00:38:09.451 --> 00:38:09.811
than,

1791
00:38:09.811 --> 00:38:10.230
uh,

1792
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.680
uh,

1793
00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.140
than poor people did almost anywhere else.

1794
00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:13.950
Indeed,

1795
00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:16.740
some ordinary workers bought paintings,

1796
00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:17.490
uh,

1797
00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:18.323
by,

1798
00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:19.111
by,

1799
00:38:19.111 --> 00:38:19.530
uh,

1800
00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:19.830
uh,

1801
00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:21.420
Steen and all sorts of these other,

1802
00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:22.860
these other people.

1803
00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:23.400
Uh,

1804
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.270
and here is,

1805
00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:24.630
uh,

1806
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:25.530
a work house.

1807
00:38:25.531 --> 00:38:26.041
This is a,

1808
00:38:26.041 --> 00:38:27.450
is a prison basically.

1809
00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:28.370
Uh,

1810
00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:29.820
they were organized for that too.

1811
00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:30.571
Now one shouldn't,

1812
00:38:30.571 --> 00:38:30.960
Eh,

1813
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:31.310
you know,

1814
00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:32.970
it was the place of tolerance.

1815
00:38:32.971 --> 00:38:33.870
There's of toleration,

1816
00:38:33.871 --> 00:38:34.860
there's no doubt about that.

1817
00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:35.980
And during the enlightenment,

1818
00:38:35.981 --> 00:38:36.910
lots of the enlightenment,

1819
00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:37.650
uh,

1820
00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:37.940
uh,

1821
00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:38.390
the work,

1822
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:41.290
the philosophic that could not be published in France were published in

1823
00:38:41.291 --> 00:38:43.060
Switzerland more about that another time.

1824
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.560
And in the Netherlands,

1825
00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:45.850
but they could lash out.

1826
00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:47.230
They lashed out at gay.

1827
00:38:47.231 --> 00:38:49.690
Sometimes they lashed out at Catholic sometimes,

1828
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.350
uh,

1829
00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:50.580
you know,

1830
00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:50.800
they,

1831
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.071
they,

1832
00:38:51.071 --> 00:38:54.790
there was an edge to them as if the whole thing could collapse on their heads.

1833
00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:57.760
This is Simon Schama is not the only person who'd made that point.

1834
00:38:57.761 --> 00:39:01.570
Others have as well pref because of the cause of the big floods.

1835
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:02.800
If the dike goes,

1836
00:39:02.801 --> 00:39:05.350
here's the image of the Dutch boy with his finger in the dyke,

1837
00:39:05.351 --> 00:39:06.310
if the dike goes,

1838
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.750
you are drowned.

1839
00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:08.500
Uh,

1840
00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:09.690
and there's this whole sense that,

1841
00:39:09.691 --> 00:39:09.871
that,

1842
00:39:09.871 --> 00:39:11.230
that the thing is precarious.

1843
00:39:11.231 --> 00:39:13.030
And you better kind of mind your mind,

1844
00:39:13.031 --> 00:39:15.100
your p's and q's or whatever the expression is.

1845
00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:15.790
Uh,

1846
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:15.970
and,

1847
00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:16.180
and,

1848
00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:16.411
and,

1849
00:39:16.411 --> 00:39:17.860
and act for a good,

1850
00:39:17.861 --> 00:39:18.381
very beat,

1851
00:39:18.381 --> 00:39:22.030
be a good person or this whole thing could kind of be literally flooded away.

1852
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:23.261
That whole different.

1853
00:39:23.261 --> 00:39:26.100
That is then this modest estate of y'all,

1854
00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:26.381
cy,

1855
00:39:26.381 --> 00:39:29.650
I've worked in the archives and just sigh in the smallest stables.

1856
00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:30.220
Uh,

1857
00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:30.401
you know,

1858
00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:31.500
this is one of my least favorite,

1859
00:39:31.501 --> 00:39:31.910
uh,

1860
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:32.160
uh,

1861
00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:32.993
a palaces,

1862
00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:33.551
but it's just,

1863
00:39:33.551 --> 00:39:33.731
I mean,

1864
00:39:33.731 --> 00:39:35.180
the way the Dutch thought about the settles,

1865
00:39:35.181 --> 00:39:38.200
there's a little different than the way that the French nobility or the Spanish

1866
00:39:38.201 --> 00:39:38.800
renewables,

1867
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.470
at least at the higher ranks thought about themselves as well.

1868
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:42.630
And I show these,

1869
00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:43.451
these are obvious,

1870
00:39:43.451 --> 00:39:45.670
but just to put them in comparison with which we'll see in the middle,

1871
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:47.260
a little modest bedroom,

1872
00:39:47.261 --> 00:39:48.700
they're in Versailles,

1873
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:50.380
uh,

1874
00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:50.910
while this is,

1875
00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:51.311
this is,

1876
00:39:51.311 --> 00:39:51.700
uh,

1877
00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:51.970
uh,

1878
00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:54.820
the war room is called a [inaudible] settle the gang.

1879
00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.080
Uh,

1880
00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.580
and I don't like just say what the hell.

1881
00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:58.740
And this is Volfi columns,

1882
00:39:58.750 --> 00:39:59.680
which is much more interesting.

1883
00:39:59.681 --> 00:40:00.910
I just put this in because I like it.

1884
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.850
But it shows you,

1885
00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:02.260
you know,

1886
00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:03.590
there are shot toes in,

1887
00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:05.110
there were chateaus in the Netherlands,

1888
00:40:05.111 --> 00:40:06.430
but they were mostly in the east.

1889
00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:09.040
There were nobles had the Chateau and,

1890
00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:10.270
and they didn't dominate.

1891
00:40:10.271 --> 00:40:11.170
They didn't rule.

1892
00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:11.830
Uh,

1893
00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:12.370
uh,

1894
00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:13.600
this vote of he called was,

1895
00:40:13.601 --> 00:40:14.321
it was fabulous.

1896
00:40:14.321 --> 00:40:18.070
And Louie the 14th was invited by his treasurer,

1897
00:40:18.071 --> 00:40:20.230
a man called foodK to go and eat there.

1898
00:40:20.231 --> 00:40:21.670
And he was insanely jealous.

1899
00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:22.130
Uh,

1900
00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:23.470
and they served him on,

1901
00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.220
uh,

1902
00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:27.400
on gold plates with gold silverware.

1903
00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:30.640
And he had huge pond stocked with not only fresh water fish,

1904
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:32.170
but saltwater fish.

1905
00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:33.850
And he was so jealous,

1906
00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.830
jealous that he threw him in the slam air,

1907
00:40:35.831 --> 00:40:37.930
threw him in jail and confiscated it.

1908
00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:38.470
But,

1909
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.761
but the,

1910
00:40:38.761 --> 00:40:39.040
the,

1911
00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:39.770
the image,

1912
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:41.290
it's just that this is very different.

1913
00:40:41.291 --> 00:40:42.940
And the paintings you found there were very different.

1914
00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:44.800
Here's Rembrandt himself.

1915
00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:45.723
Can we,

1916
00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:46.240
can you,

1917
00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.290
can you cut the light a little bit?

1918
00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.150
You know how to do that.

1919
00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:49.840
I'm,

1920
00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.530
there's somewhere,

1921
00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:51.730
there's a missing thing here.

1922
00:40:51.731 --> 00:40:52.421
It might be missing.

1923
00:40:52.421 --> 00:40:53.350
Thing might be in my head.

1924
00:40:53.351 --> 00:40:54.160
I don't know.

1925
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.350
But where the hell you do this thing?

1926
00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.170
Does anyone there know I'm going,

1927
00:40:59.171 --> 00:40:59.800
I don't know.

1928
00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:00.190
But,

1929
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:01.023
uh,

1930
00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:01.840
thanks.

1931
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.620
That was Rembrandt.

1932
00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:03.190
That was quick.

1933
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.821
But here's what,

1934
00:41:03.821 --> 00:41:04.210
just,

1935
00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:05.730
here's here.

1936
00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:06.830
He's still there.

1937
00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:07.030
He,

1938
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:08.830
he did about narcissism.

1939
00:41:08.831 --> 00:41:10.750
He did something like 70 self portraits.

1940
00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:12.550
He was his own favorite,

1941
00:41:12.551 --> 00:41:13.420
a a subject.

1942
00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.380
But Anyway,

1943
00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:15.213
um,

1944
00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:15.581
uh,

1945
00:41:15.581 --> 00:41:18.040
my mother tried to paint me but I never held still long enough.

1946
00:41:18.041 --> 00:41:21.250
And so there's only sort of two half of finished portraits of me.

1947
00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:21.910
But anyway,

1948
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:23.800
what did people paint roosdale this,

1949
00:41:23.801 --> 00:41:24.461
don't write this down,

1950
00:41:24.461 --> 00:41:25.480
but what you can if you want,

1951
00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:29.620
but go to the great museum in Amsterdam and see if the Rex Museum Rosedale

1952
00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:30.993
painted,

1953
00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:31.330
you know,

1954
00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:35.660
ordinary people living a and a at work.

1955
00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:36.350
Uh,

1956
00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:36.861
uh,

1957
00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:38.330
and this is the,

1958
00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:38.820
uh,

1959
00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:39.410
this is,

1960
00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:40.670
these are windmills obviously.

1961
00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:41.840
Um,

1962
00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:45.140
and hear windmills with people the same thing.

1963
00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:45.861
But this is,

1964
00:41:45.861 --> 00:41:48.320
if you wouldn't find these sorts of generally these,

1965
00:41:48.321 --> 00:41:49.470
these kinds of paintings in,

1966
00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:50.050
in,

1967
00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:51.050
in other places.

1968
00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.070
This is a painter called phones house,

1969
00:41:53.071 --> 00:41:53.430
h a.

1970
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:54.020
L.

1971
00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:54.260
S.

1972
00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:54.650
Uh,

1973
00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:55.730
it's a family scene.

1974
00:41:55.731 --> 00:41:58.490
These are middle class people having paintings,

1975
00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.130
commissioning paintings of themselves.

1976
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:01.551
You know,

1977
00:42:01.551 --> 00:42:02.301
it's the equivalent of,

1978
00:42:02.301 --> 00:42:03.830
of sort of fancy patricians in,

1979
00:42:03.831 --> 00:42:06.230
in Florence having paintings of themselves,

1980
00:42:06.231 --> 00:42:09.680
but they're from a very different social class is the patricians and Florence

1981
00:42:09.681 --> 00:42:11.060
were or Venice.

1982
00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:12.000
Uh,

1983
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.280
and so it's just,

1984
00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:14.540
this is sort of the sets of same,

1985
00:42:14.541 --> 00:42:15.650
I love still lives,

1986
00:42:15.651 --> 00:42:17.150
especially if they have food and wine.

1987
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:18.410
And this is how this is,

1988
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:21.410
there's some wine up there and this is a batter class.

1989
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:22.220
Uh,

1990
00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.860
probably mispronounce Cla as c.

1991
00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:25.580
Uh,

1992
00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:26.390
and this is still life.

1993
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:27.320
They paint food,

1994
00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:27.950
they fade,

1995
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:28.251
paint,

1996
00:42:28.251 --> 00:42:30.560
food and people eating and people having fun,

1997
00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:32.210
not people at war.

1998
00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:32.690
Uh,

1999
00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:33.290
and not,

2000
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:33.650
uh,

2001
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:34.041
people,

2002
00:42:34.041 --> 00:42:37.220
not that those services to 18th century paintings of the inevitable paintings of

2003
00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:39.710
the British nobles or land,

2004
00:42:39.711 --> 00:42:40.550
Big Gentry,

2005
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:41.090
uh,

2006
00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:41.990
looking over the,

2007
00:42:41.991 --> 00:42:46.550
all of the villages they've had knocked down so they could expand their hunting

2008
00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:47.741
a terrain or,

2009
00:42:47.741 --> 00:42:47.830
or,

2010
00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:48.160
or,

2011
00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:51.530
or funneling the nose of their killer hunting dogs or something like that.

2012
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:54.410
It's just a very different way of imagining oneself.

2013
00:42:54.411 --> 00:42:54.741
And I mean,

2014
00:42:54.741 --> 00:42:55.461
it's very attractive.

2015
00:42:55.461 --> 00:42:56.294
I must find that very,

2016
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:57.290
very attractive.

2017
00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:58.460
This is the village school.

2018
00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:02.360
They had the highest literacy rate in the world period.

2019
00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:03.080
Uh,

2020
00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.700
the Dutch did a very,

2021
00:43:04.701 --> 00:43:07.430
very ordinary people and there were poor people in the Netherlands.

2022
00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:08.301
Nonetheless,

2023
00:43:08.301 --> 00:43:09.140
we're very ordinary,

2024
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:09.650
uh,

2025
00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:10.790
literate poor people.

2026
00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.800
And there's something to be said for that.

2027
00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.210
And I like cats a lot.

2028
00:43:14.211 --> 00:43:14.721
I hate dogs.

2029
00:43:14.721 --> 00:43:15.161
But anyways,

2030
00:43:15.161 --> 00:43:15.994
so this is just a,

2031
00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:16.490
you know,

2032
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:18.140
children playing with a cat.

2033
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:23.430
My cat yesterday actually undid my password last night of I Yale Password.

2034
00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:27.380
I saw the thing I said it said Password and next I knew she had literally typed

2035
00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.090
it really dedicated my password.

2036
00:43:29.091 --> 00:43:29.541
I put a new one.

2037
00:43:29.541 --> 00:43:31.250
There's nothing to do with anyone so should take this out.

2038
00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:31.970
But anyway,

2039
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:32.803
uh,

2040
00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:33.710
cat,

2041
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:34.220
there I go.

2042
00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:34.790
Or boom,

2043
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:38.540
this is what we do in the south of France was a little Sheldon in Yakutia we

2044
00:43:38.541 --> 00:43:38.741
put,

2045
00:43:38.741 --> 00:43:39.491
we play boule the,

2046
00:43:39.491 --> 00:43:39.771
you know,

2047
00:43:39.771 --> 00:43:40.100
you don't,

2048
00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:41.060
it's not quite the same thing.

2049
00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:44.510
That's like bace we have this sort of metal ball and that's another for another

2050
00:43:44.511 --> 00:43:44.811
lecture.

2051
00:43:44.811 --> 00:43:45.490
But anyway,

2052
00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:46.323
uh,

2053
00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:47.183
you don't have a lot of that.

2054
00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.080
Uh,

2055
00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.150
but see these are ordinary people having fun.

2056
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:51.860
Here they are.

2057
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:54.500
Here they are having fun.

2058
00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:56.030
Yeah.

2059
00:43:56.030 --> 00:44:00.260
But see there they're having too much fun and this is part of the point because

2060
00:44:00.261 --> 00:44:04.910
part of this certain veteran Calvinism and part of the kind of fact that that

2061
00:44:04.911 --> 00:44:09.911
what if the dams burst or what if the British begin to outdo us in the World

2062
00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:16.810
Trade Department or what if the French come and squish us like grapes.

2063
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:22.610
There's always this sense of vulnerability and behind the paintings of people

2064
00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:27.740
eating the theme of people eating or praying prayers at mealtime and this sort

2065
00:44:27.741 --> 00:44:29.500
of thing or playing boon,

2066
00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:29.871
you know,

2067
00:44:29.871 --> 00:44:30.950
pay Tom Bochy.

2068
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.200
There's always this sense of the rivaled family.

2069
00:44:34.201 --> 00:44:35.670
That's what this is called by stain.

2070
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:36.960
S.

2071
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:36.960
T.

2072
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:36.960
E.

2073
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:37.680
N that,

2074
00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:38.070
uh,

2075
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:40.350
that if you have too much fun things,

2076
00:44:40.351 --> 00:44:41.310
we'll get away from you.

2077
00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:42.960
And these people are all,

2078
00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:43.331
all,

2079
00:44:43.331 --> 00:44:46.680
all drinking and leaving these poor little children to their own device.

2080
00:44:46.681 --> 00:44:49.890
And they may be knocking down one or two of themselves there because nobody's

2081
00:44:49.891 --> 00:44:50.940
paying any attention.

2082
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:56.210
You could go too far and then you end up like this.

2083
00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.400
And then how does it all end up in the long run?

2084
00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:00.271
Well,

2085
00:45:00.271 --> 00:45:03.810
how it ends up in the long run for the Dutch is that the Dutch cease to be a

2086
00:45:03.811 --> 00:45:04.644
great power,

2087
00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:06.240
but there's nothing wrong with that.

2088
00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:10.800
They'll go on to live highly prosperous lives.

2089
00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:11.640
Uh,

2090
00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.770
they eventually end up with a monarchy.

2091
00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:14.310
Uh,

2092
00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:17.280
they eventually lose Belgium in 1831.

2093
00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:17.910
Uh,

2094
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:18.743
they basically,

2095
00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:19.740
I didn't care,

2096
00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:20.101
uh,

2097
00:45:20.101 --> 00:45:24.210
the Dutch economy rather than the equivalent would be the Venetians of the

2098
00:45:24.211 --> 00:45:25.380
decline of the Venetian,

2099
00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:26.090
uh,

2100
00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:26.370
uh,

2101
00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:28.350
economic power in the Mediterranean,

2102
00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:28.800
uh,

2103
00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:28.981
in,

2104
00:45:28.981 --> 00:45:30.270
in try a trade with,

2105
00:45:30.271 --> 00:45:30.780
uh,

2106
00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:31.050
uh,

2107
00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:31.950
with the east.

2108
00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:32.520
Uh,

2109
00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:33.690
it diminishes,

2110
00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:34.690
uh,

2111
00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:35.523
uh,

2112
00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:40.050
the Netherlands a thesis to be a great power,

2113
00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:41.040
whereas England,

2114
00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:41.580
uh,

2115
00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:42.870
becomes in Britain has,

2116
00:45:42.871 --> 00:45:45.390
it becomes in 1707 becomes a,

2117
00:45:45.391 --> 00:45:47.490
the biggest of the world powers.

2118
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:50.820
But let us still remember these six factors are seven,

2119
00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:51.900
her many I had up there.

2120
00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.420
And remember what these two places had in common.

2121
00:45:54.421 --> 00:45:56.010
It has a lot to do with the global trade,

2122
00:45:56.011 --> 00:45:57.450
has a lot to do with social structure,

2123
00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:59.340
has a lot to do with,

2124
00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:02.130
with who they thought they were,

2125
00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:03.600
the paintings they bought,

2126
00:46:03.601 --> 00:46:04.860
the paintings they commissioned,

2127
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.540
the way they viewed themselves.

2128
00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:07.320
Uh,

2129
00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:12.320
and part of this re constructing of national identity often has as much to do

2130
00:46:12.991 --> 00:46:13.950
with who you're not,

2131
00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:15.690
not absolute,

2132
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:17.100
not Catholic,

2133
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.490
not French as it does with,

2134
00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:21.120
you know,

2135
00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:24.330
with who you imagine yourself to be.

2136
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:25.460
And in the growth of,

2137
00:46:25.461 --> 00:46:26.640
of national awareness,

2138
00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.890
that itself is an important theme.

2139
00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:30.300
Have a great weekend.

2140
00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:31.320
See you on Monday.
