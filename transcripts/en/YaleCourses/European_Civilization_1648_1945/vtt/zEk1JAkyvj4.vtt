1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.640
You don't want him dressed up because,
uh,
you know,
I,

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.360
when I do this course and when I do the first half of their French course,

3
00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:10.080
I do a lecture on the bourgeoisie,

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.040
the middle classes and middleclass there's a form of a self identity that was

5
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:21.270
constructed in a way being a worker was constructed or being a noble.

6
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.100
And one day I was about to come off and go out,
you know,

7
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.500
I'll go out among you all and talk about Dmea and show you some dummy,

8
00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:32.910
a slides about the bourgeoisie.
And my wife said to me,

9
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.430
you can't go talk about the bush.
Was he looking like you usually do.

10
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.700
You got to look like you mean it,

11
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.440
like you have a vague sense of knowing it.
And so as a result,

12
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.600
look at this.
So I wear this about once a year.
You know,
unfortunately,
you know,

13
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:55.890
I wear to funerals and last time I wore was uh,
uh,
something.

14
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.670
Bill Clinton had a through mutual friends.
Uh,

15
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.290
and I only have one tie that I share with my son and,
and uh,

16
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.610
we had to find them another son.
Uh,
another a tie underneath the soccer shoes.

17
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.810
And um,
then we got into New York and went to this party and we're all dolled up,

18
00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:16.440
you know,
and all that.
And then we went out to a restaurant,
I lost my tie,

19
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.280
my one tie and the last time I bought a tie like ties cost $15.

20
00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:24.390
And then so I in Ann Arbor I bought a tie for,
this is $75 tie.

21
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.930
So this is my only tight.
So that's a long way of answering your question,

22
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:31.800
but why I look like this today,
but I hope to make some sense of that,
you know,

23
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.980
in,
in the lecture.
So thank you very much.
I didn't set that question up.

24
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:39.810
Did I didn't ask you please,
please ask that question.
But,
but,

25
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:42.990
but I want you,
you know,
when you're looking at me dress,
it's not Halloween.

26
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.170
That's the first thing I thought.
When you're looking at me dressed like this,

27
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.970
please try to think knowing me a little bit as you do.

28
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.740
Why was that?

29
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:57.741
It meant a lot to dress like this in the 19th century because the middleclass

30
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.480
has started dressing like this and the 19th century dark with a little bit of

31
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:10.290
color.
And when you see dome,
Yay are you see Della quads famous,

32
00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:12.510
which I forgot the slide,
Liberty League and the people.

33
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.470
And you see that we're the bourgeois.
There was top hat,

34
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.000
he's dressed in a bourgeois uni like this.
And so,
uh,

35
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:24.060
that emerges out of the bourgeois century.

36
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.630
And so while last time we talked about class,

37
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.940
the construction of class identity for ordinary people,
for working people,
uh,

38
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.500
the abortion with he had,
has had a strongest sense of self as a,

39
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:42.480
of self identity as any social class you could imagine.
And it was his all,

40
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:44.280
I'll make the point in a minute.
It was,

41
00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:48.210
it was a difficult to get into that class if you weren't born into it,
but it,

42
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.310
and,
and,
and it was,
uh,

43
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.630
the fear of falling out of it with something that,
that helps,
uh,
uh,

44
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.560
helps motivate lots of political things in the 19th century.
Uh,

45
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:02.830
and the 19th century in terms of,
of being the bourgeois century.

46
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:06.190
One of the things you see in,
in,
um,
in countries,

47
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:10.450
particularly in western Europe and Great Britain,
in,
in France,
uh,

48
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.720
and in Germany and in Italy,
as you see in the middle classes,

49
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.940
wanting the political power that commensurate with their economic status.

50
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.330
I,
and if in the 18th century,
I mean,

51
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:26.020
this is one of those truisms that happens to be true and can be exaggerated.

52
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.270
But if you know the aristocracy,
you're born into the aristocracy.
If you get,

53
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:32.980
if you hit the big time and you get lucky,

54
00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:37.570
you can buy your way in thanks to the baroque French monarchy.
Uh,
but,

55
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.870
uh,
the ideal Aristocrat,
uh,

56
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:45.070
and this was what [inaudible] would have talked about,

57
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.830
about him or herself,
uh,
was born into,
uh,
uh,

58
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.520
the aristocracy through blood,
uh,
through family.
Uh,

59
00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:59.470
it wasn't a cheap,
I mean,
ascribed status.
And in the 19th century,

60
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:04.060
one of the things that happens with the French revolution and with Napoleon I is

61
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:09.061
that the middle class person seemed and middleclass values,

62
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.790
uh,
seem to be something to be emulated.

63
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.610
And once we've got an increase in,

64
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.560
in the wealth of the middle classes and the diversity and complexity that I'll

65
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:23.490
talk about in a minute,
then you wanted to political power,

66
00:04:23.491 --> 00:04:25.570
he one the right to vote,
you wanted access to,

67
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.440
to information through the press and the print culture.

68
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.840
All of these things are closely tied to the middle classes.

69
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.380
So that's what I'm going to talk about today.
Uh,

70
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.210
most of it is about the bourgeois culture.
Uh,
and so that's why I'm,

71
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.160
I'm dressed dressed like this,

72
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:45.190
and I assure you that the minute this lecture is over,

73
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.810
I will go back and like,
like I could never compare myself to Clark Kent,

74
00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:54.460
but I will find my phone booth and change back into normal,
normal duds.

75
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.710
So let's talk a little bit about the,
uh,
about the middle class,
uh,

76
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:02.650
in,
in the bourgeois,
uh,

77
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:06.940
in the bourgeois a century now.
Uh,

78
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.500
the middle classes or the Boers was z,
uh,

79
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:15.720
in our terms that we conveniently use a marks,
you know,
talked about the wars,

80
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.020
was he as being as extremely homogenous class.
Uh,

81
00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:24.940
in fact,
the word bourgeois has really more cultural connotations maybe then,
uh,

82
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:28.510
then,
um,
objectives or social categorization,

83
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.940
a living bourgeois in a bourgeois manner.

84
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.830
And we'll see some aspects of that in terms of private access to private space,

85
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.720
uh,
uh,
middleclass concept of childhood,
uh,
and that sort of thing.

86
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.990
So middle classes is probably a better term.

87
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.030
A bourgeois is equivalent of burger a middle classes is probably for our point

88
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:53.230
of view,
uh,
a better term.
It seems other odd to be talking about that,
you know,

89
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:58.070
the English,
uh,
uh,
Bush was z of leads of what,
about which there's,

90
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.670
but there's an excellent book.
Ah,
eh,
because bourgeois after all is a,

91
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:04.830
it started out as a,
as a French word,
but in,
in,

92
00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:09.080
in using an Indian insisting on the term middle classes,
what I'm suggesting,

93
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.110
I is the enormous complexity of the middle class.

94
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.350
There wasn't just one middleclass yet.

95
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.930
Yet the middleclass is shared some,
you know,

96
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.240
cultural values and symbols,
uh,
in common.

97
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:24.620
And,
uh,

98
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.950
when challenged by ordinary people could snap back,

99
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.620
uh,
in an extremely cohesive,
cohesive,
uh,

100
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.650
class based manner and marks,
uh,
had some of that,

101
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.970
um,
quite,
uh,
quite,
uh,
correctly.
Now I'm

102
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.100
in a Parisian newspaper called,
there's,

103
00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:52.340
you're not that day they bought in 1847,

104
00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:55.660
someone actually did a pretty damn good job of describing the bourgeoisie.

105
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.280
The bourgeoisie is not a class.

106
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.280
The person argued it isn't a position.

107
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.820
One inquires that position and when loses it work thrift and ability confer it,

108
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.050
he argued,
referring to himself.
Of course,

109
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.440
vice dissipation and idleness mean that it can be lost.

110
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.390
Um,
and so that old kind of,
uh,
aristocratic,

111
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.770
uh,
ethos of not working,
of being idle,
uh,

112
00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:31.760
although it can be exaggerated as we've seen in the 17th and 18th century,

113
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.550
nonetheless,
there was something,
uh,
to it,
it,
you know,

114
00:07:34.551 --> 00:07:39.170
an 18th century noble let his fingernails grow long,
uh,

115
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.970
as sort of just hung out showing,
uh,
his,

116
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:47.510
uh,
his a good taste to by living in,

117
00:07:47.511 --> 00:07:51.200
in an idle aristocratic,
uh,
uh,
manner.
Uh,

118
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:56.240
the bourgeoise he did anything but that work was part of how they believed to

119
00:07:58.581 --> 00:08:03.440
get ahead.
And I'm getting ahead is what they wanted to do.
Now,

120
00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:07.150
the French revolution,
and here's an important point,
I guess,
um,

121
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:12.190
open the way by removing legal blocks in very many places to the career,

122
00:08:14.271 --> 00:08:19.250
open to talents.
And Napoleon used to say,
say tediously,
uh,
that,

123
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.500
uh,
in each,
uh,
soldiers backpack,

124
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:25.880
there was a Marshall's by tall or staff that you could get promoted with,

125
00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:30.040
with good work,
hard work if you didn't get your head blown off,
uh,

126
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.630
in one of these battles.
Uh,

127
00:08:32.631 --> 00:08:34.790
but certainly one of the things that comes out of his,

128
00:08:34.791 --> 00:08:37.680
his insistence on service to the state,
uh,

129
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:42.560
is creating a whole series of rewards that,
uh,

130
00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:47.270
that,
uh,
recompensed a virtuous action and hard work.
I mean,

131
00:08:47.271 --> 00:08:49.260
that's what the lady who owned a donor,

132
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:54.380
the legion of honor was all about and making money with part of it.

133
00:08:54.441 --> 00:08:57.700
And of course it's,
it's always,
uh,
in the 19th century.
Would,

134
00:08:57.701 --> 00:09:01.560
what sort of classic to poke fun at it?
Bourgeois culture in some cases,

135
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.940
the lack of it.
Uh,
and,
and,
and to,
uh,

136
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:07.350
ascribe to the middle classes,
uh,

137
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.420
sort of Philistine habits in which making money was really the only thing that

138
00:09:11.421 --> 00:09:15.900
that counted.
Now,
certainly Friedrich Engels Marx as partner,

139
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.940
uh,
uh,
obsessed with the as well,
he should have been with the slums of,
of,
uh,

140
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.990
the satanic mills of Manchester.
He wants,
uh,
uh,
wrote the following.
He says,

141
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:25.770
one day I wrote,

142
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:29.700
I walked with one of these middleclass gentlemen in demand Chester.

143
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.890
I spoke to him about the disgraceful,

144
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:35.940
unhealthy slums and drew his attention to the disgusting condition of that part

145
00:09:35.941 --> 00:09:38.520
of town in which the factory workers lived.

146
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.840
I declared that I'd never seen so badly built a town in my life.
He listened,

147
00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:44.490
listened patiently,
uh,

148
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.180
and at the end of the corner of a street at which we parted,
he remarked,

149
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:52.110
and yet there is a good deal of money to be made here.
Good morning sir.

150
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.400
And he walked away.

151
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:57.330
One employer wrote in the 1830s that that uh,

152
00:09:57.331 --> 00:10:01.410
relative to the work to his workers is that the worker,
quote unquote,

153
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:05.820
I couldn't invent this should be constantly harassed by need a four,

154
00:10:05.821 --> 00:10:08.400
then he will not set his children a bad example.

155
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:13.550
And his poverty will be the guarantee of good behavior.

156
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.130
Now of course,
this is,
you know,
this is the character of,

157
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.620
of middleclass self absorbed and of,
of narcissism,
of,

158
00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:27.570
of kind of this and veteran cruelty to,
uh,
to the classes below them.

159
00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:28.860
On the other hand,
I mean,

160
00:10:28.861 --> 00:10:32.150
the more we study the middle classes and then the 1960s people were leaving to

161
00:10:32.151 --> 00:10:36.270
study in the middle classes because I didn't like them very much.
Uh,
you know,

162
00:10:36.271 --> 00:10:37.500
they studied workers,
but,

163
00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:41.000
but there's been an awful lot of good work done on the middle classes.

164
00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:45.330
Among my dear friend Peter Gay has five volumes,
uh,

165
00:10:45.331 --> 00:10:47.680
of the bourgeois century.
Uh,

166
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:51.930
take on the idea that the middleclass lived without passion.
Uh,
uh,

167
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:56.730
and,
uh,
we're,
we're Philistines and that sort of thing.

168
00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.120
And the more we look at the middle class now,
we,
we,
we see certainly that,

169
00:11:00.121 --> 00:11:03.480
that no matter where you look,
that there are a,

170
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:07.170
one of the things the middleclass people did was form voluntary associations,

171
00:11:07.171 --> 00:11:11.550
voluntary associations.
Aristocrats didn't form voluntary associations.

172
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.910
They didn't need to.
The middleclass form voluntary associations,

173
00:11:14.911 --> 00:11:19.760
and many of these refer extremely charitable purposes,
uh,
particularly in,
um,

174
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.480
in,
in Britain.
I mean,
again,

175
00:11:21.481 --> 00:11:24.400
the study that I referred to by somebody called Morris,
uh,

176
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.850
I think it's Morris on leads,
uh,

177
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:30.720
chose to kind of richness and depth to these voluntary associations in which

178
00:11:30.721 --> 00:11:35.700
people try to do,
uh,
to do an awful lot for ordinary people.

179
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:39.750
Uh,
and,
uh,
you know,
it,
it has a sense of moralizing.

180
00:11:39.751 --> 00:11:43.020
There's always this sort of top down look about moralizing them,

181
00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:45.960
trying to get the,
the workers to,
to drink less,

182
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.620
trying to get them to go to church,
uh,
trying to get their them to,
uh,

183
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.950
when it was possible for their children's is to become educated in the stay in

184
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:54.431
school.

185
00:11:54.431 --> 00:11:58.150
And there's always this tension between families who needed children's income,

186
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:03.400
however small that was,
and across the 19th century,
uh,

187
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.990
over very long period,
uh,
uh,
laws.
Uh,
finally,

188
00:12:07.991 --> 00:12:11.130
by the end of the century in,
in,
in,
in,
in most places,
making,
uh,

189
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:16.030
at least primary education,
uh,
obligatory and in most cases,
uh,

190
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.510
free.
Um,
you know,
I mean,
here's a ridiculous example.

191
00:12:19.511 --> 00:12:21.460
It's not a ridiculous example.
If you love animals,
I mean,

192
00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:22.810
I'm a cat person and as I already said,

193
00:12:22.811 --> 00:12:25.690
but this is Heidi for the protection of cruelty to animals.
I mean,

194
00:12:25.691 --> 00:12:28.490
these sorts of organizations,
uh,
really,
you know,

195
00:12:28.491 --> 00:12:32.230
we're one of the classic examples of bourgeois voluntary associations.
I mean,

196
00:12:32.231 --> 00:12:33.100
doing good things.

197
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.000
They also get together to hang out with each other and sort of,
uh,
uh,

198
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.960
try to gauge who has more money than the other and they get together for social

199
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:45.520
reasons and the coffee houses of England and,
and,
and,
uh,
in the voluntary,

200
00:12:45.521 --> 00:12:48.130
the clubs,
the circles you call them in France,

201
00:12:48.131 --> 00:12:53.110
and then their equivalents in Germany and Italy and in Spain.

202
00:12:53.111 --> 00:12:57.970
But,
but,
uh,
uh,
one of the more,
more,
uh,
ludicrous,
uh,

203
00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.090
kind of,
uh,
Devi,
well,
we call it Divya,
uh,

204
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.900
a model of one of the,
uh,

205
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.490
society for the protection of cruelty to animals was,

206
00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:11.230
and one of the organizations in France has said,
one must love animals,

207
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.710
but not fraternize with animals.
I don't know what that means,

208
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.340
but the main thing is that they want it to save a animals from,
uh,

209
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:22.690
from being beaten,
almost beaten to death and in many cases of horses.
And,

210
00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:23.840
and you can see how in,

211
00:13:23.841 --> 00:13:27.220
in places in which bull fighting over the long run in the 19th and 20th century,

212
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.580
such as the south,
very south of France and in Spain,

213
00:13:30.581 --> 00:13:33.310
there were always movements to try to,
you know,
protect the bowls were,

214
00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:36.510
seems like a very,
uh,
reasonable,
uh,
thing to do.
So,
uh,

215
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.820
for all of those are bad press that the middleclass has had and you can read

216
00:13:39.821 --> 00:13:43.090
some of this bad press and what you're reading or there was also this good side

217
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:47.200
that that should be a evoked as well.
Um,
um,

218
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:48.783
that's a period.

219
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.050
And then certainly in terms of organized religion,

220
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:54.310
uh,

221
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:59.160
the middleclass goes to church more than ordinary people,
uh,

222
00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:03.100
then,
then,
then workers,
uh,
for sure.
And in the case of,
of peasants,

223
00:14:03.101 --> 00:14:06.520
it depends on where,
because as I said before,
in many parts of France,

224
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.270
the example that some,
well studied,
you still had this deep Christianization,

225
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.740
but certainly religion was a fundamental part of,

226
00:14:13.741 --> 00:14:18.440
of the British middleclass as view of itself.
Uh,
and this,

227
00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:22.180
the percentage of people who went to church could of course be exaggerated.

228
00:14:22.181 --> 00:14:25.400
There was a study in,
in all of England,
uh,

229
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:26.980
I don't think it was in Wales and Scotland,

230
00:14:26.981 --> 00:14:30.040
but in at least it was an England maybe in Wales to probably in wheels as well.

231
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:35.370
I think it was in the 1851 where they decided to look at every single church in,

232
00:14:35.381 --> 00:14:39.970
in,
in England and Wales,
let's say,
and to see how many people went to church.

233
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:43.990
And they found to their horror that it was less than that than they thought.

234
00:14:43.991 --> 00:14:47.890
And they also discovered that if,
uh,
if everybody had wanted to go to church,

235
00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:51.830
had gone to various churches,
Methodists from ordinary people,

236
00:14:51.831 --> 00:14:56.570
Anglican Catholic,
uh,
for the Irish and for a certain minority of,
of,

237
00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.020
of,
of,
uh,
of,

238
00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:03.070
of British citizens or Jews in the east and going to synagogue and the east end

239
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.060
of London that there wouldn't have been,

240
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.010
they couldn't have accommodated all these people.

241
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:11.160
So there's a massive kind of church building campaign that go,

242
00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.990
that has its counterpart in,
in almost every country as well.
Certainly in France.

243
00:15:14.991 --> 00:15:17.000
After the Paris commune of 1871,

244
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.920
they start building churches in working class districts perched on the edge of,

245
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:26.750
uh,
of cities.
More about that in another lecture.
But,
but certainly,
I mean,

246
00:15:26.751 --> 00:15:29.990
one go on and on about this,
but certainly religion for the middle classes has a,

247
00:15:29.991 --> 00:15:34.130
has a much a greater role in their life.
Then in,
uh,

248
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:35.300
um,
uh,

249
00:15:35.301 --> 00:15:39.880
then in working class working class cities and in the case of the peasants with

250
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:41.390
worn any peasants left in England.

251
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.190
And I'll talk about that and it'll be fun to talk about,
uh,

252
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:48.440
one of these lectures.
Uh,
but,
uh,
anyway,
uh,
there we go.

253
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:53.300
Now how many people were,
would have considered themselves middleclass and again,

254
00:15:53.301 --> 00:15:56.630
self identity,
how people thought of themselves,
uh,

255
00:15:56.631 --> 00:16:01.310
is one of those,
um,
aspects that we want to,

256
00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:06.140
uh,
we'll want to discuss.
Um,
how do we know?
I mean,

257
00:16:06.141 --> 00:16:08.110
how would you know,
uh,

258
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:12.740
who is middleclass when they first start doing censuses and census is a really

259
00:16:12.741 --> 00:16:16.130
are 19th century phenomenon.
They begin with what and subsequent centuries.

260
00:16:16.131 --> 00:16:20.180
As I said before,
there were only the first sentence is in Copenhagen,
I think.

261
00:16:20.181 --> 00:16:23.100
And,
and,
uh,
uh,
in the 18th century,
uh,

262
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.690
the first real censuses don't do not come until the 19th century,

263
00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.490
almost everywhere.
I mean,
it didn't ask people,
are you,
uh,

264
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.650
they asked you your name and where you lived.
Uh,
they,

265
00:16:33.651 --> 00:16:36.080
in some cases they ask you your profession,
but they did not say,

266
00:16:36.081 --> 00:16:38.780
are you middleclass are you not middle class?
Uh,

267
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.830
so there was a whole lot of work done in the 1970s and what they used to call

268
00:16:42.831 --> 00:16:44.210
the new urban history,

269
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.470
which is sort of counting people up and deciding who might well have considered

270
00:16:48.471 --> 00:16:50.930
themselves a middle class.
Um,

271
00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.390
there are a lot of dissertations written on that kind of thing.

272
00:16:53.391 --> 00:16:54.650
There was one in the case of Paris,

273
00:16:54.651 --> 00:16:57.020
I never really have to talk to someone about Paris because the work is so rich

274
00:16:57.021 --> 00:16:58.480
there.
A woman called Adeline,

275
00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:02.130
Doma wrote a dissertation that was felt to published called the Bush White House

276
00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.810
[inaudible],
the bourgeois of Paris and the first half of the 19th century.

277
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.770
And so,
um,
what she did is she looked at,
at wills,

278
00:17:09.771 --> 00:17:13.910
the middle class people had enough money to leave wills,
uh,
and,

279
00:17:13.911 --> 00:17:17.240
and therefore their inventories after death.
That's what,
what you call them,

280
00:17:17.241 --> 00:17:18.440
inventories after death.

281
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:21.950
And that's one of the reasons we know about the explosion of print culture

282
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.440
because they inventory the books that people read.

283
00:17:24.441 --> 00:17:27.220
I mentioned this in the context of,
of enlightenment to,

284
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:32.150
because you do have that too,
but,
uh,
taking the kinds of way that she looked,

285
00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:35.120
ways that she looked at social class.
Um,

286
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:40.210
she determined that somewhere between 17 and 19% of the prison population in the

287
00:17:41.361 --> 00:17:46.361
first half of the 19th century would have been considered considered bourgeois

288
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:52.150
and would have considered themselves bourgeois.
That is in the middle class,

289
00:17:52.151 --> 00:17:56.460
says now,
certainly in,
in Britain,
the percentage is higher.

290
00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:02.190
It probably approaches 25%.
I can't remember the exact figures.

291
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:04.090
Um,
and,

292
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:08.280
and that percent will continue to increase in the 19th century.

293
00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.970
And you can already very well anticipate from you already know where other parts

294
00:18:11.971 --> 00:18:15.090
of Europe that have have large,
important middle classes,

295
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:20.070
the old Hanseatic port cities of German and the German freeze to cities that

296
00:18:20.071 --> 00:18:23.190
would become part of unified Germany in 1871.
Uh,

297
00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:28.200
and in northern German cities in general,
light like,
uh,
uh,
uh,
Bremen and,

298
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:32.610
and,
and,
and uh,
and Lubeck and Homburg above all they have,
I mean,

299
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:37.350
homburgs a huge port city,
so it's got the very normous wars was the,
uh,

300
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.650
you know,
you,
if you went to Madrid,
you'd find a sizable middle class,

301
00:18:40.651 --> 00:18:45.390
but it would be nothing that you would have a,
if you compared to Madrid to,

302
00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.020
um,

303
00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:51.000
to Barcelona because Barcelona is a really natural economy based upon,
uh,

304
00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:55.200
important economic relations between its hinterland and Barcelona and between

305
00:18:55.201 --> 00:18:57.330
Barcelona and the world because it's a major port.

306
00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:02.040
So you've got this big teaming middleclass there as well.
Um,

307
00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.470
and,
uh,
you know,
in the case of France,
I mean,

308
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.770
obviously places that have lots of industry have,
have,
you know,

309
00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:12.480
I had small businesses have middle class people,
uh,
uh,
in,
in large numbers.

310
00:19:12.481 --> 00:19:15.760
So not as large numbers as workers.
I mean,
Leon would be a good example.
I mean,

311
00:19:15.761 --> 00:19:19.830
Leo has the most tightly closed middleclass as you can imagine.
It still is.

312
00:19:19.831 --> 00:19:23.760
I mean,
all,
it was very,
very [inaudible].
Uh,
what can wouldn't say.
Uh,
and again,

313
00:19:23.761 --> 00:19:27.360
northern Italy,
you find a huge vibrant middle class,
but not in southern Italy.

314
00:19:27.361 --> 00:19:31.500
I mean,
uh,
Naples is one of the biggest cities,
uh,
in,
in Europe,
uh,

315
00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.020
right through the early modern period.
And you've got a large middle class,

316
00:19:34.021 --> 00:19:37.130
but most of Italy is a extremely rural.
And what you have,

317
00:19:37.131 --> 00:19:41.040
what you had in Rome with was,
uh,
you had clergy enrollment,
but you hate you.

318
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.630
It's a city.
So we've got important middle class.

319
00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:45.900
The further east you get the smallest,
the middleclass a smaller,

320
00:19:45.901 --> 00:19:50.901
the middle class gets a Russia that the estimates are about 2% of the population

321
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:55.530
are,
uh,
we're,
we're middleclass 2%,
which isn't very much at all.
And of course,

322
00:19:55.531 --> 00:19:59.810
they are clustered in Moscow and in Saint Petersburg,
uh,

323
00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:03.540
and in Kiev.
Now,
Ukraine,
uh,
always Ukraine,

324
00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:06.690
but then part of a part of Russia,
uh,

325
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.960
in the large cities in Poland,
Warsaw,
I had a large,

326
00:20:09.961 --> 00:20:14.250
I was just at the history museum and fascinating one a of Warsaw Museum,

327
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:18.890
um,
uh,
a couple months ago and in Warsaw as Krakoff ha ha,

328
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.130
Krakow had Krakoff ha had a big middle class.
Uh,

329
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.150
Gdansk obviously cause it was a port city,

330
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:28.230
but much of Poland was rural and wouldn't have that kind of,
uh,
uh,

331
00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:32.310
Middleclass Belgrade would,
would've been the only city in the Balkans,

332
00:20:32.311 --> 00:20:35.790
outside of his Tan bull with a and envelope assembles and in the Balkans.

333
00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.760
But what with uh,
uh,
with,
uh,
an important middle class.
I mean,

334
00:20:38.761 --> 00:20:43.050
this is all perfectly obvious anyway.
Who are these folks and what do they want?

335
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.980
Um,
so I mean,
they're not all,
how am I going to do this?
I'm going to,

336
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:48.910
can I need those fights?
I'm gonna do it like this.

337
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.540
You have to imagine the middleclass like this,

338
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.460
that it's a pyramid.

339
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:59.790
It's a pyramid with a small top and a big bottom.
Uh,

340
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:03.580
and that,
and I'll give you some rather interesting,
um,
um,

341
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.820
show you a lithograph that really represents this.
Two of these in very,

342
00:21:06.821 --> 00:21:10.900
in very interesting ways.
I think a,
a compelling ways at the beginning,

343
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:15.100
at the very top.
And this,
you know,
if you take a think of a Zurich or think of,

344
00:21:15.101 --> 00:21:17.680
I mean,
any city you want,
I mean,
Zurich has a big middle class.

345
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:22.660
So the Geneva for obvious reasons,
uh,
but the very top there are the,
the,
the,
the,

346
00:21:22.661 --> 00:21:26.440
the,
the,
the great bourgeoisie,
the,
the big boars was,

347
00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:31.390
and these are people who have,
who are big finance,
Sears,
uh,
in the 19th century,

348
00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:35.130
bankers will become much more important for perfectly obvious reasons.
Uh,

349
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:38.680
these are big wholesale merchants,
uh,

350
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:42.970
who are making bundle shipping things from here to there.

351
00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:46.220
You won't get fine lawyers and people like that.
Um,

352
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.550
and what also makes them the high bourgeoisie or the Big Boys?

353
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.390
Was he a small percentage?
It doesn't really matter.
Uh,

354
00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:57.580
where this line goes is that they have access to political power,
uh,

355
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.820
that to even if they are,
even if they're in PR,
in Prussia,

356
00:22:00.821 --> 00:22:03.910
a place that's dominated by the nobles who are called the Younkers,

357
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.920
as most of you know,
uh,

358
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.460
they will still have access by virtue of their wealth to political power,

359
00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:10.930
which is exactly the way they want it.

360
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.120
And there's a revolution in France in 1830,

361
00:22:13.121 --> 00:22:17.130
yet another one that you can read about.
And arguably,
I mean,
more access.

362
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.890
And in a way it's sort of true.
What it does is it brings to Fran,
uh,

363
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.660
power and France,
the big boars was the,

364
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:27.280
and they have the ear of the King Louie Felipe who calls himself to a citizen

365
00:22:27.281 --> 00:22:31.420
King.
He would rule from 1830 to 1848.
And in the,
the,

366
00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:33.100
the portraits of him,

367
00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:38.700
the paintings that he had done to represent who he was very different than those

368
00:22:39.581 --> 00:22:43.540
of the Bourbon kings.
The Bourbon kings are all looking like,
you know,

369
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:47.530
even the kind of pathetic successors of Louis the 14th,
uh,

370
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.830
they're looking like big people in Chateaus,
uh,

371
00:22:50.831 --> 00:22:55.450
who are kings of all that they see,
which of course was more or less the case.

372
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:59.530
Louis Felipe's view of himself with it.
He was the citizen citizen King.

373
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:02.740
That's what he calls himself.
He's still the king.
He was knowable.

374
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.310
He was not any bourgeois,
but in the official paintings of him,

375
00:23:06.311 --> 00:23:11.170
you'll Hugh see people dressed like me who are coming into the throne room.

376
00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:16.890
They're dressed like me in dark suits and they have power and he wants them in

377
00:23:18.161 --> 00:23:21.850
the painting with him.
That's terribly revealing is terribly interesting.

378
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.940
So these are people,
these are big bankers,
high finance,
here's at the top.
Um,

379
00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.840
and then you've got,
you know,
you've got other layers of,
uh,

380
00:23:28.841 --> 00:23:31.660
of which was he and you,
and you could kind of fill in the gap here.

381
00:23:31.661 --> 00:23:35.840
We have smaller bankers not in size,
but you know,
in money,
uh,

382
00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.080
industrialists,
merchants,

383
00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:42.820
these kinds of people and don't obey the great character,
tourists,

384
00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:47.130
least favorite people,
lawyers,
lawyers,
uh,
be,
you know,

385
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:51.920
rise up rapidly in,
in,
in,
in popular esteem.
Uh,

386
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:56.600
in usefulness in the middle class.
Likes to see themselves as useful.
Uh,

387
00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:00.580
and so you,
you find lawyers reaching,
uh,
in there and,

388
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.220
and slowly doctors.
Cause remember,
doctors had very low social status.

389
00:24:04.221 --> 00:24:07.970
They were sort of a cut above a bad pun.
I making what you read,
uh,
you know,

390
00:24:07.971 --> 00:24:12.820
ordinary,
uh,
uh,
field surgeons,
uh,
during the Napoleonic battle,

391
00:24:12.821 --> 00:24:16.620
some of whom were butchers or people that knew how to wield a knife.
Uh,

392
00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:17.530
and you know,

393
00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:21.860
doctors increase the self identity and become more important in the 19th
century.

394
00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:26.050
You also find notaries no matter what country you're in.
Notaries.
Now notaries,

395
00:24:26.051 --> 00:24:29.960
hold all,
have a much bigger role in Europe than they do here.
Notaries,

396
00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:34.010
they know where all the goodies are.
When you buy property,
by the way in France,

397
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.380
uh,
you buy property,
you pay,
if you have a mortgage,

398
00:24:36.381 --> 00:24:39.200
you pay 12% of right off the top,

399
00:24:39.201 --> 00:24:43.100
goes to the notary just for holding in his office.
Your deed.

400
00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.030
If you don't have a mortgage,
a you pay 7% right off the top.

401
00:24:47.031 --> 00:24:51.560
So notaries know all of the secrets of people with money.

402
00:24:51.561 --> 00:24:55.820
So notaries are important in all of these countries,
um,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

403
00:24:55.821 --> 00:24:59.660
I mean,
you can kind of fill in the occupation,
but they share things together.

404
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:04.250
Then at the bottom you have the petty bourgeoisie and everybody's poking fun at

405
00:25:04.251 --> 00:25:07.250
the petty bourgeoisie,
but they too had a self identity.

406
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:11.180
My phone one day in the stacks of the library,
the University of Michigan,

407
00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.520
a pamphlet that was actually,
uh,
it was,
uh,

408
00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.350
a report on the w surely must have been the last,

409
00:25:18.351 --> 00:25:23.351
but any case was the first world congress of the petty bourgeoisie and where

410
00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:27.170
they met appropriately enough in Brussels.
Can you imagine going to a con,

411
00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:28.940
you know,
professional history conferences,

412
00:25:28.941 --> 00:25:31.160
they all have their little name tags and all they do,

413
00:25:31.161 --> 00:25:34.010
they start up your body and look at your name tags and see if it's worth looking

414
00:25:34.011 --> 00:25:36.830
at your face.
I mean,
it's really pathetic.
Uh,
and,

415
00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.410
and can you imagine going to a conference like the world,

416
00:25:39.411 --> 00:25:42.140
the congress of the petty bourgeoisie and you know,
a high,
you know,

417
00:25:42.141 --> 00:25:45.860
world congress of the petty,
but which was the,
hi,
my name,
my name is out of bear.

418
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.330
Uh,
but they had a self identity now who were in the petty bourgeoisie.
Well,

419
00:25:50.331 --> 00:25:54.680
lots of these classically new 19th century professions,

420
00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:59.030
school teachers,
school teachers were,
uh,
were,
uh,
uh,

421
00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:02.510
a way of social mobility for peasant families,
whether they were in Italy,

422
00:26:02.511 --> 00:26:05.120
whether they were in Germany,
whether they're an Australia,
whether or hungry,

423
00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.000
whether they're in Switzerland,
no matter where they were.

424
00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:12.390
And I'll out of the working class or out of the peasantry,
um,

425
00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:16.230
female school teachers become increasingly more important.
They always were the,

426
00:26:16.231 --> 00:26:18.110
in Catholic schools because there were nuns,
you know,

427
00:26:18.111 --> 00:26:22.430
with the big hats and all that.
Um,
and,
and very doing very good job,

428
00:26:22.431 --> 00:26:25.250
even though often they were undereducated and it was kind of hard for them to do

429
00:26:25.251 --> 00:26:25.670
that.

430
00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:30.670
But school teachers you'd find here and also a cafe owners or tavern owners,

431
00:26:31.041 --> 00:26:34.970
vine Staub owners in a,
I'm just giving you,
you know,
a couple of examples,

432
00:26:34.971 --> 00:26:39.140
but these are,
these are the petty bourgeoisie and also very importantly,

433
00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:43.460
what do you do with artisans and craftsmen?
Master artisans,

434
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:47.340
they own the tools that they're journeymen work with.

435
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:52.620
They rent or own their shops when things are doing,
going pretty well.

436
00:26:52.621 --> 00:26:56.010
They do pretty well themselves.
But when things aren't going well,

437
00:26:56.011 --> 00:26:59.640
they don't do well.
And that's why they're on the barricades.
All these times,

438
00:26:59.641 --> 00:27:01.560
as you know,
in the French Revolution,

439
00:27:01.561 --> 00:27:05.060
the French revolutions and in the revolutions of 1848 issue,

440
00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:09.150
she'll discover in Vienna and Berlin and other places,
they're always there.

441
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:13.950
So these folks are here too.
Um,
and uh,
so this,
this is your basic,

442
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.790
you know,
petty bourgeoisie and people are always a dumping all over them.

443
00:27:17.791 --> 00:27:21.770
But I will give,
uh,
uh,
needlessly,
but I will give you some example now in,

444
00:27:21.771 --> 00:27:24.950
in order to,
if you ever read that the Great French Sha,
oh,

445
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:25.860
he was paid by the word.

446
00:27:25.861 --> 00:27:29.070
As you can see when he has a description of a single sofas that go on for about

447
00:27:29.071 --> 00:27:32.940
two pages.
But BALZAC Balzac is really the,
you know,
the,

448
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:34.920
the novelist of the bourgeoisie

449
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.350
when he describes Paris and,

450
00:27:40.351 --> 00:27:44.940
and the 17 to 19% of the population who are increasingly living in the western

451
00:27:44.941 --> 00:27:46.020
part of Paris.
More about that.

452
00:27:46.021 --> 00:27:51.021
Another time he describes it as a jungle that you count your money in the

453
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:54.990
morning and then you count your money when you come home.
By the way,
your wife,

454
00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:59.760
uh,
who would,
in the census we listed as not working.
If you were a shopkeeper,

455
00:27:59.761 --> 00:28:02.190
your wife was the one who kept care of the accounts.

456
00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:05.580
Your wife was the one who is by behind the counter when you were working,

457
00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:09.360
when you're an artisan.
So he just describes us as a jungle.

458
00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:12.930
So in order to get to,
to really give it an image of what that was like.

459
00:28:12.931 --> 00:28:15.560
He's got it.
I got to find this thing someplace.
But,
uh,

460
00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:20.460
he's got this one magnificent print called the street of the four winds and

461
00:28:20.461 --> 00:28:23.850
that's a street in Paris though.
Who would they cut to?
A wall that's near,
um,

462
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.910
near old,
young.
It doesn't matter.
But here's a guy dressed like me.

463
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:28.200
See there's a theme in this.

464
00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.170
He's dressed like me and he's wearing his bourgeois had,

465
00:28:31.171 --> 00:28:34.680
I don't have one of those.
My only hat says it has an m for Michigan on it.
Uh,

466
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:39.480
and the hat,
his one suit isn't going to blow off his body,

467
00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:42.060
but the wind is taking his hat,

468
00:28:42.061 --> 00:28:47.061
which is a symbol of who he is and the wind is carrying it away from his hand

469
00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:51.650
and in,
in,
in several hundred brush stokes strokes,
Joe,
me,

470
00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:56.660
mea captures the look of panic on his face because he's going to go home without

471
00:28:56.761 --> 00:28:59.430
his hat.
And his wife's going to say,
where's your hat?
And said,
well,

472
00:28:59.431 --> 00:29:01.200
the wind blew it away and he's got to buy one.

473
00:29:01.201 --> 00:29:05.580
And they've got to put the money together so he is not going to fall off the

474
00:29:05.581 --> 00:29:10.350
ladder in this jungle.
So then you have to imagine this is a,
as a ladder,

475
00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:15.960
like this,
social mobility is the goal and you want to have enough,

476
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:20.080
uh,
enough money to leave to your 2.2 children.
Um,

477
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:21.540
so then to really make this go,

478
00:29:21.541 --> 00:29:25.830
you'd have to vines up here like the jungle and then,

479
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:30.600
and then you'd have to grease this pole through bad economic times.

480
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:35.410
Let's say in Europe,
18,
uh,
18,
16,
18,
17,
18,
20.

481
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.750
Don't write this down.
Please don't if you do your compulsive,
I'm compulsive.

482
00:29:38.751 --> 00:29:42.220
But 18,
26,
27,
uh,
80,
80,
40,

483
00:29:42.221 --> 00:29:45.700
41 really bad when 1846,
47,
1855.

484
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:49.390
Those are the really bad years.
And at that point,
if you don't get credit,

485
00:29:49.391 --> 00:29:50.021
that's what's going on.

486
00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:54.280
Now here she can't get credit because people withdraw the credit.
Same thing.

487
00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:59.470
Then here you go.
Look out below you slide down this Paul,

488
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.130
and what happens down below here?
Holy cow,

489
00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.140
that's the big C.

490
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.860
There's just a wretched movie called the Poseidon Adventure once,

491
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:10.760
but it had an image where the,
you know,

492
00:30:10.761 --> 00:30:15.250
the water's kind of coming up below and it's going to finally get to the top and

493
00:30:15.251 --> 00:30:16.330
there's no more room to breathe.

494
00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:20.470
And this is how the people on the bottom part of this ladder viewed the demands

495
00:30:20.471 --> 00:30:24.450
of the working class because they want to vote too.
And what if they voted,

496
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.970
vote in somebody who wants to raise your taxes or something like that.
Boy,

497
00:30:27.971 --> 00:30:31.780
Oh boy,
that's scary.
But what's down here?
This is ordinary people.

498
00:30:31.781 --> 00:30:36.100
This is the other 70.
What would it be in the case of Paris,
uh,

499
00:30:36.101 --> 00:30:41.101
83% of the population and you're going to fall into that ranks of the

500
00:30:41.351 --> 00:30:45.220
proletariat if you're on those bottom,
bottom,
uh,

501
00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:50.620
uh,
if you're,
if,
if you're on the,
on the bottom kind of rungs here,
uh,

502
00:30:50.621 --> 00:30:51.730
and so this has got to be,

503
00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:56.560
this is your jungle and you're trying to make it up there to the big time.

504
00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:01.750
And uh,
the chances are that in these bad years,
ah,

505
00:31:01.751 --> 00:31:06.190
you're going to a fall down.
But yet lots of people get up in the ranks of,
of,

506
00:31:06.191 --> 00:31:08.180
of the,
of the,
uh,

507
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:12.190
of the middle classes increases everywhere in the 19th century in Russia to

508
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:15.190
everywhere.
Uh,
that simply the case.
Now,

509
00:31:15.191 --> 00:31:18.940
if I could just bring down

510
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.730
this,
so what I'm doing,
yeah,
that's what I'm doing.

511
00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.550
Bring down that and show you how this works.

512
00:31:27.551 --> 00:31:32.410
Had talked about some accoutrements of middleclass culture that you will

513
00:31:32.411 --> 00:31:36.940
recognize.
Many of you now,
this is the guy at the top.
This is domain.

514
00:31:36.941 --> 00:31:39.880
A domain is the greatest card characters just in the 19th century,

515
00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:43.450
and arguably ever,
uh,
to make an extreme assertion,

516
00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:46.300
but it really is a pretty true.
Um,

517
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.570
and so this is what he captures,
uh,
uh,
the,

518
00:31:50.571 --> 00:31:55.010
the prevailing mood in much of Europe,
uh,
in that money,
uh,

519
00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:59.050
more than blood,
if you're going to exclude places like Hungary,

520
00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:04.570
Poland,
uh,
Spain,
um,
and,

521
00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:09.250
uh,
Prussia,
um,
money talks more than,

522
00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:13.450
uh,
than blood.
And so what does the man doing?
He's counting his money.

523
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:14.830
I remember I said that,
you know,

524
00:32:14.831 --> 00:32:17.140
you counted your money in the morning and then you came home at night and,

525
00:32:17.141 --> 00:32:20.990
and uh,
and,
and count your money again and see how you've done,
uh,

526
00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:25.420
Miss Dameon these people.
No,
this is great.
Cause remember I said the,
the,
the,

527
00:32:25.421 --> 00:32:28.590
you know,
the variations within the bourgeoisie.
You can see this,

528
00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.030
some of these images,
I mean this is really not very interesting art,

529
00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:34.900
but that's not the point.
Look what this shows.
Now,
here's your,

530
00:32:34.901 --> 00:32:38.290
the guy at the left here is a clerk that's a very 19th century,

531
00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:42.320
a profession as it is for every,
uh,
every subject.
I,
he's,
by the way,

532
00:32:42.321 --> 00:32:46.250
this is before the 1816,
because that's when the real fountain pens or invented,

533
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:49.520
he's got your basic quill pen there.
Now look at the coat.

534
00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:53.990
They both have coached like mine,
but there's huge difference in them.

535
00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.630
This guy,
if you have extraordinary eyes,

536
00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:00.320
you will be able to see and can read upside down that he is reading a newspaper

537
00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:05.460
on the price of colonial goods imports.
And he is a wholesale Merson.

538
00:33:05.461 --> 00:33:10.280
So he's one of these people that's at the very top of my a triangle there.
Um,

539
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:13.280
and look at,
this guy's got his coat too.
This is early in the century.

540
00:33:13.281 --> 00:33:14.380
You can tell,
uh,

541
00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:18.110
now this is either the son in law or there would be son in law and he's put his,

542
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:21.080
you know,
the abortion was,
he didn't kiss and a hug a lot.
Uh,

543
00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:25.850
but he's got his hand drape rather daintily on the old guys,

544
00:33:25.851 --> 00:33:30.710
the arm here.
He's not about to embrace him and give him a kiss,

545
00:33:30.711 --> 00:33:32.970
a big kiss on each cheek.
Uh,

546
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:36.860
and one day all of this stuff will be his,
uh,

547
00:33:36.861 --> 00:33:40.820
if he plays his cards right.
Uh,
and they still had arranged marriages.
I mean,

548
00:33:40.821 --> 00:33:43.180
love could count for something,
but,
but marriages were,

549
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:46.220
we're still essentially less so for the middle classes,

550
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:50.450
but then for ordinary people,
but economic relationships,
that's what they were.

551
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:54.200
There were economic relationships,
a wrangling over the,
uh,

552
00:33:54.201 --> 00:33:57.170
the dowry and that kind of thing.
Now what about,
look at our,
our,

553
00:33:57.171 --> 00:33:59.900
our guy on the left,
he's working very hard there.

554
00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:04.830
And this pole that is put up there has a real sense of,

555
00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.050
of dividing these.

556
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:10.640
So it's like the barriers on my quite arbitrary and not terribly well designed

557
00:34:10.641 --> 00:34:14.540
triangle there.
Uh,
do these people have something in common?
Yes,

558
00:34:14.541 --> 00:34:18.200
they will in 1830 and they will in 1848,

559
00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:22.580
but the rest of the time they don't.
He's dreaming about being this guy and it,

560
00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:27.310
but if you'll work very hard and,
and he's educated,
uh,
he will have had,
um,

561
00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:32.510
probably not secondary education.
Most people didn't,
didn't go to a high school,

562
00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:37.430
Secondary Lycee,
uh,
in France or,
or Gimnasio in Germany,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

563
00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:41.390
Uh,
but you know,
it,
it represents this world.
And this guy,
by the way,

564
00:34:41.391 --> 00:34:44.780
we also know that this guy,
uh,
his,
um,
this,

565
00:34:44.781 --> 00:34:47.150
this takes place right in the center of Paris,

566
00:34:47.151 --> 00:34:51.070
right behind the big department stores.
Subsequently,
uh,
the,
uh,
oh,

567
00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:54.320
tell Devita but right.
I the ashtray,
that was our low to the V,

568
00:34:54.321 --> 00:34:57.470
which is a big department store,
but right near the town hall.
So anyway,

569
00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:02.010
there we go.
Now,
this is another,
uh,
uh,
this has got to get my watch,

570
00:35:02.011 --> 00:35:06.710
so I can keep track of things here.
Uh,
this is another,
a Vr,
this is very common.

571
00:35:06.711 --> 00:35:09.250
You see this in the book you're reading and saying,
but,
um,

572
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:13.130
these things have their geographic,
uh,
uh,
or,

573
00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:18.020
or I mean they can be represented a spatially very easily.

574
00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:23.210
And one of the themes over the long run is that the emergence of city increased

575
00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:27.620
development of,
of prosperous,
western Paris,
prosperous,

576
00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:32.300
western London,
prosperous,
a center,
Vienna and other places,

577
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:36.050
and increasingly impoverished east,
east and the periphery.

578
00:35:36.051 --> 00:35:39.780
And that's another theme,
but steel through much of the period.
And it need to,

579
00:35:39.781 --> 00:35:43.740
to a lesser extent still today,
uh,
where you live in a building,

580
00:35:43.741 --> 00:35:45.750
depending on reflecting how much money you had.

581
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:49.740
Now the ground floor in French called them of,
she'll say,
you know,

582
00:35:49.741 --> 00:35:51.690
this is the concierge there.

583
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:56.160
And the concierge will be somebody very modest means,
uh,
you know,

584
00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:59.250
we would probably place them in the,
in the,
in the petty bourgeoisie there.

585
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.150
And then the big apartment,
uh,
on the main,
on the first floor,
you know,

586
00:36:03.151 --> 00:36:07.650
high ceilings,
big party.
I'll be,
lots of people dress like me.
They're a piano.

587
00:36:07.651 --> 00:36:09.840
More about pianos in a minute.
Uh,

588
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:13.230
so this is my triangle sort of upside down,
isn't it?

589
00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:17.610
And the more you go up there,
the,
you're still within the middle class.

590
00:36:17.611 --> 00:36:21.510
The guy above,
he's got these little Napoleonic beds there.

591
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:25.560
This guy got hope.
He started closing his ears against his own baby there.
But no,

592
00:36:25.561 --> 00:36:28.950
obviously,
because that's the,
uh,
this is a different house,
but he's a musician.

593
00:36:28.951 --> 00:36:29.820
This is all rather banal,

594
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:33.000
but nonetheless telling you got an artist up here with not much money,

595
00:36:33.001 --> 00:36:35.670
but he still has a little bit of furniture,
not much.
Uh,

596
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:37.920
his nosy neighbor looking at his painting.

597
00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:42.540
And then on the top you've got the poorest of the mall besides the cat who's on

598
00:36:42.541 --> 00:36:43.374
the roof up there.

599
00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:48.060
You've got a seamstress and anyone looking at this very popular lithograph would

600
00:36:48.061 --> 00:36:51.480
immediately see that she has some dignity left.
Why?

601
00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:56.940
Because she has not yet pawned her mattress.
And there's a lot,
his great novel,

602
00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.780
lost some wows.

603
00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:02.760
Your vest dies like a dog and a bed of Straw because there was no more mattress

604
00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:06.750
and she was be at the very top.
And now of course,
these,
these rooms,

605
00:37:06.751 --> 00:37:08.640
which then became in the 20th century student rooms,

606
00:37:08.641 --> 00:37:12.780
and then we're transformed into enormously expensive loss.
Uh,
but this steel,

607
00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:16.890
this is a way of visually visualizing the spatial concomitants of what I'm

608
00:37:16.891 --> 00:37:21.240
talking about.
And people were aware of what the symbols meant.
And He,
I mean,

609
00:37:21.241 --> 00:37:23.820
this was,
this is your classic,
uh,
uh,

610
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:27.600
Homburg finance here is apartment.
Uh,

611
00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.570
and we don't need to go on and on about the,
the,
the,
uh,

612
00:37:30.571 --> 00:37:34.800
the kind of material culture of wealth.
But,
but there it is.

613
00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:37.870
So let's go on and on about it.

614
00:37:37.871 --> 00:37:42.720
And another one that's easier to pick up for your eyes there.
Um,
this,

615
00:37:42.721 --> 00:37:46.020
here again,
we know we're on one of the lower floors.
Why?

616
00:37:46.021 --> 00:37:48.930
Because you see the trees outside the window.
Uh,

617
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:53.130
you've got a domesticated animal,
you know,
ordinary people,
you know,

618
00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.860
it didn't have as many domesticated dogs had a real purpose.
They,

619
00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.390
they bring the sheep down the mountain.

620
00:37:57.391 --> 00:38:00.540
My wife just came down the mountain two weeks ago,
bringing the sheep down,
uh,

621
00:38:00.541 --> 00:38:02.090
from friends of ours in the village.
And you know,

622
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:06.450
all of these dogs are useful things and keep the sheep in line and all of that.

623
00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:09.900
Um,
you've got,
uh,
I mean this is all obvious stuff,
but you've got slippers,

624
00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:13.120
ordinary people to not wear slippers.
You've got a domestic servant,

625
00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:15.920
a domestic servants cost almost nothing.
Uh,

626
00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:19.260
it was considered to be a way of moving up the ladder to say that you had for

627
00:38:19.261 --> 00:38:21.900
domestic servers instead of three,
instead of three,
uh,

628
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:25.950
you've got a brass or copper here or the heater.
That's a good sign.

629
00:38:25.951 --> 00:38:29.480
You've got very fancy chairs.
Look,
these,
these are very good chairs,

630
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:32.850
sort of Louie for leap chairs.
Uh,
you've got print culture,

631
00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.010
a big old porcelain plate on the above there,

632
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:39.040
and you've got that wordswag coach from at the piano.

633
00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:44.110
The Piano replaces the Harpsichord,
the piano.
Uh,
you know,
it,

634
00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.630
it just,
uh,

635
00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:50.640
Leon Planning Guy who's in j college who's a retired professor of music,

636
00:38:50.641 --> 00:38:52.480
has got great stuff on,
on this,

637
00:38:52.481 --> 00:38:55.450
the role of role of the piano and the emergence of,

638
00:38:55.451 --> 00:38:59.850
along with Bill Weber teaches it,
did teach it at,
uh,
where do you teach it at?

639
00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:03.760
At Long Beach.
Um,
the,
the emergence of the,
of,
of,
uh,

640
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:09.030
of the public concert as opposed to the Chateau concert or the church concert,

641
00:39:09.431 --> 00:39:12.910
the public concert.
And along with that comes the piano.
Now,

642
00:39:12.911 --> 00:39:16.090
pianos were expensive,
but the middle class has piano.
It's working.

643
00:39:16.091 --> 00:39:18.850
People don't have pianos.
Middleclass people have pianos.

644
00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:22.480
So you also see something else that's important here.
There's more than one room.

645
00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:25.180
And you'll see in a minute,
there's even more than two rooms.

646
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:26.740
There are lots of rooms.

647
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:30.160
And what the middleclass wants all those people in that triangle,

648
00:39:30.161 --> 00:39:34.780
they want privacy.
They want privacy.
They want their own rooms.

649
00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:38.950
Uh,
so she's playing the,
uh,
other piano.
Well,
I mean,

650
00:39:38.951 --> 00:39:42.580
it's all obvious stuff and there's the kitchen.
Now,
this is not the wife.

651
00:39:42.581 --> 00:39:46.870
These are the domestic.
This is the domestic with her children,
uh,

652
00:39:46.871 --> 00:39:51.730
who are part of the team has been hired to help run this,
uh,
run this household.

653
00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:52.191
There are,
you get,

654
00:39:52.191 --> 00:39:55.600
you see the trees were in the same apartment there and you have real,

655
00:39:55.601 --> 00:40:00.170
real copper pots,
uh,
back before the Bush dollar,
you know,
people would buy,

656
00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:04.510
bring back,
uh,
uh,
you know,
from,
from Paris and from Europe,

657
00:40:04.511 --> 00:40:08.350
these enormously heavy copper pots.
I've carried so many of them back.

658
00:40:08.351 --> 00:40:10.810
It's incredible.
Uh,
and that was a,
you know,

659
00:40:10.811 --> 00:40:15.600
ordinary people did not cook with things like that.
Uh,
so,
uh,
uh,
there,

660
00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:20.390
there we go.
I mean,
these are the kinds of symbols of,
of all of this.
Now,
um,

661
00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:21.430
the,

662
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:26.430
the middleclass wants privacy and they also develop something else.

663
00:40:27.101 --> 00:40:30.340
And this is how almost trite to say it because so many people have said it,
but,

664
00:40:30.341 --> 00:40:32.440
but,
uh,
and it can be exaggerated,

665
00:40:32.441 --> 00:40:37.030
but the middleclass arguably helps create the notion of childhood,

666
00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:41.680
uh,
that in many early morning painting,
early modern paintings,
children are,

667
00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:46.290
are our PR trade as her little squished up adults and that sort of thing.
And,

668
00:40:46.291 --> 00:40:50.410
and children come into their own in,
in the 19th century,
ordinary people,

669
00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:54.000
ordinary peasants,
you know,
children,
everybody's,
uh,

670
00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:57.990
they slept with the animals often along with the adults.
Uh,
uh,

671
00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:01.450
most ordinary people and some of the worst tenements in,
in Europe where it,

672
00:41:01.451 --> 00:41:06.380
we're in,
in Edinburgh,
uh,
and in Glasgow and in Lille,

673
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:10.690
in France,
but also in Berlin and lots of places.
There were no secrets.

674
00:41:10.691 --> 00:41:14.180
Everybody slept in the same room.
I,
there were no secrets at all.
And well,

675
00:41:14.181 --> 00:41:18.810
what the middleclass wants besides social mobility and access to a political,
uh,

676
00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:23.380
power is they want space.
And so the notion of childhood,
you know,

677
00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:27.130
childhood didn't exist for,
for ordinary people.
You started working,

678
00:41:27.131 --> 00:41:29.830
helping out sole,
you know,
when you were five or six years old,

679
00:41:29.831 --> 00:41:33.160
you started tending the,
the animals and the little courtyard is the,

680
00:41:33.161 --> 00:41:38.090
is they would call it taking care of chickens and rabbits and things like that.

681
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:39.440
You know,
I'm working people,

682
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:42.650
their children went to work right away as soon as they can make anything.

683
00:41:42.651 --> 00:41:44.660
And if they were,
if they're reporting and have jobs,

684
00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.040
something were sent out to beg,

685
00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:51.710
childhood became a middle class phenomenon.
It's should we,

686
00:41:51.711 --> 00:41:52.910
sure nobles had children,

687
00:41:52.911 --> 00:41:55.110
but it was a different way of bringing up your children.
Uh,

688
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:59.630
nobles did not send their children to,
uh,
uh,
to,
uh,
uh,
to,
to,

689
00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.030
to public schools or even a private schools.

690
00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:07.180
They were educated to some extent at least by a private tutors.

691
00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:12.530
And so,
um,
even the notion of,
of the children's hour,
uh,

692
00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:13.850
the children's room,
I mean,

693
00:42:13.851 --> 00:42:17.660
the idea of a children's room of having your own room or rooms shared with a

694
00:42:17.661 --> 00:42:20.600
sibling was something that was just inconceivable.
Uh,

695
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:23.450
for the majority of Europeans,
the vast,

696
00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:27.950
vast majority of Europeans,
the children's hour,
I can even remember,
you know,

697
00:42:27.951 --> 00:42:31.490
the horror show of being summoned for the children's hour when you're supposed

698
00:42:31.491 --> 00:42:31.851
to come out,

699
00:42:31.851 --> 00:42:35.600
when they were guests and run through your extraordinarily modest bag of tricks,

700
00:42:35.601 --> 00:42:38.630
you know,
for the guests.
And then your resets are packing and says,

701
00:42:38.631 --> 00:42:40.400
I couldn't play a note on a piano.

702
00:42:40.401 --> 00:42:44.600
Had been been expelled from piano after two weeks.
Bye Bye.
And sent back to the,

703
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:49.580
to the playing fields,
uh,
by a nun,
uh,
in Portland,
Oregon.

704
00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:53.480
I didn't have many,
many tricks to show,
but,
but the children's hour,
uh,

705
00:42:53.481 --> 00:42:57.710
all of this stuff comes out of the middle class.
How about birth control?

706
00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:01.670
For example,
how about birth control?
How about not having 10 or 11 children?

707
00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:06.020
We have friends,
one of whom unfortunately just died.
Very older friends,
you know,

708
00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:11.000
who are born in the 1930s,
early thirties in,
um,
uh,
in the south of France.

709
00:43:11.001 --> 00:43:14.450
And one had 13 brothers and sisters and the other 11.
And they grew up in misery,

710
00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:19.220
absolute misery,
very,
very Catholic family in the center of France.

711
00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:20.600
Now the middleclass,

712
00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:24.740
particularly the French middleclass day start reducing their children,

713
00:43:24.741 --> 00:43:28.030
number of children in France in particular case because the,
the,

714
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:32.830
they get rid of that.
You could get around it by,
but primogeniture so the,
uh,

715
00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:37.820
the plot of land has to be divided up into two or three or four or five or 12 or

716
00:43:37.821 --> 00:43:40.730
what if you own no land,
not so good.
Uh,

717
00:43:40.731 --> 00:43:44.210
so they begin having an o 2.2 children or something like that.
Uh,

718
00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:47.360
so birth control,
you know,
in some,
some parts of Europe,

719
00:43:47.361 --> 00:43:49.880
people think that birth control really started with peasants and then moves up

720
00:43:49.881 --> 00:43:52.950
the moves up to the upper classes.
But basically,
uh,

721
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:55.490
particularly the case of France where it's been like most things studied,

722
00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.350
studied to death,
uh,

723
00:43:57.410 --> 00:44:00.800
birth control really begins with the middle classes and they are limiting their

724
00:44:00.801 --> 00:44:04.550
children so that their children can be,
uh,
you know,

725
00:44:04.551 --> 00:44:08.750
fee son of and inherit,
inherit the business.

726
00:44:08.751 --> 00:44:13.160
And hopefully I'd be left with enough money to make it go a print culture.

727
00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:15.710
I mean that was just an example of,
you know,
the whole salon,

728
00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.890
a salon that as a salon,
the idea of going to see art shows,

729
00:44:18.891 --> 00:44:21.170
it really starts in the 18th century.
But you know,

730
00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:25.410
the middle class wants to be seen rather like the Dutch,
uh,
um,

731
00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:28.250
detrimental class in,
in that we talked about in the 17th century,

732
00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:30.890
who wants to be seen having paintings and they wait in line to go to,

733
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:36.270
this is all a dome.
Yay.
Ah,
and this is the,
uh,
the,
the,
you know,

734
00:44:36.271 --> 00:44:39.720
the mall.
So the,
the,
the,
the piece that you have to,
uh,
you're,

735
00:44:39.721 --> 00:44:42.330
you're obliged to swallow,
uh,
after dinner.

736
00:44:42.331 --> 00:44:46.920
And here's the little girl being trotted out to play a few notes for the,
uh,

737
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:51.870
quite board,
uh,
uh,
people who are,
who are sitting there,
um,
and,

738
00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:56.460
uh,
waiting.
And even the idea of,
you know,
it,
this is,
it's your birthday papa.

739
00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.650
It's,
it's your birthday.
You know,

740
00:44:58.651 --> 00:45:01.920
you didn't take time out to celebrate a birthday if you were ordinary person and

741
00:45:01.921 --> 00:45:04.870
having to get to the fields at four in the morning,
in the summer,
uh,

742
00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:09.390
or going to work,
uh,
during the day.
Uh,
the culture of,

743
00:45:09.391 --> 00:45:13.620
of childhood,
uh,
is a really all of their,

744
00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:17.430
and also,
uh,
there's a whole notion of,
of,
of,
and,
and here again,

745
00:45:17.431 --> 00:45:20.840
this would probably fit rather awkwardly into the birth control,
uh,
uh,

746
00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:24.780
birth control description.
But there's this whole sense of,
of,
of being prepared,

747
00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:28.560
uh,
that emergence for the middle class.
And one of those sort of accoutrements.

748
00:45:28.561 --> 00:45:31.270
I went,
when I gave a equivalent of this lecture,
I had a,

749
00:45:31.271 --> 00:45:35.130
an old battered umbrella and I was trying to explain how people on the top rung,

750
00:45:35.131 --> 00:45:38.880
we're trying to beat down people at the bottom and smashing the,
you know,

751
00:45:38.881 --> 00:45:41.760
smashing this a umbrella,
sort of like,
you know,
uh,

752
00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:45.330
imaginary of somebody smashing the guitar on stage.
Uh,

753
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:50.040
but the point is that that umbrellas come with the middleclass and they are

754
00:45:50.041 --> 00:45:51.030
black umbrellas.

755
00:45:51.031 --> 00:45:54.360
They are not these big colored things you have now the idea of protecting that

756
00:45:54.361 --> 00:45:56.880
one suit.
I'm from Oregon.
We didn't carry umbrellas,

757
00:45:56.881 --> 00:45:59.970
get it rained all the time anyway,
and I just lose it.
Uh,
you would.

758
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.340
But the umbrella is our PR,

759
00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:05.340
our middleclass accoutrement along with the piano and along with the children's

760
00:46:05.341 --> 00:46:10.341
room and along with the children's hour and along with the idea of not having

761
00:46:10.381 --> 00:46:11.970
too many children,
uh,

762
00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:16.460
and along with the top hat and with the idea of,
of,
uh,

763
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:20.760
of wanting access to information through the newspapers,
uh,

764
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:22.050
wanting the right to vote,

765
00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:25.890
not probably not wanting those people down below one boy in the latter to vote,

766
00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:27.840
but demanding that you have the right to vote.

767
00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:31.830
They all share these things in common.
And lastly,

768
00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:36.690
gazing at his watch.
Lastly in the last one,
minute,
35 seconds,
that that remains,

769
00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:38.960
uh,
to me,
um,
the bourgeoisie,

770
00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:43.500
the middle classes and this particularly true of Germany and France,
uh,

771
00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:48.450
when of England to and have other places,
they want the right to bear arms.

772
00:46:48.451 --> 00:46:52.440
They want to be in the national guard and the National Guard might

773
00:46:52.441 --> 00:46:57.100
hypothetically be there in case there is,
there is an invasion of,
uh,
uh,

774
00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:01.540
of France or,
or,
or,
or Germany by,
uh,
I dunno,

775
00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:05.850
I mean some,
some distant place,
the fins or something.
Most unlikely,

776
00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:09.060
but the main reason that they wanted to join the national guard,

777
00:47:09.061 --> 00:47:11.910
and you had to own property to be in the national guard,

778
00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:16.620
you had to be defined as a property owning citizen to have the right to vote in

779
00:47:16.621 --> 00:47:17.700
all of these countries.

780
00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:22.710
The right to vote was defined until you have universal male suffrage by how much

781
00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.800
taxes you paid,
how much property you own.

782
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:30.940
So you can measure where you are on this ladder by much taxes you paid.

783
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.200
They don't want to pay a lot of taxes.
But property,
uh,

784
00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:37.930
reflects one's belief in one's own social worth.

785
00:47:37.931 --> 00:47:41.440
And that's the way they looked at it.
No longer was that the worth of,
of,
uh,

786
00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:44.950
of blood now.
So they formed these national guards,

787
00:47:44.951 --> 00:47:49.750
particularly after revolutions and after 1848 or after 1830 and for while they

788
00:47:49.751 --> 00:47:50.950
go march around.

789
00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:55.980
But these are mainly there to protect them against the workers should one day,

790
00:47:56.501 --> 00:48:00.190
all of these people try to rise up to come up,
climb up this ladder will,

791
00:48:00.191 --> 00:48:04.340
you'll be down there to stomp on their fingers or to shoot them down.
Uh,

792
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:07.330
and so it doesn't last very long.
And then they pretty soon they,

793
00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:09.690
this guy is tired.
He's,
hey,
this isn't Domii.
I don't know who it is.

794
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:13.150
Doesn't matter.
It's not very good.
But he's had it.
Uh,
he's freezing.

795
00:48:13.151 --> 00:48:14.530
His wife is kind of looking at him like,

796
00:48:14.531 --> 00:48:17.230
I don't know why you doing this stuff marching around in the middle of the
night.

797
00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:19.510
Uh,
no one's going to rise up anyway.

798
00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:23.500
This'll last is old blunder bus there on the left will be put back in the closet

799
00:48:23.501 --> 00:48:27.200
or taken out too to slay deer or some damn thing.
Uh,

800
00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:30.910
but that'll be the end of it.
And they'll turn it over to more,
uh,
professional,

801
00:48:30.911 --> 00:48:34.600
uh,
uh,
uh,
professional,
uh,
uh,

802
00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:38.920
repressive forces such as armies,
Domiguez and light lines.

803
00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.860
And this is the last one disappear in this painting,

804
00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:47.500
which is called the [inaudible].
Tom Known.
Yeah.
Don't write it down in Paris.

805
00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:49.690
Uh,
it's a street that no longer exist.

806
00:48:49.691 --> 00:48:53.560
It disappeared when [inaudible] built the boulevards and the 1850s and sixties,

807
00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:58.240
it was selected to disappear because it recalled an event in the early 1830s

808
00:48:58.450 --> 00:49:03.450
when these bourgeois panicked and start going into a house full of very ordinary

809
00:49:03.791 --> 00:49:05.410
people and simply shooting them all,

810
00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:10.610
simply shooting them and the light lines disappear with dome.

811
00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:15.070
He did another one of these after massacre in 1848 in a wall and it's been lost.

812
00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:17.560
We don't have it.
Route Trans known.
Yeah.

813
00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:22.450
Hd Domi in a,
at the bottom left,

814
00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:27.100
and the middle classes for all of their insistence that they have access to

815
00:49:27.101 --> 00:49:30.070
information,
at least in the case of France,

816
00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:35.370
they cheered on a press law in 1835 that kept Domii from tut touching political

817
00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:40.300
scenes such as this which were deemed too sensitive.

818
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:44.830
And the root Transylvania where this happened in the center of Paris simply

819
00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.810
disappeared,
uh,

820
00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:49.990
didn't quite disappear from the collective memory of people thinking about a

821
00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:52.450
presion things.
So in conclusion,

822
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.310
the more the middle class is extremely varied,
they share much.

823
00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:01.750
They have a common material culture.
Uh,
they,
they,
uh,

824
00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:06.370
share a belief in achieved status as measured by the amount of property that you

825
00:50:06.371 --> 00:50:09.880
had.
Uh,
they want devote,
they want a collective,

826
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:15.040
a collective voice in,
in decisions.
And for all of the,
the,

827
00:50:15.041 --> 00:50:18.870
the variety for a,
within the middle classes,
uh,
so,

828
00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:22.670
so beautifully described are depicted by [inaudible] and other people.
Uh,

829
00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:23.231
