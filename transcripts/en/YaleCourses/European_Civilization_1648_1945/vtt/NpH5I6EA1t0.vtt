1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.440
What I'd like to do today is to talk to you about what it is that distinguishes

2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.800
a European ideas about the shared history of the last century,

3
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.820
uh,

4
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.480
and uh,

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.320
the United States.

6
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:21.450
What makes Europe European,

7
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.090
uh,

8
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.000
and what makes its sense of history different from,

9
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.923
from ours.

10
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.790
And I think the primary difference,

11
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.830
um,

12
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.830
between Europe and the United States will be seen in about six days on the 11th

13
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.330
of November when honest,

14
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:42.390
the stay is commemorated all over Europe.

15
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.201
In fact,

16
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:48.201
it's now commemorated in eastern Europe as well as in western Europe since it

17
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:52.410
took the fall of the Soviet Union to remind people that 2 million Russian

18
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:54.270
soldiers died in the first world war.

19
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.080
And that the eastern front was the place where,

20
00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.680
uh,

21
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.060
the German army won the war and where the Russian revolution came directly out

22
00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:03.780
of it.

23
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.081
Uh,

24
00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:07.950
so the first world war is what made Europe in the 20th century European,

25
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.611
uh,

26
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:10.590
and it created the war,

27
00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:15.591
created a series of wounds that to a degree have never healed to a degree.

28
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.620
Uh,

29
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.620
and the primary reason for that is the bloodshed as the staggering casualties of

30
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:27.930
a degree and magnitude that no one had ever seen before.

31
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.580
When we talk about,

32
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.790
uh,

33
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.180
losses on the scale of the first world war,

34
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:35.400
we enter a surreal terrain.

35
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.670
I have great difficulty getting my mind around a figures of 1 million casualties

36
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:46.080
for the battle of [inaudible] 1916 or just about the same number for the battle

37
00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:46.914
of the Somme.

38
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.740
Battle of Ed don between February,

39
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.690
1916 and November was the longest battle in history.

40
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.370
It was 10 months without a break.

41
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.820
Uh,

42
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.680
there was nothing like it in the Second World War.

43
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.360
It pushed soldiers,

44
00:01:57.361 --> 00:01:59.730
human beings beyond the limits of human endurance.

45
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.220
And the primary,

46
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.240
uh,

47
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.240
way in which this wound has been remembered as is in terms of an array of

48
00:02:10.051 --> 00:02:11.310
commemorative practices,

49
00:02:11.311 --> 00:02:14.070
which describe what European identity is.

50
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.300
Uh,

51
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.830
not only was but his,

52
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.970
and I want to suggest that there are many reasons why the remembrance of the

53
00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:24.570
first world war has carried on throughout the 20th century in a defining way.

54
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.560
Um,

55
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.393
the first is,

56
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.510
is technology.

57
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.920
It's an accident that the first world war happened at the very moment that the

58
00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:39.270
film industry became the centerpiece of mass entertainment and has,

59
00:02:39.271 --> 00:02:41.850
this was the very first film make war,

60
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.240
and it was film make in a fictional way.

61
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.360
That is to say the technology of the day provided motion picture cameras for all

62
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:52.110
major armies.

63
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.020
And indeed they were used in all kinds of ways.

64
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.110
The problem was they never filmed battle.

65
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.340
We're almost never filmed battle.

66
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:01.390
They one or two exceptions.

67
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:06.391
But the important point is that generals and their staffs didn't want cameras on

68
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:07.960
the battlefield,

69
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.860
partly because it might produce evidence that would be useful to the other side.

70
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.460
And the other part of it is that the film might get back home and the family's

71
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:21.340
got to see it.

72
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.480
Then what would happen?

73
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.400
There's a famous story of the fictional film representation of war,

74
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:32.290
which is one reason why I think it is so iconic as a descriptive

75
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.730
element in European consciousness about the past,

76
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.330
uh,

77
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.000
in 1916 in the middle of the battle of the Somme,

78
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.700
which was a six months quagmire,

79
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:45.430
started by the British army on the 1st of July,

80
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.770
1916 and ended up roughly November,

81
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.150
1916 two for no gain whatsoever,

82
00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:52.450
and a million casualties in the middle of it,

83
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.770
a part of the British,

84
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.040
uh,

85
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.910
propaganda,

86
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.113
um,

87
00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.720
office.

88
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.220
It wasn't a ministry until 1918 was all done more or less informally until then,

89
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.850
uh,

90
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.330
decided to make a film to buck up public morale.

91
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.260
And so what they did was they filmed the battle of the Somme while it was being

92
00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:12.070
fought,

93
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.540
but they didn't fill in the fighting.

94
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.560
They filmed mock episodes were soldiers in training,

95
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:18.010
uh,

96
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.140
would go over the top in,

97
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.280
um,

98
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.770
a totally fictional representation of war.

99
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.100
The problem was that the people who saw this didn't know that it was found a.

100
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.070
And so when the film was shown in,

101
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:35.110
not in the middle of 1916 and August,

102
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:36.070
September,

103
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.750
1916 in the battle started on the 1st of July,

104
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.910
it was Shawn all over Britain,

105
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.480
20 million people saw it.

106
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.420
That is half of the population of the country.

107
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.540
There has never been a film that was seen by half of the population of any

108
00:04:51.971 --> 00:04:56.971
country in the world before that date or since it broke all box office records.

109
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.090
And what it showed in silence was the preparation for the battle,

110
00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:02.980
the huge artillery barrage,

111
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.570
and then men going over the top.

112
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:06.010
And because it was phony,

113
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.750
there were men who went over the top,

114
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.800
stop for a moment,

115
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:10.060
and then slid right down again,

116
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.160
which caused women in the theaters that saw that to faint because they did know

117
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.560
that this was simply nonsense,

118
00:05:17.561 --> 00:05:18.490
that it was fiction.

119
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.120
And I think that the critical point to bear in mind therefore,

120
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.640
is that as a filmic war,

121
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.720
the war turned into myth at the very moment that it was being fought.

122
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.350
Nobody had ever seen the landscape of the dark side of the moon that was created

123
00:05:34.571 --> 00:05:39.571
by industrialized war between 1914 to 1918 and the way it was represented by

124
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:45.250
film was completely fictional because film comes straight out of theater.

125
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.030
It has a proceed IOM arch and has a vanishing point than anyone who's ever been

126
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:50.020
anywhere near a battle.

127
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.900
We'll realize that battles don't have vanishing points.

128
00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:53.920
People vanish in them,

129
00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:55.840
but they go in every conceivable direction.

130
00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.410
The of war became a matter of myth right in the middle of the war itself and it

131
00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:05.720
became a battle of myth to be remembered.

132
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.730
I'll give you another example which makes the point really powerful,

133
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.571
very,

134
00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:12.440
very powerful.

135
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.170
In February,

136
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.530
1916 the German army decided to push through German French lines at Van don.

137
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.880
This big 10 months battle,

138
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:23.940
which is the biggest of all time took place and in the course of it,

139
00:06:23.941 --> 00:06:27.650
a series of completely made up stories turned into legend.

140
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.810
One is called the trench of the bayonets,

141
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.990
and what it shows is there were no trenches in the battle of it.

142
00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:35.870
Then the word isolated pockets of men and big underground forts.

143
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.560
And there was simply artillery barrage going on day and night for 10 months.

144
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.130
So little pockets of men would be caught in one part of the battle and they

145
00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:46.190
stayed put to make sure that the Germans would not get through.

146
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.730
The French line was in a passer on par.

147
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.750
They won't get through and they didn't.

148
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.880
One group of such men were almost certainly buried by a landslide because the

149
00:06:55.881 --> 00:07:00.440
weight of artillery barrage in the mud would mean that earth would move when

150
00:07:00.441 --> 00:07:01.251
indeed the,

151
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:01.431
uh,

152
00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:05.030
the artillery barrage hit a particularly wet part of the,

153
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.893
of the front.

154
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.390
So a group of men were buried alive,

155
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.080
which is a very normal practice in the course of the first world war,

156
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.780
the German group of soldiers,

157
00:07:14.781 --> 00:07:19.781
the platoon that took it put bayonets basically sticking up out of the ground to

158
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:23.840
indicate to the French where to find the dead so that they could be buried

159
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:24.530
during,

160
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.191
uh,

161
00:07:25.191 --> 00:07:26.210
allowing the fighting.

162
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.300
The French didn't interpret it that way.

163
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.170
What they said was,

164
00:07:30.171 --> 00:07:33.760
here are 15 French men who stood with their band.

165
00:07:33.761 --> 00:07:38.030
That's there until they were buried alive and they didn't move an inch in the

166
00:07:38.031 --> 00:07:38.970
past on par.

167
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:39.561
Now,

168
00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:42.050
this is a completely made up story,

169
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.440
but it became a sacred site commemorated every 2020 2nd of February,

170
00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:50.830
1917 1819 in,

171
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:51.441
in other words,

172
00:07:51.441 --> 00:07:55.970
the war itself created a mythic set of representations of war that have come out

173
00:07:55.971 --> 00:07:56.804
to the present.

174
00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.440
The Great War created myth in other ways.

175
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.500
Another one came from the landing and globally now glibly was a Turkish

176
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.290
peninsula south of Istanbul,

177
00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:10.130
Constantinople.

178
00:08:10.131 --> 00:08:14.300
Then it's about a four hour taxi drive and lousy traffic probably took longer

179
00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:14.990
than,

180
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.290
but the idea of the allies was to knock Turkey out of the war,

181
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:23.291
help Russia and possibly in circle Germany by not attacking directly through the

182
00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:24.561
western front,

183
00:08:24.561 --> 00:08:26.720
but coming around through Asia Minor.

184
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:31.160
This landing was a catastrophic failure.

185
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:36.640
It was the brainchild of Winston Churchill who until 1940 when Hitler made him

186
00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:38.120
the great man that we all remember,

187
00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:43.040
it was a complete failure politically in a military affairs glibly was his idea,

188
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:43.910
and he's,

189
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:44.390
he's,

190
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:48.770
he shared in the form of what is now called orientalism.

191
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:54.010
A complete underestimation of the capacity of a Muslim populations,

192
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.191
populations,

193
00:08:56.191 --> 00:08:58.230
Brown people to fight against Europeans.

194
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.220
So nobody had a look at the ground where the allies were supposed to land at

195
00:09:02.221 --> 00:09:03.054
glibly.

196
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:07.890
They didn't actually take account of the fact that the were very big cliffs to

197
00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:09.690
climb and when they got there,

198
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:12.600
they just reproduce trench warfare that had already existed.

199
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.010
It was a complete failure.

200
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.400
The landing though took place on the 24th 25th the night of the 24th fifth 25th

201
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:22.170
of April,

202
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.810
1915 and the people used for it.

203
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:28.740
We're Australian and New Zealand troops alongside British and French ones.

204
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:34.400
That landing was the birth of the Australian nation and to this day,

205
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.120
Anzac Day,

206
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:36.631
Australia,

207
00:09:36.631 --> 00:09:37.141
New Zealand,

208
00:09:37.141 --> 00:09:38.160
expeditionary core,

209
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.210
Anzac Day,

210
00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:40.920
our is sacred.

211
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:42.210
It's the,

212
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.280
it's the 4th of July and Australia.

213
00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:46.950
It's the moment of celebration through the shedding of blood,

214
00:09:46.951 --> 00:09:48.810
the winning of national pride.

215
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.920
Now this is the point I'm trying to make initially is that remembering the first

216
00:09:52.921 --> 00:09:57.921
World War is remembering sacred themes that define nations and the oddity of the

217
00:09:58.621 --> 00:10:00.720
first world war is that these nations were defined.

218
00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:04.320
First of all because they're a part of imperial powers.

219
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.800
But this war was at the one one in the same time,

220
00:10:07.801 --> 00:10:10.170
the apogee and the beginning of the end of empire.

221
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:15.430
And hence nations that affirmed their loyalty to Britain by dying on the beaches

222
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.431
of Galit.

223
00:10:15.431 --> 00:10:15.831
Billy,

224
00:10:15.831 --> 00:10:18.750
you're in the hills of glibly earned the right to break,

225
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.190
break away from Britain.

226
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:25.530
And this sacred moment is how the Great War turned into myth.

227
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:28.500
If you think this is light,

228
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:30.660
you're mistaken.

229
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.350
This is big time politics to this day.

230
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.290
Yesterday in the Sydney Morning Morning Herald,

231
00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:42.010
two Australian politicians virtually came to blows about how to remember

232
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:47.030
deliberately because it is at the core of the notion or the idea of what the

233
00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:48.420
nation has to be.

234
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.590
So the first point I want to make as remembering the first World War is

235
00:10:52.591 --> 00:10:56.610
remembering a series of myths and are iconic in the sense that they describe not

236
00:10:56.611 --> 00:10:58.890
just what happened at a particular moment,

237
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:04.160
but the describe what the rest of the 20th century might become and did become.

238
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.610
And that is the second point I think I'd like to draw to your attention.

239
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:14.030
What makes remembering the first world war so important is that it became the

240
00:11:14.071 --> 00:11:18.120
way in which war was configured throughout the 20th century in Europe.

241
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.740
In many respects,

242
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:23.400
this is a defining difference between the United States and Europe.

243
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.110
The Second World War in this,

244
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.020
in this country is quite different from the first.

245
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:33.170
The United States didn't really suffer the injuries of any major European

246
00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:35.131
country.

247
00:11:35.131 --> 00:11:36.090
In the first World War,

248
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.990
100,000 American soldiers died in the first world war,

249
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.360
perhaps 40,000 of them.

250
00:11:42.361 --> 00:11:43.320
There's a dispute on this,

251
00:11:43.321 --> 00:11:45.840
but perhaps 40,000 of them died from the Spanish flu,

252
00:11:45.841 --> 00:11:48.720
the worst influence epidemic in history that had everybody.

253
00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:49.860
It's civilians,

254
00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:50.970
it's soldiers,

255
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:56.150
but it particularly prayed as per many mutant viruses do on young adults.

256
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.670
So it got soldiers,

257
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.331
well,

258
00:11:58.331 --> 00:12:03.331
100,000 dead was roughly just roughly what the British army suffered in three

259
00:12:04.061 --> 00:12:05.440
weeks on the battle of the Somme.

260
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:06.370
In one battle,

261
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:12.010
the scale of casualties in the first world war is what makes it everybody's

262
00:12:12.011 --> 00:12:12.461
business.

263
00:12:12.461 --> 00:12:16.030
And the second reason why remembering the first world war is iconic is that it

264
00:12:16.031 --> 00:12:17.350
is universal in Europe.

265
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.940
It's family history.

266
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.570
Let me give you an example of what that means.

267
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:28.410
If you ever visit the extraordinary power of individual,

268
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.050
uh,

269
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:33.130
graveyards at the scene of the landings in Normandy,

270
00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:38.340
you will find that there are graves of 3000 American soldiers who died in the

271
00:12:38.861 --> 00:12:42.220
course of the first day of the landing on the 6th of June,

272
00:12:42.221 --> 00:12:45.460
1944 now that landing on the 6th of June,

273
00:12:45.461 --> 00:12:47.350
1944 was terrible.

274
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.840
It was an extraordinary day.

275
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.050
It was a day that should be remembered and is remembered.

276
00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:58.390
If any of you see the Steven Spielberg play saving a film,

277
00:12:58.450 --> 00:12:59.410
Saving Private Ryan,

278
00:12:59.411 --> 00:12:59.890
you'll see it.

279
00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:00.790
It is iconic.

280
00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:04.540
It should be the first day of the battle of the Somme.

281
00:13:04.541 --> 00:13:05.410
On the 1st of July,

282
00:13:05.411 --> 00:13:09.640
1916 was 20,000 British men killed.

283
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.910
The first day of the landing at Normandy.

284
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:17.940
3000 Americans killed that and landing at Normandy compared to the battle of the

285
00:13:18.371 --> 00:13:23.371
Somme shows us that the iconic battle for Britain of the first row was six times

286
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.160
as murderous in one day as the landings in Normandy.

287
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:32.370
And that sheer scale of casualties means that remembering the great war remains

288
00:13:33.791 --> 00:13:38.791
remembering loss of life that became universal throughout families throughout

289
00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:39.813
Europe.

290
00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:40.301
Now this,

291
00:13:40.301 --> 00:13:42.160
this is extraordinary in many respects,

292
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.930
until 1914,

293
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:46.330
war was not democratic.

294
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.800
Military service was not democratic either.

295
00:13:50.801 --> 00:13:54.220
It was aristocratic and rural in terms of the officer corps.

296
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.020
That's why the cavalry mattered so much.

297
00:13:56.021 --> 00:14:01.021
They came from the land or it was more or less the men whom general,

298
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:02.853
um,

299
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.560
and the general who defeated Napoleon Wellington put it,

300
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.000
who were the scum of the earth,

301
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.300
either the unemployable,

302
00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:16.050
overpopulation of major cities or indeed the over the unemployable populations

303
00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:17.380
of,

304
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:17.681
uh,

305
00:14:17.681 --> 00:14:19.720
of rural life in Europe as well.

306
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:20.620
Now,

307
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.350
what happens in 1914 is conscription,

308
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:28.470
universal conscription and to dating the war presented armies of a size that had

309
00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:33.901
never before been a been pulled together and these armies suffered casualties of

310
00:14:36.491 --> 00:14:39.580
roughly one out of eight killed.

311
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.130
And one out of three wounded.

312
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:47.590
We're talking about 70 million men in uniform in the first world war.

313
00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:53.190
9 million men killed roughly 25 million man wounded one out of every two men who

314
00:14:55.941 --> 00:14:56.900
served in the first world.

315
00:14:56.901 --> 00:14:57.770
What was a casualty?

316
00:14:57.771 --> 00:15:00.170
There were 8 million prisoners of war.

317
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.630
And in those camps,

318
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:06.140
illness was likely to kill you more than anything else.

319
00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.880
And critical thing to bear in mind therefore is that the first world war created

320
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:15.910
an astonishing and unprecedented the challenge of commemoration.

321
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:19.550
And the first challenge was the missing.

322
00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.900
And I want to take you through the commemorative forms that the first world war

323
00:15:23.901 --> 00:15:24.734
created,

324
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:28.670
which created cultural practices that are still very important today.

325
00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.400
Anybody going to England today,

326
00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:34.730
and I mean today was their last weekend in Oxford.

327
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:39.530
We'll see everybody wearing a little red poppy in your lapel.

328
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.890
And this is what you buy for a couple of pennies,

329
00:15:42.891 --> 00:15:46.910
whatever you want to give as a contribution to a charity called the Royal

330
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:46.911
British Legion,

331
00:15:46.911 --> 00:15:48.200
the biggest charity in Britain.

332
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:49.940
And it's still to this day,

333
00:15:49.941 --> 00:15:54.230
the biggest charity for those families and indeed survivors,

334
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:55.070
um,

335
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.850
and successive generations of those who serve their country and who were wounded

336
00:15:58.851 --> 00:15:59.684
or died in it.

337
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:00.380
Now,

338
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:04.790
the critical thing to bear in mind about this is that the mythic representation

339
00:16:04.791 --> 00:16:05.181
of war,

340
00:16:05.181 --> 00:16:06.470
which came out of film

341
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.560
has been matched by what I would call a family representation of war.

342
00:16:12.561 --> 00:16:15.110
That comes through cultural practices of remembrance.

343
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:20.510
We should never ever get away from the fact that remembering is a business that

344
00:16:20.511 --> 00:16:21.770
people make money out of it.

345
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:24.800
That's why films sell so well.

346
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.940
The history channel is dominated by stories about war.

347
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.360
It's an important thing to bear in mind that people make money out of

348
00:16:32.361 --> 00:16:33.290
representing war.

349
00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.450
It's an important thing to keep in mind,

350
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:39.960
but that's too cynical to suffice for a discussion of how uh,

351
00:16:39.961 --> 00:16:41.390
the first world war was remembered.

352
00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.810
It was remembered and still is remembered within families.

353
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.400
And the answer why is that?

354
00:16:46.401 --> 00:16:49.250
It's because of the universalization of bereavement.

355
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:50.121
Now,

356
00:16:50.121 --> 00:16:50.871
what's the problem?

357
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:52.490
The PR problems are threefold.

358
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.110
The first is the missing.

359
00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:59.570
The second is in some sense the irrelevance of conventional religious practices.

360
00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:04.190
And the third is the search for some kind of collective statement of why these

361
00:17:04.191 --> 00:17:04.671
men died.

362
00:17:04.671 --> 00:17:05.504
For what,

363
00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.220
what price victory.

364
00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:13.040
The missing half of those men who died in the first world war and we're talking

365
00:17:13.041 --> 00:17:15.650
about 9 million men have known on graves,

366
00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.340
not a trace of them exists.

367
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:20.691
This,

368
00:17:20.691 --> 00:17:21.524
by the way,

369
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:26.530
is exactly the same proportion of those who were killed at Ground Zero on nine

370
00:17:26.841 --> 00:17:29.990
11 half of them have vanished completely.

371
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:35.450
There are traces that matter the great deal to the families of the survivors,

372
00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:40.760
the survivors who need something to remember to mourn.

373
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:46.420
The fact that roughly 4 million men died without a trace made commemorating more

374
00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:47.961
very,

375
00:17:47.961 --> 00:17:52.260
very difficult because conventional religious practices require a site,

376
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:52.921
a grave,

377
00:17:52.921 --> 00:17:57.921
a place to go to where individuals can honor those who die and

378
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.220
take their lives up.

379
00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:02.880
Once again,

380
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.080
let the loss go.

381
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.300
What possible ways did they have to handle this during the war?

382
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:13.890
Nothing because the confusion over casualties of war,

383
00:18:13.891 --> 00:18:17.160
which always happens in war time was overwhelming.

384
00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.580
If a family got a message saying your husband,

385
00:18:20.581 --> 00:18:21.091
your brother,

386
00:18:21.091 --> 00:18:21.601
your son,

387
00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:23.310
your fiance is missing in action,

388
00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:24.420
it could mean anything.

389
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.840
It could mean that the individual was in a prison camp on the other side of the

390
00:18:30.121 --> 00:18:30.750
line.

391
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.880
It could mean that the individual was in a hospital.

392
00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:37.410
It could mean that there was a confusion of identity and that the person was

393
00:18:37.411 --> 00:18:38.071
still alive,

394
00:18:38.071 --> 00:18:38.371
but,

395
00:18:38.371 --> 00:18:38.610
uh,

396
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:40.350
somebody else found his dog tag.

397
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:44.670
It could mean that the person had been blown to pieces and there was nothing

398
00:18:44.671 --> 00:18:45.480
that remained of him.

399
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.670
None of that could be sorted out until the end of the war.

400
00:18:47.671 --> 00:18:48.241
And even then,

401
00:18:48.241 --> 00:18:49.290
it couldn't be sorted out.

402
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:51.420
The loss of knowledge,

403
00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:55.500
the lack of knowledge about the most fundamental question of war is the most

404
00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:59.100
poignant origin of a series of commemorative practices and followed it.

405
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:00.181
Now,

406
00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:02.730
given the scale of the losses,

407
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:07.440
the conventional churches were not able to handle the problem of helping the

408
00:19:07.441 --> 00:19:11.970
bereaved or those who were as it were in no man's land in purgatory.

409
00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:13.531
In fact,

410
00:19:13.531 --> 00:19:15.330
purgatory is an interesting idea.

411
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:16.531
If you think about it,

412
00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:20.160
it's center to a certain kind of popular Catholicism in the 19th century.

413
00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:23.160
Purgatory means that people who are,

414
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.190
um,

415
00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.000
on the way to heaven have to wait awhile and maybe,

416
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:30.210
maybe just the good works that you and I might do will help them get there

417
00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:31.350
sooner rather than later.

418
00:19:31.351 --> 00:19:32.430
It's a medieval idea.

419
00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:35.520
The Catholic Church had to jettison the idea of purgatory,

420
00:19:35.521 --> 00:19:39.810
which died in the first world war because no one wanted to put up with the idea

421
00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:43.410
that an individual who died for his country had a wait for a hundred years in

422
00:19:43.411 --> 00:19:45.210
purgatory in order to be able to get to heaven.

423
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:50.450
Religious practices had to change to handle the unprecedented losses of war.

424
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.660
Those who went to the churches for solace found very little because it was very

425
00:19:54.661 --> 00:19:54.931
little.

426
00:19:54.931 --> 00:19:56.100
The churchmen could do,

427
00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:57.510
could say,

428
00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.000
why did I lose three sons?

429
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:01.380
What did they die for?

430
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:02.670
The phrases,

431
00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:07.670
the knowable phrases of patriotism last only so long and most of the time don't

432
00:20:08.131 --> 00:20:09.300
get you through the night.

433
00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:10.561
Well,

434
00:20:10.561 --> 00:20:12.000
what individuals do,

435
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:16.830
the first thing they did was to move to the pagan perimeters of Christianity.

436
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:23.160
John Merriman referred you to a wonderful film by Ebell Goss about the return of

437
00:20:23.161 --> 00:20:25.880
the dead called Jacuzzi.

438
00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:26.340
Accused,

439
00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.540
which is accusing war,

440
00:20:27.541 --> 00:20:31.680
accusing the sign of not stopping wars accusing everybody of this insanity,

441
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:32.640
uh,

442
00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.720
had no end to it.

443
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:34.973
Well,

444
00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.980
the pagan perimeters of Christianity is the area are the areas where the,

445
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:41.070
the,

446
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.580
um,

447
00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:42.690
the account lives.

448
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:47.110
It's the areas where people believe photo Mya,

449
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:50.170
they have no choice in extra sensory perception.

450
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:51.011
Now,

451
00:20:51.011 --> 00:20:54.130
this is a period not just of the film industry,

452
00:20:54.131 --> 00:20:56.470
but the emergence of radio.

453
00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.450
It's a,

454
00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.141
uh,

455
00:20:59.141 --> 00:21:00.070
a world where,

456
00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:00.430
uh,

457
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:04.510
telegraphy was the quite normal means of communication with their underground

458
00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:05.290
cables,

459
00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:08.440
Reuters dispatched stories all over the world.

460
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.660
So for millions of families,

461
00:21:10.661 --> 00:21:14.620
the idea of getting in touch with the missing or the dad is seemed quite

462
00:21:14.621 --> 00:21:15.454
appealing.

463
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:17.410
And these are not fools.

464
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.640
These are not people who are,

465
00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:19.630
as it were,

466
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:22.720
bought by the Elmer Gantries of this world.

467
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.920
These are ordinary people or very intelligent people who are prepared to suspend

468
00:21:26.921 --> 00:21:31.150
disbelief about extra sensory perception in order to be able to find some

469
00:21:31.151 --> 00:21:31.984
solace,

470
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.600
some way of understanding the world in which they lived.

471
00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.610
It wasn't extraordinary.

472
00:21:36.611 --> 00:21:39.610
Efflorescence development of spiritualism,

473
00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:40.930
of seances.

474
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.520
One of the great carriers of this message was Arthur Conan Doyle,

475
00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.100
who was the author of the great,

476
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.460
the ultimate rationalist Sherlock Holmes.

477
00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.800
But when his son died and was missing,

478
00:21:53.801 --> 00:21:54.850
completely missing,

479
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:59.560
he became one of the great figures in the development of the spiritualist

480
00:21:59.561 --> 00:22:00.394
movement.

481
00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:04.330
Churches have no part in that because speaking to the dad has no mediation.

482
00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.480
Christianity couldn't be interested in this.

483
00:22:07.481 --> 00:22:08.560
Jewish religion has not,

484
00:22:08.561 --> 00:22:09.430
no time for it.

485
00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:11.740
Islam has no time for it whatsoever,

486
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:16.450
but it just shows you that the scale of the catastrophe of human loss and the

487
00:22:16.451 --> 00:22:21.451
first world war challenged conventional institutions and frameworks for

488
00:22:21.791 --> 00:22:23.230
understanding what was happening.

489
00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:24.881
Well,

490
00:22:24.881 --> 00:22:25.100
if,

491
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:30.100
if sounds are a kind of collective remembrance they created as it were,

492
00:22:32.621 --> 00:22:37.120
the precedent for the ones that have laughed their most powerful marks,

493
00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.610
not only on Europe but beyond it as well,

494
00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:41.410
and these are war memorials.

495
00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.050
The need to create a,

496
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.630
I said we're a substitute tomb,

497
00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:51.640
a substitute place in which in front of which to mourn is what creates the

498
00:22:51.641 --> 00:22:54.010
extraordinary vogue of war memorials.

499
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:58.510
And you don't have to go very far to see them or you have to do is go through

500
00:22:58.511 --> 00:23:03.400
Commons and you'll see two or memorials that were created at the same moment

501
00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.500
right after the first world war.

502
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:08.620
When you see the names of civil war,

503
00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.900
that's who were Yale man.

504
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:13.270
When you go through Commons on the walls,

505
00:23:13.271 --> 00:23:18.271
you should recognize that that was completed in the 1920s at the same time as

506
00:23:18.341 --> 00:23:19.420
there is a facade,

507
00:23:19.421 --> 00:23:24.370
a war memorial in front of Commons with the names of the battles that American

508
00:23:24.371 --> 00:23:25.420
soldiers fought in.

509
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.620
In front of that is a cenotaph and the cenotaph,

510
00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.880
an empty tomb says that these men died for liberty and so on,

511
00:23:33.881 --> 00:23:35.320
but it is an empty tomb.

512
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.270
This is the critical point to bear in mind.

513
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:42.070
The enormous development of commemorative forms in particular sculpture,

514
00:23:42.071 --> 00:23:46.760
architectural war memorials in the 20th century comes from the first world war.

515
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.220
Anyone who goes,

516
00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:54.080
and I think it's marvelous that we can talk about this in this particular room.

517
00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:58.760
Anyone who goes to see Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial,

518
00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:02.180
we'll see an outcome of a lecture on First World War commemoration that took

519
00:24:02.181 --> 00:24:05.300
place in this room where Maya Lin was a student.

520
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.570
She studied first world war memorials.

521
00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:10.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

522
00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.640
<v 0>In order to create the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.</v>

523
00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:13.513
Why?

524
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:15.670
If you go to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial,

525
00:24:15.671 --> 00:24:17.170
you'll understand the genius,

526
00:24:17.171 --> 00:24:18.670
the first World War commemoration,

527
00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:20.830
the only thing that matters,

528
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:22.030
author names,

529
00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:27.540
the names are what matters and the highly polished granite surface in the

530
00:24:27.611 --> 00:24:32.611
Vietnam veterans memorial has your own reflection forced back upon you to touch

531
00:24:34.661 --> 00:24:35.530
the names,

532
00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.790
is the way to find a means inadequate,

533
00:24:39.791 --> 00:24:44.200
perhaps symbolic perhaps to bring the dead back home,

534
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:48.550
to bring them to the center of American history in the middle of the mall at the

535
00:24:48.551 --> 00:24:52.810
intersection between the Lincoln memorial and the Washington Memorial.

536
00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:58.530
It is an extraordinary gathering together of the bones of the remains of the

537
00:24:59.981 --> 00:25:03.850
dead who were buried in Europe or never found.

538
00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.050
Now,

539
00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:05.920
why does this matter?

540
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:09.700
It matters because the universalization of mourning,

541
00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:14.650
a bereavement in the first world war meant that these war memorials are all over

542
00:25:14.651 --> 00:25:15.110
Europe.

543
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:16.150
They're everywhere.

544
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:19.810
There are 38,000 of them in England.

545
00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.610
Every village has one.

546
00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:22.890
Every commune,

547
00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.670
I think bar 12 in all of France,

548
00:25:24.671 --> 00:25:27.280
there 30,000 of them in France alone.

549
00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:31.480
And these war memorials are extraordinary in many respects,

550
00:25:31.481 --> 00:25:32.950
and I want to tell you about them today.

551
00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:40.530
There are places where next Tuesday on the 11th of November,

552
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:45.600
there will be ceremonies in France,

553
00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:47.890
the mayor of the town,

554
00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:49.151
it's a holiday,

555
00:25:49.151 --> 00:25:50.590
it's a public holiday in France.

556
00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:54.280
The mayor of the town will be at the head of a procession and in this,

557
00:25:54.281 --> 00:25:54.701
by the way,

558
00:25:54.701 --> 00:25:57.790
is choreographed all over the country in which there will be,

559
00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:01.480
oh a hundred school children who will march in the rain and the sleet.

560
00:26:01.481 --> 00:26:03.880
It doesn't matter to the local war memorial.

561
00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:09.400
And what happens then is that the mayor reads out the names of those from a

562
00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:14.401
small village or from a town who died in the first world war and the children in

563
00:26:14.681 --> 00:26:17.890
the school after the name of Cohen.

564
00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:19.000
All Dow will say,

565
00:26:19.001 --> 00:26:19.870
praise song.

566
00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:23.140
We'll answer for the man who aren't there.

567
00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.070
This bonding between the living and the dead,

568
00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:30.940
the bringing back of the bed to their own villages,

569
00:26:30.941 --> 00:26:35.941
to their homes was a substitute burial ceremony for the ones that could never

570
00:26:36.371 --> 00:26:37.204
take place.

571
00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.490
Now,

572
00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:40.420
how did it all happen?

573
00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:46.530
The first point that has to be made is that the commemorative wave took place

574
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:52.430
through political leadership and politics means many things.

575
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:57.270
The first thing it has to mean is that there is a fundamental difference between

576
00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:01.920
the way in which men are remembered in the winners and the losers.

577
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:06.450
In the case of Germany where they were 2 million soldiers who died in the first

578
00:27:06.451 --> 00:27:06.721
world war,

579
00:27:06.721 --> 00:27:08.670
this is an enormously difficult problem.

580
00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:15.280
The reason is that you not only need to remember the dead,

581
00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:20.670
but you have to find a way and a form to answer on an eternal question.

582
00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:24.130
The question is,

583
00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:29.340
how is it possible to glorify those who die in war without glorifying war

584
00:27:30.581 --> 00:27:31.414
itself?

585
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.150
The extraordinary wave of commemorative activity,

586
00:27:36.151 --> 00:27:40.800
the cultural practices of commemoration that were universal in Europe in the

587
00:27:40.801 --> 00:27:44.460
1920s and 1930s have many different answers to it,

588
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:48.930
but most of the time what happens is that politics became local.

589
00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:54.620
That small groups of people in small towns and villages took it upon themselves.

590
00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:56.310
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

591
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:57.420
<v 0>To answer the question,</v>

592
00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.620
what will we do?

593
00:27:58.621 --> 00:28:00.960
How will we remember the men of our village

594
00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:06.030
and given the numbers we're talking about three,

595
00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:09.390
four brothers in agrarian towns,

596
00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:12.030
we're talking about fathers and sons who never came back.

597
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:16.830
We're talking about the absolutely personal face to face,

598
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.470
culture of village life.

599
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.630
Everyone knew the names,

600
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.730
everybody knew the families.

601
00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:24.980
Uh,

602
00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:29.980
what this means is that it may be the case that high politics set out certain

603
00:28:31.111 --> 00:28:31.944
lines,

604
00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.211
the cabinets,

605
00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:33.961
the politicians,

606
00:28:33.961 --> 00:28:34.794
the generals.

607
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:38.820
But what's extraordinary about Europe between the wars is how democratic

608
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:41.910
commemoration was and how much life,

609
00:28:41.911 --> 00:28:45.750
there wasn't civil society in order to create forms that were separate.

610
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:47.490
That's why I mentioned the Poppy Fund.

611
00:28:47.491 --> 00:28:48.930
This is a private organization.

612
00:28:48.931 --> 00:28:50.100
It's not a public charity.

613
00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:51.000
It's not the state.

614
00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.640
It's civil society is speaking.

615
00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:58.680
It's compassionate language of remembering not only the fallen but those left

616
00:28:58.681 --> 00:28:59.401
behind the widows,

617
00:28:59.401 --> 00:29:00.330
the orphans and so on.

618
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:06.360
Now I'll give you an example of how civil society and state power differ and

619
00:29:06.361 --> 00:29:07.194
vary.

620
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.290
On the 14th of July,

621
00:29:10.291 --> 00:29:15.291
1919 just two weeks after the signing of the peace treaty on the 28th of June,

622
00:29:16.231 --> 00:29:19.350
1919 when the Germans were forced to accept the terms of the treaty of

623
00:29:19.351 --> 00:29:20.184
Versailles,

624
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:25.250
there was a victory parade in Paris and that victory parade had a march pastor.

625
00:29:26.581 --> 00:29:29.490
The Sean's the Lycee through the Arc de Triomphe.

626
00:29:29.491 --> 00:29:33.210
It's only happened twice in history and this was one of them to celebrate the

627
00:29:33.211 --> 00:29:34.044
victory.

628
00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.580
French were there,

629
00:29:35.581 --> 00:29:36.600
the Americans were there,

630
00:29:36.601 --> 00:29:37.530
the Brits were there,

631
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:39.600
the Italians were there.

632
00:29:39.601 --> 00:29:40.680
All the allies were there.

633
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:42.940
Now the two things that happened,

634
00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:44.830
one was that George claim,

635
00:29:44.831 --> 00:29:48.940
also the French prime minister decided in this spectacle we need as a worse

636
00:29:48.941 --> 00:29:50.560
symbol of the lost generation.

637
00:29:50.561 --> 00:29:52.240
So he had a paper,

638
00:29:52.241 --> 00:29:52.991
Mashiach Cata,

639
00:29:52.991 --> 00:29:54.730
Ofac built very big,

640
00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:56.800
ornate plinth.

641
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:58.480
And on top of it was a Santa Taf,

642
00:29:58.481 --> 00:30:03.481
an empty tomb to symbolize the tombs of all those soldiers who died in the war,

643
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.710
half of whom have no known graves.

644
00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:11.520
And to start the victory parade Claremont's so insisted that the people who lead

645
00:30:13.001 --> 00:30:18.001
the way are the most badly mutilated men of the war.

646
00:30:18.311 --> 00:30:20.620
The Google car say the men with broken faces,

647
00:30:20.621 --> 00:30:21.910
the man without arms,

648
00:30:21.911 --> 00:30:22.840
the men without legs,

649
00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:28.320
and the use of this vanguard of the suffering transformed a victory parade into

650
00:30:31.391 --> 00:30:32.350
a day of mourning.

651
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.180
This was extraordinary.

652
00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:35.560
It was absent extraordinary.

653
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:41.050
The Brits decided if there's going to be something on the 14th of July,

654
00:30:41.051 --> 00:30:42.070
we better do something to,

655
00:30:42.071 --> 00:30:45.280
and it'll take five days for us to get everybody back over the 19th of July,

656
00:30:45.281 --> 00:30:46.114
we need,

657
00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.010
we need a victory parade too,

658
00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:51.550
because three quarters of a million British men died in the war,

659
00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.370
another 250,000 from the empire and so on.

660
00:30:54.371 --> 00:30:57.890
Dominion's a million man for the British forces died in the first role.

661
00:30:57.910 --> 00:30:58.870
We need a victory parade.

662
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.150
So they asked the architect,

663
00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:04.510
Edmund luncheons to put together another paper,

664
00:31:04.511 --> 00:31:07.430
Pinochet Memorial call the Cenotaph,

665
00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.620
an empty tomb.

666
00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:13.990
And they put it right in the middle of Whitehall official London,

667
00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:17.740
right next to 10 Downing Street next to Buckingham Palace.

668
00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:18.401
You know,

669
00:31:18.401 --> 00:31:19.510
basically a,

670
00:31:19.511 --> 00:31:23.320
a small stroll down to the houses of parliament right in the middle of official

671
00:31:23.321 --> 00:31:24.154
London.

672
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.870
And they had their parade,

673
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.670
but that wasn't the end of it.

674
00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:32.790
2 million people came to it and they all deposited whatever they had to offer to

675
00:31:34.481 --> 00:31:37.240
the debt of the Great War because this was an empty tomb.

676
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.900
Now it wasn't the empty tomb of Christ,

677
00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.480
it was a Greek form.

678
00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:48.780
And this drove the churchmen leading the Church of England apoplectic because it

679
00:31:49.061 --> 00:31:53.350
meant that the language of commemoration was ecumenical and not Christian.

680
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:54.940
And why should that be?

681
00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.820
Lachance was the man who designed New Delhi.

682
00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:00.430
He was the architect of empire,

683
00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:05.290
and he wanted a memorial that would suffice for Hindu soldiers who had died,

684
00:32:05.291 --> 00:32:06.370
Muslim soldiers,

685
00:32:06.371 --> 00:32:07.300
Jewish soldiers,

686
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:08.351
Anglican,

687
00:32:08.351 --> 00:32:08.921
Catholic,

688
00:32:08.921 --> 00:32:09.341
IRS,

689
00:32:09.341 --> 00:32:09.901
whatever,

690
00:32:09.901 --> 00:32:11.470
or people have no belief at all.

691
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:12.303
And he found it.

692
00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.490
He found the simplest possible way.

693
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:20.350
And as a result of this extraordinary outpouring of feeling literally flowers.

694
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.340
They kept on having to shovel them away because there was so many things left.

695
00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:25.930
Understandably.

696
00:32:25.931 --> 00:32:30.931
These are families who finally found a way to express perhaps a form of symbolic

697
00:32:32.201 --> 00:32:32.861
exchange.

698
00:32:32.861 --> 00:32:34.630
It happens in the Vietnam Wall.

699
00:32:34.631 --> 00:32:35.740
Two people leave things.

700
00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:38.680
Why these people whose names are on the wall,

701
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:44.300
those people who died represented by the Cenotaph have given everything I need

702
00:32:44.301 --> 00:32:46.220
to give something pilgrimages hard.

703
00:32:46.221 --> 00:32:47.090
It's not tourism.

704
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:48.440
It should be difficult and you should.

705
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:49.333
You should give,

706
00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:50.570
not just get.

707
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.961
Now,

708
00:32:50.961 --> 00:32:55.130
the critical thing there is that clearly the British people voted with their

709
00:32:55.131 --> 00:32:56.780
feet for the national war memorial.

710
00:32:56.781 --> 00:32:59.150
So the cabinet says things,

711
00:32:59.151 --> 00:33:00.860
could you do it again this time in stone?

712
00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.113
And he did.

713
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:07.280
He did it again and stone and a year later when the unknown soldier was buried

714
00:33:07.281 --> 00:33:08.360
in Westminster Abbey,

715
00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:10.160
where did people go?

716
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.750
They went and paid their respects.

717
00:33:11.751 --> 00:33:12.890
You can still do it today.

718
00:33:12.891 --> 00:33:15.110
The IB is the home of kings and poets.

719
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.960
Now the people's monument is the Cenotaph in London,

720
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.840
in Whitehall,

721
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:21.020
not the Church of the kings,

722
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:25.460
but it's the sacred space of the people and it remains.

723
00:33:25.461 --> 00:33:26.570
So to this day.

724
00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:32.200
Now that man Edwin luncheons designed another set of war memorials that lead us

725
00:33:33.261 --> 00:33:34.790
directly to Myelin.

726
00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.000
Tepe fall,

727
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:36.221
t,

728
00:33:36.221 --> 00:33:41.120
h I e p via email as a small village that no longer exists in the psalm in

729
00:33:41.121 --> 00:33:41.990
northern France.

730
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:47.710
And there he was asked 18 years later to do a memorial for the 73,000 British

731
00:33:47.781 --> 00:33:50.690
soldiers who died in that one battle and have known own graves.

732
00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.260
And what he created was an extraordinary arch,

733
00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:59.060
an arch of triumph that basically has small arches on top of it.

734
00:33:59.061 --> 00:33:59.894
And then nothing,

735
00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.650
he reduced the arch of triumph to nothingness.

736
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:06.860
And the only thing you do is when you walk up to it.

737
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:08.720
My eyesight is dreadful,

738
00:34:08.721 --> 00:34:10.250
but younger people do it too.

739
00:34:10.251 --> 00:34:11.084
It just depends.

740
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:12.950
When you get close.

741
00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:13.971
For me,

742
00:34:13.971 --> 00:34:15.590
it's very close for other people,

743
00:34:15.591 --> 00:34:16.341
it's further away.

744
00:34:16.341 --> 00:34:20.210
You all of a sudden see that the walls are this arch that he built and teeth vol

745
00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.970
are completely covered with names.

746
00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.220
There's a vanishing point.

747
00:34:25.221 --> 00:34:26.780
We suddenly see them from a distance.

748
00:34:26.781 --> 00:34:27.291
You can't see,

749
00:34:27.291 --> 00:34:28.490
it just looks like a facade.

750
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:33.710
They heard the names and it's that which Myelin heard about in this lecture hall

751
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:40.640
when Vincent Scully talked about luncheons and commemoration that inspired her

752
00:34:40.641 --> 00:34:42.950
to create the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.

753
00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.730
She's told me what it felt like to sit in this room and do it.

754
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:48.380
She actually submitted her,

755
00:34:48.381 --> 00:34:49.700
designed for that memorial,

756
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:50.870
uh,

757
00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:53.840
as the design that was ultimately,

758
00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:54.300
uh,

759
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:54.681
the,

760
00:34:54.681 --> 00:34:58.670
the winning design in the competition that was anonymous by the way.

761
00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:01.100
She got a B plus for it in her class.

762
00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:02.630
I'll leave that aside.

763
00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:04.640
Judgment is mine,

764
00:35:04.641 --> 00:35:05.474
Sayeth the Lord.

765
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:06.080
All I can,

766
00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:06.980
all I can do,

767
00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:11.950
all I can do is to tell you that the forms that were created in the cenotaph

768
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:17.060
were ones that have endured throughout the 20th century to describe how war is

769
00:35:17.061 --> 00:35:17.894
remembered.

770
00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:19.280
And now the cenotaph,

771
00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:19.851
as I say,

772
00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:20.960
is Pre-christian.

773
00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:25.670
It's one more move away from the institutionalization of religion.

774
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:29.990
And it's not that the sacred died in 20th century Europe.

775
00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:31.550
It moved out of the churches.

776
00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.410
It can be found elsewhere.

777
00:35:33.411 --> 00:35:38.100
And one of the places where it will be found next Tuesday is in front of war

778
00:35:38.101 --> 00:35:41.730
memorials that were placed all over villages,

779
00:35:41.731 --> 00:35:42.564
towns,

780
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.560
marketplaces,

781
00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:44.550
all over Europe.

782
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:45.990
So let me return to that process.

783
00:35:45.991 --> 00:35:47.220
The first I said is political,

784
00:35:47.221 --> 00:35:48.330
small groups of people,

785
00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:49.501
the busy bodies,

786
00:35:49.501 --> 00:35:52.830
the committee man that always exist in small towns with nothing better to do

787
00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:56.310
retired men or men of leisure or sometimes women.

788
00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.380
And what they did was they wanted to know,

789
00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:59.820
we want to design,

790
00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:01.110
design this ourselves.

791
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.970
Well the first thing you have to figure out is how much does it cost?

792
00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:11.250
And hence we should always recognize the commemoration is a business and the

793
00:36:11.251 --> 00:36:13.800
cost factor actually matters substantially.

794
00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:18.540
The reason why it matters substantially is that if you want something

795
00:36:18.541 --> 00:36:19.201
sculptural,

796
00:36:19.201 --> 00:36:21.570
if you want something like a piece of architecture,

797
00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:26.190
the cheapest possible form of stone is an obelisk.

798
00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:27.181
You know,

799
00:36:27.181 --> 00:36:29.010
you don't have to do much and just hack it here,

800
00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.000
there and that's it.

801
00:36:30.001 --> 00:36:31.500
And it has a great advantage,

802
00:36:31.501 --> 00:36:33.100
which is that it's Egyptian has pre-christian.

803
00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:33.541
Again,

804
00:36:33.541 --> 00:36:36.570
it doesn't require you to distinguish between Protestant Catholics,

805
00:36:36.571 --> 00:36:36.811
Jews,

806
00:36:36.811 --> 00:36:37.650
or anybody else.

807
00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:41.220
It's an ecumenical form and it's the most popular one.

808
00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:45.420
The second problem is that in France in particular,

809
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:46.830
Germany has its own headaches,

810
00:36:46.831 --> 00:36:47.880
but in France in particular,

811
00:36:47.881 --> 00:36:52.500
church and state had been separated in 19 five and rather violently separated,

812
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:53.940
no crosses,

813
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.790
except in some Catholic areas where they said,

814
00:36:56.791 --> 00:36:57.660
I don't really care.

815
00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.010
We're going to have a cross no matter what.

816
00:36:59.011 --> 00:37:01.440
Which is true in Catholic Brittany in the northwest of the country,

817
00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:03.660
but most of the time they're not crosses.

818
00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:07.920
What they show primarily are two kinds of representations.

819
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:11.220
The first is of a gallic rooster,

820
00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:16.650
which again could be bought through a mail order catalog or a soldier.

821
00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:17.430
The poor Lou,

822
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:18.263
the French,

823
00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:22.260
the British like to see their soldiers shaved for the,

824
00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:22.981
for the French.

825
00:37:22.981 --> 00:37:26.250
The idea of a soldier should be somebody who was a hairy one while lose somebody

826
00:37:26.251 --> 00:37:27.150
who never shaved.

827
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:28.200
So having a bar,

828
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.880
a beard is being masculine,

829
00:37:29.881 --> 00:37:30.750
being a tough guy,

830
00:37:30.751 --> 00:37:32.220
being a soldier who won the war.

831
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:36.180
So upwa Lou could be bought again on a made a mail order catalog.

832
00:37:36.181 --> 00:37:37.530
But overwhelmingly,

833
00:37:37.531 --> 00:37:39.180
and this is a very important point,

834
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:43.770
overwhelmingly the images are not triumphal.

835
00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:46.740
There are more painful and again these,

836
00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:50.070
these were decided by small groups of people who put together money in order to

837
00:37:50.071 --> 00:37:54.030
describe the ways in which war memorials should be organized,

838
00:37:54.031 --> 00:37:54.960
should be designed,

839
00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:56.540
and indeed should be paid for,

840
00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:00.570
and they were paid for by popular subscription overwhelmingly panties,

841
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:03.730
Su Frank's deutschmarks,

842
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:04.380
whatever,

843
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.280
whatever you had.

844
00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.540
That's the way it was done.

845
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:09.690
Now what about the inscriptions?

846
00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:10.381
Once more,

847
00:38:10.381 --> 00:38:14.370
I want to reinforce the point that I made earlier about the democratic nature of

848
00:38:14.371 --> 00:38:15.204
loss.

849
00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:20.480
95% of war memorials list people either alphabetically or by the year or the

850
00:38:22.201 --> 00:38:23.760
time in which they died,

851
00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.080
the sequence of their death.

852
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:29.880
Only 5% of all war memorials in Europe that I've ever seen and I've tried to

853
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:34.260
collect material all over the place on this have men listed by rank.

854
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:40.320
There is a democracy of death and of commemoration in highly any Galitary in

855
00:38:42.891 --> 00:38:43.724
societies.

856
00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:46.210
There was something extraordinary that goes on when,

857
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.250
when loss is so general,

858
00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:53.280
it becomes apparent that it isn't possible to separate those who died in uniform

859
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:55.150
from those who,

860
00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:55.630
uh,

861
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:58.210
who in a high rank or from those who died,

862
00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:58.900
uh,

863
00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:00.070
as private soldiers.

864
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:01.630
Now,

865
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:06.630
one important point to bear in mind is that once the choice of place was made

866
00:39:07.061 --> 00:39:10.870
and the choice of form was made and the money was preserved,

867
00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:11.370
uh,

868
00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:11.640
was,

869
00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:12.060
was,

870
00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:12.490
uh,

871
00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:16.650
gathered together and paid to the artist or the sculpture sculptor who would,

872
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:17.503
who would do this,

873
00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:18.640
then we come to the,

874
00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:19.570
as it were,

875
00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:20.090
the,

876
00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:20.690
uh,

877
00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:23.530
the third part of the commemorative process.

878
00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:24.760
The first is political,

879
00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:28.030
and by that I mean small politics more than big politics.

880
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:30.010
The second is business,

881
00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:31.203
the money,

882
00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:32.560
the commissioning,

883
00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:33.430
uh,

884
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:34.840
the putting together of the project.

885
00:39:34.841 --> 00:39:36.550
But the third is the ritual.

886
00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:40.720
What do people do when they stand in front of a war memorial?

887
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:43.540
And the answer is very different things.

888
00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:49.590
The first thing that happens in the front of war memorials and it still happens,

889
00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.680
is that women enter the narrative of war.

890
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:57.820
Women are at the center of the commemorative practice.

891
00:39:57.821 --> 00:40:02.821
They are not at the center of the narratives of war from the battlefield or

892
00:40:04.151 --> 00:40:07.030
indeed from the military perspective itself.

893
00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:09.280
There are those who believe that that indeed,

894
00:40:09.281 --> 00:40:11.470
the gendering of the narratives of war,

895
00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:12.500
uh,

896
00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:16.380
separates the stories told by soldiers and novels and,

897
00:40:16.381 --> 00:40:16.781
and uh,

898
00:40:16.781 --> 00:40:17.614
and memoirs,

899
00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:18.161
uh,

900
00:40:18.161 --> 00:40:20.170
from those of the societies in which they,

901
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.170
for which they fought and,

902
00:40:21.171 --> 00:40:22.030
and for which they died.

903
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:23.770
I'm not sure if that is true or not,

904
00:40:23.771 --> 00:40:24.820
but what we can say,

905
00:40:24.821 --> 00:40:27.250
and there are thousands of photographs that show it,

906
00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:32.700
is that the ritual that happens in front of memorials are rituals of families.

907
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:35.560
And in conventional terms,

908
00:40:35.561 --> 00:40:39.700
by that I mean historically over determined ways.

909
00:40:39.701 --> 00:40:43.390
Women have been associated with morning practices since the Egyptians.

910
00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:44.760
There are tombs in the,

911
00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:45.860
in the queen,

912
00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:47.230
the valley of the Queens and lox,

913
00:40:47.231 --> 00:40:49.000
Luxor that's show professional mourners,

914
00:40:49.001 --> 00:40:51.580
women who have tears painted on there on the cheeks,

915
00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:52.030
uh,

916
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.863
from the,

917
00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:53.200
uh,

918
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.220
from the time of the pharaohs.

919
00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:55.870
Whether that is true or not.

920
00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:57.760
The notion of Mater Dolorosa,

921
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:59.740
you know Stabat Mater,

922
00:40:59.741 --> 00:41:00.431
his mother was,

923
00:41:00.431 --> 00:41:05.140
there is a Catholic trope of great power and importance in understanding how

924
00:41:05.141 --> 00:41:09.940
societies can figure loss of life and more so the first point is that women and

925
00:41:09.941 --> 00:41:11.230
children families are there.

926
00:41:11.231 --> 00:41:14.440
The second is there is a didactic function.

927
00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:18.370
School children come there and this I think is a very important point to bear in

928
00:41:18.371 --> 00:41:19.204
mind.

929
00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:23.320
Overwhelmingly this is true in Germany until the 1930s Italy.

930
00:41:23.321 --> 00:41:28.270
It's true until late 1920s and it's true all over Britain and France and

931
00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:29.620
certainly in the dominions.

932
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000
The rituals have a byword that dominate the message.

933
00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:41.680
It is never again the phrase we frequently associate with the Holocaust with war

934
00:41:44.031 --> 00:41:45.080
against genocide.

935
00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:47.091
Yes,

936
00:41:47.091 --> 00:41:47.924
that's true,

937
00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:53.560
but the phrase never again comes out of the first world war and it's what

938
00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:58.040
dominates the commemorative practices of the interwar period.

939
00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:00.650
This is the war to end all wars.

940
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:03.380
This is the war that makes war unimpossible.

941
00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:08.210
This is a war so dreadful that it is not at all the purpose of those who go to

942
00:42:08.211 --> 00:42:12.230
commemorative forms to prepare the next generation for their turn.

943
00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.490
On the contrary,

944
00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:17.270
the notion of commemoration and into war Europe is never again,

945
00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:22.670
and that explains I think why the commemorative power of the period around the

946
00:42:22.671 --> 00:42:26.810
first world war is not repeated after the second in France.

947
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:28.250
You can see this anywhere in Britain.

948
00:42:28.251 --> 00:42:28.941
It's there too.

949
00:42:28.941 --> 00:42:29.391
In Germany,

950
00:42:29.391 --> 00:42:31.760
they're more and more difficult reasons obviously to handle this,

951
00:42:31.761 --> 00:42:34.220
and in eastern Europe where the massacres was so gigantic,

952
00:42:34.221 --> 00:42:35.150
it's almost a possible,

953
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:39.170
but what happens in western Europe is that the names of those who die in the

954
00:42:39.171 --> 00:42:40.004
second world war,

955
00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:42.050
a tacked onto first world war memorials.

956
00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.660
Part of the reason is financial.

957
00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.730
If the first world war impoverished Europe,

958
00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:49.550
the Second World War bankrupted it and without the Marshall Plan,

959
00:42:49.551 --> 00:42:50.384
who knows?

960
00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:53.390
The important point is though that there's another reason.

961
00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:58.100
How many times can you say never again if the idea was that these men died to

962
00:42:58.101 --> 00:42:59.300
make war impossible.

963
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.050
In other words,

964
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:04.430
their sacrifices with such as to eliminate the need for their children to go

965
00:43:04.431 --> 00:43:04.971
water again.

966
00:43:04.971 --> 00:43:07.460
Then what do you do in 1939 and this is true by the way,

967
00:43:07.461 --> 00:43:10.220
in Germany to where night to the 1st of September,

968
00:43:10.221 --> 00:43:10.971
1939,

969
00:43:10.971 --> 00:43:14.330
the outbreak of the Second World War was not graded by marching bands and

970
00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:16.190
[inaudible] and parades and so on.

971
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:20.870
It was a day of sadness in Germany as it was elsewhere because everybody knew

972
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:26.390
and they knew because the great war had told them what war is.

973
00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:28.930
The conclusion I want to,

974
00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:29.180
uh,

975
00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:34.180
to draw on is this remembering the first world war has taken many different

976
00:43:35.301 --> 00:43:36.134
forms.

977
00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.810
I've dealt with a filmmaker mystification of it.

978
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:43.870
There's a big business in novels and memoirs in an area of what we might call

979
00:43:44.691 --> 00:43:47.090
factoids that are half fictional and half true.

980
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:48.111
Robert Graves,

981
00:43:48.111 --> 00:43:51.440
goodbye to all that is still in prince 80 years after he wrote it.

982
00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:55.490
There are many such novels all quiet on the western front that are,

983
00:43:55.491 --> 00:43:56.900
there were enormous bestsellers.

984
00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:00.050
We should accept the fact that the media matters.

985
00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:05.450
But I think the critical point to bear in mind is that the casualties of the of

986
00:44:05.451 --> 00:44:10.451
the first world war was so devastating that even the losses of the Second World

987
00:44:10.491 --> 00:44:12.140
War didn't change.

988
00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:18.130
The landscape of remembrance that was constructed between 1918 and 1939 war

989
00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:26.560
means something in Europe that it doesn't mean in this country and the reasons

990
00:44:26.871 --> 00:44:29.540
can be found in all of these commemorative practices.

991
00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:33.540
It is clear to me that political culture follows history,

992
00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:38.250
follows the understandings people develop of the world in which they live.

993
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:42.780
European see war differently from Americans and it doesn't stop there from being

994
00:44:42.781 --> 00:44:46.290
militaristic groups and those like the Nazis who wanted to get it right this

995
00:44:46.291 --> 00:44:50.730
time around and reverse the verdict of 1918 and under the treaty of Versailles.

996
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:52.000
But there's no,

997
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.580
no doubt in my mind that the first world war message of never again survived the

998
00:44:56.581 --> 00:45:01.581
Nazis survived Stalin to create a different kind of Europe in which armies don't

999
00:45:02.041 --> 00:45:02.940
matter anymore.

1000
00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:04.773
They're there.

1001
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:07.500
But in the question of a great historian,

1002
00:45:07.501 --> 00:45:11.520
James Sheehan from Stanford who just wrote a history of 20th century in the

1003
00:45:11.521 --> 00:45:13.080
question that he put in his title,

1004
00:45:13.081 --> 00:45:13.770
we have,

1005
00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:18.390
I think the final legacy of the commemoration of the first World War.

1006
00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:21.320
His book is entitled where have all the soldiers gone

1007
00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:25.020
in late 20th century Europe.

1008
00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:28.530
States are defined in terms of the way in which they defend the wellbeing of

1009
00:45:28.531 --> 00:45:29.520
their populations.

1010
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:34.410
No longer a states defined in terms of the military force that they can deploy

1011
00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:37.200
in defense of their national interests or their imperial power.

1012
00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:39.390
The first world war put,

1013
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:40.500
as it were,

1014
00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:45.500
the beginnings hammered in the nails in the coffin of the old vision that the

1015
00:45:45.691 --> 00:45:49.440
state is that institution which has the monopoly on the legitimate use of

1016
00:45:49.441 --> 00:45:50.370
physical force.

1017
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:55.350
The story of warfare killed the old idea of state sovereignty.

1018
00:45:56.430 --> 00:46:00.630
It wasn't dead before the Nazis made it necessary for us to develop something

1019
00:46:00.631 --> 00:46:01.464
different.

1020
00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:06.240
But it is the remembrance of the first World War which left traces in families,

1021
00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:11.940
which are the most powerful reasons why the first world war has become and

1022
00:46:11.941 --> 00:46:16.560
remains the iconic disaster that has created a Europe that no one had ever seen

1023
00:46:16.561 --> 00:46:17.394
before.

1024
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:21.330
And that was vastly different than the minds of ordinary people than the Europe

1025
00:46:21.331 --> 00:46:24.450
that existed in 1914 thank you very much.
