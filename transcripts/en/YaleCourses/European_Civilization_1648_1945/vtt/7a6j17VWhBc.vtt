1
00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.860
Got Complicated lecture,
they,
I to talk about nationalism.
Um,

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.970
and I do so with a skepticism that of course you'll,
uh,

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.820
you'll quickly pick up on,
uh,
uh,
aggressive nationalism,

4
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:17.280
help,
uh,
unleash the demons of the,

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.430
of the 20th century I beginning with where we're one,
which,

6
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.930
which unleashed even more dangerous demons,
uh,
uh,
after that.
Uh,

7
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:29.700
so I want to talk about,
um,
about nationalism and particularly I in,

8
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.560
in a little bit in France,
but,

9
00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:36.130
but I in places that one does it usually consider all ended up drawing on my,

10
00:00:36.131 --> 00:00:38.400
a friend Tim Snyder's work to talk a little bit about,

11
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.770
about Lithuania and Belarus and why they,
they're nationalisms.
Uh,

12
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:47.190
we're,
we're very,
very different in the,
in the,
in the second case,
uh,

13
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.020
I didn't really exist at all,
uh,
in the 19th century.
Uh,
and I'm going to,
um,

14
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.250
give a counter example,
um,
which of course is which I treat in the book,

15
00:00:56.251 --> 00:00:59.080
but of course it's the Austrian Hungarian Empire.
Uh,
and,

16
00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:02.820
and it's funny because one couldn't have imagined,
uh,

17
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.050
in the 1970s looking installs quickly back on the Austria Hungarian Empire,

18
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.520
this polyglot,
uh,
a Habsburg,
um,
uh,
regime,

19
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:13.440
but the horrors of the Balkans,

20
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.990
I really made lots of historians and other social scientists look back,

21
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.090
uh,
and try to figure out how it was that,
uh,

22
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.640
instead of asking why it was the Australian and Gary and empire collapsed during

23
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:29.490
World War One are really at the end of World War One.

24
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.610
A turning the question around and saying,
how did it hold together so long?

25
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:37.440
So the [inaudible] Gary and empire is sort of a counterexample to,
uh,

26
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:41.040
to these nationalisms.
And of course,
one of the things that,
that,
uh,

27
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.130
brought the empire down along with,

28
00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:48.131
with the war was a competing national claims from ethnic minorities,

29
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.130
uh,
uh,
within,
uh,
within that,
those fast domains.

30
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.160
But I want to start with,
with,
with a story.
It's something that I,

31
00:01:56.161 --> 00:01:58.650
it's a book I read,
uh,
um,

32
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.070
all it maybe five or six years ago and the histories have their history.

33
00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:03.700
So I'm going to tell,
uh,

34
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.250
the history of this particular book and you'll see kind of what I'm getting at.

35
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.630
And,
and the book,
by the way,
I sent out whenever you had a great idea,

36
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:15.960
emailed me saying,
why don't you send out the,
the terms before the lecture.

37
00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:18.180
So actually that was a great idea.
I'd never thought of that.

38
00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:22.070
And I did it last night,
a though I didn't put this particular book on it.
Um,

39
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.190
anyway,
the book is a Anastasia Caracas see,

40
00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:30.191
do have fields of wheat hills of blood passages to nationhood in Greek,

41
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:35.610
Macedonia 1870,
1990.

42
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:37.830
And when I say that history's have their own history,

43
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.090
what I mean is the following in this book,
uh,

44
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.120
this anthropologist a who is from both Turkish and Greek extraction on either

45
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:53.330
side of her family is writing a book about a,

46
00:02:53.331 --> 00:02:57.810
a small part of Macedonia in Macedonia of course,

47
00:02:57.811 --> 00:03:01.980
was heavily contested centuries.
Uh,
it was,
uh,
you know,

48
00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:06.250
in the middle of a trade route went through it,
uh,
in Macedonia,
there were,

49
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.640
were Turks and the,

50
00:03:07.641 --> 00:03:12.641
and there were Serbs and they were Bulgarians and Macedonians and Greeks.

51
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.180
And for centuries they'd all basically gotten along,
uh,
uh,

52
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.300
as that part of,
of,
of the Balkans,
as you know,

53
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:25.910
path was under the Ottoman Empire.
And then,
uh,

54
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.790
through a whole series of,
of,
uh,
of,
of,
of arrangements that,
that,
uh,

55
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:35.500
of wars,
the Balkan wars before World War One,
a pass the back and forth.

56
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.050
Um,
and,
and,
and,
and essentially that,

57
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:42.090
that is one of the points of the book is that basically people,
uh,
uh,

58
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.950
go along very,
very well.
But that gradually what happened is that,
uh,

59
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.960
among competing national claims that part of Macedonia became seen by Greeks as

60
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:57.790
part of greater Greece.
Now,

61
00:03:57.791 --> 00:04:02.791
whenever you heard the term greater Greece or Greater Serbia or greater Germany

62
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.060
or greater anything a lookout because what that means is that in the imaginary

63
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.530
of,
uh,
in,
in,
in the view of,
of nationalists,

64
00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:19.030
particularly aggressive nationalists,
uh,
that parts of,
of,

65
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.893
um,

66
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.730
that territories that have large percentages of a certain ethnic group or even

67
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:26.080
in some cases only minorities,

68
00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:30.790
but in other cases majority's should it be included,
uh,
uh,

69
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.800
Numat come,
what may I in,
uh,
in,
uh,
in,

70
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.700
in,
in the,
the greater state of that particular ethnic group.

71
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.700
If you take the example of volt and Kosovo has about a 85% of the population,

72
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.860
uh,
are,
is made up of,
of,
of Muslims,
of Albanian Muslims.
And of course,

73
00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:55.630
Kosovo,
uh,
his,
his was part of Serbia.
And when,

74
00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.250
when,
when Maclossa Vich,
uh,
was talking about Greater Serbia,

75
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.230
Greater Serbia for him could not exist unless this Kosovo with his 85% of people

76
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:09.580
who weren't served was included in that.
Well,
anyway,
that's another story.

77
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.480
Um,

78
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.950
but what happened with this particular book is that when this book was in

79
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:17.650
manuscript arguing that,

80
00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:22.480
that basically the idea that Macedonia was Greek was a construction,

81
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.930
was an invention and invented identity by Greek nationalists.

82
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.310
Uh,
the press,
the university press,

83
00:05:30.311 --> 00:05:32.590
I guess I shouldn't say since this is being recorded,

84
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.380
I shouldn't say which one that was,
um,

85
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.680
chicken down and decided not to publish the book.
Uh,

86
00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:42.350
they at one point got a bomb threat saying that,

87
00:05:42.351 --> 00:05:46.990
that from Greek nationalists a thing that I,
if you publish this book,

88
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.130
uh,
we will blow up your offices in Europe.
Bam.
So,
uh,
they,

89
00:05:51.131 --> 00:05:56.050
they chickened out a and quite,
you know,
in a,
in a example of just utter,

90
00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.690
you know,
cowardice refused to publish the book.
And so they sent this author am,

91
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.970
I don't know,
I've read the book.
It's a really terrific book.
I,
and said,
you know,

92
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.050
sorry,
uh,
we're not going to publish your book too bad contract or no contract.

93
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.490
So University of Chicago Press published the book and uh,
uh,

94
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:16.130
when the book came out,
this particular author,
uh,

95
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:20.720
received a lot of hate mail and she received a picture of herself with a picture

96
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:25.160
of,
uh,
of,
of,
of a Greek flag stuck through where her heart would be.

97
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.470
So these are fairly serious threats.

98
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.120
So the point of that is not to jump on Greek nationalists,
uh,

99
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.090
or unserved a nationalist.
So that is certainly the Serbian nationalists.

100
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:38.250
Ultra nationalists have done just an incredible amount of damage in the,
uh,

101
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.200
in the Balkans and over the past,
uh,
the past decades,

102
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:45.470
but merely to underlying the point that,

103
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.390
that national identities are constructed.
And one of the most useful,

104
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.830
they're invented there are in way imaginary.
Uh,

105
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:58.250
and one of the most interesting sort of historical things you can do as an

106
00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:01.010
historian is to try to figure out what from where do these,
these,

107
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.780
these identities come.
Now,
language pay plays a lot of it.
Maybe if I have time,

108
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.430
I'll,
cause I've got to do a lot today,

109
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.640
but this is more of a conversation than a lecture.
If I have time,

110
00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:13.400
I might talk a little bit about about language,
the in the case of France,

111
00:07:13.401 --> 00:07:16.760
but he'd doing feel like most people talking about nationalism.

112
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.890
I'm drawing on some of the thinking of Benedict Anderson and his concept of

113
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.670
that,
uh,
nationalism in the construction of,

114
00:07:25.671 --> 00:07:27.890
of national [inaudible] identity.

115
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.890
I represents imagine communities because basically if you,
uh,

116
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.860
if you consider yourself a member of x nationality,

117
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.110
you are,
uh,

118
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.100
you are creating links or you're agreeing to links with people whom you don't

119
00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:46.520
know.
People that live in Portland,
Oregon or people that live in Albuquerque,

120
00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:49.790
New Mexico or people that live in New Jersey,

121
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:54.470
even though we are sitting here in Connecticut.
Um,
and so one of,
uh,

122
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.590
one of the useful aspects of,

123
00:07:57.591 --> 00:08:01.060
of Anderson's a account is,

124
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.800
is yet again to,
uh,

125
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:08.140
looking back at the construction of nationalism,
uh,

126
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.860
to see that,

127
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:15.250
that here we have that old story that it states and large scale economic change

128
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:21.680
that are the two driving forces,
uh,

129
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:26.360
in the construction of national identities.
Now I've gone on,
you know,

130
00:08:26.361 --> 00:08:30.370
at least in two lectures and part of another one talking about British a

131
00:08:30.371 --> 00:08:31.490
national identity.

132
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:36.470
And I'm certainly not going to go through that again except to say that,
uh,

133
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:40.040
that it was for cautiously early the sense of being British.
Uh,

134
00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:45.041
and I also argued along the line that that we can now at least for elites say

135
00:08:45.231 --> 00:08:49.760
that French national identity began to be a constructed,
uh,
in,

136
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.260
at least by the middle of,
of the 18th century.
But if,

137
00:08:54.261 --> 00:08:57.810
when you think of the real hot spots,

138
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.950
the real trouble spots of,
um,
of,

139
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:05.880
of the 20th century,
uh,
when you think of the origins of World War One,

140
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:09.280
which we will be doing,
thinking out loud together,
uh,
it,

141
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.980
over the next couple of weeks,
uh,
we will be considering,
uh,

142
00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:15.180
eastern Europe,

143
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.530
central Europe and the Balkans.

144
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:21.390
And what's important to understand,

145
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:26.391
and here this is a reasonably decent transition from the initial discussion of

146
00:09:26.431 --> 00:09:29.520
this anthropologist excellent book,
uh,

147
00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:32.640
is that in most of those places,

148
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:37.740
there was no sense of national identity of being Slovene,

149
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.730
of being check,
of being Croat,
uh,
uh,

150
00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:46.380
of being Bulgarian,
uh,
of being Ukrainian or Ruthenian.

151
00:09:46.381 --> 00:09:48.720
The two two are essentially the same,
uh,

152
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:52.350
until quite late in the 19th century.

153
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:56.310
And so part of what's going on in Europe,
uh,

154
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.400
between let's say 1880s and 1914 is this an incredible advancement in quotes,

155
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.090
uh,
if you want to call it that,
uh,

156
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.970
in thinking with the emergence of,

157
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.650
of a national identity of ethnic national identity,

158
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.370
uh,

159
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:22.370
in that identities competing and demanding their own states in that part of the

160
00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:29.460
world.
And of course,
when,
uh,
in late June,
1914,

161
00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:34.410
a 16 year old,
heavily armed guy,
Serb nationalist,

162
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:39.210
uh,
I went to put my feet in the,
in the,
which my feet still exist,

163
00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:43.200
but the places that the steps in Syria,
they will no longer exist because of,

164
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.580
of a,
of all the bombing and the place where Princip shot arts.

165
00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.840
Fran for a Francis Ferdinand.
Uh,

166
00:10:49.841 --> 00:10:54.660
the assassination that led to,
uh,
because of this,
the,
the sort of,
uh,

167
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.370
entangling alliances,
a diplomatic alliances that led to World War One,

168
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.130
um,
uh,
that,

169
00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:05.650
that he was someone who practically could not have existed,
uh,

170
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.600
in the middle of the 19th century,
even though among Serb elites there,

171
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:14.130
there was,
uh,
there was a national,
uh,
a sense,

172
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:18.470
and I'm going to give you some examples taking out of,
taken from Anderson,
uh,

173
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.830
of even,
uh,

174
00:11:19.831 --> 00:11:24.640
the publication and the very first dictionaries in languages,
uh,

175
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:28.760
that we now in our f are quite common for us to,
to,
uh,

176
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.330
to identify with national states,
with ethnic national states.

177
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:35.490
Uh,
but in fact that the,
the,

178
00:11:35.491 --> 00:11:38.490
some of these states as some of these languages did not even have their own

179
00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:42.150
written dictionaries until the middle of the 19th century.

180
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.410
And that's not so long ago.
So nationalism has to be constructed,
uh,
uh,

181
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:50.880
a sense of self identity has to be constructed.

182
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.450
And so that's Kinda what I want.
Uh,

183
00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:56.860
I talk about now,
let me say something.

184
00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.880
And if the beginning is that because of the French revolution and because of the

185
00:12:03.341 --> 00:12:04.540
development in,

186
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:09.541
in Europe and in other places of parliamentary regimes and democracies,

187
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.290
uh,
it's fairly common to think,
well,
um,

188
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.190
national selfconsciousness equals and desire for national states.

189
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:22.270
And you can't have that with,
uh,
with a monarchy.
Well,

190
00:12:22.271 --> 00:12:26.200
that's not really true at all.
I mean,
that's influenced,
for example,

191
00:12:26.201 --> 00:12:30.310
by the experience of the United States.
Now the United States,
the 13 colonies,

192
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:34.960
English was,
was overwhelmingly,
uh,
the language of the 13 colonies.

193
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.570
And they are rebelling,
uh,
at the,
you know,

194
00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:42.571
in 1776 in all of that against other English speaking people,

195
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:47.830
uh,
who happened to had a,
a monarchy.
And so no tannic,

196
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:52.640
no taxation without representation really became also a kind of an anti,

197
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:56.520
uh,
uh,
Marnika monarchists,
uh,
uh,
a sentiment.
Uh,

198
00:12:56.521 --> 00:12:58.440
if you think of the Spanish,
uh,

199
00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:03.070
or the rebellions in Latin America against Spain,
there to,

200
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.600
uh,
the rebellion,
though there were,
you know,
millions of people,
uh,

201
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.270
who have indigenous peoples who,
who,

202
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:14.890
who did not speak Spanish.
But basically it was a,
it was a rebellion of,
of,

203
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:18.880
of Spanish speakers against a monarch.
Uh,

204
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.420
that was Spanish speaking,
uh,
in the case of Spain.

205
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.070
But if you think about really extreme ethnic nationalism,
uh,

206
00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.990
at the end of the 19th century,

207
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:33.160
you think of two states who help kind of push the world to the catastrophe.

208
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.820
That was World War One.
Uh,
uh,
one has to,
to,
uh,

209
00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:41.410
point the finger at a both Russia,
uh,
and uh,
and Germany,

210
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:46.000
uh,
which had autocracies.
Uh,
and that the campaign,

211
00:13:46.001 --> 00:13:48.750
for example,
this is jumping ahead a little bit,
but just,

212
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:53.100
I'm providing you an overview of the campaign of,
of Russification,
uh,

213
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:56.810
that was undertaken by the Russians Czars uh,
uh,

214
00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:01.720
a brutal campaign against non Russian minorities,
uh,

215
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:06.750
was in part a response to rebellions within the Russian empire by polls,

216
00:14:06.941 --> 00:14:11.500
for example,
who rise up in 1831 and an 1863.

217
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:16.390
And our crushed like grapes,
uh,
at an 1863 Bismarck,

218
00:14:16.391 --> 00:14:20.620
the chancellor of Germany congratulates the czar for,
for stopping on,

219
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:25.760
on the Polish and surgeons.
But the campaign and Russia furcation,
uh,
um,

220
00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.960
uh,
uh,
was part of,

221
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.620
of the reinvention of Russian national identity.

222
00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:35.330
And I talk my talk about Peter the Great,
I talked about how he was,
you know,

223
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:39.550
so I'm selfish.
That's great.
Russian patriot,
well,
uh,
they,
the Russian,
uh,

224
00:14:39.551 --> 00:14:44.551
aggressive Russian nationalism pixus targets a rather systematically and

225
00:14:45.041 --> 00:14:48.040
campaigns of Russian Russification and the big pogrom,

226
00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:53.060
the massacre occurs of Jews in Adesa,
uh,
you know,
in Crimea,
uh,

227
00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:57.140
and in other places or cheered on by the Russian czar,
uh,
uh,

228
00:14:57.141 --> 00:15:00.440
by Nicholas the second who am,
I will talk about when I,
when I get to,
uh,

229
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.930
other Russian revolution who saw this is a healthy thing,
uh,

230
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:08.270
that the Jews are being beaten to death by real Russians.
Uh,

231
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:13.160
and this was part of,
of his,
uh,
his campaign of Russia furcation.
Uh,

232
00:15:13.161 --> 00:15:17.390
in the case of Germany,
you've got this sort of,
you know,
mad cap,
uh,
um,

233
00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.900
loser,
uh,
Bill Helm,
the second,
uh,
you know,

234
00:15:20.901 --> 00:15:24.290
cracking bottles of champagne or not a champagne,
but of reasoning,
as I said,

235
00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:28.850
over,
over,
over big,
speedy battleships,
powerful battleships and all of that.

236
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:33.770
And so nobody was more nationalist,
uh,
aggressive nationalists.
Then bill helm,

237
00:15:33.771 --> 00:15:34.341
the second,

238
00:15:34.341 --> 00:15:37.700
the Kaiser who kept saying whether disingenuously that he was the number one

239
00:15:37.701 --> 00:15:42.580
German,
uh,
and all of that.
So we can get rid of the idea that,
that,
that,
that,
uh,

240
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.740
uh,
that strong national identity,
uh,

241
00:15:45.741 --> 00:15:50.150
necessarily has a parliamentary,
uh,
outcome.
I mean,

242
00:15:50.151 --> 00:15:52.460
the case of Britain,
well,
we're not going to,
I've talked about written too much,

243
00:15:52.461 --> 00:15:55.530
but I,
the case of Britain is pretty interesting too,
but there you have a,

244
00:15:55.531 --> 00:15:57.770
a monarch without real power,

245
00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:02.780
but Victoria Rep represents in the imaginary of the British citizens,

246
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:04.970
uh,
what,
uh,
uh,
you know,

247
00:16:04.971 --> 00:16:09.320
the stability and the really the constitutional settlement of,

248
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:13.920
of the British empire.
But yet,
uh,
uh,
a couple of points,
you know,

249
00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:17.780
it need to be made is that that,
um,
language,
uh,

250
00:16:17.781 --> 00:16:22.440
is important in all of this.
And,
and,
uh,
um,
though not always,
I mean me,

251
00:16:22.441 --> 00:16:26.420
if I have time,
I'll give a Swiss example,
uh,
uh,
later on.
Uh,

252
00:16:26.421 --> 00:16:27.920
but basically,
uh,

253
00:16:27.921 --> 00:16:32.921
in the case of Russian and German nationalism and French nationalism and even

254
00:16:33.621 --> 00:16:38.450
Spanish nationalism,
uh,
because of the dominance of Castillo,
uh,
uh,

255
00:16:38.451 --> 00:16:43.250
one looks back to the time when national languages,
uh,
are,

256
00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.960
are,
which are already existed,

257
00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:50.020
are used and become identified with this self identity of national people.

258
00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:56.120
Now,
Latin was the language.
I mean,
Latin was the language of,
of,
uh,
um,
of,

259
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.420
of science,
of diplomacy,
of everything.
Uh,

260
00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.350
and it really part of it that what's intriguing about the,
uh,

261
00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:06.700
about the scientific revolution is that an important about it is that,
that,

262
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.420
that the vernacular languages begin to,

263
00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:13.610
to be used as a way of communicating a scientific discoveries.

264
00:17:13.611 --> 00:17:17.290
There's a little bit in that chapter that you read about that.
Um,
and,

265
00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:22.280
and certainly language is closely tied to national,

266
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.180
uh,
the national self identity.
Uh,
and of course,

267
00:17:26.181 --> 00:17:29.750
one of the ways when a nationalism is his,
uh,
uh,

268
00:17:29.751 --> 00:17:34.751
his most aggressive and most vulgar is when a very ordinary people whipped off

269
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:39.110
on by elites in some ways are urged on by elites.

270
00:17:39.111 --> 00:17:43.600
Begin identifying people who don't speak the same language is somehow,
uh,

271
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:47.750
as somehow not part of this imagined community.
You know,

272
00:17:47.751 --> 00:17:50.120
an obvious example would the,
uh,
you know,

273
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.910
all of the Hungarians who after the treaty of Versailles,
uh,

274
00:17:53.911 --> 00:17:58.840
in 1919 and the subsequent treaties,
a named after a pair of suburbs,
uh,

275
00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:03.510
are included in,
uh,
in Romania and are treated as,

276
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:07.230
you know,
as outsiders.
And,
and this is very important even in the origins of the,

277
00:18:07.231 --> 00:18:07.391
of,

278
00:18:07.391 --> 00:18:12.280
of the 1989 a revolution that brought down the dreadful to chest choose,

279
00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:17.150
uh,
dictators in,
uh,
uh,
in Romania.
But anyway,
you know,
the,

280
00:18:17.151 --> 00:18:21.760
the vernacular,
uh,
develops,
uh,
if you exclude,
you know,

281
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:26.250
the cases of Spain,
of Spanish,
Latin American,
rebelling against Spain and the,

282
00:18:26.251 --> 00:18:27.840
and the Americans rebelling against,

283
00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:32.050
against the British and the development of these,
these languages,
uh,

284
00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:35.130
and the use of the languages and their identity.
With this.

285
00:18:35.131 --> 00:18:39.270
Imagine community is obviously a very important,
uh,

286
00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.940
part of,
of this as well.

287
00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:46.290
And with the development of the concept of being a citizen.
And then,
you know,

288
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:47.460
this is why the friendship,

289
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:50.950
one of the many reasons the French revolution is so important,
uh,

290
00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.600
that you're no longer the subject of the king.
You're a situa.
Yeah.

291
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:59.180
Or if you're female,
you're a situa yen.
Nah.
Uh,
uh,
citizenship,
uh,

292
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:03.660
takes on this kind of linguistic,
uh,
uh,
aspect as well.

293
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.630
During the French Revolution,
uh,

294
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.400
there was a revolutionary priests called the Abbe Greg.
Wow.

295
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:11.700
I think I mentioned him in the book and,
and he thought that the,

296
00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:16.260
all of these regional languages should be a squished like grapes.

297
00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:19.440
I be guess somehow they stood in the way of,

298
00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:24.340
of a true French national identity.
Um,
you know,
the,

299
00:19:24.341 --> 00:19:29.010
the whole language.
I mean,
it's so terribly complicated because,
uh,
in the,

300
00:19:29.011 --> 00:19:33.630
in the case of Italy,
which is sort of a,
in some ways a counterexample,
um,

301
00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:36.120
I think I said before,
but it's still,
it's true that,

302
00:19:36.121 --> 00:19:38.100
that at the time you were Italian unification,

303
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.160
only about four or 5% of the population of Italy,

304
00:19:41.161 --> 00:19:45.450
of the whole boot and Cecily spoke with is now considered to be Italian.

305
00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:50.940
Uh,
the case of Francis is it,
which I know more about is,
is equally fascinating.

306
00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.770
I,
because at the time of the French revolution,

307
00:19:52.771 --> 00:19:57.570
half the French population did not speak French.
There was a lot of bilingualism,

308
00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:02.240
uh,
but they did not speak French.
Uh,
and if you imagine a map of,

309
00:20:02.241 --> 00:20:04.710
of France,
and I think I went through this very quickly before,

310
00:20:04.711 --> 00:20:09.200
but if you imagine a map of France,
and if you start at the top,
uh,
they spoke,
uh,

311
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.130
uh,
uh,
near alone day or,
or,
or,
or Dutch,
uh,

312
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.580
in Dunkirk and places like that.
And if you move over to Alsace and,

313
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:21.360
and much of the hen they spoke,
uh,
a German dialect there,

314
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.900
and that would be a majority language until,
well after World War One,

315
00:20:24.901 --> 00:20:28.410
I mean that and that and how the French tried to get rid of the German,
uh,

316
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.580
is another story of sort of national aggression even in the context of Germany's

317
00:20:32.581 --> 00:20:34.260
defeat after war one.

318
00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:38.010
And then if you move further south as you go to [inaudible],
which was,

319
00:20:38.011 --> 00:20:38.940
don't write this down,
but it's,

320
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:42.780
I've always said it was next to France in 1860 people spoke essentially

321
00:20:42.781 --> 00:20:47.510
Piedmontese,
which is the language spoken in northern Italy,
uh,

322
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.210
in the state of the strongest date of Italy,
Piedmont,
Sardinia.

323
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.940
And then you go further down and they spoke what they spoke,
Provence,
Sal,

324
00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.850
Provence,
Sol as in,
you know,
Shonda fill hat and mine and mine only sauce and,

325
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.870
and uh,
and these,
these,
uh,
uh,
Provence,

326
00:21:03.871 --> 00:21:07.360
all poets sitting up at a place called [inaudible] and freezing in the,

327
00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:11.440
and the winds of the muse trial,
uh,
and reading each other,
uh,

328
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.130
Provence hell poetry.
Uh,

329
00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.300
then you go to a loading dock and they spoke a [inaudible],

330
00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.420
which is a language of,
of,
of,
of,
of upcoming,
that's a southern French,
uh,

331
00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.920
language.
Uh,
uh,
it's a written language.
Uh,

332
00:21:23.921 --> 00:21:27.600
you go to Catalonia and they spoke caterpillar,
no surprise there.
I,

333
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.910
you go into the boss' country and they spoke boss,

334
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:33.400
which is only a remotely connected to,

335
00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.900
to finish and Magyar that has,
those are the three hardest languages in Europe.

336
00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:40.200
I mean,
how they got there.
That's another whole story.
You know,

337
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:44.740
we don't really know if you go north.
They spoke Gus,
uh,
if you go into Brittany,

338
00:21:44.741 --> 00:21:48.540
they spoke a Brett tone,
which has nothing to do with French at all of what tall.

339
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:53.220
Uh,
and then,
but even in places that didn't have languages,
uh,

340
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:57.250
there were Patois and a,
Patois is a sort of denigrating term.

341
00:21:57.251 --> 00:22:00.130
This is what they speak,
Patois and others,
they don't speak really French,

342
00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:04.090
but in central France,
or they spoke one pot,
Twi and the Limu Zam,

343
00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:07.010
they spoke another Patois that was related to that one.
Uh,

344
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.550
even in the lower valley,
people spoke Patois.

345
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:13.720
So this did not condemn them to eternal backwardness.
Uh,

346
00:22:13.721 --> 00:22:15.500
and one might say that that in,

347
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:20.320
in the construction of French national identity that,
um,
you know,

348
00:22:20.321 --> 00:22:24.550
there was an argument a long time ago by my late friend Eugen Weber that said

349
00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:29.551
that all French national identity had to be constructed between 1880 and 1910

350
00:22:29.561 --> 00:22:34.120
because of railroads,
military conscription and education,

351
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.330
railroads,
military conscription and education.

352
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:41.370
It's easy to see how that would work.
Uh,
but in fact,
I mean,
he missed a,

353
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.700
one of the complexity of this,
uh,
a glorious country is that you,
you know,

354
00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.270
that lots of Breton soldiers,
uh,

355
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:52.120
didn't learn a French until they were in the trenches if they're lucky enough to

356
00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:56.890
survive and world war one.
And they still spoke breath tall in,
uh,
in,
in the 18,

357
00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.040
uh,
uh,
in the,
in the 1920s,
in 1930s.

358
00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:04.240
And they're still old ladies in,
in Brittany that still speak,
but tall.

359
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:09.160
And their command of French is,
is,
is,
uh,
a bit,
uh,
uh,
problematic or in Corsica.

360
00:23:09.161 --> 00:23:11.110
They're still have many people to speak course Corsicans.

361
00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:16.150
They may or may not feel like they're French.
Uh,
uh,
so it,
it's in bilingualism.

362
00:23:16.151 --> 00:23:18.660
I mean,
I'll just as a little aside in the village where,
you know,

363
00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:22.610
I spent half my life actually in the last,
almost in the last,
uh,
uh,

364
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:24.550
25 years or so.
Uh,

365
00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:29.410
people spoke Patois and not French through the 1930s.

366
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:34.150
Uh,
and then that really sort of disappeared.
And now older friends of ours,
uh,

367
00:23:34.151 --> 00:23:38.630
understand Patois,
but they don't speak it.
And I had something from a book for a,

368
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.690
I did and I needed someone,

369
00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:45.410
I needed someone to look at to make sure that what had written in Patois was

370
00:23:45.411 --> 00:23:48.920
correct.
Not that I wrote it,
but,
or I took from something and he and my friend,

371
00:23:48.921 --> 00:23:53.660
my bull partner,
Lou,
he,
he,
his parents spoke that as their main language,

372
00:23:53.661 --> 00:23:55.670
but he,
he couldn't correct it.
He cause he,

373
00:23:55.671 --> 00:24:00.170
it's just those languages are disappearing.
It,
uh,
but,
uh,
the,
the,
the,

374
00:24:00.171 --> 00:24:02.500
the point of all this is,
is that,
uh,

375
00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.000
now the more we know about national self identity,

376
00:24:05.001 --> 00:24:07.980
it's possible to have more than one identity.
Uh,

377
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:11.630
and it's also just a leap of faith to say,
oh,
well,
so and so who are you?

378
00:24:11.631 --> 00:24:14.810
You ask who they are and that they're going to say,
well,
I'm German,

379
00:24:14.811 --> 00:24:16.670
or I'm friends.
It's going to be the first thing that they're going to say.

380
00:24:16.671 --> 00:24:20.060
They may say,
I'm from this village where I'm from,
this family where I'm from,

381
00:24:20.061 --> 00:24:24.830
this region,
uh,
or I'm Catholic or Protestant or Jewish or,
or,
or Muslim,
uh,

382
00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:29.060
some,
uh,
response like that.
But yet when we think of these,

383
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.440
of nationalism,

384
00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:35.530
we think of these languages as being motors for elites first and then ordinary

385
00:24:38.391 --> 00:24:43.391
people to demand states that the borders of states be drawn in a way that

386
00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:47.600
reflects their ethnicity.

387
00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:52.410
And after World War One and the treaty of Versailles,
you know,

388
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:56.390
you'd gone to war over the whole damn question of nationalism.
You know,

389
00:24:56.391 --> 00:25:00.830
all these millions of people get killed,
dying and terrible ways,
you know,

390
00:25:00.831 --> 00:25:03.350
gas and,
and everything else.

391
00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:07.640
A flame throwers and machine guns and all this stuff that we'll,
we'll,

392
00:25:07.641 --> 00:25:09.920
we'll talk about.
And so they say,
well,
Geez,
you know,

393
00:25:09.921 --> 00:25:13.190
if we draw the lines around these peoples and give everybody a state,

394
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:16.190
that'll be cool.
And then we won't have wars anymore.

395
00:25:16.191 --> 00:25:19.470
So they get all these big maps and these map makers and they tried to draw these

396
00:25:19.471 --> 00:25:23.180
state boundaries of the after the collapse of the four empires.

397
00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:26.770
And it doesn't work.
You can't do it.
And then you've got winners and losers.

398
00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:31.350
And so if you get to punish the losers like hungry,
then you leave Hungary,

399
00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.630
this sort of small country,
uh,

400
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:37.670
with much of its population living on the other side of borders.

401
00:25:37.671 --> 00:25:40.970
And either imagining that that should still be part of Hungary or wanting

402
00:25:40.971 --> 00:25:44.510
themselves to live back in Hungary where there'd be nothing for them at all.

403
00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:48.140
But yet the period we're talking about and the period that I began with,

404
00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:52.130
you've got these kind of,
this mobilization of elite saying,

405
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:56.070
holy cow,
we need our own state.
And Remember Elian,

406
00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:00.800
I already gave you a lecture to go all these checks sitting in 1848 in a room

407
00:26:00.801 --> 00:26:05.090
like this and not quite as nice.
And they say,
Jesus,
if the ceiling falls in,

408
00:26:05.091 --> 00:26:08.210
that's the end of the Czech national movement.
Uh,
but,

409
00:26:08.211 --> 00:26:12.950
but between 1848,
the springtime of the peoples in 1914,

410
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:16.070
you have millions of people who,

411
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:21.040
a couple of decades before that had absolutely no sense of being Slovene or,

412
00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:25.340
or very little sense of being Slovene or Slovak or,
uh,
you know,

413
00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:30.050
Crider or whatever,
who are suddenly,
you know,
making national demands and,

414
00:26:30.051 --> 00:26:34.940
and,
and,
and wanting to have a separate state within the context,

415
00:26:34.941 --> 00:26:38.180
for example,
of,
or to be independent from the WHO Garren Empire.

416
00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:41.640
And one of those people was the 16 year old boy,
uh,
uh,

417
00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.490
Princip who blows the brains out of Franz Joseph out of,
uh,

418
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:49.350
out of Franz Ferdinand and his wife.
I,
when this car backs up the,

419
00:26:49.351 --> 00:26:51.240
the wrong street in Sarajevo,

420
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:53.850
though there were some of his friends were out there trying to get them to.

421
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.970
So that's just a way of kind of thinking,
uh,
thinking,
uh,
about,
uh,

422
00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:03.950
about that,
that stuff now.
Um,
okay.

423
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:08.700
Um,
let me give you a couple of examples here.
I wrote down,

424
00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:13.650
um,
Ukraine,
Ukraine is a huge country,
huge,
uh,

425
00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:18.750
important country a and test a relationship with Russia now because of,
of,

426
00:27:18.751 --> 00:27:23.070
uh,
having got Crimea and Russia,
uh,
wants to do,

427
00:27:23.071 --> 00:27:24.390
to have Crimea and,

428
00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:27.840
and all of this highly contested relationship because of the number of Russians,

429
00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:32.660
uh,
who live in,
in Ukraine and,
and all of that.
And for Ukrainians,
uh,

430
00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:36.870
the sense that Ukraine always exists,
existed,
uh,
is always taken as a given.

431
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:41.550
The first Ukrainian grammar book,
and this is not dissing Ukrainians or anybody,

432
00:27:41.551 --> 00:27:42.211
but I'm just staying there.

433
00:27:42.211 --> 00:27:47.040
The reality is that the first Ukrainian grammar book with published,
not in 1311,

434
00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:50.490
uh,
or in 1511,
uh,
but in 18,

435
00:27:50.491 --> 00:27:52.680
19 is the very first one,

436
00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.620
the first check German dictionary.
You know,

437
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.600
if you're going to have a national identity,

438
00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:02.370
you got to have a dictionary so you can translate things between German and

439
00:28:02.371 --> 00:28:05.550
Czech is published.
Uh,
it's a long publication process.

440
00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:10.320
1935 to 1939 a to z,

441
00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:14.190
the first check national organization and the one I just described,
uh,

442
00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:18.050
starts in 1846.
Now,
that's pretty recent.
Uh,

443
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.640
the first Norwegian grammar book,

444
00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:25.350
which is distinguished Norwegian as a separate language and a separate,

445
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.840
a separate identity from say,

446
00:28:27.841 --> 00:28:32.460
Swedish and Danish is not till 1848,

447
00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:37.230
uh,
grammar book.
And the first a dictionary that is separating,

448
00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.010
uh,

449
00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:43.010
making a distinction between Norwegian and Danish isn't until 1850.

450
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.990
And that's what I mean about,
uh,
you know,

451
00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:49.890
about the construction of national identity is that,
you know,
you have to have,

452
00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:53.040
uh,
you know,
that you have to have a sense that,

453
00:28:53.041 --> 00:28:57.990
that you are part of this imagine community.
Now,
let me,
having said that before,

454
00:28:57.991 --> 00:29:02.580
I talk about a counterexample yes,
yes,
yes.
Let me do this like that.
Why not?

455
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:04.790
Um,
let me,
um,

456
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:09.690
let me give you a couple examples that,
that I hope make the point.
And these are,

457
00:29:09.691 --> 00:29:13.740
I'm drawing from,
from uh,
uh,
from Snyder,
um,
that,

458
00:29:13.741 --> 00:29:16.890
let's look at why at the end of the 19th century,

459
00:29:16.891 --> 00:29:21.690
Lithuanian nationalism develops Lithuania,
Lithuania,

460
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:26.810
capitol,
Vilnius,
big tall basketball players like a sub.
Oh,
nice.
Uh,

461
00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:31.290
who played in the NBA.
Um,
you know,
that,

462
00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.800
why Lithuanian nationalism rapidly develops,

463
00:29:34.801 --> 00:29:36.870
but only at the end of the 19th century.

464
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:42.500
And Belorussian nationalism doesn't develop at all until way in,

465
00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:47.470
uh,
uh,
well it's even pushing it to say in the twenties and thirties.

466
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.700
Now there's this huge Byelorussia or was it,
you know,

467
00:29:49.701 --> 00:29:52.180
in polar and the various times I go to Poland,
there were,
uh,
I was there,

468
00:29:52.181 --> 00:29:54.820
there was a huge dinner with all these Belorussians,
uh,
who are,

469
00:29:54.821 --> 00:29:57.790
most of them were dissidents and are there to discuss the history of,

470
00:29:57.970 --> 00:29:59.710
of Belorussia,
but not none of them.

471
00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:02.680
What we're going to be claiming that bellow Russia and has had an identity.

472
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.710
He had a self identity,
uh,
before,
uh,
uh,

473
00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:10.270
of the 1930s but listen,
we existed,
uh,

474
00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:13.700
Lithuania was part of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth.
So,

475
00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:18.900
which exists basically until the last partition in Poland in 1795 when Pola and

476
00:30:19.391 --> 00:30:23.920
gets munched bouffy by,
you know,
by the great powers.

477
00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:27.880
Um,
but,
but so who do these people think they were?
Well,

478
00:30:27.881 --> 00:30:30.160
they think they're Polish.
Uh,

479
00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:35.250
they considered themselves Polish and Paul's already had a basis for

480
00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:40.090
nationalism.
They had a written language.
They have heroes,
Chopin,

481
00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.300
there's one,
Chopin didn't go to Paris by the waiter,
you know,

482
00:30:43.301 --> 00:30:46.750
as a refugee from a Russian repression and went there to further his musical

483
00:30:46.751 --> 00:30:50.470
career.
But anyway,
uh,
he wrote,
there were lots that had to do with oppression,

484
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:55.010
with a Polish,
uh,
uh,
national themes,
folklore,
uh,

485
00:30:55.011 --> 00:30:58.720
and all of that.
Um,
and so,
uh,

486
00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:04.930
uh,
there,
there were Duke's,
there had been dukes of Lithuania grand,

487
00:31:04.931 --> 00:31:07.360
Duke's,
uh,
but they never published.

488
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:11.290
They didn't accept Lithuanian a as a language.
Um,

489
00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:15.550
and if they wanted to get anywhere,
they tried to pass themselves off as polls.

490
00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:20.880
Pilsudski a name you'll come back to who destroyed the Polish republic as one

491
00:31:21.761 --> 00:31:26.680
after another of European states goes a authoritarian and the 1920s and thirties

492
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:30.670
peeled Zeus key,
who was the hero of the miracle,
the Vistula river.

493
00:31:30.671 --> 00:31:35.090
When the Polish army turns back the Red Army,
uh,
you know,
you know,

494
00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.960
at the end of World War One and just sort of amazing,
you know,

495
00:31:37.961 --> 00:31:42.670
moment pilled Zoosk he himself,
you know,
was the son considered himself?
Uh,

496
00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:47.130
uh,
uh,
considering selfless.
He was Lithuanian.
Uh,

497
00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:51.160
but he considered himself Polish.
He was absolutely a Lithuanian,

498
00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:56.290
but yet there was a Lithuanian language,
but it was not spoken by the elites.

499
00:31:56.710 --> 00:32:00.820
So who spoke the Lithuanian language?
It was spoken by the peasants.

500
00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.660
So at the end of the 19th century,
you suddenly got all these intellectuals,

501
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:09.750
these Lithuanian intellectuals and grand Duke's and priests and various people

502
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.180
saying,
wait a minute,
we are Lithuanians.

503
00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:18.480
And happily the Lithuanian peasantry has saved our language from the last

504
00:32:19.031 --> 00:32:24.031
Lithuanian Duke who spoke Lithuanian died before Columbus discovered America.

505
00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.660
Tim Snyder inform me.
So suddenly they say,
oh,
baby,

506
00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:31.120
these Lithuanian peasants,
instead of just being,

507
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.520
we won't treat them anymore as the scum of the earth.

508
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.640
They have preserved our language for us.

509
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:41.330
And suddenly you have poets writing and Lithuanian and it's no longer a disgrace

510
00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:45.830
to be seen,
uh,
as,
uh,
a Lithuanian.
Uh,
there was,
uh,

511
00:32:45.831 --> 00:32:50.600
one of these poets,
a guy called,
uh,
uh,
Rica,
uh,
uh,

512
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:52.820
who died in 1899.

513
00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:57.920
He recalled when he was in school as the Lithuanian kid is smart Lithuanian kid.

514
00:32:57.921 --> 00:32:58.161
He says,

515
00:32:58.161 --> 00:33:03.110
my self preservation instinct told me not to speak and Lithuanian and to make

516
00:33:03.111 --> 00:33:07.010
sure that no one noticed that my father wore a rough peasants coat and could

517
00:33:07.011 --> 00:33:11.360
only speak Lithuanian.
I did my best to speak spoke Polish,

518
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.690
even though I spoke at badly.
Polish it for is a terribly difficult language.

519
00:33:14.691 --> 00:33:17.770
There's all these sorts of squiggly things that,
that,
uh,
you know,
that you just,

520
00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:19.520
it doesn't,
things don't pronounce like it's supposed to,

521
00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.110
but are you saying there's supposed to be,

522
00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:23.750
and I don't do very well at the picking it Polish,
but,
um,

523
00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.230
when my father and other relatives visited me,
I stayed away from them.

524
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:30.560
And when I could see that fellow students or gentlemen were watching,

525
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:35.800
he was embarrassed to be basically Lithuanian and the son of a Lithuanian

526
00:33:35.961 --> 00:33:38.960
peasant.
I only spoke with them,
uh,

527
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:42.590
at ease when we were alone or outside.

528
00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.500
I saw myself as a pole and thus has a gentleman.

529
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:50.580
I had imbibed the Polish spirit,
but it's only,
you know,

530
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:51.590
by the end of the century,

531
00:33:51.591 --> 00:33:55.940
he sees himself as a Lithuanian and he is one of these people who is pushing

532
00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:00.710
Lithuanian nationalism.
And it is,
uh,
it is embraced.

533
00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:03.020
Now how does this physically happen?
I mean,

534
00:34:03.021 --> 00:34:06.930
how do you do you don't wake up and say,
oh,
well I was Polish yesterday and,
uh,

535
00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:10.880
uh,
as a subject of,
of the czar,
uh,
cause we're going to,

536
00:34:10.881 --> 00:34:15.080
Poland is divided between Prussia,
Austria,
Hungary,
and Russia.

537
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:18.380
But if you were in the Russian part of what they called Congress,
Poland,

538
00:34:18.381 --> 00:34:21.680
and suddenly today I'm Lithuanian.
How does that happen?
Well,

539
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:26.020
because Lithuania is next to Germany and this is also something we'll make you

540
00:34:26.021 --> 00:34:29.360
again,
think of what I said about the enlightenment is that lots of literature is

541
00:34:29.361 --> 00:34:31.490
smuggled in to,
uh,

542
00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:36.200
into Lithuania in Lithuanian.
And so therefore,

543
00:34:36.410 --> 00:34:37.640
uh,
uh,

544
00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:42.440
there's this wild or profusion of Lithuanian literature that comes into,

545
00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:47.300
uh,
I,
that comes into Lithuania,
uh,
which of course as you know,
was not,

546
00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:51.920
was not independent.
It's part of the Russian empire.
Um,
and,
and so,

547
00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.960
uh,
there was another reason too,

548
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:57.890
which is for the Russian imperial secret police,

549
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:59.840
the ones that they're really worried about,

550
00:34:59.841 --> 00:35:03.500
they're worried about the polls because the polls after all of it risen up in

551
00:35:03.501 --> 00:35:06.080
1831 and an 1863.

552
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:09.410
And so they're on the lookout for people that are there say,
hey,
I'm Polish.

553
00:35:09.411 --> 00:35:11.690
We want to Polish state,
and they don't pay much attention.

554
00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.790
They don't really care about these Lithuanians,
uh,

555
00:35:13.791 --> 00:35:16.880
who are discovering their own self identity.

556
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:21.380
We're constructing their self identity.
Now why does it even happen in Belarus?

557
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:24.680
I don't have time to tell you very much about this,
but the main thing is,

558
00:35:24.681 --> 00:35:28.670
is that a bell or Bruce is a long way from anywhere,
uh,

559
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:33.300
at the time or there isn't any kind of elite in Byelorussia,
uh,

560
00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.530
that embraces Belorussian anything.
Uh,

561
00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:41.590
and so the language is not seen part of a national self identity that basically,

562
00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:42.480
uh,

563
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:47.480
does not exist and would not exist until at least after World War One.

564
00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:52.650
Uh,
and now,
you know,
Lithuanians,
we'll look back on their country as,

565
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:56.700
as if Lithuania had always had this sort of self identity,
but,
but,
you know,

566
00:35:56.910 --> 00:36:00.060
it was part of the,
if part of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth and,

567
00:36:00.061 --> 00:36:05.061
and a booth that was more basically a Polish operation than it was a territorial

568
00:36:05.491 --> 00:36:10.180
thing,
more than any kind of,
of,
of construction of,
of,
of,

569
00:36:10.181 --> 00:36:14.510
of two,
two people's participating in this.
Um,

570
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:18.600
this thing.
Furthermore,
um,
you know,
Belorussians Co we're,

571
00:36:18.601 --> 00:36:21.620
we're not allowed to publish in,
um,
in,
in,

572
00:36:21.621 --> 00:36:26.621
in Belorussian and were Lithuanian priests began giving sermons and Lithuanian,

573
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:30.360
and you've got all this sort of,
uh,
uh,
written material coming in,

574
00:36:30.361 --> 00:36:34.530
in the vernacular that nobody read Belorussian in church.

575
00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:39.480
There were no priests too to say that this is,
that this is our language.

576
00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:40.260
Um,

577
00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:45.260
and the Byelorussians who were literate could read Polish or Russian or both.

578
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:50.310
Uh,
but,
uh,
in,
in many cases,

579
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:54.690
not what would become Belorussian,
uh,
at all.

580
00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:56.700
And so by the end of the 19th century,

581
00:36:56.701 --> 00:37:00.720
when you've got these other people claim insisting that were Slovenes and where

582
00:37:00.721 --> 00:37:04.620
this and that,
uh,
Belorussians speakers called himself Russian,

583
00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:08.850
if they were a orthodox,
they call themselves,
that is orthodox religion.

584
00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.790
They call themself Polish if they were Roman Catholic.

585
00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:13.770
And if they were simply looking out for themselves,

586
00:37:13.771 --> 00:37:16.920
they just called themselves local.
They said,
we are part of,

587
00:37:16.921 --> 00:37:19.530
we live in the Russian empire and that's who we are.

588
00:37:19.531 --> 00:37:23.100
There was no sense of being Belorussian.
So there are different outcomes in,

589
00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.370
in uh,
all of this stuff now.
Um,

590
00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:30.660
having said that,
yeah,
yeah.
This is what I'm going to get there.

591
00:37:30.661 --> 00:37:34.530
We're going to get there.
Let me give you another,
uh,
uh,
example.
I want to,

592
00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.830
I want to find this date.
Um,

593
00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.860
that'll make you at least re sync,

594
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:45.190
realize that you can have a national identity and have more than one,

595
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:48.120
uh,
one language.
It's very complex.

596
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:51.600
I guess the most interesting case now would be Belgium,

597
00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:54.510
which I don't have a lot of time to talk about.
But in Belgium,

598
00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:59.050
I have a friend who,
um,
who works in the,
in the Belgian,
uh,
uh,

599
00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:03.810
Ministry of Culture,
uh,
in Brussels in about seven years ago,

600
00:38:03.811 --> 00:38:06.330
I asked him,
I said,
do you think you think Belgium will,

601
00:38:06.331 --> 00:38:09.390
it will exist in 10 years?
And he said,
I hope not.

602
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:12.600
This guy works for the Belgian Ministry of Culture.

603
00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:17.300
And this reflects the sharp antagonism between,
uh,

604
00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.440
between the Flemish,
uh,

605
00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:24.330
who basically live in the north and east,
but above all the northern parts of,

606
00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:25.530
uh,
of,

607
00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:30.180
of Belgium and who are more prosperous and who are more numerous about say,

608
00:38:30.181 --> 00:38:35.181
55% of the population and their tensions with the walloons that the French

609
00:38:35.561 --> 00:38:40.390
speakers,
you know,
the ash and,
and [inaudible] and all those places.
Uh,

610
00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:45.280
and then,
uh,
and then also in Brussels,
which is technically part of,
uh,
uh,
of,
of,

611
00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:48.490
uh,
uh,
uh,
part of the Flemish zone,

612
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.760
but because of the bureaucracy and because Belgium,

613
00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:56.200
Brussels is the most important city has become this sort of third place,

614
00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.850
hotly contested by the Flemish and real serious,
uh,
it attentions there.

615
00:39:00.851 --> 00:39:05.560
If you ask in French,
you know,
what time the train is to,
uh,
uh,
to,
uh,

616
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:09.430
bluish,
uh,
you know,
they,
they're not going to reply and they know perfectly well,

617
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:13.330
Eh,
they just simply won't reply and pretend that you did not,
not all of them,

618
00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.510
but there a serious tensions where component also by the fact that there tends

619
00:39:16.511 --> 00:39:21.340
to be,
not everybody,
but the,
the far right is really,
uh,
is really,

620
00:39:21.341 --> 00:39:25.290
really,
uh,
tied to Flemish self identity.
Uh,

621
00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.030
and the walloons that is the French,
uh,

622
00:39:28.031 --> 00:39:31.120
many of whom want to be attached to as French speakers want to be attached to

623
00:39:31.121 --> 00:39:34.510
France,
uh,
see their lives.
It's very different also that,
that the,

624
00:39:34.511 --> 00:39:38.020
that the Walloon part of Belgium is basically the rust belt.
Uh,

625
00:39:38.021 --> 00:39:42.910
and that the Flemish part is very,
very,
uh,
a prosperous in comparison,

626
00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.800
but yet Belgium,

627
00:39:44.801 --> 00:39:49.040
which didn't exist to 1831 legally didn't exist anyway.
They,

628
00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:53.590
the revolution in 1830 and 31,
it's still there by the way.

629
00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:58.540
There's also 5%,
uh,
tacked on after Versailles around a town called,
you've been,

630
00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:01.410
who speak German.
Uh,
but anyway,
there we go.
Uh,

631
00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:04.900
but Belgium is still there and as possible,
when I say when I'm in Belgium,

632
00:40:04.901 --> 00:40:06.140
which I am frequently,
I think that,

633
00:40:06.141 --> 00:40:09.610
I think now this is really Europe because of the complexity of it.

634
00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:14.500
And so you can have a national identity without having,
you know,

635
00:40:14.501 --> 00:40:18.490
a single dominant language if the two sides are tolerant.
Well,

636
00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:22.600
let me give you another quick example and then we got to rock and roll on to the

637
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:25.020
age of empires.
He wouldn't have a shortcut now,

638
00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:29.230
not Austria-hungary I got to time.
So,
so a age empire.
But what about Switzerland?

639
00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:32.600
Here you've got Switzerland.
What does it,
I,
if I remember correct this correctly,

640
00:40:32.601 --> 00:40:37.270
the statistics,
I think the French population speaking French population is 22%.

641
00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:42.250
Um,
German speaking or Swiss Deutsch,
uh,
uh,

642
00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:45.490
speaking population is about,
oh,

643
00:40:45.491 --> 00:40:49.250
maybe 71% or something like that.
Uh,
you've walked,

644
00:40:49.251 --> 00:40:52.840
you've got a Italian speaking population of about 5%,

645
00:40:52.841 --> 00:40:54.640
and you also have another language called Roman Nash,

646
00:40:54.641 --> 00:40:58.600
which has spoken only by a few hundred thousand people.
And so that's,

647
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:59.530
that's a one,
two,

648
00:40:59.531 --> 00:41:03.670
three languages already plus English because of the international role of Geneva

649
00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:06.280
is the fourth major language,
uh,

650
00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:09.880
fourth recognized language in Switzerland.
But,
you know,

651
00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:13.540
Switzerland or if you think of Switzerland now is so prosperous and then it was

652
00:41:13.541 --> 00:41:17.620
full of chocolate and full banks and full of watches and,
and Eh,
and,

653
00:41:17.621 --> 00:41:20.310
and all of that.
And you think everybody yodeling in cows,
you know,

654
00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:25.360
running around and everybody's very happy in eating perch on a lakes.
Uh,
but,

655
00:41:25.361 --> 00:41:29.170
but you know,
so,
but the Swiss have to create this sort of sense that,

656
00:41:29.171 --> 00:41:33.740
that they have always been a nation,
but of course they haven't.
And well,

657
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:37.850
Switzerland,
the decentralized federalist nature of,

658
00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:42.930
of Switzerland was always there too during the reformation to say somebody was

659
00:41:43.161 --> 00:41:48.161
turning Swiss meant that they were rejecting the demands of their lords there.

660
00:41:48.771 --> 00:41:53.771
Lords and rejecting the religion imposed by their lords and turning to

661
00:41:53.871 --> 00:41:56.690
Protestantism if they were in a Catholic area or to Catholicism,

662
00:41:56.691 --> 00:42:00.110
if they were on a process in the area.
Uh,
and,
and the Swiss were,

663
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:05.060
were big time mercenaries,
uh,
and,
and,
and,
and big time farmers.

664
00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:10.520
But Switzerland,
uh,
flat his last war and it,
you know,
early in the,

665
00:42:10.521 --> 00:42:13.380
in the 19th century has been neutral.
Uh,

666
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:16.220
and it's very complicated story what happened in Switzerland during the war.
Two.

667
00:42:16.221 --> 00:42:18.690
It's very tragic.
It's Switzerland.
The Swiss did not,
you know,

668
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:22.200
they turn so many Jews back at the frontier and send them back to it,

669
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:26.390
to the Germany and the laundering Nazi money and all that.
And,
and,
uh,
um,

670
00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:29.640
you know,
I'm not dumping on,
on the Swiss,
but it's a complicated story,
uh,

671
00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:33.200
in the case of,
uh,
of their neutrality.
But,
um,

672
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:38.470
so they decided in 1891 on the 600 to anniversary of what,

673
00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.300
of the Swiss,
um,

674
00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:46.360
a confederation that Switzerland began in 1291 that a bunch of people got

675
00:42:47.691 --> 00:42:51.290
together with between all the cows and eating chocolate and,
and,

676
00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:55.340
and all that stuff.
Um,
and that they announced that they were Switzerland.

677
00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:56.690
And so,

678
00:42:56.690 --> 00:43:00.170
so here's again what I mean that what Anderson means about this or imagine

679
00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:05.300
community that you're inventing a kind of date that you said,
well,
we've,

680
00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:08.240
we've been like that since then and that's all there is to it.

681
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:13.100
But if you've got all these different languages and the languages are not as far

682
00:43:13.101 --> 00:43:15.050
apart as French and Dutch,
when in a way they are,

683
00:43:15.051 --> 00:43:17.500
because Dutch is really where the Dutch would not see it that way,

684
00:43:17.501 --> 00:43:19.550
but is it a German dialect?
But nonetheless,

685
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:24.020
the Swiss are a lot better at learning each other's language.
Then,
uh,
uh,

686
00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:27.200
the French speakers,
certainly our learning,
learning Dutch,

687
00:43:27.201 --> 00:43:29.540
which they view as impossible and don't like the key.

688
00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:31.790
They don't like to have their kids having to learn it in school and all that.

689
00:43:31.791 --> 00:43:36.200
It's terribly complicated,
but so they imagine this community.
Uh,

690
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:37.190
but it exists.
I mean,

691
00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:40.970
especially the exist people have a sense of being Swiss despite these different

692
00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:44.180
languages.
Uh,
Eh,
um,

693
00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:47.570
they're not the disparities economic disparities that are there are between

694
00:43:47.571 --> 00:43:49.390
urban and rural life,
but nothing like that.

695
00:43:49.391 --> 00:43:54.380
The disparity between the Flemish parts of,
uh,
of,
uh,
Belgium,
Belgium,
and,

696
00:43:54.381 --> 00:43:58.220
and the French parts of Belgium.
If you exclude Roussel Brussels,

697
00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:02.530
you know that now,
but let me end in the last,
um,

698
00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:05.810
five minutes and seven seconds.
That is a,
a lot of,
to me,

699
00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:08.930
let me end with a counterexample,
which you can read about.

700
00:44:08.931 --> 00:44:10.640
And I said at the beginning,
uh,

701
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:14.090
you inspired by the sheer horror of the Balkans and tell me you aren't old

702
00:44:14.091 --> 00:44:18.320
enough to remember,
you know,
of certainly not my God.
I am,
uh,
you know,

703
00:44:18.321 --> 00:44:23.210
all of this stuff that happened in the 90s,
but you are,
uh,
the late nineties.

704
00:44:23.211 --> 00:44:25.940
You can probably remember all the massacres and stuff like that.

705
00:44:25.941 --> 00:44:28.730
And I said at the very beginning of the hour or the beginning of the 50 minutes,

706
00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:33.290
that people now tend to look longingly back and they say,
Geez,
you know,
uh Huh.

707
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:36.240
Oh,
the Austrian gear and empire at sure lasted a long time.

708
00:44:36.241 --> 00:44:39.990
He had 15 major nationalities.
It was kind of a balancing act.

709
00:44:39.991 --> 00:44:44.991
You've got becomes the dual monarchy in 1867 where the Hungarians have more or

710
00:44:45.691 --> 00:44:48.800
less,
uh,
uh,
equal rights.
The two to,
uh,

711
00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:52.920
you've got Australia and you've got a hungry,
but you got another 13 people's,

712
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:56.250
at least 13 peoples living within the empire.

713
00:44:56.251 --> 00:44:59.910
You've got the Croats who have their own nobility and they're kind of given

714
00:44:59.911 --> 00:45:02.970
favored status so that they can,
uh,
you know,

715
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:05.460
so this whole thing is sort of balancing like that,

716
00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:10.050
but how does the place stay together?
How does Austria,
Hungary stay,
uh,

717
00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:13.980
stay together?
I end and that one of those chapters,
that chapter with the,
uh,

718
00:45:13.981 --> 00:45:16.320
this very famous scene from,
from uh,
uh,

719
00:45:16.321 --> 00:45:19.920
from the parliament in Vienna where you've got these different ethnic groups

720
00:45:19.921 --> 00:45:23.760
playing drums and singing songs and trying to disrupt the speeches by,
uh,

721
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.650
by people from the other nationalities.

722
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:28.920
And you've got all these problems with the South Slavs wanting,
uh,

723
00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:34.070
at least minimal representation has sort of this third state in quotes between

724
00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:37.560
along with Austria,
Hungary.
How does the thing stay together?

725
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:39.390
We'll basically in this way,

726
00:45:39.391 --> 00:45:42.510
I'm just telling you briefly about things that you can read about,

727
00:45:42.511 --> 00:45:46.310
but I just wanted to make some sense of it.
Um,
first of all,
uh,

728
00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:49.650
is that the empire,
the language of the empire is German.

729
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:54.720
And to get somewhere in the Austrian hearing empire,
uh,

730
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:56.930
you need to know German.
Uh,

731
00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:00.450
and so learning German becomes this kind of a social mobility.

732
00:46:00.451 --> 00:46:04.200
The way that learning French becomes for somebody from gas Gascony a form of

733
00:46:04.201 --> 00:46:05.190
social mobility.

734
00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:08.700
You can get a job in the bureaucracy if you're going to have a huge old,

735
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:12.240
humongous empire,
uh,
you know,
going all the gall,

736
00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:16.950
the weighted to the rugged terrain of Bosnia Herzegovina,
uh,

737
00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:17.911
you know,
you gotta have,

738
00:46:17.911 --> 00:46:21.750
you gotta have officials in their little hats since they're little desks who are

739
00:46:21.751 --> 00:46:25.170
going to be running all this stuff.
And you've got to have a,
have a language.

740
00:46:25.171 --> 00:46:29.340
And so the language of the empire is German.
And so,
uh,
this is not mean,

741
00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:31.580
mean that people feel that they're German.
I mean,
after all being,

742
00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:32.790
they're not German,
they're,
they're,

743
00:46:32.791 --> 00:46:35.250
they're German speakers within the Austrian Gary and empire.

744
00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:40.380
But it gives them in allegiance to this apparatus.
Secondly,

745
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:43.980
the middle class,
the middle class is German,
uh,
uh,

746
00:46:43.981 --> 00:46:47.520
largely German excepted Budapest where it's,
it's Hungarian,
but,

747
00:46:47.521 --> 00:46:50.400
but still many Germans live in Budapest as well.

748
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.710
And one of the things that I wish I had time to talk about,

749
00:46:52.711 --> 00:46:57.090
but you can't talk about everything,
is that what you've got in these cities,

750
00:46:57.091 --> 00:46:59.070
and I mentioned this just a reference the other day,

751
00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.680
cities of all of eastern Europe and central Europe,

752
00:47:01.681 --> 00:47:06.270
you have [inaudible] of the cities because all of the cities,

753
00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:09.210
whether you're talking about Budapest or you're talking about Warsaw or you
know,

754
00:47:09.211 --> 00:47:12.660
anywhere you're talking about have a,
or even Vilnius,
you have strong,

755
00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:17.520
large German populations,
uh,
and also large Jewish populations.

756
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:20.760
Um,
and in the course of the last decades of the 19th century,

757
00:47:20.761 --> 00:47:24.210
you have the sort of arrival of love of peasants,

758
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:28.410
a Estonian peasants into Italian of check peasants into Prague,

759
00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:33.430
of Hungarian peasants,
into Budapest,
of Lithuanian peasants,

760
00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:36.190
into Vilnius,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

761
00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:40.960
But you've still got in the Austrian Garren,
uh,
case,
uh,
you still have,

762
00:47:40.961 --> 00:47:41.920
even in Budapest,

763
00:47:41.921 --> 00:47:46.150
you still have a large middle class that is fundamentally a German and believes

764
00:47:46.151 --> 00:47:50.530
in the empire.
Um,
next you've got dynastic loyalty.
Ah,

765
00:47:50.531 --> 00:47:55.510
you've got this,
this,
this old dude,
Franz Joseph,
uh,
who,

766
00:47:55.590 --> 00:48:00.170
uh,
had,
who had been there since 1848.
You know,

767
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:04.660
he lives til 1916.
The same guy.
Uh,

768
00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:09.460
and that,
that makes Victoria's seemed once you had a short rain and people are,

769
00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:12.730
you know,
people have an allegiance to this dynasty.
I mean,

770
00:48:12.731 --> 00:48:15.490
they have per dynasty had been,
you know,

771
00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:20.610
hadn't been a dominant in the central Europe until there that can test the

772
00:48:20.681 --> 00:48:25.350
Prussians and lose out,
you know,
in the,
in the war of 1866.
Uh,

773
00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:29.860
so you've got this,
this Franz Joseph,
uh,
also you've got the church,

774
00:48:29.861 --> 00:48:33.670
you've got the Catholic church.
Now,
there are lots of Protestants.
I,
for example,

775
00:48:33.671 --> 00:48:38.500
in,
in,
uh,
um,
in,
in the Czech lands in Bohemia,

776
00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:42.880
whereas slow Slovakia is almost overwhelmingly Catholic in what would become

777
00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:47.850
check Czechoslovakia and then divorce in amicably and us in,
uh,

778
00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:52.070
1990,
93,
um,
and Co Croatia is,

779
00:48:52.071 --> 00:48:55.700
is overwhelmingly Catholic aggressively.
So,
um,

780
00:48:55.900 --> 00:49:00.310
and so despite the fact you have these huge Muslim enclaves in,
in,
in the old,

781
00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:02.980
what had been the,
the,
the,
the Ottoman Empire,

782
00:49:02.981 --> 00:49:07.180
you still have this church is a unifying force,
not for everybody.

783
00:49:07.181 --> 00:49:08.760
It's certainly not for the Jews,
uh,

784
00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:12.970
not for the Gypsies of who are the Roma who are very many there.
And,
and not,

785
00:49:12.971 --> 00:49:16.720
not for Protestants and not for Orthodox Serbs.
Uh,

786
00:49:16.721 --> 00:49:20.260
which is part of the tensions there as well cause they saw a Russia as being

787
00:49:20.261 --> 00:49:24.100
their protector.
Um,
you can read more about that,
but that,
that's another thing.

788
00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:27.140
And finally you've got the army.
The army is a form of,
of,

789
00:49:27.141 --> 00:49:29.440
of social promotion as well.
You know,

790
00:49:29.441 --> 00:49:33.880
the army doesn't have the bad reputation that the French army did for,
for,
uh,

791
00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:38.440
you know,
shooting down.
A young girl's protesting,
young women protesting in,

792
00:49:38.441 --> 00:49:39.910
in strikes.
Uh,

793
00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:43.510
it doesn't have the reputation that the brutal guard Savella did in,

794
00:49:43.770 --> 00:49:47.050
in Spain.
The army is seen.
It's seen as,
as,

795
00:49:47.051 --> 00:49:50.450
as a useful way of representing the empire.
Uh,

796
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:54.580
it has a good reputation and German,
the language German is,
is,

797
00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:58.990
is the language of command.
And so these soldiers,
uh,
are,

798
00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:02.480
and the soldiers are drawn from all of these nationalities.
Uh,

799
00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:06.820
they at least have that in common.
Uh,
and,
um,

800
00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:09.320
so most of them to,

801
00:50:09.321 --> 00:50:12.100
to conclude the most important question to ask about this empire,

802
00:50:12.101 --> 00:50:15.820
particularly in reference to what I've been saying about this whole hour is,

803
00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:18.430
is to not look at,
you know,
why it came apart,

804
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:24.270
but to look at how it held together so long and given the horrors perpetuated on

805
00:50:25.601 --> 00:50:29.270
Europe by nationalism,
uh,

806
00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:31.880
from then and even before,

807
00:50:31.881 --> 00:50:36.140
as during the French revolution to this very day sometimes.

808
00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:38.750
And I never thought I'd ever say this about me,
uh,

809
00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:41.860
looking nostalgically back to an empire.
Uh,

810
00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:46.640
but it is an interesting and at least food for thought.
So on that note,

811
00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:48.890
Bonepar t and to see you on Wednesday.
