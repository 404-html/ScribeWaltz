WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.050
Second announcement is that,
um,
the,
the movies,

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.110
the films I have done what I think is the way to do it and they will be

3
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:10.044
available.

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.950
I think the first one is available now and you can watch it in the privacy of

5
00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:18.540
your rooms in whatever college who are,
um,
uh,
and uh,

6
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:23.160
you are too.
Please see them.
Um,
paths of glory goes with,

7
00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:27.270
with next week.
And that's the first one.
And it's very short.
It's very good.

8
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:30.300
It's one of the first Kubrick films and it's about the mutinies.

9
00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:33.750
And I will talk about the mutinies,
uh,
uh,
next week.

10
00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:38.130
So please have seen the film by Monday.
Uh,
and then,
um,

11
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.030
what can you tell them in a,
in section how they do that?
I mean,
I,

12
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.720
I did it but I'm not sure how I did it.
Uh,
so they should be set up,

13
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.260
but it's a film you can,

14
00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:50.340
another thing you can do is you can go down to film studies,
uh,

15
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:53.430
in the Whitney manage center and you can check out the film and watch it there.

16
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.150
I think you can take it back also,
but you can watch it on your computer screens.

17
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.440
So,
um,
uh,
but,
but,
and those are the three.

18
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:02.670
And the first one is the first one.

19
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:05.370
And then the second one is the second one where I'm really awake today.

20
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.650
The second one is,
is a triumph of the will,

21
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.360
which will go with the fascism lecture and be sure to have seen it before.
Uh,

22
00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:16.320
and the last one is a while on phone,
uh,
Louis Malle film,
uh,

23
00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:20.580
which will be a subtitled in English.
Uh,
and I think,
yeah.

24
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.000
And,
um,
yeah,
it is.
And is that,
that goes with,
uh,

25
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.380
the,
the,
the second to the last lecture.
So,
uh,
make sure you see it.

26
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.760
You see these films and they're not,
none of them are long and they're all great,

27
00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:35.850
great,
great films.
So,
uh,
uh,
you know,
if you,

28
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:40.080
if you can buy into Kirk Douglas as a,
as a,
as a French soldier,
uh,

29
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.770
you have to suspend reality a little bit,
uh,
to do that.
Okay.

30
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.790
Any in any announcements,
things happening?
All right.
So today,
this lecture,

31
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.350
uh,

32
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.490
much of it just parallels the chapter because the origins there were one can be

33
00:01:53.491 --> 00:01:57.840
confusing.
Uh,
and I just want to make those perfectly clear,
uh,

34
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.970
uh,
so that,
that you know,
this stuff.
So say help you read the,
read the chapter.

35
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.863
Um,

36
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.180
and also we used to have you read goodbye to all that,
which is very long,

37
00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:13.080
but very good.
I Robert Graves and then we used the inevitable,

38
00:02:13.081 --> 00:02:17.940
I'm all quiet on the western front,
but we,
we,
we suppressed those.
And,
and so,

39
00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:21.660
uh,
it's even more important that you,
that you read the read the chapter.

40
00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:23.980
So let me,
uh,
get into that.
And I'm,

41
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.490
I'm not gonna write all the terms on the board that I,

42
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.030
cause there's so many and I sent them around.
So it's just,
uh,
it's hard to see.

43
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.650
Anyway,
so what I have up here is,
uh,

44
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.050
when I talk about birth rates is between the drilling,
God darn it,
uh,

45
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:41.970
in the background anyway,
live births 1908 13 per 1000.
But I'll,

46
00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:45.250
I'll go into that in a minute.
So let me,
uh,

47
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.860
let me start now.
So,

48
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.040
you know,
because World War One,
you know,
1914,

49
00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:58.050
so many people wanted war and they,
they,

50
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.490
they ran to the God the last and chanted up our about law.

51
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.590
I bear lie and drank a lots of champagne and then home button,

52
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.790
the huff in Berlin,
they,
they chanted a knock pop.

53
00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:12.730
He's not a,
he's a,

54
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.300
nobody knew that the war was going to last over four years and kill millions of

55
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:20.770
people and uh,
uh,
mark the end of,
um,
of,

56
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.210
of four empires and arguably help contribute to the,

57
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.610
to the end of the fifth.
That is the British empire.
Uh,

58
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.100
the impetus toward d colon colonization that comes out of world war one.
Uh,

59
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.420
you know,
nobody,

60
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.930
nobody knew what that there was that the war that was supposed to be over.
Um,

61
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.550
by December,
I wasn't going to be over by December.

62
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.530
And outside of a couple of journalists who had been following the Russell

63
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.540
Japanese war in Manchuria had seen kind of the evolution of trenches.

64
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.840
Nobody could,
nobody predicted that kind of war.

65
00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:59.140
And I'll talk about military strategy at the end today or at the,

66
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:03.760
at in the plans for the war or depending on time,
the timing,
uh,

67
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.450
the end of,
or the beginning of next of next hour.
But,

68
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:12.130
so this makes the origins of the war so much more important.

69
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.650
And there are certainly in terms of diplomatic history,

70
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:18.580
there's no other event in the history of the world that has been so poured over

71
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.710
than the diplomatic origins of World War One.
The famous entangling alliances,

72
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.180
the host of cards that collapses,
all of those very familiar,
uh,
uh,

73
00:04:28.181 --> 00:04:31.030
images.
Uh,
and after the war,
I,

74
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:34.460
I had this great uncle who fought in the war.
I mean,
great,
great uncle.

75
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.470
He was an old dude when I was a very little guy.
Um,
and he had,

76
00:04:38.471 --> 00:04:41.740
he'd been in France in 1917 and at the end of the war,

77
00:04:41.741 --> 00:04:44.320
I remember when I was little kid,
he gave me the,
you know,

78
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:48.080
the sort of printed out books showing that the Germans had started the war and

79
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.560
there was the official account of the origins of World War One.

80
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.290
And of course the fact that that the end of the war,

81
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.060
the war ends with German troops inside France,
uh,

82
00:04:58.061 --> 00:05:01.990
this has a huge,
huge impact on what happens because of two things.

83
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.940
Looking ahead.
One,

84
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.710
it became very easy for the German right to say we weren't defeated.

85
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.390
We were stabbed in the back by who?
By the Jews,
by the Communists,

86
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.890
by the Socialists.
And secondly,
because Germany was defeated,

87
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.870
they had to sign on the,
on the bottom line saying,
uh,
we started the war alone.

88
00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:26.500
We alone the famous war guilt clause,

89
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.720
war guilt clause.

90
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.890
Now the Germans didn't start the war alone and I'll leave it to you to decide

91
00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:36.910
whether their responsibility,
the famous blank check given to Austria,

92
00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:41.170
Hungary is more important than the roles of other states.

93
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.950
Uh,
uh,
Russia declaring mobilization,

94
00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:49.660
which was tantamount to an act of war for reasons we'll come to,
uh,
or France,

95
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.130
uh,
for that matter.

96
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.090
But that's why the origins of a world war one are so important.

97
00:05:55.091 --> 00:06:00.091
And the other reason is that clearly world war one unleashes the demons of the

98
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:04.640
20th century that the guy,
the kind of racist stuff,

99
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:09.620
the even somewhat genocidal stuff was out there in the public domain,

100
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.230
but world war one turns it loose.
And we talk about,

101
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:17.630
I hope,
convincingly the Europe of,
of extremes,

102
00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:22.100
which is a title of a wonderful book by Eric Hobsbawm.
Um,

103
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.040
and one extreme being being communism.
But the other extreme,

104
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:29.570
which was more print all which was more,
uh,
uh,
victorious,
more overwhelming,
uh,

105
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.580
in Europe was the rise of fascism.

106
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.620
And in particularly the rise of national socialism and,

107
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.240
and this stuff was out there,

108
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.000
but national socialism and the Nazis cannot be understanding.

109
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.080
I understood what that,
where we one.
So that's why this stuff on the origins,

110
00:06:45.081 --> 00:06:49.480
this diplomatic history is so important.
So that's why I'm paralleling what,
uh,

111
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.740
what you are reading now that people,

112
00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:59.741
if you ask people in the 1880s and 1890s who will fight in the next war,

113
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.030
many people in German,
most people in Germany,
uh,

114
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:08.300
and many people in France would say that it'll be the Germans fighting the

115
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:12.320
French because of Alsace.
Lauryn,
other people as we'll see,

116
00:07:12.321 --> 00:07:14.430
particularly in the 1890s,
will say,
no,
it's,

117
00:07:14.431 --> 00:07:18.500
it's the British and the French who are going to be fighting colonial rivalries.

118
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.450
[inaudible] showed up and,
and all that business.
But the one that,
you know,

119
00:07:22.451 --> 00:07:26.900
as I in what you're reading is I put it though the old hatred that,
that,
that,

120
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.070
that is cannot be put off stage.
Uh,
it,

121
00:07:31.071 --> 00:07:32.240
during the entire period,

122
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:37.270
even when French and British relations or at their nadir at their worst is that

123
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.390
between Germany,
United,

124
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:46.480
the empire proclaimed in the hall of mirrors at Versailles Chateaux devout side,

125
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.170
uh,
and France.
Because after all,

126
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.390
the French had to give the most second,
most industrialized region,

127
00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:01.400
one of the most prosperous regions that is Alsace and much of it then to
Germany.

128
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:06.100
And I'm going to end up with an incident that looked like war was possibly going

129
00:08:06.101 --> 00:08:07.640
to break out between Germany and France.

130
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.610
And that is the Zalburn Rza van incident.

131
00:08:10.611 --> 00:08:13.630
And talk a little bit about Al Sassal random stuff that is,
and then,
uh,

132
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.260
in the book later just to make it,

133
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.960
I make it clear and it is complicated because the French could never accept the

134
00:08:20.961 --> 00:08:25.670
fact that Alsace and much of Lohan was now German.
Now this is again,

135
00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:28.700
remember we talked about nationalism and constructed identity.

136
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.220
Most people in Alsace and in those parts of the hen that became part of the,

137
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.950
the second hike,
the second empire,
where do they speak?

138
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:41.900
They spoke German dialect.
They did not speak French more about that later.

139
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.380
There was bilingualism.
But that's interesting.
If you ask them,
you know,

140
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.390
what nationality are you,
are are you?
And they reply in German,
I am French.

141
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.120
You know,
if you were somebody doing a survey now,

142
00:08:53.121 --> 00:08:57.240
you'd be sort of shocked by that.
Uh,
but I mean,
these are complex,

143
00:08:57.241 --> 00:09:01.770
these identities.
So anyway,
um,
the rivalry between,

144
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.170
um,
between France and,
and,
and,

145
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.290
and Germany was already always there.

146
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.330
If you went to the [inaudible] called in Paris,
the statue of straws,

147
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:15.720
wool,
the tone of straws,
boy,
which,
which,
uh,
you know,

148
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:18.330
important European capital now,

149
00:09:18.331 --> 00:09:21.420
but I've been a of of the new Europe for better,
for worse,

150
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:26.310
was covered in morning cloth for much of the period because it,

151
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:30.190
it had been amputated.
They used this image often that,

152
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:35.130
that the right arm of,
of,
of,
of France had been,
had been amputated,

153
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:39.360
uh,
in the settlement after the Franco,
uh,
a German war.

154
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.050
So that rivalry is there and,

155
00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:48.180
and French military planners right to the whole period at the time of Boulogne

156
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:53.070
Jay who you can,
who,
uh,
what was one who built this reputation,

157
00:09:53.071 --> 00:09:56.730
you can read already have read about the General Asocial boot on Jay,
you know,

158
00:09:56.731 --> 00:09:59.910
he is Mr Revenge and,

159
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.640
and a military planners said when the war comes a,

160
00:10:02.641 --> 00:10:07.641
we will move into Alsace and take a Alsace and parts of Lorenn back and then we

161
00:10:08.731 --> 00:10:12.150
will move to Berlin.
Simple just like that until the very end.

162
00:10:12.151 --> 00:10:16.590
That's their military strategy attack.
They're going to attack and get back.

163
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.210
Alsace-Lorraine what the Germans planned to do has a lot to do with the way,

164
00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.400
the way,
the way the war starts.
And we will get there.

165
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:29.120
Now the second big rivalry in Europe,

166
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.520
and again,
think of the 28th of June,
1914,

167
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.760
Sarah Evil 16 year old,

168
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:40.820
heavily armed Gobbler oh princip is that between Russia and Austria,

169
00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:47.481
Hungary and their rivalry is over the south Slavs who are within the Austrian

170
00:10:49.411 --> 00:10:52.800
Guerin empire and the Serbs who are not,

171
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.340
but who provide a constant force for,
um,

172
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:02.850
a destabilization in the region.
Now,
as you know,

173
00:11:02.851 --> 00:11:04.530
since the time of Catherine the great,

174
00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:08.430
she set her eyes on [inaudible] on Istanbul,
Constantinople,
same.

175
00:11:08.431 --> 00:11:12.930
They're the same city,
uh,
on the straights,
on access to the Black Sea.

176
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.850
Uh,
that was always going to be this drive of Russia to,

177
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:22.940
uh,
to,
to,
to the straights.
And as you know,
later in a Turkey allies with,
uh,
uh,

178
00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:27.630
with Germany.
Um,
but the big rivalry,
uh,
is,
uh,

179
00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:30.000
is in terms of Russian influence,

180
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.270
the stabilizing influence seeing itself as the protector,

181
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:38.420
the mother of all of the Slavic peoples is a permanent force of destabilization

182
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.950
in the Austrian Hungarian Empire on ironically,

183
00:11:40.951 --> 00:11:45.951
the guy who gets off along with his wife I the arts to Francis Ferdinand and his

184
00:11:46.021 --> 00:11:50.450
wife,
he was one of the more,
more,
I mean,
he was a prejudiced,
uh,

185
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.800
uh,
figure,
uh,
in many ways,

186
00:11:53.801 --> 00:11:56.740
but he was considered a moderate because he somehow,

187
00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:01.940
he believed that the South Slavs should have kind of a third status along with a

188
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:06.790
Ed possibly,
uh,
along with Germany and externally with,

189
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.510
excuse me,

190
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:12.430
Austria and Hungary within sort of a tripe park,
Tate,

191
00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.900
uh,
uh,
empire.
Uh,
and he,
and of course,

192
00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:21.460
he gets gunned down and what comes next is the blank check where the Germans
say,

193
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:26.410
do what you want to settle this situation.
And the famous ultimatum to,

194
00:12:26.411 --> 00:12:28.870
uh,
uh,
to Serbia by Austria,

195
00:12:28.871 --> 00:12:33.871
Hungary and the Russian government stirs up Pan Slavic fervor in the Balkans

196
00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:41.110
that they work consistently to,
uh,
to do that.
Um,

197
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.700
you know,
there are religious ties,
the Orthodox religion,
uh,

198
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.230
there's ties of,
of Alphabet,
Cyrillic,
alphabet,
uh,
used in Serbia,

199
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.350
cerebral creations,
the same language but,
but spoken language.

200
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.470
So Serb friends and Croatian friends would,
would deny that in some ways,

201
00:12:56.471 --> 00:13:00.160
but basically it's the same spoken language,
but the Serbs use cyrillic alphabet,

202
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:04.990
uh,
which is what the Russians use.
Uh,
and the Croats,
uh,

203
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:09.550
who are Catholic,
uh,
use,
you know,
the alphabet use didn't,
uh,
in,

204
00:13:09.551 --> 00:13:13.120
in western Europe.
So,
um,

205
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.790
the European alliance system,

206
00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:20.820
this entangling alliances hinges on French and German immunity and the competing

207
00:13:22.991 --> 00:13:26.860
interests of Russia and Austria,

208
00:13:26.861 --> 00:13:29.560
Hungary in the Balkans.

209
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:35.230
And it also hinges on Bismarck who was in many ways an odious guy,

210
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.110
but very,
very clever guy.

211
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:43.500
His fear that Germany would have to fight a war on two fronts.

212
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:50.050
And so what these powers are doing or looking for allies,
and as Bismark said,

213
00:13:50.051 --> 00:13:53.740
it's interesting he said it in French showing that in many ways French was still

214
00:13:53.741 --> 00:13:58.210
the language of diplomacy.
He said in a,
when you've got these great powers,

215
00:13:58.211 --> 00:14:01.300
five of them in quotes,

216
00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.480
you have to be Artois.
There have to be,

217
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:08.410
you have to be with the free and not the two.

218
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.880
And its worst nightmare in Bismarck was somebody who he said he liked the lie

219
00:14:12.881 --> 00:14:15.260
awake at night and hate,
uh,

220
00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:20.470
his worst fear was having to fight the Russians and having to fight the French

221
00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:22.180
at the same time.

222
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.410
And so when he encourages the French to get into the imperial game at the

223
00:14:26.411 --> 00:14:29.260
beginning,
he's doing that to try to,
you know,

224
00:14:29.261 --> 00:14:32.620
he tried to get them to blow off a little steam out there in Africa.

225
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.510
My Map of Africa is here,
remember the,

226
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:40.270
the line about the map of the map of Europe.
And so his,
he said,

227
00:14:40.271 --> 00:14:41.350
here's the exact quote,

228
00:14:41.351 --> 00:14:45.210
all international politics reduces itself to this formula.
Try to be a 12.

229
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:49.990
As long as the world is governed by the unstable equilibrium of five great

230
00:14:49.991 --> 00:14:52.580
powers,
Germany,
Austria,
Hungary,
Russia,

231
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:57.500
Britain and France.
And these treaties,

232
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:59.810
these arrangements,

233
00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:04.430
that is the emergence of the triple alliance and the emergence of the triple

234
00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:08.360
entente.
Uh,
the,
you know,
at the time of the war,

235
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:13.700
these are,
uh,
these are,
you know,
Italy is a,

236
00:15:13.701 --> 00:15:15.530
is,
is up for grabs,

237
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:20.360
open to the highest bidder and Italy will go to war despite having been a member

238
00:15:20.361 --> 00:15:23.690
of original of the alliance with Austria,
Hungary and Germany.

239
00:15:23.691 --> 00:15:28.160
It will go to war on the allied side because the allies promise the more in

240
00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:31.700
1915.
Um,
but that,
that's another story,

241
00:15:31.701 --> 00:15:35.000
but that's very important in the emergence of fascism in Italy because Italy

242
00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:39.170
after the war though,
nominally victorious does not get what it wants.

243
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.420
It does not get the donation coast.

244
00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.810
It does not get the [inaudible] mountains,
uh,

245
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.220
because if you fought a war based on national claims,
why turn around give,

246
00:15:49.221 --> 00:15:53.750
give regions and they have only a minority of Italian populations to Italy and

247
00:15:53.751 --> 00:15:55.740
Benito Mussolini,
uh,

248
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.250
goes from being a socialist to being a fascist helps create that party.
Uh,

249
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.470
based upon this idea that Italian Italy had been screwed.

250
00:16:03.471 --> 00:16:06.140
They never got what they were supposed to in,
in,
in World War One.

251
00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.250
And so that's how he comes to power as a fascist.
Didn't,
as you know,
in,

252
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:15.650
in 1922,
so in 1879,

253
00:16:15.651 --> 00:16:20.540
Bismarck forges this cornerstone alliance between Germany and Austria,
Hungary,

254
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:21.381
uh,

255
00:16:21.381 --> 00:16:26.381
and it's predicated on German support for Habsburg opposition to the expansion

256
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:31.010
of Russian interests in the Balkans.

257
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:35.930
And you can see in this the origins of the famous blank check in the summer,

258
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:40.270
hot summer as it was in 1914 and in the,

259
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.250
in 1880 Italy allies with Germany and Austria,

260
00:16:43.251 --> 00:16:45.560
Hungary forming the triple alliance.

261
00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.450
But the wording is such that,
uh,
it doesn't necessarily bring Italy in,

262
00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:54.320
into the war.
And as I said,
Italy will come in and I'm the side to Austria,

263
00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:59.400
Germany,
Austria,
Hungary and Germany and Italy comes in,
uh,
as I just said,
uh,

264
00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:04.420
in 1915 now the details of these treaties and these,

265
00:17:04.521 --> 00:17:08.120
these,
these diplomats are still under the influence of Metro neck and,
and,

266
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:12.740
and all that,
that the details are not known,
but the,
but the,
the outlines are,

267
00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.220
are,
are,
are known.
I mean,
the details are,
uh,
uh,
are not known,

268
00:17:16.221 --> 00:17:20.680
but the outlines of these trees are,
are basically,
um,
um,
uh,

269
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.640
basically no.
And at one seem right through the period is every time,

270
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:31.220
every time that Russia seeks to expand its influence in the Balkans,

271
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:35.990
Austria,
Hungary gets concerned and they turned to Germany saying,

272
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:39.620
uh,
you will back us.
You will back us,
won't you?
When they say yes,

273
00:17:39.621 --> 00:17:40.700
of course we will back you.

274
00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:45.140
And in the end what happens is that the blank check goes to,
uh,

275
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:49.010
after the ultimatum to Serbia by Austria,
Hungary,
uh,

276
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:54.030
do whatever you want to settle the situation.
We will vacuum all the way.

277
00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:59.780
Now why does Germany become encircled a diplomatically and ultimately in war?

278
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:09.350
How does it happen that Russia czarist autocratic Russia allies with Republican

279
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.310
France that the czar,
the oppressor of,

280
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.830
of the non Russian people's,
especially the Jews,
uh,

281
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:27.140
in Russia comes to Paris in 1889 and they name a beautiful bridge after him.

282
00:18:27.661 --> 00:18:31.170
The poem at least twice the bridge of Alexander is a third.

283
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:36.830
And that the marine band learns the theme song of the Czars

284
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.250
and the Socialists go wild in France.

285
00:18:41.251 --> 00:18:44.340
And how can you ally with these people who are repressing?

286
00:18:44.341 --> 00:18:47.730
Socialists are oppressing nationalities.
There were oppressing everybody.

287
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.160
And run this,
this,
this police state.

288
00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:55.760
And so the last thing that Bismarck wanted are these two big states to,

289
00:18:55.891 --> 00:19:00.090
um,
to come together on either side of him.

290
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:01.830
How does this happen?

291
00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:07.460
Both France and Russia are outside of the triple alliance,
uh,

292
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:12.090
which you already know,
but there's another reason.
As a matter of fact,

293
00:19:12.091 --> 00:19:13.440
I read about four or five years ago,

294
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:18.470
there are still French companies trying to get their money back from Russia

295
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:23.000
because they lost their money in 1917,
uh,

296
00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:28.220
when the Bolsheviks came to power and ultimately nationalized industries,

297
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:33.450
big industries particularly,
it is economic,
uh,
in that,

298
00:19:33.451 --> 00:19:36.720
one of the old things that people say about the French economy,

299
00:19:36.721 --> 00:19:40.590
but it's still true,
is that French money,
uh,

300
00:19:40.591 --> 00:19:44.550
investments,
much of it goes outside of France.

301
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:48.270
They'd build the railroads in Spain,
uh,

302
00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:53.100
but they invest heavily in Russian industry and in Russian,
uh,
railroads.

303
00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:58.470
Uh,
and so these economic ties are very important.
I mean,

304
00:19:58.471 --> 00:20:01.410
there are also cultural ties.
I mean,
because of the,
you know,

305
00:20:01.411 --> 00:20:04.950
because of the popularity of French in the,
in aristocratic circles within,

306
00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:08.520
in Russia.
But in other hand,
there were lots of Russian nobles who spoke German,

307
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:11.810
uh,
you know,
who lived in Koenigsberg,
which is still,
you know,

308
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.050
the sort of enclave now that is that it is still part of a Russia sort of stuck

309
00:20:16.051 --> 00:20:19.810
between Poland and Lithuania.
Um,

310
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.700
but the most important reason is that Russian invest French investment in Russia

311
00:20:23.701 --> 00:20:28.680
increases dramatically in the 1880s and 1890s.
And that,
you know,

312
00:20:28.681 --> 00:20:33.681
France seeks and ally against Germany and that relations between Russia,

313
00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:40.340
uh,
and,
and Germany and this is already obvious,

314
00:20:40.341 --> 00:20:42.980
you've already discerned this,
uh,
are,
are,

315
00:20:42.981 --> 00:20:47.981
are going to deteriorate because of this Tinder relationship between Austria,

316
00:20:48.011 --> 00:20:50.650
Hungary and uh,
uh,

317
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.110
and Germany over the Balkans.

318
00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.270
And in the very end,
I mean,
one of the,

319
00:20:56.271 --> 00:21:00.250
the ludicrous aspects of this whole damn thing is it just as they're about to go

320
00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:03.490
to war and just as,
as a Tsar Nicholas,

321
00:21:03.491 --> 00:21:07.060
the second about whom we'll come back and discuss one day,
um,

322
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:12.460
he signs the mobilization order and mobilization for reasons I'll come back to

323
00:21:12.461 --> 00:21:14.110
is tantamount to an act of war.

324
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:19.300
He's dashing off letters to his dearest cousin willy.

325
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:24.160
And really is writing back to my dear cousin Nikki.
These people are related,

326
00:21:24.161 --> 00:21:24.994
they're cousins,

327
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:31.110
but international circumstances and the tensions over the bulk and French fears

328
00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.530
of Germany,
uh,

329
00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:41.010
bring Russia and France together and the French were in band sing or plays a

330
00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.420
whatever the theme song of,
of the Russians.
Ours is when they,

331
00:21:47.421 --> 00:21:52.030
it certainly wasn't doctors,
Trivago,
but whatever when,
when,
when they arrive.
Um,

332
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:57.880
and so for the Russian government that blames Austria,
Hungary,
uh,
for,
uh,

333
00:21:57.881 --> 00:22:01.510
trying to undercut what they view as their logical,
uh,

334
00:22:01.511 --> 00:22:04.540
influence in the Balkans,
um,

335
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:09.550
and Germany will back them right away.
So in 1892,

336
00:22:09.551 --> 00:22:13.780
France and Russia sign a military treaty,
uh,
that,

337
00:22:13.781 --> 00:22:17.020
that says,
uh,
that,
that there'll be a military response if,

338
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:22.090
if the other word attacked by Germany or by one or more of its allies and they

339
00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:26.500
form a formal alliance in 1894.

340
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:30.790
Now what about Britain?
What about Britain?

341
00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:33.280
Now,

342
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:38.280
one of the things that the British don't want to ally with anybody and they're

343
00:22:38.921 --> 00:22:41.890
on bad terms with the French and they're on bad terms with the Russians.

344
00:22:41.891 --> 00:22:45.340
To make a long story short,
the great game as they called it,

345
00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:49.900
a rivalry over Afghanistan,
over the entire universe or extension of that,

346
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:54.340
that frontier in,
into,
um,
into uh,
uh,

347
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:58.750
into Asia,
uh,
means that,
uh,

348
00:22:58.751 --> 00:23:02.230
the chances of of Great Britain,

349
00:23:02.231 --> 00:23:04.580
Britain joining an alliance,
uh,

350
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.890
with in alliance with Russia and with France seems,
uh,

351
00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:12.220
extremely dim.

352
00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.570
Britain wants to control the seas and to go it alone,

353
00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:18.530
but they discover a,

354
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:23.630
a fact it shouldn't have surprised them in the Boer War in South Africa is they

355
00:23:23.981 --> 00:23:25.180
don't have any friends.

356
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.110
The nobody supports what they're doing in South Africa.

357
00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.350
And it's better to have an ally in a,

358
00:23:32.351 --> 00:23:36.130
in a world that gets increasingly dangerous.
Um,

359
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.760
and what happens Oh,

360
00:23:39.761 --> 00:23:43.870
gradually is that the rivalry between Germany,

361
00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:45.140
again,

362
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:50.140
make a long story short between Germany and Britain ultimately will cause

363
00:23:50.721 --> 00:23:52.840
Britain to look for,
uh,

364
00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:58.050
allies and that suddenly it seems less probable that that France and Britain

365
00:23:59.901 --> 00:24:04.580
will go to war.
Now what is the nature of this,
uh,

366
00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:09.530
this,
uh,
increasingly bitter rivalry between Germany and Britain?

367
00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:14.480
One is obvious Africa.
That's one

368
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:18.440
second economic

369
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.050
in that the German economy is growing by leaps and bounds.

370
00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:28.640
It is the number one country in,
in,
in,
in chemistry,
the chem,
the hope.

371
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.160
Those of you that are there are chemists.
The whole,
you know,

372
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:33.520
the university system,
uh,
we're in,

373
00:24:33.521 --> 00:24:38.300
in Britain university system isn't terribly practical,
but in,
in Germany that,

374
00:24:38.301 --> 00:24:41.870
you know,
chemistry is part of what,
what,
what they do in the German universities,

375
00:24:41.871 --> 00:24:46.520
which are great universities and they begin to lap the British in,

376
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:51.100
in,
in,
in chemistry,
chemical productions.
Uh,

377
00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:55.670
and they catch up and go ahead and steal too.
And so,
um,

378
00:24:55.850 --> 00:25:00.020
this is a big rivalry.
I and the British government is be,

379
00:25:00.021 --> 00:25:04.520
it begins to run a scared because the city is running scared.

380
00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:09.830
And third is this famous naval rivalry that which Paul Kennedy and my colleague

381
00:25:09.831 --> 00:25:10.760
and friend has written a book,

382
00:25:10.761 --> 00:25:15.761
the Anglo German naval rivalry is that the Germans start turning off these huge

383
00:25:16.551 --> 00:25:20.510
ships and then the British respond.

384
00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:24.020
They produced the dreadnought,
which becomes a symbol for these huge,

385
00:25:24.021 --> 00:25:25.610
powerful battleships,

386
00:25:25.611 --> 00:25:29.960
powerful battleships that says nothing had ever been seen before.
And,
uh,

387
00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:34.880
the millet,
the naval leagues in both countries.
Again,

388
00:25:34.881 --> 00:25:39.540
this is the culture of imperialism,
the culture of,
of aggressive nationalism.
Ah,

389
00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:44.420
put huge pressure on governments to throw every available resource in the

390
00:25:44.421 --> 00:25:49.190
building of,
of,
of more and more,
uh,
ships and Britain,

391
00:25:49.191 --> 00:25:53.450
which has all always controlled,
basically controlled the seas since the,

392
00:25:53.451 --> 00:25:56.240
the armada and the late,
uh,

393
00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:59.570
a defeat of the Spanish armada and the late 16th century.

394
00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:04.460
They're running scared now again,
you know,
you can't look ahead and say,
Aha,

395
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:07.580
but there was only one naval battle of any consequence in,
in,
in,
uh,

396
00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:12.740
in World War One,
uh,
w at the battle of Jutland off the coast of Denmark.

397
00:26:12.741 --> 00:26:14.150
And,
and it's,
it's kind of a draw,

398
00:26:14.151 --> 00:26:16.820
but basically the Germans are forced back into port,
so they lose.

399
00:26:16.821 --> 00:26:18.860
But nobody in the British couldn't anticipate that.

400
00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:24.580
So their fear of Germany and the saber rattling of the thoroughly irresponsible

401
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:29.300
idiot,
uh,
of Wilhelm,
the second,
uh,

402
00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:34.480
helps make it possible to imagine in alliance with this Nikki French.

403
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:41.100
Now in the 1890s,
there were a lot of war novels,
uh,

404
00:26:41.101 --> 00:26:42.470
about future wars.

405
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:46.260
And this in itself reflects the fact that that many people thought there would

406
00:26:46.261 --> 00:26:47.220
be another war.
Again,

407
00:26:47.221 --> 00:26:49.320
they didn't know it's gonna be a war of four and a half years,

408
00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:53.550
but they think they're going to be another war.
And when I,
I assure you,

409
00:26:53.551 --> 00:26:55.110
I've never read the following book,

410
00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:58.960
but one of the more successful was uh,
uh,

411
00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:02.920
for a brief time with this sort of book about um,

412
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.130
a future war and it's in the area,

413
00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.880
I guess that's in the early eighties and nineties or about the time of a show to

414
00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:11.620
me,
but it's in the 80s,
1890s,
or maybe the first couple of years of the,

415
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:15.930
of the 20th century.
It doesn't matter.
Dover,

416
00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:22.170
the middleclass of Dover are out parading in the rain round in the rain on a

417
00:27:22.171 --> 00:27:25.530
Sunday morning,
miserable weather.

418
00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:30.390
And they suddenly find that Dover's been taking over,

419
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:35.870
taking over by the sneaky French that they've been digging a tunnel under the

420
00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:37.883
English Channel.

421
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.610
Now there was no Napoleon wanting to dig a tunnel under the channel.

422
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.850
There is a tunnel under the English Channel,
the channel,

423
00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.880
the trains rocket along at least until they got to Britain and then who could

424
00:27:47.881 --> 00:27:50.010
applaud along at about two kilometers an hour.

425
00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:52.340
But then they've improved that side of it anyway.

426
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:56.530
There's sort of a French bias but too bad.
Um,
so they,

427
00:27:56.531 --> 00:28:00.870
they suddenly find that there's a strolling along in the pouring rain horizontal

428
00:28:00.871 --> 00:28:05.871
rain that as these sneaky French that there were soldiers all over and taking

429
00:28:06.001 --> 00:28:10.350
these sort of national stereotypes.
It's the French are disguised as waiters.

430
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:14.790
It wearing dirty waiter uniforms and under there,

431
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.640
this is the British image.
I would even comment on,

432
00:28:17.641 --> 00:28:19.920
you know what English kitchens would have been like or something,

433
00:28:19.921 --> 00:28:23.040
but I had to be a cheap shot.
But,
uh,
under these,

434
00:28:23.041 --> 00:28:27.970
under these towels where a sneaky weapons,
uh,

435
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:32.990
and they take over Dover and then of course the British get it together and they

436
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:38.400
drive them back into the tunnel and shoot a few and then they submit up the

437
00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:43.680
tunnel and then parliament passes lots of more battleship bills,

438
00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.310
et Cetera,
et cetera.
The future,
future novel.

439
00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:50.520
But there's another one four or five years later,

440
00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:52.590
and I haven't read this one either and I ain't going to read it.

441
00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.970
And the people in Whitby speaking of uh,
or Scarborough,

442
00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:01.800
speaking of horizontal rain,
uh,
in the east coast,

443
00:29:01.801 --> 00:29:06.540
they wake up and they see these huge German battleships just lobbing shells that

444
00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:10.650
can reach and blow up in York,
lobbing one shell after another.

445
00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.020
And the sequel isn't very interesting,

446
00:29:13.021 --> 00:29:15.090
but the bridge parliament passes even more bills.

447
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:19.950
And then the battle of the battleships of the good guys in quotes go and blow up

448
00:29:19.951 --> 00:29:24.050
the battleship to the bad guys.
And,
and everybody can go back to,
uh,
uh,

449
00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.950
eating odd things on a Sunday morning.

450
00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:32.030
So how does it happen that that scenario is reversed and what,

451
00:29:33.431 --> 00:29:36.210
what the future will be?
Well,
I've just explained it,

452
00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:40.740
it has to do with the fears of,

453
00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:46.560
of these states of Germany and that the crises,

454
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:51.580
which you can read about the Moroccan crises in 1905,

455
00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:56.590
uh,
it makes even firmer this military alliance,

456
00:29:56.591 --> 00:29:59.770
it's called an entente or,
or which I word in English too,

457
00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:03.850
or a an understanding.
But basically it's an alliance.
And by 1905,

458
00:30:03.851 --> 00:30:06.580
they were already saying,
look,
our navy,
the British navy,

459
00:30:06.581 --> 00:30:08.470
we'll take care of the North Sea and the channel,

460
00:30:08.471 --> 00:30:12.070
and you guys take care of the Mediterranean.
Uh,
the,

461
00:30:12.071 --> 00:30:16.120
the crisis in 1911,
the second Moroccan crisis,
uh,

462
00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:21.010
which you know,
which pushes a Germany and France close to war,

463
00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:24.850
uh,
affirms all of the above things that I've said.
Now,

464
00:30:24.851 --> 00:30:27.970
don't get the idea that in 19,
uh,

465
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:32.700
11 things are more dangerous than 1910 and 1910,
they're more dangerous.

466
00:30:32.701 --> 00:30:35.890
In 19 nine,
again,
this or hydraulic model of everything,

467
00:30:35.891 --> 00:30:38.890
pressure building up and finally there is war.
It doesn't work like that,

468
00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:44.640
but that these alliances become firmed up and of these,

469
00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:50.380
uh,
you know,
these great powers,
um,
that,

470
00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:55.450
that Britain and France and Russia ended up in.

471
00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.960
Bismarck was dead by then,
but in his worst,

472
00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:03.670
worst nightmare of being a twat of being three.

473
00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:09.930
Now the French by the Va had another reason to be particularly,

474
00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.210
yeah,
particularly,

475
00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:19.260
particularly eager to have an alliance is that an odd thing happens in la.

476
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:24.190
Better false.
In most of France,

477
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.680
the French population stops growing.

478
00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:32.340
It just stops as of 1846 47 it's regionally specific in Brittany and in,

479
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:39.160
in the the,
the ovarian,
you in the center of France,

480
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:43.360
people are still turning out babies.
You still have huge families.

481
00:31:43.361 --> 00:31:46.870
We have friends.
One of them just died for older people and they were,

482
00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:51.550
grew up in misery in the mountains,
misery.
They had 13 children in 12 children.

483
00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:56.440
They were one of the 12 or 13 children.
But in most of France,

484
00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.980
that's not the case.
And in one part of southwestern France,

485
00:31:59.981 --> 00:32:02.560
when people had a second baby,
they received a condolence card.

486
00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.820
Isn't that bizarre?
The French population stops growing.

487
00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:11.860
Why there a couple of reasons.
This is just an aside,
but it's interesting.

488
00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:15.340
The Napoleonic code remember ends primogeniture.

489
00:32:15.341 --> 00:32:20.341
So you've got to divide up the plot of land into the two or three or an to a

490
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:25.180
birth control.
There's two arguments is that the peasants started,
uh,

491
00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.720
and then it filters up to the middle classes or the middle class starts and

492
00:32:28.721 --> 00:32:30.730
filters down.
It depends on where in France,

493
00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:36.070
but they stop having children.
Look at this,

494
00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.890
I wrote it on board but,
and maybe in the book,
hadn't even remember,

495
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:43.670
but here's live births.
1908 1913 per a thousand,

496
00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:48.710
uh,
Italy 32.4,
Austria,
31.9,

497
00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:53.930
Germany,
29.3,
England 24.9,

498
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:59.150
USA 24.3,
France 19.5.

499
00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:00.800
That means that his solo,

500
00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.950
the French population would have literally not grown had it not been for

501
00:33:03.951 --> 00:33:07.700
immigrants,
immigrants then where people coming from Italy and from Switzerland,

502
00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:12.350
but mostly from mostly from Italy and from Spain to some and from Belgium.

503
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.930
So what's the effect of this is,

504
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:22.100
is that there's this enormous crisis it has to do also with this sort of

505
00:33:22.101 --> 00:33:25.580
threatened realty.
Why do we have fewer children with some matter with us?

506
00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:29.960
Francis became into a feminine,
etc. Etc.
You can just hear the language of this.

507
00:33:29.961 --> 00:33:33.770
Women are not serving this date.
Why are they not having babies anymore?

508
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:38.180
What's the matter?
They want to vote.
Uh,
is this getting in the way with having a,

509
00:33:38.181 --> 00:33:41.030
having a,
uh,
babies?
It can be sent off to war.

510
00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:46.250
So it causes an enormous problem and it's discussed all over the place,

511
00:33:46.251 --> 00:33:48.680
particularly by,
by the nationalists.

512
00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:53.920
We don't have enough children jumping ahead and I'll come back to this very

513
00:33:55.341 --> 00:33:56.174
done.

514
00:33:56.390 --> 00:34:01.390
1916 the Germans say we're not going to take the forts at done there in

515
00:34:02.061 --> 00:34:05.930
printable in prem.
Unshakeable,
uh,
cannot be taken.

516
00:34:05.931 --> 00:34:08.840
They cannot be pre,
um,
what,

517
00:34:08.841 --> 00:34:13.841
but we will make them pay so many hundreds of thousands of people that we will

518
00:34:15.261 --> 00:34:18.200
bleed them and there'll be forced to sue for peace.

519
00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:22.340
There wasn't fucking Heine was the general,
we won't take the forts do,

520
00:34:22.341 --> 00:34:27.341
I'm on Vole but we will kill so many hundreds of thousands of people and we can

521
00:34:27.681 --> 00:34:31.190
afford to have lose a hundreds of thousands of people because our birth rate is

522
00:34:31.191 --> 00:34:35.510
higher.
Nice for the people sent into all of this stuff.
More about that later.

523
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:38.600
So this has a big effect.
You know,

524
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:43.750
if you're going to go to war and get Alsace and run back and it's,

525
00:34:43.971 --> 00:34:47.450
Germany gets more and more aggressive,
irresponsible,

526
00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:51.680
no question about it.
In an age of aggressive nationalism,

527
00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:56.450
you better have somebody else to help you out.

528
00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:02.180
Cause there was a lot of them and they blew us away in 1870,

529
00:35:02.181 --> 00:35:05.300
71.
And they,
they defeated,

530
00:35:05.301 --> 00:35:07.460
they didn't blow away but they've faded Austria,

531
00:35:07.461 --> 00:35:12.461
Prussia defeated Austria in 1866 cementing its role as the most important power

532
00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:17.570
in,
uh,
in,
uh,
in Europe.
So,
um,

533
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:23.240
that helps as well.
Now

534
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:28.370
the French fears and all that.

535
00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:33.590
Now a couple more
points.

536
00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:36.560
I just want to give you an example from this,
and I mentioned it just briefly,

537
00:35:36.561 --> 00:35:39.090
but it's about how this works,

538
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:44.360
how small incidents in a complicated world of national rivalries and competing

539
00:35:45.991 --> 00:35:50.160
identities can almost,
almost launched.
The war took Bam.

540
00:35:50.161 --> 00:35:54.000
It took the assassination of Francis Ferdinand.
The started all off.

541
00:35:54.001 --> 00:35:57.560
There would've been a war sometime.
And this is the case of [inaudible].

542
00:35:57.561 --> 00:36:02.400
Erin in German is [inaudible] in French Sav,

543
00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:06.720
er,
any,
a very nice little town went designer and got to see all these places.

544
00:36:06.721 --> 00:36:11.670
I went to sovereign,
there's nice canal runs through it now I'll sauce.

545
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:16.560
And so I was woo,
we're next to France in 1681,

546
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:20.600
uh,
by,
uh,
the [inaudible] maniac,
uh,

547
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:25.610
Louis the 14th says they had been part of France a very long time and in 1871

548
00:36:26.821 --> 00:36:31.650
for reasons,
you know,
they become part of,
of,
of,
um,

549
00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:36.120
uh,
of Germany.
But this incident adds a van.

550
00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:42.020
What it does is it reinforces the stereotypes that the French have a of the

551
00:36:42.121 --> 00:36:46.080
Germans and the Germans have,
uh,
uh,
of,

552
00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:47.160
of the French,

553
00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:52.250
the image of German quest for domination and aggressiveness and the role of the

554
00:36:53.431 --> 00:36:57.660
German army,
which seems to know,
have absolutely no,
uh,

555
00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:02.370
no limits as that someone once said about pressure that it was,
uh,
uh,
uh,

556
00:37:02.371 --> 00:37:04.440
it was a state tacked onto an army.

557
00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:09.620
And the Zoll veteran affair seem to indicate that Germany,
uh,
was,
uh,

558
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:11.550
still,
uh,
the same way.

559
00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:16.290
Now if you go up to Alsace,
you go up to the voltage mountains,

560
00:37:16.291 --> 00:37:19.670
there's this route called the Husa.
They cracked her.
So the root of the,
of,

561
00:37:19.671 --> 00:37:20.820
of the peaks.

562
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:25.860
And you can look down into the bush,
which was France,

563
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:30.750
you know,
until 19,
uh,
still is France.
But,
uh,
from what had been,

564
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.750
um,
uh,
uh,
German el sauce.

565
00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:38.430
And you can see all of these monuments put up by German hiking clubs,
uh,
uh,

566
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:42.570
a a to try to reaffirm this German identity,
uh,
that,

567
00:37:42.571 --> 00:37:46.950
that people had and identity is extremely,
extremely complex thing.

568
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.820
But,
um,
first of all,
um,

569
00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:54.120
what is clear is that the vast majority of the population spoke German.
Now,

570
00:37:54.121 --> 00:37:56.980
whether this makes them feel German or not,
that,
that that's,
you know,
it's,

571
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.870
it's not sure,
but let me give you a couple examples.
I didn't send this around.

572
00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:06.030
It's too much,
but let's say that for the total of a Gr of Alsace and Lorraine,

573
00:38:06.031 --> 00:38:10.700
the parts that were annexed into,
uh,
the German of hike,
um,

574
00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:15.740
that is a number of communes that in which German with the dominant German

575
00:38:16.831 --> 00:38:18.240
dialect was the dominant language.

576
00:38:18.241 --> 00:38:23.241
It's 1,225 in which French was the dominant language was 385.

577
00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:28.170
Um,
and the percentage of the population has spoke German.

578
00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:30.480
It's 77%.

579
00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:34.290
The population that spoke French as their major language,

580
00:38:34.291 --> 00:38:39.291
12% are some bilingualism but not a whole lot actually and 10% sort of neither.

581
00:38:39.581 --> 00:38:43.920
And that they were probably more or less perfectly bilingual because of uh,

582
00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:48.970
uh,
because of uh,
of intermarriage.
Um,
and so,
you know,

583
00:38:48.971 --> 00:38:53.410
when the Germans come in,
um,
in,
you know,

584
00:38:53.411 --> 00:38:57.750
after 1871,
they are better than what the French did after we were one.

585
00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:02.430
The French tried to just,
just rip German out as a language of,
of,

586
00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:06.430
of instruction,
get rid of all the street signs in German.

587
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:11.590
The Germans are a little more delicate in the way that they do things,

588
00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:16.840
but they want German is,
is,
is,
uh,
is the language of the administration.

589
00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:21.090
But another important point is that they don't trust the l sessions,

590
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.350
even though they speak German,

591
00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:28.530
they don't trust them that Alsace and those parts of Loran are not there or next

592
00:39:29.051 --> 00:39:29.890
into the hike,

593
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.180
but they don't have the same rights as a region that the other parts of Germany,

594
00:39:34.181 --> 00:39:39.010
like Virgin Bergen Bavaria have and that German deputies from Alsace.

595
00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:42.550
And those parts of the,
and don't have the right to vote on issues of war.

596
00:39:42.551 --> 00:39:44.800
For example,
in the Reichstag,

597
00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:50.220
they are not trusted because they are seen as potentially disloyal to the hike.

598
00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:58.720
The idea is that they have been infected with Frenchness.

599
00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:04.300
Now part of this is religious in that,
you know,
it's so complex.
Alsace is a,

600
00:40:04.301 --> 00:40:06.410
is a wonderfully interesting area.
Uh,

601
00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:11.430
it's has the largest percentage of Protestants in France outside of I'll dash in

602
00:40:12.671 --> 00:40:14.650
the,
in the south center.

603
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:19.660
It's also got a large percentage of Jews who had been victimized by antisemitic

604
00:40:19.661 --> 00:40:24.661
riots and after 1848 but the majority of population is Catholic.

605
00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:30.190
The German empire,
going back to the couture comp of Bismarck,

606
00:40:30.191 --> 00:40:33.190
the war against the Catholic still doesn't really trust the Catholics.

607
00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:36.010
You've got Catholics in Bavaria,

608
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:39.160
usually very right wing Catholics and Bavaria.

609
00:40:39.161 --> 00:40:40.600
You've got Catholics in the Rheinland,

610
00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:46.240
you've got some Catholics up north and the palatinate and you've got a lot of

611
00:40:46.241 --> 00:40:50.560
Catholics in Alsace.
And so they don't trust them,
basically don't trust them.

612
00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:56.010
And so relations between the German troops who as in the case of Spain are not

613
00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:58.060
coming from that region.

614
00:40:58.061 --> 00:41:01.750
Spanish people occupying in Catalonia come from Galicia or they come from

615
00:41:01.751 --> 00:41:02.584
Castillo.

616
00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:06.040
So they won't be infected by the local population for the point of view of the

617
00:41:06.041 --> 00:41:07.000
Spanish state.

618
00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:12.660
And so the troops that are in El sauce or not from Alsace cause they don't trust

619
00:41:13.481 --> 00:41:18.180
them.
And so tensions are very good.
And so what happens in,
in,
in,
in,
in,

620
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:19.980
in Zavon,
uh,

621
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:24.990
it a place where military civil relations aren't terribly good in this town of

622
00:41:25.271 --> 00:41:29.220
8,000 people,
uh,
is that,
uh,
uh,

623
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:32.970
there was an incident that gets blown out of proportion.
Uh,
there's a,
there's a,

624
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:35.960
um,
uh,
there's some drilling there,
drilling.

625
00:41:35.961 --> 00:41:40.010
The German soldiers are always drilling and they're drilling and,
and,
and the,
uh,

626
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.150
the,
um,

627
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:44.150
the commander makes a crack about the outstations stations and he calls him an

628
00:41:44.151 --> 00:41:49.070
extremely unfortunate scatological term that he met to refer to all our
stations.

629
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:51.770
And he essentially says,
well,

630
00:41:51.771 --> 00:41:54.920
if you beat the hell out of those people will be doing a service to all.

631
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:58.520
So this gets around.
And one of the reasons that relations weren't very good,

632
00:41:58.521 --> 00:42:01.850
this particular town is because there was a German officer who was,
uh,
uh,

633
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:05.270
had the bad idea of sleeping with a 14 year old girl.

634
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:10.880
And so some of the local guys go get this guy in this room and just pound them

635
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:15.680
into a well deserved pulp.
And so it spins out of control.

636
00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.220
And so what happens is on both sides in Berlin and Paris,

637
00:42:19.221 --> 00:42:23.120
this becomes a huge incident confirming the stereotype of the other.

638
00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:28.730
Uh,
and,
uh,
there's a nasty language.
Beckman Beckman Halweg hold veg,

639
00:42:28.731 --> 00:42:33.590
who was the chancellor then,
you know,
assess some over the top things about,

640
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:36.500
uh,
uh,
uh,
you know,
uh,
about,

641
00:42:36.501 --> 00:42:40.520
about the French and the influence of France and Alsace,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

642
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:44.110
And that the French are planning a war and the French government in a,
in a,

643
00:42:44.111 --> 00:42:48.800
in a time when there is a nationalist revival,
at least among the elites,
uh,
uh,

644
00:42:48.801 --> 00:42:52.820
in France,
they respond in kind and everything gets big titles.

645
00:42:52.821 --> 00:42:57.320
I big teach for big,
uh,
uh,
headlines and stuff like that.
Uh,
and uh,

646
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:59.180
uh,
they,
they don't go to war.

647
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:04.600
But what it does is it reaffirms the stereotypes and it,
it,

648
00:43:04.601 --> 00:43:09.601
it makes people a little more edgy now in 1913 but well before that military

649
00:43:12.111 --> 00:43:15.590
planners,
yes,
I have three minutes and that's just what I need.

650
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:20.390
Military planners are looking ahead to the next war.

651
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:26.250
The French we've already talked about,
they have a not terribly poetically,
uh,
um,

652
00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:30.770
designated plan number 18,
which is to invade El Sauce.

653
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:33.680
Lauren,
with a long,
that's all you need.

654
00:43:33.681 --> 00:43:38.510
They said a long patriotic frenzy,
fury.
All you need is to be on the offensive.

655
00:43:38.511 --> 00:43:40.250
And that's the end of it by the way.

656
00:43:40.251 --> 00:43:43.970
They invade wearing red pants and they can be shot picked out through the fog.

657
00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:48.500
Finally in 1914 till they put it a little less,
uh,
bright colors on.

658
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:53.060
Now how,
how are the Germans going to fight a war on two fronts?

659
00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:58.220
How you going to do that?
They're afraid of the Russians.
Why?

660
00:43:58.221 --> 00:44:01.790
There's a lot of Russians and the other peoples and they think it's going to

661
00:44:01.791 --> 00:44:03.740
take about two weeks for the Russian army.

662
00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:09.040
Once mobilization is declared that the big bear will roll their forces toward,

663
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:10.340
uh,

664
00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:14.990
toward the German frontier in a German Poland.

665
00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.320
So how are you going to win the war in two weeks

666
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:21.620
if you invade France?

667
00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:27.380
Not Throughout to lsaw slow em.
But if you,
you know,
invade well,
I mean,

668
00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:30.660
you know,
you're going to a big trouble.
You're gonna run into fortification.

669
00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:32.160
So how you going to invade France?

670
00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:37.230
The only way you can defeat them and a guy called Schlieffen whose name I wrote

671
00:44:37.231 --> 00:44:41.760
it in there but I sent around to you,
is that you have to invade Belgium.

672
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:43.260
And from his point of view,

673
00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:47.060
the Netherlands still Moltke his successor takes the Netherlands how they

674
00:44:47.061 --> 00:44:52.061
question Belgium had been declared independent and neutral in 1831.

675
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:59.250
If you go into Belgium,
the idea is you invade Belgium,

676
00:44:59.251 --> 00:45:03.210
you get through the big Ford at the edge,
get through the kind of rough country,

677
00:45:03.211 --> 00:45:07.460
well,
which is not too much.
And then you hit the block,

678
00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:12.450
the flatlands and you roll toward the English Channel.

679
00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:14.390
And the last thing,
sleeping is poignantly,
he said,

680
00:45:14.391 --> 00:45:17.130
it has said on his deathbed was the last soldier.

681
00:45:17.131 --> 00:45:21.150
His right arm should touch the English Channel and then you turn down and you

682
00:45:21.151 --> 00:45:25.380
put Paris in a headlock and they will sue for peace and you will beat them in

683
00:45:25.381 --> 00:45:30.180
two weeks before the big bear can come moseying along slowly.

684
00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:36.930
That's why mobilization was tantamount to an act of war because it puts,

685
00:45:36.931 --> 00:45:41.340
it starts to timetable
that they've got to feed them in two weeks.

686
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:46.050
What happens if you go through Belgium for the point of view of the British is

687
00:45:46.051 --> 00:45:49.680
bad enough to have the disease?
He Funche across the channel.

688
00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:55.140
But what if you've got the Germans and all stemmed eating moves feet?

689
00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:58.690
What if you have the Germans in na?

690
00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:04.470
What if you have the Germans across the channel to big time enemies?

691
00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:07.980
A very short choppy boat ride away.

692
00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:11.220
So what this is going to do,

693
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:16.290
it's going to reaffirm the alliance and Sir Edward Gray,

694
00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:19.650
the one who said most famously and he got it right,

695
00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:24.390
lights are going out in Europe.
They will not be released again in our lifetime.

696
00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:30.360
He at this point,
he's the,
the British hesitate,
the French said,
well,

697
00:46:30.361 --> 00:46:32.310
the word honor be struck from the,

698
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:35.730
from the British English dictionary.

699
00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:40.480
The French ambassador is chasing around,
uh,
uh,
uh,

700
00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:41.830
a high official in the,

701
00:46:41.831 --> 00:46:46.200
in the czarist regime in Russia saying you must back us all the way.

702
00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:52.250
And so the invasion guarantees that the worst nightmare of near night mirror of

703
00:46:55.291 --> 00:46:58.270
Bismark will come true.
That they will be Artois.

704
00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:04.860
And the fact that it doesn't work out for variety of reasons,

705
00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:07.960
the way the German high command,
uh,

706
00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:11.460
intended in the way Schlieffen intended.

707
00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:14.880
And Moltke means that they don't,

708
00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:20.210
for reasons I'll come back to can't get Paris in that headlock forced them to

709
00:47:20.911 --> 00:47:25.911
sue for peace and the race to the sea begins to try to out flank as an a game.

710
00:47:29.681 --> 00:47:33.670
If you will take a ridiculous analogy.
The outside Linebacker,

711
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:39.360
and they ended up at the sea and then shovels and defensive weapons like

712
00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:45.130
barbwire and machine guns become the weapons of the war.

713
00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:49.210
And that explains why there wasn't,

714
