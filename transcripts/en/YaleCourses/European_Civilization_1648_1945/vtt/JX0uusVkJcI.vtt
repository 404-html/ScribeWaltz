1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.080
I want today to talk about,
um,

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.370
the industrial revolution from a variety of,
uh,

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.860
of aspects.
I put everything on the board I put on our website.

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.250
So don't worry about copying it down and it's all pretty,
pretty obvious.

5
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:22.170
So a doing an industrial revolution,
uh,
across the century is no easy task,

6
00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:26.040
but we will do it.
And,
um,
um,
do the reading.

7
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.360
Let me just say that to the way people look at what used to be called industrial

8
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:34.110
revolution and I guess some people still call it.
That has changed dramatically,

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.370
um,
through the 1950s and end of the 1960s.

10
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:40.930
The idea of the industrial revolution was that,
uh,

11
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.020
it was the work of some genius.

12
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:47.340
He and ventures who created a mechanism mech machines in the,

13
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.350
uh,
use primarily in the textile industry,
but also in mining that,
uh,

14
00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:55.800
eliminated blocks to assembly line production.

15
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.620
And then everybody was crowded into factories and,

16
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:02.280
and the new brave world opened up.
Um,
and we'll fact,

17
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:05.670
one of the most interesting books instead of great classics is still in print,

18
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:10.110
was written by an economic historian at Harvard who's still around called David

19
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.860
Landis,
a good book called the unbound Prometheus's was,
which was basically that.

20
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.150
And some of the inventions that I briefly described in your,
in your reading,

21
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:22.710
the spinning Jenny,
et Cetera,
uh,
refer to that.

22
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.670
Well,
and then the,
that kind of,
um,

23
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.570
analysis led one to concentrate on,

24
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.730
on England where the industrial revolution,
uh,
began.

25
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:36.151
Uh,

26
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:41.151
and to view an interview industrialization as being a situation of,

27
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.660
of a,
of so winners and,
and,
and uh,

28
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.740
and losers by not going as fast.
Uh,
in,
in your reading.

29
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.100
I give you some,
uh,

30
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.770
pretty obvious examples of reasons for the industrial revolution.

31
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.340
First coming to to England,
uh,
location of,
of,

32
00:02:00.341 --> 00:02:03.540
of,
uh,
uh,
resources,
particularly coal,

33
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.550
a country which there's nowhere this 75% more than 75 miles away from the sea,

34
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.030
uh,
for cautious canals and roads,
a banking system,

35
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:16.470
fluid fluidity between classes.
Um,
uh,
a very large,

36
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.730
uh,
uh,
an increasingly larger proletariat,
uh,

37
00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:23.940
agricultural revolution,
uh,
uh,
et cetera.
Uh,

38
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:28.290
and with that kind of analysis,
those places that didn't industrial as fast,

39
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.970
uh,
industrialized as fast,
for example,
France.
So one thought,
well,
uh,

40
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.670
that they were quote unquote retarded,
a word that was used,

41
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:39.390
unfortunately at that time.
And then one tried to see why,
why not?

42
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.400
Now that analysis has been really a rejected,
uh,
greatly over,
over,

43
00:02:44.401 --> 00:02:47.420
over the past years because,
uh,
um,

44
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.390
industrial evolution is measured by more than simply large,
uh,

45
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.820
factories,
uh,
with industrial,
uh,
workers,
uh,
and,
uh,

46
00:02:56.821 --> 00:02:59.220
the number of machines.
And the more,

47
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.970
and this is the point of the beginning of this,

48
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:03.570
the more that we look at the industrial revolution,
uh,

49
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.630
the more that we see that industrial revolution was first and foremost,

50
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.310
and intensification of forms of production,

51
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.390
of kinds of production that were already there.

52
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.470
And thus,
we spend more time looking at,
you know,

53
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:23.050
the intensification of artisanal production,

54
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.740
craft production of domestic industry,

55
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.180
which we've already mentioned that his people,
uh,
mostly women,

56
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:35.160
but also men and children to working in the countryside.
Uh,

57
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.170
and that,
uh,
that industrial,
uh,

58
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.920
the,
the rapid rise of,
of,
of a industrial production,
uh,

59
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:49.780
was very much a tied to traditional forms of,
of production.

60
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.500
Uh,
in Paris for example,
uh,
at the,

61
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.240
in 1871 or [inaudible] 1870,

62
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:58.510
only the average unit of production had only little,

63
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.930
slightly more than seven people in it.
Um,

64
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:05.950
so if you only look for big factories and lots of machines,
uh,

65
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.620
you'll be missing the boat on.
Um,
uh,

66
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:13.621
I'm the industrial revolution now to be sure when we think of the industrial

67
00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:18.100
revolution,
we think of Manchester,
which grew from a very small town into,

68
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.300
into this enormous,
uh,
uh,
city full of,

69
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:25.780
of what angles called the satanic mills of industrial production.

70
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:30.040
Or you think of smoking Sheffield,
uh,
also in,
in,
in,
uh,

71
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.670
in northern England.
Or you think of Birmingham in the,
in the Midlands.

72
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.280
And if you think of France,
you'll think of Lille,

73
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.170
and it's to a burgeoning and towns around it to a client who bay,

74
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.670
or you think of Santa Tn,
which was kind of Francis Manchester or in Germany.

75
00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:49.960
You think of,
uh,
uh,
of the Rhineland and their war.
Uh,

76
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:54.490
and in Italy you think of of Turin and Milan,
uh,
and in,
in,
in Russia,

77
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:58.930
you think of the Moscow and Saint Peter's per region or in Spain,

78
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.510
Barcelona.
And indeed,
those are sorts of,

79
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.800
those are classic cases of industrial concentration where you do have,
you know,

80
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.430
a really significant mechanization over a very long period of time.

81
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.630
And you do have large towns with smokey factories full of,
of,

82
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.320
of workers.
But,
but again,
uh,
this,
uh,

83
00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:19.450
and we've underestimated,
I in fact,

84
00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:22.530
the second edition has more about this and the first of what you're reading a,

85
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.230
you know,
the,
the degree of industrial production in the late Russian empire.
Um,

86
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.770
but,
but yet,
uh,
to be sure when I say that the,

87
00:05:30.771 --> 00:05:34.240
that the industrial revolution is first and foremost an intensification of forms

88
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:38.500
of,
of,
of industry that already existed.
Uh,
if you were,
you know,

89
00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:43.300
if you are a parachutist and you somehow floating down over the European,
uh,

90
00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:44.530
over Europe,
uh,

91
00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:48.640
from say the middle of the 18th century through the middle of the 19th century,

92
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.090
what you would see is that there were still all sorts of industry,

93
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:56.830
a rapid increase of industrial production that is out in the countryside,

94
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.570
does not in factories.
This done in a very traditional where w way,
uh,

95
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.590
or rural handicraft people producing all sorts of things,
you know,
still at home.

96
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.730
And there's just a marvelous book written by a woman called Maxine Burg,
a,
B e r,

97
00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:15.650
g,
a who teaches at,
um,
at,
uh,
where did you teach,
uh,

98
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:21.080
in the north of England someplace that will come to me in a minute,
um,

99
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.140
called the age of manufacturer and she reexamined even the industrial revolution

100
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.050
and discovered that for example,
the town of Birmingham,

101
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:34.910
which produced all sorts of toys,
big toy manufacturers,
that you still,

102
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:36.230
even though you had a lot of factories,

103
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.460
you still had a lot of the toys are being finished or even produced by women

104
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.550
working in the hinterland.
That is the payee payee or the,

105
00:06:45.551 --> 00:06:49.280
the,
uh,
the environs of Birmingham.

106
00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:53.740
Or if you take a Sheffield,
smokey,
Sheffield,
a grim,
uh,

107
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.490
a grim kind of place in the 19th century where they produce knives and cutlery.

108
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.570
You still had a lot of these products being finished by people out in the

109
00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:05.330
countryside.
Or if you take the north of France,

110
00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:09.260
if you think of a town like harass,
r e I,
m s,

111
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.550
famous for Champagne,
uh,
if you take class,
uh,
you know,

112
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.480
it was a big industrial center of,
but it wasn't a center of,
of,
of,

113
00:07:17.481 --> 00:07:21.500
of mechanize production until after about 1850.

114
00:07:21.501 --> 00:07:24.290
What you had is you have all these people out in the countryside,

115
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:28.790
mostly women who are doing spinning and weaving and karting and that kind of

116
00:07:28.791 --> 00:07:33.030
thing.
Or around Nasi,
which is a town in the east of France.
Um,

117
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.180
you,
it,
by 1875,

118
00:07:35.181 --> 00:07:39.800
you still had something like 75,000 women who are embroiderers working in the

119
00:07:39.801 --> 00:07:44.540
countryside.
I in rural industry,
you know,
it,
it,
it,
it intensifies.

120
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.780
And then finally at the end,
what you have is this sort of,
not at the end,

121
00:07:47.781 --> 00:07:50.510
but it depends on where you are.
You have this implosion,

122
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:55.190
implosion of work into factories.
Uh,

123
00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:58.440
and so by the end of the century,
that kind of traditional,
uh,

124
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.020
I view that one would have of the industrial revolution has really has really

125
00:08:03.021 --> 00:08:06.680
arrived,
were,
were factory production and above all in the textile industry,

126
00:08:06.681 --> 00:08:11.000
the textile industry is the leading edge of the industrial revolution,

127
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:15.500
the textile industry.
Um,
and that you have women who used to work,
you know,

128
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.700
at home,
uh,
and are now working,
uh,
in,
uh,

129
00:08:19.701 --> 00:08:24.701
in factories as what the British call a textile operatives or Switzerland.

130
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.070
You sent,
what to think of,
you know,
you think of Switzerland and you know,

131
00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:31.550
as being the famous mercenaries in the early modern period or the very wealthy

132
00:08:31.551 --> 00:08:35.270
bankers,
you know,
in our own day.
Uh,
but if you look at it,

133
00:08:35.271 --> 00:08:38.410
think of a town like Zurich,
Zurich on the lake.
Uh,

134
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.710
there was all sorts of industry in the,
with the up lands of,
of Zurich that has,

135
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:47.550
you know,
up into the hills and up even into the mountains around Zurich,
uh,

136
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.580
of a,
of a handicraft production or Austria in Austria,
Guerin empire,
Austria.

137
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.910
Also,
you know,
there's,
there's hundreds of thousands of,

138
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.850
of people working in the textile industry.

139
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.640
So the details aren't as important as the fact that to be sure you know,

140
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.950
the minds that you'll read about in Jeremy now.
Anyway,
it was just a great,

141
00:09:04.951 --> 00:09:07.920
great read.
Uh,
uh,
and,

142
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:12.360
and the factories that I will describe in a while or described by a angles,

143
00:09:12.361 --> 00:09:16.320
and I couldn't do better than that.
Uh,
you know,
our reality and they become,

144
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:19.170
you know,
the industrial experience.
And when you think of,
you know,
Detroit,

145
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:23.910
Michigan in the 1930s or Flint,
Michigan in the 1930s,
or you think about,
uh,

146
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.580
you know,
uh,
all the is now the rust belt of Connecticut,
uh,

147
00:09:28.581 --> 00:09:32.850
of Torrington and these places that were once booming industrial towns.
You know,

148
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.770
that's the kind of classic model.

149
00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:38.340
And the American model really is closer to what people used to think,

150
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:43.380
what the industrial revolution met in,
uh,
the case of,
uh,
of Europe.

151
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.300
But that's a,
you know,
not a subject for now,

152
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.350
but a couple of points a long the way.
I don't think I'll ever get to my notes,

153
00:09:49.351 --> 00:09:53.280
but it doesn't really matter.
Um,
uh,
first of all,

154
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:57.390
and this is another reason why the industrial revolution starts in England.

155
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:02.340
You can't have an industrial revolution without an agricultural revolution.

156
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:03.720
Um,

157
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.610
and because what the agriculture revolution does is increases the amount of food

158
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.900
produced.
You know,
this is going to feed your sort of burgeoning proletariat,

159
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.140
your labor force.
And this is a place,
you know,

160
00:10:16.141 --> 00:10:19.620
all of Europe increases in population.
The French population is unique.

161
00:10:19.621 --> 00:10:24.180
It stops growing in 1846 and 47.
It's simply stops,

162
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.420
skids to a halt,
but everywhere else the population grows.

163
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.170
And there are regional differences in France as there are regional differences

164
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.430
everywhere.
But the industrial revolution,
uh,
uh,
is,
uh,

165
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:40.140
depends on the agricultural revolution for a increase in food supply.
Uh,

166
00:10:40.141 --> 00:10:42.330
this makes it possible,
uh,

167
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.320
the increase in urban population,
uh,

168
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:50.990
thus also increasing the,
the,
the demand for food,
uh,

169
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:54.360
and also the agricultural revolution particularly,

170
00:10:54.361 --> 00:10:57.150
but not just in the case of England,
uh,

171
00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.850
increases capital formation of that.

172
00:10:59.851 --> 00:11:04.290
You've got this sort of surplus of money,
bucks,

173
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:05.183
pounds,

174
00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:10.320
Prune your own cash that can be invested in industry.

175
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.500
And this is precisely what happens.

176
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:17.880
So that's why the agriculture revolution I is,
is absolutely important.

177
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.460
And so these three things,
industrial revolution,

178
00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.770
agricultural revolution and the growth of cities are very much tied together.

179
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.240
Let me give you an example,
which you certainly don't have to remember,
but,

180
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.870
but you know,
think of Manchester,
Manchester.
I mean,

181
00:11:32.871 --> 00:11:36.270
I described the statistics in there that they're absolutely the growth and

182
00:11:36.271 --> 00:11:39.300
Manchester is a prodigious scary thing.

183
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.140
And I'll talk more about how a rural and urban elites are a frightened by the

184
00:11:43.141 --> 00:11:45.480
growth of cities,
uh,
particularly in Germany,

185
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.510
in France and England and in the United States later.

186
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:53.740
What the growth of Manchester does is it really changes the countryside around

187
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:56.980
and helps bring the agricultural revolution.
What are,
I mean by that?

188
00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:01.170
You find the same thing around Paris or Ron Berlin or around Warsaw almost at

189
00:12:01.171 --> 00:12:06.010
any big city that I can think of is you've got in response to this urban growth,

190
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:06.310
this,

191
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:11.310
this big of octopus of people and money of rich people and poor people will talk

192
00:12:13.061 --> 00:12:16.360
about some of the rich people next time on Wednesday.
Uh,
you've got an,

193
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.550
you've got an expand for demand for food.

194
00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:22.600
And so in that ring immediately around a city like Manchester,

195
00:12:22.601 --> 00:12:24.880
you've got a dramatic expansion of,

196
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:29.890
of people doing what they called truck farming.
You know,
they're producing,

197
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.110
they're specializing in crops,
uh,
for the urban market,
fruit,

198
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.640
vegetables,
things like that.
They specialize because there's people there.

199
00:12:39.641 --> 00:12:43.650
They're going to pay for an eat what they produce.
Uh,
you know,
take a,

200
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.270
the example of Paris or a come back and talk about with great relish some day.

201
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.910
Um,
uh,
that in the suburbs of Paris,
a place called,

202
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.030
it doesn't matter at all.
I've called Molokai,
which is,

203
00:12:55.031 --> 00:12:57.820
which is a kind of a grim part of,
of,
of eastern Paris.

204
00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.480
I used to be famous for his cherries and fruits and that kind of thing that

205
00:13:01.481 --> 00:13:04.330
they're producing for the urban market or wine.

206
00:13:04.331 --> 00:13:07.540
If you can imagine winding produced.
What a horrible idea.
Uh,
uh,

207
00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:11.020
in the region of Paris.
Well,
it's a in,
yeah.
Which is,
uh,
you know,

208
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:14.200
on the San River used to produce wine for this urban market.

209
00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.770
Then the next big ring around Manchester,
you've got,

210
00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:22.780
you've got the big fish eating the little fish,
and so they're more productive,

211
00:13:22.781 --> 00:13:24.070
more uh,
uh,

212
00:13:24.071 --> 00:13:28.540
his commercial agriculture develops and more productive,
uh,
uh,

213
00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.840
production.
That's a terrible sentence.
Uh,

214
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.350
more a greater productivity for a in response to this urban demand.

215
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:37.960
And then the,
on the far distant places,

216
00:13:37.961 --> 00:13:42.010
you have people specializing in the production of cattle that has milk and meat

217
00:13:42.011 --> 00:13:43.690
for,
for the market.
And of course,

218
00:13:43.691 --> 00:13:46.660
the other thing which goes without saying is that in the course of the 19th

219
00:13:46.661 --> 00:13:50.620
century,
you've got this,
you know,
amazing development in,
in,
in shipping.
Because,

220
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.070
you know,
pretty soon with steel and with the refrigeration and you've got,

221
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:54.671
you know,
you've got,

222
00:13:54.671 --> 00:13:58.060
you've got just like now you've got lamb arriving from New Zealand and things

223
00:13:58.061 --> 00:14:02.800
like that.
And this is largely in response to the increase of,
uh,
you know,

224
00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:07.801
of these large urban it conurbations that we used the term conurbation to,

225
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.050
uh,
to,
to,

226
00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:15.460
to describe a cities that grew up so much that the act actually,
you know,

227
00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:20.410
merge together.
Uh,
and all of that.
I mean,
the American,
uh,

228
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:24.190
northeast became a sort of a conurbation and then it's very hard to,

229
00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:28.420
we went through New Jersey to ever see where there aren't cities cause one ends

230
00:14:28.421 --> 00:14:32.250
and then the other starts.
And that becomes the case in,
in,

231
00:14:32.251 --> 00:14:36.640
in parts of northern England,
uh,
as well.
So,
um,

232
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.910
the term prodo industrialization,
there,
uh,

233
00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:44.970
is what we mean by the expansion of a industrial production along very

234
00:14:46.661 --> 00:14:49.530
traditional lines.
And what I put in parentheses there,

235
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:53.300
domestic or rural industry we already talked about.
So this,

236
00:14:53.301 --> 00:14:57.560
the first you've got this expansion of industry,
uh,

237
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.410
in the countryside.
And I'll give you one example.
Again,

238
00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:02.870
I hate to keep taking examples occasionally from France,

239
00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:06.260
but because I know knowing that best,
but the city of [inaudible],

240
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.530
which is a big soap,
uh,
producing,
uh,
city,

241
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.350
what you have is you've got an a in the first half of the 19th century,

242
00:15:12.351 --> 00:15:15.710
you've got an implosion of work into the y'all,

243
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.890
into this working class suburb of Leon called the Dakota hosts.

244
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:23.120
It doesn't matter.
Um,
though it's a neat place.
It's a really neat place.
Um,

245
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.850
and then in the 1850s,

246
00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:30.851
the people that own the silk begin to put work back out into the countryside.

247
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:33.980
Why would they do that?
Because the women working there,

248
00:15:33.981 --> 00:15:38.060
or the man working there worked for less than people living in the city.

249
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:42.800
So this again,
if you're parachuting down,
uh,
starting about 1750,

250
00:15:42.801 --> 00:15:45.220
you're going to see this.
You have to imagine,
you know,

251
00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:49.430
tens or hundreds of thousands of little dots out in the countryside.

252
00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:53.930
A and even more of them as the industrial revolution gets kicking along before

253
00:15:53.931 --> 00:15:58.580
you finally have this implosion or movement in and around cities.

254
00:15:58.581 --> 00:16:01.380
More about that.
When I talk about cities,
uh,
and,

255
00:16:01.381 --> 00:16:05.750
and I to help explain why European cities are so different than American cities

256
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:10.300
with the poor living on the outside and the rich living within and,
and,

257
00:16:10.301 --> 00:16:15.301
and large scale industrialization has a lot to do with that.

258
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:19.490
Now,
having said all of that,

259
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.710
let me talk a little bit about on there.
We'll get there my notes.
But,
uh,

260
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.580
this is fun.
Anyway.
Uh,

261
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:29.060
let me talk a little bit about women's work now.

262
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:33.620
Did the Industrial Revolution Change Women's work?

263
00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:37.970
Well,
they're continuity's in women's work,
which are extremely important.

264
00:16:37.971 --> 00:16:42.410
And ultimately there'll be changes as factory production,
uh,

265
00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:47.440
comes to a dominate in many places in industrial Europe.

266
00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.293
Um,

267
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:55.070
yet there's certain things that don't change about women's work and women's role

268
00:16:55.071 --> 00:16:59.520
in the household.
Um,
uh,
that women remain,
uh,

269
00:16:59.521 --> 00:17:03.230
the head of the family economy,
that women,

270
00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.450
whether they're married or simply,
you know,
living,

271
00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.490
living with people that they've been living with for a short or a long time run

272
00:17:10.491 --> 00:17:15.350
the family economy.
And it's true whether they are in,
uh,
in rural,
uh,

273
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:20.410
rural Switzerland and the uplands of Zurich working in the textile industry or

274
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:25.900
whether they are a textile operatives in Manchester or someplace like that.

275
00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:34.340
Um,
the industrial revolution does not change other aspects of women's work,

276
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:37.160
uh,
in that,
uh,
at least,

277
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:41.210
well into the 19th century in most parts of industrial work,
uh,

278
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:45.860
industrial Europe,
women are still working in the countryside,

279
00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:50.610
but also major,
uh,
uh,
employers of women.

280
00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:51.450
Uh,

281
00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:56.450
I don't change at all with industrialization on the classic case here too is,

282
00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:00.300
is England and that is domestic service,
domestic service.

283
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:04.680
If you are going to take England in say 1850,

284
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:10.100
the largest three categories of people doing anything are not in this order.

285
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:15.420
Uh,
but just about all of the same,
the same number,
uh,
would be,

286
00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:20.340
um,
uh,
women working as domestics.
Well,
let me say,

287
00:18:20.341 --> 00:18:24.270
just really?
Yeah.
Okay.
Women working as domestics,

288
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:27.300
uh,
or some went,

289
00:18:27.301 --> 00:18:30.930
men worked as domestics to say domestic service,
uh,

290
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.770
say textile operatives and,
uh,

291
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.670
and an important category that I'm going to talk about about later and in my

292
00:18:38.671 --> 00:18:41.430
theme of it's bitter hard to write the history of remainders,

293
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:46.320
a rural agricultural laborers,
rural proletarians,

294
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.160
and then another category of,
of women's work.
Um,
again,
which one,

295
00:18:50.161 --> 00:18:53.140
when hesitates to evoke that,
of course,
prostitution,
uh,

296
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.880
and the industrial revolution here,
uh,
it,

297
00:18:55.881 --> 00:18:59.010
it doesn't change that sad aspect of women's work.

298
00:18:59.011 --> 00:19:01.080
What it does is increases with urban growth,

299
00:19:01.081 --> 00:19:05.790
the number of people working as prostitutes,
uh,
in even very,

300
00:19:05.791 --> 00:19:09.000
very small towns,
the number of prostitutes in Paris or London,

301
00:19:09.001 --> 00:19:11.430
or simply incalculable.
Uh,
uh,

302
00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:16.230
the estimates in Paris go from a 20,000 to 100,000.
Uh,

303
00:19:16.231 --> 00:19:20.940
and lots of,
of,
of women,
uh,
were,
who were married become prostitutes,

304
00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:26.100
uh,
uh,
pool affair,
uh,
uh,
Stefan do Duwan to,
to,
uh,

305
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:30.320
uh,
pay off the bills at the end of the month.
And,
and so this sad aspect of,
of,

306
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.860
of,
uh,
uh,
women's,
uh,
uh,
work,
uh,
people,
uh,

307
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:38.300
forced into prostitution by,
uh,
uh,
by want,
uh,
uh,

308
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.770
it doesn't really change with industrialization,
uh,

309
00:19:40.771 --> 00:19:44.940
into the numbers simply get a bigger and bigger.
And of course,

310
00:19:44.941 --> 00:19:47.730
one of the results of this isn't the time to discuss this,
but,
but there's,

311
00:19:47.731 --> 00:19:50.790
there's a social sort of panic at the end of the 19th century,
you know,

312
00:19:50.791 --> 00:19:55.680
about syphilis and about venereal disease and,
and,
and all of that.
And,
and,
uh,

313
00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.230
um,
also,
which ironically helps further,
uh,

314
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.830
condemn ordinary people in elite minds,
which is a very,
you know,

315
00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:06.870
coincidence as many of the patrol or many of the clients have of prostitutes

316
00:20:06.871 --> 00:20:11.040
were a middle class males.
And no matter what country you're talking about,

317
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:15.660
um,
more about women's work,
uh,
uh,
in a,

318
00:20:15.661 --> 00:20:20.040
in a while now,
um,
in the context of factories.

319
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:24.270
Now here's again,
w you know,
history has its history too.

320
00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:29.250
And when I,
uh,
you know,
grew up the extent I ever did,
uh,
in my,

321
00:20:29.251 --> 00:20:32.700
um,
in,
you know,
as a,
as a student,
I mean,
back when I,

322
00:20:32.701 --> 00:20:36.390
when I was thinking about you're doing a dissertation and becoming an historian

323
00:20:36.391 --> 00:20:37.224
and all that stuff,

324
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:41.250
what people studied was reason I put it in quote was working class
consciousness.

325
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.870
And we were sort of children of,
uh,
you know,
of the very later,

326
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.520
the sixties or the seventies.
And,

327
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:50.010
and everybody wanted to follow the great English a story.

328
00:20:50.011 --> 00:20:53.620
And he p Thompson who wrote a monumental book called the,
uh,

329
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.370
the making of the English working class and everybody wanted to find the making

330
00:20:57.371 --> 00:21:01.900
of class conscious workers,
uh,
uh,
in various places.

331
00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.470
Uh,
and everybody wanted to study the crowd as in the crowd and the French

332
00:21:05.471 --> 00:21:08.830
revolution.
My late has a friend George Rudy's days famous book,

333
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.920
the crowd here or the crowd there.

334
00:21:11.921 --> 00:21:14.730
And the first article I ever published was called the crowd and the affair to

335
00:21:14.731 --> 00:21:18.910
the Moje April 27th,
1848.
And now I look back sometimes and things.
So,
I mean,

336
00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:23.460
who cares?
But anyway,
um,
in the 19,
uh,
eighties,

337
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:27.820
then the move kind of turned away from that.
And,
and the more people starting,
uh,

338
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:28.960
starting in the middle class,

339
00:21:28.961 --> 00:21:32.470
more about the middle class folk in the 19th century and what my friend Peter

340
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:35.740
Gay called the burr bourgeois century,
uh,
next time,

341
00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:39.580
next time around.
But nonetheless,
uh,

342
00:21:39.581 --> 00:21:43.780
you can't throw out the baby with the bath water and,
and,
and,
uh,
uh,

343
00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.240
class remains a fundamental concept.

344
00:21:46.241 --> 00:21:49.810
If you're going to understand a 19th century Europe in 20 century Europe,

345
00:21:49.811 --> 00:21:54.100
you have to under understand a social class because it was a reality.
Uh,

346
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:57.790
you know,
we live in a country now where people,
you know,
people like the sink,

347
00:21:57.791 --> 00:22:00.130
there's there,
there are no classes,
uh,

348
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:04.690
well don't get me going on the current economic,
uh,
uh,
uh,
a crisis.

349
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:09.310
Uh,
and you know,
I can,
I can remember,
uh,
people going down to the Ford plants in,

350
00:22:09.311 --> 00:22:12.040
in the Ypsilanti and Detroit and trying to get,

351
00:22:12.041 --> 00:22:14.350
trying to get people to work in those places interested in the,

352
00:22:14.351 --> 00:22:18.310
in the war against the war in Vietnam.
Uh,
and getting absolutely nowhere.

353
00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.430
And No,
and the hearing arguments that know in America,

354
00:22:21.431 --> 00:22:23.980
we don't have classes where that simply isn't true.
But anyway,

355
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.750
in the 19th century,
um,
uh,
social class was,

356
00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.010
was it was a real thing and nobody was more,

357
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.850
had nobody had a stronger class identity then the middle class.

358
00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:38.620
And that's what I'm going to talk about next time.
I can hardly wait.
Um,
but,
uh,

359
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:41.830
what we call a,
I mean,
there wasn't working class,

360
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.000
but not everybody saw themselves as workers,
uh,
you know,

361
00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:48.490
as a form of identity as opposed to something else.
I mean,

362
00:22:48.491 --> 00:22:51.730
people can have multiple identities.
When we talk about nationalism,

363
00:22:51.731 --> 00:22:55.420
that's an obvious point to make.
I mean,
people,
if you ask people who they are,

364
00:22:55.421 --> 00:22:58.300
they might say they're Protestant or they're Jewish or they're Catholic or

365
00:22:58.301 --> 00:22:59.740
they're Muslim,
uh,

366
00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:04.210
or they might say they're from this extended family or they're from this region

367
00:23:04.211 --> 00:23:07.750
that they're Bavarian or,
or,
uh,
uh,
you know,
uh,

368
00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.850
from [inaudible] or whatever.
Uh,

369
00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:14.840
but in the 19th century class a class identity,
uh,

370
00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:18.480
the sense of being workers as a class apart was a reality.
I mean that,

371
00:23:18.481 --> 00:23:20.470
that's just the way it is.
Um,

372
00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:24.670
and that was worth studying and people did some very good work on it and it's

373
00:23:24.671 --> 00:23:29.410
kind of come back to it.
It's Kinda,
it's Kinda come back.
Um,
and,

374
00:23:29.411 --> 00:23:34.120
um,
you know,
I mean anyone who's,
who's been in Britain,
uh,
we're,
we're,
you know,

375
00:23:34.121 --> 00:23:38.810
class identity is so revealed by language.
I mean,
there isn't any place I,

376
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.850
including France,
uh,
uh,
or any place else that I know,
uh,

377
00:23:42.851 --> 00:23:47.670
where a difference in accent or so revealing as to who,
not only who you are,

378
00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:51.340
where you're from,
uh,
but,
uh,
what,

379
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:56.300
who you are in terms of social class.
And so it's really just,
uh,
uh,
just amazing.

380
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:59.870
[inaudible] it remains true in France and,
and some other places there was,

381
00:23:59.871 --> 00:24:02.960
there was a strangler,
there's always the stranglers Iran in Britain.

382
00:24:02.961 --> 00:24:06.410
And there was one guy who was this sort of a hardcore killer,

383
00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:10.460
bad guy killing a bunch of people,
but 15 years ago.
And they finally,

384
00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:14.180
they get all these experts on language and,
and he'd called up,

385
00:24:14.181 --> 00:24:18.200
I guess a radio station server.
Here I am,
come and get me kind of thing.

386
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:23.420
And they had him pegged where he was within something like 10 miles of where

387
00:24:23.421 --> 00:24:26.660
they ended up arresting,
which was in Bradford,
in the north of,
uh,

388
00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:30.570
north of England.
So Latin languages is one of,
you know,

389
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:32.990
one of the ways that people reveal their class.

390
00:24:32.991 --> 00:24:35.030
But in the 19th century we're talking about,

391
00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.530
we're talking about workers and how some workers but not all began to see

392
00:24:39.531 --> 00:24:44.330
themselves as proletarians.
Uh,
and that seems like one of those trendy words,

393
00:24:44.331 --> 00:24:45.590
but it meant something to people.

394
00:24:45.591 --> 00:24:49.250
Proletarian is somebody dependent on their own labor,

395
00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:54.350
usually unskilled or semiskilled,
uh,
in order to,

396
00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:57.180
uh,
in order to survive.
Um,

397
00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.320
and there are two aspects to the term proletarian ization.

398
00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:05.030
One is kind of the objective sense,
uh,

399
00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.830
that you are,
you are a laborer.
Uh,

400
00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:13.130
you may be a harvester,
you may pick grapes for the wine harvest.
Uh,

401
00:25:13.131 --> 00:25:17.720
you may be a carrying around a large boxes,

402
00:25:17.721 --> 00:25:22.610
which is what I did at Ellis loves jams and jellies in Portland,
Oregon,
uh,

403
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:27.620
or a Kellogg's of battle creek where I also work a totally unskilled.
Uh,
but,

404
00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.360
but again,
that would not be,

405
00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:34.361
that was not going to be my lifelong identity because I was able to go on to,

406
00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:37.390
uh,
do something else.
But in,
in,
in Europe,
you were,

407
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:41.430
you were born into the proletariat.
Um,
for,

408
00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:46.300
in most cases,
uh,
if you grew up as a Catholic,
you in,

409
00:25:46.301 --> 00:25:50.150
in this part of France,
you would have still been in practicing Catholic,
uh,
uh,

410
00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:54.980
uh,
a Catholic guy,
a young boy or young young girl,
young woman in,

411
00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.100
um,
in and around San tn or in Lille,

412
00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:02.570
the chances were overwhelming that you were going to follow your parents into

413
00:26:02.571 --> 00:26:06.590
the minds.
You are going to go into the minds as a matter of fact,
not say again,

414
00:26:06.591 --> 00:26:08.400
I hate giving these French examples,
but,

415
00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:11.870
but there's an expression that's really only use there that I've ever heard.

416
00:26:11.871 --> 00:26:15.770
When a kid screws up,
you know,
does something not supposed to and,

417
00:26:15.771 --> 00:26:19.130
and what they say is a deuce amend as Susan Ben,
Ben,

418
00:26:19.131 --> 00:26:21.540
which is if you spend two weeks,
you know,

419
00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:26.210
ducking down like this and having to help guide this cart full of coal up and

420
00:26:26.211 --> 00:26:29.880
down the railroad tracks,
you won't screw up like that again.
A little boy.
Uh,

421
00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.390
and you know,
the,
the,
the sense of,
uh,
you know,

422
00:26:32.391 --> 00:26:35.090
you were born into the world of work now in America,

423
00:26:35.091 --> 00:26:38.120
there were all of these kinds of literature,
the equivalent of boy's life about,

424
00:26:38.121 --> 00:26:42.770
you know,
remarkable a sense into,
you know,
into the social stratosphere.

425
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.480
You know,
uh,
that America was the land of opportunity.

426
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.160
Will America was the land of opportunity,
uh,
to be sure,
uh,

427
00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:50.760
and with the availability of land,
but,
but you know,
the,
uh,

428
00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:54.390
cases of social mobility,
we're actually a fairly limited,

429
00:26:54.391 --> 00:26:58.530
and this was certainly the case in,
in,
in,
in almost all of Europe,
you were,

430
00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:03.300
you know,
you were essentially born into for most people into this,
the status.

431
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:07.200
Now,
the other thing that happened and this explains,
it explains the rise of,

432
00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:12.410
of class consciousness is that people who suddenly the bottom drops out of their

433
00:27:14.281 --> 00:27:19.080
economic life.
It's a prayer,
fairly appropriate,
uh,
uh,
analogy for today.

434
00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:23.610
Um,
who were artisans who are craftsmen,
uh,

435
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.730
become really the first,
depending on where we're talking about,

436
00:27:26.731 --> 00:27:31.500
it begins really about the turn of the century that is 1800 slightly before but

437
00:27:31.501 --> 00:27:34.350
mostly afterward by 1830 in England.

438
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:38.100
And then follows in other countries in,
in many,

439
00:27:38.101 --> 00:27:43.101
many places where artisans and craftsmen are really the first to see themselves

440
00:27:43.981 --> 00:27:48.480
as a class apart,
not unskilled workers.

441
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:53.610
Why?
I mean this is a pretty obvious artisans and craftsmen are educated up to a

442
00:27:53.611 --> 00:27:58.200
point.
They have a sense of dignity about their trades.

443
00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:59.880
They have organizations,

444
00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:04.230
they have mutual aid societies for example or other,
uh,
you know,

445
00:28:04.231 --> 00:28:07.210
there's a craft guild organization in France called would confine you

446
00:28:07.211 --> 00:28:10.610
acknowledge this came from the medieval times when they built the big cathedrals

447
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:13.320
and all of that.
Uh,
they have organization,

448
00:28:13.321 --> 00:28:17.010
they have a sense of pride in craft dignity.
Now,
Karl Marx,

449
00:28:17.011 --> 00:28:19.020
who was pretty smart guy,
he got a lot of things wrong,

450
00:28:19.021 --> 00:28:20.790
but it got a lot of things right.
Um,

451
00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:25.710
Karl Marx wrote in the 19 and the 1830s and forties about how workers wages were

452
00:28:25.711 --> 00:28:30.420
declining.
Well,
he was right for artisans.
There's no question about it.

453
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:35.370
And artisans are at the forefront of every single social and political movement

454
00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.870
that you can think of.
Uh,
and the French revolution.
There we go.
Who,

455
00:28:38.871 --> 00:28:43.560
who stormed the bus?
T was artisans,
uh,
1830 and France,
uh,

456
00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:48.090
1848 in,
in Austria,
uh,
in Berlin,
uh,

457
00:28:48.091 --> 00:28:51.120
in Paris.
Uh,
it was artisans.

458
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:55.350
Now why all of a sudden that they get mad?
Well,
there's really two reasons,

459
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:59.670
two things that happen to artisans that that caused their economic situation to

460
00:28:59.671 --> 00:29:02.850
go down hill.
First of all,

461
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.960
the French revolution or the effects of the French revolution,
destroy the Gills.

462
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:08.250
Now,

463
00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:13.230
anybody can be a Taylor or a shoemaker or whatever,

464
00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:18.150
a glass maker if you,
you know,
if,
if you learn the skills,

465
00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:21.870
there's no one going to say,
ah,
you can't get in this union.

466
00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:25.230
You might not be able to get it in this mutual aid society or friendly society,

467
00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:28.770
but you can't do the work because the guilds are gone.
The French revolution,

468
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:33.390
you know,
banishes the guilds,
free,
free,

469
00:29:33.391 --> 00:29:38.100
uh,
economic free,
laissez faire,
Adam Smith,

470
00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:42.460
et Cetera,
et cetera.
And their law laws against unions,
uh,

471
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.660
strikes are not illegal in France,
are not legal in France till 1864.

472
00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:51.130
The corporation acts are reinforced by the fear in Britain of the French

473
00:29:51.131 --> 00:29:51.964
revolution.

474
00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:56.860
But what happens is you've got what can be called bill sule is called at that a

475
00:29:56.861 --> 00:29:59.770
friend of mine in Chicago,
uh,
the crisis of expansion.

476
00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:03.700
You've got all these people now who say,
Hey,
I'm going to be a tailor to,

477
00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:09.450
and if you lived in Berlin or someplace in the 1840 as you would here,

478
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:13.100
Taylor's walking along the street with,

479
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:17.230
with pushing carts full of clothes that they had made from the beginning to the

480
00:30:17.231 --> 00:30:21.070
end of suits being sold for practically nothing.
Why?

481
00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:25.000
Because there's so many other people making suits as well.

482
00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:30.270
And also mechanize production means that you can buy suits off the rack and

483
00:30:30.851 --> 00:30:34.000
they're getting very little for their suits.
They didn't wake up and think,
Geez,

484
00:30:34.001 --> 00:30:37.270
I can't remember how to make a suit.
They got these suits.

485
00:30:37.271 --> 00:30:40.300
They can make them and they can't sell them and their wages are declining.

486
00:30:40.301 --> 00:30:43.150
Are they mad?
They're furious.
Who Do they blame?

487
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:47.080
They blame the state and they blame the bourgeoisie,

488
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:50.890
the middle classes,
the middlemen.
For example,

489
00:30:50.891 --> 00:30:53.620
in the case of tailors there a lot of middlemen who've got capital.

490
00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.360
So what do you do?
You say,
look,

491
00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.150
I'm going to get a bunch of suits made and here hear all these tailors.

492
00:30:58.151 --> 00:30:59.110
They don't have enough to work.

493
00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:02.620
I'm giving you a really good example because I don't know a damn thing about

494
00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:06.640
about being a tailor,
but they said,
okay,
you guys do the sleeves,

495
00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.260
all you do the sleeves,

496
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.190
you guys do the pants cause you can do them all one after another and don't have

497
00:31:12.191 --> 00:31:15.910
to worry about doing the rest of it.
Then I'll pick up everything that you make.

498
00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.730
So this is a continuation of rural industry,

499
00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:23.500
and then I will sell it in the markets,
uh,
uh,
in the,

500
00:31:23.501 --> 00:31:28.150
into the middle of the 19th century.
I know I'm into to the World War One.

501
00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:32.890
You still had single women in Paris now chained to their sewing machine.

502
00:31:32.891 --> 00:31:33.521
Not Literally,

503
00:31:33.521 --> 00:31:37.150
but they've got to pay off the sewing machine after a sewing machine starts

504
00:31:37.151 --> 00:31:38.050
before electricity.

505
00:31:38.051 --> 00:31:41.800
But after Trissy comes along and they're working by themselves,

506
00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:46.270
not their day isn't cut short anymore by that,
by the end of daylight,

507
00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:51.620
it's cut short by sure fatigue and producing these goods,

508
00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:53.800
uh,
for this market.

509
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:57.250
And so these tailors and shoemakers and all of that,

510
00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:01.180
they're in every single movement and they are the ones who first say,
hey,

511
00:32:01.181 --> 00:32:05.470
you know what?
All we workers,
we got some stuff in common and this is,

512
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.140
this is amplified by residential patterns,

513
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:12.200
people living in and around where they work,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
Um,

514
00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.520
and mechanization also give you an example that I do know something about,

515
00:32:15.521 --> 00:32:17.420
which is porcelain.
Uh,
you know,

516
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:22.020
porcelain is one of these products as a luxury good.
Renoir,

517
00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:25.810
the great painter,
he started out,
he was born in Limos,
France in 1841.

518
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.070
[inaudible] he starts out painting plates,
he paints plates.

519
00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:35.440
Now along comes this new,
uh,
uh,
technological innovation.

520
00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:39.560
You know,
how you,
if you,
if you did,
and I only did very briefly,
I make,
you know,

521
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.900
those model airplanes and stuff like that.

522
00:32:41.901 --> 00:32:44.000
And there was a little decals that you'd stick on the,

523
00:32:44.001 --> 00:32:48.920
on the plane to represent the Spitfire or whatever,
American fighters,
boats.

524
00:32:48.921 --> 00:32:53.180
I'm not federal war guy.
Uh,
I stopped that pretty,
uh,
pretty quick.
Um,

525
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.750
and so,
um,
somebody in advanced,
one of these things,
these,

526
00:32:56.751 --> 00:32:58.740
these decals that can be baked on,

527
00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:01.970
on the high quality plates between the first and second baking,

528
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:06.980
porcelain remains an a,
a luxury good.
And the people,

529
00:33:06.981 --> 00:33:11.030
it used to paint them or sent to the warehouse where they work for half or a

530
00:33:11.031 --> 00:33:12.950
third of what they,
not half of her,

531
00:33:12.951 --> 00:33:15.620
about a third of what they would make as skilled painters.

532
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:17.150
They didn't wake up one day,
said,
Jesus,

533
00:33:17.151 --> 00:33:20.360
I can't remember how you paint a plate anymore.
So they said,

534
00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:23.300
no one's going to pay him to paint plates,
except for very special orders.

535
00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:27.200
Glass making.
It's the same thing.
People that,
that,
that made bottles,

536
00:33:27.201 --> 00:33:29.930
that form bottles used to be very well paid.

537
00:33:29.931 --> 00:33:34.700
And then a machine is invented that comes along and,
and,
and does the same thing.

538
00:33:34.701 --> 00:33:39.410
It turns out bottles by the zillions to be filled with wine and whatever.

539
00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:44.450
Uh,
and,
uh,
so they're out of luck.
You know,
the,
as they mad,
they're furious,

540
00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:47.450
and pretty soon they start thinking,
you know,
these unskilled people,

541
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:52.280
we have some of the same grievances and they begin seeing themselves as a class

542
00:33:52.281 --> 00:33:56.380
apart.
So class consciousness isn't sort of an adventure of,

543
00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:00.650
of lefties from the 1970s,
like your,
yours truly,

544
00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:05.150
it's not at all.
I mean,
it was a reality.
It wasn't for everybody,
but,
but I mean,

545
00:34:05.151 --> 00:34:08.280
if you read a lot of the literature,
especially from,
from,
uh,
you know,

546
00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:11.840
from London or from anywhere about the kinds of solidarities that people had

547
00:34:11.841 --> 00:34:16.460
because of the social class and the sense that they formed a class apart,

548
00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:19.400
uh,
and we're,
we're relegated to sort of,

549
00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:24.460
or permanent proletarian status by forces that they can't control the state and

550
00:34:25.011 --> 00:34:28.760
big money and big capital when people be a little better off.

551
00:34:28.761 --> 00:34:33.170
They are thinking about that now.
But anyway,
that,
that,
that's,
that's,
that's that.

552
00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:35.180
Um,
now having said that,

553
00:34:35.181 --> 00:34:39.170
I want to turn in the last 10 minutes to get all that in.

554
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:43.890
Yes.
I want to turn to,
um,
to,
uh,
uh,

555
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:48.200
uh,
something that complements that.
And that is a discussion of,

556
00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:52.410
of industrial discipline.
Because one thing is as,

557
00:34:52.411 --> 00:34:56.610
as workers strike,
as workers learn to strike,
uh,
you know,

558
00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.560
going on,
uh,
to,
um,

559
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:04.970
strike for better working conditions,
uh,
for more money,
uh,

560
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.990
for better hours,
shorter hours,
it's Cetera,
et cetera.
Uh,

561
00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:14.180
one has to imagine,
you know,
what the world looked like from them.

562
00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:18.110
What did they think about things that were happening to them?

563
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:24.010
And one of the things that had happened to them was this sort of 19th century

564
00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.360
end,
uh,

565
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:30.550
stage of the industrial revolution that is factory production.

566
00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:36.770
Now,
if you were an artisan,
if you were a Taylor or I keep using these,

567
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:41.180
but are they're so stuck in my mind are artists and a tailor or shoemaker,

568
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:44.180
you know,
you,
you basically worked,
you know,
when you wanted,

569
00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:49.250
you work in response to I in response to a demand for your product.

570
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:52.350
Uh,

571
00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:57.180
many of these people were on the move going from one place to the next.
But,

572
00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:00.360
but you worked kind of,
uh,
uh,
when you,
when you,

573
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.510
when you wanted to or when there was a demand for your product.

574
00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:08.610
If you were in domestic industry and you're a woman working in the hinterland

575
00:36:08.611 --> 00:36:11.700
of,
uh,
of,
uh,
uh,
Zurich,
uh,

576
00:36:11.701 --> 00:36:15.120
you worked when there was demand for your work and then you took time off to

577
00:36:15.121 --> 00:36:19.380
nurse your child,
uh,
or to take account of the family.
Uh,

578
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:23.400
see how we were doing.
If there was enough to tide through until the next week,

579
00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.160
uh,
you more or less worked on your own.

580
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:31.290
Now a pottery baron called Josiah Wedgwood,

581
00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:36.210
you've probably heard of Wedgewood pottery.
He says just before 1800.

582
00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:40.740
He says,
he's trying to think about how you make all these workers that he has.

583
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:45.600
How do you make them respond in the very same way so they don't just kind of get

584
00:36:45.601 --> 00:36:49.830
up and wander off or spend time talking or enjoying themselves?

585
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:55.100
How do you get them all to work at his single command and his dream,

586
00:36:55.531 --> 00:37:00.531
his fantasy was that he wanted a set of workers that responded as singers on two

587
00:37:02.521 --> 00:37:05.970
hands in response to his commands.

588
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:07.890
That's what he wants.

589
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:13.550
And he and his successors Caray strategies of doing just that.

590
00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:21.360
And in doing so,
they launched this sort of protracted struggle,

591
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:26.630
which is very revealing about the bigger processes at play in the 19th century.

592
00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:32.840
And factories have a lot to do with that.

593
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:36.170
I guess you know,
here,
here too,

594
00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:40.980
when I say that with such intensity for my bad experiences working in factories,

595
00:37:40.981 --> 00:37:45.960
I once,
uh,
I was working in Alice loves jams and jellies and they come up,

596
00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:48.990
come to work about supposed to be there at six in the morning after

597
00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:52.440
a night I probably shouldn't have had.

598
00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.460
And the last thing I remember was the guy,

599
00:37:56.461 --> 00:37:58.950
and he didn't like me because I was a college guy.
He say,

600
00:37:58.951 --> 00:38:01.800
I always said my mighty maize and Blue Michigan shirt on.
And he said,

601
00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:06.300
listen to idiot.
The last that I was on jams and jellies,

602
00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.880
Jelly duty is there's a huge machine,

603
00:38:08.881 --> 00:38:12.060
like you have to imagine an enormous accordion and enormous accordion.

604
00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:16.950
And they'd put all these berries in there and then the press would squeeze them

605
00:38:16.951 --> 00:38:21.090
into Jelly,
which we would,
we would drink or eat and make ourselves Everly sick.

606
00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:25.110
And there were a lot of pressure.
And the last thing I remember him saying was,

607
00:38:25.111 --> 00:38:27.650
listen to idiot.
Don't leave your,
that was me.

608
00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:31.050
Don't leave your finger on that button.
Very Long.

609
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:35.500
And as I was trying to figure out,
you know,
who had beaten who the night before,

610
00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:39.640
and the American league in the thing blew up and this enormous tidal wave of

611
00:38:39.641 --> 00:38:44.020
boys and berry juice engulfed me.
And I was burned,
actually.
I was out of,

612
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:47.380
I was out,
uh,
uh,
I was on sick leave for two weeks,

613
00:38:47.381 --> 00:38:51.430
or it's just done playing basketball and getting paid to do that.
And it,

614
00:38:51.431 --> 00:38:54.250
this tidal wave of boysenberries,
uh,
uh,

615
00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:58.870
a forklift with about something like 2000 jars of apple butter spun out of

616
00:38:58.871 --> 00:39:01.090
control.
And it was a terrible,
terrible mess.

617
00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:05.380
But the point of this is that I hated the foreman and that factory.

618
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:09.340
And as I left,
I said,
well,
too bad for you,
for him.
And I didn't have,

619
00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:12.850
I think that about it.
So anyway,
uh,
anyway,

620
00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:16.810
the point of this is that factories become,
first of all,

621
00:39:16.811 --> 00:39:18.670
a way of maintaining industrial discipline.

622
00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.610
And that in the first factories in Britain,

623
00:39:21.611 --> 00:39:25.510
they were not there because you had these machines that were there,
uh,

624
00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:28.860
immediately.
James Watts,
uh,
you know,
a steam engine was,

625
00:39:28.861 --> 00:39:32.620
was not used for really about 15 years after it was made.
Uh,

626
00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:34.390
because there were many things it could do.

627
00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:39.160
The first factories were there putting together artisans,
semi-skilled workers,

628
00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:44.220
and unskilled workers as a form of industrial discipline.

629
00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:48.310
And when you think,
if you see postcards,
you know,
at the end of the 19th century,

630
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:49.570
but in 1900,

631
00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:53.680
the craze for postcards begins in Europe and in the United States too.

632
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:57.640
And now these postcards are extremely expensive.
If they have people in them,

633
00:39:57.641 --> 00:40:00.550
particularly people at work,
I mean they call it,
they're really,
really,

634
00:40:00.551 --> 00:40:03.130
and I have all sorts of from,
from,
uh,
from the motion,

635
00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:07.060
the portion in industry and from the strikes.
But if you see these pictures,

636
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.910
when workers had their pictures taken together,

637
00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:14.770
they are always in front of the door.
Uh,
and because why?

638
00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:18.170
You had to enter the door or leave the door,
uh,
uh,

639
00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:22.750
that the signal was given by the clock and by the bell that called you to work.

640
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:26.230
And if you were late,
well,
too bad for you,
you could be doctor or fired in there.

641
00:40:26.231 --> 00:40:29.230
Lots more people out there who would like to have those jobs.

642
00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:34.220
And so what happens in the 19th century is that,
is that the factory,
you know,

643
00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.790
before really it's,
it's,
it's uh,
um,

644
00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:42.960
it's role as a houser of big fund during machines in many places.

645
00:40:44.141 --> 00:40:47.770
The factory was first and foremost a way of,
of,
uh,

646
00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.820
putting discipline on workers.
There's a whole terrible case in Brooklyn,

647
00:40:51.821 --> 00:40:53.500
I think in 1912 or something.

648
00:40:53.501 --> 00:40:58.060
We're 150 or 200 women were burned to death because they had locked the Po.

649
00:40:58.090 --> 00:40:59.470
The bosses had the formative,

650
00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:02.320
locked the doors so they couldn't go out and quote unquote chatter.

651
00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.190
And so what they began to do in the middle of the 19th centuries have rules,

652
00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:10.240
regulations for work.
What you can do,
you can't talk,
which,

653
00:41:10.241 --> 00:41:12.100
and when she can't do what you must do.

654
00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.240
And if you were a porcelain worker and you,
and something blew up in the oven,

655
00:41:16.241 --> 00:41:21.130
well that was docked from,
from your salary.
And so,
uh,
in order to,

656
00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:25.270
you know,
to watch over these workers,

657
00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:29.800
they bring in the foreman for people to it because there was a strike in the

658
00:41:29.801 --> 00:41:33.350
most because the,
uh,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the format,

659
00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:37.640
the foreperson who a woman was very religious and she made the workers kneel

660
00:41:37.641 --> 00:41:38.451
down on the,
on the,

661
00:41:38.451 --> 00:41:42.230
on the ground and pray on the stone with her knees on the stolen before work

662
00:41:42.231 --> 00:41:46.670
started.
Uh,
no separation of church and,
and work there.

663
00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:51.520
And so they bring in foreman who are going to enforce these,
uh,

664
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:53.600
to see if what you're a good worker,
if you're a bad worker.

665
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:58.100
Now workers are present this very much.
Um,
how did workers view the bosses?

666
00:41:58.101 --> 00:42:02.510
For example,
in the 1820 [inaudible] and 1830s,
they tended to,
you know,

667
00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:05.660
you're still working in smaller units of production and most places in Europe,

668
00:42:05.661 --> 00:42:09.020
if you're in a factory and you see the,
you know,
you got an issue with the boss,

669
00:42:09.021 --> 00:42:11.600
the boss is somebody who might give you a little extra on Christmas or something

670
00:42:11.601 --> 00:42:16.370
like that.
Um,
you get the boss is somebody you knew and,
and there was a sense of,

671
00:42:16.371 --> 00:42:17.990
well,
you know,
you're not doing me right now.

672
00:42:17.991 --> 00:42:21.530
This isn't right and I'm going to leave to till you get it together to do better

673
00:42:21.531 --> 00:42:23.750
by me to boss is a presence.
Uh,

674
00:42:23.751 --> 00:42:28.520
he's there all the time as my boss and Dennis uniform manufacturer company also

675
00:42:28.521 --> 00:42:32.240
in Portland,
Oregon.
Uh,
you know,
he was there all the,
all the time.

676
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:34.610
By the time the foreman start coming in,

677
00:42:34.611 --> 00:42:37.390
it's a foreman is representing the boss and the foreman has somebody who's

678
00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:42.050
brought in from the outside or promoted often unjustly from within.

679
00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:47.420
And the foreman replaces the boss as the one who was hitting on the young female

680
00:42:47.421 --> 00:42:52.100
workers,
what they call them,
French,
the Dwight Acree sash that's rather crude.

681
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:55.410
Uh,
the,
you know,
the right of hitting on,
uh,

682
00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:59.860
the Eh and s scoring with,
uh,
or,
uh,

683
00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:04.900
putting oneself in a power relationship with,
with,
uh,
you know,
with,
uh,
uh,

684
00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:09.650
a female employee.
So the foreman begins to represent the boss and the boss.

685
00:43:09.651 --> 00:43:13.430
Now during strikes,
the language of workers during strikes is,
you know,
the boss,

686
00:43:13.431 --> 00:43:17.990
he's a,
he's a latch.
Uh,
he's a drunk.
He eats too much.

687
00:43:17.991 --> 00:43:19.280
He doesn't care whether they live or die.

688
00:43:19.281 --> 00:43:21.380
He's still somebody you see kind of walking through,

689
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:24.410
walking through and all that.
You don't like him that much,
but,
but you know,

690
00:43:24.411 --> 00:43:28.250
he's still a presence.
The strikes at the end of the 19th century are very,

691
00:43:28.251 --> 00:43:31.040
very different.
The boss often is,
he's a very distant person.

692
00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:35.650
He's sending telegrams from London or sending telegrams from Fox effort,
uh,

693
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:39.170
to his foreman,
uh,
uh,
uh,
demanding,

694
00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:43.860
demanding this or that.
Uh,
in the case of a strike and Limos,
France,
the,
uh,
the,

695
00:43:43.861 --> 00:43:47.750
the owner of the factory was an American called David [inaudible] Havilland as

696
00:43:47.751 --> 00:43:49.310
an Havilland porcelain.
Uh,

697
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:54.030
one point actually demands that the u s embassy send in the US Marines,
uh,
to,
uh,

698
00:43:54.031 --> 00:43:57.020
it was,
if that was possible in order to put an end to this disturbance,

699
00:43:57.021 --> 00:44:01.690
this disorder in his factory,
he has become,
or she,

700
00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:06.800
a symbol of capitalism protected by the state and protected by the army.

701
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:12.200
This is the,
this is how workers,
not all workers,

702
00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:16.030
but in many cases view the boss view.

703
00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:20.870
The boss industrial discipline has been,
uh,

704
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:25.280
has been imposed by these rules,
these regulations,

705
00:44:25.281 --> 00:44:29.330
these foremen.
And if you don't like it,
too bad,

706
00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:30.710
you can't.

707
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:34.410
Women workers are no longer allowed to go to nurse their children to bring their

708
00:44:34.411 --> 00:44:38.820
children in,
or it could go out and nurse them.
Uh,
they are forced to eat,

709
00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:41.940
you know,
inside the factory.
Uh,
and if you were,

710
00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.700
that's why tuberculosis rates are just enormous.

711
00:44:44.701 --> 00:44:48.250
All particularly in mining and in,
in factories.
I mean,
all the kind of adult,

712
00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:52.560
you'll see this in Germany.
Unal it's really kind of amazing book.
Um,

713
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:55.270
so this is the view of,
of,

714
00:44:55.271 --> 00:45:00.210
of workers of their bosses tells you something about this long process,

715
00:45:00.211 --> 00:45:04.790
very uneven and not everywhere,
but still there.
Uh,
uh,

716
00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.270
that explained this massive kind of,
uh,
uh,

717
00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:11.700
movements of strikes that you found in all sorts of countries in northern Italy,

718
00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:16.470
uh,
in Barcelona,
uh,
in,
in Moscow,
in Moscow,

719
00:45:16.471 --> 00:45:18.690
the of 1917,
uh,

720
00:45:18.691 --> 00:45:23.520
this huge strikes and it would be terribly important in 1917 in Moscow.

721
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.360
And then,
then something else happens.
And I'm going to end with this because I,

722
00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:33.170
it's a minorly in a minor way.
Amazing Tale about,
about,
uh,
a colleague,
uh,
uh,

723
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:33.720
brilliant.

724
00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:36.780
A woman I know called Michelle [inaudible] Ho I something that she wrote in the

725
00:45:36.781 --> 00:45:41.781
late 1970s that it's just still tells you so much about our time in the

726
00:45:42.151 --> 00:45:45.080
beginning of the 20th century in American engineer called Taylor,

727
00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:47.730
g a y l o r comes up,

728
00:45:47.731 --> 00:45:50.160
remember this is time of the Olympics have started up again.

729
00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:51.690
You measure how people,

730
00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:55.590
how fast people can run the hundred or how far they can store the shot.
Put,

731
00:45:55.591 --> 00:45:59.400
you're measuring things,
you're measuring things.
The car races have a gun,

732
00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:02.040
the Po Po,
he Luby bicycle race,

733
00:46:02.041 --> 00:46:06.060
which was a bloody spectacle with bikes careening out of control all the time.

734
00:46:06.061 --> 00:46:09.840
And he's,
you know,
working class heroes getting just mangled,
uh,

735
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:14.100
in part through each other's manipulations of,
of uh,
trying to knock them off.

736
00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.750
But you,
you're measuring things.

737
00:46:15.751 --> 00:46:19.230
And so Taylor comes up with this way of measuring units of production.

738
00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:23.430
The ultimate in industrial discipline.
You are on the assembly line.

739
00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:26.970
They will count the number of units you can do,
um,
of,
of,
uh,

740
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:29.760
jars of apple butter that you can turn out.

741
00:46:29.761 --> 00:46:33.900
And if you're not turning out enough SIA,
we'll get somebody else.

742
00:46:33.901 --> 00:46:36.090
There are a lot of people want that job.
We'll see you.

743
00:46:36.091 --> 00:46:37.290
That's why they wait to stay down.

744
00:46:37.291 --> 00:46:40.530
Cause there are a lot of people want those jobs because of the growth now.

745
00:46:40.531 --> 00:46:45.531
And he becomes the darling of the French car manufacturers.

746
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:50.550
Just that end of four,
it becomes the Darlin.
He is a hot item.
Uh,

747
00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:53.800
he would be on people magazine if they did have one,
uh,

748
00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:58.850
because he comes and tells them how they can get more effort out of their tired,

749
00:46:59.221 --> 00:47:02.100
fatigued workers by counting them.
And it just

750
00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.900
like that all the way.
And Michelle Hole,

751
00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:10.410
when she wrote a brilliant article that an edited book I did a long time ago,

752
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:11.760
her book was called,

753
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:14.250
their article was called the three ages of industrial discipline.

754
00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:19.590
And she had an amazing phrase for the late 1970s.
This is before,
thank God,

755
00:47:19.591 --> 00:47:23.460
cell phones.
And it was before,
uh,
you know,
computers,

756
00:47:23.461 --> 00:47:26.070
personal computers and all of that.
There were computers,

757
00:47:26.071 --> 00:47:28.200
but they weren't personal computers.
Uh,

758
00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:33.350
she said that in this post industrial age where you've got the rust belt and

759
00:47:34.961 --> 00:47:38.200
you've got factories being torn down outside Detroit and in Flint,

760
00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:42.610
in Torrington and water brain,
places like that,
and any Pittsburgh,

761
00:47:42.611 --> 00:47:46.990
and almost anywhere you can name that was the heart of the American industrial

762
00:47:46.991 --> 00:47:47.920
experience.

763
00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:53.310
She predicted in 1978 that what would replace Tara Taylorism would be the

764
00:47:54.641 --> 00:47:58.510
computer that's the computer will measure in your cubicles,

765
00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:03.300
your performance.
And she said in the end,
the,
the,

766
00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:08.310
the foreman would be replaced by the quiet violence of a computer.

767
00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:12.970
Kind of amazing.
See,
on Wednesday.
