WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.290
I assume you saw a triumph of the will?

2
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.270
I think I mentioned other day Leni Riefenstahl only died about four years ago,

3
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.170
uh,

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.550
at age 102.

5
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.290
And she did interviews.

6
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.213
Uh,

7
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.791
I,

8
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:19.791
and just look back on that regime is that she was a professional and,

9
00:00:21.061 --> 00:00:21.720
uh,

10
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.230
she did,

11
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.610
she did a good job in her,

12
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.240
her employers in this case out off Hitler were pleased with their work.

13
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.020
Uh,

14
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.280
what's interesting about the film,

15
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:30.720
among the many things,

16
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.300
and some of the themes I'll touch on and you're reading about I,

17
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.670
is that,

18
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.831
I mean,

19
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:34.921
it's,

20
00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:35.770
it's a combination of,

21
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.680
of the kind of medieval and they're very modern.

22
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:38.040
I mean,

23
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.490
Hitler,

24
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.420
Mussolini used use modern technology,

25
00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:43.080
uh,

26
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.550
Germans who could barely afford to eat,

27
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:46.910
had radios and listened to the speeches of the funeral.

28
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.300
And it was the same thing in,

29
00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:49.090
in,

30
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.440
uh,

31
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.240
in Italy with Mussolini.

32
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.143
Uh,

33
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.450
and a while you saw the images of,

34
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:57.090
of kind of a medieval and Nuremberg,

35
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.490
which was of course no longer exists,

36
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.960
medieval Nuremberg or not much of it.

37
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.340
Uh,

38
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.560
and,

39
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.760
and the kind of modern,

40
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.600
uh,

41
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.220
modern technology of the whole thing.

42
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:05.401
I mean,

43
00:01:05.401 --> 00:01:05.641
Hitler,

44
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:07.350
Hitler liked airplanes.

45
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:08.670
He liked to fly around and,

46
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:08.821
and,

47
00:01:08.821 --> 00:01:09.031
and,

48
00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:10.740
and for all of the kinds of images of the,

49
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.480
of the German warriors,

50
00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:13.410
kind of a medieval,

51
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.800
medieval person who dies diving in a frozen Pomeranian ponds and things like

52
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:19.770
that,

53
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.360
uh,

54
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.520
you know,

55
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.390
with the terrifying we modern is of course apparent too.

56
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:24.571
And,

57
00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:24.840
and,

58
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.560
uh,

59
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.560
and if you want it,

60
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.940
the most chilling example of the modern,

61
00:01:28.941 --> 00:01:29.774
of course it would be the,

62
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.320
the assembly line,

63
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:32.910
the transformation of the assembly line,

64
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.781
uh,

65
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:34.650
into,

66
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.920
uh,

67
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.820
into mass murder,

68
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.510
uh,

69
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.470
the assembly line.

70
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.950
Um,

71
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.783
uh,

72
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.900
um,

73
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.340
uh,

74
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.551
in the,

75
00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:43.680
in the death camps if you've been anyone here,

76
00:01:43.681 --> 00:01:47.210
but nostra it's been to us with a deductible also a long,

77
00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:48.044
long time ago.

78
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.893
But to Auschwitz,

79
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.490
I fairly recently,

80
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.400
one of the most chilling things about Auschwitz actually.

81
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.030
I mean,

82
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.440
the,

83
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.273
it just,

84
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.860
it's just beyond anything,

85
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.720
but it's the commandant's house because the commandant's house has little swings

86
00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:04.590
out behind it.

87
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.450
And that's where the commandant lived.

88
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:08.820
And his wife said this was the happiest time of their lives.

89
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:12.270
And so the little children were playing in them in the garden.

90
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.920
Uh,

91
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.320
on the swings a and there's a big wall there,

92
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:17.550
but not a huge wall.

93
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.420
And the crematoriums are on the other side in that part.

94
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:21.751
That said,

95
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:23.280
I'll Schmidt's not in Birkenau,

96
00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:25.380
which was a couple of kilometers away.

97
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.130
And that life went on in that way as this sort of assembly line.

98
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.143
Uh,

99
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.043
uh,

100
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.440
mass mass murderers of millions and millions of,

101
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.311
uh,

102
00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:36.270
of people.

103
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.640
Uh,

104
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.970
they're a Hungarian Jews,

105
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:39.620
outnumbered.

106
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.453
Um,

107
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.420
a Polish shoes exterminated.

108
00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:43.530
Auschwitz just barely.

109
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.060
That's because at the end of the war,

110
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.310
the Hungarians were,

111
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:48.780
were sending just huge trainloads of people to,

112
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.160
to be exterminated there.

113
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.240
Anyway.

114
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.870
Um,

115
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:52.471
so,

116
00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:52.771
uh,

117
00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:57.210
I want today to talk about off Hitler and I will bring in to this,

118
00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.640
you know,

119
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.740
that some of the themes that you're about,

120
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.400
uh,

121
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.000
um,

122
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.140
but just two things at the beginning,

123
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:06.640
obviously national socialism was one variant,

124
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.713
uh,

125
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.550
certainly the most horrible variant of,

126
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.520
of fascism.

127
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.320
And you can put a Franco into that mix,

128
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.071
but they're,

129
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:18.970
it's authoritarian,

130
00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:20.380
right wing authoritarian rule.

131
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.430
Um,

132
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.940
and that,

133
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.420
that,

134
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.661
uh,

135
00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:23.471
as you know,

136
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:24.304
it was everywhere.

137
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.263
And secondly,

138
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.721
uh,

139
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:27.370
that like world war one,

140
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:27.581
I mean,

141
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:28.690
there's no other period of history,

142
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.310
this great literature,

143
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:31.420
at least in English,

144
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.230
uh,

145
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.891
about it.

146
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:33.221
And,

147
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:35.500
and they're a wonderful trilogy by,

148
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:35.740
uh,

149
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.730
Richard Evans,

150
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.960
um,

151
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.250
Hitler and the Nazis to 1933.

152
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.870
Then second volume was 1933 to the war two.

153
00:03:44.871 --> 00:03:48.340
It's September 1st 39 and the third is 39 to,

154
00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:48.810
um,

155
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.360
uh,

156
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.931
to the end,

157
00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:50.764
to the bunker.

158
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.670
Um,

159
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.503
and also,

160
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.751
uh,

161
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:53.970
there are many biographies of,

162
00:03:53.971 --> 00:03:54.550
of Hitler.

163
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.920
I read,

164
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.210
uh,

165
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.871
about three of them,

166
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:56.980
but the best by far is,

167
00:03:56.981 --> 00:03:57.430
uh,

168
00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.510
Ian Kershaw's,

169
00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.260
uh,

170
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.210
two volumes very long.

171
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.540
But,

172
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.050
uh,

173
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.870
and I'll be drawing on that in part.

174
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.651
So,

175
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:06.460
um,

176
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.600
let's get going,

177
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.473
uh,

178
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.460
on that.

179
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:10.683
Um,

180
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.490
there's a,

181
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.211
there's a picture,

182
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.080
there's a photo.

183
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.640
It's not in the book.

184
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.690
Um,

185
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.610
but there's a photo of Hitler reviewing his,

186
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:19.510
his guys.

187
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.010
Um,

188
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.930
and that particular photo,

189
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:24.940
which was taken about 1927,

190
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.530
it was,

191
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.363
it was not from Amazon,

192
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.640
a huge field.

193
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:28.051
And you,

194
00:04:28.051 --> 00:04:30.550
so you see Hitler reviewing his guys there.

195
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.270
Uh,

196
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.900
but what people don't realize is that picture was taken from a huge,

197
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.690
you know,

198
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.080
there's lots of other people out there,

199
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.230
a little groups like the Nazis might deliver than the law earlier.

200
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.961
And they,

201
00:04:41.961 --> 00:04:42.130
uh,

202
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.390
they too have their leader,

203
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:43.890
their fear,

204
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.320
her and Hitler ends up the National Socialists ends up end up,

205
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.950
you know,

206
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:48.551
ended up winning,

207
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:49.840
but they weren't the only group.

208
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.560
Uh,

209
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.191
and you know,

210
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:52.630
I'm not a believer in the great person,

211
00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:53.380
quote unquote,

212
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.531
uh,

213
00:04:53.531 --> 00:04:54.160
in,

214
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.371
uh,

215
00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:55.300
in history.

216
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.631
I mean,

217
00:04:55.631 --> 00:05:00.631
Hitler did not make the Nazis a world war one created the Nazis.

218
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.020
A lot of the racism,

219
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:02.840
a lot of the,

220
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.130
this,

221
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.360
the idea of hygienic,

222
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.861
pure racial,

223
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:07.690
pure for gay purification and all that.

224
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.021
I mean,

225
00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:09.690
that was all out there as you know.

226
00:05:09.691 --> 00:05:09.781
And,

227
00:05:09.781 --> 00:05:10.361
and I've tried to make,

228
00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:11.194
make clear,

229
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.681
uh,

230
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:12.620
but if it would've been a Hitler,

231
00:05:12.621 --> 00:05:13.510
there been somebody else,

232
00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:14.440
and in 1933,

233
00:05:14.441 --> 00:05:15.910
when Hitler becomes chancellor,

234
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.150
when the other rights,

235
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.400
I,

236
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.671
I,

237
00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:19.000
when,

238
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.201
what,

239
00:05:19.201 --> 00:05:19.901
there are many rights,

240
00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:22.000
but when von Poppen says we've got them boxed in,

241
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:24.100
now we can use Hitler for our own,

242
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:24.640
uh,

243
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.161
our own,

244
00:05:25.161 --> 00:05:25.271
uh,

245
00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:25.811
goals.

246
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:26.021
Well,

247
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:26.854
how,

248
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.180
how incredibly,

249
00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:28.441
uh,

250
00:05:28.441 --> 00:05:29.400
I naive,

251
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.840
uh,

252
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.581
that was,

253
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:30.880
but,

254
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.600
uh,

255
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.781
uh,

256
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:35.590
the Nazis and must be seen in the context of World War One.

257
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.700
They must be really be seen in the context of the poisoning of the put political

258
00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:40.534
atmosphere,

259
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.841
uh,

260
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:41.674
between,

261
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.580
between the wars,

262
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.843
um,

263
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.170
in night in 1876 all the ways as she called Guber.

264
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:51.130
Um,

265
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.510
I didn't write it on the board.

266
00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:53.890
I sent this stuff around to today.

267
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:54.550
A lot of it would not,

268
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.951
she can,

269
00:05:54.951 --> 00:05:55.960
Guber is not on it.

270
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.060
The list changed.

271
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.430
Name to alloys.

272
00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.100
Uh,

273
00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.630
Ottawa,

274
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:00.171
you'd say in French.

275
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:00.680
I don't know what you're saying.

276
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.190
Germany.

277
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.023
Hitler.

278
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.043
Um,

279
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.770
eh,

280
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.080
it was a peasant family and lower Australia.

281
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.340
I all over Australia,

282
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.510
lower Austria.

283
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:09.290
Whew.

284
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.310
A bordering on bullying.

285
00:06:10.311 --> 00:06:11.390
I been to Laura Australia.

286
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:12.290
I've been the Lord roster too.

287
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:12.800
But anyway,

288
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.531
bordering on a,

289
00:06:13.531 --> 00:06:14.630
on a Bohemia,

290
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:15.441
thus his,

291
00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:15.741
his,

292
00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:20.060
the families dislike of checks and Hitler's particular dislike of checks.

293
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:21.020
But he just liked everybody,

294
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:21.680
uh,

295
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.550
outside of Germans.

296
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.271
Um,

297
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:24.081
his father was,

298
00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:25.700
was it legitimate in quotes.

299
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.793
Um,

300
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:27.130
uh,

301
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.540
and ended up with the name of his mother's long,

302
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:31.340
deceased wife's father,

303
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.940
uh,

304
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.460
York Hadler,

305
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.453
a Hie,

306
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.821
d,

307
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:35.061
l,

308
00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:35.181
e,

309
00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:35.511
R,

310
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:37.970
which in 1876 became Hitler.

311
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.223
As I said,

312
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.510
there was a rumor even during the 1920s,

313
00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:41.751
that,

314
00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:42.011
that,

315
00:06:42.011 --> 00:06:42.080
uh,

316
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.320
Hitler,

317
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.730
his grandfather was Jewish.

318
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.290
And this,

319
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.100
these rumors circulated in Munich in the 1920s.

320
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.390
Hiller was born in [inaudible] on the border of Germany.

321
00:06:53.391 --> 00:06:53.871
That is the,

322
00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:55.670
the Austrian German border.

323
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:56.271
Uh,

324
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:57.200
and this was,

325
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.860
uh,

326
00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.690
this was important and his obsession with,

327
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:00.050
with,

328
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.650
uh,

329
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.540
with uniting the two countries.

330
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.290
Um,

331
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.690
his father was a customs official,

332
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:06.380
uh,

333
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.880
comfortable kind of lower class,

334
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.630
uh,

335
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:08.811
uh,

336
00:07:08.811 --> 00:07:09.680
existence,

337
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.830
but it was not a happy family and it was a at all.

338
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:14.030
His father was strict,

339
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:15.283
pompous,

340
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.161
proud of his,

341
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:16.431
his,

342
00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:16.700
uh,

343
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.061
his,

344
00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:17.151
uh,

345
00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:18.200
minimal status,

346
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:18.830
uh,

347
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.130
extremely pedantic and,

348
00:07:20.131 --> 00:07:20.331
and,

349
00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:22.010
and had a violent temper.

350
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:22.611
Uh,

351
00:07:22.611 --> 00:07:26.990
he took care of bees with more loving attention that he took care of his family.

352
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.070
Um,

353
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.420
he managed the family,

354
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:29.961
uh,

355
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:31.040
with efficiency,

356
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:31.371
uh,

357
00:07:31.371 --> 00:07:32.810
but without love,

358
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.290
a Hitler's mother as described by in Kershaw as a simple,

359
00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:36.741
modest,

360
00:07:36.741 --> 00:07:37.574
kindly woman,

361
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:38.150
uh,

362
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.961
who went to church.

363
00:07:38.961 --> 00:07:42.200
And was devoted to her two surviving children odd off.

364
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.303
And Paula,

365
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.290
she smothered them with protectiveness out of Hitler,

366
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:48.681
feared,

367
00:07:48.681 --> 00:07:50.000
but did not love his father.

368
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:50.900
But this,

369
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:51.400
uh,

370
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:51.630
you know,

371
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.980
does not explain the murderers result of the whole thing.

372
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.790
Civil servants get moved around a customs people,

373
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.290
and he moved to a,

374
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:01.490
the family moved to Linz,

375
00:08:01.491 --> 00:08:02.810
L I N Z in Austria,

376
00:08:02.811 --> 00:08:04.460
which was a hotbed of antisemitism.

377
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:05.031
Uh,

378
00:08:05.031 --> 00:08:06.320
in 1895,

379
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.900
hiller began his schooling at age six,

380
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:09.320
uh,

381
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.200
he viewed a lens as his hometown,

382
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:13.000
uh,

383
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.720
and in that terribly too,

384
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.250
and to happy early life.

385
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:16.850
Uh,

386
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:17.300
uh,

387
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:17.930
look back,

388
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.790
almost installed your clay upon living in,

389
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:20.624
in Lens,

390
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.750
but he did not pick up his antisemitism.

391
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.190
Inlands uh,

392
00:08:25.191 --> 00:08:27.620
he started a secretary schooling in 1900,

393
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:31.760
but he was unsatisfactory and mass and in natural history,

394
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:32.451
uh,

395
00:08:32.451 --> 00:08:33.950
he didn't like his teachers.

396
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:34.431
Uh,

397
00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:34.721
he,

398
00:08:34.721 --> 00:08:35.120
he,

399
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:35.660
um,

400
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:36.230
was,

401
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.063
uh,

402
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:37.941
in principle,

403
00:08:37.941 --> 00:08:38.571
respectful,

404
00:08:38.571 --> 00:08:38.791
but,

405
00:08:38.791 --> 00:08:41.150
but he thought himself above many of them.

406
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:42.230
Um,

407
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.830
his,

408
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:43.071
uh,

409
00:08:43.071 --> 00:08:44.240
he was badly adjusted.

410
00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:46.130
His father wanted him to be a civil servant.

411
00:08:46.131 --> 00:08:47.540
He wanted him to follow and be,

412
00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:47.720
you know,

413
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.240
the next in line of the Hitler civil servants.

414
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:50.931
Uh,

415
00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:51.530
but,

416
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:51.711
uh,

417
00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:52.161
I'd also,

418
00:08:52.161 --> 00:08:52.701
as you know,

419
00:08:52.701 --> 00:08:53.301
resisted,

420
00:08:53.301 --> 00:08:55.250
he wanted to be an artist.

421
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:55.780
Uh,

422
00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:56.760
and his father said,

423
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.240
you will not be an artist as long as I am living.

424
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:01.523
Um,

425
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:03.360
Lynn's was,

426
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:03.870
uh,

427
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.880
besides being a hotbed of antisemitism,

428
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:10.290
it was a hotbed of German nationalism and not just Austrian German speaking,

429
00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:10.951
nationalism,

430
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:11.880
but German in general.

431
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:12.773
Nationalism.

432
00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:13.530
Um,

433
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.240
his father died in 1903,

434
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:16.200
and then I,

435
00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:16.800
Hitler,

436
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.390
I hit the academic skids.

437
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.890
He failed in math.

438
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:20.730
Uh,

439
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.050
he moved to another school,

440
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:22.710
50.

441
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.500
You're a 50 miles away in a place called [inaudible],

442
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:26.940
but it wasn't any better.

443
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:27.721
Um,

444
00:09:27.721 --> 00:09:30.960
and then he took up this sort of low idle existence.

445
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:31.740
Uh,

446
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.071
uh,

447
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:32.881
and he painted,

448
00:09:32.881 --> 00:09:34.050
he read poetry.

449
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:34.501
Uh,

450
00:09:34.501 --> 00:09:35.850
he attended the theater.

451
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.950
That's was one of his great loves.

452
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:39.150
Um,

453
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.130
in Lynn's a a 1905,

454
00:09:41.131 --> 00:09:42.060
1907,

455
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.460
he had one friend or goosed,

456
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.103
Quba Sec,

457
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:47.041
uh,

458
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:49.410
who was the center of a POLST upholsterer.

459
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.360
And Hitler dominated them.

460
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.700
He needed somebody to listen to him.

461
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:54.601
Uh,

462
00:09:54.601 --> 00:09:55.434
and so,

463
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:56.520
uh,

464
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:56.731
uh,

465
00:09:56.731 --> 00:09:57.570
Cuba Sec,

466
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.433
uh,

467
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:03.470
was exposed and I suppose willingly to Hitler's diatribes is pontification his

468
00:10:04.921 --> 00:10:08.160
monologues about virtually everything.

469
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.920
He was the classic kind of know at all.

470
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.670
He was Pale a sin.

471
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.600
Uh,

472
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.290
um,

473
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:16.831
he had that,

474
00:10:16.831 --> 00:10:18.210
that little mustache,

475
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:18.510
uh,

476
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:19.500
that would become bigger.

477
00:10:19.501 --> 00:10:23.310
He wore a black coat and a dark hat and he carried a black cane with a

478
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:26.340
pretentious ivory ivory handle.

479
00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:27.001
Uh,

480
00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:28.740
his great passion with Wagner,

481
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:29.903
um,

482
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.340
uh,

483
00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.410
who goes to,

484
00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:32.041
we know about music.

485
00:10:32.041 --> 00:10:32.191
No,

486
00:10:32.191 --> 00:10:33.210
the Wagner was a,

487
00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:34.890
it was a rating anti-semite,

488
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:35.970
um,

489
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:36.803
and um,

490
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.690
as well in art as art and architecture,

491
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:40.220
uh,

492
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.900
about what she claimed to know a great deal.

493
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.400
He wanted to begin as artistic career at the academy in Vienna.

494
00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:47.430
Um,

495
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.680
and his mother had fallen ill with cancer.

496
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:50.250
Um,

497
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:50.940
uh,

498
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:51.430
uh,

499
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:52.740
and soon died.

500
00:10:52.741 --> 00:10:54.300
She died in 1907.

501
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.970
This struck him is a bolt out of the blue.

502
00:10:56.971 --> 00:11:01.500
He remembered he applied for the academy and Giana and to his horror,

503
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.360
he was turned down.

504
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:04.591
He went to Vienna.

505
00:11:04.591 --> 00:11:05.250
Anyway,

506
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.480
in February,

507
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:06.481
1908,

508
00:11:06.481 --> 00:11:07.890
hoping to become an architect.

509
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:08.851
Uh,

510
00:11:08.851 --> 00:11:09.810
he said later,

511
00:11:09.811 --> 00:11:13.350
I owe it to that period that I grew hardened.

512
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:14.041
Uh,

513
00:11:14.041 --> 00:11:16.020
he lived in Vienna from 1908,

514
00:11:16.021 --> 00:11:18.360
February until May,

515
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.360
1913 he said later after the war,

516
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:22.260
uh,

517
00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.160
during this political,

518
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.440
a sense that it was during that period,

519
00:11:25.441 --> 00:11:25.801
that quote,

520
00:11:25.801 --> 00:11:29.940
my eyes were opened to the two minuses of which I had previously scarcely known

521
00:11:29.941 --> 00:11:30.774
the word,

522
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:31.530
uh,

523
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:32.160
the names,

524
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.110
Marxism and jewelry,

525
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.093
the Jews,

526
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.330
he,

527
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:36.780
Eh,

528
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.310
and this appears in mind comp.

529
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.300
I,

530
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:40.950
his,

531
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:41.970
my struggle,

532
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:42.601
uh,

533
00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:43.351
which he wrote,

534
00:11:43.351 --> 00:11:43.711
you know,

535
00:11:43.711 --> 00:11:45.150
when he was in London's prison,

536
00:11:45.151 --> 00:11:46.710
I even visited the cell once,

537
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:47.250
uh,

538
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:47.911
after the,

539
00:11:47.911 --> 00:11:49.710
the old faded Beer Hall Pooch,

540
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:50.640
uh,

541
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.001
in,

542
00:11:51.001 --> 00:11:52.860
in Munich in 19,

543
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.441
uh,

544
00:11:53.441 --> 00:11:54.400
23.

545
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:55.270
<v 1>Uh,</v>

546
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.140
but this was out of,

547
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:56.591
uh,

548
00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:57.760
out of retrospect,

549
00:11:57.761 --> 00:12:02.761
there was really no evidence that he had become a raging a anti-semite before

550
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.050
1914.

551
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:05.591
Yet,

552
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:05.771
I mean,

553
00:12:05.771 --> 00:12:06.700
antisemitism was,

554
00:12:06.701 --> 00:12:06.931
was,

555
00:12:06.931 --> 00:12:07.450
was,

556
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.850
was so prevalent in Australia.

557
00:12:09.851 --> 00:12:10.720
And Carl Lugar,

558
00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:11.554
who was the,

559
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.011
uh,

560
00:12:12.011 --> 00:12:12.181
you know,

561
00:12:12.181 --> 00:12:12.821
when the mayor of,

562
00:12:12.821 --> 00:12:13.211
of,

563
00:12:13.211 --> 00:12:13.601
of,

564
00:12:13.601 --> 00:12:14.350
um,

565
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:14.951
uh,

566
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:16.990
of Vienna and whom I mentioned before,

567
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:17.650
uh,

568
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:18.280
was,

569
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:18.521
uh,

570
00:12:18.521 --> 00:12:20.200
one of the worst in that period.

571
00:12:20.201 --> 00:12:20.321
And,

572
00:12:20.321 --> 00:12:20.501
and,

573
00:12:20.501 --> 00:12:21.011
and he,

574
00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:21.340
uh,

575
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.690
given this chilling quote before,

576
00:12:22.691 --> 00:12:23.524
but I'll say it again.

577
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:24.341
He's the one said,

578
00:12:24.341 --> 00:12:25.870
I decide who is a Jew.

579
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.741
Uh,

580
00:12:26.741 --> 00:12:26.961
and,

581
00:12:26.961 --> 00:12:31.510
and the liberalism that had been Vienna in the earlier period was a hardened,

582
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.040
like Hitler became hardened,

583
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:33.730
uh,

584
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:34.900
in to,

585
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:35.710
um,

586
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:35.921
uh,

587
00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:37.120
just a vast,

588
00:12:37.121 --> 00:12:38.500
a vast,

589
00:12:38.501 --> 00:12:39.120
uh,

590
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:39.421
uh,

591
00:12:39.421 --> 00:12:39.630
in,

592
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:40.810
in tolerance.

593
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.520
But at the time he said that,

594
00:12:42.521 --> 00:12:42.730
that,

595
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.320
that these two menaces,

596
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:45.010
uh,

597
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.000
we're known to him,

598
00:12:46.001 --> 00:12:46.900
he was struggling,

599
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:47.800
uh,

600
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.340
uh,

601
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.173
he wanted to be,

602
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.740
to be the man,

603
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:51.340
uh,

604
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:51.581
uh,

605
00:12:51.581 --> 00:12:52.090
you know,

606
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:53.320
in leadership of the German,

607
00:12:53.321 --> 00:12:54.154
right.

608
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.670
And so he was in sang this a,

609
00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.420
if you believe Kershaw and I do on this,

610
00:12:58.690 --> 00:12:59.170
uh,

611
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:00.190
and I'm much more,

612
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.000
uh,

613
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.050
that this was a fabrication are that the Anti Marxists,

614
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:10.320
the Anti Socialist and subsequent anticommunist after 1917 that was there and

615
00:13:10.871 --> 00:13:14.590
his long diatribes in the serve shabby rooming house where they would sit

616
00:13:14.591 --> 00:13:15.041
around.

617
00:13:15.041 --> 00:13:15.731
And finally,

618
00:13:15.731 --> 00:13:19.210
you can imagine one by one people just getting tired of listening to od off and

619
00:13:19.211 --> 00:13:21.730
going up to their miserable little rooms to get some sleep.

620
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.400
We're against the socialist and the,

621
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:24.840
the,

622
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.000
the,

623
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:25.360
the,

624
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.760
the Austrian socialists like the German SPD,

625
00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:28.300
uh,

626
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.760
counterparts had long marches,

627
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:31.430
uh,

628
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.631
uh,

629
00:13:31.631 --> 00:13:34.540
through the streets of Vienna on behalf of workers rights.

630
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:35.110
Uh,

631
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.681
it's Cetera,

632
00:13:35.681 --> 00:13:36.514
et cetera.

633
00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:37.230
And,

634
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.530
and Hitler would stand on the porch of this room,

635
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.511
a house,

636
00:13:40.511 --> 00:13:41.344
and simply hate,

637
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.570
hate them as a,

638
00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:43.483
they went,

639
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.950
uh,

640
00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:44.400
went,

641
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.233
went back,

642
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.113
but went by.

643
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:46.900
Um,

644
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:47.321
but yet,

645
00:13:47.321 --> 00:13:47.561
I mean,

646
00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:50.200
Vianna was a huge melting pot of this,

647
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.970
this enormous empire.

648
00:13:51.971 --> 00:13:56.800
There are all sorts of people besides German speakers who lived in Vienna,

649
00:13:56.801 --> 00:13:58.450
and many of the German speakers,

650
00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:58.980
uh,

651
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.190
were Jews,

652
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.233
uh,

653
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:01.790
uh,

654
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:02.710
Freud among them.

655
00:14:02.711 --> 00:14:02.861
I've,

656
00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:03.940
I've been to Freud's,

657
00:14:03.941 --> 00:14:04.774
uh,

658
00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:05.770
uh,

659
00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.320
almost bizarrely recreated,

660
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:08.950
um,

661
00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:09.783
uh,

662
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:12.390
office there in Vienna,

663
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:13.690
but it had a,

664
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:18.610
a Jewish population was about 2% of the population in 1910.

665
00:14:18.611 --> 00:14:21.010
It was 175,000 people in Vienna or,

666
00:14:21.011 --> 00:14:24.100
but then it grew to 8.6%,

667
00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:24.820
uh,

668
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:25.420
of,

669
00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:25.631
uh,

670
00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:26.800
of the population.

671
00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.660
And later I went in and Hitler speeches,

672
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:33.370
thundering speeches over the top speeches.

673
00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:34.060
Uh,

674
00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:34.680
he,

675
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:35.513
um,

676
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.010
saw them as,

677
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.540
as,

678
00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:38.190
uh,

679
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:38.500
uh,

680
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.281
as Jews,

681
00:14:39.281 --> 00:14:39.521
as,

682
00:14:39.521 --> 00:14:41.350
as capitalists exploiters of,

683
00:14:41.351 --> 00:14:41.710
of,

684
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:42.820
of true Germans,

685
00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:43.660
uh,

686
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.201
et Cetera,

687
00:14:44.201 --> 00:14:45.034
et cetera.

688
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:45.580
Uh,

689
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.031
but this,

690
00:14:46.031 --> 00:14:46.361
this,

691
00:14:46.361 --> 00:14:47.180
this came,

692
00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.013
uh,

693
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.820
came,

694
00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.121
uh,

695
00:14:49.121 --> 00:14:49.954
later,

696
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.913
um,

697
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.730
Luger by the way,

698
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:56.210
anticipated Hitler and lots of other people by saying in,

699
00:14:56.211 --> 00:14:57.021
in 1890,

700
00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:58.580
the quotes that the Jewish problem,

701
00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.630
quote unquote,

702
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:03.980
would be solved if all the Jews were placed on a large ship and sunk at sea.

703
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:05.563
But when,

704
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.490
when Paula went,

705
00:15:06.491 --> 00:15:08.120
when out of Hitler lived with Cuba,

706
00:15:08.121 --> 00:15:08.811
sac in,

707
00:15:08.811 --> 00:15:11.570
in this rooming house and went to the theater,

708
00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:11.930
uh,

709
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:12.763
with him,

710
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.190
uh,

711
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.070
he was not yet thinking of politics.

712
00:15:16.071 --> 00:15:18.290
What he wanted to do was become this famous artist.

713
00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:18.920
And then he,

714
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.650
it is true that he painted postcards for tourists,

715
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:22.220
uh,

716
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.020
which he sold to kind of keep himself,

717
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:25.063
uh,

718
00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:25.390
uh,

719
00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:26.150
float.

720
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.780
Um,

721
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:27.501
Kubitschek was a,

722
00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:28.490
was a piano player.

723
00:15:28.491 --> 00:15:30.380
So the room there was two bads and a piano,

724
00:15:30.381 --> 00:15:31.214
and that was about it.

725
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.640
And so sometimes you can imagine the Kubitschek playing the piano just to try to

726
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:35.803
tune out,

727
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:36.351
odd off.

728
00:15:36.351 --> 00:15:37.210
But he was rather low,

729
00:15:37.211 --> 00:15:38.044
loyal to him.

730
00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:39.260
A Hitler began to,

731
00:15:39.261 --> 00:15:40.100
to write a play.

732
00:15:40.101 --> 00:15:40.880
We went to the theaters,

733
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:41.271
I said,

734
00:15:41.271 --> 00:15:45.080
and he got a little bit of inherited money after his parents died.

735
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.290
He had little interest in women.

736
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.921
And of course,

737
00:15:48.921 --> 00:15:50.390
one of this are prevalent rumors,

738
00:15:50.391 --> 00:15:50.721
is that,

739
00:15:50.721 --> 00:15:51.860
that he was impotent,

740
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:52.700
uh,

741
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:52.881
though,

742
00:15:52.881 --> 00:15:53.130
hit,

743
00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:54.020
as you all know,

744
00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:55.970
surely he would marry Eva Brown,

745
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:56.690
uh,

746
00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:57.261
in the,

747
00:15:57.261 --> 00:15:58.950
in the bunker,

748
00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.150
uh,

749
00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.931
before they,

750
00:15:59.931 --> 00:16:00.590
uh,

751
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:04.170
took cyanide pills and killed themselves as the Russian tanks.

752
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:06.590
Could almost be heard rumbling above.

753
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:07.680
Um,

754
00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.300
Eh,

755
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:08.651
we,

756
00:16:08.651 --> 00:16:10.940
we no have no sexual experience,

757
00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:12.043
um,

758
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:13.490
that he had,

759
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:13.611
uh,

760
00:16:13.611 --> 00:16:16.430
he described the ideal woman that quote as a cute,

761
00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:17.061
cuddly,

762
00:16:17.061 --> 00:16:18.320
naive little thing,

763
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.340
tender,

764
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.810
sweet and stupid.

765
00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:21.640
Uh,

766
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.460
and of course,

767
00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:22.611
uh,

768
00:16:22.611 --> 00:16:23.331
like Moose,

769
00:16:23.331 --> 00:16:24.170
Moose Salini,

770
00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:24.741
who was a,

771
00:16:24.741 --> 00:16:24.981
you know,

772
00:16:24.981 --> 00:16:27.080
notorious a philanderer,

773
00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.360
and he used to brag,

774
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.210
uh,

775
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.370
tirelessly about his sexual exploits.

776
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.060
Uh,

777
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.950
both Hitler and Mussolini believed that women,

778
00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:34.570
uh,

779
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:34.890
uh,

780
00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.170
as place was in the home,

781
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:36.830
uh,

782
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.370
turning out a baby boy soldiers,

783
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.071
uh,

784
00:16:40.071 --> 00:16:40.301
and,

785
00:16:40.301 --> 00:16:40.661
and,

786
00:16:40.661 --> 00:16:41.060
and,

787
00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.560
and not in the factories.

788
00:16:42.561 --> 00:16:42.981
And of course,

789
00:16:42.981 --> 00:16:45.140
when the ironies is during the Second World War,

790
00:16:45.141 --> 00:16:45.321
that,

791
00:16:45.321 --> 00:16:50.030
that women are increasingly doing jobs that Hitler and Mussolini,

792
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.380
I thought were inappropriate,

793
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.741
uh,

794
00:16:51.741 --> 00:16:53.320
simply because the men were,

795
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.233
were dead.

796
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:54.890
Uh,

797
00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:55.251
but,

798
00:16:55.251 --> 00:16:55.700
um,

799
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.001
anyway,

800
00:16:56.001 --> 00:16:57.050
so he was prudish,

801
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.920
um,

802
00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.630
seemingly repelled by sex,

803
00:16:59.631 --> 00:17:01.640
although fascinated a Avaya.

804
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:02.953
Um,

805
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.300
and one of the points that Kershaw makes is that qubit checks,

806
00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:07.850
uh,

807
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:09.640
recollections along with that of,

808
00:17:09.641 --> 00:17:09.910
of,

809
00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:10.400
of,

810
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.560
of Hitler's a a sister Paula,

811
00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:13.430
uh,

812
00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:14.510
give us a sense of,

813
00:17:14.511 --> 00:17:19.190
of some of the things that would remain characteristic of Hitler until his must

814
00:17:19.191 --> 00:17:20.210
deserved end.

815
00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:21.080
Uh,

816
00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.070
basically,

817
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:22.400
uh,

818
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.450
he was lazy,

819
00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:24.740
um,

820
00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:25.490
that,

821
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:25.910
uh,

822
00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:28.130
he was manic at times.

823
00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:31.760
There'd be these bursts of wild enthusiasm for something he would,

824
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:32.320
uh,

825
00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:32.560
uh,

826
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.261
during the war,

827
00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:33.501
he would,

828
00:17:33.501 --> 00:17:37.190
he would demand that the general's place maps in front of him and he would make

829
00:17:37.191 --> 00:17:38.030
the decisions,

830
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:38.810
uh,

831
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:41.300
as the general secretly moaned about,

832
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:41.480
uh,

833
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.600
he consider himself an expert in military affairs as well.

834
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:44.961
Uh,

835
00:17:44.961 --> 00:17:45.351
there was,

836
00:17:45.351 --> 00:17:45.760
uh,

837
00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:46.000
uh,

838
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.990
a pathological sense of reality and,

839
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.441
and,

840
00:17:48.441 --> 00:17:50.460
and a sense of proportion,

841
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:51.300
ah,

842
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.690
and a vindictiveness that,

843
00:17:52.691 --> 00:17:52.960
that,

844
00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.110
uh,

845
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.050
as most of you that followed this at all,

846
00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.190
I would know,

847
00:17:56.191 --> 00:17:57.630
kept the Russian invasion,

848
00:17:57.631 --> 00:18:00.810
stalled it as he punished the Yugoslavs,

849
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:01.740
uh,

850
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:02.160
uh,

851
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.800
poor troops in Yugoslavia to slaughter people.

852
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.220
And then,

853
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:05.650
uh,

854
00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:06.490
I delayed the,

855
00:18:06.491 --> 00:18:07.081
the famous,

856
00:18:07.081 --> 00:18:07.590
uh,

857
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.741
uh,

858
00:18:07.741 --> 00:18:10.410
invasion of the Soviet Union in,

859
00:18:10.411 --> 00:18:10.920
uh,

860
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.340
in,

861
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:11.491
uh,

862
00:18:11.491 --> 00:18:12.570
June 22nd,

863
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:13.430
uh,

864
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.650
uh,

865
00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.590
was 21st I was in Kiev wants and the bells were all ringing.

866
00:18:16.591 --> 00:18:20.750
And I realized that was the same time that the German planes had had first,

867
00:18:20.751 --> 00:18:20.910
uh,

868
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:21.400
uh,

869
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:21.720
uh,

870
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:22.680
first arrived.

871
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:23.750
Um,

872
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:24.420
uh,

873
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.860
but you know,

874
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:26.880
he is intolerance.

875
00:18:26.881 --> 00:18:27.091
His,

876
00:18:27.091 --> 00:18:28.650
his flashes of anger,

877
00:18:28.651 --> 00:18:29.820
his tediousness,

878
00:18:29.821 --> 00:18:30.350
uh,

879
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.810
uh,

880
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:33.180
his sense of predestined greatness.

881
00:18:33.181 --> 00:18:36.210
It was all there in the shabby little room rooming house.

882
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.050
Um,

883
00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:37.621
and,

884
00:18:37.621 --> 00:18:38.454
uh,

885
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.440
the sense of frustration,

886
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:41.071
uh,

887
00:18:41.071 --> 00:18:41.611
that,

888
00:18:41.611 --> 00:18:42.300
uh,

889
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.800
um,

890
00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:46.530
that his genius wasn't recognized as genius,

891
00:18:46.531 --> 00:18:47.550
wasn't recognized,

892
00:18:47.551 --> 00:18:47.790
but,

893
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.820
but there is no evidence of tirades against Jews,

894
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:51.331
uh,

895
00:18:51.331 --> 00:18:52.050
that would,

896
00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:52.600
uh,

897
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:52.980
uh,

898
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:53.730
come,

899
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:54.181
uh,

900
00:18:54.181 --> 00:18:55.020
come later.

901
00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:56.160
Um,

902
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:56.641
a friend,

903
00:18:56.641 --> 00:18:57.570
another friend of his,

904
00:18:57.571 --> 00:18:59.040
a guy called the hunnish,

905
00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:00.173
um,

906
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.261
about whom,

907
00:19:01.261 --> 00:19:02.250
whom I know nothing,

908
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:03.540
um,

909
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.220
said that,

910
00:19:05.221 --> 00:19:05.720
uh,

911
00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.330
this was after Kubitschek had disappeared from Vienna in those days.

912
00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.490
Hitler was by no means a Jew hater.

913
00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.130
He became one afterwards.

914
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:14.611
I,

915
00:19:14.611 --> 00:19:16.200
and in the words of Kershaw,

916
00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:17.101
the first war,

917
00:19:17.101 --> 00:19:21.840
one world war made a made Hitler possible.

918
00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:25.080
And in 1920 he said,

919
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.910
for the first time in print,

920
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.000
Jews are to be exterminated.

921
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:35.510
And this is after the foundation of the German Workers Party in early in 18,

922
00:19:35.701 --> 00:19:36.534
19.

923
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.201
And of course,

924
00:19:37.201 --> 00:19:39.810
it's that party that that would become,

925
00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:40.400
uh,

926
00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.840
that that would become the Nazis.

927
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.830
Now there is a picture that may be doctored,

928
00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:47.401
uh,

929
00:19:47.401 --> 00:19:49.950
and that I apparently is no longer in the second edition.

930
00:19:49.951 --> 00:19:50.371
It should be.

931
00:19:50.371 --> 00:19:53.570
It was in the first edition of the war starting in,

932
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:53.880
in,

933
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.720
in Munich.

934
00:19:54.721 --> 00:19:56.760
And I think I haven't mentioned this before,

935
00:19:56.761 --> 00:19:58.920
and it's a crowd scene and people are,

936
00:19:59.160 --> 00:19:59.600
are,

937
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.121
uh,

938
00:20:00.121 --> 00:20:01.580
I mean the board has been announced the worst,

939
00:20:01.581 --> 00:20:02.221
not in Munich,

940
00:20:02.221 --> 00:20:03.350
but all these people are,

941
00:20:03.351 --> 00:20:04.470
are around the hotel,

942
00:20:04.471 --> 00:20:05.400
do the town hall.

943
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.233
And they're,

944
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:06.691
uh,

945
00:20:06.691 --> 00:20:07.471
just exuberant.

946
00:20:07.471 --> 00:20:09.960
He didn't see the smiling Hitler beaming,

947
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.033
happy,

948
00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:11.963
fulfilled,

949
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:12.301
you know,

950
00:20:12.301 --> 00:20:16.320
he's going to fight for fight for German nationalism.

951
00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.011
Um,

952
00:20:17.011 --> 00:20:18.360
and he did fight in the war.

953
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.130
He was one of the guys.

954
00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:21.360
Um,

955
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:21.871
he would,

956
00:20:21.871 --> 00:20:22.461
he was a,

957
00:20:22.461 --> 00:20:23.880
a comrade because he,

958
00:20:23.881 --> 00:20:25.200
he was wounded twice.

959
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.060
He was a runner in the war.

960
00:20:27.061 --> 00:20:28.320
He carried messages,

961
00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:28.801
uh,

962
00:20:28.801 --> 00:20:29.490
from,

963
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:30.180
uh,

964
00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:30.491
uh,

965
00:20:30.491 --> 00:20:31.890
from officers,

966
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.310
uh,

967
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:33.030
to,

968
00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:33.180
uh,

969
00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:34.080
to the trenches.

970
00:20:34.081 --> 00:20:36.000
And then he literally ran,

971
00:20:36.001 --> 00:20:36.460
but you know,

972
00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.350
kind of carried them,

973
00:20:37.351 --> 00:20:39.060
but they called him a runners.

974
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.600
Um,

975
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.740
and so after the war,

976
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.570
he emerges as,

977
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.320
as the,

978
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.400
as do troops,

979
00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:45.230
uh,

980
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:46.240
demobilized,

981
00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:46.740
uh,

982
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.970
in country facing the challenges of,

983
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.830
of an uncertain future.

984
00:20:50.831 --> 00:20:51.021
And,

985
00:20:51.021 --> 00:20:53.110
and nowhere was that a future,

986
00:20:53.111 --> 00:20:54.820
arguably more uncertain than,

987
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:55.060
uh,

988
00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:55.241
in,

989
00:20:55.241 --> 00:20:56.074
in Germany.

990
00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:57.070
Um,

991
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.311
now,

992
00:20:57.311 --> 00:21:02.311
not all veterans of the fight in the German war cause and World War One,

993
00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:05.650
of course,

994
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:06.790
turn too far right?

995
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:08.170
Policy Politics,

996
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:09.020
uh,

997
00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:09.610
the,

998
00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:10.630
the s pay day,

999
00:21:10.631 --> 00:21:14.020
the socialist veteran's organization was the largest of the mall,

1000
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.920
um,

1001
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:15.550
yet,

1002
00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:15.710
uh,

1003
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:20.710
there are just an enormous continuity's between those German soldiers who

1004
00:21:20.861 --> 00:21:22.480
returned from the war,

1005
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:23.081
uh,

1006
00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:24.280
with their weapons,

1007
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.970
uh,

1008
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:26.230
in their houses.

1009
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:26.651
Uh,

1010
00:21:26.651 --> 00:21:27.940
joining the free core,

1011
00:21:27.941 --> 00:21:28.930
the fry core.

1012
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.530
Uh,

1013
00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:30.580
they kept on marching,

1014
00:21:30.581 --> 00:21:32.650
they kept on training in their basements,

1015
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:33.031
uh,

1016
00:21:33.031 --> 00:21:33.910
and they would,

1017
00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:34.570
uh,

1018
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:34.870
uh,

1019
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:37.900
come back and therefore be exposed to all of these currents.

1020
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:39.460
The sense of betrayal,

1021
00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:40.001
again,

1022
00:21:40.001 --> 00:21:41.050
as I've said before,

1023
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.100
this is the third time.

1024
00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:46.570
But how do you explain to the folks back home that you've lost the war when your

1025
00:21:46.571 --> 00:21:48.460
tubes are way inside of France,

1026
00:21:48.461 --> 00:21:50.380
they're not perched on the frontier.

1027
00:21:50.381 --> 00:21:51.640
There are way inside.

1028
00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:53.680
So it's got to be somebody's fault.

1029
00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:55.780
So whose fault is it?

1030
00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.650
It's the Jews and it's the socialists.

1031
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.233
Um,

1032
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.070
and it's the Weimar republic.

1033
00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:07.330
And so these themes come together and that's a constant theme.

1034
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:08.643
Hitler,

1035
00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.050
Hitler believed.

1036
00:22:11.051 --> 00:22:14.170
If you told people the same lies over and over and over again,

1037
00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:15.071
that,

1038
00:22:15.071 --> 00:22:15.311
that,

1039
00:22:15.311 --> 00:22:15.461
that,

1040
00:22:15.461 --> 00:22:16.360
that they will believe them.

1041
00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.250
It was happens in our country too,

1042
00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:19.481
but in,

1043
00:22:19.481 --> 00:22:20.261
in Hitler's case,

1044
00:22:20.261 --> 00:22:22.960
the lies were even more a pernicious.

1045
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.860
And so the revisionism becomes,

1046
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.620
you know,

1047
00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:32.620
an official policy of all of these right wing groups of all of them.

1048
00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.790
But the thing that's really just incredible is that the people have memories of

1049
00:22:36.791 --> 00:22:37.624
Hitler.

1050
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:39.280
And when you see pictures of them,

1051
00:22:39.281 --> 00:22:40.570
this kind of pulling the teeth,

1052
00:22:40.571 --> 00:22:41.500
I guess you'd say in French,

1053
00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:41.891
you know,

1054
00:22:41.891 --> 00:22:43.060
a sad sack,

1055
00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:44.650
uh,

1056
00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:44.861
you know,

1057
00:22:44.861 --> 00:22:46.820
wearing ill fitting clothes and,

1058
00:22:46.821 --> 00:22:47.150
and,

1059
00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:47.820
and,

1060
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.370
uh,

1061
00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:48.850
uh,

1062
00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:50.320
did not have friends.

1063
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:51.970
Kubitschek had disappeared.

1064
00:22:51.971 --> 00:22:52.810
I had no idea where he,

1065
00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:53.830
uh,

1066
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:54.030
uh,

1067
00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:55.150
what happened to him.

1068
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.273
Um,

1069
00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:00.370
and who had big hope from self that could never possibly fulfilled.

1070
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.320
And the idea of this,

1071
00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:04.720
those of you who have a partied in Munich,

1072
00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:05.321
you know,

1073
00:23:05.321 --> 00:23:07.510
on the tour or something like that,

1074
00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.670
and I partied in Munich,

1075
00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:11.950
but 20 years old,

1076
00:23:11.951 --> 00:23:13.320
we went to these places and,

1077
00:23:13.321 --> 00:23:14.154
and uh,

1078
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.040
uh,

1079
00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:15.370
but,

1080
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:18.490
but you remember when you go into these big places like the Hofbrau House,

1081
00:23:18.491 --> 00:23:21.280
which is one of the worst and these other places,

1082
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.210
uh,

1083
00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:23.710
it is hard to imagine.

1084
00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:23.951
I mean,

1085
00:23:23.951 --> 00:23:27.100
this is where the right wing groups map that all of a sudden this,

1086
00:23:27.101 --> 00:23:32.101
this is kind of sad sack guy could jump or be lifted on a table.

1087
00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:38.040
He wasn't terribly athletic and suddenly have people listening to every word

1088
00:23:39.611 --> 00:23:42.820
that he said for hours,

1089
00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:44.260
for hours.

1090
00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.290
And those speeches,

1091
00:23:45.291 --> 00:23:46.130
have you ever heard,

1092
00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:46.691
you know,

1093
00:23:46.691 --> 00:23:47.800
his speeches,

1094
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:50.090
if you're German is really good and mine is terrible,

1095
00:23:50.091 --> 00:23:51.140
I'd barely exists.

1096
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:52.060
Uh,

1097
00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:56.060
if people would listen on the radio and he would build up with this,

1098
00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:57.200
just this,

1099
00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:02.200
this crescendo denouncing the will to power my struggle,

1100
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.150
our struggle,

1101
00:24:05.151 --> 00:24:06.710
the German people struggle.

1102
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.330
Those who have destroyed us,

1103
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:10.610
those who signed on the dotted line,

1104
00:24:10.611 --> 00:24:14.300
the war guilt clause that said that Germany started at all,

1105
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.160
we will get them back.

1106
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.660
He says in 1925 when my mind conference published in 25,

1107
00:24:20.661 --> 00:24:21.620
we think is 25,

1108
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:22.640
he says,

1109
00:24:22.641 --> 00:24:23.900
we will kill the Jews.

1110
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:25.281
He says,

1111
00:24:25.281 --> 00:24:30.281
we'll expand elbow room living space that we will expand to the east.

1112
00:24:31.371 --> 00:24:32.510
He says this,

1113
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.770
you could buy copies of,

1114
00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.130
of mine confident in,

1115
00:24:35.131 --> 00:24:36.260
in Manhattan.

1116
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:37.110
You could buy,

1117
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.210
you buy copies of it in,

1118
00:24:38.211 --> 00:24:38.471
in,

1119
00:24:38.471 --> 00:24:39.560
in a Melbourne.

1120
00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:41.960
You could buy copies of it anywhere was transfer,

1121
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.720
translate in,

1122
00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.660
in a variety of languages.

1123
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.360
And it was all there from the beginning.

1124
00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:52.880
And the consistency in what Hitler was telling,

1125
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:54.170
uh,

1126
00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:55.400
was there all the way through.

1127
00:24:56.030 --> 00:25:01.030
It was there all the way through the concrete plans for the extermination of the

1128
00:25:01.251 --> 00:25:04.910
Jews as well as the Gypsies and of gay people as well.

1129
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:05.750
Uh,

1130
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:06.560
this,

1131
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.010
these concrete plans will,

1132
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.530
uh,

1133
00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:10.610
come later.

1134
00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.261
Doc.

1135
00:25:11.261 --> 00:25:12.094
How,

1136
00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:12.860
uh,

1137
00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:17.860
in 1933 was built with him in charge primarily to put communists,

1138
00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:19.680
uh,

1139
00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.820
in the house.

1140
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:22.310
And then later,

1141
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.060
uh,

1142
00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:23.511
of Jews,

1143
00:25:23.511 --> 00:25:24.650
many Jews were communists.

1144
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:25.341
Uh,

1145
00:25:25.341 --> 00:25:26.260
and later,

1146
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:26.440
you know,

1147
00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.200
other people.

1148
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.180
And I went to doc how when I was your age.

1149
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:29.571
And,

1150
00:25:29.571 --> 00:25:30.380
uh,

1151
00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.030
I remember seeing an old guy,

1152
00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:32.930
um,

1153
00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:35.600
working in the fields right outside the wall.

1154
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:39.890
And he was old enough that that guy owned that farm back in nights from during

1155
00:25:39.891 --> 00:25:40.460
the war.

1156
00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:41.121
And people knew,

1157
00:25:41.121 --> 00:25:42.200
I'll come back to that in a minute.

1158
00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:43.490
They knew when you try to think,

1159
00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:47.300
what does he think when he saw the people come in?

1160
00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.270
What did he think when the smoke rose?

1161
00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:50.840
Uh,

1162
00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.030
what did he think they knew?

1163
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.610
They knew and they didn't care.

1164
00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:56.973
Plan.

1165
00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:58.363
Now,

1166
00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.060
if Hitler's themes barely changed,

1167
00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:02.810
uh,

1168
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:05.150
it raises some very important questions.

1169
00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.660
Who First supported Hitler?

1170
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:11.660
Hitler support,

1171
00:26:11.661 --> 00:26:13.040
and I do write about this a little bit,

1172
00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:13.590
that the,

1173
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:16.310
the role of the economic crisis cannot be underestimated.

1174
00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:18.320
The inflation statistics,

1175
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:20.210
you will not want to commit those to memory.

1176
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:21.270
But Art,

1177
00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:22.190
those are unbelievable.

1178
00:26:22.191 --> 00:26:24.110
The only case I know that that's vaguely like that.

1179
00:26:24.111 --> 00:26:24.381
Of course,

1180
00:26:24.381 --> 00:26:25.220
the Zimbabwe,

1181
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:26.000
uh,

1182
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:26.833
uh,

1183
00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:27.080
in,

1184
00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.040
in the [inaudible],

1185
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:28.430
uh,

1186
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:29.330
a period.

1187
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.010
But this is even worse.

1188
00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:31.670
Uh,

1189
00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:33.050
if that is possible.

1190
00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:37.040
And middle class people who had to pawn our,

1191
00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:37.883
and why,

1192
00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:38.391
you know,

1193
00:26:38.391 --> 00:26:39.980
chess drawers,

1194
00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:44.340
silver that had been in their family for years in order had enough to eat,

1195
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:45.660
they wouldn't forget.

1196
00:26:45.661 --> 00:26:46.910
And they blamed and they hate it.

1197
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.350
It's the fault of the allies.

1198
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:50.850
It's the fault of the Jews.

1199
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.470
It's the fault of the socialist.

1200
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.000
It's a fault of the communists.

1201
00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:55.770
It's a fault of Weimar.

1202
00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:59.220
And they first flocked to Hitler.

1203
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.760
The middleclass has to now,

1204
00:27:02.761 --> 00:27:05.100
if this sounds like an Orthodox Marxist interpretation,

1205
00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.960
that's what the Marxist Orthodox say.

1206
00:27:06.961 --> 00:27:07.794
And they're right

1207
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:09.541
now,

1208
00:27:09.541 --> 00:27:13.830
big business did not flock to Hitler.

1209
00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:18.930
Big Business wanted the destruction of Weimar.

1210
00:27:18.931 --> 00:27:20.520
They help make Hitler possible.

1211
00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:24.560
Only one big businessmen gave Hitler a lot of money.

1212
00:27:24.561 --> 00:27:26.210
He got a lot of small donations,

1213
00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.770
but pretty soon he gets started,

1214
00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.600
introduced to the right people,

1215
00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.250
the right cocktail party.

1216
00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.020
They thought he was vulgar.

1217
00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.550
Quick Story.

1218
00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.340
I had a colleague died decades ago,

1219
00:27:37.341 --> 00:27:39.230
was very nice to me when I came here was a German,

1220
00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:40.370
uh,

1221
00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:40.941
diplomatic,

1222
00:27:40.941 --> 00:27:41.451
his story.

1223
00:27:41.451 --> 00:27:43.730
And Cole Haans got ski and he left.

1224
00:27:43.731 --> 00:27:45.440
He wasn't Jewish and he wasn't a communist,

1225
00:27:45.441 --> 00:27:46.274
that's for sure.

1226
00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:46.791
Uh,

1227
00:27:46.791 --> 00:27:48.620
and he left Germany in the,

1228
00:27:48.621 --> 00:27:49.040
in the,

1229
00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:49.490
in the third,

1230
00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:50.001
mid thirties,

1231
00:27:50.001 --> 00:27:52.130
because he didn't like what was going on.

1232
00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.720
He didn't like what's going on.

1233
00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:58.700
And he got a job translating for the Canadian Olympic team.

1234
00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:01.250
And I said to him once,

1235
00:28:01.251 --> 00:28:02.570
did you ever see Hitler?

1236
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.943
And he said yes.

1237
00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:06.920
And he was under the stadium in Berlin.

1238
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:08.450
And like any big stadium,

1239
00:28:08.451 --> 00:28:08.631
you know,

1240
00:28:08.631 --> 00:28:09.464
you've got,

1241
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:11.720
you've got space underneath a lot of places they have,

1242
00:28:11.721 --> 00:28:14.990
you don't batting cages some times was a baseball stadium or something like

1243
00:28:14.991 --> 00:28:15.620
that,

1244
00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:16.311
but he was down there,

1245
00:28:16.311 --> 00:28:17.660
were supposed to meet the Kitty and Olympic team.

1246
00:28:17.661 --> 00:28:22.490
And all of a sudden you heard this enormous roar machinery as you know,

1247
00:28:22.491 --> 00:28:24.200
machine gun carrying,

1248
00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:25.070
uh,

1249
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:26.540
vehicles are coming in.

1250
00:28:26.541 --> 00:28:27.650
And by incredible coincidence,

1251
00:28:27.651 --> 00:28:28.970
he had a couple of pillars here.

1252
00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:30.620
And just about where Leslie is,

1253
00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.790
there was odd off Hitler.

1254
00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:33.770
It was odd.

1255
00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:34.201
Off Hillary.

1256
00:28:34.201 --> 00:28:35.730
He was scared because her machine is all,

1257
00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.070
he stood there frozen and he wasn't,

1258
00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.410
you know what?

1259
00:28:39.411 --> 00:28:40.550
They've got them down.

1260
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:41.240
No.

1261
00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:41.371
Well,

1262
00:28:41.371 --> 00:28:43.580
he just standing there and I said,

1263
00:28:43.581 --> 00:28:44.300
what?

1264
00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.350
What did you think?

1265
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:47.750
What did you think your fifth,

1266
00:28:47.751 --> 00:28:49.790
15 yards away from odd off Hitler,

1267
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:51.103
less than that.

1268
00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:52.723
And he said,

1269
00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.020
I had a weird reaction.

1270
00:28:54.021 --> 00:28:55.070
He was vulgar.

1271
00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.420
He was the Austrian corporal.

1272
00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.870
He sneezed and he blew with nose on his sleep.

1273
00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:05.290
That's what God's key remember now,

1274
00:29:05.291 --> 00:29:06.250
big business,

1275
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:07.090
uh,

1276
00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:08.110
[inaudible] was a moderate,

1277
00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:08.560
you know,

1278
00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:09.250
political,

1279
00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:10.083
uh,

1280
00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:10.631
you know,

1281
00:29:10.631 --> 00:29:11.411
he was not at all,

1282
00:29:11.411 --> 00:29:11.740
I mean,

1283
00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:12.131
not all,

1284
00:29:12.131 --> 00:29:12.360
not,

1285
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:12.880
but uh,

1286
00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.271
but he,

1287
00:29:13.271 --> 00:29:13.840
and he also did,

1288
00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.640
he would believed in the Weimar republic.

1289
00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:16.990
He was a very good guy.

1290
00:29:16.991 --> 00:29:18.220
Rick Aristocratic Guy.

1291
00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:19.600
He was over Ryan Lender.

1292
00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:20.261
He,

1293
00:29:20.261 --> 00:29:21.094
uh,

1294
00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.890
but his reaction was the same as big business,

1295
00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.650
except that they want big business wanting to destroy Weimar.

1296
00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:28.900
But the reaction with a Hitler as a commoner,

1297
00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:29.763
he's vulgar.

1298
00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:30.311
He's,

1299
00:29:30.311 --> 00:29:30.660
uh,

1300
00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:31.030
uh,

1301
00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:32.100
we've got them locked in.

1302
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:33.490
They said in 1933,

1303
00:29:33.491 --> 00:29:36.220
we've got a boxed in and we can use them to our advantage.

1304
00:29:36.221 --> 00:29:40.150
And then have a Miller Charlie dictatorship when von Stauffenberg tries to kill

1305
00:29:40.151 --> 00:29:43.400
Hitler and puts a under the table and it blows up but doesn't kill Hitler

1306
00:29:43.401 --> 00:29:46.540
because of big old German wooden barrier.

1307
00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.490
It was the table,

1308
00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:49.210
uh,

1309
00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:50.110
stood on,

1310
00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:50.501
you know,

1311
00:29:50.501 --> 00:29:53.290
he wasn't trying to bring parliamentary regime back to Germany.

1312
00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:54.940
He wanted to know literary dictatorship.

1313
00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:56.973
Um,

1314
00:29:57.490 --> 00:29:57.850
but,

1315
00:29:57.850 --> 00:29:58.181
but he,

1316
00:29:58.181 --> 00:29:58.421
you know,

1317
00:29:58.421 --> 00:29:58.931
he would,

1318
00:29:58.931 --> 00:29:59.800
Hitler was supported by the,

1319
00:29:59.801 --> 00:30:00.041
by,

1320
00:30:00.041 --> 00:30:00.460
by,

1321
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:00.891
by,

1322
00:30:00.891 --> 00:30:01.040
uh,

1323
00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.710
the middle classes disproportionately at,

1324
00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:04.150
at,

1325
00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:04.900
at the beginning,

1326
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.430
but by all classes,

1327
00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:07.120
uh,

1328
00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.020
people supported him.

1329
00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:10.120
Workers less so,

1330
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.630
but they break in 1933 to destroy the unions.

1331
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.090
They destroy the Communist Party.

1332
00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:17.710
They used the right stock fire,

1333
00:30:17.711 --> 00:30:21.490
which is actually set by the guy probably now we think the Dutch guy,

1334
00:30:21.491 --> 00:30:22.690
who am I right about in there,

1335
00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.460
they destroy the unions.

1336
00:30:24.461 --> 00:30:26.560
They destroy the possibility of resistance.

1337
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.260
But lots of workers where their sig io too,

1338
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:32.470
but less so than the other classes.

1339
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:33.520
What about religion?

1340
00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:34.900
Hitler?

1341
00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.010
Hitler was a southerner.

1342
00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:39.200
He never liked Berlin and all he wanted to raise it or in order,

1343
00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:40.720
and then then build this sort of,

1344
00:30:40.721 --> 00:30:40.931
you know,

1345
00:30:40.931 --> 00:30:41.764
Art Deco,

1346
00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:43.510
a monument of his,

1347
00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.470
his own planning.

1348
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.801
But he was,

1349
00:30:44.801 --> 00:30:45.010
you know,

1350
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:45.580
he was a,

1351
00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:46.660
he was a southern guy,

1352
00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:50.230
but one of the places he first does very well Schleswig-holstein,

1353
00:30:50.231 --> 00:30:51.190
which we've part of it,

1354
00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.740
when it used to be Danish and it's totally Protestant.

1355
00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:55.000
Um,

1356
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.230
the Catholic Church rings the bell and reads what Hitler wants to read from the

1357
00:30:59.231 --> 00:30:59.801
sermons.

1358
00:30:59.801 --> 00:31:00.930
They're happy to have a,

1359
00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:01.750
uh,

1360
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:02.800
have Hitler there,

1361
00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:03.251
uh,

1362
00:31:03.251 --> 00:31:04.210
as are the,

1363
00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:05.133
um,

1364
00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:05.801
you know,

1365
00:31:05.801 --> 00:31:06.270
as,

1366
00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:08.260
as are the Protestants there.

1367
00:31:08.261 --> 00:31:08.620
There's,

1368
00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:09.120
uh,

1369
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:09.800
um,

1370
00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:09.990
uh,

1371
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.230
it,

1372
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:11.920
no doubt about that,

1373
00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:12.721
but the,

1374
00:31:12.721 --> 00:31:13.570
these kinds of,

1375
00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:13.841
you know,

1376
00:31:13.841 --> 00:31:14.001
the,

1377
00:31:14.001 --> 00:31:17.800
the fascism is in the air all over the place and the kinds of,

1378
00:31:17.801 --> 00:31:17.961
the,

1379
00:31:17.961 --> 00:31:21.490
the main elements of fascism that I list,

1380
00:31:21.491 --> 00:31:22.510
if you sit in that book,

1381
00:31:22.511 --> 00:31:23.530
if you think about them,

1382
00:31:23.531 --> 00:31:24.610
they all apply to Hitler,

1383
00:31:24.611 --> 00:31:25.840
into the people who followed him.

1384
00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:27.730
Anticommunist antisocial,

1385
00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:28.631
a Socialist,

1386
00:31:28.631 --> 00:31:29.710
Antivia Amar,

1387
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:30.251
uh,

1388
00:31:30.251 --> 00:31:32.620
the role of the economic crisis with long,

1389
00:31:32.621 --> 00:31:35.890
long memories and hating the allies and hating the Jews.

1390
00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:37.330
And hating the Socialists,

1391
00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.350
uh,

1392
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:39.500
violence that,

1393
00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:39.850
you know,

1394
00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:44.440
the Nazis were at other fascist groups are better at saying whom they were

1395
00:31:44.441 --> 00:31:46.480
against than what they wanted.

1396
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.200
A lot of say what they want is ultra nationalism,

1397
00:31:50.201 --> 00:31:50.801
but they want us to,

1398
00:31:50.801 --> 00:31:54.820
to tell him interior Tyrian state and the destruction of parliamentary rule.

1399
00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:56.680
What they want is a dictator.

1400
00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:57.310
Uh,

1401
00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:58.910
they want to cut deal as,

1402
00:31:58.911 --> 00:31:59.800
as Franco was.

1403
00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.060
They want to do che as,

1404
00:32:01.061 --> 00:32:01.281
as,

1405
00:32:01.281 --> 00:32:02.470
as a Mussolini.

1406
00:32:02.471 --> 00:32:03.280
He called himself,

1407
00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:08.200
they want a few of her or they want a leader who incarnates in that mystical

1408
00:32:08.201 --> 00:32:09.820
body as they would view it.

1409
00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:12.910
The aspirations of the German people

1410
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:17.230
and part of what whom you were is who you are excluding.

1411
00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.940
You have a volkist community in the perverse,

1412
00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.470
biological racism of,

1413
00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:25.500
of these people and other people who aren't in it.

1414
00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.260
Too Bad for them.

1415
00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:29.440
If they are work shy Germans who don't want to work,

1416
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.790
then they're not really part of the,

1417
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:31.241
of,

1418
00:32:31.241 --> 00:32:32.074
of the,

1419
00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:32.541
uh,

1420
00:32:32.541 --> 00:32:33.580
of volkist community.

1421
00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.620
I decide who's a Jew and who isn't.

1422
00:32:35.621 --> 00:32:36.580
That's what Lucas said.

1423
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.713
Hitler says,

1424
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.380
and this is the horror it all.

1425
00:32:39.381 --> 00:32:43.310
We decide who will live and who will die and when they're using euthanasia as a

1426
00:32:43.311 --> 00:32:44.120
tool to,

1427
00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.700
to kill people who are mentally handicapped.

1428
00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:49.040
And even some people who are physically handicapped.

1429
00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:50.840
And Pretty soon in the late thirties,

1430
00:32:50.841 --> 00:32:51.291
the Germans say,

1431
00:32:51.291 --> 00:32:51.620
wait,

1432
00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:52.550
these are Germans,

1433
00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:53.421
you know,

1434
00:32:53.421 --> 00:32:54.400
if there are Jews whom,

1435
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:55.070
and I'm German,

1436
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:56.270
but we don't get service of German,

1437
00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:57.253
that's okay.

1438
00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:58.123
Get rid of them.

1439
00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:00.350
So they pull back on that.

1440
00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:01.281
But it's,

1441
00:33:01.281 --> 00:33:02.570
that's there from the beginning,

1442
00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:04.970
ultra nationalistic,

1443
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:10.040
ultra Antia a parliamentarian as you want the guy,

1444
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.140
he's going to represent you.

1445
00:33:12.141 --> 00:33:13.580
What he's going to tell you what to do.

1446
00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.061
But they did.

1447
00:33:15.061 --> 00:33:16.400
And at the terror is there.

1448
00:33:16.401 --> 00:33:16.611
I mean,

1449
00:33:16.611 --> 00:33:18.050
the violence is there,

1450
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:19.130
the Gestapo,

1451
00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:20.360
uh,

1452
00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:20.750
you know,

1453
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:23.210
people that there are hundreds of thousands of dumb creation.

1454
00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.260
If you did announce somebody,

1455
00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:25.930
you can be sending them to torture and,

1456
00:33:25.931 --> 00:33:26.764
and their death.

1457
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:28.940
There's no question about that.

1458
00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.650
And they're just annunciations all the time.

1459
00:33:30.651 --> 00:33:30.801
Hey,

1460
00:33:30.801 --> 00:33:31.311
my neighbor,

1461
00:33:31.311 --> 00:33:31.701
he,

1462
00:33:31.701 --> 00:33:32.600
I think he's Jewish.

1463
00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:33.680
Uh,

1464
00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.480
I know my neighbor down the hall,

1465
00:33:35.481 --> 00:33:39.590
I know he was a big guy in the s and the German Socialist Party.

1466
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:40.483
SPD.

1467
00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:41.690
I know that,

1468
00:33:41.691 --> 00:33:43.100
that the butcher around the street,

1469
00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:43.700
you know,

1470
00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.770
I might want his store cause I'm a butcher too.

1471
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:50.590
I know he was a communist activist until 1933 and you send it and annunciations

1472
00:33:50.591 --> 00:33:51.620
they got them all the time.

1473
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:53.120
They got them all the time.

1474
00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:54.410
Here's a quote,

1475
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:59.800
somebody describing one of the Gestapo offices and the bureaucratization of

1476
00:34:00.321 --> 00:34:03.200
terror and it's grimy.

1477
00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:04.143
I'm just a quote.

1478
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:09.250
Grimy corridors officer's furnished with Spartan simplicity offices furnished

1479
00:34:09.591 --> 00:34:10.131
with Spartan.

1480
00:34:10.131 --> 00:34:10.791
Simplicity,

1481
00:34:10.791 --> 00:34:11.331
threats,

1482
00:34:11.331 --> 00:34:15.080
kicks troops chasing chain men up and down the reaches of the building,

1483
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:17.620
shouting rows of girls and women's,

1484
00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:17.811
uh,

1485
00:34:17.811 --> 00:34:20.300
standing with their noses and toes against the wall.

1486
00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:21.920
Overflowing Ashtrays,

1487
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.630
portraits of Hitler and his aides.

1488
00:34:23.631 --> 00:34:24.680
The smell of coffee.

1489
00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:28.190
Smartly dressed girls working in a high speed behind typewriters.

1490
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.771
Girl,

1491
00:34:28.771 --> 00:34:31.490
seemingly indifferent to the squalor and agony about them.

1492
00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:33.860
Stacks of conference came to publications,

1493
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:34.910
printing machines,

1494
00:34:34.911 --> 00:34:39.680
books and pictures and Gestapo agents asleep on the table.

1495
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:45.430
Nobody had any illusion about what was going on and they didn't just rule

1496
00:34:46.641 --> 00:34:47.570
through terror.

1497
00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:48.141
You know,

1498
00:34:48.141 --> 00:34:48.891
the SS,

1499
00:34:48.891 --> 00:34:49.401
by the way,

1500
00:34:49.401 --> 00:34:50.234
the SS,

1501
00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:51.530
everybody knows what the ss,

1502
00:34:51.531 --> 00:34:52.940
I mean they'd destroy the essay.

1503
00:34:52.941 --> 00:34:53.540
They,

1504
00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:56.780
Ernst Rohm Challenges Hitler and the night of the long life,

1505
00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:58.310
they wipe them all out.

1506
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.240
The SS was a form of sort of social mobility for people.

1507
00:35:02.241 --> 00:35:04.430
These young guys come back after the war.

1508
00:35:04.431 --> 00:35:06.410
There was no work and pretty soon in the 20s,

1509
00:35:06.411 --> 00:35:06.741
they get it.

1510
00:35:06.741 --> 00:35:07.541
You Ss,

1511
00:35:07.541 --> 00:35:08.450
you've got a uniform,

1512
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:12.470
you can go beat the hell out of out of a communist Jews or anyone else.

1513
00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.640
And there's no,

1514
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:16.540
the judges are all a Nazi sympathizers,

1515
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:17.720
a right wing sympathizers.

1516
00:35:17.721 --> 00:35:19.340
They were all trained in the empire.

1517
00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.000
Uh,

1518
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.640
you can kill somebody and you'll be out of jail in,

1519
00:35:22.641 --> 00:35:22.891
in,

1520
00:35:22.891 --> 00:35:23.171
in a,

1521
00:35:23.171 --> 00:35:23.461
in a,

1522
00:35:23.461 --> 00:35:25.520
in a very short matter of time.

1523
00:35:25.521 --> 00:35:25.761
I mean,

1524
00:35:25.761 --> 00:35:26.031
you're,

1525
00:35:26.031 --> 00:35:27.710
you're working with impunity,

1526
00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:28.290
uh,

1527
00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:31.040
especially in Prussia where we're gerbils as administer of,

1528
00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:31.790
uh,

1529
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:32.020
uh,

1530
00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:32.990
of the interior.

1531
00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:33.943
Um,

1532
00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.860
there's a goring is administer of interior in PR in Prussia.

1533
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:37.860
I don't remember.

1534
00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:38.450
Anyway,

1535
00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:38.690
uh,

1536
00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:39.990
it is all routinize.

1537
00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:40.440
It,

1538
00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.940
it is all there,

1539
00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:44.460
but they don't rule just through terror.

1540
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.540
And that's what I did not emphasize enough in what your,

1541
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:48.320
um,

1542
00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:48.500
in,

1543
00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.300
in what you read and it's going to be in the next edition.

1544
00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:56.960
The Hitler promises order and order is zero tolerance on petty crime for

1545
00:35:59.281 --> 00:36:00.114
example.

1546
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:00.511
Uh,

1547
00:36:00.511 --> 00:36:04.320
and they have police who are called the creepo appropriately enough in English

1548
00:36:04.321 --> 00:36:05.040
translation.

1549
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:05.820
But uh,

1550
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:06.270
uh,

1551
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:10.290
K R I p o and they are so your basic police,

1552
00:36:10.291 --> 00:36:12.640
they're not thinking Estoppel but they go out and,

1553
00:36:12.641 --> 00:36:12.811
and,

1554
00:36:12.811 --> 00:36:16.140
and people who are lounging about who our work shy,

1555
00:36:16.141 --> 00:36:17.880
that's a dangerous thing to be work shy,

1556
00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:18.630
uh,

1557
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.901
you know,

1558
00:36:18.901 --> 00:36:19.740
petty criminals,

1559
00:36:19.741 --> 00:36:20.760
people who are hungry,

1560
00:36:20.761 --> 00:36:21.140
who are,

1561
00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:23.250
who are stealing apples off of fruit stands,

1562
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:24.241
things like that.

1563
00:36:24.241 --> 00:36:26.130
They go out and they make war on them.

1564
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:27.120
Uh,

1565
00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.580
and the German population knots enthusiastically,

1566
00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:29.881
uh,

1567
00:36:29.881 --> 00:36:30.630
overall,

1568
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.811
uh,

1569
00:36:30.811 --> 00:36:31.650
as a,

1570
00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:32.640
as a whole,

1571
00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:32.820
uh,

1572
00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:35.340
the war on crimes is something they like.

1573
00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.140
Now also there's the economy.

1574
00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:40.110
Now Hitler got credit for many German people,

1575
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:40.530
uh,

1576
00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:41.790
for having revived the front,

1577
00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:42.870
the German economy.

1578
00:36:42.871 --> 00:36:43.740
How does he do that?

1579
00:36:43.741 --> 00:36:44.820
He does it by starting,

1580
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:48.150
by violating the statutes of the treaty of Versailles.

1581
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:48.671
And there,

1582
00:36:48.671 --> 00:36:49.890
there are preparing for war.

1583
00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:52.110
He's preparing for war all the way through.

1584
00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:53.910
If the Rheinland occupation,

1585
00:36:53.911 --> 00:36:55.650
the French and the Belgians had had,

1586
00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:57.030
had put up a fuss,

1587
00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.840
it's possible that the whole thing could have been stopped there quick as

1588
00:37:00.841 --> 00:37:01.620
possible.

1589
00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:02.251
The generals are,

1590
00:37:02.251 --> 00:37:02.821
are saying mind.

1591
00:37:02.821 --> 00:37:03.510
Sure her,

1592
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:04.170
you know,

1593
00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:06.390
we're not really ready yet for war.

1594
00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.020
I,

1595
00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.070
while he is,

1596
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.810
is a freezing,

1597
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:10.950
freezing the,

1598
00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:11.341
uh,

1599
00:37:11.341 --> 00:37:11.970
his,

1600
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:15.270
his opponents and they capitulate one time after another.

1601
00:37:15.271 --> 00:37:18.660
And the famous story of Neville Chamberlain had returned bringing peace in his

1602
00:37:18.661 --> 00:37:21.360
time after having sold out Czechoslovakia.

1603
00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:24.480
But the German economy does revive.

1604
00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:28.380
There's still huge gaps between obviously the wealthy and people who aren't

1605
00:37:28.381 --> 00:37:29.214
wealthy,

1606
00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:29.880
uh,

1607
00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.301
uh,

1608
00:37:30.301 --> 00:37:31.500
enormous gaps,

1609
00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:35.310
but the German economy and he takes credit desert vibe because of the same thing

1610
00:37:35.311 --> 00:37:37.140
that happens in the United States and World War Two,

1611
00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:38.970
because you're turning out transforming,

1612
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.481
uh,

1613
00:37:39.481 --> 00:37:40.410
the war economy.

1614
00:37:40.411 --> 00:37:41.550
And that's exactly what happened.

1615
00:37:41.551 --> 00:37:44.490
So he takes credit for this and there are a lot of flashy gestures.

1616
00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:45.630
The VW,

1617
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:48.780
I went around Europe in a VW with couple of my friends sleeping on beaches,

1618
00:37:48.781 --> 00:37:49.710
a little VW,

1619
00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:50.820
the Volkswagen.

1620
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:53.010
But only one of them was ever produced.

1621
00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.200
He promises the German people at Volkswagen,

1622
00:37:55.201 --> 00:37:56.730
but only one model ever.

1623
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:57.421
It comes off,

1624
00:37:57.421 --> 00:37:57.870
you know,

1625
00:37:57.870 --> 00:37:59.100
for the press and all that,

1626
00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:00.023
the Autobahn,

1627
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:01.200
they're going to have roots,

1628
00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:02.130
Autobahn all over.

1629
00:38:02.131 --> 00:38:04.470
Now there are in Germany and people driving 500 miles an hour,

1630
00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:05.160
uh,

1631
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.000
with impunity.

1632
00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:06.590
Uh,

1633
00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:11.030
there are only 500 kilometers or miles of a transfer in the,

1634
00:38:11.031 --> 00:38:16.031
in a miles of a autobahn done by the time he's finished strength through joy.

1635
00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:19.590
He announces a program that the Germans who have never been on vacation,

1636
00:38:19.591 --> 00:38:20.580
ordinary working class,

1637
00:38:20.581 --> 00:38:21.750
Germans can go on vacation.

1638
00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:23.730
Some people did go on vacation,

1639
00:38:23.731 --> 00:38:24.680
they all get drunk on,

1640
00:38:24.681 --> 00:38:25.140
on,

1641
00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:26.260
on cruise boats and,

1642
00:38:26.261 --> 00:38:26.491
and,

1643
00:38:26.491 --> 00:38:26.770
and,

1644
00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:27.410
you know,

1645
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:28.730
all over the place and,

1646
00:38:28.731 --> 00:38:29.011
and,

1647
00:38:29.011 --> 00:38:30.510
but hardly anyone gets to go.

1648
00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:32.630
But he gets credit for it then.

1649
00:38:32.631 --> 00:38:34.350
So he seemed to be producing,

1650
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:38.830
he seen to producing and in a country in which antisemitism,

1651
00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:39.201
uh,

1652
00:38:39.201 --> 00:38:41.410
despite the fact that Jews were terribly assimilated,

1653
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:42.300
ah,

1654
00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:42.970
we're a,

1655
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:43.900
was endemic.

1656
00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:44.440
Uh,

1657
00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.870
they liked the fact that Jews are disappearing.

1658
00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:49.300
They like it and they know it.

1659
00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:51.160
And it's sure nonsense.

1660
00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.850
To think that people didn't know what was going on because as these trials are

1661
00:38:54.851 --> 00:38:56.230
put in the papers all the time,

1662
00:38:56.231 --> 00:39:01.060
so and so's been condemned being sent away to two.call because of anti state

1663
00:39:01.061 --> 00:39:01.650
behavior,

1664
00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:02.860
anti-German behavior,

1665
00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:03.730
you name it.

1666
00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:05.560
People know they have no doubts about it.

1667
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.180
Where do I take the trains are going,

1668
00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:09.070
they can kind of imagine,

1669
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:10.050
uh,

1670
00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:10.800
uh,

1671
00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.141
you know,

1672
00:39:11.141 --> 00:39:12.400
where are these people coming from?

1673
00:39:12.401 --> 00:39:14.350
What and when all the Polish workers are coming in,

1674
00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.300
being brought in as her slave labor,

1675
00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:17.051
slave labor,

1676
00:39:17.051 --> 00:39:18.340
the ones who haven't been destroyed,

1677
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:19.600
uh,

1678
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:20.920
when they're coming to work in the factories,

1679
00:39:20.921 --> 00:39:22.720
where do these people think their families were?

1680
00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:23.321
Well,

1681
00:39:23.321 --> 00:39:24.154
they're all dead.

1682
00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:25.090
Uh,

1683
00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:28.390
that's why ordinary men is such a chilling book because at how these people,

1684
00:39:28.391 --> 00:39:28.870
these,

1685
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:29.081
you know,

1686
00:39:29.081 --> 00:39:30.490
this police officer brigade,

1687
00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:31.240
uh,

1688
00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:33.490
in Homburg how these people can put bullets in the,

1689
00:39:33.491 --> 00:39:36.530
in the backs of the heads of old ladies and little children in the,

1690
00:39:36.531 --> 00:39:40.390
in the killing fields of around wallets or anywhere else in Poland is just an

1691
00:39:40.391 --> 00:39:41.224
extraordinary story.

1692
00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.250
People knew.

1693
00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:43.061
Not everybody knew,

1694
00:39:43.061 --> 00:39:43.900
but they knew.

1695
00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:45.123
They knew.

1696
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:45.761
Uh,

1697
00:39:45.761 --> 00:39:46.071
and,

1698
00:39:46.071 --> 00:39:47.500
and for people who wanted order,

1699
00:39:47.501 --> 00:39:48.400
this was their idea.

1700
00:39:48.401 --> 00:39:49.990
This was the racial idea of order.

1701
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:51.010
The universities,

1702
00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:52.270
what happens to the universities?

1703
00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:53.050
Well,

1704
00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:54.460
certain fields do very well.

1705
00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:55.510
Racial hygiene.

1706
00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:58.000
They established established chairs and racial hygiene,

1707
00:39:58.300 --> 00:39:59.500
a German folklore,

1708
00:39:59.501 --> 00:40:01.720
they established chairs and German folklore.

1709
00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:03.820
Physics does very well for obvious reasons.

1710
00:40:03.821 --> 00:40:05.860
Physically equals equals rockets,

1711
00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:06.460
uh,

1712
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.750
military history,

1713
00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:10.270
chairs and military history chairs in,

1714
00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:10.820
in,

1715
00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:13.600
in German history chairs and particularly in German,

1716
00:40:13.601 --> 00:40:14.590
medieval history.

1717
00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:15.370
But,

1718
00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:16.270
but anything else,

1719
00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:16.691
you know,

1720
00:40:16.691 --> 00:40:17.710
your basic history,

1721
00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:18.450
uh,

1722
00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:19.283
um,

1723
00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:21.220
German literature for example,

1724
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.180
uh,

1725
00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:22.511
uh,

1726
00:40:22.511 --> 00:40:23.800
it doesn't do very well.

1727
00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:24.280
Uh,

1728
00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:27.040
there was a famous headline than I that isn't in the book,

1729
00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:27.550
uh,

1730
00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:27.671
uh,

1731
00:40:27.671 --> 00:40:29.170
saluting the fact that people were,

1732
00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:33.040
there were less visits to libraries and people were checking out books and far

1733
00:40:33.041 --> 00:40:34.600
fewer numbers than they did before.

1734
00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:35.350
Um,

1735
00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:36.580
how do they pull this off?

1736
00:40:36.581 --> 00:40:39.910
They pull it off through sort of the atomization of society.

1737
00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:41.320
Uh,

1738
00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.290
and that one of the ways that there's a really wonderful book called the Nazi

1739
00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:45.280
seizure of power,

1740
00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:45.821
uh,

1741
00:40:45.821 --> 00:40:47.620
written about a town near Hanover,

1742
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:48.120
uh,

1743
00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.140
and he changes the name of the town.

1744
00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.800
But then people were so proud of that book in the 1960s,

1745
00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:54.970
in 1970s,

1746
00:40:54.971 --> 00:40:55.631
they put stacks.

1747
00:40:55.631 --> 00:40:55.881
I'm say,

1748
00:40:55.881 --> 00:40:56.714
that's us.

1749
00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.750
That's us who were beating up the Jews.

1750
00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.210
That's us who were beating up the communists.

1751
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:02.920
We are so proud.

1752
00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:03.520
Uh,

1753
00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.331
it's a very good book,

1754
00:41:04.331 --> 00:41:06.280
William share down the Nazi seizure of power.

1755
00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:09.640
And there's another good book by Rudy Kosher or a friend of mine at Wisconsin

1756
00:41:09.641 --> 00:41:10.270
on,

1757
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:12.130
on a Marburg and a ton of Marburg.

1758
00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:16.450
What they do is they get Nazis into every voluntary association basically,

1759
00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:17.020
uh,

1760
00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:17.920
and they take them over.

1761
00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:21.190
And so what you have is the atomization of society.

1762
00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:24.900
That what Ian Kershaw calls going to the fuel.

1763
00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:28.330
Her only thing left is the family.

1764
00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:32.410
You protect yourself in the family or you thrive in the family,

1765
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:35.320
but you're the family and your,

1766
00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:36.920
your children are in a Hitler youth.

1767
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:37.880
Uh,

1768
00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:38.340
you,

1769
00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:39.000
uh,

1770
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:39.680
uh,

1771
00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:40.071
uh,

1772
00:41:40.071 --> 00:41:43.100
there is no possible organized wave opposition,

1773
00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:44.480
soccer clubs,

1774
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:45.110
football clubs,

1775
00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:45.841
everything is,

1776
00:41:45.841 --> 00:41:46.081
is,

1777
00:41:46.081 --> 00:41:46.321
is,

1778
00:41:46.321 --> 00:41:50.150
is a part of the atomization because it's been taken over by the Nazis.

1779
00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:52.790
There is almost no resistance in Germany.

1780
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:54.470
I'll talk a little bit about this next time,

1781
00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:55.603
um,

1782
00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.000
because this was a regime as capable as they did and Dusseldorf of,

1783
00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:01.220
of hanging 16 year old boys,

1784
00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:01.790
uh,

1785
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:05.270
because they listened to Benny Goodman or were considered to be slackers or work

1786
00:42:05.271 --> 00:42:05.990
shy.

1787
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.560
There's the,

1788
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.790
there's that phrase again.

1789
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:08.900
So this autumn is,

1790
00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.130
this atomization,

1791
00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:11.110
uh,

1792
00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:11.630
of,

1793
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.941
of,

1794
00:42:11.941 --> 00:42:15.380
of German society makes all of this possible.

1795
00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:16.280
And the most,

1796
00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:16.490
you know,

1797
00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:18.470
when Staffan replaces his bomb and the thing,

1798
00:42:18.471 --> 00:42:18.890
you know,

1799
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:20.540
thing blows up and it doesn't kill Hitler,

1800
00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.580
Hitler amuse himself and his friends by,

1801
00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:25.250
by all the people and all the families and people involved,

1802
00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:25.761
uh,

1803
00:42:25.761 --> 00:42:27.740
they film them being thrown slowly,

1804
00:42:27.741 --> 00:42:30.950
strangled with was wire and they laughed as they,

1805
00:42:30.951 --> 00:42:31.880
as they watch the film.

1806
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.380
But the most amazing chilling thing,

1807
00:42:33.381 --> 00:42:34.214
even more than that,

1808
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:39.430
it's the Germans pouring into the street in 30 or 40 different cities is bombs

1809
00:42:39.431 --> 00:42:41.330
had been raining down all the time.

1810
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:42.441
And they think,

1811
00:42:42.441 --> 00:42:42.891
God,

1812
00:42:42.891 --> 00:42:43.460
my God,

1813
00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:44.570
you saved our fuel,

1814
00:42:44.571 --> 00:42:45.404
her.

1815
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:46.280
Whoa,

1816
00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:49.250
that's extraordinarily difficult to explain.

1817
00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:50.840
And by 1944,

1818
00:42:50.841 --> 00:42:53.200
the armies are full of old men and boys,

1819
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:54.230
you know,

1820
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.770
cause everybody,

1821
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:57.040
basically everybody else's dad and the,

1822
00:42:57.041 --> 00:42:58.310
and they keep fighting.

1823
00:42:58.460 --> 00:42:59.570
They fight until,

1824
00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:00.530
uh,

1825
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:00.831
you know,

1826
00:43:00.831 --> 00:43:03.020
with astonishing and foolish courage,

1827
00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:03.501
uh,

1828
00:43:03.501 --> 00:43:04.334
until uh,

1829
00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:04.940
the bitter,

1830
00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:05.773
bitter end.

1831
00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:08.870
They believe not everybody believed.

1832
00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:09.530
Uh,

1833
00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:11.120
and there'll be a revival of,

1834
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.481
but you know,

1835
00:43:11.481 --> 00:43:14.990
even in the German federal public was just replete with,

1836
00:43:14.991 --> 00:43:15.231
with,

1837
00:43:15.231 --> 00:43:15.530
with,

1838
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:15.930
uh,

1839
00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:16.160
you know,

1840
00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:16.730
former,

1841
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:17.070
uh,

1842
00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:17.630
uh,

1843
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:19.460
very proud former Nazis who take,

1844
00:43:19.461 --> 00:43:19.731
take,

1845
00:43:19.731 --> 00:43:19.941
you know,

1846
00:43:19.941 --> 00:43:21.470
hugely important positions and,

1847
00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:22.030
uh,

1848
00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:23.150
in power after that.

1849
00:43:23.151 --> 00:43:23.511
And of course,

1850
00:43:23.511 --> 00:43:24.530
the good old Americans,

1851
00:43:24.531 --> 00:43:25.070
uh,

1852
00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:25.221
uh,

1853
00:43:25.221 --> 00:43:25.431
you know,

1854
00:43:25.431 --> 00:43:26.181
help a lot of these,

1855
00:43:26.181 --> 00:43:30.680
a Nazi war criminals escape to Paraguay and places like that in exchange for

1856
00:43:30.681 --> 00:43:31.550
information about,

1857
00:43:31.551 --> 00:43:32.140
about,

1858
00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:32.330
you know,

1859
00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:34.580
communist movements and that sort of thing.

1860
00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:38.720
They believe they believe and they believe not everybody believed.

1861
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.500
Uh,

1862
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:39.861
but,

1863
00:43:39.861 --> 00:43:40.071
but,

1864
00:43:40.071 --> 00:43:44.270
but that's one of the scariest things about the whole thing is that it was sig

1865
00:43:44.271 --> 00:43:45.890
heil until the end.

1866
00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:46.191
Again,

1867
00:43:46.191 --> 00:43:47.060
not for everybody,

1868
00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.440
not for everybody,

1869
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.950
but for some social classes and others.

1870
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:52.971
It was a,

1871
00:43:52.971 --> 00:43:54.620
and you find this in other countries,

1872
00:43:54.621 --> 00:43:56.210
and I'll talk a little bit about that when I talk to him.

1873
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:57.290
I guess I'll talk mostly about,

1874
00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:58.423
about France,

1875
00:43:59.060 --> 00:43:59.893
about France,

1876
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.440
uh,

1877
00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:01.280
next time.

1878
00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:02.510
Um,

1879
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:03.320
so,

1880
00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:04.153
um,

1881
00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:04.870
he,

1882
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:05.181
you know,

1883
00:44:05.181 --> 00:44:05.320
he,

1884
00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:10.320
Hitler Hitler gives them basically what the German people,

1885
00:44:12.621 --> 00:44:14.810
what they want and his prestige,

1886
00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:15.440
right?

1887
00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:17.270
Every time he stands down,

1888
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:18.320
uh,

1889
00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:18.771
Britain,

1890
00:44:18.771 --> 00:44:20.330
the British and the French,

1891
00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.000
every time that he pulls this off,

1892
00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:23.780
uh,

1893
00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:25.310
the occupation of the Rheinland,

1894
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:26.240
uh,

1895
00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.510
the absorption of the Sioux Dayton,

1896
00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:30.260
uh,

1897
00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:31.340
part of Bohemia,

1898
00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:33.060
and then they just take over the whole country,

1899
00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:36.390
the Anschluss where he's greeted enthusiastically by the crowd.

1900
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:40.200
You can see these photos of the adoring Viennese crowds,

1901
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:41.300
uh,

1902
00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:41.520
in a,

1903
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.540
where was the Vienna of,

1904
00:44:42.541 --> 00:44:42.841
of,

1905
00:44:42.841 --> 00:44:43.261
of,

1906
00:44:43.261 --> 00:44:43.800
uh,

1907
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:44.020
uh,

1908
00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:45.630
of calm concerts.

1909
00:44:45.631 --> 00:44:47.190
It became the Vienna Wagner.

1910
00:44:47.191 --> 00:44:47.940
It became the,

1911
00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:48.220
uh,

1912
00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:48.961
the Vienna of,

1913
00:44:48.961 --> 00:44:49.251
of,

1914
00:44:49.251 --> 00:44:49.560
uh,

1915
00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:49.810
of,

1916
00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:54.210
of saluting Hitler and then going out and beating up and killing Jews.

1917
00:44:54.211 --> 00:44:56.560
Something like a hundred user are murdered in,

1918
00:44:56.561 --> 00:44:56.751
in,

1919
00:44:56.751 --> 00:44:56.991
in,

1920
00:44:56.991 --> 00:44:57.824
in Vienna.

1921
00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:03.380
When Hitler arrives to celebrate the arrival of I'd off Hiller.

1922
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:04.630
Uh,

1923
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:05.431
it's,

1924
00:45:05.431 --> 00:45:06.300
they too,

1925
00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:06.691
you know,

1926
00:45:06.691 --> 00:45:06.940
they,

1927
00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:07.920
they believed in one of the,

1928
00:45:07.921 --> 00:45:08.071
you know,

1929
00:45:08.071 --> 00:45:11.760
the dark secrets of course was a Nazi pass of the former secretary general of

1930
00:45:11.761 --> 00:45:14.220
the United Nations could Waldheim and that came out.

1931
00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:15.750
All this came out before,

1932
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.171
you know,

1933
00:45:16.171 --> 00:45:17.970
before most of you are reading newspapers,

1934
00:45:17.971 --> 00:45:18.810
some of you are reading them,

1935
00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:19.660
uh,

1936
00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:19.820
uh,

1937
00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:20.011
uh,

1938
00:45:20.011 --> 00:45:21.390
back then because it was about what,

1939
00:45:21.391 --> 00:45:23.070
15 years ago or something like that.

1940
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:23.850
Uh,

1941
00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:24.683
the people,

1942
00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:25.081
uh,

1943
00:45:25.081 --> 00:45:26.910
the people knew.

1944
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:27.780
Um,

1945
00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:30.570
so those are the really the big points,

1946
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.870
uh,

1947
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:31.281
that I,

1948
00:45:31.281 --> 00:45:31.591
that I,

1949
00:45:31.591 --> 00:45:32.700
that I wanted to make.

1950
00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.110
And when,

1951
00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:34.800
um,

1952
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:35.221
uh,

1953
00:45:35.221 --> 00:45:38.460
when you were reading a German women are German men sitting,

1954
00:45:38.461 --> 00:45:39.660
waiting to get their hair done.

1955
00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:41.040
When you read,

1956
00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:42.510
you read a popular newspaper,

1957
00:45:42.511 --> 00:45:43.980
which are popular magazine,

1958
00:45:43.981 --> 00:45:45.630
all of which had had articles about,

1959
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:48.270
about Hitler and this sort of entourage and all that.

1960
00:45:48.271 --> 00:45:48.691
And you read,

1961
00:45:48.691 --> 00:45:49.160
uh,

1962
00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:49.590
uh,

1963
00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:49.771
you know,

1964
00:45:49.771 --> 00:45:53.640
a cheery headlines such as gas mask for children now readied,

1965
00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:54.690
uh,

1966
00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:55.170
uh,

1967
00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:56.760
you've sort of nodded incest yet,

1968
00:45:56.761 --> 00:45:58.860
yet we will be ready for,

1969
00:45:59.010 --> 00:45:59.400
uh,

1970
00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:02.190
the struggle because what happened was mine comp,

1971
00:46:02.191 --> 00:46:02.940
this struggle,

1972
00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:03.300
uh,

1973
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:03.991
Hitler's book,

1974
00:46:03.991 --> 00:46:08.991
mind coffee became perceived of an adopted by the majority of people,

1975
00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:09.680
uh,

1976
00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:09.810
uh,

1977
00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:10.710
in Germany.

1978
00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:11.573
And they,

1979
00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:12.260
you know,

1980
00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:12.630
uh,

1981
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:13.650
tragically enough,

1982
00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:14.130
uh,

1983
00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:15.720
they remain with,

1984
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:16.230
um,

1985
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:17.220
without off Hitler,

1986
00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:17.791
uh,

1987
00:46:17.791 --> 00:46:18.480
and,

1988
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:18.721
uh,

1989
00:46:18.721 --> 00:46:19.940
and the Nazis until,

1990
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:20.790
and told the,

1991
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:21.181
uh,

1992
00:46:21.181 --> 00:46:21.621
the very,

1993
00:46:21.621 --> 00:46:22.110
very,

1994
00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:22.290
uh,

1995
00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:23.220
a bitter end.

1996
00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:24.690
And of course,

1997
00:46:24.691 --> 00:46:29.340
it's important to see the context is that in all of these places,

1998
00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:31.440
whether you're talking about Brussels,

1999
00:46:31.441 --> 00:46:33.450
whether you're talking about Amsterdam,

2000
00:46:33.451 --> 00:46:34.680
whether you're talking about,

2001
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:35.430
uh,

2002
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:36.263
uh,

2003
00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:37.660
we've heard about Prague,

2004
00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.060
any place you're talking about it in,

2005
00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:44.340
in Europe or Oswald Mosley strutting through Hyde Park with his,

2006
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:44.960
his,

2007
00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:45.470
uh,

2008
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:45.841
a little,

2009
00:46:45.841 --> 00:46:47.310
not sealing followers.

2010
00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:48.000
Uh,

2011
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.180
Hitler was just the,

2012
00:46:49.181 --> 00:46:49.400
the,

2013
00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:50.820
the most violent,

2014
00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:51.780
uh,

2015
00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:52.051
uh,

2016
00:46:52.051 --> 00:46:53.130
the most egregious,

2017
00:46:53.131 --> 00:46:53.970
the most horrible,

2018
00:46:53.971 --> 00:46:54.900
the most tragic,

2019
00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:57.330
a example of what was the general,

2020
00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:57.980
uh,

2021
00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:58.081
uh,

2022
00:46:58.081 --> 00:46:58.631
phenomenon.

2023
00:46:58.631 --> 00:47:00.150
And throughout the entire period,

2024
00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:00.930
uh,

2025
00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:02.520
at different degrees of success,

2026
00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:03.120
uh,

2027
00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:03.680
during,

2028
00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:04.050
uh,

2029
00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:05.340
the twenties and thirties.

2030
00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:10.580
And so the war that began in 1949 and 1914 basically does not end,

2031
00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:12.150
uh,

2032
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.983
until,

2033
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.801
uh,

2034
00:47:13.801 --> 00:47:15.990
at least in Europe until the,

2035
00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:16.471
uh,

2036
00:47:16.471 --> 00:47:17.304
the defeat,

2037
00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:17.880
uh,

2038
00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:19.440
finally of,

2039
00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:20.101
uh,

2040
00:47:20.101 --> 00:47:20.711
of,

2041
00:47:20.711 --> 00:47:23.270
of Germany and the death of Idof.

2042
00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:27.690
Hitler is still at a relatively young age in the bunker in Berlin.
