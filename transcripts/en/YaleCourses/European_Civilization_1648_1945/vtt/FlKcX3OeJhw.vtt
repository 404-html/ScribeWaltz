1
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:01.923
Okay.

2
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.840
I want to talk about Peter the great today.

3
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:06.130
And,

4
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.963
um,

5
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.870
I,

6
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:08.171
you know,

7
00:00:08.171 --> 00:00:10.880
the Russian empire is one of those empires that,

8
00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:11.170
that,

9
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.280
that continued,

10
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.120
uh,

11
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.830
arguably not arguably that's the case.

12
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:15.011
Uh,

13
00:00:15.011 --> 00:00:15.880
after,

14
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.360
uh,

15
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.910
the MPAA four empires disappeared with World War One.

16
00:00:18.911 --> 00:00:19.061
Well,

17
00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:20.480
the Russian empire continues.

18
00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:22.990
So it continues under a somewhat a different,

19
00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:24.040
a very different,

20
00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:24.760
uh,

21
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.660
um,

22
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.110
uh,

23
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.460
in a different way,

24
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.760
uh,

25
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.271
with the,

26
00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:31.390
what became the Soviet Empire because that's what it would,

27
00:00:31.391 --> 00:00:32.590
it became a,

28
00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:33.041
and of course,

29
00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:33.840
with the,

30
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.850
with the end of a,

31
00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:38.640
of the Soviet Union in 1991,

32
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.483
92,

33
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.540
um,

34
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.780
the Soviet empire collapsed.

35
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.210
So Union claps,

36
00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:48.580
and I guess the only remaining empire in the world is that of the United States,

37
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.210
I,

38
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.830
which is a more informal empire,

39
00:00:50.831 --> 00:00:53.470
but still one that is out there almost everywhere with it,

40
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.160
uh,

41
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.120
military basis,

42
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.930
everywhere.

43
00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.010
So the rise and fall of empires is,

44
00:00:58.011 --> 00:00:58.300
is,

45
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.420
is obviously a theme of,

46
00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.910
uh,

47
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.820
of this course.

48
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.310
And the Russian empire.

49
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.690
The state of Moscow v,

50
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.770
uh,

51
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:06.603
had already begun,

52
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.320
had already expanded greatly,

53
00:01:08.321 --> 00:01:09.790
but it's really Peter the great,

54
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.360
it's the Big Guy who expanded,

55
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:14.081
uh,

56
00:01:14.081 --> 00:01:14.914
Russia,

57
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.580
uh,

58
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.960
as territorial size,

59
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.700
uh,

60
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.861
uh,

61
00:01:17.861 --> 00:01:18.880
enormously.

62
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.840
Um,

63
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.673
and so,

64
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.611
you know,

65
00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:26.611
Ma Muscovy had been one of the tributaries of the Mongols who sacked Kiev in

66
00:01:29.081 --> 00:01:29.260
the,

67
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.520
in the 12th 30s,

68
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.020
a after pouring into Russia.

69
00:01:32.021 --> 00:01:33.990
And what now is Ukraine,

70
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.770
um,

71
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.101
and,

72
00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:36.310
and Muscovy was,

73
00:01:36.311 --> 00:01:37.660
it was a prince that was a,

74
00:01:37.661 --> 00:01:38.494
uh,

75
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.971
was a,

76
00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:40.270
a princely state.

77
00:01:40.271 --> 00:01:45.271
And it gradually expanded in size or reaching the southern euro mountains in the

78
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.931
Caspian Sea and,

79
00:01:46.931 --> 00:01:48.970
and emerging as a dynastic,

80
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.630
uh,

81
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.463
state.

82
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:51.160
Uh,

83
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.880
but yet,

84
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.640
uh,

85
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.920
Muscovy was considerably less important than the Commonwealth of Poland

86
00:01:56.921 --> 00:01:57.820
Lithuania,

87
00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.480
uh,

88
00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.710
which was considerably much,

89
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.201
uh,

90
00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:02.050
a greater and subject to,

91
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.860
uh,

92
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.840
struggles with and influenced by,

93
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.441
uh,

94
00:02:05.441 --> 00:02:06.070
that,

95
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.970
that state.

96
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.720
Um,

97
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.250
and it's what Peter,

98
00:02:09.251 --> 00:02:10.084
the great,

99
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.601
uh,

100
00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:14.320
did was he pushed back.

101
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.300
The neighbors who had blocked the expansion of,

102
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.500
of Moscow have Muscovy,

103
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.901
uh,

104
00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:24.730
that is Sweden who me defeats in a battle worth noting.

105
00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:27.420
And Poltava Polt Ava,

106
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.290
it's in the book 1709,

107
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.770
Poland and the Ottoman Turks,

108
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.220
uh,

109
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.551
Peter,

110
00:02:33.551 --> 00:02:38.551
the great ads territory beyond the euro mountains along the Caspian Sea,

111
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.690
at the expense of the Turks.

112
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.440
Uh,

113
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.960
like all of his successors,

114
00:02:43.961 --> 00:02:48.961
he dreamed of conquering the Turkish con capa capital of Constantinople that as

115
00:02:49.091 --> 00:02:49.924
Istanbul,

116
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.540
which have given him control of the Straits,

117
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.850
would have given them control of the Straits.

118
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:55.570
Uh,

119
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.440
um,

120
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.393
uh,

121
00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.770
the Dardanelles Straits are there,

122
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.251
uh,

123
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:03.990
the passage between Europe and in Asia leading to the Black Sea and I,

124
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.180
all that stuff really matters because all of these events now with,

125
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:07.481
with,

126
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:08.050
uh,

127
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.201
uh,

128
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:09.760
the problems in Georgia,

129
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.240
uh,

130
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.290
and that's a very,

131
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.000
very delicate to,

132
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:13.620
uh,

133
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.800
uh,

134
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.760
a strange situation where the great power now in the United States finds itself

135
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:20.020
rather in Congress.

136
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.600
They arguing that that Kosovo,

137
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.770
which should be a obviously independent,

138
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:26.470
I remember going to patch him in Kosovo when I was a kid.

139
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:27.550
Uh,

140
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.890
that that is a little hard to argue that closable should be independent and,

141
00:03:30.891 --> 00:03:32.740
and that what was the territorial,

142
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.770
a unit of Serbia should not be respected.

143
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:39.640
I agree with this because of oil should be independent and to argue that Tibet

144
00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:40.474
should be,

145
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.351
should be free.

146
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:42.310
And I agree with that.

147
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:44.410
And then it turned around and argue that the people in,

148
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:45.041
in,

149
00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:46.860
in Georgia who are not Georgians,

150
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.500
uh,

151
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.410
should not have the same rights that the people in closer we'll have.

152
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.741
Uh,

153
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:52.630
the whole thing of the presentation and the in the,

154
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:53.280
in the press process,

155
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.060
absolutely hypocritical and just,

156
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.390
just,

157
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.260
just bizarre.

158
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.330
But the only point of that little diatribe,

159
00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.960
uh,

160
00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.890
in parentheses,

161
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.251
uh,

162
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:02.860
was that the Black Sea really does still matter a lot.

163
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:03.071
And,

164
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:03.421
and that,

165
00:04:03.421 --> 00:04:04.930
that Peter the Great was the first,

166
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.650
uh,

167
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.460
of the,

168
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.980
of the Russian tsars to dream of,

169
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.580
of this access on a,

170
00:04:11.581 --> 00:04:13.030
the to the Black Sea.

171
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.511
Uh,

172
00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:14.590
and then finally,

173
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:15.220
uh,

174
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.491
uh,

175
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:19.330
to controlling of this traits of Constantinople and Catherine the great are they

176
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:20.680
all like to call themselves the great,

177
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.490
uh,

178
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.000
uh,

179
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.840
she would,

180
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.080
uh,

181
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.000
make this an important part of her policy,

182
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:26.380
but she doesn't get there either.

183
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.950
Uh,

184
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.390
and in the 19th century,

185
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.870
uh,

186
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:29.450
the Russians,

187
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.210
ours are still trying to get there.

188
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.840
Uh,

189
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.470
uh,

190
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.771
uh,

191
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:36.400
as well of a Peter's new fleet.

192
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:37.870
We'll talk about his new fleet,

193
00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:38.970
which he oversaw it.

194
00:04:38.971 --> 00:04:40.450
And even in a very minor way,

195
00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:45.100
help build himself a sales don the Don River in 1698.

196
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.940
And it takes the Turkish port of,

197
00:04:46.941 --> 00:04:47.440
uh,

198
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.273
as off a,

199
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.280
a z o s v on the Sea of as off a z o v a.

200
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.260
And this gave them access to the Black Sea,

201
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.790
but then they're forced to a backup.

202
00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.870
They lose and they're,

203
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:00.783
they're forced to,

204
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:01.510
uh,

205
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.811
uh,

206
00:05:01.811 --> 00:05:02.140
to,

207
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.640
to a surrender as off to the Turks after an unsuccessful war.

208
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:07.750
And so Peter the Great,

209
00:05:07.751 --> 00:05:10.960
despite his dramatic expansion of,

210
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:11.794
um,

211
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.521
uh,

212
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:13.241
of the,

213
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:13.710
uh,

214
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.910
of the,

215
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:14.171
of the,

216
00:05:14.171 --> 00:05:16.300
of the Russian empire,

217
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.481
uh,

218
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:20.980
does not get this outlet on a of the Black Sea.

219
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.401
Uh,

220
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:21.821
but what,

221
00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:22.091
what,

222
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:23.400
what does change and,

223
00:05:23.401 --> 00:05:23.950
and the rep,

224
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.230
what the Battle of Representatives,

225
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.040
of course it's Poltava is that Russia's participation in European affairs had

226
00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:30.490
been,

227
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.320
had been totally minimal.

228
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.790
I'm is a story often told and even told in the book that you're kind enough to

229
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:37.450
read,

230
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.601
uh,

231
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:39.520
that I think it was Louis the 14th that his,

232
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:40.000
uh,

233
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.490
equivalent of Minister of foreign affairs sends a letter,

234
00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:46.390
a formal letter to a Russian czar who couldn't amend Louie the 14th.

235
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:47.290
But one of those dudes,

236
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:48.110
uh,

237
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.650
uh,

238
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:49.320
uh,

239
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.570
I mean,

240
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:50.650
it might've been a two,

241
00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:52.780
a czar who had been dead for 12 years.

242
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.590
Uh,

243
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:54.700
Russia was,

244
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.890
was that far away and it was not in the,

245
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.100
of,

246
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.281
uh,

247
00:05:58.281 --> 00:05:59.150
of the great,

248
00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.520
uh,

249
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.770
of the great powers.

250
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.580
Um,

251
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.780
but after,

252
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:03.410
uh,

253
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.790
one of Peter's victories,

254
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.211
uh,

255
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:09.470
the Russian ambassador in Vienna reported that the news of Peter's victory

256
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.010
began.

257
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.200
People began to a fear of the czars formally,

258
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.730
Eh,

259
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.630
formerly as they feared Sweden.

260
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.110
And it's very difficult to us to imagine a fear of Sweden.

261
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.920
Uh,

262
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.370
but,

263
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.820
uh,

264
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:20.031
the,

265
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:20.900
the fear of,

266
00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:21.260
uh,

267
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.500
uh,

268
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:21.661
the,

269
00:06:21.661 --> 00:06:25.280
the last real Gustavus Adolphus during the,

270
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:26.114
during the,

271
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.481
uh,

272
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:29.510
the 30 years war with the last release or major,

273
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.110
a Swedish interlude and continental European affairs,

274
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.470
uh,

275
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.930
they'll Poltava it doesn't come to defeat of Poltava,

276
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:37.340
doesn't come till a toll.

277
00:06:37.341 --> 00:06:39.350
1709.

278
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.423
Um,

279
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:41.570
so,

280
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:42.140
uh,

281
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.450
uh,

282
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:43.071
of what,

283
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:43.770
uh,

284
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:44.450
um,

285
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.150
but what he does is that,

286
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.960
um,

287
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.793
he,

288
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.120
I there's no other European state expanding their empires overseas in the case

289
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:59.270
of the Spanish and the English that adds so much territory,

290
00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.930
uh,

291
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.300
on land to its empire,

292
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.110
um,

293
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.790
between the 1620s,

294
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:05.301
uh,

295
00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:07.130
and the 1740s,

296
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.720
uh,

297
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.080
the,

298
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.421
the,

299
00:07:08.421 --> 00:07:13.421
the land of the empire and the Russian Empire increases from 2.1 million square

300
00:07:13.611 --> 00:07:17.990
miles to 5.9 million square miles.

301
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.560
Now,

302
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.393
to be sure,

303
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:19.580
uh,

304
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.540
in Siberia,

305
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.150
in the far reaches of,

306
00:07:22.151 --> 00:07:23.090
of the north of,

307
00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:24.230
of North Asia,

308
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:24.571
uh,

309
00:07:24.571 --> 00:07:28.160
this empire amounted to little more than a series of trading posts.

310
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:28.940
Uh,

311
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.110
and it took a very long time for any sort of semblance of Russian authority from

312
00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:37.220
Moscow and soon from Saint Petersburg for reasons that we'll see to reach there.

313
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.690
But,

314
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:38.540
but nonetheless,

315
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.870
uh,

316
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:43.370
Peter the great creates this huge empire that will have over the alarm went and

317
00:07:43.371 --> 00:07:47.000
enormous influence in European affairs because after all,

318
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:47.331
uh,

319
00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:48.070
Russia,

320
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.170
uh,

321
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:48.741
European,

322
00:07:48.741 --> 00:07:50.570
Russia is part of Europe,

323
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.170
uh,

324
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.720
and we'll have an enormous influence,

325
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:54.410
uh,

326
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.410
on Asian affairs as well.

327
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.310
A witness,

328
00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.840
the Russell Japanese war,

329
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:00.180
uh,

330
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.310
in 1904,

331
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.510
1905,

332
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:02.811
uh,

333
00:08:02.811 --> 00:08:03.980
that the Russians lose.

334
00:08:03.981 --> 00:08:08.981
And this is a key moment in the evolution of revolutionary politics in Russia as

335
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.620
we,

336
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.150
uh,

337
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:10.460
uh,

338
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.090
she'll,

339
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:11.391
uh,

340
00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:12.224
and we shall see,

341
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:13.040
uh,

342
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.873
uh,

343
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.350
a little later on.

344
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:16.371
Now what about Peter?

345
00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:17.180
The great,

346
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.880
I used to ask my friend publish Covich to come in and call you to give the

347
00:08:19.881 --> 00:08:20.221
lecture.

348
00:08:20.221 --> 00:08:21.790
And then I guess we're interested in it that I,

349
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:23.270
I did some reading on my own.

350
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:23.540
I,

351
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.290
Leslie,

352
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:24.770
what's her name?

353
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:25.160
Um,

354
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:25.700
uh,

355
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.960
Lindsay Hughes and,

356
00:08:26.961 --> 00:08:27.171
and,

357
00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:28.700
and the various other people.

358
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:30.650
And so puts this together.

359
00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:31.230
Um,

360
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:31.610
uh,

361
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:31.840
uh,

362
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.840
last semester,

363
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:33.170
uh,

364
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:38.170
because he is not a terribly engaging or you know,

365
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.800
warm personality in many ways since he enjoyed watching people being tortured.

366
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.570
I including his own son.

367
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.410
Uh,

368
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.620
but he is an interesting person and one of the things he does,

369
00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:49.820
and I guess this is one of the,

370
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.301
you know,

371
00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:53.720
the things that we put in neon from this lecture is he opens up Russia,

372
00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:59.680
which had no secular influences at all to western ideas.

373
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:02.730
Uh,

374
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.780
and so this is an extraordinarily important and transforming,

375
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:07.973
uh,

376
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:13.230
accomplishment of Peter the great he emerges from the violent world of Boyer.

377
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:16.920
Boilers are the nobles.

378
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.630
Yonkers are the Prussian Nobles,

379
00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:19.160
boy,

380
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:19.561
ours,

381
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:24.060
boy ar are the Russian Knowles and royal politics.

382
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.210
Peter was the first child of his father's second wife,

383
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:32.570
and thus a potential threat to the ambition of the relatives of the first wife,

384
00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:33.901
uh,

385
00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:38.070
his mother and her allies among the boy that is the nobles over through the

386
00:09:38.071 --> 00:09:39.750
regions in 16,

387
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:40.140
uh,

388
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.190
89,

389
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:41.551
uh,

390
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:46.551
Peters rule is from 1682 till his death in 1725.

391
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.061
Uh,

392
00:09:48.061 --> 00:09:52.140
there were no strict rules for the succession of the Tsar.

393
00:09:52.141 --> 00:09:57.030
It's basically just kind of a family [inaudible] family battle royal,

394
00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:57.750
uh,

395
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:58.500
in which,

396
00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:58.711
uh,

397
00:09:58.711 --> 00:10:03.711
there were bloody a settling of scores and there was no foreign minister.

398
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.400
Uh,

399
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.720
the boy are counsel.

400
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.350
That is the council of the nobles literally met in the throne,

401
00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:10.810
uh,

402
00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:12.210
of the palace.

403
00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:12.680
Uh,

404
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.520
and it became known as the Duma.

405
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.560
Eventually in 1905,

406
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:17.430
uh,

407
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.911
Nicholas,

408
00:10:17.911 --> 00:10:18.740
the second,

409
00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.021
uh,

410
00:10:19.021 --> 00:10:20.490
will be forced to,

411
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:20.720
uh,

412
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.460
to grant a Duma a,

413
00:10:22.461 --> 00:10:23.880
an assembly to Russia.

414
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:24.750
And then he withdraws,

415
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.700
eliminates basically all of its rights.

416
00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:27.521
And then the doom,

417
00:10:27.521 --> 00:10:28.530
of course we'll come back,

418
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:29.270
uh,

419
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:29.750
uh,

420
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.950
uh,

421
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:30.151
uh,

422
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:31.830
later on now,

423
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.340
uh,

424
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:37.340
Peter is one of those cases in European history where the one person's

425
00:10:37.381 --> 00:10:42.270
personality and interest does make an enormous difference because he is an

426
00:10:42.271 --> 00:10:43.290
absolute ruler.

427
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.360
He can do what he damn well pleases.

428
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.660
And he is personally responsible for the reforms.

429
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.230
Uh,

430
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.620
the opening up of Russia to a considerable extent to,

431
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:53.430
uh,

432
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.060
uh,

433
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.530
to European ideas,

434
00:10:55.531 --> 00:10:56.820
to western European ideas.

435
00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.480
This is something that he does himself as a boy.

436
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.960
He was at very smart and he was very interested in science.

437
00:11:03.961 --> 00:11:06.060
He wanted to know always how things work.

438
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.290
He was fascinated with astrolabes and,

439
00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:09.660
uh,

440
00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.070
was interested in sailing.

441
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:12.870
Now Russia doesn't have a port.

442
00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:13.440
Uh,

443
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.240
so he's interested in sailing,

444
00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:16.520
learns about sailing on,

445
00:11:16.521 --> 00:11:16.741
on,

446
00:11:16.741 --> 00:11:19.590
on lakes and ponds and rivers.

447
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:20.070
Uh,

448
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:20.791
it does have a port,

449
00:11:20.791 --> 00:11:22.980
but it's frozen in with frozen all the time.

450
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:23.760
Um,

451
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.760
but his travels took them into contact with observatories,

452
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.571
museums,

453
00:11:27.571 --> 00:11:28.410
hospitals,

454
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.700
botanical gardens.

455
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:30.241
When he goes,

456
00:11:30.241 --> 00:11:31.410
he's fascinated by gardens.

457
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:32.640
When he goes to Europe,

458
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:33.180
uh,

459
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:33.840
on his,

460
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.850
on his big salty on his big,

461
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.950
big boy trek through Europe.

462
00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:39.780
And he goes around and he visited visits,

463
00:11:39.781 --> 00:11:40.231
all of these,

464
00:11:40.231 --> 00:11:40.381
you know,

465
00:11:40.381 --> 00:11:42.600
botanical gardens and he sketches things.

466
00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:45.090
He's constantly sketching the way things work,

467
00:11:45.091 --> 00:11:46.260
the way things are.

468
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:51.210
He had an intellectual curiosity that really defied the kind of Orthodox,

469
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.380
religious,

470
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.260
uh,

471
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.380
a skepticism about any kind of rational belief.

472
00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:56.531
I mean,

473
00:11:56.531 --> 00:11:57.121
this permeated,

474
00:11:57.121 --> 00:11:58.750
and not only the Russian Orthodox church,

475
00:11:58.990 --> 00:11:59.890
but appear meets,

476
00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:00.570
uh,

477
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:00.730
uh,

478
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:02.020
the Catholic church as well.

479
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:02.261
I mean,

480
00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:03.640
look what happens to Galileo,

481
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:04.420
uh,

482
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:04.861
who,

483
00:12:04.861 --> 00:12:05.230
uh,

484
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:05.560
you know,

485
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.170
who was lucky not to have been burned at the stake,

486
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:08.470
uh,

487
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.850
by,

488
00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:10.660
by his friend of the pope.

489
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:16.590
And he was interested in math and in geography and thus in maps and map making.

490
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.043
Um,

491
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:25.350
and when he does is he takes this archaic state structure in which literally

492
00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:27.730
nothing had been written down.

493
00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:28.841
It's all just,

494
00:12:28.841 --> 00:12:29.200
you know,

495
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.210
passed down from word to mouth.

496
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:32.101
He transforms,

497
00:12:32.101 --> 00:12:37.101
it transforms Russia into a European absolute monarchy with much in common with

498
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.800
Frederick the great with Sweden,

499
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.191
uh,

500
00:12:42.191 --> 00:12:42.881
with Austria,

501
00:12:42.881 --> 00:12:43.280
Austria,

502
00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.113
the Habsburgs,

503
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:44.680
uh,

504
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.960
with Spain and with,

505
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:47.440
with,

506
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.340
with France.

507
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:49.210
Um,

508
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:50.043
he,

509
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.250
he tries a,

510
00:12:51.251 --> 00:12:53.740
not only to copy European absolutism,

511
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.980
but to open up Russia to commerce,

512
00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:02.130
realizing that trade met wealth and that wealth met improvements in the lives of

513
00:13:04.601 --> 00:13:05.680
the Russian people.

514
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.780
More about that in a while.

515
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:08.170
Uh,

516
00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.550
so he makes Russia,

517
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:10.130
uh,

518
00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:11.530
a military,

519
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:11.801
uh,

520
00:13:11.801 --> 00:13:12.770
power indeed,

521
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.500
arguably a modern military power,

522
00:13:14.501 --> 00:13:15.000
at least in the,

523
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.930
in the 17th and early 18th century.

524
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:17.890
Um,

525
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:18.270
uh,

526
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.730
sansony injects European culture in to,

527
00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:22.330
uh,

528
00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:23.650
into Russia now.

529
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:24.880
Just as an aside,

530
00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:25.420
but it's wonderful.

531
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.171
We'll come back to a,

532
00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:27.250
particularly in your reading,

533
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:32.490
the tension in Russia between an absolute repugnance for Western influence.

534
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.330
Uh,

535
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:33.480
and,

536
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:33.911
and the,

537
00:13:33.911 --> 00:13:34.061
the,

538
00:13:34.061 --> 00:13:37.690
the assert under the assertion constant assertion that that Russia traditional

539
00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:40.630
ways of doing things are the right way of doing things.

540
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.750
I long identified with people who would be called Slavo.

541
00:13:43.751 --> 00:13:44.584
Phil's,

542
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:45.430
uh,

543
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.610
their tensions with Westernized.

544
00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:52.650
Hers would last right through Russian intellectual history in the 19th century.

545
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:54.370
I remember when I was,

546
00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:54.580
you know,

547
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.610
a student of one of the biggest classes at the University of Michigan go blue.

548
00:13:57.611 --> 00:13:58.660
I'm so sad this weekend.

549
00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:59.340
Uh,

550
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.860
it was Russian intellectual history and we would read the Slava fuels and we'd

551
00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:04.140
read the Western icers.

552
00:14:04.141 --> 00:14:04.660
Uh,

553
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.160
of course taught by the late Russian,

554
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:07.880
a restaurant of scholar of Russia.

555
00:14:07.881 --> 00:14:08.290
Uh,

556
00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:09.101
Arthur Mendel.

557
00:14:09.101 --> 00:14:11.650
And it was fabulous to read these people as they debated,

558
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.041
you know,

559
00:14:12.041 --> 00:14:13.480
what will happen to Russia,

560
00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.120
the kind of Western icers and those in between.

561
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:16.930
And a lot of them,

562
00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:20.470
they were writing from Paris in the 19th century in some of them were just

563
00:14:20.471 --> 00:14:20.741
great,

564
00:14:20.741 --> 00:14:23.080
great writers and was just kind of intellectual energy.

565
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.960
But it came down to this theme that's still is so important,

566
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:26.380
uh,

567
00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.640
was already so important,

568
00:14:27.641 --> 00:14:32.410
is that what is Russian that should be kept uniquely Russian and closed outside

569
00:14:32.411 --> 00:14:33.190
influence.

570
00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:38.190
And what is Russian that should be modified by being open to non religious

571
00:14:39.041 --> 00:14:41.590
influences that come from other places.

572
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.340
And this is not just a uniquely Russian tail as obviously,

573
00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:45.670
uh,

574
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:49.030
you can see now what about Peter Himself?

575
00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:49.930
He was,

576
00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:52.880
we figured that somebody figured out at least six foot seven.

577
00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:54.530
Now that's just huge.

578
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.810
That's tiny in the NBA now,

579
00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.630
but six points that the guards,

580
00:14:59.631 --> 00:14:59.771
the,

581
00:14:59.771 --> 00:14:59.951
the,

582
00:14:59.951 --> 00:15:01.070
the sort of giants,

583
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.330
they were called who garden,

584
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.270
uh,

585
00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:03.710
uh,

586
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:04.730
Frederick the great,

587
00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.670
we're giants because there were six feet tall.

588
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.760
The average person was about 5.3,

589
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.161
uh,

590
00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:12.290
five feet,

591
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:13.370
three inches,

592
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:14.000
five,

593
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:14.930
four in,

594
00:15:14.931 --> 00:15:15.291
in,

595
00:15:15.291 --> 00:15:15.681
in,

596
00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:16.100
uh,

597
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:16.933
in France.

598
00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.740
Napoleon was always considered to be kind of a,

599
00:15:18.741 --> 00:15:18.951
you know,

600
00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:19.621
a dwarf,

601
00:15:19.621 --> 00:15:20.450
a midget,

602
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:20.631
uh,

603
00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:21.380
really was about the,

604
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.340
he wasn't at all,

605
00:15:22.341 --> 00:15:23.660
he was just sort of regional corpulent,

606
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:26.840
but he was the average kind of increasingly corporate and he was the average

607
00:15:26.841 --> 00:15:29.150
height of most people in France.

608
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:33.320
So in a Peter the Great was a big guy,

609
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:34.790
six foot seven.

610
00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:35.300
Uh,

611
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.490
he had extremely small hands,

612
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.140
very small feet,

613
00:15:39.141 --> 00:15:40.970
which meant he sort of lurched,

614
00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:41.720
uh,

615
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.320
and stumbled sometimes when he walked quickly cause he drank just enormous

616
00:15:45.321 --> 00:15:46.154
quantities.

617
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:49.460
And he had these odd kind of facial tics that he couldn't,

618
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.410
he couldn't really help at all.

619
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:51.600
Uh,

620
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.250
we there,

621
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.090
we don't have,

622
00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:53.690
you know,

623
00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:54.620
we don't have a,

624
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:55.070
uh,

625
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.640
documentary showing Peter the great inaction for obvious,

626
00:15:58.830 --> 00:15:59.320
uh,

627
00:15:59.320 --> 00:15:59.930
um,

628
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:00.230
uh,

629
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.220
obvious reasons.

630
00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.720
But the people that he visited,

631
00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:03.100
I,

632
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.740
when he was snatching a huge roasts off the table at,

633
00:16:05.741 --> 00:16:07.280
at the fancy parties in,

634
00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:07.910
uh,

635
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:08.743
in London,

636
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:08.871
uh,

637
00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:12.800
commented on these sort of facial tics that he had that would bend his face.

638
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.060
And he had a misshapen,

639
00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:14.690
uh,

640
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:14.841
uh,

641
00:16:14.841 --> 00:16:15.710
lower lip.

642
00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:16.693
Um,

643
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:21.530
and his t his head sometimes when he was talking with would seem convulsed to

644
00:16:21.531 --> 00:16:22.011
the right.

645
00:16:22.011 --> 00:16:23.630
It would kind of move to the right all the time.

646
00:16:23.631 --> 00:16:25.070
And he was so much bigger than everybody else.

647
00:16:25.071 --> 00:16:26.420
And so people really were,

648
00:16:26.421 --> 00:16:26.751
were,

649
00:16:26.751 --> 00:16:27.200
uh,

650
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:27.411
uh,

651
00:16:27.411 --> 00:16:28.430
not taken aback.

652
00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:28.730
I,

653
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.080
because this was a time when,

654
00:16:30.081 --> 00:16:30.291
when,

655
00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:30.590
when,

656
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:31.010
when,

657
00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:31.251
when,

658
00:16:31.251 --> 00:16:33.890
when physical imperfections,

659
00:16:33.891 --> 00:16:34.071
we're,

660
00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:34.461
we're,

661
00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:35.050
we're,

662
00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:35.610
uh,

663
00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:36.050
uh,

664
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.271
we're,

665
00:16:36.271 --> 00:16:36.441
we're,

666
00:16:36.441 --> 00:16:37.191
we're commonplace.

667
00:16:37.191 --> 00:16:37.341
I mean,

668
00:16:37.341 --> 00:16:39.860
you couldn't go anywhere without seeing people who,

669
00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:40.760
uh,

670
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:41.290
who,

671
00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:42.560
who nature had given a,

672
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.530
in many ways a very bad deal along with crushing poverty.

673
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:45.950
Uh,

674
00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:47.470
but the fact that Peter was a czar and,

675
00:16:47.471 --> 00:16:47.581
and,

676
00:16:47.581 --> 00:16:47.881
and,

677
00:16:47.881 --> 00:16:48.200
and,

678
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.130
and was rather scary in his temperament because he had a rather bad temper,

679
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:52.940
uh,

680
00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:53.241
uh,

681
00:16:53.241 --> 00:16:53.870
to,

682
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:54.021
uh,

683
00:16:54.021 --> 00:16:54.380
method.

684
00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:55.213
He could be,

685
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:56.780
he could be alarm,

686
00:16:56.781 --> 00:16:57.890
he could be scary.

687
00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.080
His cruelty,

688
00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:00.380
generosity was legend,

689
00:17:00.381 --> 00:17:01.520
but so has this cruelty,

690
00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:02.330
uh,

691
00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:06.890
several times at public executions in 1698 and 1699,

692
00:17:06.891 --> 00:17:09.160
he brushed the executioner away,

693
00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:10.100
grabbed the accident,

694
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:15.160
did the dirty work himself chopping off a ahead or two a night.

695
00:17:15.231 --> 00:17:15.861
In 17,

696
00:17:15.861 --> 00:17:16.311
18,

697
00:17:16.311 --> 00:17:17.210
he ordered a man,

698
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.900
uh,

699
00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:18.021
uh,

700
00:17:18.021 --> 00:17:20.300
kept alive after being horribly tortured.

701
00:17:20.301 --> 00:17:22.220
So he could be a tortured,

702
00:17:22.221 --> 00:17:25.850
some more and suffer as long as humanly possible.

703
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:26.480
Uh,

704
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.710
all officials,

705
00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.221
uh,

706
00:17:28.221 --> 00:17:28.491
in,

707
00:17:28.491 --> 00:17:33.290
from the chancelleries that he had created and all of the officers were obliged

708
00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:38.291
to attend this torture scene as a way of kind of warning them that,

709
00:17:39.441 --> 00:17:39.950
uh,

710
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:40.670
you know,

711
00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:41.930
you better not mess around.

712
00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:42.741
Now remember,

713
00:17:42.741 --> 00:17:44.630
this is a time as we'll see in a while where,

714
00:17:44.631 --> 00:17:44.840
you know,

715
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.260
the czar was on the road a lot and distances in the Russian empire where are

716
00:17:48.261 --> 00:17:49.094
enormous.

717
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.920
And when he is gone from a Moscow and Saint Petersburg,

718
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.770
there was always this tendency to have these sort of cabal.

719
00:17:55.771 --> 00:17:56.040
I mean,

720
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.700
they kind of get together and sort of plot and his son has the bad idea of

721
00:17:59.701 --> 00:18:02.820
getting involved in this later as we shall see.

722
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.340
Yet there were incidents that his merciful side,

723
00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:05.990
uh,

724
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.240
uh,

725
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.310
came through as well.

726
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.050
But when it came to treason,

727
00:18:10.051 --> 00:18:14.130
he was less likely to be a merciful as the case of Alexi,

728
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.710
his ill fated son would,

729
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:17.730
would demonstrate.

730
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:18.391
Now,

731
00:18:18.391 --> 00:18:18.691
Peter,

732
00:18:18.691 --> 00:18:21.580
the great one thing is clear his head,

733
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:26.600
an enormous ambivalence about his role and his image as a czar.

734
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:32.690
His second wife was a Latvian peasant made and this horrified the boy are the

735
00:18:33.961 --> 00:18:34.701
Boyers who,

736
00:18:34.701 --> 00:18:36.350
who thought that this was just,

737
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.770
it was unbecoming.

738
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.870
How can you marry a,

739
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.030
a Latvian to begin with if you were Russian and Mary,

740
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:42.241
uh,

741
00:18:42.241 --> 00:18:42.960
somebody,

742
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.320
uh,

743
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.300
who was a commoner,

744
00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:45.810
um,

745
00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.810
he was capable and they're a lot of paintings of him dressing up and playing

746
00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:49.011
the,

747
00:18:49.011 --> 00:18:49.430
the,

748
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:50.430
the role of a,

749
00:18:50.431 --> 00:18:51.370
of a czar,

750
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.140
uh,

751
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:52.321
you know,

752
00:18:52.321 --> 00:18:53.730
dressing in fancy clothes,

753
00:18:53.731 --> 00:18:54.210
but there's,

754
00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:59.210
but they're more images of him identified with horribly worn boots with his toe

755
00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:04.050
sometimes sneaking through at the end that seem to reflect his great personal

756
00:19:04.051 --> 00:19:04.884
thrift,

757
00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:05.370
uh,

758
00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:06.420
wearing stockings.

759
00:19:06.421 --> 00:19:08.640
It was said that he darned himself,

760
00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:09.420
uh,

761
00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:13.260
and a battered hat that he kept on wearing that he had worn at the battle of

762
00:19:13.261 --> 00:19:18.261
Poltava in 1709 complete with a bullet hole that's supposedly tore through it.

763
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.573
I'm missing,

764
00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:20.821
uh,

765
00:19:20.821 --> 00:19:21.480
his,

766
00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:21.960
uh,

767
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.793
head.

768
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.400
Um,

769
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.860
he liked the company of ordinary people.

770
00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:26.600
Uh,

771
00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.170
and this was a constant trait.

772
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:28.830
Uh,

773
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:33.450
he identified himself with the Russian people and more about this in a while.

774
00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.160
He avoided carriages.

775
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:36.900
He liked to walk.

776
00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:42.090
He would leave the carers behind dismissing carriage drivers who are more well

777
00:19:42.091 --> 00:19:43.590
dressed than he was.

778
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.000
And his guards,

779
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.280
he had ignored carefully,

780
00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.490
uh,

781
00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.510
crafted seating plans at dinner.

782
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:54.060
He jumped from table to table eating,

783
00:19:54.061 --> 00:19:54.781
standing up.

784
00:19:54.781 --> 00:19:56.370
He didn't like to sit down very much.

785
00:19:56.371 --> 00:19:59.460
His back hurt or walking around,

786
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:00.031
he didn't like,

787
00:20:00.031 --> 00:20:02.580
he couldn't stay still a very long,

788
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.270
um,

789
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:04.290
when he was lodged,

790
00:20:04.291 --> 00:20:06.510
he liked living in your basic,

791
00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.690
a Russian wouldn't peasant house,

792
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:10.230
uh,

793
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:13.140
such as you could find on the outskirts of Moscow.

794
00:20:13.141 --> 00:20:16.110
One of the things that's very true about Moscow right into the 20th century is

795
00:20:16.111 --> 00:20:19.920
that you'd all sorts of peasants living in the edge of Moscow living in these,

796
00:20:19.921 --> 00:20:20.281
these,

797
00:20:20.281 --> 00:20:20.690
uh,

798
00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:21.150
uh,

799
00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.050
these wooden houses.

800
00:20:22.051 --> 00:20:22.890
And he liked that.

801
00:20:22.891 --> 00:20:24.090
He said he slept well in the,

802
00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.380
in these wooden houses.

803
00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:26.400
Um,

804
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.430
and that probably is because of a very unhappy childhood,

805
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:33.630
listening to relative shouting each other and plotting to kill each other,

806
00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:34.230
uh,

807
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:35.640
in the big house.

808
00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:36.660
Um,

809
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.493
so,

810
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:38.760
um,

811
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:38.970
and,

812
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:40.290
and he never liked Moscow.

813
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.000
And we'll see more about that in a minute,

814
00:20:42.001 --> 00:20:44.760
in part because of its overwhelming religious influence.

815
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.550
And that's one reason why he builds besides the quest for report,

816
00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:49.300
uh,

817
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:49.700
on the,

818
00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:50.500
the sea,

819
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.630
why he builds a Saint Petersburg.

820
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:53.710
Um,

821
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:54.400
he,

822
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.750
when travelling abroad,

823
00:20:55.751 --> 00:21:00.730
he refused the fancy lodgings that were left for a reserve for such a

824
00:21:00.731 --> 00:21:01.564
distinguished,

825
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:01.781
uh,

826
00:21:01.781 --> 00:21:03.130
visitors in 17,

827
00:21:03.131 --> 00:21:03.964
17,

828
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:04.331
uh,

829
00:21:04.331 --> 00:21:05.140
in Paris,

830
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:05.650
uh,

831
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:05.890
uh,

832
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:09.880
Lindsay who's reports he went to a private house instead of the Louvre,

833
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.110
the Louvre,

834
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:11.860
the museum had a big,

835
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:12.720
uh,

836
00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.090
uh,

837
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:13.780
palace,

838
00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:14.770
which as I said before is,

839
00:21:14.771 --> 00:21:15.790
where were the small boy,

840
00:21:15.791 --> 00:21:16.571
Louis the 14th,

841
00:21:16.571 --> 00:21:17.230
lived.

842
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:17.830
Uh,

843
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:18.610
and then,

844
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:19.360
um,

845
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.181
then it was burned in,

846
00:21:20.181 --> 00:21:21.550
in 1871.

847
00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:22.091
Uh,

848
00:21:22.091 --> 00:21:23.290
and so he,

849
00:21:23.291 --> 00:21:23.711
instead,

850
00:21:23.711 --> 00:21:27.160
he just went to and rented a private house and fell asleep almost immediately.

851
00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:28.180
Um,

852
00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.770
he loves sleeping on ships.

853
00:21:29.771 --> 00:21:30.760
He said he thought that the,

854
00:21:30.761 --> 00:21:31.230
that the,

855
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:33.940
that the rocking of the waves rocked him to sleep.

856
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.170
And so he liked doing that.

857
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.840
Legend has him eating peasant food,

858
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.100
cabbage soup,

859
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.113
porridge,

860
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:40.840
uh,

861
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.470
uh,

862
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:42.190
meet,

863
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:42.521
uh,

864
00:21:42.521 --> 00:21:42.880
with,

865
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.090
uh,

866
00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:44.260
pickled cucumbers,

867
00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.720
ham and cheese and crevasse,

868
00:21:46.721 --> 00:21:51.721
which is a drink which have actually tasted from a fermented black bread.

869
00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:52.301
Uh,

870
00:21:52.301 --> 00:21:54.850
but he was not indifferent to a foreign food.

871
00:21:54.851 --> 00:21:55.730
There was somebody found a,

872
00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:56.321
an order,

873
00:21:56.321 --> 00:21:59.320
he ordered 200 bottles of Irmi Taj wine.

874
00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:04.300
Irmi Taj has a really wonderful now just horribly overpriced wine from the home

875
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.520
on the Left Bank of the,

876
00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:06.363
of the home,

877
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.930
not very far away from where we live,

878
00:22:07.931 --> 00:22:09.010
but it's totally out of price.

879
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.690
But Army Taj was a wine that was,

880
00:22:10.691 --> 00:22:13.960
was known by Connoisseur in the 17th and 18th century.

881
00:22:13.961 --> 00:22:14.081
And,

882
00:22:14.081 --> 00:22:15.070
and ever since then,

883
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:16.090
and so,

884
00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:16.271
you know,

885
00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:17.410
for all the talk about eating,

886
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:17.681
you know,

887
00:22:17.681 --> 00:22:18.620
eating cabbage and,

888
00:22:18.621 --> 00:22:18.821
and,

889
00:22:18.821 --> 00:22:19.251
and he didn't,

890
00:22:19.251 --> 00:22:19.721
we were in a hurry.

891
00:22:19.721 --> 00:22:20.350
People,

892
00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:20.501
uh,

893
00:22:20.501 --> 00:22:21.041
even then,

894
00:22:21.041 --> 00:22:21.490
uh,

895
00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:21.790
uh,

896
00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:23.740
earned Ritaj costs a lot of money and,

897
00:22:23.741 --> 00:22:24.341
and he,

898
00:22:24.341 --> 00:22:24.700
uh,

899
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:24.911
you know,

900
00:22:24.911 --> 00:22:27.070
he ordered 200 good bottles of army Taj wine.

901
00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:27.701
So,

902
00:22:27.701 --> 00:22:28.060
uh,

903
00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:28.450
what else?

904
00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:29.980
I wish I had been invited to these things.

905
00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:31.060
Um,

906
00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.220
he was very informal.

907
00:22:33.221 --> 00:22:33.431
I mean,

908
00:22:33.431 --> 00:22:36.730
he said that his legend that he just sort of grabbed these huge chunks of meat

909
00:22:36.731 --> 00:22:38.710
and start gnawing on them like you would on a,

910
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:39.520
on a,

911
00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.490
on a hot dog or something like that at a Yankee game.

912
00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.120
Uh,

913
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.690
except that these other people were already dressed up and then the,

914
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:46.071
in the,

915
00:22:46.071 --> 00:22:49.680
in the meat and the gravy was flying over them as he just sort of walked around

916
00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:50.680
knowing on this stuff.

917
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:51.700
Um,

918
00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:52.331
Sophia,

919
00:22:52.331 --> 00:22:52.871
Sophia,

920
00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:54.400
a Charlotte of Grunenberg.

921
00:22:54.401 --> 00:22:55.600
I don't know the hell that is,

922
00:22:55.601 --> 00:22:55.771
but,

923
00:22:55.771 --> 00:22:57.040
but it's got to be some,

924
00:22:57.041 --> 00:22:57.401
some,

925
00:22:57.401 --> 00:22:57.700
uh,

926
00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:02.320
royal hanger on row that is evident that he has not been taught how to eat

927
00:23:02.321 --> 00:23:03.154
properly,

928
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:06.550
but she liked his natural manner and informality.

929
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:07.180
Uh,

930
00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:07.661
the king,

931
00:23:07.661 --> 00:23:11.950
King Frederick of Denmark found him ill mannered and inappropriate.

932
00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:13.150
Um,

933
00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:14.950
he liked to masquerade,

934
00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:15.671
and again,

935
00:23:15.671 --> 00:23:20.671
this is his personal ambivalence about his own role hanging around with were

936
00:23:21.341 --> 00:23:23.620
ordinary people sleeping in,

937
00:23:23.621 --> 00:23:23.811
in,

938
00:23:23.811 --> 00:23:24.021
in,

939
00:23:24.021 --> 00:23:27.010
in peasant logics and that sort of thing.

940
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:27.761
He,

941
00:23:27.761 --> 00:23:28.594
um,

942
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:33.730
he liked to dress up as a sailor and one thing that he always did when he went

943
00:23:33.731 --> 00:23:37.900
on his grand tour is he always took fake names as if he was,

944
00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:38.710
you know,

945
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:40.680
signing in into a hotel.

946
00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:40.901
As,

947
00:23:40.901 --> 00:23:41.410
you know,

948
00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:43.210
Mr and Mrs. Jones Smith,

949
00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:47.480
he would take the name of a commoner and we just assign him to a hotel.

950
00:23:47.481 --> 00:23:47.660
You know,

951
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:48.740
Peter the great or whatever,

952
00:23:48.741 --> 00:23:49.061
but he would,

953
00:23:49.061 --> 00:23:49.430
he would,

954
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.770
he would go in with a name that wasn't his,

955
00:23:51.771 --> 00:23:52.101
and again,

956
00:23:52.101 --> 00:23:57.101
this is just his personal ambivalence about who he was and his uncertainty about

957
00:23:57.561 --> 00:23:58.394
the role,

958
00:23:58.670 --> 00:23:59.121
uh,

959
00:23:59.121 --> 00:23:59.391
you know,

960
00:23:59.391 --> 00:24:01.100
of that he had in his own,

961
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.410
in his own family yet.

962
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:07.130
And so this was a play acting that was part of his,

963
00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.150
his life.

964
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:11.110
These ornate masquerades and charades that,

965
00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:11.440
that,

966
00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.410
that are part of his,

967
00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:13.850
his complexity,

968
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:14.510
uh,

969
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:16.220
reveal something about his identity.

970
00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:16.990
Then when you see these,

971
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:17.811
these portraits of him,

972
00:24:17.811 --> 00:24:20.210
he looks for a czar like he looks like when these royal,

973
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:20.870
you know,

974
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:21.800
per people that,

975
00:24:21.801 --> 00:24:22.110
that,

976
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:22.311
that,

977
00:24:22.311 --> 00:24:24.950
that were painted all the time in 60,

978
00:24:24.951 --> 00:24:25.581
97,

979
00:24:25.581 --> 00:24:28.970
he goes west with the name of Peter Mci loss.

980
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:29.600
Um,

981
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.520
and even in his own account books,

982
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:34.790
which he kept very carefully about how much money he had spent because he

983
00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:35.420
wasn't,

984
00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:35.721
he wasn't,

985
00:24:35.721 --> 00:24:36.650
it wasn't a cheapskate,

986
00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:37.101
but he,

987
00:24:37.101 --> 00:24:37.850
but he really,

988
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:38.240
you know,

989
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.680
he paid attention to,

990
00:24:39.681 --> 00:24:39.921
to,

991
00:24:39.921 --> 00:24:40.880
to expenses,

992
00:24:40.881 --> 00:24:41.960
to royal expenses,

993
00:24:41.961 --> 00:24:42.890
personal expenses.

994
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:48.100
He refers to himself with a variety of names and titles as captain this kernel,

995
00:24:49.341 --> 00:24:51.050
that general that,

996
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:52.270
uh,

997
00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:52.730
and he's not,

998
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:54.320
he's not trying to hide his identity.

999
00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:54.831
The future.

1000
00:24:54.831 --> 00:24:57.740
It was very obvious to see who he was is hey hand rising,

1001
00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.930
handwriting recognized by experts,

1002
00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:02.570
but roleplaying takes on dimensions of the state.

1003
00:25:02.571 --> 00:25:03.021
I mentioned,

1004
00:25:03.021 --> 00:25:06.440
I don't remember what context the other day that the most famous example is the

1005
00:25:06.441 --> 00:25:07.670
drunk in assembly.

1006
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:11.990
It's sort of a mock parallel government with his buddies.

1007
00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:12.590
It has,

1008
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.700
uh,

1009
00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:13.010
you know,

1010
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:14.510
personnel who are his buddies,

1011
00:25:14.511 --> 00:25:15.500
those in favor,

1012
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:16.670
lots of eating,

1013
00:25:16.671 --> 00:25:17.151
drinking,

1014
00:25:17.151 --> 00:25:17.984
et cetera.

1015
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.710
Uh,

1016
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.130
it has its statutes,

1017
00:25:20.131 --> 00:25:24.950
does this sort of mock constitution and its rituals that involve basically

1018
00:25:24.951 --> 00:25:25.371
getting,

1019
00:25:25.371 --> 00:25:25.551
you know,

1020
00:25:25.551 --> 00:25:26.384
getting wasted.

1021
00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.410
Um,

1022
00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:27.741
again,

1023
00:25:27.741 --> 00:25:31.820
this is part of a split personality about who he,

1024
00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.400
who he was and if he was correct.

1025
00:25:34.401 --> 00:25:34.581
I mean,

1026
00:25:34.581 --> 00:25:39.350
this is part of him saying that being a czar is more than just dressing up and

1027
00:25:39.351 --> 00:25:44.351
playing the role and going to fancy dances and hanging around with fancy people

1028
00:25:44.691 --> 00:25:46.100
who don't do a damn thing,

1029
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:47.090
uh,

1030
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:48.380
that you have to do the work,

1031
00:25:48.381 --> 00:25:49.640
you have to walk the walk.

1032
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:50.460
Uh,

1033
00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.760
and that he did and that you had to manifest strength and firmness and brave

1034
00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:59.770
bravery and worthy deeds that would be recognized as being real deeds by

1035
00:26:00.891 --> 00:26:02.030
contemporaries.

1036
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:04.670
And he constantly wants his son who was kind of a narrative.

1037
00:26:04.671 --> 00:26:05.720
Well that,

1038
00:26:05.721 --> 00:26:05.871
you know,

1039
00:26:05.871 --> 00:26:06.980
you better work harder,

1040
00:26:06.981 --> 00:26:07.371
you better,

1041
00:26:07.371 --> 00:26:07.560
you know,

1042
00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:09.770
working a little harder to pay more attention to what you're doing.

1043
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:12.830
You've been or care about military things more than you do.

1044
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:14.210
This is what I'm telling you.

1045
00:26:14.211 --> 00:26:15.050
You better do.

1046
00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.970
You better listen to what I'm doing.

1047
00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:18.283
Um,

1048
00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.220
but sometimes he just,

1049
00:26:19.221 --> 00:26:19.401
you know,

1050
00:26:19.401 --> 00:26:19.791
he needed,

1051
00:26:19.791 --> 00:26:23.180
he would drink a lot in Eli cause he just needed to relax.

1052
00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:23.331
I mean,

1053
00:26:23.331 --> 00:26:24.800
being a czar was a busy job.

1054
00:26:24.801 --> 00:26:26.030
He got up at four in the morning.

1055
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:28.730
He was at his office for anybody else was.

1056
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:29.721
And people began,

1057
00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:32.470
like in any business to be a 10th tended to,

1058
00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:32.990
you know,

1059
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:34.220
am I there early enough?

1060
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:34.930
You know,

1061
00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:38.870
did he see me that I am still here when it's getting dark,

1062
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:40.430
of course it gets dark in the winter,

1063
00:26:40.431 --> 00:26:40.671
you know,

1064
00:26:40.671 --> 00:26:40.830
in,

1065
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:41.081
in,

1066
00:26:41.081 --> 00:26:42.290
in Saint Petersburg about,

1067
00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:42.830
uh,

1068
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:43.530
you about,

1069
00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:44.010
about noon,

1070
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:44.843
about noon.

1071
00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:45.600
Uh,

1072
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.433
but anyway,

1073
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.640
but he loved practical things.

1074
00:26:47.641 --> 00:26:48.680
He loved firefighting.

1075
00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.620
For example,

1076
00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:50.470
uh,

1077
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:52.080
he had a passion for fireworks,

1078
00:26:52.081 --> 00:26:52.920
explosives,

1079
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:54.870
cannon fire drums.

1080
00:26:54.871 --> 00:26:55.770
He played the drums.

1081
00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.040
He loved dancing and he loved religious thinking.

1082
00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:03.000
He lived this sort of choir music of Russian Orthodox,

1083
00:27:03.001 --> 00:27:03.510
uh,

1084
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:04.020
uh,

1085
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:04.800
services.

1086
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.010
He loved to play chess and he loved to play billiards.

1087
00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:08.670
Uh,

1088
00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:09.750
and as I already said,

1089
00:27:09.751 --> 00:27:12.210
he loved mathematical instruments and telescopes.

1090
00:27:12.211 --> 00:27:14.160
He carried a telescope with him wherever he went,

1091
00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.980
and he knew how to use it and he knew what he was looking for.

1092
00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:17.610
Uh,

1093
00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:18.810
and he loved Globes.

1094
00:27:18.811 --> 00:27:21.060
He loved to see where things were he liked.

1095
00:27:21.061 --> 00:27:22.260
He liked to see that we,

1096
00:27:22.261 --> 00:27:25.770
that they map parts of Siberia that people didn't know what was there.

1097
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.520
It was rather like parts of Africa before the 1880s,

1098
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:32.130
just these big sort of blanks because nobody had ever been there.

1099
00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:32.880
Um,

1100
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.140
and he was interested in that.

1101
00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:34.950
Um,

1102
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:36.240
he was self taught.

1103
00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:37.000
Uh,

1104
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:37.411
he didn't,

1105
00:27:37.411 --> 00:27:39.960
you didn't have to go to some fancy school if you were a czar,

1106
00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:40.590
you know,

1107
00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:40.950
uh,

1108
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:42.210
to be a czar in training.

1109
00:27:42.211 --> 00:27:43.021
You had tutors.

1110
00:27:43.021 --> 00:27:44.250
There's all these folks did.

1111
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.060
Um,

1112
00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:45.390
but,

1113
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:46.223
uh,

1114
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:48.060
but any made spelling mistakes,

1115
00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:48.751
which you can see.

1116
00:27:48.751 --> 00:27:49.471
I don't read Russian,

1117
00:27:49.471 --> 00:27:53.550
but he made spelling mistakes when he wrote his handwriting was awful and bad

1118
00:27:53.551 --> 00:27:55.940
handwriting as is the nemesis of,

1119
00:27:55.941 --> 00:27:56.111
of,

1120
00:27:56.111 --> 00:27:57.000
of historians,

1121
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.361
uh,

1122
00:27:57.361 --> 00:27:58.200
to be sure.

1123
00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:02.400
But he built a private library and it wasn't just full of religious books.

1124
00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:05.340
It was a practical books about fortifications,

1125
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.121
hydraulics,

1126
00:28:06.121 --> 00:28:09.630
artillery navigation and ship building.

1127
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.570
But he also said he sang religious music.

1128
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:16.590
He had many religious books to kind of standard liturgical texts that were the

1129
00:28:16.591 --> 00:28:17.131
stuff of,

1130
00:28:17.131 --> 00:28:17.401
of,

1131
00:28:17.401 --> 00:28:17.910
uh,

1132
00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:18.511
of a,

1133
00:28:18.511 --> 00:28:23.511
of religious enthusiasm and more modern theological theological works,

1134
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:24.240
uh,

1135
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.400
in the Russian Orthodox,

1136
00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:27.000
uh,

1137
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:27.990
a tradition.

1138
00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:33.270
Another point about this sort of ambivalence about being czar is that he often

1139
00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:38.130
made a point of choosing his most trusted advisors from the ranks of commoners,

1140
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:39.030
uh,

1141
00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:41.790
and gave them the right to become titled,

1142
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:42.540
uh,

1143
00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:46.140
after a certain amount of time in the royal bureaucracy.

1144
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:48.870
But sometimes he had a tendency to pick people whom you liked a lot,

1145
00:28:48.871 --> 00:28:50.220
but we're totally unqualified.

1146
00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:53.400
Miller military commanders who weren't,

1147
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:54.751
who weren't,

1148
00:28:54.751 --> 00:28:55.140
um,

1149
00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.070
you weren't very good,

1150
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.610
but you know what,

1151
00:28:57.611 --> 00:28:58.444
what he,

1152
00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:03.560
what he does is he cuts off Russian absolutism from this,

1153
00:29:03.901 --> 00:29:05.880
this totally religious,

1154
00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:07.043
uh,

1155
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:08.183
culture.

1156
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:08.581
Uh,

1157
00:29:08.581 --> 00:29:09.121
that was,

1158
00:29:09.121 --> 00:29:11.010
that represented 100% of,

1159
00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:12.420
of the official culture.

1160
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:13.280
Uh,

1161
00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:13.560
uh,

1162
00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.480
in a real sense,

1163
00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:15.930
the culture of,

1164
00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:16.620
of,

1165
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:16.920
uh,

1166
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.140
pre Petrin that is pre Peter,

1167
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:19.440
uh,

1168
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:19.831
uh,

1169
00:29:19.831 --> 00:29:20.550
Russia,

1170
00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:20.940
uh,

1171
00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.400
because Russian culture was entirely religious.

1172
00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.510
If you went to Poland where I go off on,

1173
00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.510
as I've said before,

1174
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.990
uh,

1175
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.910
if you went to Krakow,

1176
00:29:28.911 --> 00:29:29.744
he Krokoff,

1177
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:30.540
uh,

1178
00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:30.691
uh,

1179
00:29:30.691 --> 00:29:31.240
were called porn.

1180
00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.240
Lucas worked and I've been in Copernicus,

1181
00:29:33.241 --> 00:29:33.750
uh,

1182
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:34.620
his work room.

1183
00:29:34.621 --> 00:29:36.170
It's just absolutely fantastic.

1184
00:29:36.171 --> 00:29:36.390
And,

1185
00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:39.030
and Cracow v you had a major university.

1186
00:29:39.031 --> 00:29:40.650
It was an important center of learning,

1187
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:44.770
a diffusion of scientific ideas and the scientific revolution,

1188
00:29:44.771 --> 00:29:46.850
and later of enlightenment ideals in,

1189
00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:47.770
in Ville News,

1190
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:48.940
which is the capital of,

1191
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:50.290
of Lithuania.

1192
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:51.070
Uh,

1193
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:52.540
you had a university as well,

1194
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.460
but there wasn't a university in Russia.

1195
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:55.090
Uh,

1196
00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:56.530
there was no equivalent of the,

1197
00:29:56.531 --> 00:29:58.980
of the Royal Society that you're reading about in,

1198
00:29:58.981 --> 00:29:59.830
in London.

1199
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:00.251
Uh,

1200
00:30:00.251 --> 00:30:01.680
that was very important in,

1201
00:30:01.681 --> 00:30:04.270
in the diffusion of the scientific revolution.

1202
00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.120
Or there's nothing like the Cat d media.

1203
00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:06.973
They see loss.

1204
00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:08.290
The Academy of Sciences,

1205
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:08.681
uh,

1206
00:30:08.681 --> 00:30:09.071
in,

1207
00:30:09.071 --> 00:30:09.490
um,

1208
00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:09.701
uh,

1209
00:30:09.701 --> 00:30:10.331
in Paris,

1210
00:30:10.331 --> 00:30:10.601
which was,

1211
00:30:10.601 --> 00:30:13.660
was founded in 1666.

1212
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:15.610
There's no legal tradition.

1213
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.350
And so there's no law school.

1214
00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.060
There is no medical school.

1215
00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:19.440
Uh,

1216
00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.160
there is no secular culture.

1217
00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:25.240
90% of all the books that were published before Peter,

1218
00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.570
we're a devotional text in the church.

1219
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:33.660
There was no word literally in Russian for the state or for the monarchy or for

1220
00:30:34.661 --> 00:30:35.440
the government.

1221
00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.210
They did not exist.

1222
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:38.110
The,

1223
00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:40.180
the state was an abstraction,

1224
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.980
but in the person of the czar,

1225
00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:42.940
it was,

1226
00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.200
was a reality.

1227
00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:44.561
Now,

1228
00:30:44.561 --> 00:30:44.951
the boy,

1229
00:30:44.951 --> 00:30:46.080
ours in the 16,

1230
00:30:46.081 --> 00:30:47.470
16th and 1670,

1231
00:30:47.471 --> 00:30:50.110
some of them began to learn Latin and Polish.

1232
00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:51.190
Uh,

1233
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:55.300
and diplomacy is still in Latin until the end of the 17th century.

1234
00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:56.350
And then as you know,

1235
00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.030
it becomes French.

1236
00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.170
Um,

1237
00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:00.350
but so what,

1238
00:31:00.351 --> 00:31:01.840
what about now?

1239
00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:05.080
What about his accomplishments besides the ones I've already mentioned,

1240
00:31:05.081 --> 00:31:06.670
to which I'll return a little bit?

1241
00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:07.510
Uh,

1242
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:12.400
Moscow via had already conquered the vulgar basin in the 16th century where

1243
00:31:12.401 --> 00:31:14.690
they're nomadic tattooers were a ta.

1244
00:31:14.691 --> 00:31:16.030
Te Ars.

1245
00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:20.260
This was important because it's the black earth region of rich agricultural

1246
00:31:20.261 --> 00:31:20.890
there.

1247
00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:24.190
And at what happens there is what happens in what happens in Russia is what

1248
00:31:24.191 --> 00:31:25.720
happens in impression as well.

1249
00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.670
And in other parts of eastern Europe,

1250
00:31:27.671 --> 00:31:29.170
particularly in the half for domains,

1251
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:30.930
is you have to make it very bad pun,

1252
00:31:30.931 --> 00:31:32.800
a resurfacing of,

1253
00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:33.311
uh,

1254
00:31:33.311 --> 00:31:37.420
of the region by people forced into surf contracts.

1255
00:31:37.421 --> 00:31:39.700
They become not contracts to become legally,

1256
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:40.630
uh,

1257
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:41.260
um,

1258
00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.970
legally part of the land,

1259
00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:43.923
literally.

1260
00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:44.231
Uh,

1261
00:31:44.231 --> 00:31:45.064
and so,

1262
00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:45.371
uh,

1263
00:31:45.371 --> 00:31:46.490
this follows the,

1264
00:31:46.491 --> 00:31:46.680
the,

1265
00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.051
the,

1266
00:31:47.051 --> 00:31:48.660
the ad to the arrival of,

1267
00:31:48.661 --> 00:31:48.841
of,

1268
00:31:48.841 --> 00:31:49.211
of,

1269
00:31:49.211 --> 00:31:49.660
uh,

1270
00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:49.901
uh,

1271
00:31:49.901 --> 00:31:53.410
the expansion of a serfdom expands along with,

1272
00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:53.711
uh,

1273
00:31:53.711 --> 00:31:55.270
the Russian Russian empire.

1274
00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:56.020
Um,

1275
00:31:56.020 --> 00:32:01.020
they already held Siberia and they reached the Pacific Ocean in the 1640s.

1276
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.720
Uh,

1277
00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:02.560
so this,

1278
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:06.100
I already said what the percent of what the number of miles square miles that

1279
00:32:06.101 --> 00:32:06.701
were increased,

1280
00:32:06.701 --> 00:32:11.200
but an increases from six to 16 million of the population.

1281
00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:13.180
They expand north to Archangel.

1282
00:32:13.181 --> 00:32:14.440
So this gives them a port,

1283
00:32:14.441 --> 00:32:15.430
but a frozen one.

1284
00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.780
And as I already said,

1285
00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:20.170
south and southeast to the expense of the Turks.

1286
00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:23.680
But Peter wanted a navy and you know,

1287
00:32:23.681 --> 00:32:26.290
if you're going to have a sort of circular reasoning,

1288
00:32:26.291 --> 00:32:27.520
if you want to have a navy,

1289
00:32:27.521 --> 00:32:28.450
you have to have a port.

1290
00:32:28.451 --> 00:32:29.530
And if you're going to have a port,

1291
00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.640
then you have to have a navy.

1292
00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:31.623
Why not?

1293
00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:32.051
Uh,

1294
00:32:32.051 --> 00:32:33.090
and so he,

1295
00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:38.460
he first built a navy on rivers using Dutch ship masters from,

1296
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:43.250
he once said that if he wasn't the tsar of all the Russians what he would want

1297
00:32:43.251 --> 00:32:43.521
to be,

1298
00:32:43.521 --> 00:32:45.770
it would be a rush of being an English admiral.

1299
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:48.710
He learned Dutch and Dutch is a very difficult language.

1300
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:49.220
Uh,

1301
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:50.420
in 1696,

1302
00:32:50.421 --> 00:32:51.710
while the Turkish war went on,

1303
00:32:51.711 --> 00:32:52.161
or one of them,

1304
00:32:52.161 --> 00:32:56.630
he went off to western Europe incognito as an embassy soldier.

1305
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:57.111
Again,

1306
00:32:57.111 --> 00:32:58.010
it was part of his,

1307
00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.500
his gamesmanship is pretend games.

1308
00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:04.250
And there he learned carpentry in a very serious way.

1309
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.270
He went to the light and men medical school because he wanted to see how you

1310
00:33:08.271 --> 00:33:08.590
did.

1311
00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:10.130
They dissected bodies.

1312
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:12.610
And so we went in there to,

1313
00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.070
uh,

1314
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:14.240
and then he went to London.

1315
00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:14.960
Uh,

1316
00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:15.920
and he,

1317
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:16.281
uh,

1318
00:33:16.281 --> 00:33:17.300
along the Thames,

1319
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:18.290
the major port,

1320
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:18.950
uh,

1321
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:21.710
obviously if the world event along with Amsterdam,

1322
00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:22.251
uh,

1323
00:33:22.251 --> 00:33:25.790
and he learned shipbuilding there as well.

1324
00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:26.391
Uh,

1325
00:33:26.391 --> 00:33:26.841
and,

1326
00:33:26.841 --> 00:33:26.930
uh,

1327
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.570
because the building of ships was to him,

1328
00:33:29.571 --> 00:33:31.790
the application of rationality,

1329
00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:34.640
of reason thinking and experimentation.

1330
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:37.940
This got him interested in the scientific revolution.

1331
00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:38.270
Uh,

1332
00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:42.080
there's nothing to a surprising about that is the essence of the scientific

1333
00:33:42.081 --> 00:33:42.914
revolution.

1334
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.140
He may have even attended a Quaker meeting,

1335
00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.570
but we're not sure about that.

1336
00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.320
But the problem was if you have a basically landlocked power and want to get to

1337
00:33:51.321 --> 00:33:51.980
the sea,

1338
00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:54.440
then you better have a navy.

1339
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.360
He'd learned to sail when he was young,

1340
00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:57.190
but on,

1341
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.340
uh,

1342
00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.173
on the river,

1343
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.910
uh,

1344
00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:00.080
and this also by the way,

1345
00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:04.760
gets him interested in baroque and these kinds of broke masquerades that he had

1346
00:34:04.761 --> 00:34:05.211
back in,

1347
00:34:05.211 --> 00:34:07.040
in Moscow and then in St Petersburg,

1348
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:07.790
uh,

1349
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:08.840
as well.

1350
00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.120
So,

1351
00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:10.650
um,

1352
00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:11.040
in,

1353
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.050
in all of this,

1354
00:34:12.051 --> 00:34:17.051
what he does is he makes to use an expression that I've already used before in

1355
00:34:17.151 --> 00:34:18.290
the context of absolutism.

1356
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:22.010
He makes the boy out while he's building his navy and expanding Russia.

1357
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:23.030
He makes the boy,

1358
00:34:23.031 --> 00:34:26.390
our junior partners in absolutism.

1359
00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.040
That phrase again.

1360
00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.880
Now they're only about 200 to 300.

1361
00:34:31.881 --> 00:34:32.121
Boy,

1362
00:34:32.121 --> 00:34:33.080
our families,

1363
00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:33.801
they owned,

1364
00:34:33.801 --> 00:34:34.191
by the way,

1365
00:34:34.191 --> 00:34:35.840
40,000 serfs,

1366
00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:41.000
own 40,000 serves just these 200 to 300 families.

1367
00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:46.300
And they build huge houses in the 17th century in Moscow with very old fashion.

1368
00:34:47.281 --> 00:34:48.860
Traditional Russian,

1369
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.440
uh,

1370
00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:49.940
uh,

1371
00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:50.930
architecture.

1372
00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:51.590
Um,

1373
00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:51.801
the,

1374
00:34:51.801 --> 00:34:52.031
the,

1375
00:34:52.031 --> 00:34:52.431
the empire,

1376
00:34:52.431 --> 00:34:56.150
the Russian empire was rather like Charlemagne's empire in 800 and the

1377
00:34:56.151 --> 00:34:57.620
coronation at ochin or x,

1378
00:34:57.621 --> 00:34:59.360
La Chapelle and all of that.

1379
00:34:59.361 --> 00:35:00.320
And that you have this,

1380
00:35:00.321 --> 00:35:00.540
it,

1381
00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.330
this Brock cracy that's a very,

1382
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:03.231
very,

1383
00:35:03.231 --> 00:35:03.650
uh,

1384
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:03.831
you know,

1385
00:35:03.831 --> 00:35:04.730
it's not really a bureaucracy,

1386
00:35:04.731 --> 00:35:07.520
but you've got these royal officials representing the royal will,

1387
00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:08.090
but,

1388
00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:13.090
but the actual impact in this vast expanse of the Russian empire isn't that

1389
00:35:13.191 --> 00:35:13.550
great.

1390
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:17.360
There's nobody telling people what to do on a day to day or even a month to

1391
00:35:17.361 --> 00:35:18.260
month basis.

1392
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:20.540
But yet there's an enhanced sense of,

1393
00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:21.530
of,

1394
00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:24.740
of obligation to the czar of all,

1395
00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:24.980
uh,

1396
00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:26.180
of the Russian people.

1397
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.820
There was an,

1398
00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:30.470
there's an advanced sense of state and of organization,

1399
00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.780
and that also is one of the things to put in,

1400
00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:33.681
in neons.

1401
00:35:33.681 --> 00:35:38.520
He creates committees of advisers that in ways are not that different than the

1402
00:35:38.521 --> 00:35:43.521
kinds of ministries that would evolve in Western absolute rulers,

1403
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:44.610
uh,

1404
00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:48.180
absolute state and states and in non absolute states,

1405
00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:48.601
uh,

1406
00:35:48.601 --> 00:35:49.434
as well.

1407
00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.780
And so by 1708 and 1709,

1408
00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:56.840
he has created a more European style administration for this fast empire.

1409
00:35:58.410 --> 00:35:59.490
Now the,

1410
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:03.210
he wants to build a capital city and that's where St Petersburg comes from.

1411
00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:04.603
Um,

1412
00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:05.453
uh,

1413
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.130
he,

1414
00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:10.830
it had been Swedish territory and his victories gives him a of this land.

1415
00:36:10.831 --> 00:36:10.921
I,

1416
00:36:10.921 --> 00:36:11.970
once I went to,

1417
00:36:11.971 --> 00:36:12.480
uh,

1418
00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.231
visit his,

1419
00:36:13.231 --> 00:36:13.890
uh,

1420
00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:14.131
you know,

1421
00:36:14.131 --> 00:36:15.390
the Summer Palace that he,

1422
00:36:15.391 --> 00:36:19.170
that he created and that Nicholas the second I love so much there.

1423
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.730
Um,

1424
00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:21.750
and so he constructs this new capital.

1425
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.750
Now what's important about the construction of St Petersburg?

1426
00:36:24.751 --> 00:36:26.220
I don't know how few people have ever been there.

1427
00:36:26.221 --> 00:36:27.090
I haven't been there for a very,

1428
00:36:27.091 --> 00:36:27.990
very long time,

1429
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:31.140
but that this city is not like Moscow at all.

1430
00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:32.280
When you look at Moscow,

1431
00:36:32.281 --> 00:36:33.810
you see these old traditional,

1432
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.240
the skyline is dominated by churches.

1433
00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:38.430
The influence of the Russian Orthodox Church,

1434
00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:39.211
Saint Peters,

1435
00:36:39.211 --> 00:36:40.560
who was completely different.

1436
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.180
It is a classical example.

1437
00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:43.740
Classic.

1438
00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.310
It's an example of classic great power,

1439
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.590
absolute urban planning.

1440
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.230
It has a long boulevard.

1441
00:36:52.231 --> 00:36:53.460
The Nevsky prospect,

1442
00:36:53.461 --> 00:36:54.091
very important.

1443
00:36:54.091 --> 00:36:55.290
In 1917,

1444
00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:56.340
uh,

1445
00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.650
the most dominant buildings are not churches.

1446
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.360
They are state buildings,

1447
00:37:00.361 --> 00:37:01.710
they are state structures.

1448
00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:03.450
So it's a different place.

1449
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.700
It reminds you of Madrid,

1450
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:07.770
it reminds you of Berlin,

1451
00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:12.920
it reminds you of Versailles and it reminds you of the Post [inaudible] Paris

1452
00:37:13.561 --> 00:37:16.470
that has post 1850s in 1860 Paris.

1453
00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:17.190
It is,

1454
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:20.070
it is the example of the street and imperialism,

1455
00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:24.020
what I call the imperialism of the straight line where you have large boulevards

1456
00:37:24.021 --> 00:37:28.620
and you can march armies down to reviewing stands and all of that totally

1457
00:37:28.621 --> 00:37:29.700
different than Moscow.

1458
00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:34.880
And the religious leaders did not like Peter because Peter is bringing in to a

1459
00:37:35.251 --> 00:37:37.770
Russian culture foreign elements.

1460
00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:38.460
Uh,

1461
00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:40.050
they're already suspicious of,

1462
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:41.670
of the implementation or the,

1463
00:37:41.671 --> 00:37:41.890
the,

1464
00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:42.630
the,

1465
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:45.870
the annexation of broke religious forms,

1466
00:37:45.871 --> 00:37:47.370
architectural forms,

1467
00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:47.740
uh,

1468
00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:52.560
and liturgical influences from Austria and from central Europe.

1469
00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:56.760
And now they got a guy who's telling the czar,

1470
00:37:56.761 --> 00:37:57.391
the boy,

1471
00:37:57.391 --> 00:38:01.560
ours women to dress like Western European women.

1472
00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:06.810
And he's telling the at at a time when beards meant a great deal religiously,

1473
00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.960
he's telling the men to shave off their beards.

1474
00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:15.140
He's telling them the men to a two wheeled forks and knives as well as weapons.

1475
00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:21.860
And to adopt Russian non Russian customs to bring them into Russia.

1476
00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.900
And so there's tremendous tension with,

1477
00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:25.621
with the church,

1478
00:38:25.621 --> 00:38:26.520
but he remains,

1479
00:38:26.521 --> 00:38:26.671
you know,

1480
00:38:26.671 --> 00:38:28.020
he is a true believer,

1481
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.430
but he is,

1482
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:34.510
he is bringing into Russian religious culture changes that were a deeply,

1483
00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:35.500
uh,

1484
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.100
uh,

1485
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.120
deeply resented.

1486
00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:37.690
Uh,

1487
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:41.050
some aristocrats began to put on Western style wigs,

1488
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:41.411
uh,

1489
00:38:41.411 --> 00:38:44.330
such as you could find at the court of Versailles.

1490
00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:47.440
Women had to wear high heels and sort of their sort of tottering long and

1491
00:38:47.441 --> 00:38:48.210
falling,

1492
00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:48.461
you know,

1493
00:38:48.461 --> 00:38:52.510
on the cobblestones wearing high heels I and European style,

1494
00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:52.841
uh,

1495
00:38:52.841 --> 00:38:53.680
addresses.

1496
00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.970
And he promulgated degrees as czar about daily life.

1497
00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:02.260
And this is a big a transformation as to his son.

1498
00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:06.430
His son was more under the influence of these traditional religious influences

1499
00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:07.301
and he,

1500
00:39:07.301 --> 00:39:07.600
uh,

1501
00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:12.600
is plotting against his own father when Peter on one of his trips has to return

1502
00:39:13.301 --> 00:39:14.200
back to,

1503
00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:15.153
to Russia.

1504
00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:15.850
Uh,

1505
00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:16.810
and in 17,

1506
00:39:16.811 --> 00:39:17.231
16,

1507
00:39:17.231 --> 00:39:18.064
17,

1508
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.000
a 17,

1509
00:39:19.001 --> 00:39:19.301
16,

1510
00:39:19.301 --> 00:39:19.631
17,

1511
00:39:19.631 --> 00:39:20.171
18,

1512
00:39:20.171 --> 00:39:24.400
Alexi had taken his mother's side in the divorce and did not like the Latvian

1513
00:39:24.401 --> 00:39:25.060
peasant.

1514
00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:25.510
Uh,

1515
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:26.530
a second wife.

1516
00:39:26.531 --> 00:39:28.630
He also didn't like military service.

1517
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:29.800
He was lazy.

1518
00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:30.820
And his father said,

1519
00:39:30.821 --> 00:39:33.550
I see you're spending more of your time in item list and in taking care of

1520
00:39:33.551 --> 00:39:35.380
business at this crucial time,

1521
00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:37.330
but Alexei doesn't get the,

1522
00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:38.620
doesn't get the point.

1523
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:39.760
And he begins to,

1524
00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:43.510
to plot in various ways with Desitin boy ours,

1525
00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:43.940
uh,

1526
00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:47.740
and he goes off and gets the support of the emperor of Austria to wage a war

1527
00:39:47.741 --> 00:39:48.940
against his own father.

1528
00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:50.170
Terrible idea.

1529
00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:51.400
And when he returns,

1530
00:39:51.401 --> 00:39:52.630
his father orders him,

1531
00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.840
he orders him tortured and under torture.

1532
00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:56.591
Alexi,

1533
00:39:56.591 --> 00:39:57.520
who probably dies of,

1534
00:39:57.521 --> 00:39:57.660
of,

1535
00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:58.160
of,

1536
00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.200
of cold,

1537
00:39:59.201 --> 00:40:00.034
not of torture,

1538
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:00.380
uh,

1539
00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.120
in a very,

1540
00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:01.211
uh,

1541
00:40:01.211 --> 00:40:01.900
frozen,

1542
00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:02.021
uh,

1543
00:40:02.021 --> 00:40:03.280
sell a name,

1544
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.480
Boyer accomplices.

1545
00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.160
And these people are toast.

1546
00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:06.461
Uh,

1547
00:40:06.461 --> 00:40:07.294
obviously,

1548
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:07.451
uh,

1549
00:40:07.451 --> 00:40:09.640
he probably the son died of probably TB,

1550
00:40:09.641 --> 00:40:13.030
but it related to all of this other business in is we can state,

1551
00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:14.163
um,

1552
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:16.300
and so that was the end of the sun.

1553
00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:17.290
But,

1554
00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:17.531
uh,

1555
00:40:17.531 --> 00:40:22.531
what lasted a longer than Alexi was the European Association of Russian culture.

1556
00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:23.860
Uh,

1557
00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:24.660
and,

1558
00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:25.240
uh,

1559
00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.770
Peter the great has,

1560
00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:27.280
uh,

1561
00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.560
has books translated from the West,

1562
00:40:29.561 --> 00:40:30.790
including John Locke,

1563
00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:31.241
uh,

1564
00:40:31.241 --> 00:40:32.074
into,

1565
00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:32.351
uh,

1566
00:40:32.351 --> 00:40:33.184
into Russian.

1567
00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.760
And this itself was a remarkable accomplishment because after all,

1568
00:40:36.761 --> 00:40:40.070
the Russian Orthodox Church man had been not interested in the renaissance and

1569
00:40:40.071 --> 00:40:43.720
all not interested in the scientific revolution and all.

1570
00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:44.800
And by 17,

1571
00:40:44.801 --> 00:40:45.340
10,

1572
00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:49.270
Russian students are being sent abroad to foreign universities,

1573
00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.260
particularly in Italy,

1574
00:40:50.261 --> 00:40:52.330
but also in France and in England.

1575
00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:52.930
Uh,

1576
00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:56.680
and they're studying practical things like marble work and metalwork and copper

1577
00:40:56.681 --> 00:40:57.190
work,

1578
00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:58.510
and not just ship building,

1579
00:40:58.511 --> 00:41:02.170
but they're also studying the life of the mind,

1580
00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:02.980
uh,

1581
00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:03.531
and,

1582
00:41:03.531 --> 00:41:04.060
uh,

1583
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:04.331
uh,

1584
00:41:04.331 --> 00:41:04.571
in,

1585
00:41:04.571 --> 00:41:04.901
in a way,

1586
00:41:04.901 --> 00:41:05.170
it's,

1587
00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:06.040
it's possible to argue,

1588
00:41:06.041 --> 00:41:07.650
which is what I'm arguing that,

1589
00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:08.710
and I'm not the first to do it,

1590
00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.870
but Peter the great was in many ways himself,

1591
00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:11.510
uh,

1592
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.860
uh,

1593
00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:16.860
a child of European rationalism of scientific,

1594
00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:18.130
uh,

1595
00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:19.900
culture of rationality.

1596
00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:20.670
And,

1597
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:21.220
uh,

1598
00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:21.641
have,

1599
00:41:21.641 --> 00:41:23.890
at least in the earlier stages of,

1600
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.770
uh,

1601
00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:25.690
of the enlightenment.

1602
00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:27.610
He was not against the church,

1603
00:41:27.611 --> 00:41:29.440
but he thought that people were wasting time,

1604
00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:29.810
uh,

1605
00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:30.641
being monks and,

1606
00:41:30.641 --> 00:41:30.841
and,

1607
00:41:30.841 --> 00:41:31.051
and,

1608
00:41:31.051 --> 00:41:32.410
and monks and other,

1609
00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:32.651
and,

1610
00:41:32.651 --> 00:41:34.400
and other people were all over the place.

1611
00:41:34.401 --> 00:41:36.410
And they're Russian Orthodox equivalent.

1612
00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.010
Uh,

1613
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:39.290
he wouldn't believe whatever wag once set of monks,

1614
00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:39.591
you know,

1615
00:41:39.591 --> 00:41:39.831
I,

1616
00:41:39.831 --> 00:41:40.310
uh,

1617
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:41.001
I sleep,

1618
00:41:41.001 --> 00:41:41.481
I eat.

1619
00:41:41.481 --> 00:41:42.314
I did just,

1620
00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:43.100
uh,

1621
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:43.731
and they prayed,

1622
00:41:43.731 --> 00:41:44.420
of course.

1623
00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:47.990
And to him this was not useless because it didn't serve the state.

1624
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:50.780
It didn't serve the denied the nastic interests of,

1625
00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:51.560
of,

1626
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.100
uh,

1627
00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:52.401
of the,

1628
00:41:52.401 --> 00:41:56.570
the dynasty which he identified with the Russian people.

1629
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:57.740
He did say ty,

1630
00:41:57.741 --> 00:41:59.390
he did not ever imagine,

1631
00:41:59.580 --> 00:41:59.720
uh,

1632
00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.460
the abandonment of the table of ranks,

1633
00:42:01.461 --> 00:42:03.740
which is set everybody in a hierarchy,

1634
00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:04.460
uh,

1635
00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:07.880
that not for a minute and we're talking about the end of the 17th and 18th

1636
00:42:07.881 --> 00:42:08.660
century.

1637
00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:10.490
But he believed that it was important to turn,

1638
00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:15.110
take the tools of science to take the tools of rational thought and apply them

1639
00:42:15.111 --> 00:42:16.310
to the good of the state.

1640
00:42:16.311 --> 00:42:19.020
Even if he saw that good of the state as an in,

1641
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.371
you know,

1642
00:42:19.371 --> 00:42:24.230
ships that could lob canon of balls even further against hostile ships and that

1643
00:42:24.231 --> 00:42:25.064
kind of thing.

1644
00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:25.490
Uh,

1645
00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:27.980
but he founds the first Russian museum,

1646
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:30.050
the first school of navigation.

1647
00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:30.560
Uh,

1648
00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.180
the first school of this and that,

1649
00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:32.850
uh,

1650
00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:33.011
uh,

1651
00:42:33.011 --> 00:42:33.130
there,

1652
00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:34.880
there are a hundred times more books,

1653
00:42:34.881 --> 00:42:35.421
pamphlets,

1654
00:42:35.421 --> 00:42:36.380
Prince and maps,

1655
00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:37.040
uh,

1656
00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.180
produced in Russia,

1657
00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:38.561
uh,

1658
00:42:38.561 --> 00:42:41.570
under the time of Peter the great than there had been in the whole previous,

1659
00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:42.000
uh,

1660
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:42.860
a century.

1661
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:44.023
Um,

1662
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:46.730
Peter as Lindsey Hughes has argued,

1663
00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:49.910
was highly suspicious of any alternative to state service,

1664
00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:50.900
uh,

1665
00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:51.950
especially the mastic,

1666
00:42:51.951 --> 00:42:52.820
a way of life,

1667
00:42:52.821 --> 00:42:54.170
which I've already said.

1668
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.830
Uh,

1669
00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:55.850
but he thought that it should be,

1670
00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:58.700
it should be channeled through state obligations,

1671
00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.830
be their taxes or labor duties.

1672
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:01.520
Uh,

1673
00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:02.390
at the same time,

1674
00:43:02.391 --> 00:43:04.610
he's equally suspicious of the godless.

1675
00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:07.100
So he was remain very Russian,

1676
00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:08.880
but it was importation of,

1677
00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:09.291
of,

1678
00:43:09.291 --> 00:43:11.510
of a more western ways of looking things,

1679
00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:12.140
uh,

1680
00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:12.973
that made,

1681
00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:13.310
uh,

1682
00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:14.150
that were very,

1683
00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:14.460
uh,

1684
00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:15.380
important.

1685
00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:18.800
He said he wrote once at the chief thing is to know your duties and our Edx by

1686
00:43:18.801 --> 00:43:20.990
heart and not put off things until tomorrow,

1687
00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:22.760
like his son did a four.

1688
00:43:22.761 --> 00:43:23.960
How can a state government,

1689
00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:24.700
uh,

1690
00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:25.250
uh,

1691
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:27.500
exist if edicts or not put into use,

1692
00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:28.310
uh,

1693
00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:29.180
et Cetera,

1694
00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:30.170
et cetera.

1695
00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:30.501
Uh,

1696
00:43:30.501 --> 00:43:31.334
their lives,

1697
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.820
uh,

1698
00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:32.660
should be,

1699
00:43:32.661 --> 00:43:33.494
be better.

1700
00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:34.190
Uh,

1701
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:35.840
that the concept of the state,

1702
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:36.410
uh,

1703
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:38.750
was fundamentally new to Russia,

1704
00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:42.590
but gradually came into existence and his accomplishments had,

1705
00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:42.921
uh,

1706
00:43:42.921 --> 00:43:43.640
a lot,

1707
00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:44.130
uh,

1708
00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:44.580
uh,

1709
00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:45.380
to do,

1710
00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:45.800
uh,

1711
00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.460
with that he wrote his son and 17 and forests that I may die tomorrow.

1712
00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:53.000
But be sure that you have little pleasure if you fail to follow my example,

1713
00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.090
you must love everything that contributes to the glory and honor of the

1714
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.983
Fatherland.

1715
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:59.270
You must love loyal advisors and servants,

1716
00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.850
whether they'd be foreigners or our own people,

1717
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.030
and spare no effort to serve the common good,

1718
00:44:05.031 --> 00:44:05.751
the common good.

1719
00:44:05.751 --> 00:44:07.850
It comes right out of enlightened thought.

1720
00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.690
That right comes out of lock and the,

1721
00:44:09.691 --> 00:44:10.130
and,

1722
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:11.270
and those folks.

1723
00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:12.350
If my advice is,

1724
00:44:12.351 --> 00:44:15.410
is lost in the wind and you do not do as I wish,

1725
00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:19.040
I do not recognize you as my son.

1726
00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:20.870
And that in the end,

1727
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:21.530
what,

1728
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:22.010
uh,

1729
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.361
what,

1730
00:44:22.361 --> 00:44:23.450
what came in the long run,

1731
00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.120
he remained a fanatically Russian patriot.

1732
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:27.620
The father of his people.

1733
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:28.190
Uh,

1734
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:31.010
his admiration for foreign things and approaches was tempered.

1735
00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:32.071
Its use,

1736
00:44:32.071 --> 00:44:34.290
argues his devotion to Russia,

1737
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:37.950
which he oversaw the common good.

1738
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.020
I became a real concept,

1739
00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:40.740
uh,

1740
00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:42.420
and one that unfortunately,

1741
00:44:42.421 --> 00:44:43.470
some of his successors,

1742
00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:43.770
uh,

1743
00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:44.200
didn't,

1744
00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:44.310
uh,

1745
00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:46.380
take a terribly seriously.

1746
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:47.251
But you know,

1747
00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:47.881
in conclusion,

1748
00:44:47.881 --> 00:44:52.290
he di he defiantly deliberately in effectively broke with tradition.

1749
00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:53.670
And in doing so,

1750
00:44:53.671 --> 00:44:58.671
he made himself sort of an outsider to traditional Russian ways of looking at

1751
00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:00.613
this thing.

1752
00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:03.660
And so this ambivalence that was part of his personal life,

1753
00:45:03.661 --> 00:45:08.190
the way he lived would be con constant theme in subsequent Russian history.

1754
00:45:08.191 --> 00:45:12.810
And still in many ways is today between Slava fields in western islanders.

1755
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:14.970
Those are the people that look inside the Russia,

1756
00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:15.710
uh,

1757
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:16.080
uh,

1758
00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:16.560
to,

1759
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:16.681
uh,

1760
00:45:16.681 --> 00:45:17.430
finding,

1761
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.700
uh,

1762
00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:19.560
what they think to be eternal truth.

1763
00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:24.600
And those people that want to Trump 10% look looks with a look to the west.

1764
00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:25.560
And that,

1765
00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:26.070
uh,

1766
00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:29.460
in Neon is what Peter the Great I did above all.

1767
00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:34.490
And for which he shall boast most be remembered next time to the enlightenment.

1768
00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:38.100
And some people whom you might not think of at first glance,

1769
00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:39.840
who teamed terribly enlightened.

1770
00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:41.040
See on Wednesday.
