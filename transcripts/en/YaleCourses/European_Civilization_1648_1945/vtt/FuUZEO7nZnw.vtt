1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.240
Today I want to talk about,

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:04.021
uh,

3
00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:05.090
about Stalin is,

4
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.210
and in doing so,

5
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:06.721
you know,

6
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:08.160
15 years ago,

7
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.330
uh,

8
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.260
lots of what we now know about the Soviet Union,

9
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.213
uh,

10
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.410
and it's through its entire history.

11
00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:16.521
We,

12
00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:17.100
we didn't,

13
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.430
we,

14
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.710
we didn't know because the archives weren't open.

15
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.210
And when the,

16
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.690
when the Soviet Union collapsed,

17
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.480
uh,

18
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.980
uh,

19
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.000
fell apart,

20
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.660
a disintegrated I in the early 1990s,

21
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.150
gradually lots of the archives are open.

22
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:33.691
And so,

23
00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:34.310
uh,

24
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.890
um,

25
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.030
what I have to say today,

26
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.350
I don't work in the Soviet Union,

27
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.840
but draws upon the work of Michael Holquist.

28
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.160
Uh,

29
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.010
I'm not Michael Holquist.

30
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.311
That's it.

31
00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:43.470
That's his dad of a guy.

32
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.470
What a tease.

33
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.790
I can't,

34
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.570
uh,

35
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.931
have,

36
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:46.350
uh,

37
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.530
Holquist anyone who used to teach at Cordell and now teaches it at,

38
00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:49.980
at,

39
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.430
uh,

40
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.263
Princeton,

41
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.961
uh,

42
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:52.950
and,

43
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.490
um,

44
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.790
you know,

45
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.081
and,

46
00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:59.081
and work also a more recent work on stolen ism of by Sheila Fitzpatrick.

47
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.051
So,

48
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:01.620
um,

49
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.090
let me just lay out the,

50
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:03.301
you know,

51
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:04.790
the overview at the,

52
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.150
at the beginning,

53
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:07.650
and I sit around this morning.

54
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.330
I didn't get home till real late last night,

55
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.231
so I sent her,

56
00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:12.540
I sent along about 1230 in the morning.

57
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.960
Uh,

58
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.860
various terms,

59
00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:14.910
what I forgot a couple,

60
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.740
a democratic centralism,

61
00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:16.951
right.

62
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:17.940
Opposition and blue.

63
00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:18.774
Caren.

64
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.411
Uh,

65
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:20.101
and what these,

66
00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:20.301
this,

67
00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:21.390
this stuff's all in the book,

68
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:25.470
so I hope you're able to get that and I'll do the same for next time.

69
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.723
Um,

70
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.500
so the,

71
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.491
you know,

72
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:30.740
the question remains is,

73
00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:30.991
is,

74
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:31.231
did,

75
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:31.530
did,

76
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.363
did,

77
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.850
did,

78
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.480
did Lennon,

79
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.640
did Lennon inevitably lead to Stalin and,

80
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.501
and that's,

81
00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:37.861
that's,

82
00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:38.480
uh,

83
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.631
you know,

84
00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:38.801
that,

85
00:01:38.801 --> 00:01:39.870
that's a hard one.

86
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.230
Uh,

87
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.360
I,

88
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.191
I guess,

89
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:41.800
uh,

90
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.510
um,

91
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.721
you know,

92
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:45.000
basically the structure of,

93
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.170
uh,

94
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.620
what became a morphed into the Soviet regime,

95
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.490
uh,

96
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.490
was set it the way that the Bolshevik party operated even before taking power

97
00:01:56.731 --> 00:01:59.010
and a fundamental concept was democratic.

98
00:01:59.011 --> 00:01:59.844
Centralism.

99
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.510
Uh,

100
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.343
and that is,

101
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.980
uh,

102
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.230
it's the way that the Soviet state became,

103
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:05.280
became organized.

104
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.540
It's a top down,

105
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:07.763
uh,

106
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.490
uh,

107
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.001
way of,

108
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:09.570
of,

109
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.380
uh,

110
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.213
of,

111
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.790
of,

112
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.090
of making decisions and,

113
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.411
and,

114
00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:16.230
and sending out a relevant communication.

115
00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:16.831
In principle.

116
00:02:16.831 --> 00:02:17.700
It was supposed to,

117
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.150
uh,

118
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.530
involve the debate,

119
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:20.520
uh,

120
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.941
uh,

121
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:22.470
at the highest levels.

122
00:02:22.471 --> 00:02:22.920
And then,

123
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.770
then once decisions were taken that then they were,

124
00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:26.220
uh,

125
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.090
communicated,

126
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.690
uh,

127
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.460
through,

128
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.710
uh,

129
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.880
the communist party.

130
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.010
But of course,

131
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.370
uh,

132
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.040
the cheer,

133
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.811
the paranoia of,

134
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:33.000
of,

135
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.271
of,

136
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:34.104
of Stalin,

137
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.161
and he wasn't,

138
00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:35.370
you know,

139
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.570
as a clinical paranoid,

140
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.380
uh,

141
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.360
and this paranoia,

142
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.810
uh,

143
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.040
led to the deaths of,

144
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:41.251
of,

145
00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:41.790
of,

146
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.590
of millions of people.

147
00:02:43.591 --> 00:02:47.600
But debate itself became as a concept under stalling ism,

148
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:48.560
ah,

149
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.840
uh,

150
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.060
identified with anti-soviet behavior.

151
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.260
And,

152
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.690
and so,

153
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.420
essentially what had been begun as,

154
00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:54.701
as,

155
00:02:54.701 --> 00:02:55.051
as a,

156
00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:57.960
as a popular revolution on behalf of the,

157
00:02:57.961 --> 00:02:58.081
uh,

158
00:02:58.081 --> 00:02:58.440
of,

159
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.430
of working people and also to an extent on behalf of nationalities,

160
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.970
uh,

161
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.860
became the dictatorship,

162
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.540
not of the proletariat,

163
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.400
not of the proletariat,

164
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.390
but of the Communist Party of the Bolshevik Party,

165
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.580
transformed into the communist party and the dictatorship of,

166
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:19.550
um,

167
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.670
uh,

168
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:20.503
of Stalin.

169
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.520
Uh,

170
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.331
and of course,

171
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:23.590
as his paranoia,

172
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:24.610
I increased,

173
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.990
uh,

174
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.860
the purchase,

175
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.390
the purchase followed,

176
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.470
uh,

177
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.831
uh,

178
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:31.240
the big show trials,

179
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.230
some of which were,

180
00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:32.650
uh,

181
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.370
people,

182
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.610
uh,

183
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.070
western Communist went and,

184
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.220
and sat and listened to it to hear people confessed to having been in,

185
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:40.054
in a,

186
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.200
a cahoots with,

187
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:41.531
with,

188
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:42.100
uh,

189
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.221
uh,

190
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:43.570
with Nazis or with,

191
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:44.140
with,

192
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.620
uh,

193
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.570
with the English royalists or whomever,

194
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:48.640
and confessed to things that they certainly never done,

195
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.510
uh,

196
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.920
not long before,

197
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.211
uh,

198
00:03:51.211 --> 00:03:51.461
their,

199
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:52.450
their execution.

200
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:53.111
Uh,

201
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:57.010
and so one of the points to be made today a is in a following,

202
00:03:57.011 --> 00:03:58.660
I'm following Holquist,

203
00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.590
um,

204
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.560
is that the,

205
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.110
the structure of,

206
00:04:03.111 --> 00:04:04.960
of the Stalinist terror,

207
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.333
um,

208
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.880
there were antecedents that one could see in,

209
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.721
uh,

210
00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:12.070
in the civil war,

211
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.640
uh,

212
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.470
and in the period of,

213
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:14.801
uh,

214
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:16.130
of Lennon's,

215
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.263
uh,

216
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.420
dot domination of,

217
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.220
in the early years of,

218
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:21.900
uh,

219
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.160
uh,

220
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.200
of the Soviet Union.

221
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.950
Uh,

222
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.810
but that very quickly,

223
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.100
very early on,

224
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:28.810
um,

225
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.940
that the people who imagine that nationalities,

226
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:35.051
uh,

227
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:35.884
would have,

228
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.930
uh,

229
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.700
would have autonomy.

230
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.073
Uh,

231
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.820
the,

232
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:42.150
the,

233
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.671
those,

234
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:44.050
those hopes were,

235
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:46.350
were destroyed quite quickly and installing,

236
00:04:46.351 --> 00:04:46.871
they had been,

237
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:47.140
you know,

238
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.060
a minister or whatever they called her comment,

239
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.501
call me,

240
00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:50.150
Sarah,

241
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.340
of,

242
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.640
of nationalities.

243
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:52.181
Uh,

244
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:53.530
and the idea that workers,

245
00:04:53.531 --> 00:04:54.700
self management,

246
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:55.570
self control,

247
00:04:55.571 --> 00:04:57.340
control the means of production,

248
00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.320
uh,

249
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.320
wha what would be implemented in this new brave world,

250
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.860
uh,

251
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.120
were shattered rather quickly,

252
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.841
uh,

253
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:05.440
with,

254
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.621
uh,

255
00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:06.670
with strikes and,

256
00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:07.380
and,

257
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.530
and protest by,

258
00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:09.460
by workers,

259
00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:10.030
uh,

260
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.460
uh,

261
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.910
a smashed by a,

262
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.720
uh,

263
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.910
by,

264
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:13.101
by,

265
00:05:13.101 --> 00:05:13.990
by the police,

266
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.590
uh,

267
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.821
by,

268
00:05:14.821 --> 00:05:15.970
by the Soviet state.

269
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.200
Um,

270
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.580
and of course the illusion would,

271
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.670
would be perpetuated in the,

272
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.881
you know,

273
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:22.691
in the 20s,

274
00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:22.851
and,

275
00:05:22.851 --> 00:05:24.010
and even in the 30s,

276
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:24.844
that this was a,

277
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.650
a true,

278
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.230
uh,

279
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.700
uh,

280
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.460
a worker's paradise and that everything was groovy,

281
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.353
groovy.

282
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.050
But the talk was always about the radiant future.

283
00:05:34.051 --> 00:05:36.280
And the radiant was a word that they used a lot,

284
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:37.450
that the future,

285
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.180
and I'll talk more about this in awhile,

286
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.940
uh,

287
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:40.850
would be radiant.

288
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.860
It would be glorious,

289
00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:43.960
but the sacrifices had to be made now,

290
00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:47.230
and they had to be made now to protect the revolution against the,

291
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.741
uh,

292
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:48.730
against the Americans,

293
00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:49.540
against the,

294
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.841
uh,

295
00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:52.930
the French and against the British and the powers of capitalism,

296
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.450
uh,

297
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.660
it,

298
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.191
et Cetera,

299
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:55.024
et cetera.

300
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.480
Um,

301
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.313
and of course,

302
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.263
as you all know,

303
00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.741
it,

304
00:05:57.741 --> 00:05:58.410
uh,

305
00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.121
it never,

306
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:00.200
it never came to be.

307
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.001
And that,

308
00:06:01.001 --> 00:06:02.600
that's the tragedy of,

309
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:03.434
uh,

310
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.921
uh,

311
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:04.754
of the,

312
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:05.081
uh,

313
00:06:05.081 --> 00:06:06.290
of the restroom revolution.

314
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.940
Um,

315
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:08.380
well,

316
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.440
any more about this?

317
00:06:09.441 --> 00:06:09.920
Uh,

318
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:10.730
um,

319
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:11.061
I,

320
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:11.360
uh,

321
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.890
yeah,

322
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.040
in a while.

323
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.270
Um,

324
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.350
but certainly first of all was backdrop I to all of this,

325
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.701
uh,

326
00:06:18.701 --> 00:06:18.970
one,

327
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:19.640
um,

328
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.320
because of the civil war and because of the of famine conditions and because of

329
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:25.610
just enormous economic,

330
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:26.250
uh,

331
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.350
a hardship,

332
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.160
uh,

333
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.371
the,

334
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:28.790
the,

335
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:29.540
uh,

336
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.111
trying to,

337
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:30.944
to,

338
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.470
trying to have a state what was,

339
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:34.071
was not,

340
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:34.520
uh,

341
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.120
uh,

342
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.361
uh,

343
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:36.440
it was not clear how this,

344
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.860
who could,

345
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:37.850
could this possibly,

346
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.170
uh,

347
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.020
a be done.

348
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.560
Uh,

349
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.781
and,

350
00:06:39.781 --> 00:06:42.080
and you've got a country with all these nationalities and,

351
00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:43.600
and which is basically a,

352
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.971
still,

353
00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:48.971
essentially a country of peasants despite the industrial work in the Ural

354
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.981
Mountains.

355
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:49.261
And,

356
00:06:49.261 --> 00:06:49.520
and,

357
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.120
uh,

358
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.511
uh,

359
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:51.620
in the mines and in,

360
00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:51.851
in,

361
00:06:51.851 --> 00:06:52.161
in,

362
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:52.760
um,

363
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.593
uh,

364
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.290
in what town it became Petrograd became Leonard Grad,

365
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:57.770
uh,

366
00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:58.250
uh,

367
00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:58.730
uh,

368
00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:59.750
obviously later.

369
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.000
Uh,

370
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.700
so you're going to how to,

371
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:01.940
how to do this and,

372
00:07:01.941 --> 00:07:02.271
and,

373
00:07:02.271 --> 00:07:02.750
uh,

374
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:02.841
uh,

375
00:07:02.841 --> 00:07:04.070
the war itself,

376
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:04.461
uh,

377
00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:07.350
as in all of the countries that participated in world one had to,

378
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.230
had just had done an enormous ravages.

379
00:07:09.231 --> 00:07:09.441
I mean,

380
00:07:09.441 --> 00:07:10.370
the Germans are fighting,

381
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:10.720
uh,

382
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.553
inside,

383
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.140
uh,

384
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.930
inside Russia and the subsequent civil war,

385
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.730
uh,

386
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:16.251
of that,

387
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:16.341
uh,

388
00:07:16.341 --> 00:07:16.551
you know,

389
00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:18.440
decimated large parts of,

390
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:18.681
of,

391
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:19.011
of,

392
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:19.251
of,

393
00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:21.680
of the countryside a left the country,

394
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:21.990
uh,

395
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.990
barely able to function between 1921 and 1922 or in 1921 and 1922,

396
00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:30.290
this is in what you're reading.

397
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:31.250
Um,

398
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:36.250
more than 7 million people died of starvation a and sickness,

399
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:37.551
uh,

400
00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:39.380
during that period.

401
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.060
And remember the wars go on.

402
00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:44.960
The war against Poland goes on until finally the situation is resolved with the

403
00:07:44.961 --> 00:07:45.740
Treaty of,

404
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.240
of Riga in 1921,

405
00:07:47.241 --> 00:07:49.400
which I don't think it's a is in,

406
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.390
in your book.

407
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:51.410
Um,

408
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:51.770
but,

409
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.770
but Lenin implemented the new economic policy and,

410
00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:58.460
um,

411
00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.151
as,

412
00:07:59.151 --> 00:08:00.770
as he and the other,

413
00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:01.340
uh,

414
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:01.941
uh,

415
00:08:01.941 --> 00:08:03.080
Soviet leaders,

416
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:04.010
uh,

417
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:05.270
grappled with,

418
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:05.630
uh,

419
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.030
with a country and virtual a collapse.

420
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.080
Um,

421
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.820
he recognized,

422
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:11.121
uh,

423
00:08:11.121 --> 00:08:11.954
that,

424
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:12.830
uh,

425
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.620
that the ideology of communism,

426
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:15.800
uh,

427
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.300
which,

428
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:16.490
uh,

429
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:20.840
called for the abolition of private a property private ownership,

430
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:21.680
uh,

431
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.030
and the destruction of the free market would have to be sacrificed,

432
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:26.630
uh,

433
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:27.320
for,

434
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:27.440
uh,

435
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.870
the future because you simply had to be able to,

436
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:30.380
uh,

437
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.280
to feed people.

438
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.400
You had to have peasants not hoarding what they produced,

439
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.210
uh,

440
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.770
or waiting for higher prices.

441
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.101
I,

442
00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:39.260
you needed to have a free market system,

443
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:39.800
uh,

444
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.410
at least for Hawaiian [inaudible],

445
00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:42.180
uh,

446
00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:42.951
because of,

447
00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:43.371
of,

448
00:08:43.371 --> 00:08:43.910
um,

449
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:44.540
uh,

450
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:44.840
uh,

451
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.321
the fact that,

452
00:08:45.321 --> 00:08:45.501
that,

453
00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:45.890
that people,

454
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:50.450
people resisted what n w which was what was called war communism.

455
00:08:50.451 --> 00:08:50.600
Uh,

456
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.351
which was,

457
00:08:51.351 --> 00:08:51.790
uh,

458
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:52.130
uh,

459
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.441
sort of,

460
00:08:52.441 --> 00:08:52.670
uh,

461
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:57.670
a shock communists therapy that I had proved not to really work at all.

462
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.600
And so the new economic policy is,

463
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.200
uh,

464
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.220
is promulgated in,

465
00:09:02.221 --> 00:09:04.140
in March of 19,

466
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:04.621
uh,

467
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:07.050
21 in and the features you can,

468
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.070
you can read about,

469
00:09:08.071 --> 00:09:08.904
but basically,

470
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.330
uh,

471
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:10.620
the state remains.

472
00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:10.811
It's,

473
00:09:10.811 --> 00:09:15.811
it maintains it's centralized control over the economy under still centralized

474
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:17.124
planning,

475
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:17.700
but that,

476
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.550
but the NDP allowed peasants to,

477
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.210
uh,

478
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.520
to use their land as if it was their own.

479
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:23.681
And,

480
00:09:23.681 --> 00:09:23.950
and,

481
00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:24.231
and,

482
00:09:24.231 --> 00:09:25.064
and largely,

483
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:25.471
uh,

484
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:26.530
in most cases,

485
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:27.390
it's still,

486
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.020
uh,

487
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:33.020
was and allowed a markets to a lot of them to market their products and sell

488
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:36.180
them at a market,

489
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.900
a market prices in order to get food on,

490
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.190
uh,

491
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:41.040
uh,

492
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.120
food to people who,

493
00:09:42.121 --> 00:09:42.440
uh,

494
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:42.740
who,

495
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:43.573
who needed it.

496
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.831
Uh,

497
00:09:43.831 --> 00:09:45.310
otherwise they too would,

498
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.163
would've died.

499
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:47.130
Um,

500
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:51.510
and the state can maintain its control over over heavy industry,

501
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.870
but this is all going to be just a small,

502
00:09:54.871 --> 00:09:55.440
uh,

503
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:55.840
uh,

504
00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.021
uh,

505
00:09:56.021 --> 00:09:57.630
a retreat along,

506
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:58.161
uh,

507
00:09:58.161 --> 00:10:00.960
the road to socialism.

508
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:02.250
Now it's succeeded,

509
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:03.930
it succeeded,

510
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.280
it works.

511
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:06.180
Um,

512
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.560
and gradually,

513
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.483
uh,

514
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:09.410
the production of,

515
00:10:09.411 --> 00:10:09.591
of,

516
00:10:09.591 --> 00:10:10.410
of food,

517
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:10.970
uh,

518
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:11.160
uh,

519
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.250
reach a prewar a levels and,

520
00:10:14.251 --> 00:10:16.320
and small scale industrial production,

521
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:16.950
uh,

522
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:17.101
uh,

523
00:10:17.101 --> 00:10:18.960
revives now,

524
00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:19.860
oh,

525
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:20.201
another,

526
00:10:20.201 --> 00:10:21.600
a name I should have written on the board.

527
00:10:21.601 --> 00:10:23.010
Of course I was so tired.

528
00:10:23.011 --> 00:10:23.844
Uh,

529
00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:24.920
and I,

530
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.690
and I did all this last night is of course coolmax.

531
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.710
Um,

532
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:33.710
and so two groups of people who profited during this period,

533
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.580
two groups of people,

534
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:36.690
uh,

535
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:37.530
would,

536
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:38.423
um,

537
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.640
in the long memory of the communist leadership,

538
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:42.773
uh,

539
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:43.380
uh,

540
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.250
get theirs,

541
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:44.791
uh,

542
00:10:44.791 --> 00:10:45.490
during,

543
00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:45.690
uh,

544
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:47.430
the five year plan.

545
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.200
The first are those people who,

546
00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:49.921
for example,

547
00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:50.251
were,

548
00:10:50.251 --> 00:10:51.810
were small merchants,

549
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:52.740
uh,

550
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:53.191
uh,

551
00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:54.010
or not in,

552
00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:55.200
in size,

553
00:10:55.201 --> 00:10:55.381
but,

554
00:10:55.381 --> 00:10:55.771
but the,

555
00:10:55.771 --> 00:10:56.110
you know,

556
00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:56.350
they,

557
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.751
they,

558
00:10:56.751 --> 00:10:57.121
they,

559
00:10:57.121 --> 00:10:57.450
uh,

560
00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:58.710
sold products on a,

561
00:10:58.711 --> 00:11:02.160
I'm the free market and did very well during this period of,

562
00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:02.500
of,

563
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.130
uh,

564
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.040
of the new economic policy.

565
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:06.960
And they became known as neck men.

566
00:11:06.961 --> 00:11:09.060
Nap is the new economic policy.

567
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.860
And the net men were people who did well during this period and the other,

568
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:16.440
and it's a term as we'll see in a while that became a,

569
00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:16.621
you know,

570
00:11:16.621 --> 00:11:19.020
a term of denigration and indeed would,

571
00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.270
could lead you straight to the gulag.

572
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.380
Uh,

573
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.280
if you were lucky.

574
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:24.300
Uh,

575
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.770
and we're an executed before that.

576
00:11:25.771 --> 00:11:29.070
And these were cooler box and cooler box.

577
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:29.881
Basically,

578
00:11:29.881 --> 00:11:31.260
we're prosperous peasants.

579
00:11:31.261 --> 00:11:33.060
They were well off peasants.

580
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.910
And during the period of the new economic policy,

581
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:40.650
the cool box people with land who had something to sell and it did well indeed,

582
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:41.280
uh,

583
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.150
because they're,

584
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:43.050
uh,

585
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.130
they're goods,

586
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.170
a fetch fetch,

587
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.070
good prices,

588
00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:48.060
and they did very well.

589
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.080
Uh,

590
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.460
but with,

591
00:11:50.461 --> 00:11:50.791
uh,

592
00:11:50.791 --> 00:11:51.270
you know,

593
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.520
with the gradual ending of new economic policy,

594
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.170
which will trickles to an end,

595
00:11:56.171 --> 00:11:56.570
uh,

596
00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:56.770
uh,

597
00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:56.951
you know,

598
00:11:56.951 --> 00:11:57.521
after,

599
00:11:57.521 --> 00:11:58.510
after Lennon,

600
00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:59.350
uh,

601
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.690
that they would become targets,

602
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:02.470
uh,

603
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.721
uh,

604
00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:05.710
in the mass collectivization campaign,

605
00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:06.581
uh,

606
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:11.530
that accompanied the five year plan that is 1928 to 1933.

607
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:12.580
Um,

608
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.240
and,

609
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:13.900
uh,

610
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.141
uh,

611
00:12:14.141 --> 00:12:16.000
would be themselves victims,

612
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:16.471
uh,

613
00:12:16.471 --> 00:12:18.010
of the purges,

614
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:18.461
uh,

615
00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:19.900
as we'll see.

616
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:20.291
And of course,

617
00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:20.390
well,

618
00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:22.150
one of the great tragedies,

619
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:22.410
a,

620
00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:22.690
I mean,

621
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:23.491
the tragedy of,

622
00:12:23.491 --> 00:12:23.670
of,

623
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:24.850
of the Russian revolution.

624
00:12:24.851 --> 00:12:25.031
I mean,

625
00:12:25.031 --> 00:12:25.870
there's a quote in there,

626
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:26.290
uh,

627
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:26.681
from,

628
00:12:26.681 --> 00:12:27.330
uh,

629
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:27.950
uh,

630
00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:28.151
from,

631
00:12:28.151 --> 00:12:30.250
I guess if somebody in the Red Army who says that we've,

632
00:12:30.251 --> 00:12:31.270
did we do all this?

633
00:12:31.271 --> 00:12:32.860
Did we fight in the civil war?

634
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.640
Did we try to save the revolution against some really basically horrible,

635
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:37.090
uh,

636
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:37.960
legions and,

637
00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:39.610
and the white armies,

638
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:40.210
uh,

639
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:41.130
during the civil war,

640
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:46.230
we save the revolution in order to round up cool locks and put them in,

641
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.340
in the middle of a field,

642
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:48.911
uh,

643
00:12:48.911 --> 00:12:49.840
in line them up,

644
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:50.260
uh,

645
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:54.220
in the middle of a field and gunned them down with machine guns to kill them.

646
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:56.320
Did we do all of this to,

647
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:57.010
uh,

648
00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.840
to eliminate from the face of the earth?

649
00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.700
These people who had,

650
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:01.260
uh,

651
00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:01.600
you know,

652
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:01.850
a bit,

653
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:03.610
despite being relatively privileged,

654
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:04.300
uh,

655
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:04.810
had,

656
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.420
had struggled and had managed to survive the whole thing.

657
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:08.321
And,

658
00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:08.501
you know,

659
00:13:08.501 --> 00:13:08.951
sadly,

660
00:13:08.951 --> 00:13:09.940
the answer is yes.

661
00:13:09.941 --> 00:13:10.181
I mean,

662
00:13:10.181 --> 00:13:10.371
it,

663
00:13:10.371 --> 00:13:10.531
it,

664
00:13:10.531 --> 00:13:10.740
it,

665
00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:11.800
it came to that.

666
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:11.930
And,

667
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:12.880
and the,

668
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:13.630
uh,

669
00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:14.260
uh,

670
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:14.571
and the,

671
00:13:14.571 --> 00:13:15.191
the question is,

672
00:13:15.191 --> 00:13:19.210
to what extent was this automatically built with this part of the system from

673
00:13:19.211 --> 00:13:20.044
the beginning?

674
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:23.770
And I'll give you some examples that Holquist sites in a minute.

675
00:13:23.771 --> 00:13:24.581
And he says,

676
00:13:24.581 --> 00:13:26.080
you can see this coming.

677
00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.850
If you look at the first,

678
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:28.580
uh,

679
00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:28.960
Eh,

680
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.580
the first years of,

681
00:13:30.581 --> 00:13:31.414
um,

682
00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:32.080
uh,

683
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:32.750
of the,

684
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.960
of,

685
00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.870
of the Soviet people.

686
00:13:34.871 --> 00:13:35.704
Let me give you some,

687
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:36.670
uh,

688
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:36.911
uh,

689
00:13:36.911 --> 00:13:39.580
some examples of this.

690
00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:40.923
Um,

691
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:41.560
and this,

692
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.250
this is,

693
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:42.480
you know,

694
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.350
before,

695
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:43.900
uh,

696
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.930
the period where we're Stalin,

697
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.710
Stalin,

698
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.370
Stalin becomes a successor.

699
00:13:51.371 --> 00:13:51.521
I mean,

700
00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:52.354
Stalin,

701
00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.260
Stalin worked very hard to make it seem,

702
00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.250
uh,

703
00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:57.551
as,

704
00:13:57.551 --> 00:13:58.780
as Lennon with was,

705
00:13:58.810 --> 00:13:59.261
uh,

706
00:13:59.261 --> 00:13:59.620
was,

707
00:13:59.620 --> 00:13:59.950
was,

708
00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:00.431
he'd had,

709
00:14:00.431 --> 00:14:00.850
he had,

710
00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:01.210
uh,

711
00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:02.680
one stroke and then another,

712
00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.080
and Stalin tried to keep access,

713
00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:05.740
uh,

714
00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:06.211
uh,

715
00:14:06.211 --> 00:14:07.110
a closed,

716
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:07.430
uh,

717
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:08.410
to other people.

718
00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:08.990
And,

719
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.370
uh,

720
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:09.660
he,

721
00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.280
he worked feverish to make it seem that,

722
00:14:12.281 --> 00:14:14.500
that Stalin was the chosen successor of,

723
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:14.970
uh,

724
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:15.803
of Lennon.

725
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.580
And there some famous doctrine photographs where we're,

726
00:14:18.581 --> 00:14:19.090
uh,

727
00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:19.480
uh,

728
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.081
stolen,

729
00:14:20.081 --> 00:14:20.460
has a,

730
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.570
has had himself inserted,

731
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.440
uh,

732
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.980
next to Lenin in fee and famous opposes of Lennon.

733
00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:27.341
Uh,

734
00:14:27.341 --> 00:14:27.611
who was,

735
00:14:27.611 --> 00:14:27.690
uh,

736
00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.010
who was a pretty good speaker and nothing like Trotsky.

737
00:14:30.011 --> 00:14:30.790
Trotsky was young.

738
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:31.231
[inaudible] has,

739
00:14:31.231 --> 00:14:32.940
was the greatest order of,

740
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:34.270
of the entire period.

741
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:34.990
Uh,

742
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:35.201
but,

743
00:14:35.201 --> 00:14:36.700
but Lennon wasn't too bad.

744
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.270
Uh,

745
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:37.571
and,

746
00:14:37.571 --> 00:14:40.670
and them literally himself stuck into o two,

747
00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.670
two pictures where he would be there.

748
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:43.420
Uh,

749
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.990
and he also took some of Lennon's writings and sort of,

750
00:14:46.991 --> 00:14:47.510
uh,

751
00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:47.920
uh,

752
00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:48.580
you know,

753
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.050
quote unquote updated them with,

754
00:14:50.051 --> 00:14:50.290
with,

755
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:50.990
with his,

756
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.560
uh,

757
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:51.921
uh,

758
00:14:51.921 --> 00:14:52.910
to me it seem light,

759
00:14:52.911 --> 00:14:53.121
light,

760
00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:53.331
light.

761
00:14:53.331 --> 00:14:53.860
Like he,

762
00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:54.910
he the mantle,

763
00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.230
I was there and everybody is,

764
00:14:57.231 --> 00:14:57.801
everybody knows,

765
00:14:57.801 --> 00:14:58.011
I mean,

766
00:14:58.011 --> 00:14:59.060
who falls his stuff at all,

767
00:14:59.240 --> 00:14:59.850
uh,

768
00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:00.380
that,

769
00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:00.690
that,

770
00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:01.521
that Lennon was,

771
00:15:01.521 --> 00:15:01.851
was,

772
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:03.380
was in his final days,

773
00:15:03.381 --> 00:15:05.810
most concerned that the Comrade Stalin,

774
00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:06.560
uh,

775
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.191
with that,

776
00:15:07.191 --> 00:15:10.670
his leadership Wa was potentially very dangerous.

777
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:11.390
Uh,

778
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:11.871
I,

779
00:15:11.871 --> 00:15:12.231
and,

780
00:15:12.231 --> 00:15:12.681
and he,

781
00:15:12.681 --> 00:15:12.861
you know,

782
00:15:12.861 --> 00:15:13.190
he,

783
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:15.740
he expressed that those fears in a,

784
00:15:15.741 --> 00:15:16.041
you know,

785
00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:16.451
in,

786
00:15:16.451 --> 00:15:16.550
in,

787
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:17.300
in the letter,

788
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.051
if I remember correctly,

789
00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:18.230
you know,

790
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.590
written with a very shaky hand of a man who had,

791
00:15:20.591 --> 00:15:21.500
who had had a stroke,

792
00:15:21.501 --> 00:15:21.651
a,

793
00:15:21.651 --> 00:15:22.160
uh,

794
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:22.640
uh,

795
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.810
a very serious stroke,

796
00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.180
and then who was close to death,

797
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:27.110
uh,

798
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.470
that,

799
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:28.191
that he,

800
00:15:28.191 --> 00:15:28.600
uh,

801
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:28.910
uh,

802
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:29.930
he had his doubts about,

803
00:15:29.931 --> 00:15:31.130
about Comrade Stalin.

804
00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:31.820
Uh,

805
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.500
not exactly from it from the beginning.

806
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:36.250
And also it's important to note that the Trotsky,

807
00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:36.980
uh,

808
00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:37.191
who,

809
00:15:37.191 --> 00:15:37.620
who am I,

810
00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:38.570
as I said the other day,

811
00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:38.781
would,

812
00:15:38.781 --> 00:15:40.330
would finally be tracked down and,

813
00:15:40.331 --> 00:15:40.661
and,

814
00:15:40.661 --> 00:15:40.811
uh,

815
00:15:40.811 --> 00:15:44.090
assassinated in a garden in Mexico City.

816
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:44.940
Uh,

817
00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:45.290
or that,

818
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.870
that the differences between Trotsky and Stalin,

819
00:15:47.871 --> 00:15:48.630
of course,

820
00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:49.370
uh,

821
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:51.530
they went beyond etiology.

822
00:15:51.531 --> 00:15:55.460
Trotsky was w in what became known as the left opposition,

823
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:56.121
uh,

824
00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:57.260
there was pushing for,

825
00:15:57.261 --> 00:15:57.951
for more,

826
00:15:57.951 --> 00:15:58.161
you know,

827
00:15:58.161 --> 00:15:59.610
active instigation of,

828
00:15:59.611 --> 00:16:01.760
of revolutions in other places.

829
00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:01.961
And,

830
00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:04.820
and ironically was pushing even more for,

831
00:16:04.821 --> 00:16:05.300
uh,

832
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:05.610
you know,

833
00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:06.950
for collectivization,

834
00:16:06.951 --> 00:16:07.310
uh,

835
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:07.610
uh,

836
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:09.230
even early on,

837
00:16:09.231 --> 00:16:09.770
but it went,

838
00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:10.740
it wasn't more than,

839
00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:11.420
uh,

840
00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:11.901
than that.

841
00:16:11.901 --> 00:16:12.111
I mean,

842
00:16:12.111 --> 00:16:12.471
there was a,

843
00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:16.640
there was a rivalry between two men who both were extraordinarily sure of

844
00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:17.450
themselves,

845
00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:17.870
uh,

846
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.670
and who thought that they were,

847
00:16:19.671 --> 00:16:20.504
um,

848
00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:21.000
uh,

849
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.910
that they were the person who should lead a first save and then lead the,

850
00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:26.780
uh,

851
00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:27.291
uh,

852
00:16:27.291 --> 00:16:27.551
the,

853
00:16:27.551 --> 00:16:28.371
the Soviet Union.

854
00:16:28.371 --> 00:16:28.731
And of course,

855
00:16:28.731 --> 00:16:29.860
Trotsky's role in,

856
00:16:29.861 --> 00:16:30.041
in,

857
00:16:30.041 --> 00:16:30.501
in,

858
00:16:30.501 --> 00:16:31.160
in,

859
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:31.310
uh,

860
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:32.300
the Red Army,

861
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:32.871
uh,

862
00:16:32.871 --> 00:16:34.100
as a strategist with was,

863
00:16:34.101 --> 00:16:35.360
it was extremely important,

864
00:16:35.361 --> 00:16:36.680
but there was more than that also,

865
00:16:36.681 --> 00:16:37.190
uh,

866
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:37.341
uh,

867
00:16:37.341 --> 00:16:37.740
there was,

868
00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:38.210
uh,

869
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:39.740
more than a small trace of,

870
00:16:39.741 --> 00:16:40.071
of,

871
00:16:40.071 --> 00:16:40.580
uh,

872
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.140
of antisemitism,

873
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:42.730
uh,

874
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:43.070
in,

875
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:46.580
in installing [inaudible] and when he would refer to refer to,

876
00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:46.941
you know,

877
00:16:46.941 --> 00:16:49.160
cosmopolitan to enemies and things like that.

878
00:16:49.161 --> 00:16:51.410
And cosmopolitanism was sort of a code word for,

879
00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:51.861
for,

880
00:16:51.861 --> 00:16:52.700
for Jews,

881
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:53.420
uh,

882
00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:53.601
uh,

883
00:16:53.601 --> 00:16:53.811
for,

884
00:16:53.811 --> 00:16:54.620
for Jewish,

885
00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.130
uh,

886
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:55.610
uh,

887
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:55.790
uh,

888
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.230
people within the party.

889
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:58.063
And they're more than that.

890
00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.210
There was more than that for that,

891
00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.960
but a trust gave courses is a,

892
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:02.960
um,

893
00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.790
is expelled from the party.

894
00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:04.990
And,

895
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:06.290
and finally as tracked down,

896
00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:07.040
uh,

897
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.030
and killed.

898
00:17:08.031 --> 00:17:08.300
And,

899
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:08.550
and,

900
00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:09.261
and some of these,

901
00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:10.970
as you know from reading Orwell,

902
00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:11.361
uh,

903
00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:12.230
some of these,

904
00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:12.441
you know,

905
00:17:12.441 --> 00:17:16.520
these factions in these differences play themselves out and this anticipation

906
00:17:16.521 --> 00:17:17.151
and World War II,

907
00:17:17.151 --> 00:17:19.990
that was the Spanish civil war and the Troskey serve very,

908
00:17:19.991 --> 00:17:21.100
very important faction in,

909
00:17:21.101 --> 00:17:21.320
in the,

910
00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.070
in the,

911
00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:22.670
uh,

912
00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:23.031
uh,

913
00:17:23.031 --> 00:17:23.510
in,

914
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:24.830
in the Spanish civil war.

915
00:17:24.831 --> 00:17:25.281
And of course,

916
00:17:25.281 --> 00:17:26.450
as you know from reading Orwell,

917
00:17:26.451 --> 00:17:27.170
the role of the,

918
00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:27.950
of the solidness,

919
00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:28.580
uh,

920
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.840
in all of this.

921
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:30.500
Um,

922
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.250
anyway,

923
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:32.083
um,

924
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:33.920
just a few things before I,

925
00:17:33.921 --> 00:17:34.460
I,

926
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:34.850
um,

927
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:36.770
turned to Holquist argument about how some of this,

928
00:17:36.771 --> 00:17:40.550
you can see some of the horrors coming early on.

929
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:41.990
Let me just define a,

930
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.030
um,

931
00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:43.360
uh,

932
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.450
a style aneurysm,

933
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:45.360
you know,

934
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.210
as a,

935
00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:47.090
as a term.

936
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:48.020
And here I'm drawing on,

937
00:17:48.021 --> 00:17:48.230
on,

938
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.630
on,

939
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:49.060
um,

940
00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:49.330
on,

941
00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.610
on Holquist ah,

942
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:52.230
that is a set of tenets,

943
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.310
policies and practices that characterize the Soviet government.

944
00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:56.670
You know,

945
00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.540
during the period when Stalin is in power and it's taller than this,

946
00:17:59.541 --> 00:18:00.810
some last and still stolen,

947
00:18:00.811 --> 00:18:01.830
finally dies.

948
00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:02.140
One is,

949
00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:02.280
uh,

950
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:02.910
uh,

951
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:03.300
uh,

952
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.133
19,

953
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:04.740
uh,

954
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:05.431
53.

955
00:18:05.431 --> 00:18:05.581
Yeah,

956
00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:06.121
that is when,

957
00:18:06.121 --> 00:18:07.170
when Stalin dies.

958
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:07.830
Um,

959
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:08.740
and the beginning of the,

960
00:18:08.741 --> 00:18:13.741
the five year plan a that is 1928 to 1933,

961
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:14.461
uh,

962
00:18:14.461 --> 00:18:15.270
is really,

963
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.570
uh,

964
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:16.650
the real beginning of a,

965
00:18:16.651 --> 00:18:17.580
of a stall.

966
00:18:17.581 --> 00:18:17.850
I'm this,

967
00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:21.330
I'm that you can anticipate some of this as we'll see in a minute.

968
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:22.140
Um,

969
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.010
and I'm installing with them is,

970
00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:24.340
uh,

971
00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:28.350
does not only takes a sort of democratic centralism of decision making,

972
00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:32.370
but what it does is it employs a state coercion.

973
00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:35.040
And we're more than this state terror,

974
00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:35.520
uh,

975
00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:40.520
with the goal of transforming this still relatively backward a society into Ah,

976
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:48.030
a Soviet state that could sustain itself,

977
00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.460
that could be old heavy industries.

978
00:18:50.461 --> 00:18:55.461
And this was the obsession of stolen and stolen is that heavy industries would

979
00:18:56.911 --> 00:19:01.911
have to be built and that they would be built on the backs of the peasantry who

980
00:19:02.881 --> 00:19:06.240
would lose their land and become industrial workers.

981
00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.550
There's a massive urbanization as we'll see,

982
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:09.390
uh,

983
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:10.530
in the Soviet Union,

984
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:11.130
uh,

985
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:12.750
during this period.

986
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:17.490
And the obvious central characteristics of Stalin is as you've already seen,

987
00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:19.200
or the abolition of private property,

988
00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:21.450
first of all,

989
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:22.643
and the end of,

990
00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:23.410
of free trade,

991
00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:24.270
the end of the market,

992
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.750
the market is to disappear.

993
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:32.520
And if you're abolishing private property in a vast,

994
00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.670
vast state in which you know,

995
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.050
two generations before,

996
00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:38.400
you still had serfs,

997
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:43.140
what you want to do from their point of view with collectivize agriculture.

998
00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:44.510
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

999
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:47.270
<v 0>The collect the massive collectivization of agriculture.</v>

1000
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.800
And this would as you know,

1001
00:19:48.801 --> 00:19:50.270
become a characteristic of,

1002
00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.490
of the satellite states,

1003
00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:53.480
ah,

1004
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:58.480
in eastern Europe and the eastern central Europe with varying degrees and

1005
00:19:58.510 --> 00:19:59.343
varying degrees,

1006
00:19:59.490 --> 00:19:59.870
uh,

1007
00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:00.480
in,

1008
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:00.710
uh,

1009
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:01.610
those states.

1010
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:03.440
But the economy is planned.

1011
00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:09.820
It's run in a centralized fashion and predicated upon mass industries,

1012
00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.150
rapid industrialization.

1013
00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.560
And part of this with the liquidation,

1014
00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:24.100
not a nice word of those exploiting classes.

1015
00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:26.470
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1016
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:27.790
<v 0>That is the bourgeois.</v>

1017
00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:29.820
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1018
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:30.750
<v 0>The NAP men,</v>

1019
00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:32.770
the Kulaks,

1020
00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.240
the aristocrats and the clergy.

1021
00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:40.960
And so this involves,

1022
00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:42.093
uh,

1023
00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:47.100
the porting people to the gulags or them wherever they were,

1024
00:20:48.371 --> 00:20:52.540
incarcerating them in the Google lines and the purge,

1025
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:53.231
the tear,

1026
00:20:53.231 --> 00:20:57.580
the political tear against no alleged enemies,

1027
00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.340
including those who disagreed with Stalin within,

1028
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:01.150
uh,

1029
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:02.260
within the leadership of the,

1030
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:03.400
of the Soviet Union.

1031
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:08.670
Thus the purchase that you can read about of the left opposition of a is Enovia

1032
00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.050
Evan Trotsky and Bucara wins,

1033
00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:12.910
right?

1034
00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:13.743
Opposition.

1035
00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:19.390
And with this comes the cult of personality.

1036
00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:21.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1037
00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.920
<v 0>That Stalin himself becomes,</v>

1038
00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:26.240
uh,

1039
00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.031
and I say this,

1040
00:21:27.031 --> 00:21:27.250
you know,

1041
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:28.110
in quotes,

1042
00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.120
a czar like figure

1043
00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.180
<v 1>yeah.</v>

1044
00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:32.300
<v 0>Are,</v>

1045
00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.740
there are still truck drivers in,

1046
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.670
in Russia who have pictures of Stalin and know in their trucks and other other

1047
00:21:38.671 --> 00:21:39.690
people as well.

1048
00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:40.501
And of course,

1049
00:21:40.501 --> 00:21:45.060
this leads to obviously to kind of move a half bake a political sign.

1050
00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:46.140
Yes.

1051
00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.280
Interpretations that,

1052
00:21:47.281 --> 00:21:47.840
well,

1053
00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.290
you ha you have a Zuora state,

1054
00:21:49.291 --> 00:21:51.630
you have an autocracy and inevitably becomes another,

1055
00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:52.170
uh,

1056
00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.690
autocracy with a czar like figure,

1057
00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:55.230
uh,

1058
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:57.480
the cult of personality of stolen.

1059
00:21:57.481 --> 00:21:58.000
But you think of,

1060
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.480
of Mao's China and they're,

1061
00:21:59.481 --> 00:21:59.730
you know,

1062
00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:00.840
the cult of personality.

1063
00:22:00.841 --> 00:22:01.650
If anything,

1064
00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:01.861
you know,

1065
00:22:01.861 --> 00:22:02.311
what was,

1066
00:22:02.311 --> 00:22:04.580
what was even more than that with the Little Red Book and,

1067
00:22:04.581 --> 00:22:05.130
and,

1068
00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:06.330
and all of this business.

1069
00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:07.260
Uh,

1070
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:08.093
but,

1071
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:08.390
uh,

1072
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:10.020
the drew repeat the obvious that,

1073
00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:10.310
that,

1074
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:15.270
that the Soviet Union was the dictatorship of the communist party

1075
00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:21.970
and the dictatorship of the communist party with a dictatorship of Joseph

1076
00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:22.760
Stalin.

1077
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:23.593
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1078
00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.750
<v 0>And the paranoia of Joseph Stalin now,</v>

1079
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:28.740
ironically,

1080
00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:29.970
uh,

1081
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:30.511
stolen is,

1082
00:22:30.511 --> 00:22:30.811
I'm sure,

1083
00:22:30.811 --> 00:22:31.171
you know,

1084
00:22:31.171 --> 00:22:32.190
was not rush them.

1085
00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:33.930
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1086
00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:37.410
<v 0>Even though the empire was largely run the Soviet Empire,</v>

1087
00:22:37.411 --> 00:22:37.831
and it was,

1088
00:22:37.831 --> 00:22:41.850
that was largely run in the interests of Russia and Russians.

1089
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.080
Stalin was a George,

1090
00:22:44.081 --> 00:22:45.780
and he was from,

1091
00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:46.291
you know,

1092
00:22:46.291 --> 00:22:47.400
from the country,

1093
00:22:47.401 --> 00:22:47.910
uh,

1094
00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:48.570
uh,

1095
00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:48.991
uh,

1096
00:22:48.991 --> 00:22:50.090
in which all of,

1097
00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:50.370
you know,

1098
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:50.731
these,

1099
00:22:50.731 --> 00:22:51.840
these things have happened.

1100
00:22:51.841 --> 00:22:51.961
And,

1101
00:22:51.961 --> 00:22:53.010
and just the last,

1102
00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:53.341
you know,

1103
00:22:53.341 --> 00:22:54.121
five or six months,

1104
00:22:54.121 --> 00:22:56.160
he started out as a seminary student.

1105
00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.010
He was expelled for Reading Marxists tracks.

1106
00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:00.420
Uh,

1107
00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.500
like a lot of these people,

1108
00:23:01.501 --> 00:23:03.030
he took aliases because he,

1109
00:23:03.031 --> 00:23:03.121
oh,

1110
00:23:03.121 --> 00:23:05.070
he robbed banks to money for the,

1111
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:05.641
uh,

1112
00:23:05.641 --> 00:23:06.090
for,

1113
00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:06.370
uh,

1114
00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:07.800
the Bolshevik party.

1115
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:08.980
Uh,

1116
00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.730
the Stalin a means in Russian man of steel.

1117
00:23:11.731 --> 00:23:12.600
That was his alias.

1118
00:23:12.601 --> 00:23:13.434
That wasn't his,

1119
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.580
his original name.

1120
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:15.743
Uh,

1121
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:16.270
and,

1122
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:16.801
and he was,

1123
00:23:16.801 --> 00:23:17.251
he was,

1124
00:23:17.251 --> 00:23:18.620
became the a,

1125
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:19.670
and he's a Georgian,

1126
00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.110
remember I just said he becomes the administer or the comedy cellar of

1127
00:23:22.111 --> 00:23:22.861
nationalities,

1128
00:23:22.861 --> 00:23:24.010
but determined to,

1129
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:24.720
to,

1130
00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.850
to snap the head off of,

1131
00:23:26.851 --> 00:23:27.540
of the hydro,

1132
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:27.840
of,

1133
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:28.081
of the,

1134
00:23:28.081 --> 00:23:28.590
of the,

1135
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:28.860
of,

1136
00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.920
of the danger of,

1137
00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.660
of nationalists a revival in,

1138
00:23:33.661 --> 00:23:38.340
in the states because p is communism in theory was antithetical to,

1139
00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.060
uh,

1140
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:39.893
to nationalism.

1141
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.441
Though,

1142
00:23:40.441 --> 00:23:41.011
ironically,

1143
00:23:41.011 --> 00:23:41.611
as you all know,

1144
00:23:41.611 --> 00:23:41.821
I mean,

1145
00:23:41.821 --> 00:23:42.470
they did that,

1146
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:43.560
it doesn't really work that way.

1147
00:23:43.561 --> 00:23:43.981
And there were,

1148
00:23:43.981 --> 00:23:44.200
you know,

1149
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.140
there were strongly nationalists Communist,

1150
00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:46.770
uh,

1151
00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:46.971
uh,

1152
00:23:46.971 --> 00:23:50.300
states that still retained a hungry,

1153
00:23:50.301 --> 00:23:51.120
for example,

1154
00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:51.710
uh,

1155
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:52.860
uh,

1156
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:53.290
or,

1157
00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:55.670
or check Tekla Slovakia for example.

1158
00:23:55.671 --> 00:23:58.820
There were that retained even within the satellite nature,

1159
00:23:58.821 --> 00:23:59.340
uh,

1160
00:23:59.340 --> 00:23:59.660
uh,

1161
00:23:59.660 --> 00:23:59.941
kind of,

1162
00:23:59.941 --> 00:24:00.280
uh,

1163
00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:00.710
uh,

1164
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:01.391
pride in,

1165
00:24:01.391 --> 00:24:01.521
in,

1166
00:24:01.521 --> 00:24:01.831
in,

1167
00:24:01.831 --> 00:24:02.091
in,

1168
00:24:02.091 --> 00:24:02.361
in,

1169
00:24:02.361 --> 00:24:03.320
in trying to make it work.

1170
00:24:03.321 --> 00:24:04.580
Even in 1968,

1171
00:24:04.581 --> 00:24:08.630
his Dube checked in 1968 before the tanks roll into prog,

1172
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:09.770
tries to making the,

1173
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:10.350
uh,

1174
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:10.850
uh,

1175
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:12.110
tries to make a acumen,

1176
00:24:12.111 --> 00:24:12.930
faced,

1177
00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:13.340
uh,

1178
00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:13.521
uh,

1179
00:24:13.521 --> 00:24:14.570
socialism with,

1180
00:24:14.571 --> 00:24:14.751
with,

1181
00:24:14.751 --> 00:24:17.270
with a Chieko checkins and Slovak face.

1182
00:24:17.271 --> 00:24:17.751
But of course,

1183
00:24:17.751 --> 00:24:17.851
it,

1184
00:24:17.851 --> 00:24:18.011
it,

1185
00:24:18.011 --> 00:24:18.191
it,

1186
00:24:18.191 --> 00:24:19.024
it doesn't,

1187
00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.090
it doesn't,

1188
00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:20.660
um,

1189
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.490
it doesn't work now.

1190
00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:23.750
I mean,

1191
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:24.471
through the whole period,

1192
00:24:24.471 --> 00:24:25.340
as everybody knows,

1193
00:24:25.341 --> 00:24:25.461
I mean,

1194
00:24:25.461 --> 00:24:26.294
they execute,

1195
00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:27.030
uh,

1196
00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:27.240
uh,

1197
00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.220
millions of people.

1198
00:24:28.221 --> 00:24:28.610
I mean,

1199
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:29.480
in World War Two,

1200
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.291
uh,

1201
00:24:30.291 --> 00:24:31.420
the figures of the number of,

1202
00:24:31.421 --> 00:24:33.040
of Soviets who died in World War II,

1203
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.940
who was about 25 million,

1204
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:36.530
25 million people.

1205
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:37.820
Now,

1206
00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.110
if you're thinking about styling Grad,

1207
00:24:39.111 --> 00:24:41.330
and you're thinking about the siege of Leningrad,

1208
00:24:41.331 --> 00:24:41.511
which,

1209
00:24:41.511 --> 00:24:41.811
which,

1210
00:24:41.811 --> 00:24:42.021
you know,

1211
00:24:42.021 --> 00:24:43.970
goes on and on and on and takes a,

1212
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:44.421
you know,

1213
00:24:44.421 --> 00:24:45.530
a million lives,

1214
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:46.280
uh,

1215
00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.200
but within that 25 million,

1216
00:24:48.201 --> 00:24:49.760
lots of those people were people who died,

1217
00:24:49.761 --> 00:24:51.080
who died in the gulags.

1218
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:52.340
Uh,

1219
00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:52.671
uh,

1220
00:24:52.671 --> 00:24:54.440
they did not die from reasons the war,

1221
00:24:54.441 --> 00:24:54.920
they died.

1222
00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.800
They died in the goop gulags and many of them were executed for,

1223
00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:01.920
for being a Kulak or being a Netmon or w w you know,

1224
00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:02.993
or whatever.

1225
00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:03.560
Now,

1226
00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.940
can you see this coming?

1227
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:05.780
Can you,

1228
00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.930
can one see this coming just a couple of points along the way?

1229
00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:09.950
Um,

1230
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:14.570
that during World War One states had increased their power,

1231
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:20.150
their ability to control what became sort of command economies.

1232
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:20.691
Uh,

1233
00:25:20.691 --> 00:25:23.540
to mobilize the resources of the state.

1234
00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:24.141
Uh,

1235
00:25:24.141 --> 00:25:24.891
in Russia,

1236
00:25:24.891 --> 00:25:26.000
in World War One,

1237
00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:27.320
the imperial government,

1238
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:27.950
uh,

1239
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:28.610
Holquist,

1240
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:28.911
uh,

1241
00:25:28.911 --> 00:25:30.300
rights initiated a,

1242
00:25:30.301 --> 00:25:33.680
a deportation of quote unquote the Jewish element.

1243
00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:34.721
Now remember the,

1244
00:25:34.721 --> 00:25:34.900
the,

1245
00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:35.111
the,

1246
00:25:35.111 --> 00:25:37.150
the rabidly antisemitism of,

1247
00:25:37.151 --> 00:25:37.351
of,

1248
00:25:37.351 --> 00:25:42.140
of the czar and Alexandra on the border lines as quote,

1249
00:25:42.141 --> 00:25:43.610
pernicious quote,

1250
00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.670
harmful and dangerous to the Russian people.

1251
00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:47.810
Um,

1252
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:48.643
and thus,

1253
00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:49.550
uh,

1254
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:51.110
that's in war time.

1255
00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:52.010
They are,

1256
00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:53.043
uh,

1257
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:55.760
they just as an Ra in Italy,

1258
00:25:55.761 --> 00:25:59.840
Italy went to war in part so that they had the idea that they could somehow make

1259
00:25:59.841 --> 00:26:01.850
citizens Italian field themselves.

1260
00:26:01.851 --> 00:26:02.660
Italian.

1261
00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:05.750
There is this nature is the worst being flood in Russia,

1262
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:06.111
uh,

1263
00:26:06.111 --> 00:26:06.860
that you,

1264
00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:07.310
uh,

1265
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:08.990
that you will increase the Russian,

1266
00:26:08.991 --> 00:26:11.660
this of the effort of the empire,

1267
00:26:11.661 --> 00:26:15.620
even though all these other nationalities are involved by excluding people,

1268
00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.360
by excluding people.

1269
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.640
Now they're not excluding people,

1270
00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:20.300
uh,

1271
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:20.840
by,

1272
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:21.200
you know,

1273
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.100
putting them up the wall.

1274
00:26:22.101 --> 00:26:23.000
I'm shooting them.

1275
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:23.780
Uh,

1276
00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:24.561
but they,

1277
00:26:24.561 --> 00:26:24.891
uh,

1278
00:26:24.891 --> 00:26:26.240
there nonetheless,

1279
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.111
there,

1280
00:26:27.111 --> 00:26:27.944
um,

1281
00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:28.620
uh,

1282
00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:29.180
the,

1283
00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.950
the language is somewhat there.

1284
00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:31.101
Uh,

1285
00:26:31.101 --> 00:26:31.641
for example,

1286
00:26:31.641 --> 00:26:32.000
the,

1287
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.670
they described the whites who are a nasty group,

1288
00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:35.753
uh,

1289
00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.150
many of them and just nasty bloodthirsty group.

1290
00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:38.983
Not all of them,

1291
00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:39.863
but many of them,

1292
00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:40.310
uh,

1293
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:41.240
they described,

1294
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:42.223
um,

1295
00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:43.570
eh,

1296
00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:44.150
the,

1297
00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:45.090
the Jews as,

1298
00:26:45.091 --> 00:26:45.530
as,

1299
00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:46.070
uh,

1300
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.500
uh,

1301
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.730
as microbes.

1302
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:51.210
This is the whites describing the Jews as microbes.

1303
00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:52.160
Uh,

1304
00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:52.830
uh,

1305
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:53.140
and,

1306
00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.590
and Bolshevism is a social disease.

1307
00:26:55.591 --> 00:26:55.771
I mean,

1308
00:26:55.771 --> 00:26:57.630
the kind of disease metaphors,

1309
00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:58.410
uh,

1310
00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:00.380
are the next step is if you have it,

1311
00:27:00.381 --> 00:27:00.571
you know,

1312
00:27:00.571 --> 00:27:01.111
a disease.

1313
00:27:01.111 --> 00:27:01.950
If you have a cancer,

1314
00:27:01.951 --> 00:27:02.910
you cut it out,

1315
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:05.310
you exclude it by cutting it out.

1316
00:27:05.311 --> 00:27:07.650
And so the language of exclusion,

1317
00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:08.550
uh,

1318
00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:09.110
is,

1319
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:10.470
is already there.

1320
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:11.640
Um,

1321
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.480
and at one point,

1322
00:27:12.481 --> 00:27:14.720
the Soviets in the very first part of the,

1323
00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:15.171
of the,

1324
00:27:15.171 --> 00:27:17.190
of the Soviet Union began a problem with program,

1325
00:27:17.191 --> 00:27:19.890
what they call d causes constant causation.

1326
00:27:19.891 --> 00:27:23.100
They want to remove an entire caustic population,

1327
00:27:23.101 --> 00:27:23.934
which they viewed as,

1328
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.460
as potentially disloyal to the revolution.

1329
00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:27.061
But you can't,

1330
00:27:27.061 --> 00:27:27.990
you can't do that.

1331
00:27:27.991 --> 00:27:28.530
And you know what I mean?

1332
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:31.490
It's just too hard to do that when all these other things are going on until

1333
00:27:31.491 --> 00:27:32.324
they don't really,

1334
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:33.210
um,

1335
00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:33.451
uh,

1336
00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:33.661
they,

1337
00:27:33.661 --> 00:27:33.821
they,

1338
00:27:33.821 --> 00:27:34.151
they,

1339
00:27:34.151 --> 00:27:34.431
they,

1340
00:27:34.431 --> 00:27:35.430
they can't do that.

1341
00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:36.840
But in the early years,

1342
00:27:36.841 --> 00:27:37.740
the Lennon years,

1343
00:27:37.741 --> 00:27:38.281
they're still,

1344
00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:40.530
you find these things in 1921,

1345
00:27:40.531 --> 00:27:44.370
there's a campaign against bandit TISM that is bandits are people who,

1346
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.080
who don't support the,

1347
00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:46.620
uh,

1348
00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:47.341
the communists.

1349
00:27:47.341 --> 00:27:49.130
That term is often used by the way in,

1350
00:27:49.131 --> 00:27:49.411
in,

1351
00:27:49.411 --> 00:27:49.741
in,

1352
00:27:49.741 --> 00:27:50.250
uh,

1353
00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:50.581
uh,

1354
00:27:50.581 --> 00:27:50.761
you know,

1355
00:27:50.761 --> 00:27:52.680
in France under Vishi that their terror,

1356
00:27:52.681 --> 00:27:53.161
that people,

1357
00:27:53.161 --> 00:27:55.380
the resistors are bandits are there or they're terrorists,

1358
00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:55.971
et Cetera,

1359
00:27:55.971 --> 00:27:56.610
et cetera.

1360
00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:59.340
And band has become a dangerous epidemic.

1361
00:27:59.520 --> 00:27:59.881
Again,

1362
00:27:59.881 --> 00:28:01.530
the disease metaphor,

1363
00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:03.510
they're dangerous because,

1364
00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.790
because they are in 1920,

1365
00:28:05.791 --> 00:28:07.830
Stalin informed Trotsky,

1366
00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:09.330
a Holquist found,

1367
00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:09.900
uh,

1368
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:14.900
that an order would soon come directing quote to total extermination of the

1369
00:28:15.241 --> 00:28:16.740
white officer course,

1370
00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:18.330
a core,

1371
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:18.990
uh,

1372
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:19.411
of course,

1373
00:28:19.411 --> 00:28:20.500
total extermination.

1374
00:28:20.501 --> 00:28:21.660
That's pretty strong language.

1375
00:28:21.661 --> 00:28:23.300
That's not just simply putting people in,

1376
00:28:23.301 --> 00:28:24.100
in the,

1377
00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:24.600
you know,

1378
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.950
in jail or in a camp,

1379
00:28:25.951 --> 00:28:27.720
in a reeducation camp that is,

1380
00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:28.260
you know,

1381
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.093
getting rid of them.

1382
00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:30.360
They create camps,

1383
00:28:30.361 --> 00:28:35.250
which were called filter spaces where people could be kept until they had seen

1384
00:28:35.251 --> 00:28:35.890
the light,

1385
00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:36.420
uh,

1386
00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:36.991
et Cetera,

1387
00:28:36.991 --> 00:28:37.824
et cetera.

1388
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:38.783
Um,

1389
00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:39.623
and,

1390
00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:40.501
uh,

1391
00:28:40.501 --> 00:28:40.801
they,

1392
00:28:40.801 --> 00:28:42.870
they have all these white guard prison.

1393
00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:43.120
Uh,

1394
00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.170
what these white prisoners that,

1395
00:28:45.171 --> 00:28:45.381
that,

1396
00:28:45.381 --> 00:28:47.790
that some of whom of course executed.

1397
00:28:47.791 --> 00:28:50.520
And the checker or the police who oversee all of this.

1398
00:28:50.521 --> 00:28:50.731
I mean,

1399
00:28:50.731 --> 00:28:52.350
that's an obvious term.

1400
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:52.820
Uh,

1401
00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.500
so examples from the,

1402
00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:59.540
from the civil war as Holquist and hocus words Holquist words show the project

1403
00:28:59.581 --> 00:29:04.230
of fashioning society by excising particular elements was an intrinsic,

1404
00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:07.830
intrinsic aspect of Soviet power from the very beginning.

1405
00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:10.890
But it's not on the scale that would come later.

1406
00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:11.670
Um,

1407
00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:14.070
there are lists of people drawn up in,

1408
00:29:14.071 --> 00:29:14.870
in the,

1409
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:15.270
uh,

1410
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:20.270
early 1920s that would be used in 1937 and 1938 during,

1411
00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:21.570
uh,

1412
00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:21.780
uh,

1413
00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:22.440
the great,

1414
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.060
um,

1415
00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:23.440
uh,

1416
00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.930
I the great purge.

1417
00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:25.501
Uh,

1418
00:29:25.501 --> 00:29:26.460
and so when,

1419
00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:26.881
you know,

1420
00:29:26.881 --> 00:29:28.890
when the campaigns of collectivization,

1421
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.330
which are bloody,

1422
00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:32.880
which are massacres come along,

1423
00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:33.840
um,

1424
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:34.201
you know,

1425
00:29:34.201 --> 00:29:37.890
the Deq Kulik cool accusation campaign,

1426
00:29:37.891 --> 00:29:40.350
get rid of the cool ox 1929,

1427
00:29:40.351 --> 00:29:41.440
1930,

1428
00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:42.010
uh,

1429
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:42.843
it becomes,

1430
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:43.181
uh,

1431
00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:47.320
on a more urgent and more paranoid scale a memorandum.

1432
00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.270
This is the kind of stuff that we now know from the archives,

1433
00:29:49.271 --> 00:29:52.180
a memorandum from March 15th,

1434
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.370
1931 states that with regard to the cooler box,

1435
00:29:54.371 --> 00:29:57.700
the goal of deportation from all regions was quote too,

1436
00:29:57.701 --> 00:30:00.430
totally cleanse them of cool ox and,

1437
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:04.030
and another a slightly earlier in February called for them to be quote

1438
00:30:04.031 --> 00:30:05.440
immediately liquidated.

1439
00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:06.580
Uh,

1440
00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.700
we will exile the Kulak by thousands and when necessary,

1441
00:30:09.701 --> 00:30:11.320
shoot the Kulak breed.

1442
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:13.870
We will make soap of the cooler box.

1443
00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:17.410
Our class enemy must be wiped off from the face of the earth.

1444
00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.970
Strong language.

1445
00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.060
And thus in 1930 more than yeah,

1446
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:22.080
20,000 cool.

1447
00:30:22.081 --> 00:30:24.190
Ox were sentenced to death.

1448
00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:24.641
And of course,

1449
00:30:24.641 --> 00:30:28.510
many more are gunned down when they protest and they protest,

1450
00:30:28.511 --> 00:30:28.621
they,

1451
00:30:28.621 --> 00:30:28.850
they,

1452
00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:31.240
they killed her animals rather than turn them off,

1453
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:31.630
uh,

1454
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:32.350
over,

1455
00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:32.800
uh,

1456
00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:33.370
to,

1457
00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:33.990
uh,

1458
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.900
did the call me Sal,

1459
00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:35.770
they,

1460
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:36.160
uh,

1461
00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.590
they burn their harvest,

1462
00:30:38.591 --> 00:30:40.030
they burn their farms.

1463
00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:40.490
Uh,

1464
00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:40.960
they are,

1465
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.290
these are weapons and the weapons of the weak is my dear friend Jim Scott.

1466
00:30:44.291 --> 00:30:46.180
What w and political science department,

1467
00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:46.511
uh,

1468
00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:46.781
would,

1469
00:30:46.781 --> 00:30:47.471
would call it,

1470
00:30:47.471 --> 00:30:48.190
and we can,

1471
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:48.460
the,

1472
00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.001
they were,

1473
00:30:49.001 --> 00:30:50.710
because they're confronting these enormous,

1474
00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:51.550
uh,

1475
00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:51.941
uh,

1476
00:30:51.941 --> 00:30:53.560
these enormous military forces,

1477
00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:54.460
but they fight back,

1478
00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:54.671
you know,

1479
00:30:54.671 --> 00:30:56.170
they fight back and they,

1480
00:30:56.171 --> 00:30:56.381
you know,

1481
00:30:56.381 --> 00:30:57.101
they don't just,

1482
00:30:57.101 --> 00:30:57.670
uh,

1483
00:30:57.670 --> 00:30:59.310
they just don't go down in,

1484
00:30:59.320 --> 00:30:59.951
in a,

1485
00:30:59.951 --> 00:31:00.341
you know,

1486
00:31:00.341 --> 00:31:00.581
and,

1487
00:31:00.581 --> 00:31:00.820
uh,

1488
00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:01.653
uh,

1489
00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:01.990
uh,

1490
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.291
you know,

1491
00:31:02.291 --> 00:31:02.710
in,

1492
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.861
in,

1493
00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:03.980
in a heat with,

1494
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.241
with,

1495
00:31:04.241 --> 00:31:04.541
with,

1496
00:31:04.541 --> 00:31:05.374
without fighting.

1497
00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:05.981
Now,

1498
00:31:05.981 --> 00:31:06.910
one of the interesting things,

1499
00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:09.670
interesting things about this is just after,

1500
00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:09.851
you know,

1501
00:31:09.851 --> 00:31:10.684
one of the,

1502
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:15.700
one of the key trends in the end of the 19th century is of course the origins of

1503
00:31:15.701 --> 00:31:16.534
sociology.

1504
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:17.663
Uh,

1505
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:18.760
intellectual trends.

1506
00:31:18.761 --> 00:31:19.540
The idea of,

1507
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:23.050
of counting and figuring and thinking about Contemporary Society,

1508
00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:23.870
uh,

1509
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:24.071
you know,

1510
00:31:24.071 --> 00:31:24.980
Max Faber and,

1511
00:31:24.981 --> 00:31:25.490
and,

1512
00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:25.740
and,

1513
00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:26.261
and all that.

1514
00:31:26.261 --> 00:31:26.441
I mean,

1515
00:31:26.441 --> 00:31:28.060
really important important stuff,

1516
00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:29.320
positivism,

1517
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:30.120
uh,

1518
00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:30.953
all of this.

1519
00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:31.990
And so,

1520
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:32.860
um,

1521
00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:36.250
that's kind of censuses the developed way before all of this.

1522
00:31:36.251 --> 00:31:36.491
I mean,

1523
00:31:36.491 --> 00:31:38.050
the first sense is I said in France,

1524
00:31:38.051 --> 00:31:42.340
the first really accurate one outside of municipal ones is an in 1841.

1525
00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:43.870
But what they do is,

1526
00:31:43.871 --> 00:31:44.441
is they,

1527
00:31:44.441 --> 00:31:45.274
um,

1528
00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:48.700
they use sort of modern tools,

1529
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:49.070
uh,

1530
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:50.440
of censuses,

1531
00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.310
uh,

1532
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:56.310
surveys and questionnaires to get information on the entire population.

1533
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.990
And you better be damn careful when you write down who you are on one of these

1534
00:32:01.991 --> 00:32:02.441
forms.

1535
00:32:02.441 --> 00:32:03.040
When they say,

1536
00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.420
who is your grandfather?

1537
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:06.370
What did your grandfather do?

1538
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:07.570
You know,

1539
00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:08.140
what,

1540
00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:08.831
what are you going to write?

1541
00:32:08.831 --> 00:32:09.521
You can't write down.

1542
00:32:09.521 --> 00:32:11.530
He was that he was a industrial worker.

1543
00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:12.373
If you wasn't,

1544
00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:13.420
uh,

1545
00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:13.680
what,

1546
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.040
what if he's a Kulak?

1547
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.080
What if he's a noble?

1548
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:20.290
What if he's an Orthodox priest?

1549
00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:21.291
Well,

1550
00:32:21.291 --> 00:32:22.960
you're guilty by association,

1551
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:27.100
even another once a Kulak once a clergyman,

1552
00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:31.600
once an aristocrat buy class identity,

1553
00:32:31.601 --> 00:32:32.920
you are guilty.

1554
00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.540
You are guilty.

1555
00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:35.890
Uh,

1556
00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:36.850
and uh,

1557
00:32:36.851 --> 00:32:41.851
they use the censuses of 1926 in 1937 and the last one before the war of 1939 as

1558
00:32:45.561 --> 00:32:50.540
a way of deciding who should get passports and who shouldn't get passports

1559
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:54.020
and who should be be sent off,

1560
00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:55.100
uh,

1561
00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:55.670
to,

1562
00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:55.970
uh,

1563
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:56.803
wherever.

1564
00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.760
And so they're beginning the,

1565
00:32:58.890 --> 00:32:59.723
by 19,

1566
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:00.180
uh,

1567
00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.250
by 1934,

1568
00:33:01.251 --> 00:33:06.200
27 million people in the Soviet Union had been monitored.

1569
00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:08.280
And given state ID cards.

1570
00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:11.990
Now the French who had to have an ID card also to go from one department mall to

1571
00:33:11.991 --> 00:33:12.824
the next,

1572
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:13.700
to go from a,

1573
00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.550
to go from Massey to to a nice,

1574
00:33:16.551 --> 00:33:18.830
you had to have a passport and internal passport.

1575
00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.450
But what they do,

1576
00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:20.931
you know,

1577
00:33:20.931 --> 00:33:23.480
it's the same state thrust,

1578
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:24.290
uh,

1579
00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:28.520
except that it has a murderer's outcome because of you're classifying people.

1580
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.470
If you're counting people,

1581
00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:32.240
if you're registering people,

1582
00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:35.360
this is way before the quiet violence of the computer.

1583
00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.940
If we show up her whole memory memorably,

1584
00:33:37.941 --> 00:33:38.774
put it,

1585
00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:39.320
uh,

1586
00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:39.490
the,

1587
00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:41.180
but the outcome is,

1588
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:43.820
is very different.

1589
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.210
And they use archivist,

1590
00:33:45.211 --> 00:33:45.551
some of,

1591
00:33:45.551 --> 00:33:47.930
I have friends who are archivists and they're not going to be doing this kind of

1592
00:33:47.931 --> 00:33:48.081
thing.

1593
00:33:48.081 --> 00:33:49.550
And these are French archivists and,

1594
00:33:49.551 --> 00:33:50.360
and uh,

1595
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:50.980
um,

1596
00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:51.440
uh,

1597
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.150
but they're using archivists who I,

1598
00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:53.481
again,

1599
00:33:53.481 --> 00:33:54.620
I mean there are fearful for their life.

1600
00:33:54.621 --> 00:33:54.920
I mean,

1601
00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.910
you're an archivist,

1602
00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.080
you're a middleclass,

1603
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:58.040
you're an archivist with,

1604
00:33:58.041 --> 00:33:59.630
with writing and reading skills,

1605
00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:04.550
and you're potentially an enemy of the state because you're from the wrong

1606
00:34:04.551 --> 00:34:05.510
social class.

1607
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:06.763
And so they say,

1608
00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:07.491
we want you to,

1609
00:34:07.491 --> 00:34:07.701
you know,

1610
00:34:07.701 --> 00:34:09.380
we want to want to look at your archives.

1611
00:34:09.381 --> 00:34:13.910
We want you to find out who's in what category in your region.

1612
00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:15.920
And you better do it.

1613
00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.530
And archivists in [inaudible] in 1939,

1614
00:34:18.531 --> 00:34:23.531
coordinator Holquist identify 108,000 enemies of the people.

1615
00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:29.120
And once you're classified as an enemy of the people,

1616
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.823
baby,

1617
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.030
you're toast.

1618
00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:34.213
That's it.

1619
00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:35.300
That's it.

1620
00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:36.133
You're toast.

1621
00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:37.693
Now,

1622
00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.460
Sheila Fitzpatrick is a wonderful,

1623
00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:42.200
a wonderful historian.

1624
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:43.123
Um,

1625
00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.310
was one of the first to,

1626
00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:45.310
to,

1627
00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:50.560
to study what she calls the extraordinarily extraordinary everydayness of,

1628
00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:53.440
of Stalin Islam.

1629
00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:58.840
What was life like in a place where the only way of getting anything and

1630
00:35:02.361 --> 00:35:07.361
potentially the only way of surviving is your relationship to a bureaucratic

1631
00:35:08.301 --> 00:35:09.134
figure.

1632
00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:14.680
Because Stalin is the essence of state collectivization of state.

1633
00:35:14.931 --> 00:35:19.931
Totalitarianism is you have to have this enormous bureaucracy and it's the

1634
00:35:21.231 --> 00:35:23.420
bureaucracy that calls,

1635
00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:24.030
uh,

1636
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.201
uh,

1637
00:35:24.201 --> 00:35:25.034
that calls,

1638
00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:25.321
uh,

1639
00:35:25.321 --> 00:35:26.690
of the shots.

1640
00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:27.710
Um,

1641
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:28.543
and,

1642
00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:29.803
uh,

1643
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:32.720
it's the,

1644
00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:33.803
the,

1645
00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:34.610
the problem,

1646
00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:34.970
well,

1647
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:35.803
let me,

1648
00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.860
let me put some of the,

1649
00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:39.690
some of the points that are important

1650
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:43.050
in getting buy.

1651
00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:47.250
Who are apt to be the militants in all of this,

1652
00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:51.690
who are apt to be the true believers in all of this,

1653
00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:57.170
the most loyal to the project of creating this new world,

1654
00:35:58.231 --> 00:35:59.430
this new world that never came.

1655
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.460
The answer is young people,

1656
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.560
younger people,

1657
00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:06.090
uh,

1658
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:08.100
that there were many cases,

1659
00:36:08.101 --> 00:36:08.551
of course,

1660
00:36:08.551 --> 00:36:10.860
of younger people denouncing their parents,

1661
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:13.470
be asked to denounce their parents,

1662
00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:18.750
but the most militant and the most faithful where people who had not,

1663
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.910
who in the 1930 [inaudible] for example,

1664
00:36:20.911 --> 00:36:22.770
if they were 25 years old,

1665
00:36:22.771 --> 00:36:25.020
they didn't really remember the old regime.

1666
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.810
They didn't remember the czarist autocracy.

1667
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.130
And they are more,

1668
00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:34.140
more likely to think that there's nothing wrong with trying to decide who still

1669
00:36:34.141 --> 00:36:35.910
has religious icons on their walls,

1670
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:38.730
whose parents,

1671
00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:39.883
uh,

1672
00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:40.380
uh,

1673
00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.940
religiously went to church.

1674
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:42.780
Uh,

1675
00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:46.200
and so the young people were more apt to be,

1676
00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.130
uh,

1677
00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:47.380
uh,

1678
00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:50.940
after be the militants in all of this.

1679
00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.800
And if you were a militant,

1680
00:36:52.801 --> 00:36:55.650
what you did was you denounced class enemies,

1681
00:36:55.651 --> 00:36:57.180
these cool ox and the priests,

1682
00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.930
members of the pre-revolutionary,

1683
00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:00.270
a nobility,

1684
00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:01.590
former capitalists.

1685
00:37:01.591 --> 00:37:01.981
But again,

1686
00:37:01.981 --> 00:37:03.090
once a capitalist,

1687
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:04.680
you are always a capitalist.

1688
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.240
Once a Kulak you are always a cooler.

1689
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:08.370
Um,

1690
00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:12.570
and people who had be been declared as non toilers,

1691
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.880
that is not people who are not,

1692
00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:19.860
not really workers or really peasants who are cool ox.

1693
00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.410
They are deprived of the vote,

1694
00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:27.150
not that elections subsequently men and anything in the Soviet Union as early as

1695
00:37:27.151 --> 00:37:29.730
the constitution of 19,

1696
00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.160
uh,

1697
00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:30.993
18th.

1698
00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.450
And so these young Milt militants,

1699
00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:33.991
uh,

1700
00:37:33.991 --> 00:37:35.220
undertake a war on,

1701
00:37:35.221 --> 00:37:36.990
on bourgeois specialists.

1702
00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:37.441
Now,

1703
00:37:37.441 --> 00:37:38.400
one of the problems of course,

1704
00:37:38.401 --> 00:37:38.640
with,

1705
00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.390
with the,

1706
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:39.481
uh,

1707
00:37:39.481 --> 00:37:42.540
this is the campaign for rapid industrialization is they're really torn because

1708
00:37:42.541 --> 00:37:46.140
you need these bourgeois specialists because they're technocrats and they're the

1709
00:37:46.141 --> 00:37:48.930
ones that have to keep up the production a tall,

1710
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:49.681
I mean,

1711
00:37:49.681 --> 00:37:50.700
the production count,

1712
00:37:50.701 --> 00:37:51.690
they have to keep it up there.

1713
00:37:51.691 --> 00:37:52.680
But then you go into this period,

1714
00:37:52.681 --> 00:37:53.220
you'd say,

1715
00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:53.371
well,

1716
00:37:53.371 --> 00:37:56.190
you can't have a bunch of bourgeois specialists who are educated.

1717
00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.770
And so those people get liquidated,

1718
00:37:58.771 --> 00:37:59.640
maybe not killed,

1719
00:37:59.641 --> 00:37:59.821
but,

1720
00:37:59.821 --> 00:38:00.450
but get,

1721
00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:03.120
get removed and then they will bring in and replace them with.

1722
00:38:03.121 --> 00:38:05.730
Sometimes peasants would absolutely no education,

1723
00:38:05.731 --> 00:38:07.080
which is not their fault at all.

1724
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.380
The Soviets do educate people in this period.

1725
00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:10.861
Uh,

1726
00:38:10.861 --> 00:38:13.200
there's a huge increase in literacy in this period,

1727
00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:18.410
but they're turning over important management positions within the Soviet Union

1728
00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:21.600
in this push for rapid industrialization that people that can't read,

1729
00:38:21.601 --> 00:38:22.200
right.

1730
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:22.620
Uh,

1731
00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:23.460
and uh,

1732
00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:23.971
really,

1733
00:38:23.971 --> 00:38:24.241
you know,

1734
00:38:24.241 --> 00:38:26.130
just don't have the kind of,

1735
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:26.970
uh,

1736
00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:27.340
uh,

1737
00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:27.761
financial,

1738
00:38:27.761 --> 00:38:28.830
that kind of ability to,

1739
00:38:28.831 --> 00:38:29.371
to do it.

1740
00:38:29.371 --> 00:38:29.911
And then of course,

1741
00:38:29.911 --> 00:38:31.020
that causes all sorts of,

1742
00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:31.740
uh,

1743
00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:32.910
all sorts of problems.

1744
00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:33.660
Um,

1745
00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:34.493
and of course,

1746
00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:35.080
uh,

1747
00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:39.010
the bureaucracies and Kruth increasingly filled with people who are not

1748
00:38:39.011 --> 00:38:39.844
competent,

1749
00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:40.330
uh,

1750
00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:42.820
but are there because of their party loyalty.

1751
00:38:42.821 --> 00:38:44.200
And if you weren't loyal to the party,

1752
00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:44.591
uh,

1753
00:38:44.591 --> 00:38:45.430
there was nowhere.

1754
00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:48.130
I know where you're going to go.

1755
00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.010
How does this affect ordinary Soviet citizens,

1756
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.290
whether it's constant propaganda?

1757
00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:58.380
Talk about the radiant future and enormous sacrifices now will be worth it in

1758
00:38:58.541 --> 00:38:58.901
the end.

1759
00:38:58.901 --> 00:38:59.111
I mean,

1760
00:38:59.111 --> 00:38:59.440
Mark's,

1761
00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.101
after all said,

1762
00:39:00.101 --> 00:39:02.350
this been cited scientific socialism.

1763
00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:05.110
It's going to take a long time.

1764
00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:06.960
Thus,

1765
00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:07.480
uh,

1766
00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.021
the,

1767
00:39:08.021 --> 00:39:08.801
if you see these,

1768
00:39:08.801 --> 00:39:10.950
and I've been in the Moscow subway,

1769
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.220
well been a long time ago,

1770
00:39:12.221 --> 00:39:14.320
but he sort of heroic murals of,

1771
00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.040
of the,

1772
00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:15.341
of,

1773
00:39:15.341 --> 00:39:16.140
of the,

1774
00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:16.350
uh,

1775
00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:17.980
of the Soviet worker,

1776
00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:18.400
uh,

1777
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:18.671
the,

1778
00:39:18.671 --> 00:39:19.150
uh,

1779
00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:19.271
uh,

1780
00:39:19.271 --> 00:39:20.104
stack overnight.

1781
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:20.411
I mean,

1782
00:39:20.411 --> 00:39:20.981
don't write it down,

1783
00:39:20.981 --> 00:39:22.180
but this time I think he said the book,

1784
00:39:22.181 --> 00:39:26.020
but status that this guy stack Hoven off was a guy or whatever his name was,

1785
00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:26.720
who,

1786
00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:27.250
uh,

1787
00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:31.510
had apparently you'll set a world record by extracting the most coal any human

1788
00:39:31.511 --> 00:39:32.021
had ever done.

1789
00:39:32.021 --> 00:39:35.800
And of course it was basically made up and he became this kind of image of hard

1790
00:39:35.801 --> 00:39:36.070
work.

1791
00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:36.461
But I'll tell you,

1792
00:39:36.461 --> 00:39:37.210
if you go to,

1793
00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:39.800
if you go to a lot of this are art deco murals into,

1794
00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:40.361
in Detroit,

1795
00:39:40.361 --> 00:39:40.841
Michigan.

1796
00:39:40.841 --> 00:39:41.500
And the kind,

1797
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:42.670
or for example,

1798
00:39:42.671 --> 00:39:42.761
I'm,

1799
00:39:42.761 --> 00:39:44.560
I'm not making this as an analogy,

1800
00:39:44.561 --> 00:39:44.801
but,

1801
00:39:44.801 --> 00:39:48.430
but there was an equivalent under national socialism also the idea of the,

1802
00:39:48.431 --> 00:39:49.480
of the German worker,

1803
00:39:49.481 --> 00:39:49.990
you know,

1804
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:53.290
toiling away and all that with the interests of the state.

1805
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:54.840
But basically it's,

1806
00:39:54.841 --> 00:39:55.300
um,

1807
00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.170
the idea that,

1808
00:39:56.171 --> 00:39:56.411
that,

1809
00:39:56.411 --> 00:39:56.770
that,

1810
00:39:56.770 --> 00:40:00.040
that Russia could be moved by hard work out of backwardness,

1811
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.840
toward this radiant future.

1812
00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:02.810
It does keep people,

1813
00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.200
it does keep people going.

1814
00:40:05.201 --> 00:40:08.050
There's always this contrast between then the old days,

1815
00:40:08.051 --> 00:40:11.860
the battle days when these folks ruled the net men and the cooler box and the

1816
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:14.140
Aristotle aristocracy and all of that.

1817
00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:14.770
Uh,

1818
00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:15.460
and the,

1819
00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:15.671
the,

1820
00:40:15.671 --> 00:40:16.504
the inevitable,

1821
00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:16.801
uh,

1822
00:40:16.801 --> 00:40:19.360
a future that's the landlords were gone.

1823
00:40:19.361 --> 00:40:21.850
There's collective ownership of the means of production.

1824
00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:22.271
Uh,

1825
00:40:22.271 --> 00:40:24.130
so everything has got to be okay.

1826
00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:28.930
The motto is the Party is always right.

1827
00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:29.710
Uh,

1828
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:30.760
and you better believe it.

1829
00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:31.630
Um,

1830
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:31.950
and,

1831
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:33.790
and the state shaped the way,

1832
00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:34.240
uh,

1833
00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.000
people,

1834
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:35.320
uh,

1835
00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:35.711
uh,

1836
00:40:35.711 --> 00:40:36.311
people,

1837
00:40:36.311 --> 00:40:36.850
uh,

1838
00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:37.071
uh,

1839
00:40:37.071 --> 00:40:37.990
a lift.

1840
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:39.580
Now a part of it,

1841
00:40:39.581 --> 00:40:40.061
of course.

1842
00:40:40.061 --> 00:40:40.241
I mean,

1843
00:40:40.241 --> 00:40:42.370
those people lived through the purge.

1844
00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:42.881
I mean,

1845
00:40:42.881 --> 00:40:43.660
there's just,

1846
00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:43.931
well,

1847
00:40:43.931 --> 00:40:44.764
I'll tell you a story.

1848
00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:45.310
Um,

1849
00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:47.920
I had this colleague along long time ago when I first came here,

1850
00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:53.670
who grew up in Moscow in the 1930s because his father was the Persian ambassador

1851
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:56.710
to Moscow.

1852
00:40:57.650 --> 00:40:58.261
And this was the,

1853
00:40:58.261 --> 00:40:58.461
you know,

1854
00:40:58.461 --> 00:41:01.060
and the purchase people were announcing their parents and things like that.

1855
00:41:01.061 --> 00:41:04.230
People were being taken away in the night and there were boots in the hall and

1856
00:41:04.231 --> 00:41:05.890
it was a pretty damn scary time to live.

1857
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:07.870
And one day he was in this big school,

1858
00:41:07.871 --> 00:41:08.740
he was in [inaudible],

1859
00:41:08.741 --> 00:41:10.240
which is a middle school,

1860
00:41:10.241 --> 00:41:12.280
so he's 12 years old basically.

1861
00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:17.610
And he is sitting in one of these big buildings there and the bell rings,

1862
00:41:17.621 --> 00:41:22.621
you go from one class to the next class and the bell rang and the guy who's

1863
00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:23.830
sitting in front of him,

1864
00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:25.990
12 year old boy gets up,

1865
00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:26.841
he puts his car,

1866
00:41:26.841 --> 00:41:27.850
Tabu down,

1867
00:41:27.851 --> 00:41:28.091
his,

1868
00:41:28.091 --> 00:41:32.200
his book carrier down and he goes out there on the fifth floor.

1869
00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:35.870
He goes to the stairwell and he jumps over to his death just like that.

1870
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:37.550
He stepped over.

1871
00:41:37.551 --> 00:41:39.110
The thing fell.

1872
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:40.130
If you're 12 years old,

1873
00:41:40.131 --> 00:41:41.330
you're gonna remember that kind of thing.

1874
00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:42.350
Uh,

1875
00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:45.320
he didn't really know because you didn't discuss such things,

1876
00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:48.320
whether he had announced his parents and felt badly about it,

1877
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:50.090
whether it's parents had been taken away,

1878
00:41:50.091 --> 00:41:51.410
he didn't have any idea where they were.

1879
00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:52.250
Uh,

1880
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:53.420
but this was,

1881
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.910
this was one of the tragedies also.

1882
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.720
Uh,

1883
00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:57.760
and a lot of it is,

1884
00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:58.020
you know,

1885
00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:02.180
of course a lot of it is self deception and these were very work very for very

1886
00:42:02.181 --> 00:42:03.014
poor people.

1887
00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:06.260
And you believe in the radiant future because this is a very,

1888
00:42:06.261 --> 00:42:07.190
very poor place.

1889
00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:10.340
And you saw these stolen skyscrapers raising a,

1890
00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:11.570
there's a big debate in Warsaw,

1891
00:42:11.571 --> 00:42:16.430
whether the one that's there should be kept and you saw more literacy and you

1892
00:42:16.431 --> 00:42:19.490
saw sometimes products on the market,

1893
00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:21.710
but the deception was there.

1894
00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:23.240
They'll greats hopes were there.

1895
00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.890
The reality was completely different.

1896
00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.140
You would have bizarre things happen suddenly.

1897
00:42:27.141 --> 00:42:27.291
I mean,

1898
00:42:27.291 --> 00:42:28.310
you have state planning.

1899
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:32.270
So for awhile there were all these sort of red female stockings were on the

1900
00:42:32.271 --> 00:42:33.920
market because that was supposed to be cool.

1901
00:42:33.921 --> 00:42:37.490
And you had a lot of western visitors who had seen the same female,

1902
00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:37.730
uh,

1903
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:38.840
red stockings,

1904
00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:39.470
uh,

1905
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:40.400
which were very much in,

1906
00:42:40.401 --> 00:42:41.420
in Paris and Berlin,

1907
00:42:41.421 --> 00:42:42.830
but this wasn't Paris and Berlin,

1908
00:42:42.831 --> 00:42:42.981
this,

1909
00:42:42.981 --> 00:42:43.400
this,

1910
00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.121
this was Moscow.

1911
00:42:44.121 --> 00:42:45.410
So suddenly you have a lot of that.

1912
00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.670
Someone's thought,

1913
00:42:46.671 --> 00:42:47.120
well,

1914
00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:49.760
ketchup look good to the outsiders when they come.

1915
00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:51.260
And so they start producing ketchup.

1916
00:42:51.261 --> 00:42:52.610
There's nothing to put the ketchup on.

1917
00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:55.730
And the most ridiculous example I've ever heard is that they start producing

1918
00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.350
lots of bathtubs because you know,

1919
00:42:57.351 --> 00:42:59.120
people are waiting line to get apartments,

1920
00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:00.980
which is true until 1992,

1921
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:01.730
uh,

1922
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:02.541
they're waiting line to get,

1923
00:43:02.541 --> 00:43:03.080
depart,

1924
00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.250
get apartments.

1925
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.761
Uh,

1926
00:43:04.761 --> 00:43:05.840
though things got a lot better.

1927
00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:05.960
I,

1928
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:06.260
I,

1929
00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:06.441
you know,

1930
00:43:06.441 --> 00:43:07.161
after World War Two,

1931
00:43:07.161 --> 00:43:07.940
but still,

1932
00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:08.480
uh,

1933
00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:08.841
uh,

1934
00:43:08.841 --> 00:43:09.560
and so the,

1935
00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:10.740
if you're going to have an apartment that's,

1936
00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:11.810
that is a progress.

1937
00:43:11.811 --> 00:43:12.650
The radiant future,

1938
00:43:12.651 --> 00:43:13.640
you've gotta have a bathtub.

1939
00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:16.300
So they produce all these bathtubs,

1940
00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:18.170
but they forget to produce corks,

1941
00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:19.010
uh,

1942
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:19.880
or stoppers.

1943
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:23.090
So for a long time you had people that were lucky enough to have bath tubs,

1944
00:43:23.091 --> 00:43:24.470
but the water just runs out.

1945
00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.080
Uh,

1946
00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.660
and they could show them off to their friends.

1947
00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:28.010
Uh,

1948
00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:28.490
but it,

1949
00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:28.890
but it,

1950
00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:29.360
it just,

1951
00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:29.700
you know,

1952
00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:30.680
it's definitely doesn't work,

1953
00:43:30.681 --> 00:43:31.940
but there is the illusion,

1954
00:43:31.941 --> 00:43:35.060
and I'm going to have to end with this because I went to long earlier,

1955
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:36.471
there's more to say,

1956
00:43:36.471 --> 00:43:37.730
but there's always more to say.

1957
00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:41.450
There was the illusion and there were lots of true believers,

1958
00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:42.490
uh,

1959
00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:42.900
and,

1960
00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:47.570
and people who also wanted to radiant future and who,

1961
00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:48.110
you know,

1962
00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:48.381
I mean,

1963
00:43:48.381 --> 00:43:49.250
the 1960s,

1964
00:43:49.251 --> 00:43:50.390
we were also late,

1965
00:43:50.391 --> 00:43:51.081
1960s,

1966
00:43:51.081 --> 00:43:51.411
please,

1967
00:43:51.411 --> 00:43:52.191
not the early ones.

1968
00:43:52.191 --> 00:43:52.441
And,

1969
00:43:52.441 --> 00:43:53.060
and the,

1970
00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:54.650
the 70s we were all dealing with,

1971
00:43:54.651 --> 00:43:55.230
with,

1972
00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:55.640
with,

1973
00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:55.911
with,

1974
00:43:55.911 --> 00:43:56.101
you know,

1975
00:43:56.101 --> 00:43:57.210
our radiology of,

1976
00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:57.921
of the week.

1977
00:43:57.921 --> 00:44:00.890
And I had an uncle who made a great deal to me,

1978
00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:01.790
uh,

1979
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:03.930
who was a communist and he was,

1980
00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:06.320
he was trained in Berlin as a psychoanalyst.

1981
00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:07.190
Uh,

1982
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.851
and he,

1983
00:44:07.851 --> 00:44:08.390
uh,

1984
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:09.051
uh,

1985
00:44:09.051 --> 00:44:09.260
you know,

1986
00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:09.740
he worked for,

1987
00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:10.491
for both Pharma,

1988
00:44:10.491 --> 00:44:11.180
which is the,

1989
00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:11.901
the paper.

1990
00:44:11.901 --> 00:44:13.380
And he claimed to have known Demetrius [inaudible],

1991
00:44:13.381 --> 00:44:14.390
who was an important,

1992
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:14.870
uh,

1993
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:15.531
a communist.

1994
00:44:15.531 --> 00:44:16.940
And he was a true believer and I,

1995
00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.950
and he was a true believer always at the end of his life.

1996
00:44:18.951 --> 00:44:20.610
He ended up passing.

1997
00:44:20.611 --> 00:44:20.990
We're heading,

1998
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:23.180
his wife passed the save the whale petitions and,

1999
00:44:23.181 --> 00:44:23.700
and,

2000
00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:24.020
uh,

2001
00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.400
he was no longer a communist.

2002
00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:26.540
But I remember when I was a little boy,

2003
00:44:26.541 --> 00:44:29.810
him telling me that people trying to escape from communist communism were

2004
00:44:29.811 --> 00:44:30.644
psychotic.

2005
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:31.380
Uh,

2006
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:35.400
the people trying to get over the wall and Berlin were psychotic for trying to

2007
00:44:35.401 --> 00:44:38.880
leave this radiant future of a worker's Paradise.

2008
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.500
And there were a lot of true believers.

2009
00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:41.340
Uh,

2010
00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:42.031
and they,

2011
00:44:42.031 --> 00:44:42.631
these people,

2012
00:44:42.631 --> 00:44:43.201
a lot of them,

2013
00:44:43.201 --> 00:44:44.220
and I'm not dissing my uncle,

2014
00:44:44.221 --> 00:44:46.620
who I love deeply and who met a great deal on my life.

2015
00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:47.500
Um,

2016
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:47.790
and,

2017
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:49.020
and especially my aunt,

2018
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:49.790
but you know,

2019
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:50.070
they,

2020
00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:50.321
they,

2021
00:44:50.321 --> 00:44:51.121
they believed in,

2022
00:44:51.121 --> 00:44:52.860
people would go to the show trials and they will,

2023
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:54.030
they would see people saying,

2024
00:44:54.031 --> 00:44:54.361
yes,

2025
00:44:54.361 --> 00:44:55.410
I was in cahoots with,

2026
00:44:55.411 --> 00:44:55.681
with,

2027
00:44:55.681 --> 00:44:56.160
uh,

2028
00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:56.610
you know,

2029
00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:59.280
a Romanian fascist or with a Dutch,

2030
00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:00.750
a Dutch fascist,

2031
00:45:00.751 --> 00:45:01.081
or with,

2032
00:45:01.081 --> 00:45:01.470
uh,

2033
00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:01.760
uh,

2034
00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:01.980
uh,

2035
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:03.960
Georgia nationalist or something like that.

2036
00:45:03.961 --> 00:45:05.400
And they would admit to all sorts of things,

2037
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:07.980
possibly hoping was going to save their life.

2038
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.060
And it didn't,

2039
00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:09.893
it never did.

2040
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:11.310
And they were executed,

2041
00:45:11.330 --> 00:45:11.810
uh,

2042
00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:12.460
install an,

2043
00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:13.350
executed the mall.

2044
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:16.530
He executed the entire general staff practically of the army.

2045
00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.390
And one of the most amazing things about the,

2046
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:19.560
the second world wars,

2047
00:45:19.561 --> 00:45:21.120
how the Red Army,

2048
00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:25.950
how they not only survive but one and retraining people.

2049
00:45:25.951 --> 00:45:27.540
There weren't any admirals left or one.

2050
00:45:27.541 --> 00:45:28.440
There was nobody laughed.

2051
00:45:28.441 --> 00:45:29.760
They'd keep killed them all.

2052
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:32.000
He'd killed them all and it,

2053
00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:35.090
but people continue to believe they th they believed in.

2054
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:35.970
And the whole idea,

2055
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.590
the whole phrase maybe you've heard of is,

2056
00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:38.130
uh,

2057
00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:39.810
the phrase the Potemkin village.

2058
00:45:39.811 --> 00:45:43.080
And I guess that's a good place to end up Potemkin village.

2059
00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:44.401
If for example,

2060
00:45:44.401 --> 00:45:47.790
if you're watching an old TV western and you see a facade that you know,

2061
00:45:47.791 --> 00:45:50.340
get the bar and you've got Miss Kitty and you've got,

2062
00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:50.730
you know,

2063
00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:52.380
all of this and a few people,

2064
00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:52.650
you know,

2065
00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:53.670
punching each other out,

2066
00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:54.810
there's nothing behind it.

2067
00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:56.280
It's just all a fraud.

2068
00:45:56.281 --> 00:45:57.030
It's nothing.

2069
00:45:57.030 --> 00:46:00.480
And they would bring these visitors from the West in this brave new industrial

2070
00:46:00.481 --> 00:46:00.811
world.

2071
00:46:00.811 --> 00:46:01.644
And they see,

2072
00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:02.101
they see,

2073
00:46:02.101 --> 00:46:05.730
they see parts of towns that had been reshaped and they'd meet,

2074
00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.430
met the first,

2075
00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.110
they meet the first liver at people in a family.

2076
00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:11.130
And they were,

2077
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:12.150
it was very competitive,

2078
00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:12.811
was very true.

2079
00:46:12.811 --> 00:46:12.991
I mean,

2080
00:46:12.991 --> 00:46:13.980
some good things happen too,

2081
00:46:13.981 --> 00:46:14.221
but,

2082
00:46:14.221 --> 00:46:14.580
but,

2083
00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:14.881
but,

2084
00:46:14.881 --> 00:46:15.000
uh,

2085
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.320
they were far outweighed by,

2086
00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:17.460
by the bad things.

2087
00:46:17.461 --> 00:46:18.870
But a Potemkin village would be,

2088
00:46:18.871 --> 00:46:19.704
you'd go and you'd,

2089
00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:23.370
you'd see this facade and you'd be whisked through.

2090
00:46:23.371 --> 00:46:24.290
And this is where the,

2091
00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:26.190
the children's railroad will be.

2092
00:46:26.191 --> 00:46:27.240
And this is where the,

2093
00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:27.900
uh,

2094
00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:28.141
uh,

2095
00:46:28.141 --> 00:46:28.351
you know,

2096
00:46:28.351 --> 00:46:30.630
the kindergarten is going to be,

2097
00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.201
it's always,

2098
00:46:31.201 --> 00:46:32.100
they're going to be,

2099
00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.360
and it never happened.

2100
00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:34.111
And that,

2101
00:46:34.111 --> 00:46:37.200
I suppose it's the tragedy of the Russian,

2102
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:38.640
a revolution,

2103
00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:39.511
arguably.

2104
00:46:39.511 --> 00:46:39.901
Maybe,

2105
00:46:39.901 --> 00:46:40.734
who knows?

2106
00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:41.490
Uh,

2107
00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:43.500
a good idea gone terribly,

2108
00:46:43.501 --> 00:46:44.220
terribly bad.
